<text>Darrin Kenneth O&#x27;Brien (born October 30, 1969), known by his stage name Snow, is a Canadian reggae musician. His 1992 single &quot;Informer&quot; spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Early life==
Darrin Kenneth O&#x27;Brien was born on October 30, 1969 in North York, Ontario (now part of Toronto), one of four children born to an Irish-Canadian cabdriver and a homemaker. Following his parents&#x27; divorce, he was raised by his mother in the Allenbury Gardens public housing project where he became fascinated with the gangster lifestyle. Snow joined a tough Irish-Canadian group and became involved in a cycle of fighting, drinking and stealing. He never learned to read properly and dropped out of school while in the 9th grade. Growing up he had a strong interest in rock music, but after an influx of Jamaican immigrants moved to the neighborhood in 1983, his interest turned to reggae music, and he became adept at the use of the Jamaican dialect, or Jamaican Patois. He developed his own style of music, by blending dancehall and reggae with rock and pop music.

In 1987, Snow served eight months of a one-year sentence after pleading guilty to beating a person with a crowbar during a bar brawl. Upon Snow&#x27;s release in January 1988, the Jamaican-born DJ Marvin Prince saw O&#x27;Brien deejaying at a party and the two became friends. For the next few years, they practiced in Prince&#x27;s basement, and played parties, with Snow providing vocals and Prince playing records. Prince, who would later claim that he helped Snow refine his reggae singing and use of the Jamaican dialect, and that he came up with the name &#x27;Snow&#x27;, told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that they passed around a lot of tapes but could not get Snow signed because he was white.

In 1988, Snow was involved in an incident at a North York pub, in which two people were stabbed &quot;in the lane&quot;; he was accused, and was subsequently charged with two counts of attempted murder. Snow served eight months in jail before a jury acquitted him on both counts. While he was in jail, he wrote music, which he performed for fellow inmates. &quot;Informer&quot; was one of the songs he wrote during his incarceration.

==Career==
On a trip to New York, Prince was able to pitch Snow&#x27;s music to rap star M.C. Shan. In 1991, Snow went to New York, where Shan introduced him to music producers David Eng and Steve Salem. Snow signed a contract to record on their Motorjam/Elektra record label, then they recorded his debut album &quot;12 Inches of Snow&quot;. Due to Snow&#x27;s impending return to prison, the album was recorded very quickly.

&quot;12 Inches of Snow&quot; was released in 1992, while Snow was in prison. Shan, Eng, Salem, and Prince promoted it and, by the time Snow was released from prison, the single &quot;Informer&quot; was a chart-topping hit. &quot;12 Inches of Snow&quot; sold over 8 million copies worldwide, with the &quot;Informer&quot; single remaining number 1 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for seven consecutive weeks. &quot;Informer&quot; has been recorded twice in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the best-selling reggae single in US history, as well as the highest charting reggae single in history. A second single, &quot;Girl I&#x27;ve Been Hurt&quot;, reached Number 19 on the Hot 100. In Japan, Snow received the Recording Industry Association of Japan&#x27;s 1994 Japan Gold Disc Award for New Artist of the Year.

=== Origin of stage name ===
After one of Snow&#x27;s neighbouring Jamaican families first introduced him to reggae, Snow began borrowing and ordering reggae dub tapes to perform over. After he befriended Marvin Prince, the latter gave O&#x27;Brien the stage name &quot;Snow&quot;a backronym meaning &quot;Superb Notorious Outrageous Whiteboy&quot;. Snow never claimed the title himself, but did continue to perform with the stage name &quot;Snow&quot;. The origin of Snow&#x27;s stage name would become a central issue in the legal battle between Prince and O&#x27;Brien.

=== Legal disputes over production of &quot;12 Inches of Snow&quot; ===
While touring as Snow&#x27;s DJ in December 1994, Marvin Prince abruptly left the tour after discovering that Snow, according to court documents, &quot;was receiving more money from management than he was.&quot; While listed as only the writer of the song &quot;Runway&quot; on the &quot;12 Inches of Snow&quot; album, Prince claimed to have co-written five songs and co-produced the album with Shan, Eng, and Salem. Prince alleged that Eng and Salem provided &quot;a draft of a multi-album production and recording agreement&quot; to both Snow and himself. Unable to understand the contract, Snow allegedly &quot;sent a copy to his mother to get legal advice from her friend&quot; and Prince &quot;never saw the agreement again.&quot; Moreover, Prince claimed to have entered an &quot;oral agreement&quot; with Snow implying that the two would share profits from the album &quot;fifty-fifty&quot;. The first agreement, Prince alleged, occurred &quot;in 1990, when the two men began working together on songs in Prince&#x27;s basement and he &quot;allegedly suggested to&quot; Snow, &quot;if something comes out of this, let&#x27;s be partners.&quot; The second oral agreement, according to Prince, took place in August 1991 while Snow auditioned for Shan. Snow referred to Prince as his partner in a promotional video, but claimed to have used the term &quot;only in the slang sense.&quot; Prince &quot;admitted that these discussions were not concrete; the parties never organized a formal business plan, nor was plaintiff in New York to advance defendant&#x27;s career.&quot;

Shan, Eng, and Salem testified that they were unaware of a partnership between Snow and Prince, and Shan denied that Prince co-produced &quot;12 Inches of Snow&quot; and co-wrote the five songs in question. &quot;Informer&quot;, for example, was officially written by Snow, Shan, and composer Edmond Leary. Years later, after Snow and Prince had their falling out, Prince unsuccessfully sued Snow for compensation. While Prince had initially been awarded a $1.5 million settlement by a jury, the court overturned the original ruling and dismissed Prince&#x27;s suit on the grounds that he had &quot;no viable claims&quot; to a partnership with Snow.

In a 2019 interview, Prince recounted his history with Snow and described how he mentored, recorded demos for, scheduled showcase performances for, and ultimately, arranged for Snow to audition for MC Shan. Prince recounted how he and Snow wrote &quot;Informer&quot; over the phone while Snow was serving his sentence at Maplehurst Correctional Complex. Prince recalled playing Junior Reid&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Mind&quot; over the phone, and Snow used the track&#x27;s flute melody as the basis for &quot;Informer&quot;. Parts of the first verse and third verse of &quot;Informer&quot;, according to Prince, were reworked from Eek-A-Mouse&#x27;s performance of &quot;Tell Them&quot; at Sunsplash 1981. Originally, Prince alleges, the final verse of &quot;Informer&quot; was written and performed by a second vocalist named &quot;Little Red&quot;. Prince maintains that the judge who overturned the original ruling did so illegally, and he believes race played a role in the judge&#x27;s decision.

Co-producer and co-writer Edmond Leary later claimed M.C. Shan unfairly received most of the production credits for &quot;12 Inches of Snow&quot;. He told Vice, &quot;So actually, if you want the truth of the matter, if we hadn&#x27;t done it equally and had to split up the money I would have gotten 70% of writer&#x27;s [royalties] off that album they probably would have split up 30, because I wrote most of that album. Most of the words were mine, and the ideas and structures and backgrounds in the vocal booth with me telling him what keys to sing the harmonies in and what have you. So I had a lot to do with that sound that became so popular and went Platinum.&quot; After struggling with a cocaine addiction and homelessness, in 2013 Leary was a street performer at Madison Square Park and Union Square.

=== International success ===
In 1994, Snow collaborated with Cyndi Lauper on Junior Vasquez&#x27;s &quot;Homegrown&quot; and Sly and Robbie&#x27;s &quot;Pop Goes the Dancehall&quot; remix of &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;, retitled &quot;Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)&quot;.

Eng had a studio in Jamaica and, in 1994, Snow recorded his second album &quot;Murder Love&quot; in Jamaica, Canada, and New York. While not a commercial success in North America, the album featured Snow performing with reggae and dancehall musicians Ninjaman, Junior Reid, Half Pint, Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Dave Kelly, and Sly and Robbie. The &quot;Anything for You&quot; remix became a club favorite and, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Elena Oumano, made Snow a figure of respect on the Jamaican music scene. &quot;Anything For You&quot; became the top-selling single in Jamaica in 1995 and &quot;Si Wi Dem Nuh Know We&quot; also reached the number one slot in Jamaica. &quot;Murder Love&quot; proved to be a popular album in Asia, with the single &quot;Sexy Girl&quot; remaining on Japan&#x27;s Top Singles chart for 16 weeks, ultimately reaching number one.

The success of &quot;Murder Love&quot; allowed Snow to tour Asia and collaborate with Thai rap artist Joey Boy. In 1996, Eng established an office in Bangkok, founded Dimsum Entertainment, and included Snow in this expansion. In 1996, Eng produced Joey Boy&#x27;s album &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;. Snow performed on the chart-topping Thai single &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; and appeared in the music video. Joey Boy appeared on Snow&#x27;s Thai single &quot;Me and Joey&quot;. In 2008, Snow also featured Joey Boy on the track &quot;Catch a Kick&quot;.

By the end of 1996, &quot;Murder Love&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Si We Dem Nuh Know We&quot; received a Juno nomination for Best Reggae Recording. Overall, the album produced three music videos: &quot;Anything For You&quot;, &quot;Anything For You (All Star Cast Remix)&quot;, and &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;. In the 1995 film &quot;Klash&quot;, Snow appears performing &quot;Rivertown&quot;.

Snow followed up &quot;Murder Love&quot; with an album named after his daughter, &quot;Justuss&quot;. The first single &quot;Boom Boom Boogie&quot; took Asia by storm, achieving gold status with the music video appearing on MTV Japan five to six times a day. Released in the United States and Canada in 1997, the single &quot;If This World Were Mine&quot; failed to chart but the video regularly appeared on The Box. The album reached number 12 on the U.S. reggae charts and in 1998 was nominated for Best Reggae album at the Juno Awards in Vancouver, British Columbia. In late 1997, Snow released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, called &quot;The Greatest Hits of Snow&quot;.

In 1999, Snow reunited with M.C. Shan, producing the album &quot;Cooler Conditions&quot; in Japan. The only single, &quot;The Plumb Song&quot;, spent eight weeks on the Japan Singles chart, peaking at number 27. It was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario.

=== Return to the Canadian charts ===
In 2000, Snow signed to Virgin Music Canada. Later that year, he released the album &quot;Mind on the Moon&quot;. The single &quot;Everybody Wants to Be Like You&quot; landed Snow back on the Canadian Singles chart and earned him three Juno nominations.

In 2002, Snow worked with Shaggy and Blu Cantrell&#x27;s producer to record &quot;Two Hands Clapping&quot;. &quot;Legal&quot;, the first single, reached number 13 on the Canadian Singles Chart.

=== 2013–present ===
In 2013, after Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer complained about the company&#x27;s &quot;hold&quot; music during a fourth-quarter earnings call, Snow and the Jingle Punks recorded a much publicized jingle for Yahoo. The lyrics went, &quot;You&#x27;re on hold / Hold on at Yahoo / Gimme a second while I patch you through,&quot; goes the first verse. &quot;The CEO didn&#x27;t like the hold music / So Daddy Snow wrote this jam for you.&quot;

In summer 2014 while in Miami, Florida, Snow signed with Bugatti Music Entertainment and teamed up with Grammy-winning producers Cool &amp; Dre, Kent Jones and Scott Storch and began recording again.

On October 2, 2014, Snow&#x27;s new single &quot;Shame&quot; was released, featuring Mykal Rose (Black Uhuru). On October 11, 2014, Snow announced that all proceeds from &quot;Shame&quot; will be donated to the fight against cancer.

On June 19, 2017, Snow was awarded the Socan Classics 100,000 Radio Performances in Canada for commemorating more than 100k times his music has played on radio.

On January 23, 2019, Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee released the reggaeton and dancehall song &quot;Con Calma&quot; featuring Snow, which has been described as a remake or reimagination of &quot;Informer&quot;. The single peaked at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Snow&#x27;s first entry on the chart since 1993, and reached number one on the US Hot Latin Songs list. Internationally, the track topped the charts of five Spanish-language countries and reached the top 10 in 10 others in Latin America. Across Europe, the song entered the charts of numerous countries, peaking at number 14 in Italy and number 23 in Switzerland. In the Netherlands, the song rose to number one in April 2019. &quot;Con Calma&quot; also became Snow&#x27;s first entry on the Canadian Hot 100 chart after debuting at number 99 in February 2019. It eventually peaked at number 6.

On October 17, 2019, Snow and his wife Tara O&#x27;Brien attended the 5th Annual Latin American Music Awards in Hollywood, California at the Dolby Theatre. Snow was nominated for three awards.

In February 2020, Snow won four awards Song of the Year with Daddy Yankee for &quot;Con Calma&quot; at &quot;Premio Lo Nuestro Awards.&quot;

In March 2020, Snow was given the Pop Music Award from SOCAN.

Snow and Daddy Yankee won the Top Latin Song of the Year at the 2020 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, and &quot;Con Calma&quot; won big at the Latin &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards on October 21, 2020, with Snow taking home six awards. Snow attended the awards with Tara O&#x27;Brien in Florida.

== Television and film appearances ==
Drew Carey, a long time Snow fan, had Snow record a reggae version of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; theme song, &quot;Moon Over Parma&quot;, for the series&#x27; eighth and ninth seasons.

In 1995, Snow appears as himself in concert performance in the movie &quot;Kla$h&quot;, Snow performs onstage and does a scene in which he is interviewed by Jamaican media in the film directed by Bill Parker and produced by Kingston Pictures.

In 2001, Snow played a prison guard in the film &quot;Prison Song&quot;. Snow appears as himself in the 2012 film &quot;The Movie Out Here&quot; produced by Canadian brewing company Kokanee and Alliance Films.

In 2015, Snow and his then-fiancée, Tara Elizabeth, appeared on a CBC webseries called &quot;True Dating Stories&quot; to tell the story of one of their first dates: a walk in a ravine turned police operation. Their episode was the most watched and the entire series won Best Web Series at the Hollywood Comedy Shorts Film Festival.

== Ethnicity and Canadian identity ==
In &quot;Ethnicity, Politics, and Public Policy: Case Studies in Canadian Diversity&quot;, Rebecca J. Haines examined Snow as a symbol of Canadian ethnic identity. Instead of hiding his &quot;whiteness&quot; and &quot;Canadian-ness&quot;, Haines argues, Snow proudly boasts of his Irish heritage and pride in his family, the O&#x27;Briens, and traces his reggae roots to the diverse community of Allenbury. While other artists, such as Snoop Dogg, don a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey because of its resemblance to cannabis, &quot;in the video for his single &quot;Anything for You&quot;, shot on location in Jamaica, the white Canadian reggae artist Snow is seen wearing the same jersey, perhaps in an attempt to proclaim his Canadian roots among the all-black cast of this video.&quot;

Many reggae purists viewed Snow, along with Ini Kamoze, Diana King, UB40, Shaggy and Shabba Ranks, as another example of &quot;watered-down&quot; commercial reggae that rose to international popularity in the 1990s. The sketch comedy show &quot;In Living Color&quot; parodied &quot;Informer&quot; by featuring fellow Canadian Jim Carrey as Snow in a sketch titled &quot;Imposter&quot;.

In 1996, WBLS New York disc jockey Pat McKay observed, &quot;purists have a problem with a non-Jamaican doing reggae. But I choose to think of it as the greatest compliment to reggae culture, and Snow is a genuine, dedicated artist. He has a fine singing voice, he&#x27;s a great writer, and he very generously includes other artists in all of his work. His authenticity amplifies the realities of his generation, and his sensitivity conjures up intimacy with all of his love songs.&quot;

==Personal life==
In November 2009, Snow&#x27;s then common-law wife and the subject of many of his songs, Tamei Edberg, was diagnosed with cancer; she died three weeks later on November 27, 2009, at age 41. With Tamei, Snow has a daughter born in 1996. 

On June 24, 2010, Snow held a fundraiser called &quot;ClosURE For Cancer&quot; at Alley Catz Restaurant in Toronto during which they raised $15,000. Snow founded his own nongovernmental organization called Pure Snow NGO, which assists &quot;tenants living in non-profit housing&quot;.

In May 2016, Snow married model and actress Tara Elizabeth Singh at St. Anselm Catholic Church in Toronto. CTV covered the ceremony, and local radio station KISS 92.5 interviewed the newlyweds on &quot;The Roz and Mocha Show&quot; on May 22, 2016.

<doc id="502793" wikidata="Q1284987" url="?curid=502793" title="Jean de Thévenot">
<text>Jean de Thévenot (16 June 1633 – 28 November 1667) was a French traveller in the East, who wrote extensively about his journeys. He was also a linguist, natural scientist and botanist.

==Education==
He was born in Paris and received his education in the Collège de Navarre. He was a nephew of Melchisédech Thévenot, with whom he is often confused.

==Early European travels (1652-1655)==
Thévenot conceived a desire to travel from reading other travel writing, and his wealth allowed him to fulfill this desire. Leaving France in 1652, he first visited England, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. At Rome he fell in with D&#x27;Herbelot, who invited him to be his companion in a projected voyage to the Levant. D&#x27;Herbelot was detained by private affairs, but Thévenot sailed from Rome in May 1655, and, after vainly waiting five months at Malta, took passage for Constantinople alone.

==First travels to the Near and Middle East (1655-1663)==
He remained in Constantinople until the following August, and then proceeded to Smyrna, the Greek islands, and finally to Egypt, landing at Alexandria on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1657. He stayed for a year in Egypt, then visited Sinai, and, upon returning to Cairo, joined the Lent pilgrim caravan to Jerusalem. He visited the chief places of pilgrimage in Palestine, and, after being twice taken by corsairs, got back to Damietta by sea, and was again in Cairo in time to view the opening of the canal on the rise of the Nile (14 August 1658).

In January 1659 he sailed from Alexandria in an English ship, visiting Goletta and Tunis (Tunisia) on the way, and, after a sharp engagement with Spanish corsairs, one of which fell a prize to the English merchantman, reached Leghorn (Italy) on 12 April. He now spent four years at home in studies useful to a traveller.

==Further travels (1663-1667)==
In November 1663 again sailed for the East, calling at Alexandria and landing at Sidon, whence he proceeded by land to Damascus, Aleppo, and then through Mesopotamia to Mosul, Baghdad and Mendeli.

Here he entered Persia (27 August 1664), proceeding by Kermanshah and Hamadan to Isfahan, where he spent five months (October 1664 - February 1665), and then joining company with the merchant Tavernier, proceeded by Shiraz and Lar to Bander-Abbasi, in the hope of finding a passage to India. This was difficult, because of the opposition of the Dutch, and though Tavernier was able to proceed, Thévenot found it prudent to return to Shiraz. Having visited the ruins of Persepolis, he made his way to Basra and sailed for India on 6 November 1665, in the ship &quot;Hopewell,&quot; arriving at the port of Surat on 10 January 1666.

He was in Mughal Empire of India for thirteen months, and crossed the country by Golconda to Masulipatam, returning overland to Surat, from which he sailed to Bander-Abbasi and went up to Shiraz. He passed the summer of 1667 at Isfahan, disabled by an accidental pistol-shot; and in October started for Tabriz, but died on the way at Mianeh on 28 November 1667.

==Linguistic skills and natural sciences==
Thévenot was an accomplished polyglot, skilled in Turkish, Arabic and Persian, and a curious and diligent observer. He was also well skilled in natural sciences, especially in botany, for which he made large collections in India.

==Travel writing==
The account of his first journey was published at Paris in 1665, under the title &quot;Relation d’un voyage fait au Levant&quot;. It forms the first part of his collected &quot;Voyages&quot;. The licence is dated December 1663, and the preface shows that Thévenot himself arranged it for publication before leaving on his second voyage. Among other things, he was one of the European travellers to include a story about the origins of the medieval Arabic document, the &quot;Achtiname&quot; of Muhammad, which claims that the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, had personally confirmed a grant of protection and other privileges to the monks of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in Egypt.

The second and third parts of Thévenot&#x27;s &quot;Voyages&quot; were posthumously published from his journals in 1674 and 1684 (all quarto). A collected edition appeared at Paris in 1689, duodecimos the same year and at Amsterdam in 1727 (5 vols.). There is an early English translation by A. Lovell (folio, London, 1687).

<doc id="502797" wikidata="Q1933634" url="?curid=502797" title="Snow (ship)">
<text>In sailing, a snow, snaw or snauw is a square-rigged vessel with two masts, complemented by a snow- or trysail-mast stepped immediately abaft (behind) the main mast.

== History ==
The word &#x27;snow&#x27; comes from &#x27;snauw&#x27;, which is an old Dutch word for beak, a reference to the characteristic sharp bow of the vessel. The snow evolved from the (three-masted) ship: the mizzen mast of a ship was gradually moved closer towards the mainmast, until the mizzen mast was no longer a separate mast, but was instead made fast at the main mast top. As such, in the 17th century the snow used to be sometimes classified as a three-masted vessel.

The snow dates back to the late 17th century and originally had a loose-footed gaff sail; the boom was introduced somewhere in the 18th century. It was a popular type of vessel in the Baltic Sea and was employed by a large number of nations during its time. The snow was considered a handy and fast sailing vessel, typically the largest two-masted vessel around, and was employed in both navy and merchant service. When used as a naval vessel, snows were, in the early 18th century, typically fitted with 5 to 16 guns. Naval snows were mostly used for coastal patrols and privateering whereas in the merchant service snows traded all the way to the Mediterranean and sometimes even sailed as far as the West Indies.

== Comparison with brig ==
While the snow and the brig might appear closely related, this is in fact not the case. The two rigs developed from different directions, the brig evolving from the generally smaller brigantine, and the much older snow evolving from the larger three-masted ship.

The most visible difference between the brig and the snow is the latter&#x27;s &quot;snow-mast&quot;, stepped directly behind the main mast. In contrast to the brig, where the gaff and boom attach directly to the main mast, a snow&#x27;s gaff, and in later times, its boom, were attached to the snow-mast. The use of this characteristic snow-mast offered several advantages over attaching the gaff directly to the main mast.

The yoke (or jaw) of the gaff and the lacing of the gaff sail on a snow could move freely on the snow mast, unhindered by the iron bands that held together the (main) mast, nor limited by the main yard. The gaff on the snow mast could be raised higher than the main yard and independently of it. The resulting freedom allowed a snow, in contrast to a brig, to fly a main course without complications, as they typically did.

However, in the late 18th century, brigs started to set main courses as well, which gave rise to the term snow-brig. The differences lessened even further when the snow-mast was replaced by a steel cable, at which point the term &quot;snow-brig&quot; gradually became interchangeable with the term &quot;brig&quot; and the term &quot;snow&quot; fell in disuse.

The twin brigs and , American warships which participated in the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813, were both snow-brigs.

<text>This is a list of weapons served individually by the United States armed forces. While the general understanding is that crew-served weapons require more than one person to operate them, there are important exceptions in the case for both squad automatic weapons (SAW) and sniper rifles. Within the Table of Organization and Equipment for both the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps, these two classes of weapons are considered as crew-served; the operator of the weapon has an assistant who carries additional ammunition and associated equipment, acts as a spotter, and is also fully qualified in the operation of the weapon. These weapons are listed under the List of crew-served weapons of the U.S. armed forces.

<text>In particle, atomic and condensed matter physics, a Yukawa potential (also called a screened Coulomb potential) is a potential named after the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa. The potential is of the form:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is a magnitude scaling constant, i.e. is the amplitude of potential, is the mass of the particle, is the radial distance to the particle, and is another scaling constant, so that formula_3 is the approximate range. The potential is monotonically increasing in and it is negative, implying the force is attractive. In the SI system, the unit of the Yukawa potential is the inverse meter.

The Coulomb potential of electromagnetism is an example of a Yukawa potential with the formula_4 factor equal to 1, everywhere. This can be interpreted as saying that the photon mass is equal to 0. The photon is the force-carrier between interacting, charged particles.

In interactions between a meson field and a fermion field, the constant formula_2 is equal to the gauge coupling constant between those fields. In the case of the nuclear force, the fermions would be a proton and another proton or a neutron.

== History ==
Prior to Hideki Yukawa&#x27;s 1935 paper, physicists struggled to explain the results of James Chadwick&#x27;s atomic model, which consisted of positively charged protons and neutrons packed inside of a small nucleus, with a radius on the order of 10−14 meters. Physicists knew that electromagnetic forces at these lengths would cause these protons to repel each other and for the nucleus to fall apart. Thus came the motivation for further explaining the interactions between elementary particles. In 1932, Werner Heisenberg proposed a &quot;Platzwechsel&quot; (migration) interaction between the neutrons and protons inside the nucleus, in which neutrons were composite particles of protons and electrons. These composite neutrons would emit electrons, creating an attractive force with the protons, and then turn into protons themselves. When, in 1933 at the Solvay Conference, Heisenberg proposed his interaction, physicists suspected it to be of either two forms:

:formula_6

on account of its short-range. However, there were many issues with his theory. For one, it is impossible for an electron of spin and a proton of spin to add up to the neutron spin of . The way Heisenberg treated this issue would go on to form the ideas of isospin.

Heisenberg&#x27;s idea of an exchange interaction (rather than a Coulombic force) between particles inside the nucleus led Fermi to formulate his ideas on beta-decay in 1934. Fermi&#x27;s neutron-proton interaction was not based on the &quot;migration&quot; of neutrons and protons between each other. Instead, Fermi proposed the emission and absorption of two light particles: the neutrino and electron, rather than just the electron (as in Heisenberg&#x27;s theory). While Fermi&#x27;s interaction solved the issue of the conservation of linear and angular momentum, Soviet physicists Igor Tamm and Dmitri Ivanenko demonstrated that the force associated with the neutrino and electron emission was not strong enough to bind the protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

In his February 1935 paper, Hideki Yukawa combines both the idea of Heisenberg&#x27;s short-range force interaction and Fermi&#x27;s idea of an exchange particle in order to fix the issue of the neutron-proton interaction. He deduced a potential which includes an exponential decay term (formula_4) and an electromagnetic term (formula_8). In analogy to quantum field theory, Yukawa knew that the potential and its corresponding field must be a result of an exchange particle. In the case of QED, this exchange particle was a photon of 0 mass. In Yukawa&#x27;s case, the exchange particle had some mass, which was related to the range of interaction (given by formula_9). Since the range of the nuclear force was known, Yukawa used his equation to predict the mass of the mediating particle as about 200 times the mass of the electron. Physicists called this particle the &quot;meson,&quot; as its mass was in the middle of the proton and electron. Yukawa&#x27;s meson was found in 1947, and came to be known as the pion.

==Relation to Coulomb potential==

If the particle has no mass (i.e., ), then the Yukawa potential reduces to a Coulomb potential, and the range is said to be infinite. In fact, we have:

:formula_10
Consequently, the equation
:formula_11
simplifies to the form of the Coulomb potential
:formula_12

where we set the scaling constant to be:

:formula_13

A comparison of the long range potential strength for Yukawa and Coulomb is shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that the Coulomb potential has effect over a greater distance whereas the Yukawa potential approaches zero rather quickly. However, any Yukawa potential or Coulomb potential is non-zero for any large .

The Yukawa potential can be thought of as arising from modifying the electromagnetic wave equation to describe a particle with nonzero mass. 

The electromagnetic wave equation reads 
formula_14.
Where formula_15 is the electromagnetic four-potential and formula_16. The potential will go as formula_17 for a point source. 

This wave equation describes a photon. For the nuclear force, we hope to describe pions. The pion can be described by a scalar field, as opposed to a vector, and we modify the wave equation by adding a multiple of the field (which doesn&#x27;t affect relativistic invariance):

formula_18

If formula_19 depends only on the radius formula_20 in spherical coordinates and is time independent, then we have formula_21. 

Using the expression for the Laplacian in spherical coordinates formula_22 we get 

formula_23 

which has solutions
formula_24 so that
formula_25 which is the Yukawa potential.

For the photon, a wave solution will look like formula_26. We can substitute this in to the homogenous electromagnetic wave equation to obtain
formula_27,

By using the Plank relation formula_28 and the de Broglie relation formula_29, we get

formula_30

The mass-energy equivalence tells us that formula_31, so this tells us that the photon is massless.

If we repeat this analysis for the pion, we get
formula_32, which tells us that the meson has a mass of formula_33.

formula_34 can be estimated from the observed range of the nuclear forces. The nuclear force has a range on the order of femtometers (formula_35), and therefore the pion mass should be about formula_36, close to the actual value of around formula_37.

==Fourier transform==
The easiest way to understand that the Yukawa potential is associated with a massive field is by examining its Fourier transform. One has

:formula_38

where the integral is performed over all possible values of the 3-vector momenta . In this form, and setting the scaling factor to one, formula_39, the fraction formula_40 is seen to be the propagator or Green&#x27;s function of the Klein–Gordon equation.

==Feynman amplitude==

The Yukawa potential can be derived as the lowest order amplitude of the interaction of a pair of fermions. The Yukawa interaction couples the fermion field formula_41 to the meson field formula_42 with the coupling term

:formula_43

The scattering amplitude for two fermions, one with initial momentum formula_44 and the other with momentum formula_45, exchanging a meson with momentum , is given by the Feynman diagram on the right.

The Feynman rules for each vertex associate a factor of formula_2 with the amplitude; since this diagram has two vertices, the total amplitude will have a factor of formula_47. The line in the middle, connecting the two fermion lines, represents the exchange of a meson. The Feynman rule for a particle exchange is to use the propagator; the propagator for a massive meson is formula_48. Thus, we see that the Feynman amplitude for this graph is nothing more than

:formula_49

From the previous section, this is seen to be the Fourier transform of the Yukawa potential.
==Eigenvalues of Schrödinger equation==
The radial Schrödinger equation with Yukawa potential can be solved perturbatively. Using the radial Schrödinger equation in the form
:formula_50
and the Yukawa potential in the power-expanded form
:formula_51
and setting formula_52, one obtains for the angular momentum formula_53 the expression
:formula_54
for formula_55, where
:formula_56

Setting all coefficients formula_57 except formula_58 equal to zero, one obtains the well-known expression for the Schrödinger eigenvalue for the Coulomb potential, and the radial quantum number formula_59 is a positive integer or zero as a consequence of the boundary conditions which the wave functions of the Coulomb potential have to satisfy. In the case of the Yukawa potential the imposition of boundary conditions is more complicated. Thus in the Yukawa case formula_60 is only an approximation and the parameter formula_61 that replaces the integer is really an asymptotic expansion like that above with first approximation the integer value of the corresponding Coulomb case.
The above expansion for the orbital angular momentum or Regge trajectory formula_62 can be reversed to obtain the energy eigenvalues or equivalently formula_63. One obtains:
:formula_64

The above asymptotic expansion of the angular momentum formula_62 in descending powers of formula_66 can also be derived with the WKB method. In that case, however, as in the case of the Coulomb potential the expression formula_67 in the centrifugal term of the Schrödinger equation has to be replaced by formula_68, as was argued originally by Langer, the reason being that the singularity is too strong for an unchanged application of the WKB method. That this reasoning is correct follows from the WKB derivation of the correct result in the Coulomb case (with the Langer correction), and even of the above expansion in the Yukawa case with higher order WKB approximations.

== Cross section ==
We can calculate the differential cross section between a proton or neutron and the pion by making use of the Yukawa potential. We use the Born approximation, which tells us that, in a spherically symmetrical potential, we can approximate the outgoing scattered wave function as the sum of incoming plane wave function and a small perturbation:

:formula_69

where formula_70 is the particle&#x27;s incoming momentum. The function formula_71 is given by:

:formula_72

where formula_73 is the particle&#x27;s outgoing scattered momentum and formula_74 is the incoming particles&#x27; mass (not to be confused with formula_75 the pion&#x27;s mass). We calculate formula_71 by plugging in formula_77:

:formula_78

Evaluating the integral gives

:formula_79

Energy conservation implies

:formula_80

so that

:formula_81

Plugging in, we get:

:formula_82

We thus get a differential cross section of:

:formula_83

Integrating, the total cross section is:
:formula_84

==Spherical shell==
The potential outside of an infinitesimally thin, uniform spherical shell with total scaling constant formula_85 and radius formula_86 is also a Yukawa potential, but in general the scaling contstant for the equivalent point source is larger than for the shell. More specifically, the potential of a point with scaling constant formula_2 outside of the shell is
:formula_88
which is the same as replacing the shell with a point source with magnitude formula_89.
The interior potential is
:formula_90
If formula_91, then one recovers the shell theorem for the inverse square potential.

A consequence of this is that in modified gravity theories where the graviton has nonzero mass, the weak equivalence principle would be violated and the gravitational acceleration of a body in free fall would depend on its composition.

<text>The Instituto Nacional de Estatística or INE (Portuguese for &#x27;National Institute for Statistics&#x27;) is the government office for national statistics of Portugal. In the English language it is also branded as Statistics Portugal.

The INE is one of the components of the Portuguese National Statistical System (SEN), which also includes the Higher Council of Statistics, the Bank of Portugal and the regional statistical services the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira.

It was established in 1935, as the successor of the (&#x27;Directorate-General for Statistics&#x27;) which had been created in 1896.

The first population census known to be done in which is the Portugal of today was done in the year 1 AD by order of the Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus, covering the province of Lusitania. After the foundation of the independent Portugal, many census were done, one of the first relevant known being the Roll of the Crossbowmen done in the 13th century by order of King Afonso III.

The first modern census in Portugal, done accordingly with the scientific methodology established by the First International Statistical Congress, was carried out in 1864. A national census takes place every 10 years, the last one being carried away in 2011 and the next one to be carried away in 2021.

The INE publishes the REVSTAT - Statistical Journal.

The name &quot;Instituto Nacional de Estatística&quot; and the corresponding acronym &quot;INE&quot; is also used as the designation of the central statistical services of several other countries of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, like those of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and São Tomé and Príncipe.

==INE&#x27;s headquarters==
INE is installed in an Art Deco building, designed specifically to serve as its headquarters by architect Porfírio Pardal Monteiro in 1931. The building started to be being built in 1932, being inaugurated in 1935. Being a landmark of the early 20th century Portuguese modern architecture, INE&#x27;s headquarters was classified as a public interest monument in 2013.

<doc id="502813" wikidata="Q7876692" url="?curid=502813" title="Uchen script">
<text>Uchen (; ; variant spellings include &quot;ucen&quot;, &quot;u-cen&quot;, &quot;u-chen&quot;, &quot;ucan&quot;, &quot;u-can&quot;, &quot;uchan&quot;, &quot;u-chan&quot;, and &quot;ucän&quot;) is the upright, block style of the Tibetan script. The name means &quot;with a head&quot;, and is the style of the script used for printing and for formal manuscripts.

It is used to write both the Tibetan language and Dzongkha, the official language of Bhutan.

There are also a number of cursive forms of the Tibetan script, sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;umê&quot; (), &quot;headless.&quot;

== Origin ==
Uchen script is a written Tibetan script that uses alphabetic characters to physically record the spoken languages of Tibet and Bhutan. Uchen script emerged in between the seventh and early eighth century, alongside the formation and development of the Tibetan Empire. The script originally was created in Tibet but was also adopted in the neighbouring country of Bhutan located in East Asia. Historians believe the script was created by the seventh century scribe and academic Thonmi Sambhota&quot;.&quot; The creation of the script was undertaken by Thonmi Sambhota in the reign of Songtsen Gampo under the king&#x27;s instructions. The subsequent implementation of Uchen script, under the reign of Songtsen Gampo has been credited to have aided in improving the Tibetan economy, trade and foreign relations of the period. This improvement in economy and foreign relations elevated Tibet rapport with surrounding countries. This set Tibet on the trajectory to gain greater power in South East Asia and establish itself as a successful and growing Empire. These elevations largely can be credited to Uchen script, as the implementation of a centralised script for countries and regions can be both a unifying and money acquiring tool.

Uchen script was also heavily influenced by Indian written scripts of the period, namely Brahmi scripts. This direct influence of India and link between the two writing systems was also useful as it connected Tibet with India&#x27;s power. This aided Tibet in securing highly valuable connections between the two nations. As India was the most powerful country in the region at the time it made a powerful ally and example for Tibet. As Uchen script is based on Indic- Brahmi scripts of the time period, it shares certain visual features. These include the use of long straight and curved characters that &#x27;stack&#x27; to create syllables.

Uchen script was formulated by Thonmi Sambhota. Sambhota formulated the script after being sent to India to study script making. After being taught by, and observing expert Indian scribes and script makers he designed Uchen script. Sambhota used variations of these Indian and Brahmi scripts to create a script unique to Tibet and Bhutan. The purpose of Uchen script was to document the Tibetan language and the language of Bhutan; Dzongkha. The use of the script served many functions. These functions include; documenting key events, the recording of religious scriptures and the recording of poetry and texts of cultural significance. These examples of written Uchen script have been found in the form of stone and wood carvings, as well as manuscripts written in ink onto paper.

== Style ==

The Tibetan script is based on Indic-Brahmi scripts of the time; that is the alphabets and scripts emerging from India. In form, the script includes thirty consonant, and vowel variants which are written above or below the consonant. In style it is written horizontally left to right and is semi-syllabic when read aloud. These letters can be stacked in order to create a syllable, or small group of letters, that is a section of the full word.

Tibetan and Bhutan written scripts that use the Tibetan language, have been grouped into two categories.

# The first category being the Uchen script. The word Uchen translates to &#x27;with a head&#x27;, this refers to the elongated letters of the alphabet, that are tall and block like with linear strokes. Uchen script is the formal, upright and block style that is visually larger and less widely used amongst the civilians of Tibet and Bhutan. Uchen script, as opposed to Umê script, is believed to have been used as a formal script, to be used to record important documents and events and most probably used by more educated members of Tibetan society of the period. 
# The second category of Tibetan scripts are the cursive, less formal styles of writing the Tibetan script. These styles are grouped into the name Umê script meaning the &#x27;headless&#x27; script. The translation of &#x27;headless&#x27; refers to their lack of &#x27;headed&#x27; elongated letters, the lack of such, making it an easier script to learn and simpler to write. Their form is a variant on Uchen script. The letters of the alphabet are visually shorter, less block like in form, and more slanted following the scribes movement of hand. Some styles of Umê include local variants in style, a cursive style and a style simplified for children to learn. Therefore Umê script has more of a short and slanted form, using the same alphabet and basic shape and line structure as Uchen script, but having variants in typography and form.

== Function ==
Uchen script, as all written scripts, fulfils its main function to record spoken language. Early Uchen manuscripts are attributed to have been recording proceedings of the kings, emperors and of matters of the court. These inscriptions were carved into stone, and wood. Other manuscripts attributed to have been created for the king and emperors of the seventh to tenth centuries include poetry dedicated to the king and recordings of key moments of the reign. Early examples of Uchen script were influenced strongly by Tibetan Buddhism. This is due to the fact that many examples of written Uchen script were scribed by Buddhist monks to write and record religious documents. Uchen was also used to record official proceedings including legal matters, formal agreements and treaties. Most of these types of carvings were found in central Tibet, and are key artefacts in recording of the Tibetan emperors Khri Srong Ide Brstan c. 756-797 and Khri Lde Srong Brtsan c.800-815. Uchen script has also been located on documents found from a &#x27;cave library&#x27; at Dunhuang that are histories and semi historical texts, giving key insights into cultural Tibetan life in the 9th century. The broad range of texts and the number of themes addressed show that Uchen script was used in order to record a broad range of activities and events deemed culturally important by the commissioner. One notable example of a functioning carving of Uchen script is a wooden block, with the carven Uchen alphabet used for printing ink onto parchment and paper. It is believed that this method of woodblock printing was used in order to print and replicate Uchen letters in an authentic way, and allow for less variation in script writing.

Uchen script writing is not an alphabet widely practiced in the twenty first century. The styles can be found and replicated as they have been recorded in calligraphy manuals. These alphabets and forms use a later variant of the original script, not the ancient Uchen alphabet. 

== Calligraphy and tools ==
Early Uchen script is believed to have been carved into wooden slabs. Though some evidence of these wooden carvings have been found by archaeologists and interpreted by historians, the majority of these artefacts have not been found but rather, over time have been eroded and lost. The earliest surviving examples of the written script are dated to have been made 100 years after the initial creation of the writing system. These artefacts have been dated to have been created between the 8th and 9th centuries. Whilst the script was originally created in between the seventh and eighth century. These examples of Uchen script carvings are carved into rock faces and pillars. Sources and artefacts made of rock and marble having lasted longer as they do not erode or rot over time. Thus while there is lesser evidence of Uchen script inscribed on wooden surfaces, it is likely they existed but were not able to survive as long as the later stone inscriptions.

The creation of the Uchen inscription on stone surfaces was most likely achieved with stone tools, resembling early hammers and chisels, as these were the common tools of the time, that were used in surrounding counties including India. As Uchen script of Tibet is influenced heavily by early Indian script writing, inferences have been made that, similar to the technique of Indian inscriptions, a scribe would have marked out letters on the stone pillar or slab, and the stone cutter would have carved out the marked letters using the chisel as a sharp end to chip the stone and the hammer to apply force to the chisel.

Wood and paper manuscripts have also been found containing Uchen script. The creation dates of these sources span from the middle of the eighth to the end of the tenth century. Historians believe the wooden carved manuscripts would have used similar tools to that of the stone carvings; in that variations of stone chisels and hammers would have been used to carve out the letters in wood. Paper manuscripts dated to the same period used ink applied to parchment or paper with a brush or quill, instead of using chisel and a stone to record Uchen script. This change in technique and tools creates a notable change in form of the script, as ink and paper recordings were faster and easier to create. The script&#x27;s form on paper manuscripts has less rigid lines and has a more of a slanted typography. This, in combination with the script writer&#x27;s agency and human error, has led to variants in form that can be observed in early paper and ink Uchen documents and a more widespread uptake of Umê script over the formal Uchen.

== Key influences ==

The written languages of Asia had heavy influence on Uchen script in its creation, its style and its function. Due to the Uchen script being a Brahmi script, a written script developed between in the 7th and 8th century, Uchen has many influences from surrounding areas and groups of people at the time. As Tibet was a new empire, the king, Songtsen Gampo, endeavoured to establish Tibet as a major power. He commissioned Thonmi Sambhota to create a script for Tibet and Bhutan, and in doing so wished to emulate the power of surrounding successful nations like India. India already had an established and successfully implemented written script. This allowed for India to be able to secure internal events and unification, as well as develop foreign relations and trade. Songtsen Gampo wanted his nation of Tibet to gain the same success as India. Thus, in commissioning Thonmi Sambhota to create a written script, he wanted the script to resemble Indian scripts. Thonmi Sambhota was sent to study scriptwriting under the guidance of expert Indian scribes. The creation of Uchen script therefore shares certain stylistic and aesthetic similarities to Brahami Indian scripts. One such similarity is the elongated lower section of characters.

Written language and written scripts in general can be said to have their roots in texts written in what is now called the Middle East, which encompasses parts of Western Asia. One such written language that emerged from West Asia is Sumerian Cuneiform, the earliest documented writing system, which has been dated by historians to be from the Bronze Age. it is stylistically basic, using simple lines to create semi-realistic images to record language, such as depictions of animals. This use of lines eventually developed away from realistic drawings into symbols and alphabets that utilized a more abstract use of lines to represent meanings. Thus, Sumerian Cuneiform was the basis in which written language developed, and it influenced the Uchen script in its use of lines and abstract shapes that can be deciphered into words.

Some of the proceeding earliest written scripts developed some time after Sumerian cuneiform are scripts attributed to Old Chinese. These scripts have been recorded on stone and marble and are written in Old Chinese. These scripts were less pictographic and more abstract in their depiction of the languages through letters and lines. Old Chinese writing was used to record poetry and important historical events. Uchen mirrors this use of alphabet in similarly being a tool for recording culturally significant stories poems and events, whilst using less pictographic letters.

<text>John Harris (c. 1666 – 7 September 1719) was an English writer, scientist, and Anglican priest. He is best known as the editor of the &quot;Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot; (1704), the earliest of the English encyclopaedias; as the compiler of the &quot;Complete Collection of Voyages and Travels&quot; (1744), published under his name; and as the author of an unfinished county history of Kent.

==Life==

Harris was born about 1666, probably in Shropshire, and was a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, from 1684 to 1688. He was presented to the vicarage of Icklesham in Sussex, and subsequently to the rectory of St Thomas, Winchelsea. In 1696 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and published a paper in the Society&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; on microscope observations of animalcula which included the very first description of a bdelloid rotifer.

In 1698 he gave the seventh series of the Boyle Lectures, &quot;Atheistical Objections against the Being of God and His Attributes fairly considered and fully refuted&quot;.

Between 1702 and 1704 he delivered at the Marine Coffee House in Birchin Lane, London, the mathematical lectures founded by Sir Charles Cox, and advertised himself as a mathematical tutor at Amen Corner. The friendship of Sir William Cowper secured for him the office of private chaplain, a prebend in Rochester Cathedral (1708), and the rectory of the united London parishes of St Mildred, Bread Street and St Margaret Moses, as well as other preferments.

In politics he showed himself a Whig, and engaged in a bitter quarrel with the Rev. Charles Humphreys, who afterwards was chaplain to the High-Church Tory Henry Sacheverell.

Harris for a time acted as vice-president of the Royal Society. At his death, he was completing an elaborate &quot;History of Kent in Five Parts&quot; of which the first volume only was published, by D. Midwinter of St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, London, in 1719. He is said to have died in poverty brought on by his own bad management of his affairs.

<text>The Pagasetic Gulf () is a rounded gulf (max. depth 102 metres) in the Magnesia regional unit (east central Greece) that is formed by the Mount Pelion peninsula. It is connected with the Euboic Sea. The passage into the Euboic Sea is narrow and is about 4 km.

Its main port is Volos.

==Mythology and history==
The gulf is named after its historic major port, Pagasae, from which mythology says that Jason built his ship the &quot;Argo&quot; and from which he sailed on his adventurous voyage.

The gulf&#x27;s name in Latin was &quot;Pagasaeus Sinus&quot;.

<text>A thermal reservoir, also thermal energy reservoir or thermal bath, is a thermodynamic system with a heat capacity so large that the temperature of the reservoir changes relatively little when a significant amount of heat is added or extracted. As a conceptual simplification, it effectively functions as an infinite pool of thermal energy at a given, constant temperature. Since it can act as an inertial source and sink of heat, it is often also referred to as a heat reservoir or heat bath. 

Lakes, oceans and rivers often serve as thermal reservoirs in geophysical processes, such as the weather. In atmospheric science, large air masses in the atmosphere often function as thermal reservoirs.

Since the temperature of a thermal reservoir does not change during the heat transfer, the change of entropy in the reservoir is
formula_1

The microcanonical partition sum formula_2 of a heat bath of temperature has the property
formula_3
where formula_4 is the Boltzmann constant. It thus changes by the same factor when a given amount of energy is added. The exponential factor in this expression can be identified with the reciprocal of the Boltzmann factor.

For an engineering application, see geothermal heat pump.

<text>Charles Louis Fefferman (born April 18, 1949) is an American mathematician at Princeton University, where he is currently the Herbert E. Jones, Jr. &#x27;43 University Professor of Mathematics. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1978 for his contributions to mathematical analysis.

==Early life and education==
Fefferman was born to a Jewish family, in Washington, DC. He was a child prodigy, entered the University of Maryland at age 14, and had written his first scientific paper by the age of 15. He graduated with degrees in math and physics at 17, and earned his PhD in mathematics three years later from Princeton University, under Elias Stein. His doctoral dissertation was titled &quot;Inequalities for strongly singular convolution operators&quot;. Fefferman achieved a full professorship at the University of Chicago at the age of 22, making him the youngest full professor ever appointed in the United States.

==Career==
At the age of 25, he returned to Princeton as a full professor, becoming the youngest person to be promoted to the title. He won the Alan T. Waterman Award in 1976 (the first person to get the award) and the Fields Medal in 1978 for his work in mathematical analysis, specifically convergence and divergence. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1979. He was appointed the Herbert Jones Professor at Princeton in 1984.

In addition to the above, his honors include the Salem Prize in 1971, the Bergman Prize in 1992, the Bôcher Memorial Prize in 2008, and the Wolf Prize in Mathematics for 2017, as well as election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. In 2021 he was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.

Fefferman contributed several innovations that revised the study of multidimensional complex analysis by finding fruitful generalisations of classical low-dimensional results. Fefferman&#x27;s work on partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, in particular convergence, multipliers, divergence, singular integrals and Hardy spaces earned him a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Helsinki in 1978. He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1974 in Vancouver.

His early work included a study of the asymptotics of the Bergman kernel off the boundaries of pseudoconvex domains in formula_1. He has studied mathematical physics, harmonic analysis, fluid dynamics, neural networks, geometry, mathematical finance and spectral analysis, amongst others.

==Family==
Charles Fefferman and his wife Julie have two daughters, Nina and Lainie. Lainie Fefferman is a composer, taught math at Saint Ann&#x27;s School and holds a degree in music from Yale University as well as a Ph.D. in music composition from Princeton. She has an interest in Middle Eastern music. Nina Fefferman is a computational biologist residing at the University of Tennessee whose research is concerned with the application of mathematical models to complex biological systems. Charles Fefferman&#x27;s brother, Robert Fefferman, is also a mathematician and former Dean of the Physical Sciences Division at the University of Chicago.

<text>Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai), also known as the bumblebee bat, is a near-threatened species of bat and the only extant member of the family Craseonycteridae. It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Myanmar, where it occupies limestone caves along rivers.

Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat is the smallest species of bat and arguably the world&#x27;s smallest mammal by body length (the Etruscan shrew is regarded as the smallest by body mass). It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies range greatly in size, with an average of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females give birth annually to a single offspring.

Although the bat&#x27;s status in Myanmar is not well known, the Thai population is restricted to a single province and may be at risk of extinction. Its potential threats are primarily anthropogenic, and include habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites.

==Description==

Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat is small at about in length and in mass, hence the common name of &quot;bumblebee bat&quot;. It is the smallest species of bat and may be the world&#x27;s smallest mammal, depending on how size is defined. The main competitors for the title are small shrews; in particular, the Etruscan shrew may be lighter at but its body is longer, measuring from its head to the base of the tail.

The bat has a distinctive swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur. In the jaw, the premaxillae are not fused with surrounding bones, and the coronoid process is significantly reduced. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.

The bat&#x27;s upperparts are reddish-brown or grey, while the underside is generally paler. The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips that allow the bat to hover. The second digit of the wing is made of a single short phalanx. And the humerus has an increased number of locking tubercles on its head and beyond. There is a considerable fusion in the axial skeleton, concerning the thoracic (three posterior vertebrae), lumbar (two posterior) and sacral (all) sections. The bat has particularly slender legs, with rather thin fibula. Despite having two caudal vertebrae, Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying and catching insects, although there are no tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight.

==Range, habitat and diversity==
Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat occupies limestone caves along rivers within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. In Thailand, it is restricted to a small region of the Tenasserim Hills in Sai Yok District, Kanchanaburi Province, within the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River. While Sai Yok National Park in the Dawna Hills contains much of the bat&#x27;s range, some Thai populations occur outside the park and are therefore unprotected.

Since the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Myanmar, at least nine separate sites have been identified in the limestone outcrops of the Dawna and Karen Hills outside the Thanlwin, Ataran, and Gyaing Rivers of Kayin and Mon States. The Thai and Myanmar populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation calls are distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.

Despite its restricted geographical range and specialized habitat requirements, Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat exhibits remarkable genetic diversity within its populations. Molecular analyses using microsatellite markers have revealed moderate levels of genetic differentiation among cave roosts in Thailand and Myanmar, suggesting historical isolation and limited gene flow between populations. 

== Biology and reproductive structure ==
Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat roosts in caves in limestone hills, far from the entrance. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.

Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat has a brief activity period, leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat&#x27;s diet include small flies (Chloropidae, Agromyzidae, and Anthomyiidae), hymenopterans, and psocopterans.

Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat suggest a unique reproductive strategy characteristic of microchiropterans. Females of this species typically give birth to a single offspring per reproductive event, with births occurring during the dry season between March and May. Maternity colonies composed of a small number of females are formed within cave roosts, providing communal protection and thermoregulatory benefits for nursing offspring. Male mating behaviors, such as courtship vocalizations and scent marking, have been documented in captive populations, indicating potential sexual selection mechanisms.

==Taxonomy ==
Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat is the only extant species in the family Craseonycteridae, which is grouped in the superfamily Rhinolophoidea as a result of molecular testing. Based on this determination, the bat&#x27;s closest relatives are members of the families Hipposideridae and Rhinopomatidae.

Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat was unknown to the world at large prior to 1974. Its common name refers to its discoverer, Thai zoologist Kitti Thonglongya. Thonglongya worked with a British partner, John E. Hill, in classifying bats of Thailand; after Thonglongya died suddenly in February 1974, Hill formally described the species, giving it the binomial name &quot;Craseonycteris thonglongyai&quot; in honour of his colleague.

==Ecological role and conservation==
As a microchiropteran species, Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat plays a crucial ecological role in its habitat, primarily as an insectivore. This species preys predominantly on small flying insects, including mosquitoes, moths, and beetles. By controlling insect populations, particularly those of agricultural pests and disease vectors, Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat contributes to ecosystem balance and human well-being. Furthermore, its presence in cave ecosystems may also influence nutrient cycling and the distribution of guano-dependent organisms.

As of the species&#x27; review in 2019, Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat is listed by the IUCN as near-threatened, with a downward population trend.

Soon after the bat&#x27;s discovery in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed as a result of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs. However, these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.

Currently, the most significant and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat&#x27;s breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a gas pipeline from Myanmar to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Myanmar population are not well known.

In 2007, Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat was identified by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered project as one of its Top 10 &quot;focal species&quot;.

<text>This list contains weapons that are classified as crew-served, as the term is used in the United States military.

While the general understanding is that crew-served weapons require more than one person to operate them, there are important exceptions in the case of both squad automatic weapons (SAW) and sniper rifles. Within the table of organization and equipment for both the United States Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, these two classes of weapons are understood to be crew-served, as the operator of the weapon has an assistant, who carries additional ammunition and associated equipment, acts as a spotter, and is also fully qualified in the operation of the weapon.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (1605–1689) was a 17th-century French gem merchant and traveler. Tavernier, a private individual and merchant traveling at his own expense, covered, by his own account, 60,000 leagues in making six voyages to Persia and India between the years 1630 and 1668. In 1675, Tavernier, at the behest of his patron Louis XIV, known as the Sun King, published &quot;Les Six Voyages de Jean-Baptiste Tavernier&quot; (&quot;Six Voyages&quot;, 1676).

Tavernier is best known for his 1666 discovery or purchase of the 116-carat Tavernier Blue diamond that he subsequently sold to Louis XIV of France in 1668 for 120,000 livres, the equivalent of 172,000 ounces of pure gold, and a letter of ennoblement.

In 1669, Tavernier purchased for 60,000 livres the Seigneury (fief) of Aubonne, located in the Duchy of Savoy near the city of Geneva, and became Baron of Aubonne.

Tavernier&#x27;s writings show that he was a keen observer, as well as a remarkable cultural anthropologist. His &quot;Six Voyages&quot; became a best seller and was translated into German, Dutch, Italian, and English during his lifetime. The work is frequently quoted by modern scholars writing about the period.

==Early life==
Tavernier was born in Paris of a French or Flemish Huguenot family that had emigrated to Antwerp to escape persecution; they subsequently returned to Paris after the publication of the Edict of Nantes, which promised protection for French Protestants. Both his father Gabriel and his brother Melchior Tavernier were cartographers, and it is clear from the accuracy of his drawings that Tavernier received some instruction in the art of cartography and engraving.

The conversations he heard in his father&#x27;s house inspired Tavernier with an early desire to travel, and by his sixteenth year he had already visited England, the Low Countries and Germany.

In 1624, at eighteen, Tavernier took service with the Viceroy of Hungary. By 1629, after four and a half years, he had grown restless. At the invitation of the young Duke of Rethel, to whom he had previously been briefly attached as a guide and translator, Tavernier traveled to Mantua and took service as an ensign of artillery under the duke&#x27;s father, the Duke of Nevers, who was besieging the city. In the following year Tavernier traveled, as a translator, with an Irish mercenary in the service of the emperor, Colonel Walter Butler (afterwards notorious for killing Albrecht von Wallenstein).

In the &quot;Six Voyages&quot;, Tavernier states that he departed from Butler&#x27;s company, in 1630, with the intention of traveling to Ratisbon (Regensburg), to attend the investiture of the son of Emperor Ferdinand II as King of the Romans. However, as the investiture did not take place until 1636, it is probable that he attended the ceremony between his first and second voyages. By his own account, he had seen Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, and Hungary, as well as France, England and the Low Countries, and spoke the principal languages of these countries.

==First journey==
Tavernier was now eager to visit the East. At Ratisbon – with the help of Pere Joseph, Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s agent and &quot;éminence grise&quot; –Tavernier was able to join the retinue of a pair of French travellers, M. de Chapes and M. de St. Liebau, who had received a mission to go to the Levant. In their company he reached Constantinople early in 1631, where he spent eleven months, and then proceeded by Tokat, Erzerum, and Erivan to Safavid Persia. His farthest point in this first journey was the Persian city of Isfahan. He returned by Baghdad, Aleppo, Alexandretta, Malta, and Italy, and was again in Paris in 1633.

Of the next five years of Tavernier&#x27;s life, nothing is known with certainty. However, Joret, his French biographer, claims that during this period he may have become controller of the household of Gaston, Duke of Orléans. We do know that twice during his &quot;Six Voyages&quot; he claimed the Duke&#x27;s patronage.

==Second journey==

In September 1638, Tavernier began a second journey. This journey lasted until 1643; during this expedition, he traveled via Aleppo to Persia, thence to India as far as Agra, and from there to the Kingdom of Golconda. He visited the court of the Mughal—Emperor Shah Jahan—and made his first trip to the diamond mines.

==Later voyages==

The second journey was followed by four others. In these later voyages, Tavernier traveled as a merchant of the highest rank, trading in costly jewels and other precious wares, and finding his chief customers among the greatest princes of the East.

On his third journey (1643–49), he went as far as Java, and returned by the Cape. His relations with the Dutch proved not wholly satisfactory, and a long lawsuit on his return yielded but imperfect redress.

A fourth voyage (1651–55) took Tavernier to Alexandretta, Aleppo, Basra (where he reported on the Mandaeans, which he referred to as the &quot;Christians of St. John&quot;), Persian Bandar Abbas, Masulipatam, Gandikot, Golkonda, Surat, Ahmedabad, Pegu, Dagon, Ava, Mogok, back to Bandar Abbas and Isfahan, thence back to Paris.

During his last two voyages, his fifth and sixth (1657–1662, 1664–1668), he did not proceed beyond India. The details of these voyages are often obscure; they nevertheless added to an extraordinary knowledge of overland Eastern trade routes and brought the now famous merchant into close and friendly communication with the greatest Oriental potentates.

These last voyages also secured for him a large fortune and great reputation at home. He was presented to Louis XIV, in whose service he had travelled sixty thousand leagues by land. In 1662, Tavernier married Madeleine Goisse, daughter of a Parisian jeweller. He received patents of nobility on 16 February 1669; in the following year purchased, for 60,000 livres, the Seigneury of Aubonne, located in the Duchy of Savoy, near Geneva.

==Writings==
Thus settled in ease and affluence, Tavernier occupied himself, it would seem at the desire of the king, in publishing an account of his journeys. He had neither the equipment nor the tastes of a scientific traveller, but in all that referred to commerce his knowledge was vast and could not fail to be of much public service. He set to work therefore with the aid of Samuel Chappuzeau, a French Protestant &quot;littérateur&quot;, and produced &quot;Nouvelle Relation de l&#x27;Intérieur du Sérail du Grand Seigneur&quot; (4to, Paris, 1675), based on the two visits to Constantinople on his first and sixth journeys.

That book was followed by &quot;Les Six Voyages de J. B. Tavernier&quot; (2 vols. 4to, Paris, 1676) and by a supplementary &quot;Recueil de Plusieurs Relations&quot; (4to, Paris, 1679), in which he was assisted by a certain La Chapelle. This last contains an account of Japan, gathered from merchants and others, and one of Tongking, derived from the observations of his brother Daniel, who had shared his second voyage and settled at Batavia; and it also contains a violent attack on the agents of the Dutch East India Company, at whose hands Tavernier had suffered more than one wrong. This attack was elaborately answered in Dutch by H. van Quellenburgh (&quot;Vindictie Batavicae&quot;, Amsterdam, 1684), but made more noise because Antoine Arnauld drew from it some material unfavorable to Protestantism for his &quot;Apologie pour les Catholiques&quot; (1681), and so brought Tavernier a ferocious onslaught in Pierre Jurieu&#x27;s &quot;Esprit de M. Arnauld&quot; (1684). Tavernier made no reply to Jurieu.
This work is much prized by historians and geographers for its detailed accounts of the places visited by Tavernier, from 1631 to 1668, and his dealings with politically important persons at a time when reliable reports from the Near East and the Orient were scanty or lacking altogether. Doubt has been cast on Tavernier&#x27;s accuracy, but ...insofar as gemological information is concerned, Tavernier&#x27;s observations have also withstood the test of time and are considered reliable.
==Later years and death==

The closing years of Tavernier&#x27;s life are not well documented; the times were not favorable for a Protestant in France. In 1684, Tavernier traveled to Brandenburg at the request of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, to discuss the elector&#x27;s scheme to charter his own East India Company. The elector wished Tavernier to become his ambassador to India. He awarded Tavernier the honorary posts of Chamberlain and Counselor of Marine. The scheme, unfortunately, came to nothing.

In 1679, Louis XIV began to seriously undermine his Protestant subjects. He established the Bureau of Conversion to reward Catholic converts. In January 1685, Tavernier managed to sell his Château Aubonne to Marquis Henri du Quesne for 138,000 livres plus 3,000 livres for horses and carriages. Tavernier&#x27;s timing was good: in October of the same year, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes. Louis then instituted the Verification of Nobility which deprived those Protestant noblemen who refused to convert to Catholicism of their titles. Tavernier was technically a subject of the Duke of Savoy, but Louis threatened to invade the duchy, if the duke, his son-in-law, did not follow his lead.

In 1687, despite an edict prohibiting Protestants from leaving France, Tavernier left Paris and traveled to Switzerland. In 1689, he passed through Berlin and Copenhagen and entered Russia on a passport issued by the king of Sweden, and a visa signed by the Czar&#x27;s First Minister, Prince Andrea Gallatin, perhaps with the intent of traveling overland to India. It is not known if he met with Czar Peter who was just 17 years old at that time. What is known is that Tavernier, as with all foreigners resident in Moscow, would have been required, by imperial decree, to take up residence in the foreign quarter, known as the German Suburb (Nemetskaya Sloboda). Peter was very interested in all things foreign, had many friends in the suburb, and spent a great deal of time there, beginning in mid-March 1689. Tavernier arrived in Moscow in late February or early March of that year. Tavernier was a famous man. Given Peter&#x27;s obsession with all things European, it would be surprising if they did not meet.

Tavernier died in Moscow in 1689, at the age of eighty-four. Tavernier was the model of the inveterate traveler, as well as the most consequential diamond dealer of his age. His remarkable three-hundred-year-old book (Le Six Voyages...1677) tells the stories of many significant gems that remain in the public mind today.
Tavernier&#x27;s biographer Charles Joret, produced a fragment of an article published in a Danish journal by Frederick Rostgaard, who states that he interviewed the aging adventurer and was told of his intention to travel to Persia via Moscow. Tavernier was not, however, able to complete this last journey.

==Legacy==
Tavernier&#x27;s travels, though often reprinted and translated, have a defect for his biographer: the chronology is much confused by his plan of combining notes from various journeys about certain routes, for he sought mainly to furnish a guide to other merchants. A careful attempt to disentangle the thread of a life still in many parts obscure was made by Charles Joret, in &quot;Jean-Baptiste Tavernier d&#x27;aprés des Documents Nouveaux&quot;, 8vo, Paris, 1886, where the literature of the subject is fully given. See also the second English translation of Tavernier&#x27;s account of his travels, so far as relating to India, by Valentine Ball, 2 vols. (1889). Subsequently, a definitive 2nd edition of Ball&#x27;s translation, edited by William Crooke was published in 1925. Some consider Tavernier&#x27;s accounts unreliable.

Tavernier was the subject of an English film, &quot;The Diamond Queen&quot; (1953) by John Brahm.

The &quot;In Search of...&quot; episode &quot;The Diamond Curse&quot; repeats a persistent myth that Tavernier was torn apart by wild dogs because of the curse of a blue diamond (subsequently called the Hope Diamond) he had allegedly acquired through deception and murder.

For the 400th anniversary of Tavernier&#x27;s birth in 2005, the Swiss filmmaker Philippe Nicolet made a full-length film about him called &quot;Les voyages en Orient du Baron d&#x27;Aubonne&quot;. Another Swiss, the sculptor Jacques Basler, made a life-sized bronze effigy of the great 17th-century traveller which looks out over Lake Geneva at the Hotel Baron Tavernier, where there is also a permanent exhibition of all his drawings and archives in Chexbres.

Using Tavernier&#x27;s &quot;Les Six Voyages&quot; as a template, gemologist/historian Richard W. Wise wrote an award-winning historical novel, &quot;The French Blue&quot;, that dramatizes Tavernier&#x27;s life and voyages up until the sale of The Great Blue Diamond to Louis XIV. The book&#x27;s website includes a detailed timeline of Tavernier&#x27;s life and voyages. (In 1671, Louis had his court jeweler Jean Pitau recut the stone into the 68 carat French Blue and had it set as a hatpin. The gem was reset by his great-grandson Louis XV in The Medal of The Order of the Golden Fleece, stolen in 1792, recut, and re-emerged in London 30 years later as the Hope Diamond.)

He was one of country music&#x27;s most popular and influential performers of the 1970s and 1980s. Nearly completely blind from birth, he became one of the most successful and versatile country &quot;crossover&quot; singers of his time, appealing to both country and pop music markets with hit songs that incorporated pop, R&amp;B, and rock and roll elements. His biggest crossover hits include &quot;It Was Almost Like a Song&quot;, &quot;Smoky Mountain Rain&quot;, &quot;(There&#x27;s) No Gettin&#x27; Over Me&quot;, &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Have Missed It for the World&quot;, &quot;Any Day Now&quot;, and &quot;Stranger in My House&quot;. He is credited with six Grammy Awards and 35 number-one country hits, fourth to George Strait, Conway Twitty, and Merle Haggard. He was selected for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Career==
===Early life (1943–1971)===
Milsap was born January 16, 1943, in Robbinsville, North Carolina. A congenital disorder left him almost completely blind from birth. Abandoned by his mother as an infant, he was raised in poverty by his grandparents in the Smoky Mountains until he was sent to the North Carolina State School for the Blind and Deaf in Raleigh, North Carolina, at age five.

During his childhood, Milsap developed a passion for music, particularly the late-night radio broadcasts of country music, gospel music, and rhythm and blues. When he was 7, his instructors noticed his musical talents. Soon afterward he began formal study of classical music at Governor Morehead School and learned several instruments, eventually mastering the piano. 

When he was 14, a slap from one of the school&#x27;s houseparents caused him to lose what very limited vision he had in his left eye.

With the national breakthrough of Elvis Presley in 1956, Milsap became interested in rock and roll music and formed a rock band called the Apparitions with fellow high-school students. In concert, Milsap has often paid tribute to the musicians of the 1950s who inspired him including Ray Charles, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Presley.

Milsap was awarded a full college scholarship and briefly attended Young Harris College in Young Harris, Georgia, with plans to become a lawyer. During this time, Milsap joined a popular local R&amp;B band called the Dimensions that played gigs in the Atlanta area, and became a regular attraction at the rough and rowdy Royal Peacock Club. In the fall of 1964, Milsap declined a scholarship to law school and left college to pursue a full-time career in music. He met Joyce Reeves one night at a dinner party during this period, after which the two were married in 1965.

In 1963, Milsap met Atlanta disc jockey Pat Hughes, who became an early supporter of his music career. Milsap recorded his first single, &quot;Total Disaster/It Went to Your Head&quot;, which enjoyed some local success in the Atlanta area. The single sold 15,000 copies with the help of Hughes, who played the record on his radio show. Around this same time, Milsap auditioned for a job as a keyboardist for musician J. J. Cale. In 1965, Milsap signed with New York–based Scepter Records, recording several obscure singles for the label over the next few years, and working briefly with other soul musicians like Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder.

Also in 1965, Milsap scored his first hit with the Ashford &amp; Simpson–penned single, &quot;Never Had It So Good&quot;, which peaked at No. 19 on the R&amp;B chart in November of that year. It would be his only successful single during his time with Scepter. Milsap cut another Ashford &amp; Simpson tune, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Get Stoned&quot;, that was relegated to a B-side.

In the late 1960s, after moving to Memphis, Tennessee, Milsap worked for producer Chips Moman and became a popular weekly attraction at the Memphis nightclub T.J.&#x27;s. During this time, Moman helped Milsap land work as a session musician on numerous projects including several recordings with Elvis Presley such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Daddy&quot; in 1969 and &quot;Kentucky Rain&quot; in 1970. That same year, Milsap made the lower reaches of the pop charts with the single &quot;Loving You Is a Natural Thing&quot;. He recorded and released his debut album, &quot;Ronnie Milsap&quot;, on Warner Brothers in 1971.

===Breakthrough success (1973–1975)===

In December 1972, Milsap relocated to Nashville after a chance meeting with country music star Charley Pride who was in the audience for a Milsap gig at the nightclub Whiskey A-Go-Go on Sunset Blvd. in Los Angeles. Pride was impressed with Milsap&#x27;s singing and encouraged him to change course and focus on country music. Milsap began working with Pride&#x27;s manager, Jack D. Johnson, and was signed to RCA Records in 1973. He released his first single for RCA that year, &quot;I Hate You&quot;, which became his first country music success, peaking at No. 10 on the country chart. In 1974, Milsap toured with Pride as an opening act and had two No. 1 singles: &quot;Pure Love&quot; (written by Eddie Rabbitt) and the Kris Kristofferson composition &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Tell Me How the Story Ends&quot; which won Milsap his first Grammy. In 1975, he revived the Don Gibson song &quot;(I&#x27;d Be) A Legend in My Time&quot; and scored another No. 1 hit with &quot;Daydreams About Night Things&quot;.

===&quot;It Was Almost Like a Song&quot; (1976–1978)===
From 1976 to 1978, Milsap became one of country music&#x27;s biggest stars. He scored seven No. 1 singles in a row, including the Grammy-winning &quot;(I&#x27;m a) Stand by My Woman Man&quot; and &quot;What a Difference You&#x27;ve Made in My Life&quot;. The most significant of this series was &quot;It Was Almost Like a Song&quot; in 1977, a piano-based ballad, which became his most successful single of the 1970s. In addition to topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, the song was his first entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop music chart since &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Tell Me How the Story Ends&quot; reached No. 95; &quot;It Was Almost Like a Song,&quot; reached No. 16. It was also his first song to make the Adult Contemporary Chart, stopping at No. 7. While the song was Milsap&#x27;s only crossover success of the 1970s, he continued to achieve hits on the country music charts for the remainder of the decade.

===Crossover success (1979–1992)===
Milsap&#x27;s sound shifted toward string-laden pop ballads during the late 1970s which resulted in crossover success on the pop charts beginning in the early 1980s. From 1980 until 1983, he scored a series of eleven No. 1 singles. Milsap&#x27;s Greatest Hits album, released in 1980, included a new single, &quot;Smoky Mountain Rain&quot;, which became a No. 1 smash on the country charts. The single peaked in the Top 20 on the pop music chart and also became the first of two Milsap songs to score No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

Other crossover successes included the Top 5 pop single, &quot;(There&#x27;s) No Gettin&#x27; Over Me&quot;, and two Top 20 songs in &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Have Missed It For the World&quot; and &quot;Any Day Now&quot;, the latter which lasted five weeks at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart. He also had some success with &quot;He Got You&quot;. All four songs reached No. 1 on the country music charts.

Although the series of No. 1 hits ended in 1983, the last song of the series, &quot;Stranger in My House&quot;, was still successful on all three charts, peaking at No. 5 on the country music chart, No. 23 on the pop music chart, and No. 8 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Just a few months later, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know How Much I Love You&quot; was released, becoming Milsap&#x27;s last significant entry on the pop music chart, stopping at No. 58. However it, along with others, still became major successes on the Adult Contemporary chart. These successful singles include &quot;Show Her&quot;, &quot;Still Losing You&quot;, and finally, the Grammy-winning song &quot;Lost in the Fifties Tonight&quot; (his last pop crossover success) in 1985.

Between 1985 and 1987, Milsap enjoyed a series of uninterrupted No. 1 country singles, enjoying great success at this time with &quot;She Keeps the Home Fires Burning&quot;, &quot;In Love&quot;, &quot;Snap Your Fingers&quot;, &quot;Where Do the Nights Go&quot;, and the Grammy-winning duet with Kenny Rogers, &quot;Make No Mistake, She&#x27;s Mine&quot;. In 1987, Milsap contributed the theme song to the short-lived NBC television series &quot;J.J. Starbuck&quot;.

In 1989, Milsap had his last No. 1 song with &quot;A Woman in Love&quot;, although he still remained successful on the charts. Other Top 10 singles between 1989 and 1991 include &quot;Houston Solution&quot;, &quot;Stranger Things Have Happened&quot;, &quot;Turn That Radio On&quot;, a remake of the 1950s hit &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot; (his last adult contemporary hit) and &quot;Are You Loving Me Like I&#x27;m loving You&quot;. With the help of writer Tom Carter, Milsap wrote and released his autobiography, titled &quot;Almost like a Song&quot;, in 1990.

In 1992, he had a major success with &quot;All Is Fair in Love and War&quot;. The song featured rock guitarist Mark Knopfler on lead guitar and peaked at No. 11; his last top-40 country hit, &quot;True Believer,&quot; peaked in 1993 at No. 30. By that time, however, Milsap&#x27;s chart success began to decline.

===Since 1993: Life today===
Milsap has remained one of country music&#x27;s best-loved and most successful artists despite the lack of radio airplay since the mid-1990s. In 1993, he left RCA for Liberty and released the album &quot;True Believer&quot; which failed to achieve significant radio airplay, although the title song scored No. 30 on the country chart. In 2000, Milsap resurfaced with a two-CD set, &quot;40 No. 1 Hits&quot;, featuring a new single entitled &quot;Time, Love, and Money&quot;.

The project was a collection of American popular/jazz music standards which earned Milsap a Grammy award nomination that year. In 2006, Milsap signed with his former company RCA and returned to a mainstream, contemporary country music style with the album &quot;My Life&quot;. The first single was &quot;Local Girls&quot; which reached No. 54.

<text>Pagasae or Pagases (), also Pagasa, was a town and polis (city-state) of Magnesia in ancient Thessaly, currently a suburb of Volos. It is situated at the northern extremity of the bay named after it (Παγασητικὸς κόλπος, or ).

Pagasae is celebrated in mythology as the port where Jason built the ship &quot;Argo&quot;, and from which he sailed upon his adventurous voyage: hence some of the ancients derived its name from the construction of that vessel, (from πήγνυμι), but others from the numerous and abundant springs which were found at this spot. Apollonius of Rhodes describes the setting vividly in the first book of his &quot;Argonautica&quot;. Pagasae was conquered by Philip II of Macedon after the defeat of Onomarchus; in Diodorus&#x27;s report the place is spelt Παγαί - &quot;Pagaí&quot;. On the foundation of Demetrias in 290 or 293 BCE, Pagasae was one of the towns whose inhabitants were transferred to the new city; but after the Roman conquest Pagasae was restored, and again became an important place. In the time of Strabo it was the port of Pherae, which was the principal city in this part of Thessaly. Pagasae was 90 stadia from Pherae, and 20 from Iolcos.

As of the nineteenth century, the ruins of the ancient city were to be seen near Volos, which has given the modern name to the bay. The acropolis occupied the summit of some rocky heights above Cape Angkístri, and at the foot of the rocks are many copious sources of water, of which Strabo speaks. But as these springs are rather saline to the taste, the city was provided in the Roman times with water from a distance by means of an aqueduct, the ruined piers of which are still a conspicuous object. The accepted site is in the modern village of Nees Pagasees in the municipality of Volos; however, the most recent excavations seem to indicate that Pagasae may be the ruins at nearby Soros, also in the municipality of Volos.

<text>Demetrias () was a Greek city in Magnesia in ancient Thessaly (east central Greece), situated at the head of the Pagasaean Gulf, near the modern city of Volos.

==History==
It was founded in 294 BCE by Demetrius Poliorcetes, who removed thither the inhabitants of Nelia, Pagasae, Ormenium, Rhizus, Sepias, Olizon, Boebe and Iolcos, all of which were afterwards included in the territory of Demetrias. It soon became an important place, and the favourite residence of the Macedonian kings. It was favourably situated for commanding the interior of Thessaly, as well as the neighbouring seas; and such was the importance of its position that it was called by Philip V of Macedon one of the three fetters of Greece, the other two being Chalcis and Corinth.

In 196 BCE, the Romans, victorious in the Battle of Cynoscephalae over Philip V in the previous year, took possession of Demetrias and garrisoned the town. Four years later the Aetolian League captured it by surprise. The Aetolians allied themselves with Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire in the Roman–Seleucid War. This ended in the defeat of Antiochus. After the return of Antiochus to Asia in 191 BCE, Demetrias surrendered to Philip, who was allowed by the Romans to retain possession of the place. It continued in the hands of Philip and his successor till the over-throw of the Macedonian monarchy at the Battle of Pydna, 169 BCE.

During Roman times it lost importance, but it was the capital of the Magnesian League. In Christian times some buildings were built, especially two churches, one in the northern port, called Basilica of Damokratia, and another one to the south of the city, outside the walls, known as the Cemetery Basilica. Under Roman emperor Constantine the Great (ruled 306–337) it became a Christian episcopal see and is now a titular see of the Catholic Church.

According to Procopius (&quot;De Aedificiis&quot;, 4.3.5), Demetrias was rebuilt by Justinian I (r. 527–565), but other evidence points to the possibility that &quot;ancient urban life may have already come to an end by the beginning of the 6th century&quot; (T.E. Gregory). Demetrias is mentioned by Hierocles in the sixth century. Its territory was settled by the Slavic tribe of the Belegezitai in the 7th/8th centuries, raided and sacked by the Saracens in 901/2, and by rebels during the Uprising of Peter Delyan in 1040.

Following the Fourth Crusade, the town was granted to the exiled Byzantine empress Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera, and after her death in 1210 to Margaret of Hungary, the widow of the King of Thessalonica, Boniface of Montferrat. The city came under the rule of Manuel Komnenos Doukas ca. 1240, but was &quot;de facto&quot; controlled by a branch of the Melissenos family. In the 1270s, the Byzantines scored an important victory against the Venetians and the Lombard barons of Euboea at the Battle of Demetrias.

The Catalan Company sacked the town in 1310 and kept it until 1381 at least, but from 1333 on, it began to be abandoned for neighbouring Volos. It was finally captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1393.

==Archaeology==
The site of Demetrias is at a place called Aivaliotika (Αϊβαλιώτικα) in the municipality of Volos.

The ancient town was described by William Martin Leake, who visited the site in the early 19th century, as occupying &quot;the southern or maritime face of a height, now called Gorítza, which projects from the coast of Magnesia, between 2 and 3 miles [3 to 5 km] to the southward of the middle of Volo. Though little more than foundations remains, the inclosure of the city, which was less than 2 miles [3 km] in circumference, is traceable in almost every part. On three sides the walls followed the crest of a declivity which falls steeply to the east and west, as well as towards the sea. To the north the summit of the hill, together with an oblong space below it, formed a small citadel, of which the foundations still subsist. A level space in the middle elevation of the height was conveniently placed for the central part of the city. The acropolis contained a large cistern cut in the rock, which is now partly filled with earth . . . . Many of the ancient streets of the town are traceable in the level which lies midway to the sea, and even the foundations of private houses: the space between one street and the next parallel to it, is little more than 15 feet [5 m]. About the centre of the town is a hollow, now called the lagúmi or mine, where a long rectangular excavation in the rock, 2 feet wide [0.6 m], 7 deep [2.1 m], and covered with flat stones, shows by marks of the action of water in the interior of the channel that it was part of an aqueduct, probably for the purpose of conducting some source in the height upon which stood the citadel, into the middle of the city.&quot;

The site, about 3 km south of Volos, was excavated from the end of the 19th century. Remains of the walls (about 11 km) and the acropolis that was to the northwest in the highest point of the city are preserved. Also uncovered were the theater, the &quot;Heroon&quot; (a temple above the theater), an aqueduct, the sacred agora (with a temple and the administrative center of the city), and the &quot;Anaktoron&quot; (royal palace) east of the city on the top of a hill, which was occupied until the middle of second century BCE, and later used by the Romans as a cemetery.

<text>Carl Emil Schorske (March 15, 1915 – September 13, 2015), known professionally as Carl E. Schorske, was an American cultural historian and professor at Princeton University. In 1981 he won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction for his book &quot;Fin-de-Siècle Vienna: Politics and Culture&quot; (1980), which remains significant to modern European intellectual history. He was a recipient of the first year of MacArthur Fellows Program awards in 1981 and made an honorary citizen of Vienna in 2012.

==Biography==
Born in the Bronx, New York City, to Theodore Schorske and Gertrude Goldsmith, Schorske received his B.A. from Columbia in 1936 and a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1950. He served in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA, during World War II, as chief of political intelligence for Western Europe. His first book, &quot;German Social Democracy&quot;, published by Harvard University Press in 1955, describes the schism of the Social Democratic Party of Germany into a reformist/constitutionalist right faction and a revolutionary oppositionist left faction during the years 1905–1917.

Following his war-time service, Schorske taught at Wesleyan University (1946–1960), the University of California at Berkeley (1960–1969), and Princeton University (1969 until his retirement in 1980), where he was Dayton-Stockton Professor of History. Professor Schorske was named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the nation&#x27;s ten top academic leaders. In 1987 he delivered the Charles Homer Haskins Lecture. In 1998 Schorske published &quot;Thinking With History: Explorations in the Passage to Modernism&quot; (Princeton University Press), a collection of essays on Viennese and general history. He turned 100 in March 2015 and died in September at a retirement community in Hightstown, New Jersey.

==Decorations and awards==
In 2004 Schorske received the Ludwig Wittgenstein Prize of the Austrian Research Association (&quot;Österreichische Forschungsgemeinschaft&quot;). He was a &quot;Corresponding Member&quot; of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. On 25 April 2012 Schorske was made an honorary citizen of Vienna during a ceremony attended by his wife, Elizabeth Rorke, his granddaughter, Carina del Valle Schorske, and the mayor of Vienna, Dr Michael Häupl. In 1981 he was a MacArthur Fellow.

<text>Chip Taylor (born James Wesley Voight; March 21, 1940) is an American songwriter and singer noted for writing &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; and &quot;Wild Thing&quot;.
He is the paternal uncle of actress Angelina Jolie and former actor James Haven. He is the younger brother of actor Jon Voight and geologist Barry Voight.

== Early life ==
Taylor was born on March 21, 1940, in Yonkers, New York. He is the brother of actor Jon Voight and geologist Barry Voight and the uncle of actress Angelina Jolie and actor James Haven. Taylor and his brothers attended Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, New York. In 1961, Taylor attended the University of Hartford in Hartford, Connecticut, for one year.

After an unsuccessful attempt to become a professional golfer like his father, Elmer Voight, Taylor entered the music business.

== Career ==
=== As songwriter ===
Taylor wrote many pop and rock songs, both alone and with other songwriters, including Al Gorgoni (with whom he also performed, as the duo Just Us), Billy Vera, Ted Daryll, and Jerry Ragovoy, first freelancing and then as an employee of a New York City music publisher.

Taylor&#x27;s first big hit was &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, which, though first recorded in 1965 by Jordan Christopher and the Wild Ones, became famous as both a hit single by the Troggs in 1966 and a live performance by Jimi Hendrix in 1967, and was later covered by the Runaways, the Muppets, and X. &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; was first recorded by Evie Sands in 1967, before becoming a hit for Merrilee Rush and also P. P. Arnold in 1968, then a million-selling single in 1981 for country-pop singer Juice Newton; later a rendition from Chrissie Hynde was released.

Other notable pop and country songs written by Taylor include &quot;He Sits at Your Table&quot; (Willie Nelson), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot; (Evie Sands, the Hollies, Linda Ronstadt), &quot;The Baby&quot; (the Hollies), &quot;Worry&quot; (Johnny Tillotson), &quot;Make Me Belong to You&quot; (Barbara Lewis), &quot;I Can Make It With You&quot; (the Pozo Seco Singers, Jackie DeShannon), &quot;Any Way That You Want Me&quot; (the Troggs, Evie Sands, Melanie, American Breed, Juice Newton,  Mary Mason, Lita Ford, Liverpool Five), &quot;On My Word&quot; (Cliff Richard), &quot;Step Out of Your Mind&quot; (The American Breed), &quot;Country Girl City Man&quot; (Billy Vera and Judy Clay), &quot;I&#x27;ll Hold Out My Hand&quot;, &quot;Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)&quot; (Lorraine Ellison, Janis Joplin), &quot;Julie&quot; (Bobby Fuller Four, Marshall Crenshaw), and &quot;Lonely Is As Lonely Does&quot; (the Fleetwoods).

Shaggy used &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; as the basis for his hit &quot;Angel&quot; in 2001. Ace Frehley &quot;Rock Soldiers&quot; in 1987

In 2009, Ace Records released a compilation CD of some of Taylor&#x27;s compositions as recorded by other artists (&quot;Wild Thing: The Songs of Chip Taylor&quot;).

=== His own recordings ===

Taylor&#x27;s first releases were on the King label and their subsidiary DeLuxe. In 1958, he and the Town Three released two 45s on DeLuxe, numbers 6176 &quot;Midnight Blues&quot; and 6180 &quot;I Want a Lover&quot;. In 1959, he recorded for King as Wes Voight on 5211 &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; In&quot;, and his final recording as Wes Voight on King 5231 &quot;I&#x27;m Ready to Go Steady&quot; and &quot;The Wind and the Cold Black Night&quot;. The two King 45s were released in both mono and stereo, making them some of the first stereo singles available. Taylor has released recordings on Warner Bros., Columbia, and Capitol. His first chart single was his recording (as Chip Taylor) of &quot;Here I Am&quot; in 1962 on Warner Bros. Records. He also had a top 40 hit in Australia in 1963 with &quot;Sandy Sandy&quot; with the Town and Country Brothers, a later iteration of Wes Voight and the Town Three, with Ted Daryll (who wrote the song) and Greg Richards, writers of &quot;She Cried&quot; by Jay and the Americans.

=== Performing and recording in the 1990s and the 21st century ===
Taylor restarted his performing and recording career in 1993.

At the 2001 South by Southwest Music Conference in Austin, Texas, Taylor met singer and violinist Carrie Rodriguez, with whom he performed and recorded Americana music for several years. The duo recorded &quot;Let&#x27;s Leave This Town&quot; in 2002. They released &quot;The Trouble With Humans&quot; the following year and the critically acclaimed &quot;Red Dog Tracks&quot; in 2005. Each has since released successful solo albums. Taylor&#x27;s double-CD &quot;Unglorious Hallelujah/Red Red Rose&quot;, his first solo album in five years, was quickly hailed as &quot;a future classic&quot; by Sonic Magazine, whose reviewer declared: &quot;This is the best we&#x27;ve heard from Chip Taylor so far.&quot; Rodriguez&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Seven Angels on a Bicycle&quot;, was released in August 2006. In late 2006 and early 2007, Rodriguez toured on her own but continued to perform with Taylor from time to time. Taylor has done a series of shows with guitarist John Platania and the young singer/fiddler Kendel Carson, and he produced both their 2007 albums.

During the 21st century through 2020, Taylor has continued to perform with his band The New Ukrainians (John Platania on electric guitar, Björn Petterson on bass, and a revolving cast of other musicians). Each concert almost always includes both &quot;Wild Thing&quot; and &quot;Angel in the Morning&quot;.

Taylor&#x27;s album &quot;Yonkers, NY&quot; was a 2011 nominee for a Grammy Award for best recording package, but lost to &quot;Brothers&quot; by the Black Keys.

In 2012, Paal Flaata released an album of only Chip Taylor songs, &quot;Wait By the Fire – Songs of Chip Taylor&quot;.

===Rainy Day Records===

In 1967, Taylor, along with Al Gorgoni, formed Rainy Day Records, which was distributed by Jubilee Records. The label released the single &quot;Night Owl&quot; by the Flying Machine, a group that included James Taylor.

=== Train Wreck Records ===
In 2007, Taylor launched his own independent label, Train Wreck Records.

== Personal life ==
By Taylor&#x27;s own accounts, from 1980 through 1995 he was very successful at, but unhappily addicted to, gambling professionally on blackjack in New Jersey casinos and on horse races. He then returned to music, starting by singing to his dying mother, Barbara Voight. Taylor has said that the gambling addiction was hard on both himself and his family. He has written that, after having an epiphany, he changed his attitude and created the &quot;Church of the Train Wreck&quot; self-help program for himself and others.

Taylor continues to live in New York City. He has been married to Joan Carole Frey since 1964, and they have children and grandchildren. (Joan and Chip were temporarily divorced for several years, starting in the 1990s.)

<doc id="502885" wikidata="Q359047" url="?curid=502885" title="Bernard Berenson">
<text>Bernard Berenson (June 26, 1865 – October 6, 1959) was an American art historian specializing in the Renaissance. His book &quot;The Drawings of the Florentine Painters&quot; was an international success. His wife Mary is thought to have had a large hand in some of the writings.

Berenson was a major figure in the attribution of Old Masters, at a time when these were attracting new interest by American collectors, and his judgments were widely respected in the art world.

==Personal life==
Berenson was born Bernhard Valvrojenski in Butrimonys, Vilnius Governorate (now in Alytus district of Lithuania) to a Litvak family – father Albert Valvrojenski, mother Judith Mickleshanski, and younger siblings including Senda Berenson Abbott. His father, Albert, grew up following an educational track of classical Jewish learning and contemplated becoming a rabbi. However, he became a practitioner of Haskalah, a European movement which advocated more integration of Jews into secular society. After his home and lumber business were destroyed by fire, he lived with his more traditionalist in-laws who pressured him to enroll Bernard with a Hebrew and Aramaic tutor. Instead, they immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1875, whereupon the family name was changed to &quot;Berenson.&quot; Bernard converted to Christianity in 1885, becoming an Episcopalian. Later, while living in Italy, he converted to Catholicism.

After graduating from Boston Latin School, he attended the Boston University College of Liberal Arts as a freshman during 1883 to 1884, but, unable to obtain instruction in Sanskrit from that institution, transferred to Harvard University for his sophomore year. He graduated from Harvard and married Mary Smith, who became a notable art historian in her own right. Mary was the sister of Logan Pearsall Smith and of Alys Pearsall Smith, the first wife of Bertrand Russell. Mary had previously been married to barrister Frank Costelloe. Bernard Berenson was also involved in a long relationship with Belle da Costa Greene. Samuels (1987) mentions Mary&#x27;s &quot;reluctant acceptance (at times)&quot; of this relationship.

Among his friends were American writer Ray Bradbury, who wrote about their friendship in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and in his book of essays, &quot;Yestermorrow&quot;; Natalie Barney, who lived in Florence during World War II, and also her partner, Romaine Brooks; and art collector Edward Perry Warren. His circle of friends also included Isabella Stewart Gardner, Ralph Adams Cram, and George Santayana, the latter two having met each other through Bernard.

Marisa Berenson, an actress, is a distant cousin of Berenson&#x27;s through Louis Kossivitsky. Louis was a nephew of Berenson&#x27;s father, Albert Valvrojenski, the orphaned son of his sister. On arrival in the U.S. both Kossivitsky and Valvrojenski took the name of Berenson. Her sister, Berry Berenson, was an actress/photographer, and the wife of actor Anthony Perkins. Berry died on American Airlines Flight 11 in the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City.

==Professional life==
Among US collectors of the early 1900s, Berenson was regarded as the pre-eminent authority on Renaissance art. Early in his career, Berenson developed his own unique method of connoisseurship by combining the comparative examination techniques of Giovanni Morelli with the aesthetic idea put forth by John Addington Symonds that something of an artist&#x27;s personality could be detected through his works of art. While his approach remained controversial among European art historians and connoisseurs, he played a pivotal role as an advisor to several important American art collectors, such as Isabella Stewart Gardner, who needed help in navigating the complex and treacherous market of newly fashionable Renaissance art. Berenson&#x27;s expertise eventually became so well regarded that his verdict of authorship could either increase or decrease a painting&#x27;s value dramatically. In this respect Berenson&#x27;s influence was enormous, while his 5% commission made him a wealthy man. (According to Charles Hope, he &quot;had a financial interest in many works...an arrangement that Berenson chose to keep private.&quot; )

Starting with his &quot;The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance with an Index to their Works&quot; (1894), his mix of connoisseurship and systematic approach proved successful. In 1895, his &quot;Lorenzo Lotto: An Essay on Constructive Art Criticism,&quot; won critical acclaim, notably from Heinrich Wölfflin. It was quickly followed by &quot;The Florentine Painters of the Renaissance&quot; (1896), lauded by William James for its innovative application of &quot;elementary psychological categories to the interpretation of higher art&quot;.

In 1897, Berenson added another work to his series of guides, publishing &quot;The Central Italian Painters of the Renaissance&quot;. After that, he devoted six years of work to &quot;The Drawings of the Florentine Painters&quot;, which was published in 1903.

In 1907, he published his &quot;The North Italian Painters of the Renaissance&quot;, where he expressed a judgement against Mannerist art, which may be related to his love for Classicism and his professed distaste for Modern Art. His early works were later integrated in his &quot;The Italian Painters of the Renaissance&quot; (1930), which was widely translated and reprinted. He also published two volumes of journals, &quot;Rumor and Reflection&quot; and &quot;Sunset and Twilight&quot;. He is also the author of &quot;Aesthetics and History&quot; and &quot;Sketch for a Self-portrait&quot;.

=== &quot;I Tatti&quot; ===
His residence in Settignano near Florence, which has been called &quot;I Tatti&quot; since at least the 17th century, became The Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies, a research center offering a residential fellowship to scholars working on all areas of the Italian Renaissance. He had willed it to Harvard well before his death, to the bitter regret of his wife, Mary. It houses his art collection and his personal library of books on art history and humanism, which Berenson regarded as his most enduring legacy. A portrait of daily life at the Berenson &quot;court&quot; at I Tatti during the 1920s, may be found in Sir Kenneth Clark&#x27;s 1974 memoir, &quot;Another Part of the Wood&quot;. &quot;During WW2, barely tolerated by the Fascist authorities and, later on, by their German masters, Berenson remained at &#x27;I Tatti.&#x27; When the frontline reached it at the end of the summer of 1944, he wrote in his diary, &quot;Our hillside happens to lie between the principal line of German retreat along the Via Bolognese and a side road... We are at the heart of the German rearguard action, and seriously exposed.&quot;. The villa remained unharmed. Also unharmed was the bulk of his collections, which had been moved to a villa at Careggi. However, Berenson&#x27;s Florence apartment in the Borgo San Jacopo was destroyed, with some of its contents, during the German retreat from Florence.

Through a secret agreement in 1912, Berenson enjoyed a close relationship with Joseph Duveen, the period&#x27;s most influential art dealer, who often relied heavily on Berenson&#x27;s opinion to complete sales of works to prominent collectors who lacked knowledge of the field. Berenson was quiet and deliberating by nature, which sometimes caused friction between him and the boisterous Duveen. Their relationship ended on bad terms in 1937, following a dispute over a painting.

In 1923, Berenson was called to give expert witness in a famous case brought by a Mrs. Andrée Hahn of Kansas City against Duveen. In 1920, Hahn wanted to sell a painting that she believed to be a version of Leonardo&#x27;s and whose authorship is still debated. Duveen publicly rejected Hahn&#x27;s Leonardo attribution of the painting, which he had never seen. Consequently, Hahn sued him. In 1923 Hahn&#x27;s painting was brought to Paris to be compared with the Louvre version. Duveen mustered Berenson&#x27;s and other experts&#x27; support for his opinion, dismissing Hahn&#x27;s painting as a copy. At the trial in New York in 1929, where the expert witnesses did not appear, the jury was not convinced by Berenson&#x27;s Paris testimony, in part because, while under cross-examination there, he had been unable to recall the medium upon which the picture was painted. It was also revealed that Berenson, as well as other experts who had testified in Paris, such as Roger Fry and Sir Charles Holmes, had previously provided paid expertise to Duveen. While Duveen, after a split verdict, ended up settling out of court with Hahn, the whole story damaged Berenson&#x27;s reputation. 

Berenson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. He died at age 94 in Settignano, Italy.

Recent scholarship has established that Berenson&#x27;s secret agreements with Duveen resulted in substantial profits to himself, as much as 25% of the proceeds, making him a wealthy man. This clear conflict of interest has thrown into doubt many of his authentications for Duveen and a number of these have been shown, through careful examination, to have become more optimistic, therefore considerably more valuable, once he was working for Duveen. No systematic comparison has, as yet, been done, but a partial study of seventy works points to this possibility. The issue is still controversial.

In addition to his better-known collection of Italian Renaissance paintings and objects, Berenson also demonstrated a keen interest in Asian art, including a distinguished collection of Arab and Persian painting.

The Berenson Library (the Biblioteca Berenson) has grown since Berenson gifted his extensive collection of books and photographs to Harvard and now holds an archive of around 250,000 photographic prints and other related materials. Photographs attributed to Berenson are also held in the archive of the Conway Library at The Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Both collections are in the process of being digitised.

==Correspondence==
&quot;The Letters of Bernard Berenson and Isabella Stewart Gardner, 1887-1924&quot;, edited by Rollin van N. Hadley, was published by Northwestern University Press in 1987.

2006 saw the publication of the noted British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper&#x27;s letters to Berenson in the period 1947–60, in a book entitled, &quot;Letters from Oxford: Hugh Trevor-Roper to Bernard Berenson&quot;, edited by Richard Davenport-Hines, published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.

In 2015, Yale University Press published Kenneth Clark&#x27;s correspondence with Berenson in the book, &quot;My Dear BB: The Letters of Bernard Berenson and Kenneth Clark, 1925–1959&quot;, edited and annotated by Robert Cumming.

Nine years worth of correspondence (1950–1959) between Berenson and San Diego–based Norah Bisgood Woodward is held by the Special Collections and Archives at the UC San Diego Library.

Berenson and Ernest Hemingway kept an eight-year-long correspondence from 1949 until 1957, published in Jobst C. Knigge: &quot;Ernest Hemingway and Bernard Berenson. A Strange Friendship&quot;, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (open access).

<text>The University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) is a public university in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1807, it is the second oldest college in Maryland and comprises some of the oldest professional schools of dentistry, law, medicine, pharmacy, social work and nursing in the United States. It is the original campus of the University System of Maryland and has a strategic partnership with the University of Maryland, College Park. Located on on the west side of downtown Baltimore, it is part of the University System of Maryland.

In 2012, the University of Maryland, Baltimore and the flagship University of Maryland, College Park united under the MPowering the State initiative to leverage the strengths of both institutions. The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 officially formalized the partnership. According to the National Science Foundation, the university spent a combined $1.1 billion on research and development in 2019, ranking it 14th overall in the nation and 8th among all public institutions.

==History==
The University of Maryland, Baltimore was founded in 1807 as the Maryland College of Medicine. In 1812, it was rechartered as the University of Maryland and given the authority to establish additional faculties in law, divinity, and arts and sciences. The faculty of law was founded in 1816, though it operated intermittently until 1868. The faculty of arts and sciences known as the Baltimore College for undergraduates also operated intermittently in the early 19th century. From 1907 to 1920, St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis functioned as the University of Maryland&#x27;s faculty of arts and sciences; this loose federation was dissolved in 1920 when the Maryland State College, (the former Maryland Agricultural College), founded 1856, as the state&#x27;s land grant college, became part of a larger University of Maryland with the graduate level professional schools on the westside of downtown Baltimore. In 1970, the General Assembly of Maryland (state legislature) established a five-campus University of Maryland network comprising the

* University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) (professional graduate level schools);
* University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) (between Arbutus and Catonsville in southwest Baltimore County);
* University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) (flagship university);
* University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) (at Princess Anne in Somerset County); and the
* University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC) (extension and foreign programs)

with a system-wide president located in College Park and a chancellor in charge of each campus; in 1988 this institution was merged with the State University and College System of Maryland (of former normal and state teachers colleges, now wider liberal arts schools since the 1960s) to form the new University System of Maryland.

==Professional schools==

===School of Dentistry===

The University of Maryland School of Dentistry was the first dental school in the world. Founded in 1840 as the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery (BCDS), it was chartered by an act of the Maryland General Assembly. Its principal founders were Drs. Horace H. Hayden and Chapin A. Harris. It was the first school in the world to offer a science-based curriculum in dentistry. It currently ranks among top 10 in the nation to receive NIH research funding. The school moved to a new building in October 2006. The new building, located adjacent to the old one on Baltimore Street, offers some of the newest facilities and technologies in the world for education and patient care. The cost of construction and equipment was over US$140 million, the highest spent by the state of Maryland on an academic building.

===School of Law===

The University of Maryland School of Law opened in 1816 as the &quot;Maryland Law Institute&quot; &quot;in a spacious and commodious building on South Street, near Market street.&quot; (later renamed East Baltimore Street) It is the third-oldest law school in the nation. It was founded by 
David Hoffman, who authored a comprehensive course of legal study that had a lasting influence on other law school programs around the country and led to the development of legal ethics programs and responsibilities. The law school moved to a new building of English Tudor Revival architecture replacing its earlier modernistic structure on the same site at the northwest corner of West Baltimore and North Paca Streets in 2002, adjacent to the site to the north of the old Westminster Presbyterian Church and old Western Burying Grounds facing West Fayette and North Greene Streets (first laid out in 1787, on which the later church was built on top of resting on brick arched piers in 1852), the cemetery where the famous poet and writer Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) is buried. It is the only law school in the United States with a famous author buried on its campus. The former restored church building, now known as Westminster Hall is used for campus events and lectures and is often requested for wedding and other social ceremonies.

The University of Maryland School of Law was ranked 48th among law schools according to the 2017 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; law school rankings and was also ranked among the top 10 programs for health law, clinical law and environmental law. The School of Law&#x27;s students&#x27; undergraduate median GPA is a 3.47 and median Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) score is a 158. It admits 52.4% of applicants. The law school takes about 225 full-time day students and about 50 evening students per year.

The current Dean of the School of Law is Renée Hutchins, a leading expert on the Fourth Amendment and criminal appellate practice.

===School of Medicine===

Established in 1807 as the College of Medicine of Maryland, University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMB SOM) was the first public medical school in the United States and it is the fifth oldest medical school in the country. The campus includes Davidge Hall, designed by Robert Cary Long, Sr. in the style of the Pantheon in Rome, which was built in 1812 at the northeast corner of West Lombard and South Greene Streets, on the west side of downtown Baltimore, and is the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the Hemisphere. UMB SOM was ranked 27th in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; magazine″s 2022 rankings of &quot;Best Medical Schools: Research&quot; and 12th in &quot;Best Medical Schools: Primary Care&quot;.

The School of Medicine is closely affiliated with the University of Maryland Medical Center and Medical System. It houses the Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences (PTRS), the Department of Medical and Research Technology (DMRT), and two research institutes, the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) and the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS). It also offers PhD programs through the Graduate Program in Life Sciences and several combined degree programs: the MD/PhD MSTP (Medical Scientist Training Program), the MD/MPH (Master of Public Health), and an MD/ in Public Health.

In a 2011 article in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, Steven Salzberg criticized the school&#x27;s inclusion of pseudoscientific subjects such as homeopathy in the curriculum. According to Salzberg, the school is &quot;mis-training medical students&quot; by teaching courses in integrative medicine.

===School of Nursing===
The University of Maryland School of Nursing (UMSON), founded in 1889 by Florence Nightingale-trained nurse Louisa Parsons, is one of the oldest and largest nursing schools in the United States. In the magazine, the University of Maryland School of Nursing was ranked 6th nationally.

The UMSON building, which opened in November 1998, shares an urban campus on the west side of downtown Baltimore with five nearby professional schools — Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy and Social Work — as well as the University of Maryland Medical System (formerly University of Maryland Hospital) and the U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

UMSON has pioneered the first nursing informatics program in the world and the nation&#x27;s first nursing health policy program. More than 20 specialties are offered at the graduate level, including trauma/critical-care, oncology, gerontology, psychiatric/mental health nursing, and nursing administration. In 1999, the School of Nursing became the only school in Maryland to offer a midwifery program, pre-accredited by the American College of Nurse Midwives. Nurse practitioner options are also offered in family, pediatrics, women&#x27;s health, neonatal intensive care, adult primary care, acute care and geriatrics.

Programs include the second bachelor&#x27;s degree option, the RN to BSN online program, the RN to MS program, the post-baccalaureate entry option into the PhD program, and the MS/MBA and PhD/MBA programs offered in conjunction with the University of Baltimore; Frostburg State University; and the Robert H. Smith School of Business, at the University of Maryland, College Park. Partnership programs for BSN completion join the School of Nursing with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the University of Maryland, College Park, Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay, as well as all of Maryland&#x27;s community colleges.

To provide clinical programs for students, UMSON maintains affiliations with more than 300 hospitals and health care agencies throughout Maryland.

The University of Maryland School of Nursing Living History Museum, which opened in October 1999, examines the history of the nursing profession from its earliest days to present day.

===School of Pharmacy===
The University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, founded in 1841, is the fourth oldest school of pharmacy in the nation and was the first pharmacy school established in Maryland. The School of Pharmacy comprises three departments, Pharmacy Practice and Science, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Pharmaceutical Health Services Research. The school admitted 11.4% of applicants for the 2006–2007 school year. According to the most recent pharmacy school rankings, The University of Maryland School of Pharmacy was ranked 9th among pharmacy schools in the 2016 edition of U.S. News &amp; World Report.

===School of Social Work===
University of Maryland School of Social Work graduates have become policymakers at all levels of government, from the U.S. Senate to the state and federal courts, to the State Department and departments of social services. Graduates also work as educators and researchers at universities across the country and have become therapists, community organizers, and managers. In 2022, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked it 21st in the nation for social work.

===Graduate School, Baltimore===
The Graduate School was founded in 1918. It offers 43 degree programs in total and oversees the partnership between UMB and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) with additional programs that span across both institutions.

==Libraries==
The University of Maryland, Baltimore has two main libraries on its campus: the Health Sciences &amp; Human Services Library (HS/HSL) and the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.

UMB&#x27;s Health Sciences &amp; Human Services Library (HS/HSL) was founded in 1813 from the collection of Doctor John Crawford, a former British naval surgeon. Dr. Crawford&#x27;s initial donation of books remains within the library&#x27;s Historical Collections department as the Crawford Collection (comprising some 569 items). The first location of the library was the Provost&#x27;s Office within the original medical school building, now known as Davidge Hall. Under the leadership of its first official library, Dr. Eugene F. Cordell (who served as library director from 1903 to 1913), the library grew rapidly, incorporating book collections from the schools of pharmacy and dentistry, and moving into its own building, a former church on the southeast corner of Lombard and Green Streets. The church was later razed in 1957 to make way for a new library that began construction in 1958 and opened in 1960. The library has since moved, in 1998, into a large modern building. The HS/HSL offers 45 group study rooms, 3 computer classrooms, several conference rooms with the web conferencing capability, and the Presentation Practice Studio, in addition to many study carrels and a number of public computers in a five-story building. In March, 2015, it opened the new Innovation Space designed for innovative and collaborative hands-on learning experience with 3D printers and 3D scanners.

The Thurgood Marshall Law Library, named for Baltimore native and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, is the law library for the University of Maryland School of Law. The Marshall Law Library is found inside the law school&#x27;s building, accessible through the main entrance. The Thurgood Marshall Law Library contains over 400,000 volumes of Anglo-American legal materials as well as outstanding international and foreign law collections. Extensive collections of both primary sources and secondary materials such as treatises are available. The library is open to all faculty, staff and students on the campuses of the University System of Maryland; University of Maryland School of Law alumni; attorneys; and members of the general public.

==Name of the institution==
The professional schools housed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, may also simply use the name &quot;University of Maryland&quot; when describing themselves even though the University of Maryland, College Park, also refers to itself simply as the University of Maryland. There is relatively little confusion resulting from the shared name because the University of Maryland, College Park, offers largely research-oriented graduate programs and houses fewer professional schools. The University of Maryland, Baltimore, does not offer NCAA sports. Although this university mainly offers graduate and professional study, it also offers a few undergraduate courses, which include nursing, dental hygiene, and medical technology. By law and tradition, each school is entitled to use the &quot;University of Maryland&quot; name in recognition of their shared history. While both schools are institutions which belong to the University System of Maryland, neither is a part of the other.

The University of Maryland, Baltimore is also often mistaken for the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and the University of Baltimore (UB) which are separate University System of Maryland institutions in Catonsville (outside the City of Baltimore) and Downtown Baltimore, respectively.

==Campus==

The campus is composed of 58 buildings located near Camden Yards, the Baltimore Convention Center, and Baltimore&#x27;s famous Lexington Market. Construction on a new campus center began at the start of 2007 and opened in August 2009 as the Southern Management Corporation Campus Center (SMC Center). The SMC ` Center contains dining facilities, meeting locations and the campus&#x27;s gymnasium and recreation facility, URecFit. UMB has also recently undertaken a vast west campus expansion. This project, known as BioPark, created ten new buildings containing a total of of classroom, lab, and office space. In addition, University of Maryland Medical System cleared a downtown site for the construction of a $329 million ambulatory care center.

The university is served by the University Center/Baltimore Street station of the Baltimore Light Rail system, which is at the eastern edge of campus. The Orange Route of the free Charm City Circulator provides service to both the BioPark and through the UMB campus to the Inner Harbor and points east. The university is also served by Camden Station, which connects the campus by MARC Train to the University of Maryland, College Park and Union Station in Washington, D.C.

Starting with the 2012–2013 school year, the university launched a new shuttle bus service for university students, staff, and faculty and University of Maryland Medical Center employees free of charge. The shuttle runs 3 routes from the university to West Baltimore (the BioPark center), Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon. The shuttle will discontinue its current service after summer 2019; the university is currently exploring transportation alternatives.

==Campus police==
The university is protected through the University of Maryland, Baltimore Police Department. The UMB Police Department is a state- and nationally accredited police agency providing law enforcement services to the UMB campus and surrounding communities. Through an agreement signed between the UMB Police Department and the Baltimore Police Department, UMB Police officers have the same jurisdiction and authority as Baltimore Police officers throughout the campus of the university. The UMB Police Department is composed of both sworn police officers and unarmed security officers who are located in University-owned buildings to control access to the buildings and for other security purposes. The UMB Police Department also provides Safe Walk and Safe Ride services to students and university personnel throughout the campus and into surrounding neighborhoods.

In 2021, the University of Maryland, Baltimore Police Department was awarded the prestigious International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP)/Walmart Leadership in Community Policing Award for a midsize agency. The department was also awarded the 2020 Maryland Chiefs of Police Association&#x27;s Exceptional Police Performance by a Unit/Team/Collaboration Award for their Community Outreach and Support Team (COAST).

The UMB Police Department Community Outreach and Support Team (COAST) was created in 2018 by previous UMB Police Chief Alice Cary. The department is the third university police department in the country to welcome a comfort k-9, Officer Lexi and only one of two university Police Athletics/Activities Leagues (PAL) in the country. The department is a leader in homeless outreach and crisis intervention, working with the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) to redirect low-level drug offenders into treatment. In Fall 2021, student interns from the School of Social Work will partner with the UMB Police Department to provide additional resources to vulnerable populations.

<doc id="502892" wikidata="Q17142655" url="?curid=502892" title="Multi-frequency signaling">
<text>In telephony, multi-frequency signaling (MF) is a type of signaling that was introduced by the Bell System after World War II. It uses a combination of audible tones for address (telephone number) transport and supervision signaling on trunk lines between central offices. The signaling is sent &quot;in-band&quot; over the same channel as the bearer channel used for voice traffic.

Multi-frequency signaling defines electronic signals that consist of a combination of two audible frequencies, usually selected from a set of six frequencies. Over several decades, various types of MF signaling were developed, including national and international varieties. The CCITT standardization process specified the American Bell System version as &quot;Regional Standard No. 1&quot;, or Signalling System R1, and a corresponding European standard as Signalling System R2. Both were largely replaced by digital systems, such as Signalling System 7, which operate out-of-band on a separate data network.

Because of the in-band transmission characteristic of MF signaling, the systems proved vulnerable to misuse and fraud by phone phreaking with devices such as a blue box.

Multifrequency signaling is a technological precursor of dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF, &quot;Touch-Tone&quot;), which uses the same fundamental principle, but was used primarily for signaling address information and control signals from a user&#x27;s telephone to the wire-center&#x27;s Class-5 switch. DTMF uses a total of eight frequencies.

== Operation ==

Digits are represented by two simultaneous tones selected from a set of five (MF 2/5), six (MF 2/6), or eight (MF 2/8) frequencies. The frequency combinations are played, one at a time for each digit, to the remote multi-frequency receiver in a distant telephone exchange. MF is used for signaling in trunking applications.

Using MF signaling, the originating telephone switch sends a start signal to seize the line, taking the circuit off-hook. The terminating office acknowledges the seizure with a ready state by responding with a wink start signal, which is a momentary off-hook condition. The originating office then sends address information to the terminating switch. In R1 MF signaling this address information normally is a KP tone, the numeric digits of the destination number, and an ST tone to indicate the end of the address. Other information may also be added, such as the caller&#x27;s number, using KP2 as a delimiter.

MF is a type of in-band signaling. Depending on the type and configuration of switching equipment, it may or may not be audible to the telephone user, but the technology was vulnerable to abuse with a method called phreaking with a blue box which generates the tones required to control remote telephone switches.

==Multi-frequency signals==
The Bell System published the following standards for MF tone timing:
* KP (110 ms)
* Digits 0-9, ST: 55 ms
The interval between digits is the same as the digit duration (55 ms)

These standards are, for the most part, still in place where MF signaling is in use in legacy exchanges. MF signaling is still used in North America for inter-office signaling, although it is increasingly rare.

==Demise==
In-band signaling fell into disfavor in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) as electronic switching systems displaced electro-mechanical switching systems, but legacy offices may still exist in some countries that are still using some electromechanical and other legacy switching equipment.

Out-of-band Common Channel Signaling (CCS) became nearly universal by the end of the 20th century in the United States. Benefits include higher connection establishment rate and better fraud security.

Most 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) use the MF format to identify the calling party to the PSAP when processing calls from Mobile Telephone Switching Offices (MTSOs) and landline telephone exchanges. This is based on an earlier system which used MF to identify the calling party to a feature group &#x27;D&#x27; (101xxxx) alternate long-distance provider.

<doc id="502897" wikidata="Q846677" url="?curid=502897" title="Remainder">
<text>In mathematics, the remainder is the amount &quot;left over&quot; after performing some computation. In arithmetic, the remainder is the integer &quot;left over&quot; after dividing one integer by another to produce an integer quotient (integer division). In algebra of polynomials, the remainder is the polynomial &quot;left over&quot; after dividing one polynomial by another. The &quot;modulo operation&quot; is the operation that produces such a remainder when given a dividend and divisor.

Alternatively, a remainder is also what is left after subtracting one number from another, although this is more precisely called the &quot;difference&quot;. This usage can be found in some elementary textbooks; colloquially it is replaced by the expression &quot;the rest&quot; as in &quot;Give me two dollars back and keep the rest.&quot; However, the term &quot;remainder&quot; is still used in this sense when a function is approximated by a series expansion, where the error expression (&quot;the rest&quot;) is referred to as the remainder term.

== Integer division ==

Given an integer &quot;a&quot; and a non-zero integer &quot;d&quot;, it can be shown that there exist unique integers &quot;q&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, such that and . The number &quot;q&quot; is called the &quot;quotient&quot;, while &quot;r&quot; is called the &quot;remainder&quot;.

(For a proof of this result, see &quot;Euclidean division&quot;. For algorithms describing how to calculate the remainder, see &quot;Division algorithm&quot;.)

The remainder, as defined above, is called the &quot;least positive remainder&quot; or simply the &quot;remainder&quot;. The integer &quot;a&quot; is either a multiple of &quot;d&quot;, or lies in the interval between consecutive multiples of &quot;d&quot;, namely, &quot;q&quot;⋅&quot;d&quot; and (&quot;q&quot; + 1)&quot;d&quot; (for positive &quot;q&quot;).

In some occasions, it is convenient to carry out the division so that &quot;a&quot; is as close to an integral multiple of &quot;d&quot; as possible, that is, we can write 
: &quot;a&quot; = &quot;k⋅d&quot; + &quot;s&quot;, with ≤ for some integer &quot;k&quot;.
In this case, &quot;s&quot; is called the &quot;least absolute remainder&quot;. As with the quotient and remainder, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are uniquely determined, except in the case where &quot;d&quot; = 2&quot;n&quot; and &quot;s&quot; = ± &quot;n&quot;. For this exception, we have:
: &quot;a&quot; = &quot;k⋅d&quot; + &quot;n&quot; = (&quot;k&quot; + 1)&quot;d&quot; − &quot;n&quot;.
A unique remainder can be obtained in this case by some convention—such as always taking the positive value of &quot;s&quot;.

=== Examples ===
In the division of 43 by 5, we have:
: 43 = 8 × 5 + 3,
so 3 is the least positive remainder. We also have that:
: 43 = 9 × 5 − 2,
and −2 is the least absolute remainder.

These definitions are also valid if &quot;d&quot; is negative, for example, in the division of 43 by −5,
: 43 = (−8) × (−5) + 3,
and 3 is the least positive remainder, while,
: 43 = (−9) × (−5) + (−2)
and −2 is the least absolute remainder.

In the division of 42 by 5, we have:
: 42 = 8 × 5 + 2,
and since 2 &lt; 5/2, 2 is both the least positive remainder and the least absolute remainder.

In these examples, the (negative) least absolute remainder is obtained from the least positive remainder by subtracting 5, which is &quot;d&quot;. This holds in general. When dividing by &quot;d&quot;, either both remainders are positive and therefore equal, or they have opposite signs. If the positive remainder is &quot;r&quot;1, and the negative one is &quot;r&quot;2, then
: &quot;r&quot;1 = &quot;r&quot;2 + &quot;d&quot;.

== For floating-point numbers ==

When &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are floating-point numbers, with &quot;d&quot; non-zero, &quot;a&quot; can be divided by &quot;d&quot; without remainder, with the quotient being another floating-point number. If the quotient is constrained to being an integer, however, the concept of remainder is still necessary. It can be proved that there exists a unique integer quotient &quot;q&quot; and a unique floating-point remainder &quot;r&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; = &quot;qd&quot; + &quot;r&quot; with 0 ≤ &quot;r&quot; &lt; .

Extending the definition of remainder for floating-point numbers, as described above, is not of theoretical importance in mathematics; however, many programming languages implement this definition (see &quot;Modulo operation&quot;).

== In programming languages ==
While there are no difficulties inherent in the definitions, there are implementation issues that arise when negative numbers are involved in calculating remainders. Different programming languages have adopted different conventions. For example:
* Pascal chooses the result of the &quot;mod&quot; operation positive, but does not allow &quot;d&quot; to be negative or zero (so, is not always valid).&lt;ref name=&quot;iso/iec 7185:1990 6.7.2.2&quot;&gt;Pascal ISO 7185:1990 6.7.2.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* C99 chooses the remainder with the same sign as the dividend &quot;a&quot;. (Before C99, the C language allowed other choices.)
* Perl, Python (only modern versions) choose the remainder with the same sign as the divisor &quot;d&quot;.
* Scheme offer two functions, &quot;remainder&quot; and &quot;modulo&quot; – Ada and PL/I have &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;rem&quot;, while Fortran has &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;modulo&quot;; in each case, the former agrees in sign with the dividend, and the latter with the divisor. Common Lisp and Haskell also have &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;rem&quot;, but &quot;mod&quot; uses the sign of the divisor and &quot;rem&quot; uses the sign of the dividend.

== Polynomial division ==
Euclidean division of polynomials is very similar to Euclidean division of integers and leads to polynomial remainders. Its existence is based on the following theorem: Given two univariate polynomials &quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (where &quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a non-zero polynomial) defined over a field (in particular, the reals or complex numbers), there exist two polynomials &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (the &quot;quotient&quot;) and &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (the &quot;remainder&quot;) which satisfy:
: formula_1
where
: formula_2
where &quot;deg(...)&quot; denotes the degree of the polynomial (the degree of the constant polynomial whose value is always 0 can be defined to be negative, so that this degree condition will always be valid when this is the remainder). Moreover, &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are uniquely determined by these relations.

This differs from the Euclidean division of integers in that, for the integers, the degree condition is replaced by the bounds on the remainder &quot;r&quot; (non-negative and less than the divisor, which insures that &quot;r&quot; is unique.) The similarity between Euclidean division for integers and that for polynomials motivates the search for the most general algebraic setting in which Euclidean division is valid. The rings for which such a theorem exists are called Euclidean domains, but in this generality, uniqueness of the quotient and remainder is not guaranteed.

Polynomial division leads to a result known as the polynomial remainder theorem: If a polynomial &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is divided by &quot;x&quot; − &quot;k&quot;, the remainder is the constant &quot;r&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;k&quot;).

<text>Night on Bald Mountain (), also known as Night on the Bare Mountain, is a series of compositions by Modest Mussorgsky (1839–1881). Inspired by Russian and legend, Mussorgsky composed a &quot;musical picture&quot;, &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve on Bald Mountain&quot; () on the theme of a Witches&#x27; Sabbath occurring at Bald Mountain on St. John&#x27;s Eve, which he completed on that very night, 23 June 1867. Together with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Sadko&quot; (1867), it is one of the first tone poems by a Russian composer.

Although Mussorgsky was proud of his youthful effort, his mentor, Mily Balakirev, refused to perform it. To salvage what he considered worthy material, Mussorgsky attempted to insert his &quot;Bald Mountain&quot; music, recast for vocal soloists, chorus, and orchestra, into two subsequent projects—the collaborative opera-ballet &quot;Mlada&quot; (1872), and the opera &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot; (1880). However, &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; was never performed in any form during Mussorgsky&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1886, five years after Mussorgsky&#x27;s death, Rimsky-Korsakov published an arrangement of the work, described as a &quot;fantasy for orchestra.&quot; Some musical scholars consider this version to be an original composition of Rimsky-Korsakov, albeit one based on Mussorgsky&#x27;s last version of the music, for &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot;:

It is through Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s version that &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; achieved lasting fame. Premiering in Saint Petersburg in 1886, the work became a concert favourite. Half a century later, the work obtained perhaps its greatest exposure through the Walt Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), featuring an arrangement by Leopold Stokowski, based on Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s version. Mussorgsky&#x27;s tone poem was not published in its original form until 1968. It has started to gain exposure and become familiar to modern audiences.

==Name==
The original Russian title of the tone poem, &quot;Иванова ночь на лысой горе&quot;, translates literally as &quot;Saint John&#x27;s Eve on Bald Mountain&quot;, usually shortened to &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;. However, due to several ambiguities, the composition is also known by a number of alternative titles in English.

The Russian word &quot;ночь&quot; (&quot;noch′&quot;) is literally &quot;night&quot; in English, but idiomatically this would refer to the night following St. John&#x27;s Day, variously observed between 21 June (the summer solstice) and 25 June. The night before St. John&#x27;s Day is usually referred to as &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot; in English; Russian does not make this distinction.

&quot;Bald Mountain&quot; is the most familiar translation of &quot;лысой горе&quot; (&quot;lysoy gore&quot;) in English, and is also the most literal. The adjective &quot;bald&quot; is commonly used in English place names for barren hills, mountains, and other features, and so is also idiomatic. However, because the most familiar use of &quot;bald&quot; describes hairlessness, this part of the title is also known as &quot;Bare Mountain&quot;. The use of &quot;bald&quot; to describe barren landscapes is common in European languages. In French, the piece is known as and in Italian (&quot;A Night on Bald Mountain&quot;).

Some performances of the work also insert the article &quot;the&quot; before &quot;Bald Mountain&quot; or &quot;Bare Mountain&quot;. Articles are not used in Russian, but are often applied to nouns when translating Russian into languages that regularly use articles, such as English and French. However, because the title of the work refers to a specific place &quot;called&quot; &quot;Bald Mountain&quot;, an article would not normally be used in English.

==Early unrealized projects==

===Opera project: &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot; (1858)===
A sheet of paper apparently found among Mussorgsky&#x27;s manuscripts contains the following statement:

Program of the opera &quot;St. John&#x27;s Night&quot;, in three acts, after the tale by Gogol, written by P. Boborïkin, in the presence and with the help of Modest Mussorgsky, Yevgeniy Mussorgsky, and Vasiliy. Witness to the proceedings: Mily Balakirev.

This curious fragment, dated 25 December 1858, has been interpreted as an indication of Mussorgsky&#x27;s intent to write an opera on the subject of Gogol&#x27;s short story &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot; (, &quot;Vecher nakanune Ivana Kupala&quot;, &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot;). Gogol&#x27;s tale contains the elements of witchcraft common to other stories in the &quot;Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka&quot; collection, but does not feature a Witches&#x27; Sabbath. No further plans for this project were mentioned.

===Opera project: &quot;The Witch&quot; (1860)===
The theme of a witches&#x27; sabbath, the central theme in all subsequent &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; projects, appears to have been derived from the nonextant play &quot;The Witch&quot; (, &quot;Ved′ma&quot;) by Baron Georgiy Mengden, a military friend of the composer. In 1860 Mussorgsky informed Balakirev that he had been commissioned to write one act of an opera on this subject:

However, as with the previous project, it is unknown whether any materials were written down, and, if so, whether they were transferred to subsequent projects.

===Work for piano and orchestra (early 1860s)===
Rimsky-Korsakov declares in his memoirs (&quot;Chronicle of My Musical Life&quot;) that in the early 1860s Mussorgsky, under the influence of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Totentanz&quot;, had written a version of the &quot;Bald Mountain&quot; music for piano and orchestra. However, it is believed that Mussorgsky did not hear Liszt&#x27;s work until 1866, by which time he was planning the orchestral tone poem &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve on Bald Mountain&quot; (see below). No trace of a work for piano and orchestra has survived outside Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s recollections, so it is assumed that the score has been lost, or, more likely, that it never existed.

==Tone poem: &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve on Bald Mountain&quot; (1867)==

===Composition history===
In 1866 Mussorgsky wrote to Balakirev expressing a desire to discuss his plans for &quot;The Witches&quot;, his informal name for his &quot;Bald Mountain&quot; music. In early June 1867, he began composing the orchestral version of the piece. The score is inscribed with the following details:

Conceived in 1866. Began to write for orchestra 12 June 1867, completed work on the eve of St. John&#x27;s Day, 23 June 1867, in Luga District on Minkino Farm. Modest Mussorgskiy.

&quot;Russian original&quot;: Задумана в 1866 году. Начал писать на оркестр 12-го июня 1867 года, окончил работу в Канун Иванова дня 23 июня 1867 года в Лугском уезде на Мызе Минкино. Модест Мусоргский

Mussorgsky described the piece in a letter to Vladimir Nikolsky:

So far as my memory doesn&#x27;t deceive me, the witches used to gather on this mountain, ... gossip, play tricks and await their chief—Satan. On his arrival they, i.e. the witches, formed a circle round the throne on which he sat, in the form of a kid, and sang his praise. When Satan was worked up into a sufficient passion by the witches&#x27; praises, he gave the command for the sabbath, in which he chose for himself the witches who caught his fancy. So this is what I&#x27;ve done. At the head of my score I&#x27;ve put its content: 1. Assembly of the witches, their talk and gossip; 2. Satan&#x27;s journey; 3. Obscene praises of Satan; and 4. Sabbath ... The form and character of the composition are Russian and original ... I wrote &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot; quickly, straight away in full score, I wrote it in about twelve days, glory to God ... While at work on &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot; I didn&#x27;t sleep at night and actually finished the work on the eve of St. John&#x27;s Day, it seethed within me so, and I simply didn&#x27;t know what was happening within me ... I see in my wicked prank an independent Russian product, free from German profundity and routine, and, like &quot;Savishna&quot;, grown on our native fields and nurtured on Russian bread.
He also stated—incorrectly, as it turned out—that he would never re-model it: &quot;with whatever shortcomings, it is born; and with them it must live if it is to live at all.&quot; Having finally completed the work, Mussorgsky was crushed when his mentor Mily Balakirev was savagely critical of it. The score is peppered with comments such as &quot;the devil knows what [this is]&quot;, &quot;what rubbish&quot;, and &quot;this might be of use&quot;, probably pencilled in by Balakirev. This &quot;first version&quot; was put aside, and did not appear in print until 1968, in a new edition prepared by Georgiy Kirkor.

===Performance history===
The original tone poem, &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve on Bald Mountain&quot; (1867), was not performed until the 20th century. Musicologist Aleksandra Orlova claims that the original manuscript of this version was discovered in the library of the Leningrad Conservatory by musicologist Georgiy Orlov in the late 1920s, that it was performed once by the Leningrad Philharmonic Society, and that Nikolay Malko brought along a copy of it when he emigrated to the West. Gerald Abraham states that this version was performed by Malko on 3 February 1932, apparently in England. Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi claims that Malko performed this version in several countries in 1933.

==&quot;Glorification of Chernobog&quot; from &quot;Mlada&quot; (1872)==

===Composition history===
The first re-modelling of the tone poem took place in 1872, when Mussorgsky revised and recast it for vocal soloists, chorus, and orchestra as part of act 3 that he was assigned to contribute to the collaborative opera-ballet &quot;Mlada&quot;. In this new version the music was to form the basis of the &quot;Night on Mount Triglav&quot; (, &quot;Noch′ na gore Triglave&quot;) scene.

Mussorgsky referred to this piece under the title &quot;Glorification of Chernobog&quot; (, &quot;Slavlenye Chornoboga&quot;) in a list of his compositions given to Vladimir Stasov. In 1930, Pavel Lamm, in his edition of Mussorgsky&#x27;s complete works, referred to the piece as &quot;Worship of the Black Goat&quot; (, &quot;Sluzheniye chornomy kozlu&quot;).

&quot;Mlada&quot; was a project doomed to failure, however, and this &quot;second version&quot; languished along with the first. The score of &quot;Glorification of Chernobog&quot; has not survived, and was never published or performed.

===Program===
The following scenario is taken from Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s later &quot;magic opera-ballet&quot; &quot;Mlada&quot; (1890), based on the same libretto by Viktor Krïlov.

====Setting====

&quot;Mlada&quot; is set in the 9th or 10th century city of Retra, in the (formerly) Slavic lands between the Baltic Sea coast and the Elbe River. This would be the land of the pre-Christian Polabian Slavs, in the region corresponding to the modern German areas of Holstein, Mecklenburg, or Vorpommern.

The &quot;Mlada&quot; scenario is the only &quot;Bald Mountain&quot; setting that mentions a &quot;Mt. Triglav&quot;, where the supernatural events of act 3 take place. The name Triglav (&quot;tri&quot; three + &quot;glav&quot; head) happens to be the name of an ancient three-headed Slavic deity or a trinity of deities, and is also the name of a famous peak in Slovenia, which is, however, some distant.

====Plot====

Voyslava and her father Mstivoy, the Prince of Retra, have poisoned Mlada, the betrothed of Yaromir, Prince of Arkona. Voyslava sells her soul to Morena, an evil goddess, to obtain her aid in making Yaromir forget Mlada so she may have him to herself. In act 3, the shade (ghost) of Mlada leads Yaromir up the slopes of Mount Triglav to a pine wood in a gorge on top of the mountain. Mlada&#x27;s shade joins a gathering of the spirits of the dead. She expresses in mime to Yaromir the wish to be reunited with him in the kingdom of dead souls. He is eager to join her. However, there is a rumbling sound announcing the appearance, apparently from underground, of the following fantastic characters (many of whom also appear in &quot;Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad&quot; from &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot;, described below):

The evil spirits sing in a strange demonic language, in the manner of the &quot;demons and the damned&quot; of Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;. Morena calls on Chernobog to help make Yaromir forsake Mlada. Kashchey determines that Morena and Chernobog will be successful if Yaromir is seduced by another. Chernobog commands Yaromir&#x27;s soul to separate from his body, and for Queen Cleopatra to appear. Instantly the scene changes to a hall in Egypt, where the shade of Cleopatra attempts to entice Yaromir&#x27;s soul to her side with a seductive dance. She almost succeeds in doing so when a cock crow announcing the break of day causes the entire infernal host to vanish. Yaromir awakens and ponders the mysterious events he has witnessed.

==&quot;Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad&quot; from &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot; (1880)==

===Composition history===
The work&#x27;s &quot;third version&quot;, the &quot;Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad&quot; (, &quot;Sonnoye videniye parobka&quot;), was composed eight years later when Mussorgsky revived and revised the second version to function as a &quot;dream intermezzo&quot; in his opera &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot; (1874–80), a work which was still incomplete at the time of his death in 1881. Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano-vocal score is dated 10 May 1880.

Mussorgsky originally chose the end of act 1 of the opera as the location for his choral intermezzo. It is now generally performed in the Shebalin version (1930) of the opera, where it is relocated to act 3, just after a partial reprise of the peasant lad&#x27;s dumka. The theme of the dumka also serves as one of the main themes of the new quiet ending.

===Performance history===
The &quot;Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad&quot; was first performed as part of Vissarion Shebalin&#x27;s performing edition of &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot;, which premiered in 1931 in Leningrad at the Maly Theater, conducted by Samuil Samosud. Shebalin&#x27;s orchestration was published by Muzgiz () in 1934.

===Program===
====Setting====

&quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot; is set in and around the Ukrainian village of Velyki Sorochyntsi, some 500 kilometers east of Kyiv and the famous &quot;Bald Mountain&quot; (Lysa Hora), in the year 1800.

====Plot====

The peasant Solopiy Cherevik, his domineering wife Khivrya, and pretty daughter Parasya are visiting the Sorochyntsi Fair. Parasya is wooed by Gritsko Golopupenko, the &quot;peasant lad&quot; of the title. Gritsko desires Cherevik&#x27;s consent to marry his daughter. Although Cherevik is not against the match, his wife objects because Gritsko had thrown mud in her face on the way to the fair. Gritsko strikes a bargain with a gypsy to assist him in winning Parasya. They exploit the superstitious fears of the fairgoers, who believe that the location of the fair this year is ill-chosen, it being the haunt of a devil who was thrown out of hell, took to drinking, went broke, pawned his jacket, and has returned to claim it. After various pranks and comic circumstances, Gritsko achieves his goal and all ends happily.

At the end of act 1, Gritsko falls asleep some distance from the fair, and, because there has been talk of devilry, has a dream of a witches&#x27; sabbath. The following remarks are taken from the score (page numbers supplied):
Act 1, scene 2 – &quot;Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad&quot; (Intermezzo)

:p. 1) A hilly desolate area. An approaching subterranean choir of infernal forces. The curtain rises. The peasant lad sleeps at the foot of a hill.
:p. 3) Witches and devils surround the sleeping peasant lad.
:p. 5) On a hill appear fiery serpents. The approach of Chernobog. Chernobog rises from underground. Following him are Kashchey, Cherv, Chuma, Topelets, Smert, and the rest of his retinue.
:p. 7) Worship of Chernobog.
:p. 10) Sabbath.
:p. 11) Ballet.
:p. 16) Stroke of a matins bell.
:p. 17) Satan and his retinue vanish. The scene is covered by clouds.
:p. 21) The peasant lad awakens and stands up, stretching and looking around wildly. The clouds disperse. The scene is illuminated by the rising sun.

Первое действие, вторая картина: «Сонное видение паробка» (Intermezzo)

:л. 1: Холмистая глухая местность. Подземный приближающийся хор адских сил. Занавес поднимается. У подножия холма спит Паробок.
:л. 3: Ведьмы и бесы окружают спящего паробка.
:л. 5: На холме показываются огненные змеи; приближение Чернобога. Из под земли поднимается Чернобог; за ним Кащей, Червь, Топелец, Чума, Смерть и прочая свита.
:л. 7: Служба Чернобогу.
:л. 10: Шабаш.
:л. 11: Балет.
:л. 16: Удар утреннего колокола.
:л. 17: Сатана и его свита исчезают. Сцена покрывается облаками.
:л. 21: Паробок просыпается и встает, потягиваясь и дико оглядываясь. Облака разбегаются. Сцена освещается восходящим солнцем.
Surviving the transfer from &quot;Glorification of Chernobog&quot; are the same supernatural characters, although Morena has been replaced by Death (, &quot;Smert&quot;&#x27;). Chernobog and his accomplices form a kind of Six Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The demon language the characters sing, of which Mussorgsky was contemptuous in a letter, is preserved.

Mussorgsky sent the following program to Vladimir Stasov about three months after its composition in 1880:
The peasant lad sleeps at the foot of a hillock at some distance from the hut where he should have been. In his sleep appear to him:

#Subterranean roar of non-human voices, uttering non-human words.
#The subterranean kingdom of darkness comes into its own—mocking the sleeping peasant lad.
#Foreshadowing of the appearance of Chernobog (Satan).
#The peasant lad left by the spirits of darkness. Appearance of Chernobog.
#Worship of Chernobog and the black mass.
#Sabbath.
#At the wildest moment of the sabbath the sound of a Christian church bell. Chernobog suddenly disappears.
#Suffering of the demons.
#Voices of the clergy in church.
#Disappearance of the demons and the peasant lad&#x27;s awakening.

Паробок спит у подножия пригорка, далеко, вдали от хаты, куда бы должен попасть. Во сне ему мерещатся:

#Подземный гул нечеловеческих голосов, произносящих нечеловеческие слова.
#Подземное царство тьмы входит в свои права – трунит над спящим Паробком.
#Предзнамение появления Чернобога (Сатаны).
#Паробок оставлен духами тьмы. Появление Чернобога.
#Величание Чернобога и Черная служба.
#Шабаш.
#В самом разгаре шабаша удар колокола христианской церкви. Чернобог исчезает мгновенно.
#Страдания бесов.
#Голоса церковного клира.
#Исчезновение бесов и пробуждение Паробка.

==Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s fantasy: &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; (1886)==
===Composition history===
In the years after Mussorgsky&#x27;s death, his friends prepared his manuscripts for publication and created performing editions of his unfinished works to enable them to enter the repertoire. The majority of the editorial work was done by Rimsky-Korsakov, who in 1886 produced a redacted edition of &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; from the &quot;Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad&quot; vocal score. Rimsky-Korsakov discusses his work on the piece, designated a &quot;fantasy for orchestra&quot;, in his memoirs, &quot;Chronicle of My Musical Life&quot; (1909):
During the season of 1882/83, I continued working on &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; and other compositions of Mussorgsky&#x27;s. &quot;A Night on Bald Mountain&quot; was the only thing I could not find my way with. Originally composed in the sixties under the influence of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (Totentanz) for the piano with accompaniment of orchestra, this piece (then called &quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot;, and both severely and justly criticized by Balakirev) had long been utterly neglected by its author, gathering dust among his unfinished works. When composing Gedeonov&#x27;s &quot;Mlada&quot;, Mussorgsky had made use of the material to be found in &quot;Night&quot;, and, introducing singing into it, had written the scene of Chernobog on Mount Triglav. That was the second form of the same piece in substance. Its third form had developed in his composing of &quot;Sorochintsï Fair&quot;, when Mussorgsky conceived the queer and incoherent idea of making the peasant lad, without rhyme or reason, see the sabbath of devilry in a dream, which was to form a sort of stage intermezzo that did not chime at all with the rest of the scenario of &quot;Sorochintsy Fair&quot;. This time the piece ended with the ringing of the village church bell, at the sounds of which the frightened evil spirits vanished. Tranquility and dawn were built on the theme of the peasant lad himself, who had seen the fantastic dream. In working on Mussorgsky&#x27;s piece, I made use of its last version for the purpose of closing the composition. Now then, the first form of the piece was for piano solo with orchestra; the second form and the third, vocal compositions and for the stage, into the bargain (unorchestrated). None of these forms was fit to be published and performed. With Mussorgsky&#x27;s material as a basis, I decided to create an instrumental piece by retaining all of the author&#x27;s best and coherent material, adding the fewest possible interpolations of my own. It was necessary to create a form in which Mussorgsky&#x27;s ideas would mould in the best fashion. It was a difficult task, of which the satisfactory solution baffled me for two years, though in the other works of Mussorgsky I had got on with comparative ease. I had been unable to get at either form, modulation, or orchestration, and the piece lay inert until the following year.

«В сезоне 1882/83 года я продолжал работу над «Хованщиной» и другими сочинениями Мусоргского. Не давалась мне только «Ночь на Лысой горе». Сочиненная первоначально в 60-х годах под влиянием листовского «Danse macabre» для фортепиано с сопровождением оркестра, пьеса эта (называвшаяся в то время «Ивановой ночью» и подвергшаяся суровой и справедливой критике Балакирева) была надолго совершенно заброшена автором и лежала без движения среди его «inachevé». При сочинении гедеоновской «Млады» Мусоргский воспользовался имеющимся в «Ночи» материалом и, введя туда пение, написал сцену Чернобога на горе Триглаве. Это был второй вид той же пьесы по существу. Третий вид ее образовался при сочинении «Сорочйнской ярмарки», когда Мусоргскому пришла странная и несуразная мысль заставить парубка, ни с того ни с сего, увидеть шабаш чертовщины во сне, что должно было составить некое сценическое интермеццо, отнюдь не вяжущееся со всем остальным сценариумом «Сорочинской ярмарки». На этот раз пьеса оканчивалась звоном колокола деревенской церкви, при звуках которого испуганная нечистая сила исчезала. Успокоение и рассвет были построены на теме самого парубка, видевшего фантастическое сновидение. При работе над пьесой Мусоргского я воспользовался последним вариантом для заключения сочинения. Итак, первый вид пьесы был solo фортепиано с оркестром, второй и третий вид – вокальное произведение, и притом сценическое (не оркестрованное). Ни один из видов этих не годился для издания и исполнения. Я решился создать из материала Мусоргского инструментальную пьесу, сохранив в ней все, что было лучшего и связного у автора, и добавляя своего по возможности менее. Надо было создать форму, в которую уложились бы наилучшим способом мысли Мусоргского. Задача была трудная, удовлетворительно разрешить которую мне не удавалось в течение двух лет, между тем как с другими сочинениями Мусоргского я справился сравнительно легко. Не давались мне ни форма, ни модуляции, ни оркестровка, и пьеса лежала без движения до следующего года.»

Rimsky-Korsakov made &quot;corrections&quot; typical of him, as he did with &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;, and was later to do with &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, preserving the general thematic structure, but adding or omitting bars, and making modifications to melody, harmony, rhythm, and dynamics.

===Performance history===

Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s edition was completed in 1886, and published in the same year by V. Bessel and Co. It received its premiere on 15 October 1886 in St. Petersburg&#x27;s Kononov Hall, performed by the orchestra of the Russian Symphony Concerts. Rimsky-Korsakov conducted the performance himself, and gives the following account of it in his memoirs, &quot;Chronicle of My Musical Life&quot; (1909):

The orchestration of &quot;A Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, which had baffled me so long, was finished for the concerts of [the 1886/87] season, and the piece, given by me at the first concert in a manner that could not be improved upon, was demanded again and again with unanimity. Only a tam-tam had to be substituted for the bell; the one I selected at the bell-store proved to be off pitch in the hall, owing to a change in temperature.

The Western European premiere performance of his edition was likely the one described further on:

In the summer of 1889, the Paris Universal Exposition took place. Belyayev decided to give there two symphonic concerts of Russian music at the Trocadéro, under my direction... The concerts were set for Saturdays 22 and 29 June, new style. Upon our arrival in Paris, rehearsals commenced. The orchestra, which proved to be excellent, the men being amiable and painstaking, had been borrowed from Colonne. Their playing in the concerts was fine... The success was considerable, with plenty of applause, but the attendance was not large.

&quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; was performed at the second concert, on 29 June 1889, where it followed Borodin&#x27;s &#x27;Polovtsian Dances&#x27; and &#x27;Polovtsian March&#x27; from &quot;Prince Igor&quot; in the second half of the program. Rimsky-Korsakov later mentions another performance of the piece, taking place on 25 April 1890, at the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels.
===Instrumentation===
*&quot;Strings:&quot; violins, violas, cellos, double basses, harp
*&quot;Woodwinds:&quot; piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons
*&quot;Brass:&quot; 4 French horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba
*&quot;Percussion:&quot; timpani, bass drum, cymbals, tam-tam, bell

===Program===
The following program is printed in Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s edition of &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, published in 1886 by V. Bessel and Co.:

Subterranean sounds of non-human voices. Appearance of the spirits of darkness, followed by that of Chernobog. Glorification of Chernobog and Black Service. Sabbath. At the height of the sabbath, the distant ringing of a village church bell is heard; it disperses the spirits of darkness. Morning.
==Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s arrangement: &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; (1940)==
===Composition history===
Millions of 20th-century listeners owe their initial acquaintance with Mussorgsky&#x27;s tone poem to Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s version, specially produced for Walt Disney&#x27;s 1940 film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Stokowski stated that he based it on the Rimsky-Korsakov arrangement in form and content (though notably without the &quot;fanfare&quot; that marks the entrance of Chernobog), but on Mussorgsky&#x27;s original in orchestration. However, like Rimsky-Korsakov, Stokowski had no copy of the original tone poem from 1867, so he did what he felt Mussorgsky would have done, being somewhat familiar with Mussorgsky&#x27;s style. Stokowski had conducted the U.S. premiere of the original version of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in 1929, and subsequently produced a symphonic synthesis of &quot;Boris&quot; for concert purposes. Despite the success of &quot;Fantasia&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s orchestration remains the concert favorite, and the one most often programmed.

===Instrumentation===
*&quot;Strings:&quot; violins, violas, cellos, double basses, 2 harps
*&quot;Woodwinds:&quot; 2 piccolos, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 1 cor anglais, 1 E-flat clarinet, 2 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 1 contrabassoon
*&quot;Brass:&quot; 5 french horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 1 tuba
*&quot;Percussion:&quot; timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, xylophone, tam-tam, bell

==Other arrangements==

At the climax of the 1939 film version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, an arrangement of the piece is heard, while the Wicked Witch of the West pursues Dorothy Gale and her friends. 

David Shire arranged an orchestral disco adaptation, &quot;Night on Disco Mountain&quot;, for the 1977 motion picture &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. The arrangement was released as part of the film&#x27;s soundtrack. &quot;Night on Disco Mountain&quot; is based on the first portion of Mussorgsky&#x27;s composition, complementing the composer&#x27;s unusual selection of instruments with &quot;wah-wah electric guitar solo, synthesized bells, a constantly throbbing electric bass, hi-hat, snare drum, and a variety of exotic bongos and percussion instruments&quot;, &quot;various studio sound effects&quot;, and &quot;an otherworldly synthesized chorus&quot;.

The German progressive thrash metal band Mekong Delta features a cover of the piece on their fourth studio album, &quot;Dances of Death (and Other Walking Shadows)&quot;.

The piece plays in &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; episodes &quot;Space Madness&quot;, &quot;Stimpy&#x27;s Invention&quot; and &quot;Ren&#x27;s Bitter Half.&quot;

The second main level of &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; (&quot;What the Heck?&quot;) opens with this theme.

The Nintendo game &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot; has a version of the song called &quot;Haunted Chase&quot; in the level &quot;Haunted Hall&quot;. 

Yoko Shimomura arranged a version of the piece for the international release of the 2002 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Re-arrangements of that version were then used in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix&quot;.

A section of the piece is found in the 2014 video game &quot;&quot; during the final boss fight with the villain Kaos.

A version of the piece was arranged for the game &quot;The End Is Nigh&quot; titled &quot;Golgotha – Night On Bald Mountain (Mussorgsky 1867)&quot; by video game composer team Ridiculon (Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans).

The Russian dancer and choreographer Igor Moiseyev also created a piece from variations of the same theme.

The piece appears in the 2022 film &quot;Babylon&quot;.

The piece from &quot;Fantasia&quot; once again returns in the 2023 short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

<doc id="502904" wikidata="Q2079909" url="?curid=502904" title="Province of Massachusetts Bay">
<text>The Province of Massachusetts Bay was a colony in New England which became one of the thirteen original states of the United States. It was chartered on October 7, 1691, by William III and Mary II, the joint monarchs of the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and was based in the merging of several earlier British colonies in New England. The charter took effect on May 14, 1692, and included the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Plymouth Colony, the Province of Maine, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Nantucket, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick; the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is the direct successor. Maine has been a separate state since 1820, and Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are now Canadian provinces, having been part of the colony only until 1697.

The name Massachusetts comes from the Massachusett Indians, an Algonquian tribe. It has been translated as &quot;at the great hill&quot;, &quot;at the place of large hills&quot;, or &quot;at the range of hills&quot;, with reference to the Blue Hills and to Great Blue Hill in particular.

==History==

Colonial settlement of the shores of Massachusetts Bay began in 1620 with the founding of the Plymouth Colony. Other attempts at colonization took place throughout the 1620s, but expansion of English settlements only began on a large scale with the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 and the arrival of the first large group of Puritan settlers in 1630. Over the next ten years, there was a major migration of Puritans to the area, leading to the founding of a number of new colonies in New England. By the 1680s, the number of New England colonies had stabilized at five: the Connecticut Colony, the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and the Province of New Hampshire all bordered the area surrounding Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth. Massachusetts Bay, however, was the most populous and economically significant, hosting a sizable merchant fleet.

The colonies had struggles with some of the Indigenous inhabitants. The Pequot tribe was virtually destroyed in the Pequot War during the 1630s, and King Philip&#x27;s War in the 1670s decimated the Narragansetts in southern New England. King Philip&#x27;s War was also very costly to the colonists of New England, putting a halt to expansion for several years.

Massachusetts and Plymouth were both somewhat politically independent from England in their early days, but this situation changed after the restoration of Charles II to the English throne in 1660. Charles sought closer oversight of the colonies, and he tried to introduce and enforce economic control over their activities. The Navigation Acts passed in the 1660s were widely disliked in Massachusetts, where merchants often found themselves trapped and at odds with the rules. Charles II also viewed Massachusetts&#x27; issuing of coins as a treasonous act. However, many colonial governments did not enforce the acts themselves, particularly Massachusetts, and tensions grew when Charles revoked the first Massachusetts Charter in 1684.

In 1686, Charles II&#x27;s successor James II formed the Dominion of New England which ultimately created a single political unit out of the British territories from Delaware Bay to Penobscot Bay. Dominion governor Edmund Andros was highly unpopular in the colonies, but he was especially hated in Massachusetts where he angered virtually everyone by rigidly enforcing the Navigation Acts, vacating land titles, appropriating a Puritan meeting house as a site to host services for the Church of England, and restricting town meetings, among other sundry complaints. James was deposed in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, whereupon Massachusetts political leaders rose up against Andros, arresting him and other English authorities in April 1689. This led to the collapse of the Dominion, as the other colonies then quickly reasserted their old forms of government.

The Plymouth colony never had a royal charter, so its governance had always been on a somewhat precarious footing. The Massachusetts colonial government was re-established but it no longer had a valid charter, and some opponents of the old Puritan rule refused to pay taxes and engaged in other forms of protest. Provincial agents traveled to London where Increase Mather was representing the old colony leaders, and he petitioned William III and Mary II to restore the old colonial charter. The king refused, however, when he learned that this might result in a return to the religious rule. Instead, the Lords of Trade combined the colonies of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay into the Province of Massachusetts Bay. They issued a charter for the Province on October 7, 1691, and appointed William Phips as its governor.

==Provincial charter==
The new charter differed from the old one in several important ways. One of the principal changes was inaugurated over Mather&#x27;s objection, changing the voting eligibility requirements from religious qualifications to land ownership. The effect of this change has been a subject of debate among historians, but there is significant consensus that it greatly enlarged the number of men eligible to vote. The new rules required prospective voters to own £40 worth of property or real estate that yielded at least £2 per year in rent; Benjamin Labaree estimates that this included about three-quarters of the adult male population at the time. The charter also guaranteed freedom of worship, but only for non-Catholic Christians.

The second major change was that senior officials of the government were appointed by the crown instead of being elected, including governor, lieutenant governor, and judges. The legislative assembly (or General Court) continued to be elected, however, and was responsible for choosing members of the Governor&#x27;s Council. The governor had veto power over laws passed by the General Court, as well as over appointments to the council. These rules differed in important ways from the royal charters enjoyed by the other New England colonies. The most important were that the General Court now possessed the powers of appropriation, and that the council was locally chosen and not appointed by either the governor or the Crown. These significantly weakened the governor&#x27;s power, which became important later in provincial history.

The province&#x27;s territory was also greatly expanded beyond that originally claimed by the Massachusetts and Plymouth colonies. Their territories initially included mainland Massachusetts, western Maine, and portions of New Hampshire; this territory was expanded to include Acadia or Nova Scotia (then encompassing Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and eastern Maine), as well as what was known as Dukes County in the Province of New York, consisting of Nantucket, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and the Elizabeth Islands.

== Colonial era ==
In the aftermath of the revolt against Andros, colonial defenses had been withdrawn from the frontiers, which were then repeatedly raided by French and Indigenous forces from Canada and Acadia. Queen Anne&#x27;s War broke out in 1702 and lasted until 1713. Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley organized the colonial defenses, and there were fewer raids than previously. Dudley also organized expeditions in 1704 and 1707 against Acadia, a haven for French privateers, and he requested support from London for more ambitious efforts against New France. In 1709, Massachusetts raised troops for an expedition against Canada that was called off; troops were again raised in 1710, when the Acadian capital of Port Royal was finally captured.

Because of these wars, the colony had issued paper currency whose value was constantly in decline, leading to financial crises. This led to proposals to create a bank that would issue notes backed by real estate, but Governor Dudley and his successor Samuel Shute both opposed the idea. Dudley, Shute, and later governors fruitlessly attempted to convince the general court to fix salaries for crown-appointed officials. The conflict over salary reached a peak during the brief administration of William Burnet. He held the provincial assembly in session for six months, relocating it twice, in an unsuccessful attempt to force the issue.

In the early 1720s, the Indigenous Abenaki people of northern New England resumed raiding frontier communities, encouraged by French intriguers but also concerned over English encroachment on their lands. This violence was eventually put down by Acting Governor William Dummer in Dummer&#x27;s War, and many Abenakis retreated from northern New England into Canada after the conflict.

In the 1730s, Governor Jonathan Belcher disputed the power of the legislature to direct appropriations, vetoing bills that did not give him the freedom to disburse funds as he saw fit, and this meant that the provincial treasury was often empty. Belcher was, however, permitted by the Board of Trade to accept annual grants from the legislature in lieu of a fixed salary. The currency crisis flared up again during his administration, resulting in a revival of the land bank proposal which Belcher opposed. His opponents intrigued in London to have him removed and the bank was established, but its existence was short-lived, for an act of Parliament forcibly dissolved it. This turned a number of important colonists against crown and Parliament, including the father of American Revolutionary War political leader Samuel Adams.

The next 20 years were dominated by war. King George&#x27;s War broke out in 1744, and Governor William Shirley rallied troops from around New England for an assault on the French fortress at Louisbourg which succeeded in 1745. Louisbourg was returned to France at the end of the war in 1748, however, much to the annoyance of New Englanders. Governor Shirley was relatively popular, in part because he managed to avoid or finesse the more contentious issues which his predecessors had raised. The French and Indian War broke out in 1754, and Shirley was raised to the highest military command by the death of General Edward Braddock in 1755. He was unable to manage the large-scale logistics that the war demanded, however, and was recalled in 1757. His successor Thomas Pownall oversaw the remainder of the war, which ended in 1760.

==American Revolution==

The 1760s and early 1770s were marked by a rising tide of colonial frustration with London&#x27;s policies and with the governors sent to implement and enforce them. Both Francis Bernard and Thomas Hutchinson, the last two non-military governors, were widely disliked over issues large and small, notably Parliament&#x27;s attempts to impose taxes on the colonies without representation. Hutchinson was a Massachusetts native who served for many years as lieutenant governor, yet he authorized quartering British Army troops in Boston, which eventually precipitated the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. By this time, Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, John Hancock, and others were actively opposing crown policies.

Parliament passed the Townshend Acts in 1767 and 1768 which the Americans referred to as the Intolerable Acts, and the Massachusetts General Court authorized a circular letter denouncing them as unconstitutional. Royal Governor Francis Bernard demanded that the General Court rescind the letter but they refused, so he dissolved it, which led to widespread violence and rioting throughout Boston. Royal officers fled to Castle William and the Crown authorized more troops to be sent to Massachusetts. The Sons of Liberty stated that they were prepared to take up armed resistance to the Royal Authorities, while more conservative elements of society desired a peaceful political solution.

Boston citizens resolved at a town meeting to have the towns of Massachusetts assemble in a convention, and delegates met at Faneuil Hall for six days in September, with Thomas Cushing serving as chairman. Many Patriot leaders were calling for armed resistance by this time, but the more moderate factions of the convention won out and military action was voted down.

===Boston Tea Party===
The Sons of Liberty organized a meeting at the Old South Meeting House in Boston in 1773 in defiance of the Tea Act; thousands of people attended, and Samuel Adams organized a protest at Boston Harbor. Colonists stormed ships in the harbor and dumped the cargo of tea into the water, and the protest came to be known as the Boston Tea Party. General Thomas Gage replaced Hutchinson as royal governor in May 1774. He was well received at first, but his reputation rapidly became worse with the Patriots as he began to implement the Intolerable Acts, which included the Massachusetts Government Act, dissolved the legislature, and closed the port of Boston until reparations were paid for the dumped tea. The port closure did great damage to the Massachusetts economy and led to a wave of sympathetic assistance from other colonies.

The Intolerable Acts only increased the crisis in New England, as Boston colonists insisted that their constitutional rights were being destroyed. The New England colonies had democratic control of their own governments, dating back to the founding of Plymouth Colony in 1620. The General Court lacked executive authority and authority over the militia, yet it still held significant power. The colonists had control over the treasury and spending and could pass laws. Anything passed by the assembly was subject to veto by the Royal Governor, but the General Court held control over spending and could withhold the pay of the Royal officials as leverage. This resulted in the Royal Governor being little more than a figurehead.

The royal government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay existed until early October 1774, when members of the General Court met in contravention of the Massachusetts Government Act and established the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, which became the &quot;de facto&quot; government. Governor Gage continued an essentially military authority in Boston, but the provincial congress governed the rest of Massachusetts.

===American Revolutionary War===

War finally erupted in April 1775 at Lexington and Concord, which started the American Revolutionary War and the Siege of Boston. The British evacuated Boston on March 17, 1776, ending the siege and bringing the city under Patriot control.

On May 1, 1776, the General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring independence in the name of &quot;The Government and People of the Massachusetts Bay in New England&quot;. This was followed by the United States Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, declaring the independence of all Thirteen Colonies.

=== Provincial Congress ===
Passage of the Massachusetts Government Act resulted in the dissolution of the General Court, so the colonists held conventions throughout Massachusetts. These conventions were organized by county and had delegates from each town. Each convention drafted resolutions which were to be sent to the Royal Governor in Boston; these differed from county to county, yet they had many similar themes and sentiments. The delegates insisted on reinstatement of their constitutional government, which had existed since the Mayflower Compact of 1620 and was reiterated in the Charter of the Massachusetts Bay Company and the Massachusetts Charter. They declared their allegiance to King George III, but they stated that they would be absolved of that allegiance if he did not restore their constitutional rights and privileges. They declared that they would resist with force if those rights were not restored, and this included the total boycott of British goods, the disruption of local courts, and the kidnapping of royal officials.

Delegates from all the counties of Massachusetts met in Salem in October 1774 to reform their dissolved assembly. This new congress was to be the resumption of their constitutional government and a repudiation of the royal one in Boston. The congress selected John Hancock as its first president (then called chairman) and Benjamin Lincoln as clerk, and they installed judges, tax collectors, constables, and other officials. They also assumed control of the militia and instructed all towns in Massachusetts to train troops and elect new officers. An executive standing committee and a Committee of Safety were also instituted to govern when Congress was not in session.

The Provincial Congress went through different formations in its six years of existence, with shifting structures of authority and types of governance. The executive standing committee was replaced in the Second Congress with a renewed Committee of Safety which acted as the &quot;de facto&quot; governmental authority, in charge of the militia and governance in between sessions. The third Congress brought a return to legislative supremacy and a decrease in power of the executive. Joseph Warren was elected as the congress&#x27; second president and James Warren as its third.

=== Forming the Commonwealth ===
Calls for a constitutional convention began when the Provincial Congress was declared in 1774. With the pressures of the war and political uncertainty these efforts were postponed. Berkshire County in the far western part of Massachusetts Bay was exceptionally vocal in its desire to form a new constitution. In a dispatch to the Provincial Congress the delegates of Pittsfield rejected not only the royal colonial authorities but also the legitimacy of the previous charters with which the Provincial Congress claimed its legitimacy. The letter stated that the only political legitimacy a state or constitution could find would be with the people of a province. With Massachusetts Bay declaring independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain in May 1776 the push for a newly codified constitution increased.

In September 1776 the General Court petitioned the towns of Massachusetts Bay to put forth a vote on whether or not a convention should be called. In 1777 it was agreed that a convention would be formed to draft a new constitution. The General Court, which consisted of the Governor&#x27;s Council and House of Representatives, decided to form a committee which would be tasked to write a constitution. In the winter of 1778 the General Court decided that the draft formulated from the constitutional committee would be put before the electorate of Massachusetts Bay and it would need to be accepted by 2/3rds of voters.

The first draft of the convention was rejected. In this first draft the state would consist of a legislature called the General Court which had two houses, a House of Representatives and an indirectly elected senate that would also serve as a governor&#x27;s council. The Governor would not have the power of veto and would need to have any action confirmed by the Senate. There were some progressive elements of the constitution however, the Senate would be apportioned based on population and the House would no longer have a property requirement. Also a point of contention was that there was no Bill of Rights. When the vote was put before the populace it was rejected by an 83% to 17% margin.

In 1779 another question was put to the electorate. This time the people were asked if they favored another convention, apportioned by population, to meet and formulate a new draft of the constitution. The question passed by a 72% to 28% margin. This next convention met from September 1, 1779, to June 16, 1780. At the time the war was not going well for the Patriot forces. The Penobscot Expedition had ended in failure, and the Kingdom of France had yet to send its larger contingent of military support. Even amidst the political uncertainty the convention was assembled with 312 members.

John Adams wrote the draft of the new constitution and the convention accepted it with minimal amendments. The draft was then put to the various town meetings of the province. The town meetings were to decide on the constitution in pieces, rather than as a whole, and add any changes they thought were necessary. The Adams version was then accepted by the convention on June 15, 1780. In elections held in October 1780, John Hancock was elected the first Governor of Massachusetts along with representatives to the commonwealth&#x27;s first General Court.

==Politics==

===Provincial politics===
The politics of the province were dominated by three major factions, according to Thomas Hutchinson, who wrote the first major history of colonial Massachusetts. This is in distinction to most of the other colonies, where there were two factions. Expansionists believed strongly in the growth of the colony and in a vigorous defense against French and Indian incursions; they were exemplified in Massachusetts by people such as Thomas Hancock, uncle to John Hancock, and James Otis, Sr. This faction became a vital force in the Patriot movements preceding the revolution. Non-expansionists were more circumspect, preferring to rely on a strong relationship with the mother country; they were exemplified by Hutchinson and the Oliver family of Boston. This faction became the Loyalists in the revolutionary era.

The third force in Massachusetts politics was a populist faction made possible by the structure of the provincial legislature, in which rural and lower class communities held a larger number of votes than in other provinces. Its early leaders included the Cookes (Elisha Senior and Junior) of Maine, while later leaders included revolutionary firebrand Samuel Adams. Religion did not play a major role in these divisions, although non-expansionists tended to be Anglican while expansionists were mainly middle-of-the road Congregationalist. Populists generally held either conservative Puritan views or the revivalist views of the First Great Awakening. Throughout the provincial history, these factions made and broke alliances as conditions and circumstances dictated.

The populist faction had concerns that sometimes prompted it to support one of the other parties. Its rural character meant that they sided with the expansionists when there were troubles on the frontier. They also tended to side with the expansionists on the recurring problems with the local money, whose inflation tended to favor their ability to repay debts in depreciated currency. These ties became stronger in the 1760s as the conflict grew with Parliament.

The non-expansionists were composed principally of a wealthy merchant class in Boston. They had allies in the wealthy farming communities in the more developed eastern portions of the province, and in the province&#x27;s major ports. These alliances often rivalled the populist party in power in the provincial legislature. They favored stronger regulation from the mother country and opposed the inflationist issuance of colonial currency.

Expansionists mainly came from two disparate groups. The first was a portion of the eastern merchant class, represented by the Hancocks and Otises, who harbored views of the growth of the colony and held relatively liberal religious views. They were joined by wealthy landowners in the Connecticut River valley, whose needs for defense and growth were directly tied to property development. These two groups agreed on defense and an expansionist vision, although they disagreed on the currency issue; the westerners sided with the non-expansionists in their desire for a standards-based currency.

===Local politics===
The province significantly expanded its geographical reach, principally in the 18th century. There were 83 towns in 1695; this had grown to 186 by 1765. Most of the towns in 1695 were within one day&#x27;s travel of Boston, but this changed as townships sprang up in Worcester County and the Berkshires on land that had been under Indian control prior to King Philip&#x27;s War.

The character of local politics changed as the province prospered and grew. Unity of community during the earlier colonial period gave way to subdivision of larger towns. Dedham, for example, was split into six towns, and Newburyport was separated from Newbury in 1764.

Town meetings also became more important in local political life. As towns grew, the townspeople became more assertive in managing their affairs. Town selectmen had previously wielded significant power, but they lost some of their influence to the town meetings and to the appointment of paid town employees, such as tax assessors, constables, and treasurers.

==Geography==
The boundaries of the province changed in both major and minor ways during its existence. There was very thin soil land, and a rocky terrain. Nova Scotia, then including New Brunswick, was occupied by English forces at the time of the charter&#x27;s issuance, but was separated in 1697 when the territory, called Acadia by the French, was formally returned to France by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick. Nova Scotia became a separate province in 1710, following the British conquest of Acadia in Queen Anne&#x27;s War. Maine was not separated until after American independence, when it attained statehood in 1820.

The borders of the province with the neighboring provinces underwent some adjustment. Its principal predecessor colonies, Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth, had established boundaries with New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, but these underwent changes during the provincial period. The boundary with New Hampshire was of some controversy, since the original boundary definition in colonial charters (three miles north of the Merrimack River) had been made on the assumption that the river flowed predominantly west. This issue was resolved by King George II in 1741, when he ruled that the border between the two provinces follows what is now the border between the two states.

Surveys in the 1690s suggested that the original boundary line with Connecticut and Rhode Island had been incorrectly surveyed. In the early 18th century joint surveys determined that the line was south of where it should be. In 1713 Massachusetts set aside a plot of land (called the &quot;Equivalent Lands&quot;) to compensate Connecticut for this error. These lands were auctioned off, and the proceeds were used by Connecticut to fund Yale College. The boundary with Rhode Island was also found to require adjustment, and in 1746 territories on the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay (present-day Barrington, Bristol, Tiverton and Little Compton) were ceded to Rhode Island. The borders between Massachusetts and its southern neighbors were not fixed into their modern form until the 19th century, requiring significant legal action in the case of the Rhode Island borders. The western border with New York was agreed in 1773, but not surveyed until 1788.

The province of Massachusetts Bay also laid a claim to what is now Western New York as part of the province&#x27;s sea-to-sea grant. The 1780s Treaty of Hartford saw Massachusetts relinquish that claim in exchange for the right to sell it off to developers.

<doc id="502906" wikidata="Q2524785" url="?curid=502906" title="Marcato">
<text>Marcato (short form: Marc.; Italian for &quot;marked&quot;) is a musical instruction indicating a note, chord, or passage is to be played louder or more forcefully than the surrounding music. The instruction may involve the word &quot;marcato&quot; itself written above or below the staff or it may take the form of the symbol ∧, an open vertical wedge. The marcato is essentially a louder and often shorter version of the regular accent &gt; (an open horizontal wedge).

Like the regular accent, however, the marcato is often interpreted to suggest a sharp attack tapering to the original dynamic, an interpretation which applies only to instruments capable of altering the dynamic level of a single sustained pitch. According to author James Mark Jordan, &quot;the &quot;marcato&quot; sound is characterized by a rhythmic &quot;thrust&quot; followed by a decay of the sound.&quot;

The instruction &quot;marcato&quot; or &quot;marcatissimo&quot; (extreme marcato), among various other instructions, symbols, and expression marks may prompt a string player to use martelé bowing, depending on the musical context. An example is the Gavotte in D major from J. S. Bach (Suzuki Book Volume 3) page 19, Bar 39.

<text>HMS &quot;Loch Fada&quot; was the lead ship of the s of the British Royal Navy, built by John Brown &amp; Company of Clydebank, Scotland, and named after Loch Fada in the Inner Hebrides.

The ship was laid down on 8 June 1943, launched on 14 December, and commissioned in April 1944. She was attached to Captain Johnny Walker&#x27;s 2nd Escort Group which was detailed to guard the Western Approaches of the British Isles. After the war she was attached to the Londonderry Flotilla until 1952.

Recommissioned in 1955, she operated in the Persian Gulf. After a period of fishery protection after the first &quot;Cod War&quot; between Great Britain and Iceland she served in the Far East from 1962, and supported operations during the Indonesian Confrontation. After decommissioning in 1969 she was used as a testbed in the development of Sea Wolf surface-to-air missiles, and was finally scrapped in 1970.

==Service history==

===World War II===
Commissioned in April 1944 &quot;Loch Fada&quot; joined the 2nd Escort Group at Plymouth in June after sea trials, and was deployed with the Group in anti-submarine operations during the Normandy landings (&quot;Operation Neptune&quot;). She took part in the sinking of the on 31 July, and also of and in early August. The Group was then released from anti-submarine operations and transferred to Derry to support of convoy defence in the North-West Approaches for the rest of the year.

In January 1945 the Group was deployed in the South-Western Approaches for anti-submarine support. On 27 February &quot;Loch Fada&quot; was involved in the sinking of the U-boat using depth charges near Penzance, Cornwall. Two hours earlier, &quot;U-1018&quot; had attacked convoy BTC 81 about seven miles from Lizard Point, Cornwall (at ). A torpedo hit the Norwegian freighter which sank within a few minutes, resulting in the death of five of the freighter&#x27;s Norwegian crew, a 16-year-old British cabin boy, Thomas Boniface, and two British Royal Navy gunners, (part of the DEMS gun crew) including former professional footballer Charlie Sillett.

After the German surrender in May 1945 the Group was transferred to the Home Fleet to support of the re-occupation of Norway.

===Londonderry, 1945–1952===
In July 1945 &quot;Loch Fada&quot; was transferred to the Anti-Submarine Flotilla for training duties, based at Derry. In December 1945 and January 1946, as part of &quot;Operation Deadlight&quot;, she escorted German U-boats from Loch Ryan out into the North-Western Approaches where they were sunk. The ship then returned to Derry. The Anti-Submarine Flotilla was renamed the 4th Escort Flotilla in September 1946, and to the 3rd Training Flotilla in early 1949. In early 1951 she took part in the search for missing submarine . In April 1952 &quot;Loch Fada&quot; was laid up at Portsmouth in Reserve.

===Upgrade and Persian Gulf, 1955–1961===
&quot;Loch Fada&quot; was one of seven members of her class selected for extensive modernisation in 1953. The single gun was replaced by the ubiquitous twin mounting HA/LA Mark XIX and the A/A weaponry was standardised as a single twin mounting Mark V and four single mounting Mark VII for the 40 mm Bofors gun, with a Simple Tachymetric Director shipped for the Mark V. Type 277 radar was fitted with the new ANU antenna array.

She was recommissioned on 21 July 1955 and joined the Home Fleet for exercises and port visits. In November she sailed from Portsmouth for service in the Persian Gulf based at Bahrain. There she carried out regular patrols and visits. In March 1956 &quot;Loch Fada&quot; was diverted from her usual patrol station and sent to Mombasa to embark Archbishop Makarios who was taken to Mahé, Seychelles, for detention because of his political activities. The ship then sailed to Colombo for a refit, before joining the East Indies Squadron in April for exercises. The ship then visited Cochin, Bombay and Karachi before returning to the Gulf in July. In September she was relieved by and returned to Portsmouth, arriving on 8 November.

After a refit, &quot;Loch Fada&quot; sailed from Portsmouth on 17 May 1957, arriving back at Bahrain on 4 July. In November and December she took part in a CENTO exercise off Karachi with , the cruiser , and ships of the Indian, Pakistani, Turkish and United States navies. In 1958 she resumed her Persian Gulf duties, and in March was sent to search for the Norwegian passenger ship which was on fire in Indian Ocean. The ship was carrying emigrants from Bremerhaven to Australia. The ship was found abandoned, and taken in tow, and after two days handed over to the Dutch tug &quot;Cyclops&quot;. &quot;Loch Fada&quot; then returned to the UK, arriving at Portsmouth on 14 May. After a refit the ship returned to Bahrain in December for the usual patrol duties. In July 1959 an inspection showed that extensive repairs were required and &quot;Loch Fada&quot; was withdrawn from service and returned to Portsmouth.

The ship returned to service in January 1960 attached to the 6th Frigate Squadron. In March and April she was deployed off Iceland on Fishery Protection duties. In June &quot;Loch Fada&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf patrol, with duties including patrolling tp stop gun running to rebels in Oman, capturing a dhow smuggling explosives, including 60 anti-tank mines on 16 July 1960. She took part in the CENTO &quot;Exercise MIDLINK II&quot; with warships of other nations in October and November. January 1961 saw her take part in an Amphibious Warfare &quot;Exercise ASPEX 7&quot; with and , and she was then deployed for Air-Sea Rescue duties in the Arabian Sea during the Royal Flight to India by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. She then cruised along the coast of East Africa calling at Mombasa, Tanga, Lindi, Mtwara and Dar es Salaam, before transiting the Suez Canal in April, to take part in the commemoration of the 20th Anniversary of the Siege of Tobruk, providing men for the ceremonial parade, and firing a Gun Salute for King Idris of Libya. She arrived at Chatham in June for an extensive refit which saw the installation of a centralised air conditioning system and modernisation of her radar, weapons and communications.

===Eastern Fleet, 1962–1967===
&quot;Loch Fada&quot; returned to service in June 1962 assigned to the 3rd Frigate Squadron of the Far East Fleet. She arrived at Colombo in October and was deployed in the Indian Ocean, calling at Diego Garcia and Malé, Maldives. From December until February 1963 she was deployed off Borneo to support of military operations during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation (the &quot;Konfrontasi&quot;). In March and April 1963 &quot;Loch Fada&quot; was deployed for a patrol in Pacific, calling at Manus in the Admiralty Islands, Suva in Fiji, Phoenix Island and Guam, before calling at Hong Kong and then several ports in Japan. She returned to Borneo in June to support military operations and on piracy patrol for the rest of the year.

In 1964 various patrols and exercises occupied the ship, including: &quot;Exercise JET&quot;, a multi-national exercise in the Indian Ocean in March, and amphibious exercises with the commando carrier , destroyer and oiler in May. From June to August she was assigned to Gulf patrol duties before returning to Singapore. There she remained for the remainder of her active career, patrolling off Borneo, and taking part in exercises. In September 1965 she was transferred to the 26th Escort Squadron when the 3rd Frigate Flotilla disbanded, but remained stationed at Singapore, periodically refitting at Hong Kong. In May 1967 she visited Japanese ports and took part in exercises. Finally in August she sailed for the UK, arriving back at Portsmouth on 11 October 1967, and was decommissioned and laid up in Reserve.

<text>Manuel Rodriguez (March 2, 1940 – November 28, 2012), better known as Spain or Spain Rodriguez, was an American underground cartoonist who created the character Trashman.

==Influences==
His experiences on the road with the motorcycle club, the Road Vultures M.C., provided inspiration for his work, as did his left-wing politics. Strongly influenced by 1950s EC Comics illustrator Wally Wood, Spain pushed Wood&#x27;s sharp, crisp black shadows and hard-edged black outlines into a more simplified, stylized direction. His work also extended the eroticism of Wood&#x27;s female characters. Robert Crumb and Rodriguez share influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;caF/msr/eD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
&quot;I would go back to Buffalo periodically and I would take photos. It’s interesting. Hardly any of those buildings are there now. My old neighborhood is a freeway interchange. Whenever I run into people from that time period they all remember those days. I thought it was me. I thought it was some personal quirk remembering Buffalo in those days but in Buffalo itself there’s a whole cult around that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cj/2012/msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; - Manuel &quot;Spain&quot; Rodriguez

Manuel Rodriguez was born March 2, 1940, in Buffalo, New York. He picked up the nickname Spain as a child, when he heard some kids in the neighborhood bragging about their Irish ancestry, and he defiantly claimed Spain was just as good as Ireland. Rodriguez studied at the Silvermine Guild Art School in New Canaan, Connecticut alongside cartoonist M.K. Brown.

&quot;When Manuel &quot;Spain&quot; Rodriguez ditched art school in 1959, the decision came easily. The Silvermine Guild School of Art professors didn’t appreciate his representational drawings, an alcoholic landlord threatened his life, and he’d witnessed a good friend commit suicide. So he returned to his hometown of Buffalo, New York, where he painted, took a janitor job (at the Western Electric plant for five years&lt;ref name=&quot;RRsb/msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), became invested in left wing politics, and joined an outlaw motorcycle gang. Rodriguez’s experiences as a member of the &quot;Road Vultures Motorcycle Club&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cw/1967/6/round-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bPD/rvMC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; later manifested in black-and-white illustrations when he moved to Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;hA/msr-Sexist&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

== Career ==

In New York City, during the late 1960s, he became a contributor to the underground newspaper the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, which published his own comics tabloid, &quot;Zodiac Mindwarp&quot; (1968). Trashman&#x27;s first appearance was as a full-page serial in the &quot;East Village Other&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;vimeo/49237109&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He covered the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago as a reporter for the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, adventures which were chronicled in &quot;My True Story&quot; (Fantagraphics Books, 1994). One of his earliest strips, &quot;Manning,&quot; featured a hard-boiled, over-the-top cop and was later cited as an influence on the British comics character Judge Dredd.

&quot;When I met him, he struck me as an archetypal character. Somewhere between a crazy artist crossed with a left wing radical, crossed with a working class Latino hood&quot; - Robert Crumb&lt;ref name=&quot;V/msr/RIP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain was a co-founder&lt;ref name=&quot;Ec/msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (with Nancy Griffith, Bill Griffith, Robert Crumb, Justin Green, Art Spiegelman, Roger Brand, and Michele Brand&lt;ref name=&quot;fiu/20231119/bG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) of the United Cartoon Workers of America,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabilliet/chACB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ha/ucwa&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The U.C.W. of A. brand appeared on a number of comix of that era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crumb/1972/XYZ&quot;&gt;
*cover&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In November 1970, Simon Deitch, Rory Hayes, and Spain Rodriguez organized a meeting at Rodriguez’s home to debate the foundation of a movement that could, if need be, attach itself to the IWW. From this first meeting came the name of the association, “United Cartoon Workers of America” (UCWA), but no other concrete decisions were made. The following month, over the course of a second meeting that assembled a greater number of participants with assistance from Rip Off Press, the creators placed their own status in underground publishing on the table. As independent creators, they circulated in a restricted network of small publishing houses, none of which realized any particularly elevated profits at the expense of the creators. In the eyes of some, like Roger Brand, this working situation did not justify the existence of a union. The third meeting was more didactic: Albert Morse, the lawyer for Zap Comix (and for Robert Crumb), wrote a report on the topic of royalties, Greg Irons explained how to buy art supplies in bulk, and Bill Griffith dissected the costs of printing and distribution. The creators present at this meeting agreed on a general page rate of twenty-five to thirty dollars a page, and on the royalties of about one thousand dollars for twenty thousand copies of a thirty-six-page comic book sold for fifty cents. Subsequent meetings took place but no union saw the light of day.&quot;

Spain contributed to numerous underground comics in the 1960s–2000s, including &quot;San Francisco Comic Book&quot;, &quot;Young Lust&quot;, &quot;Arcade&quot;, &quot;Bijou Funnies&quot;, &quot;Weirdo&quot;, and Harvey Pekar&#x27;s &quot;American Splendor&quot;. Spain joined the &quot;Zap Comix&quot; collective in issue #4 (August 1969), and contributed stories to every issue from then until the comic&#x27;s demise in 2005. In such classics as Spain&#x27;s &quot;Mean Bitch Thrills&quot; (Print Mint, 1971), Spain&#x27;s women are raunchy, explicitly sexual, and sometimes incorporated macho sadomasochistic themes.

&quot;Spain Rodriguez’s work stands above that of all the other male artists in this creation of sexually explicit comics art, both because he was so prolific and popular, and because he strove to show his sympathy toward women’s passions and struggles. Admittedly, he did so in ways that were distinctively his own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LArB/pb/msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The tall, leggy, often half-naked “Big Bitch” is a raunchy, explicitly sexual Rodriguez character who appears in &quot;She Comics&quot; in stories that often incorporate macho, sadomasochistic themes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UB/pd/msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving from New York City to San Francisco in 1970, Spain&#x27;s &quot;Subvert Comics&quot; series (1970–1976) featured &quot;three full length &quot;Trashman: Agent of the Sixth International&quot; stories.&quot; Trashman later appeared in such publications as &quot;High Times&quot;, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, &quot;Weirdo&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot; magazine, &quot;Zap&quot; #11–13, and the Fantagraphics anthology &quot;Zero Zero&quot; #2.

From 1976 to 1998, Spain contributed cover art to more than a dozen issues of the popular pornographic magazine &quot;Screw&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;caF/msr/Screw-627&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 to 1999, Spain drew the continuing graphic story, &quot;The Dark Hotel&quot;, which ran on the website &quot;Salon&quot;

Spain drew &quot;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; Strangest Cases&quot; based on Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories: &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb,&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual,&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Devil&#x27;s Foot,&quot; &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band,&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cartoonart/strangest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain&#x27;s later work included an illustrated biography of Marxist revolutionary Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, &quot;Che: A Graphic Biography&quot; (Verso Books, 2008). Published in several different languages, it was described by cartoonist Art Spiegelman as &quot;brilliant and radical.&quot; His history of the California farm worker movement, &quot;Farmworker Comix&quot; was published posthumously in 2014 by the California Federation of Teachers.

Spain designed at least five posters for the San Francisco Mime Troupe, a political satirist theatre company.

Rodriguez taught art classes at Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts for many years, and he supported the creation of murals in the Mission District. Spain did color xerox postcards and prints in the late &#x27;70s/early &#x27;80s at Galería de la Raza.&lt;ref name=&quot;ra/2013/msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Rodriguez married a daughter of Adele&lt;ref name=&quot;PP/nPx/r&amp;aSf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfG/rh/rs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Stern,&lt;ref name=&quot;cT/rs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Stern, a poet, an &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; and KPIX investigative journalist&lt;ref name=&quot;wk/2002/SS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in Boston and the San Francisco Bay Area,&lt;ref name=&quot;SS/kc-1980&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ndF/SS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the director of the films &quot;Barbie Nation: An Unauthorized Tour&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;sfC/sb/SS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs/BN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yT/Bn-UT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yT/Bn-UT-t&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Self-Made Man&quot; and &quot;Bad Attitude: The Art of Spain Rodriguez&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;v/SS/BA-t&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They have a daughter, a New York-based artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS/ss&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GG/ss&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;J/SS/bn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Susan&#x27;s documentary films are about her daughter&#x27;s dolls, her father, and her husband.

Rodriguez died at his home in San Francisco on November 28, 2012, after battling cancer for six years.

==Legacy==

In 2012, an anonymous seven-panel&lt;ref name=&quot;BN/esm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; graffiti tribute mural was spray-painted on a former warehouse and shipping platform of the Railway Express Agency owned by the City of Buffalo, near Buffalo Central Terminal and a package containing a CD of images and a note: &quot;Included are photos of an illegal mural – a dedication to Spain Rodriguez, located in Buffalo’s East-Side, at the Central Terminal, please use these photos and your powers to get the mural some shine … or just throw the CD out.&quot;, photos of which circulated on Facebook.&lt;ref name=&quot;BN/09605&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BPAC/msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, Ian De Beer directed a team of street artists to spray-paint a graffiti tribute mural in the style of Spain Rodriguez on a parking lot wall of a convenience store at Allen and College streets, in the Allentown, Buffalo neighborhood, inspired by a Spain Rodriguez comic about a fight he got into at a bar, across the street from the mural.&lt;ref name=&quot;bAH/idb-msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BN/first&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, &quot;Bad Attitude: The Art of Spain Rodriguez&quot; a documentary, was directed by his wife, filmmaker Susan Stern.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eg/msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RT/ba-msr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In July 2013, during San Diego Comic-Con, Rodriguez was one of six inductees into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame.

<text>HMS &quot;Loch Insh&quot; was a frigate of the Royal Navy, named after Loch Insh in Scotland. She was built by Henry Robb of Leith and launched on 10 May 1944. After service at the end of World War II she was decommissioned, but reactivated in 1950 and served, mostly in the Persian Gulf, until 1962. The ship was sold to the Royal Malaysian Navy in 1963 and renamed KD &quot;Hang Tuah&quot; (F433). She was scrapped in 1977.

==Service history==

===World War II===
After commissioning and sea trials &quot;Loch Insh&quot; joined the 19th Escort Group at Liverpool in November 1944. The Group was deployed for convoy defence in the North-West Approaches and the Irish Sea. For 14 hours on 6 December &quot;Loch Insh&quot; and hunted for the off Cape Wrath, but the U-boat, which had torpedoed the frigate and sent her to the bottom, escaped undamaged.

In January 1945 the Group was transferred to the English Channel for anti-submarine operations. In February it operated in the Irish Sea and South-Western Approaches, and in April was assigned to support the Russian convoys. On 18 April &quot;Loch Insh&quot; and 19 EG joined the escort for Russian Convoy JW 66, arriving at Kola Inlet on 25 April after an uneventful passage. After anti-submarine operations off the Russian coast, the Group departed with Convoy RA 66 for the return journey.

On 29 April, in the Barents Sea, &quot;Loch Insh&quot; sank using &quot;Shark&quot; anti-submarine projectiles and her Squid anti-submarine mortar, and the same day, with frigates and she sank . &quot;Loch Insh&quot; was detached from RA 66 with the other ships of 19 EG before their arrival in the Clyde and sent to Leith to refit and prepare for foreign service.

On 23 August she departed Rosyth to join the East Indies Escort Force, arriving at Colombo on 25 October. There she acted as escort to repatriation convoys. After a visit to the coast of East Africa, &quot;Loch Insh&quot; returned to the UK in April 1946 and was decommissioned and placed in Reserve at Devonport. Whilst in Reserve her pennant number was changed to F433.

===1950–1962===
After a refit &quot;Loch Insh&quot; was recommissioned on 21 September 1950 to serve with 6th Frigate Flotilla, Home Fleet, for exercises and visits. In April and May 1951 she joined to search for missing submarine .

In April 1952 she was decommissioned and was laid up at Devonport in readiness for a programme of extensive modernisation, of which &quot;Loch Insh&quot; would be the prototype for the rest of her class. The work finally began in May 1953 and took over a year. Recommissioned on 6 September 1954, she completed her sea trials in the Mediterranean, before arriving at Bahrain in December for duty in the Persian Gulf alongside . Her primary task was the protection of British tanker shipping, and she carried out a regular routine of patrols and port visits until returning to the UK in August 1955.

After a refit she returned to Persian Gulf patrol duty in March 1956. During the Suez Crisis (&quot;Operation Musketeer&quot;) &quot;Loch Insh&quot; was based at Bahrain where she protected Sitra Oil Jetties. In January 1957 she was relieved by , and returned to the UK via the Cape of Good Hope, as the Suez Canal was closed. She arrived back at Devonport in March to refit.

In March 1958, after anti-submarine training at Derry, she joined the Home Fleet for exercises and visits, and in June she returned to the Gulf. In October she joined other Royal Navy ships in the multi-national CENTO &quot;Exercise Midlink&quot; in the Indian Ocean, based at Karachi.

<text>HMS &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; was a frigate of the British Royal Navy. The ship was named after Loch Lomond in Scotland.

The ship was ordered from Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company, Dundee, Scotland on 2 February 1943, and laid down on 7 December 1943. Launched on 19 June 1944, and completed on 16 November 1944, the ship was commissioned soon after.

==Service history==

===World War II===
Attached to the 17th Escort Group from 11 December 1944, until May 1945 the ship patrolled the waters off Scotland and Northern Ireland, and in the English Channel escorting convoys. After V-E Day the ship was nominated for service in East Indies. After modifications she sailed on 28 June for Ceylon. In August she was set to take part in &quot;Operation Zipper&quot;, the recapture of British Malaya, though this was cancelled after the surrender of Japan. She remained at Singapore, supporting local operations until returning to the UK in April 1946 to be decommissioned.

While in reserve in 1948 her pennant number was changed to F437.

===1950-1959===
&quot;Loch Lomond&quot; was recommissioned on 22 September 1950 and served in the Mediterranean Fleet based at Malta, also seeing service in the Red Sea. She returned to the UK and was decommissioned on 21 October 1952.

She underwent modernisation between 1953 and 1955 before being recommissioned on 19 April 1955, returning to the Mediterranean Fleet, also seeing service in the Persian Gulf and as part of the East Coast of India Patrol. She returned to the UK in April 1956 to refit, sailing on 14 November for the Persian Gulf via the Cape of Good Hope, because of the closure of the Suez Canal. Duties in the Gulf and Indian Ocean occupied her until her return to the UK on 12 November 1957. Another major refit took up 1958 and most of 1959, before &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; was recommissioned in September.

===1960-1968===
&quot;Loch Lomond&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf in February 1960 for further patrols and exercises. The ship returned to the UK on 26 January 1961. In July she joined the 9th Frigate Squadron, returning to the Gulf in November. She then sailed to Singapore and joined the 3rd Frigate Squadron of the Far East Fleet on 18 October 1962.

In March 1963 she supported military operations in the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, the &quot;Konfrontasi&quot;, then served as Guard ship at Gan in the Maldives. Mr Abdulla Afeef Didi, the rebel leader of the Maldives and his family were transported to the British colony of Seychelles on Sunday, 29 September 1963 on board HMS Loch Lomond, reaching the destination on Friday, 4 October 1963. Exercises and patrol duties in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea occupied her until her return to the UK on 19 December 1964 for decommissioning.

Placed on the Disposal List in February 1965 she remained at Portsmouth until 1967 when she was taken to Chatham to be stripped of equipment before being sold for scrap in 1968.

<doc id="502919" wikidata="Q2816105" url="?curid=502919" title="Woodlawn, Chicago">
<text>Woodlawn is a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, located on and near the shore of Lake Michigan south of the Loop. It is one of the city&#x27;s 77 municipally recognized community areas. It is bounded by the lake to the east, 60th Street to the north, King Drive to the west, and 67th Street to the south, save for a small tract that lies south of 67th Street between Cottage Grove Avenue and South Chicago Avenue. Local sources sometimes divide the neighborhood along Cottage Grove into &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West Woodlawn.&quot;

Woodlawn contains a large portion of Jackson Park, including the site of the under-construction Barack Obama Presidential Center. The neighborhood is also home to a number of educational institutions: Hyde Park Career Academy, Mount Carmel High School, Chicago Theological Seminary, and the southern portion of the campus of the University of Chicago—including the Law School, the Harris School of Public Policy, the School of Social Service Administration, and the University of Chicago Press.

==Demographics==
Present-day Woodlawn is a predominantly African-American neighborhood. Per 2020 U.S. census data, the neighborhood&#x27;s racial makeup is 79.8% Black, 10.1% white, 3.6% Asian, and 3.1% Hispanic, with an additional 3.1% belonging to two or more races. There are demographic differences within Woodlawn, however: West Woodlawn is about 95% African-American, while East Woodlawn is significantly more diverse. The median household income in the neighborhood is $32,189, with 31.17% of residents living below the poverty line.

==History==
===Racial transition===
Up until 1948, Woodlawn was a middle class, white neighborhood, which grew out of the floods of workers and commerce from the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. During the first half of the century, many University of Chicago professors lived in Woodlawn. With the Supreme Court ruling outlawing racially restrictive covenants in 1948, the combination of the expanding African American urban population, their limited housing options, and exploitive real estate maneuvers that divided up apartments into kitchenettes, Woodlawn began to have its first African American residents. Cayton and Drake described the anxieties and clashes that took place at the edge of the ghetto in &quot;Black Metropolis&quot;. The play &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; is based on the experiences of author Lorraine Hansberry and her family, who were among the first to move in.

Like other communities bordering the ghetto, Woodlawn experienced intense bouts of white flight when the first African Americans moved into the neighborhood (especially the Washington Park Subdivision). Many institutions and people moved to the suburbs, a process that was facilitated by new federal housing loans. This combination of white flight from large apartments and high housing demand of the incoming African American population often proved lucrative for realtors, who routinely subdivided the vacated apartments. From this, buildings were over-filled with families. Absentee landlords seldom did much to maintain the buildings.

Others attempted to integrate this area but met with limited success. For example, the First Presbyterian Church (6400 South Kimbark Avenue) integrated in 1954 and, by the 1960s, had a markedly mixed character. However, older members often felt put out by the demographic and &quot;cultural&quot; changes that came with integration, and by the mid-1960s, the Church&#x27;s finances and membership rates were in trouble. For better or for worse, there had been an across the board change in the community.

===1960s===
By the early 1960s, Woodlawn was a predominantly African-American neighborhood with a population of over 80,000 people. 63rd Street was one of the busiest streets on the South Side and was famous for its jazz clubs. Despite its bustle, Woodlawn was an economically deteriorating community, and attempts to revive its citizenry were short-lived and fractured. The community escaped the riots that devastated the West Side after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. mainly because of the works of the Black P. Stone Nation in 1968. Nevertheless, most business owners fled. A rash of arsons destroyed a reported 362 abandoned buildings between 1968 and 1971.

===The University of Chicago===
In Hyde Park to the north, similar demographic and racial changes began in the 1950s but with radically different results. The University of Chicago, a large land owner with vested interest in the character of the neighborhood, fought through many avenues against what it saw as the encroachment of blight.

As Arnold Hirsch argues in his chapter &quot;Neighborhood on a hill&quot; in &quot;Making the Second Ghetto&quot;, the university, through the SECC and, at times, with brute force, made Hyde Park the site of one of the first &quot;urban renewal&quot; projects in the country. In an attempt to maintain the number of white families, the university tore down &quot;slum&quot; areas, often employing eminent domain powers. In the process, many African Americans were displaced from Hyde Park, and cultural centers like 55th Street were leveled.

After their success in Hyde Park, the university moved quickly to begin a second urban renewal project in Woodlawn. A one mile wide area from 60th to 61st in Woodlawn was scheduled for renewal and the university&#x27;s planned South Campus. The plans were drawn, there was a press conference, and the campus was eventually constructed.

At one time, the University of Chicago Law School raised more than $10,000 each year for charitable support for the children of Woodlawn. In 1999, however, it eliminated that support and shifted the funding to student scholarships for public interest jobs primarily outside the Chicago area.

==Community organizations==
===TWO (The Woodlawn Organization)===
The Woodlawn Organization coalesced around the perception that the university would pursue a land use policy in Woodlawn as it did in Hyde Park, and it has its roots in the pastors&#x27; Alliance of Woodlawn. Several years earlier, the Alliance had called in Saul Alinsky, founder of the Industrial Areas Foundation, to discuss plans to organize the community. But several major members of the Alliance at that time were displeased with Alinsky&#x27;s brashness and controversial direct tactics. In the initial years, when TWO was still under the IAF umbrella, Nicholas Von Hoffman, Alinsky&#x27;s second in command, planned most of the actions. After the university&#x27;s plans were known, several prominent churches gave the seed money for the organization, which began in 1961.

TWO, like other IAF organizations, was a coalition of existing community entities such as churches, business and civic associations. These member groups paid dues, and the organization was run by an elected board. The TWO moved quickly to establish itself as the &quot;voice&quot; of Woodlawn, mobilizing existing leadership and bringing up new leadership. A prime example of the newly empowered leadership in TWO was Reverend Arthur M. Brazier, who was the first spokesperson and eventual president. Brazier started out as a mail carrier, became a preacher in a store front church, and then, through TWO, burgeoned into a national spokesman for the black power movement. Brazier became a very powerful pastor in Chicago.

As Fish argues in &quot;Black Power/White Control&quot; TWO picked issues that mobilized resident participation, and at the same time built power for the organization to take on large outside entities like the university and the city (i.e. Mayor Daley). The group took part in the flurry of activity surrounding the Freedom Rides and the Civil Rights Movement by loading up over 40 buses of people from Woodlawn and riding to City Hall to register to vote. They also rallied against slum landlords and cheating business owners. TWO also took action on the university and were able to gain a seat on the City planning board (which stopped the university&#x27;s plans).

TWO faced continually worsening conditions in the neighborhood, and there are many arguments about its efficacy. Especially controversial was Brazier&#x27;s opposition to a planned and nearly completed Green Line extension to Dorchester, which forced the Chicago Transit Authority to tear down the nearly completed station and the tracks east of the Cottage Grove terminal and forfeit millions of dollars in federal funds in 1996.

===Woodlawn East Community And Neighbors Inc.===
As TWO moved to consolidate its position as the Voice of Woodlawn, other community organizations arose to deal with specific issues of housing and community empowerment, such as the arson fires that destroyed hundreds of buildings in Woodlawn in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Perhaps the most prominent of these organizations is Woodlawn East Community And Neighbors Inc. (WECAN) founded by Mattie C. Butler, a 40-year Woodlawn resident and sister of Hall of Fame R&amp;B singer/current Cook County Commissioner Jerry Butler.

Butler founded WECAN in October 1980 after watching 13 children die in an arson fire in a building next door to her home. WECAN quickly became a neighborhood and citywide advocate for rescuing at-risk and abandoned buildings, preserving an estimated 5000 units of housing in Woodlawn since its founding. Many of its programs - Abandoned Property Program, Vintage Homes For Chicago, Step-Up Housing - have become citywide models. WECAN was a founding member of the citywide Chicago Rehab Network of community developers. The organization and its founder, Mattie C. Butler, have been honored with local and national awards including the 1989 Petra Foundation Award and the 2008 Community Empowerment Advocate of the Year Award.

As the focus of development in Woodlawn has shifted toward new construction and condo conversion, WECAN is seen as a vocal advocate for affordable housing for low-moderate income residents and especially seniors. That stance has on occasion brought the organization into conflict with other groups in Woodlawn, particularly TWO, who have pushed for new development at what WECAN sees as the expense of current residents. WECAN led the opposition to the teardown of the 63rd Street CTA elevated line, a battle it lost. Woodlawn has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the city and is particularly affected by foreclosures of apartment buildings and condominium conversions.

WECAN sits on the New Communities Program Executive Steering Committee, operates 132 units of affordable housing, and operates supportive services, after school programs and its Housing Resource Center.

===Project Brotherhood===
Project Brotherhood is a health clinic focused on using community outreach and preventive education to meet the needs and improve the health of African American men in the Woodlawn area. The clinic is operated by a combination of staff, volunteers, and interns and hosts a variety of free services for members of the community. In the CNN documentary &quot;Black in America 2&quot;, Project Brotherhood was presented as one of America&#x27;s pioneers in terms of African American health.

===Gangs===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jeff Fort and Eugene Hairston ran a small gang of neighborhood kids centered near 66th and Blackstone called the Blackstone Rangers. By the mid-1960s, Fort and Hairston had pulled together twenty-one other local street gangs, thus becoming the dominant gang on Chicago&#x27;s South Side, engaging in numerous criminal activities while maintaining a political activist facade. For example, in 1966, in the midst of a violent drive to consolidate power and intimidate rivals, the Rangers provided security as Dr. Martin Luther King and the Congress On Racial Equality marched through hostile white neighborhoods like Cicero and Marquette Park.

Under the influence of both the Black Nationalist movement and the nonviolent civil rights movement, they changed their name to &quot;The Black Peace Stone Nation&quot;. During the riots in the aftermath of Dr. King&#x27;s assassination, the &quot;Stones&quot; were credited with preserving and protecting the Woodlawn neighborhood (albeit through extortion and intimidation), which saw minimal disturbance in contrast with neighborhoods like Garfield Park and the West Side.

Over time, the ties with the nonviolence movement faded as the gang&#x27;s name was altered to &quot;Black P. Stone Nation&quot; Hairston&#x27;s incarceration led Jeff Fort to take sole leadership of the gang, which by then stretched across numerous neighborhoods of the city and boasted as many as 50,000 members. During this time, the Stones became more political and more involved in community power structure. It even received funding from the US Office Of Economic Opportunity to run a job-training program in Woodlawn, the pilfering of which led Fort to another prison sentence.

While jailed, Fort was influenced by the Nation of Islam and upon his release renamed the gang again, to the El Rukn Tribe Of The Moorish Science Temple of America, usually shortened to &quot;El Rukn&quot; which means &quot;The Foundation&quot; in Arabic. The gang, whose home territory is in between the &quot;-Stone streets&quot; of Blackstone Avenue and Stony Island Avenue, are still a very strong force in the Woodlawn community.

==Present-day Woodlawn==
The area between 59th and 60th Streets is known as the Midway Plaisance, incorporating Midway Plaisance North (south of 59th Street) and Midway Plaisance South, north of 60th Street. Now dominated by a green space of low valleys, the Plaisance is widely known as the site of the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, in which the green space was to be designated as the Fair location (but was never utilized). The Plaisance is now a well-maintained walking and bike riding thoroughfare amidst the university&#x27;s campuses. Between 60th and 61st Streets (with Stony Island Avenue to the east and Cottage Grove Avenue to the west) are several of the university&#x27;s South Campus buildings including: University of Chicago Press, the law quadrangle and law library, the School of Social Service Administration, the Harris School of Public Policy Studies, the National Opinion Research Center, the Center for Research Libraries, Chapin Hall, and Granville-Grossman Residential Commons. Some of the university&#x27;s faculty and several hundred of its graduate and undergraduate students live south of 60th Street in University-owned real estate and dormitories, as well as in privately owned residences.

To replace the decaying Shoreland Hotel, the University of Chicago constructed a new residence hall on the corner of 61st St. and Ellis, designed with input from residents of both Hyde Park and Woodlawn so as to minimize possible alienation of the neighboring community.

=== Jackson Park ===
Jackson Park is a 500-acre (2 km) park on Lake Michigan in the neighborhoods of Woodlawn, Hyde Park, and bordering South Shore.

The land for Jackson Park was set aside in the 1870s. The area was originally a &quot;rough, tangled stretch of bog and dune&quot; until it was transformed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the architect of New York City&#x27;s Central Park. The park is connected by the Midway Plaisance to Washington Park on Woodlawn&#x27;s North end.

Jackson Park was the site of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. For this event, hundreds of acres of undeveloped park was turned into the spectacular, but temporary, Beaux-Arts &quot;White City.&quot; A small number of structures built for or used during the fair still remain in the park.

Attractions inside Jackson Park include Osaka Garden, the Jackson Park Golf Course, Jackson Park Harbor, Wooded Isle, the gilded Daniel Chester French statue Republic (a replica of a much larger statue built for the Columbian Exposition), several lagoons, and the 63rd Street Beach with its magnificent beach house.

==Education==
It is within Chicago Public Schools. Emmett Till Math &amp; Science Academy is in Woodlawn. Emmett Till, its namesake, was an alumnus of the school when it was called James McCosh Elementary School; in that period all of its students were African-American. It was given its current name in 2006.

<doc id="502920" wikidata="Q5633179" url="?curid=502920" title="HMS Locust (T28)">
<text>HMS &quot;Locust&quot; was one of 4 s of the Royal Navy, and was named after the locust, an insect. Launched on 28 September 1939 and commissioned on 17 May 1940, she survived the Second World War despite being severely damaged many times, including taking a shell hit during Operation Overlord.

==Service==
Designed as a Gunboat for the Yangtze River, she was equipped with two 4-inch guns; fore and aft, two 3-pounders each side, and a 3.5-inch howitzer midship plus a multi-barrel 2-pounder (40 mm) anti-aircraft gun. She was flat bottomed with a triple rudder configuration.

She participated in the Dunkirk evacuation during which she was attacked by German aircraft and evacuated 1,000 troops.

&quot;Locust&quot; had a central role in Operation Jubilee, the Dieppe Raid in August 1942, in which she was part of the &quot;Cutting Out Force&quot; that was to seize barges and trawlers and tow them back to England. She carried about 200 Royal Marine Commandos.

She served during Operation Overlord, during which she received a hit from shellfire. She survived the war, was recommissioned as a training vessel and eventually sold for scrap in 1968.

==Fate==
She was placed in reserve from 1946 until 1951 when she was converted to a drill ship for the Royal Naval Reserve and used for training. When moored next to the RNVR ship HMS Flying Fox in Bristol, the vessel&#x27;s shallow draught (essential for navigating shallow rivers) could be seen easily, around a foot or so below the waterline. Locust had three propellers and three large-bladed shallow rudders, equally spaced across its stern. She was decommissioned in 1968 and sold on 24 May 1968 to Cashmore for breaking. She was broken up in Newport.

<text>Sir Charles Galton Darwin (19 December 1887 – 31 December 1962) was an English physicist who served as director of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) during the Second World War. He was a son of the mathematician George Darwin and a grandson of Charles Darwin.

==Early life==
Darwin was born at Newnham Grange in Cambridge, England into a scientific dynasty. He was a son of mathematician Sir George Darwin and a grandson of Charles Darwin. His mother was Lady Darwin, Maud du Puy of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Darwin&#x27;s elder sister was the artist Gwen Raverat, and his younger sister Margaret married Geoffrey Keynes, the brother of the economist John Maynard Keynes. His younger brother William Robert Darwin was a London stockbroker. Darwin was educated at Marlborough College (1901–1906) and then studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1910, later promoted to MA by seniority.

==Career==
He secured a post-graduate position at the Victoria University of Manchester, working under Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr on Rutherford&#x27;s atomic theory. In 1912, his interests developed into using his mathematical skills assisting Henry Moseley on X-ray diffraction. His two 1914 papers on the dynamical theory of diffraction of X-rays from perfect crystals became often cited classics, minting the Darwin Curve of reflectivity. In a further paper of 1922, he introduced the mosaic crystal model.

On the outbreak of World War I, he was commissioned and sent to France as a censor. A year later William Lawrence Bragg had him transferred to the Royal Engineers to participate in the work on the localisation of enemy artillery by sound ranging. When that research was on a solid footing, he was transferred to the RAF to study aircraft noise. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1918.

From 1919 to 1922 he was a lecturer and fellow of Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he worked with R.H. Fowler on statistical mechanics and, what came to be known as, the Darwin–Fowler method. He then worked for a year at the California Institute of Technology before becoming the first Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in 1924, working on quantum optics and magneto-optic effects. He was the first in 1928, to calculate the fine structure of the hydrogen atom under Paul Dirac&#x27;s relativistic theory of the electron. He was assisted at the university by Dr Robert Schlapp.

In 1936 Darwin asked fellow physicist Max Born if he would consider becoming his successor as Tait Professor, an offer that Born promptly accepted. He then resigned his post in Edinburgh to become Master of Christ&#x27;s College, beginning his career as an active and able administrator, becoming director of the National Physical Laboratory on the approach of war in 1938. He served in the role into the post-war period, unafraid to seek improved laboratory performance through re-organisation, but spending much of the war years working on the Manhattan Project co-ordinating the American, British, and Canadian efforts.

Darwin was appointed KBE in 1942. In 1952, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==Private life==
In 1925, he married Katharine Pember, a mathematician and daughter of Francis William Pember. They had four sons and a daughter:
* Cecily Darwin (1926–2022) became an X-ray crystallographer and in 1951 married John Littleton of Philadelphia.
* George Pember Darwin (1928–2001) worked developing computers, and then (1964) married Angela Huxley, daughter of David Bruce Huxley. She was also a granddaughter of the writer Leonard Huxley and a great-granddaughter of Thomas Huxley, &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Bulldog&quot;.
* Henry Galton Darwin (1929–1992) was with the British Foreign Office, and married Jane Christie.
* Francis William Darwin (1932–1999) was a zoologist and taught at the University of London, and married in 1976.
* Edward Leonard Darwin (1934–2020) became a civil engineer.

In his spare time, Darwin also served as a wartime vice-president of the Simplified Spelling Society.

On his retirement, his attention turned to issues of population, genetics and eugenics. His conclusions were pessimistic and entailed a resigned belief in an inevitable Malthusian catastrophe, as described in his 1952 book &quot;The Next Million Years&quot;. He first argued in this book that voluntary birth control (family planning) establishes a selective system that ensures its own failure. The cause is that people with the strongest instinct for wanting children will have the largest families and they will hand on the instinct to their children, while those with weaker instincts will have smaller families and will hand on that instinct to their children. In the long run society will consist mainly of people with the strongest instinct to reproduce. This would ultimately have dysgenic effects.

In later years he travelled widely, an enthusiastic collaborator across national borders and an able communicator of scientific ideas.

He died at Newnham Grange in Cambridge (the house where he was born) on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1962/3; he was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium on 4 January 1963. He and his late wife are commemorated with a memorial at St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Cambridge; she was cremated, the funeral was in Wimbledon, where she had been living.

<text>HMS &quot;Lynx&quot; (F27), was a &quot;Leopard&quot;-class Type 41 anti aircraft frigate of the Royal Navy, named after the lynx.

She was laid down by John Brown &amp; Company, Clydebank, Scotland, on 13 August 1953, launched on 12 January 1955, and commissioned on 14 March 1957. On 12 March 1982 she was sold to the Bangladesh Navy and renamed BNS &quot;Abu Bakr&quot;. She was decommissioned and scrapped in 2014.

==Construction and design==
The &quot;Leopard&quot;-class, or Type 41, frigates were designed for a main role of providing anti-aircraft protection for convoys. As such they were provided with a heavy gun armament but did not require high speed. They shared a common hull and machinery with the (or Type 61) aircraft direction frigates.

&quot;Leopard&quot; was long overall, at the waterline and , with a Beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and deep load. She was powered by eight Admiralty Standard Range 1 (ASR1) diesel engines, with a total power of , driving two propeller shafts giving a speed of . Four more of these engines were used to generate electricity, driving 500 kW alternators. The ship had a range of at full power and at .

The ship&#x27;s main gun armament consisted of two twin 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark 6 dual-purpose gun turrets, mounted one forward and one aft, with a STAAG twin stabilised 40mm Bofors mount providing close-in anti-aircraft defence, although this mounting was unreliable and later replaced by a single Bofors gun. A single Squid anti submarine mortar was fitted. As built, &quot;Leopard&quot; was fitted with a Type 960 long-range radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast and Type 293Q surface/air search radar on the foremast. A Mark 6M fire control system (including a Type 275 radar) for the 4.5 inch guns was mounted above the ship&#x27;s bridge, with a secondary CRBF (Close-Range Blind Fire) director aft, fitted with Type 262 Radar, while the STAAG mount was fitted with its own Type 262 fire control radar. while a Type 974 navigation radar was also fitted. Type 965 long-range air search radar replaced Type 960 during a refit in 1964 and 1966, with Type 993 surface/air search and target indication radar replaced the Type 293Q. The ship&#x27;s sonar fit consisted of Type 174 search, Type 170 fire control sonar for Squid and a Type 162 sonar for classifying targets on the sea floor.

&quot;Lynx&quot; was laid down at John Brown &amp; Company&#x27;s Clydebank shipyard on 13 August 1953, was launched on 12 January 1955 by Mary, Princess Royal and commissioned on 14 March 1957, as the first of her class.

==Royal Navy service==
On commissioning &quot;Lynx&quot; served as the leader of the 7th Frigate Squadron, with the squadron alternating between service in home waters and on the South Atlantic Station. On 3 May 1960, &quot;Lynx&quot;, carrying out trials off Portsmouth, was diverted to search for survivors after a small fishing boat was sunk in a collision with the German tanker &quot;Caperata&quot;. In September 1964, with tensions heightening between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute, an Argentine light aircraft landed on Port Stanley racecourse, and its pilot, Miguel Fitzgerald, planted an Argentine flag and handed a written proclamation of Argentine sovereignty to an islander before flying back to Argentina. In response, &quot;Lynx&quot;, forming part of a task group off the coast of South America, was ordered to the Falklands, remaining there from 14 October to 11 November.

In March 1967, following the disbanding of the South Atlantic station, &quot;Lynx&quot; was the last Royal Navy ship based at the Simonstown naval base in South Africa, then transferring to the Far East. On 18 September 1970, &quot;Lynx&quot; found an abandoned long barge adrift off the coast of Johor, Malaysia and towed it back to Singapore. On 30 December 1972, the Japanese cargo ship &quot;Kyoryu Maru&quot;, carrying a cargo of timber from Selat Panjang to Singapore, sank after a collision with the Japanese tanker &quot;Shoen Maru&quot;, from Singapore. &quot;Lynx&quot;, on patrol off Singapore, took part in the search for nine missing crewmembers from &quot;Kyoryu Maru&quot;. &quot;Lynx&quot; was paid off in June 1974, and after a refit at Rosyth, joined the Standby Squadron at Chatham. She attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review off Spithead.

==Bangladeshi Navy service==

She was transferred to the Bangladeshi Navy 12 March 1982 and renamed BNS &quot;Abu Bakr&quot;. She was assigned to the Commodore Commanding BN Flotilla (COMBAN). About 200 personnel served aboard &quot;Abu Bakr&quot;, with most living aboard her.

In November 2008, BNS &quot;Abu Bakr&quot;  along with BNS &quot;Nirbhoy&quot; and BNS &quot;Madhumati&quot; intercepted Myanmar Navy ships at a disputed region of Bay of Bengal where they were supporting an exploration of oil and gas fields.

She was decommissioned during a ceremony held in her homeport Chittagong on 22 January 2014. She was replaced by a Chinese Type 053H2 frigate with the same name and pennant number.

<doc id="502937" wikidata="Q2627556" url="?curid=502937" title="HMS Mauritius (80)">
<text>HMS &quot;Mauritius&quot;, pennant C80, was a light cruiser of the Royal Navy. The ship was built by Swan Hunter, Newcastle upon Tyne. She was named after Mauritius, which was a British colony when she was built and entered service in 1941.

==Service==

&quot;Mauritius&quot; was completed with an internal degaussing system which induced severe corrosion to the ship&#x27;s fire main (made of copper); this major defect, which rendered her unfit for action, required refits, first at Simonstown, later at Singapore, and finally at Plymouth.
The future Admiral of the Fleet Henry Leach served as a midshipman aboard &quot;Mauritius&quot; during this time.
She joined the Eastern Fleet in 1942, but was withdrawn in April 1943 to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet. After repairs following grounding, she was operational in June 1943 and thereafter participated in the landings in Sicily, (Operation Husky), in July as a unit of Support Force East, when she carried out shore bombardment duties.

In September she was part of the covering force for the Salerno landings, but by the end of the year had been transferred to the Bay of Biscay to carry out anti-blockade-runner patrols, as part of Operation Stonewall. However, she soon returned to the Mediterranean, this time for Operation Shingle, the Anzio landings, in January 1944. In June 1944 she covered the landings in Normandy as part of Force D off Sword Beach, then carried out offensive patrols of the Brittany coast in August to mop up the remnants of the German shipping in the area. Operating with destroyers, she sank &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot; &quot;157&quot; on 14/15 August and during the Battle of Audierne Bay sank five &quot;Vorpostenboote&quot; on 22/23 August. After this she returned to the Home Fleet, covering the carrier raids along the Norwegian coast and making anti-shipping strikes. On the night of 27/28 January 1945, in company with the cruiser , she fought the action of 28 January 1945 with German destroyers in which was badly damaged. Following this action she was refitted at Cammell Laird&#x27;s between February 1945 and March 1946.

She then served in the Mediterranean, including passing through the Corfu Channel during the Corfu Channel Incident in 1946, with the 15th (later lst) Cruiser Squadron, returning to the UK in 1948. After a spell in reserve and in refit, she recommissioned in 1949 for the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean, sailing on 6 May 1949. The years 1949 to 1951 were spent on the East Indies Station with the 4th Cruiser Squadron until she returned to Chatham on 18 December 1951.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Mauritius&quot; was placed in reserve in 1952 and remained there until 1965, when she was sold for scrapping to Thos. W. Ward. She arrived at their yard at Inverkeithing, on 27 March 1965.

==Shore establishment==
HMS &quot;Mauritius&quot; was also the name of a Royal Navy shore establishment in Mauritius.

<text>Baron-sur-Odon () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Baronnais&quot; or &quot;Baronnaises&quot;.

The commune has been awarded one flower by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==
Baron-sur-Odon is located some 4 km south-west of Caen and 10 km north-east of Villers-Bocage. It is part of the urban area of Caen. Access to the commune is by the D89 from Tourville-sur-Odon in the north which passes through the village and continues south to Esquay-Notre-Dame. The D214 comes from Gavrus in the south-west and also passes through the village as well as Les Crettes and La Bruyère before continuing north-east to Fontaine-Étoupefour. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Tourmauville, Les Crettes, and La Bruyère. The commune is mostly farmland except for some forest in the north.

The river Odon forms the northern border of the commune as it flows north-east to join the Orne in Caen.

==Toponymy==
The name of the area is attested as &quot;Baron&quot; in 1138 and &quot;Baro&quot; in the 14th century. The origin of this place name is uncertain. Albert Dauzat suggests the cognomen &quot;Baro&quot; or a title of German origin &quot;Baron&quot;. René Lepelley meanwhile detects the Gallic &quot;barro&quot; meaning &quot;fence&quot; (in old French &quot;barre&quot;) or the Germanic anthroponym &quot;Baro&quot;.

==History==
Baron-sur-Odon appears as &quot;Baron&quot; on the 1750 Cassini Map and the same on the 1790 version.

The &quot;Chemin Haussé&quot;, which passes through the commune, is a Roman road identified as one of the roads included in the Tabula Peutingeriana. The road is mostly straight with embankments hence the name (Haussé means &quot;raised&quot;). This route was used as a line of communication until the end of the Middle Ages. It is also called the &quot;Path of Duke William&quot; on some land registers.

In June 1944, during Operation Epsom, the heights of &quot;Hill 112&quot; south-east of Baron-sur-Odon (also in the communes of Fontaine-Étoupefour, Vieux, and Esquay-Notre-Dame) was one objectives for the liberation of Caen. The fighting lasted more than a month.

===Heraldry===
The explanation of this blazon follows:

*The Croix de Guerre was awarded to the commune after the Battle of Hill 112 which took place on its soil.
*The arms of the Basse-Normandie region are represented by two golden leopards.

The horseshoe symbolizes the escape of William the Conqueror (from Valognes to Falaise in 1047) with his horse shod in reverse to mislead his pursuers. The ripples represent the river Odon.

==Administration==

List of Successive Mayors
The municipal council consists of 15 members including a Mayor and four deputies.

===Twinning===

Baron-sur-Odon has twinning associations with:
* Gaukönigshofen (Germany) since 1998.
* Chittlehampton (United Kingdom) since 1986.

==Demography==
In 2017 the commune had 939 inhabitants.

==Culture and heritage==

===Civil heritage===
*The Chateau of Tourmeauville (18th century) with its Chapel (19th century)
*A Chateau and Manor (16th century) is registered as an historical monument

===Religious heritage===
The Church of Notre-Dame of the Nativity (12th century) is registered as an historical monument.

<text>Barou-en-Auge (, literally &quot;Barou in Auge&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Conias&quot;.

==Geography==
Barou-en-Auge is located some 10 km north-east of Falaise and 8 km south of Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives. Access to the commune is by the D90 road from Louvagny in the north which passes through the centre of the commune and the village before continuing south to Le Marais-la-Chapelle. The D39 from Damblainville to Heurtevent forms the northern border of the commune. The D39B goes west from the village to Morteaux-Coulibœuf.

&quot;Le Beudron&quot; stream rises near the village and flows west to join the Dives west of the commune. The &quot;Ruisseau des Ruaux&quot; flows west through the south of the commune and also joins the Dives.

==Toponymy==
The spelling &quot;Barou&quot; was attested in 1417. René Lepelley suggested a possible attribution of its origin to the Gallic &quot;barro&quot; (&quot;barre&quot; in Old French) meaning &quot;fence&quot; joined to the Gallic suffix of presence &quot;-avo&quot; meaning &quot;enclosure&quot;. Albert Dauzat proposes the Latin anthroponym &quot;Barus&quot;.

The commune of &quot;Barou&quot; was renamed &quot;Barou-en-Auge&quot; in 1936.

==History==
Barou-en-Auge appears as &quot;Barou&quot; on the 1750 Cassini Map and the same on the 1790 version.

On 10 November 1855 at around 10:00 am a wolf was seen in Barou commune. Upon a declaration by the mayor a hunt was organized. All landowners with a gun had to travel to the edge of the wood where the wolf had entered. After an epic pursuit in the wood the wolf was wounded after several shots. He managed to escape and take refuge in a small wood located in the commune of Norrey. At eight in the evening the wolf was killed by a day labourer living in Barou. It was a wolf about 3 to 4 years old. A prize of 12 francs was granted.

The Falaise Pocket was the last operation of the Battle of Normandy during the Second World War. It took place from 12 to 21 August 1944 in an area between the four Normandy towns of Trun, Argentan, Vimoutiers and Chambois and ended near Falaise.

==Administration==

List of Successive Mayors
The Municipal Council is composed of 7 members including the Mayor and 1 deputy.

==Demography==
In 2017 the commune had 78 inhabitants.

==Culture and heritage==

===Civil heritage===

*An old Tile Factory. This factory is located on the first clays of the Auge area and close to the woods near Barou which provided fuel. In 1875 it employed four to fifteen workers. The origins of the factory are not known: it is certain that the factory already existed at the beginning of the 19th century when the &quot;Tile Factory of Barou&quot; was the property of the Jolivet de Colomby family and remains so today. The factory was rented to the Bernuis family. It permanently ceased its activities in 1916 during the First World War with the departure of the men to the front. Production at the factory was seasonal: in spring and summer the clay was mined and tiles were manufactured cooked in ten annual batches. Closed during the winter, the factory reopened after the last frost in April. In summer, especially during the harvest period, the workers went to harvest. Some remains have survived: parts of the oven, the clay insulating cover for baking, a granite millstone for crushing clay, the drying building, and the lodge for the operator who watched the process.
*The Chemin Haussé Roman road passes through the commune coming from Rouvres via Jort and continuing to Exmes.

The commune has a number of buildings and sites that are registered as historical monuments:

*The Grande Ferme Farmhouse (17th century)
*The Taverne Farmhouse (16th century) This farmhouse was once a taverne-inn. The rear façade and the two gables are built in masonry while the main façade is half-timbered with a Corbel arch supported at both corners by the gables. This mixed construction evokes both the Pays d&#x27;Auge in the timbering, and the Caen-Falaise plain in the limestone masonry, the village being located on the border of the two regions. The servants&#x27; quarters date from the 19th century.
*The Tarenne Farmhouse
*A Chateau(15th century)
*A House(18th century)
*Houses and Farms(16th-19th centuries)

===Religious heritage===

The Parish Church of Saint Martin (13th century) is registered as an historical monument. There is a statue in high relief representing the charity of Saint Martin above the portal of the bell tower. This 18th century statue is separated from the rest of the church following the disappearance of a large part of the nave in the late 19th century. It is topped by a weather vane decorated with a tricolor flag instead of the traditional rooster (replaced by the commune). The choir from the 13th century is illuminated by windows with Gothic lancets. The bays of the nave have survived and are closed by a facade decorated with a neo-Gothic portal. To the south, adjoining the choir, the lordly chapel is vaulted with intersecting ribs resting on columns. In the 16th century the lordship of Barou belonged to the Morell family of Aubigny. William, squire of the Queen and Governor of Mortagne au Perche, died in April 1615 as shown on a tombstone and &quot;Litre funéraire&quot; (a black band around the church to honour the deceased). A funeral decoration is painted in fresco on the wall. The conservation of this type of decoration is rare, the murals were frequently covered according to the tastes of the time.

The Church contains many items that are registered as historical objects:
*A Tombstone of William of Morel (1615)
*A Lectern (19th century)
*A Baptismal Font (16th century)
*A Tabernacle (17th century)
*An Altar and Retable (17th century)
*A Statue: Christ on the Cross (18th century)
*4 brasses (15th century)
*A Sacristy Chasuble Cabinet (19th century)
*A Litre funéraire (1615)
*4 Tombstones (19th century)
*A Group Sculpture: Charity of Saint Martin (16th century)

==Festivals==
*Festival Committee: &quot;Entertainment and leisure Barou-en-Auge&quot; (Albea).

<text>The Gyeongbuk Line () is a railway line serving North Gyeongsang Province in South Korea. The line runs from Gimcheon on the Gyeongbu Line via Sangju, Jeomchon (junction with the Mungyeong Line), and Yecheon to Yeongju on the Jungang Line.

== History ==
Construction of the line was begun by the privately owned Chosen Industrial Railway; however, before the line was finished, that company merged with five others to create the Chosen Railway (&quot;Chōtetsu&quot;) in 1923, and it was the new company which completed the first section of the line, opening the Gimcheon–Sangju section on 1 October 1924, followed by the Sangju–Jeomchon section on 25 December. Chōtetsu then extended the line in several stages, first reaching Yecheon on 1 November 1928, then reaching Gyeongbuk Andong on 16 October 1931; however, the latter section was dismantled in 1944 to use the material elsewhere as Japan&#x27;s military faced material shortages during the Pacific War. After the Liberation of Korea, the Chosen Railway was nationalised along with all other railways in the country.

Following the 1961 coup, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction started South Korea&#x27;s first five-year plan, which included a construction program to complete the railway network, to foster economic growth. Under the program, the Gyeongbuk Line was extended to Yeongju, to create a connection both with the Jungang Line and the Yeongdong Line, allowing the transport of coal from the latter. Work began in May 1962, the from Jeomchon to Yecheon was opened in January 1966, the from Yecheon to Yeongju was opened on 10 October 1966. The complete line is long, and remains single-tracked and unelectrified.

A long branch from Jeomchon to Mungyeong, the Mungyeong Line, was opened on 10 May 1969.

== Operation ==
As of 2010, the line is served by both passenger and freight trains along its entire length, as is the Mungyeong branch. As of November 2010, the line is served by Mugunghwa cross-country trains from Busan and Dongdaegu, which travel in 2 hours 12 minutes from Gimcheon to Yeongju.

<text>Bavent () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Baventais&quot; or &quot;Baventaises&quot;.

==Geography==
Bavent is located on the northern edge of the Caen plain some 8 km north-east of Caen and 6 km south-west of Cabourg. Access to the commune is by the D513 road from Varaville in the north-east which passes through the commune just north of the village and continues south-west to Hérouvillette. Access to the village is by the D236 which comes from Amfreville in the north-west. The D224 branches from the D513 in the commune and goes west to the village and continues to Goustranville. The D95A goes north from the village to Gonneville-en-Auge while the D95 goes south to Troarn. The D37B branches from the D513 in the west of the commune and goes north to Bréville-les-Monts. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of &quot;Chateau de Beneauville, Chef-de-Rue, Les Harnots, Grand Plain, La Ritachere, Le Prieure, La Petite Bruyere, Roncheville&quot;, and &quot;Robehomme&quot;. The commune is mostly farmland except for a large forest in the south.

At 1845 hectares, the commune is the largest in the canton of Cabourg. Its highest point (66 m) is located in the west near a place called &quot;La Grande Bruyère&quot;. Its lowest point (2 m) is at the exit of the Dives from the commune.

Due to its proximity to the sea, Bavent enjoys an oceanic climate. The nearest weather station is 19 km away at Caen-Carpiquet.

The river Dives forms the south-eastern border of the commune as it flows north-east to join the ocean at Houlgate. The &quot;Divette&quot; rises in the commune and flows north to join the Dives. The &quot;Douet du Moulin du Pre&quot; rises in the commune and flows north-east to join the Divette north of Varaville. The &quot;Saint-Laurent&quot; stream flows from the south through the commune and continues to join the Divette just north of the commune. The &quot;Ruisseau du Bois de Bavent&quot; forms part of the southern border of the commune.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Bavent&quot; is attested in the forms: &quot;Bavent&quot; in 1059, &quot;Badvento&quot; in 1063, and &quot;Batvent&quot; in 1066.

The origin of this place name divides Toponymists:

*Dauzat and Rostaing suggest &quot;bat vent&quot; meaning &quot;a place where the wind blows&quot;
*René Lepelley makes a similar hypothesis: that of an old mill whose &quot;sails are blown by the wind&quot;. There is fact a mill at Sénoville (Manche), called &quot;La Masse de Bavent&quot;.
*Ernest Nègre proposes an explanation of Bavent from a German anthroponym &quot;Badvin&quot;.

It is also possible to suggest the Celtic name &quot;-ent-&quot; Latinized to &quot;-entu&quot; (m) which is also found in Douvrend (&quot;Dovrent&quot; in the 12th century) preceded by an unknown element in the absence of an older form. The same suffix has been identified in Nogent (&quot;Novientum&quot;, from &quot;novio&quot; meaning &quot;new&quot;) and Drevant (&quot;Derventum&quot; from &quot;Dervo&quot; meaning &quot;oak&quot;, cf. Breton &quot;derv&quot; also meaning &quot;oak&quot;).

The name is homophonic with &quot;Bavans&quot; (&quot;Bavens&quot; 11th century, the name of a German man &quot;Bavo&quot; with the Germanic suffix &quot;-ingen&quot; Romanized to &quot;-ingos&quot;).

&quot;Robehomme&quot; is attested in the forms: &quot;Raimberti Hulmus&quot; in 1083, &quot;Rambertihulmus&quot; in 1149, and &quot;Robbehomme&quot; in 1190.

The first element &quot;Robe-&quot; comes from the German anthroponym &quot;Raimbert&quot;. The second element &quot;-homme&quot;n is widespread in Normandy in this form with the hiatus (the &quot;h&quot; is aspirated): &quot;Le Homme&quot; (not &quot;l&#x27;homme&quot; cf. Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme). This is a toponymic appellative derived from Old Norse &quot;holmr&quot; meaning &quot;island&quot; or &quot;meadow at the edge of the water&quot;. It also took the forms &quot;Houlme&quot; and &quot;Hom&quot;. Moreover, there is a hamlet of &quot;Hom&quot; at Robehomme.

There is also a personal name associated with a Norse appellative &quot;topt&quot; giving &quot;-tot&quot; as in &quot;Raimbertot&quot; at Cauville-sur-Mer (Seine-Maritime).

Bavent appears as &quot;Bavent&quot; on the 1750 Cassini Map and as &quot;Baven&quot; on the 1790 version.

Robehomme appears as &quot;Robehomme&quot; on the 1750 Cassini Map and as &quot;Robe homme&quot; on the 1790 version.

==History==

In 1974 the commune of Bavent (984 inhabitants in 1968) merged with Robehomme (122 inhabitants in 1954).

<text>Edgar Meyer (born November 24, 1960) is an American bassist and composer. His styles include classical, bluegrass, newgrass, and jazz. He has won seven Grammy Awards and been nominated ten times.

Meyer is a member of the Telluride Bluegrass Festival&#x27;s &quot;house band&quot; super group, along with Sam Bush, Béla Fleck, Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, and Bryan Sutton.

== Early life ==
Meyer grew up in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where he attended Oak Ridge High School. He learned to play the double bass from his father, Edgar Meyer Sr., who directed the string orchestra program for the local public school system. Meyer later went on to Indiana University to study with Stuart Sankey.

<text>The Gyeongchun Line is a regional rail line between Seoul and Chuncheon, South Korea, operated by Korail. Its name is derived from Gyeong (, meaning the capital, Seoul) and &quot;Chuncheon&quot;. It was completely reconstructed in the 2000s. Service on it has operated between Sangbong station on the Jungang Line in eastern Seoul and Chuncheon station, as part of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system, since December 21, 2010. A class of regional rail service named [[ITX-Cheongchun]] began operations on February 28, 2012, linking Chuncheon to Cheongnyangni and Yongsan Stations.

== History ==
The original Gyeongchun Line was opened along its full length of between Kwangwoon University on the Gyeongwon Line to Chuncheon by the privately owned Gyeongchun Railway on 20 July 1939. Chuncheon was the most popular destination for students on orientation trips, bringing passengers to the line. Following the Liberation of Korea, all railways, including the Gyeongchun Railway, were nationalised.

=== Upgrade ===

The line was upgraded into an electrified and double-tracked line for . Between Geumgok and Chuncheon, from 1997 until 2010, the line was re-laid in a straighter, 64.2 km long alignment with a budget of 2.151,931 billion won. The remaining 17.9 km of the upgraded line was built with a separate budget of 574.124 billion won. Towards Seoul, after Toegyewon station, this section of the new line diverges from the old alignment that ended in Seongbuk, and connects to the Jungang Line at Mangu station.

The new alignment was originally planned to be opened in 2004, but completion of the works was delayed for various reasons, including lack of funds. The complete new alignment opened and the old one closed on December 21, 2010.
On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Gyeongchun Line is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h and may see KTX service. For the longer term, the government also considers to build a parallel high-speed line that would continue beyond Chuncheon to Sokcho on South Korea&#x27;s east coast.

On November 4, 2016, two trains (one in the morning, one in the night) were added to the line. These trains run to and from Kwangwoon University station, allowing for transfers to Line 1. These trains take the Mangu Line Branch.

On September 26, 2016, the service was extended to Cheongnyangni station to improve access to regional trains (KTX, Seoul Metro Line 1) at the station. However, only 10 trains in each direction travel past Sangbong Station; the majority of the trains still terminate at Sangbong Station, and the two special rush-hour trains still run to and from Kwangwoon University Station.

== Services ==
=== Seoul Metropolitan Subway Gyeongchun Line ===

When the new Gyeongchun Line was opened on December 21, 2010, passenger service was integrated into the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system as a name of &quot;Seoul Metropolitan Subway Gyeongchun Line (수도권 전철 경춘선)&quot;. It brings that the system from Seoul all the way into Gangwon Province. The new service reduced travel time between Chuncheon and Sangbong in Seoul from two hours to 89 minutes, with different trains operating according to different stopping patterns; and increased capacity five-fold. Compared to the previous Mugunghwa-ho train service on the Gyeongchun Line, fares were reduced by half. For the service, Hyundai Rotem supplied Korail with fifteen eight-car Class 361000 EMU trains, out of which only fourteen trains remain in service on the line today.

Currently, Seoul Metropolitan Subway Gyeongchun Line serves mainly Sangbong station to Chuncheon station. Rare service to Cheongnyangni or Kwangwoon University station is also available, making it a Y-shaped line.

=== ITX-Cheongchun service===
On February 28, 2012, Korail introduced the ITX-Cheongchun service (Intercity Train EXpress), which uses Class 368000 trains with double-deck cars. From Chuncheon Station, the fastest ITX trains take 52 minutes to Cheongnyangni station, and 68 minutes to Yongsan station in Seoul, operating at a maximum speed of . The base fare is 9,800 won between Chuncheon and Yongsan, but Korail offers 15% discount at all time resulting price of 8,300 won. Basic discount rate was 30% until July 31, 2016, 25% until July 31, 2018, 15% since August 1, 2018.

=== Mugunghwa service ===
Some special Mugunghwa trains which deploy military troops takes the Gyeongchun Line.

== Service Route ==
=== Current Services ===

<text>Susannah Bright (born March 25, 1958) is an American feminist, author and journalist, often on the subject of politics and sexuality.

She is the recipient of the 2017 Humanist Feminist Award, and is one of the early writers/activists referred to as a sex-positive feminist. Her papers are part of the Human Sexuality Collection at Cornell University Library along with the archives of On Our Backs.

== Career ==
As a teenager in the 1970s, Susie Bright was active in the feminist, civil rights, and anti-war movements. She was a member of the high school underground newspaper &quot;The Red Tide&quot; and served as the plaintiff suing the Los Angeles Board of Education for the right of minors to distribute their own publications without prior censorship or approval. (Judgement in favor of Plaintiff).

She was a member of the International Socialists from 1974 to 1976 and worked as a labor and community organizer in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Detroit, and Louisville, Kentucky. She was also one of the founding members of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, and wrote under the pseudonym Sue Daniels in both &quot;The Red Tide&quot; and &quot;Workers&#x27; Power&quot;. She has said &quot;I was motivated, always, from the sting of social injustice. The cry of &#x27;That isn&#x27;t fair!&#x27; gets a more impulsive behavior from me than, &#x27;I want to get off!&#x27;&quot;

Bright was one of the early staff members of Good Vibrations, a pioneering feminist sex toy store, working at and managing the store from 1981 to 1986. She trained with San Francisco Sex Information in 1981. She wrote Good Vibrations&#x27; first mail order catalog, the first sex toy catalog written from a women&#x27;s point of a view for a female audience. She founded the Good Vibrations Erotic Video Library, the first feminist curation of erotic films available at the time.

Susie Bright co-founded and edited the first women-produced sex-magazine &quot;On Our Backs&quot;, &quot;entertainment for the adventurous lesbian,&quot; from 1984 to 1991. Here she began her sex advice column as &quot;Susie Sexpert.&quot; She collected these columns and expanded them to publish her first book, &quot;Susie Sexpert&#x27;s Lesbian Sex World&quot; in 1990.

Bright co-edited with Jill Posener and published a portfolio of lesbian erotic photography titled &quot;Nothing but the Girl&quot;, with 30 interviews with the photographers. It won the Firecracker Award and the Lambda Literary Award in 1997.

Bright founded the first women&#x27;s erotica book-series &quot;Herotica&quot; and edited the first three volumes. She started the national bestselling &quot;The Best American Erotica&quot; series in 1993.

From 1992 to 1994, she was the contributing editor and columnist for &quot;San Francisco Review of Books&quot;.

Bright was the first female member of the X-Rated Critics Organization in 1986 and was voted into the XRCO Hall of Fame, 5th Estate, in 2005.

Known as the &quot;Pauline Kael of Porn&quot;, she wrote feminist reviews of erotic films for &quot;Penthouse&quot; Forum from 1986 to 1989. She was the first mainstream journalist who covered the adult industry trade— and the first scholar to teach the aesthetics and politics of erotic film imagery, starting in 1986 at Cal Arts Valencia, and then in the early nineties at the University of California. Her film-reviews of mainstream movies are widely published, and her comments on gay film history are featured in the documentary film &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;. As well, she was featured in Maya Gallus&#x27;s 1997 documentary film &quot;&quot;.

Bright produced, co-wrote and starred in two plays, &quot;Girls Gone Bad&quot; and &quot;Knife, Paper, Scissors&quot;. She worked as a screenwriter and film consultant on several films: Erotique, Monika Treut&#x27;s &quot;Die Jungfrauenmaschine&quot; (aka &quot;Virgin Machine&quot;) film in 1988 as &quot;Susie Sexper,&quot; &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, The Criterion Collection&#x27;s edition of Luis Buñuel’s &quot;Belle de Jour&quot;, and the Wachowskis&#x27; film, &quot;Bound&quot; (in which she also had a cameo appearance). She also appeared as &quot;Susie Bright, the feminist sex writer&quot; in an episode of the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;.

In 2013, Bright donated her archives to the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections Cornell University Library. They included papers and documents from her early activist days in &quot;The Red Tide&quot;, Teamsters for a Democratic Union, and International Socialists, her early stage and film work, a complete archive of &quot;On Our Backs&quot; magazine and Fatale Videos, her reviews and research as a critic for &quot;Penthouse Forum&quot;, and the X-Rated Critics Association, all of her nonfiction manuscripts and anthology research for &quot;Best American Erotica&quot;, costumes, VHS tapes, books, writings— as well as many other artist files from the early lesbian feminist and erotic literary fiction publishing era.

The donation culminated with the 2014 year-long exhibit &quot;Speaking of Sex&quot; where Bright&#x27;s donations were displayed along with a wide array of the Human Sexuality Collection&#x27;s historical documents and materials. As part of the exhibit&#x27;s grand opening, Bright gave the lecture &quot;The Sexual State of the Union&quot;, analyzing current sexual attitudes in America, and reprised her show &quot;How to Read a Dirty Movie.&quot;

In 2022, Bright was in residence at the Cornell University Library for the exhibition Radical Desire: Making On Our Backs Magazine where she presented the panel discussion Making a Lesbian Sex Magazine in the Age of the Feminist Sex Wars with Lulu Belliveau, Phyllis Christopher, Del LaGrace, Morgan Gwenwald, Nan Kinney, Jill Posener, Jessica Tanzer, Deborah Sundahl, Karen Williams, and On Our Backs’ staffers, artists, and models.

Susie Bright was an editor-at-large and executive producer at Audible Inc. between 2012 and 2023. Her imprint is The Bright List. She has been nominated or awarded an Audie Award four times, including for her production of &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;. She has produced audiobook titles by Margaret Atwood, Pablo Neruda, Che Guevara, Frank O’Hara, Martin Luther King, Cornel West, Gary Snyder, Charles Bukowski, Noam Chomsky, Ron Kovic and Bruce Springsteen, Betty Medsger, Dorothy Allison, Dan Savage, Tony Hillerman, Joy Harjo, Octavia Butler, and Dave Hickey.

== Personal life ==
Bright is the daughter of linguist William Bright and Elizabeth Bright. Her stepmother is Lise Menn, and her stepbrothers are Joseph Menn and Stephen Menn.

Bright lived with her partner Honey Lee Cottrell in the 1980s. She is married to Jon Bailiff, with whom she has one daughter, Aretha Bright.

<doc id="502975" wikidata="Q715472" url="?curid=502975" title="Marc Denis">
<text>Joseph Marc Denis (born August 1, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender, who last played with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). For the 2009–10 season, he was hired as the goaltenders&#x27; coach of the Chicoutimi Saguenéens, a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) team. He is currently working as a colour analyst for the Francophone Canadian sports station, RDS. He is the all time leader in save percentage in the shootout among goaltenders who have faced at least 40 shootout attempts.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Denis played in the 1990 and 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Montreal.

Denis was drafted 25th overall by the Colorado Avalanche at the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. Upon turning professional with Colorado, Denis mainly played for Colorado&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hershey Bears, and played a total of 28 regular season games in three seasons for the Avalanche. On June 7, 2000, Denis was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for a second-round pick in the 2000 draft (used to choose Tomas Kurka). During the 2002–03 NHL season, he set the then-NHL record for most minutes in a season with 4,511, playing 77 regular season games that season.

On June 30, 2006, Denis was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Fredrik Modin and Fredrik Norrena. In the 2007–08 season, on December 28, due to his sub-par and inconsistent play, the Lightning waived Denis. After he cleared waivers, Denis was sent down to the Lightning&#x27;s AHL affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. The Lightning later recalled Denis from Norfolk on March 26, 2008. Denis replaced goalie Jonathan Boutin, who was earlier recalled from the Admirals on an emergency basis because starting goalie Mike Smith had a sprained left ankle. After the season, Denis was bought out from the Lightning on June 25, 2008.

Denis, who therefore became a free agent, then signed a contract with his hometown team, the Montreal Canadiens, on July 3, 2008. After training camp, Marc Denis was assigned to Montreal&#x27;s AHL affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs. Denis was recalled as an injury replacement for the Canadiens throughout the season and appeared in one game with the Canadiens when he relieved Jaroslav Halak for the third period in a 4–1 loss to the New Jersey Devils on January 2, 2009.

<doc id="502983" wikidata="Q750567" url="?curid=502983" title="German spring offensive">
<text>The German spring offensive, also known as Kaiserschlacht (&quot;Kaiser&#x27;s Battle&quot;) or the Ludendorff offensive, was a series of German attacks along the Western Front during the First World War, beginning on 21 March 1918. Following American entry into the war in April 1917, the Germans decided that their only remaining chance of victory was to defeat the Allies before the United States could ship soldiers across the Atlantic and fully deploy its resources. The German Army had gained a temporary advantage in numbers as nearly 50 divisions had been freed by the Russian defeat and withdrawal from the war with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

There were four German offensives, codenamed &quot;Michael&quot;, &quot;Georgette&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, and &quot;Blücher-Yorck&quot;. &quot;Michael&quot; was the main attack, which was intended to break through the Allied lines, outflank the British forces (which held the front from the Somme River to the English Channel) and defeat the British Army. Once that was achieved, it was hoped that the French would seek armistice terms. The other offensives were subsidiary to &quot;Michael&quot; and were designed to divert Allied forces from the main offensive effort on the Somme. No clear objective was established before the start of the offensives and once the operations were underway, the targets of the attacks were constantly changed, depending on the tactical situation.

Once they began advancing, the Germans struggled to maintain the momentum, partly due to logistical issues. The fast-moving stormtrooper units could not carry enough food and ammunition to sustain themselves for long, and the army could not move in supplies and reinforcements fast enough to assist them. The Allies concentrated their main forces in the essential areas (the approaches to the Channel Ports and the rail junction of Amiens). Strategically worthless ground, which had been devastated by years of conflict, was left lightly defended. Within a few weeks, the danger of a German breakthrough had passed, though related fighting continued until July.

The German Army made the deepest advances either side had made on the Western Front since 1914. They re-took much ground that they had lost in 1916–17 and took some ground that they had not yet controlled. Despite these apparent successes, they suffered heavy casualties in return for land that was of little strategic value and hard to defend. The offensive failed to deliver a blow that could save Germany from defeat, which has led some historians to describe it as a Pyrrhic victory. In July 1918, the Allies regained their numerical advantage with the arrival of American troops. In August, they used this and improved tactics to launch a counteroffensive. The ensuing Hundred Days Offensive resulted in the Germans losing all of the ground that they had taken in the Spring Offensive, the collapse of the Hindenburg Line, and the capitulation of Germany that November.

==German preparations==

===Strategy===
The German High Command—in particular General Erich Ludendorff, the Chief Quartermaster General at Oberste Heeresleitung, the supreme army headquarters—has been criticised by military historians for the failure to formulate sound and clear strategy. Ludendorff privately conceded that Germany could no longer win a war of attrition, yet he was not ready to give up the German gains in the west and east and was one of the main obstacles to the German government&#x27;s attempts to reach a settlement with the Western Allies.

Although Ludendorff was unsure whether the Americans would enter the war in strength, at a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff of the German armies on the Western Front on 11 November 1917, he decided to launch an offensive. The German government and Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, nominally the Chief of the General Staff, were not party to the planning process. Eventually it was decided to launch Operation Michael near Saint-Quentin, at the hinge between the French and British armies, and strike north to Arras. The main reason for the choice was tactical expediency. The ground on this sector of the front would dry out much sooner after the winter and spring rains and would therefore be easier to advance across. It was also a line of least resistance as the British and French armies were weak in the sector.

The intention was not to reach the English Channel coast, but to break through the Allied lines and roll up the flank of the British army from the south, pushing it back toward the Channel ports or destroying it if the British chose to stand and fight. Further operations such as Operation Georgette and Operation Mars were designed to strike further north to seize the remaining Allied ports in Belgium and France while diverting Allied forces from &quot;Michael&quot;. However, these remained only secondary and weaker operations, subordinate to &quot;Michael&quot;.

The constant changing of operational targets once the offensive was underway gave the impression the German command had no coherent strategic goal. Any capture of an important strategic objective, such as the Channel ports, or the vital railway junction of Amiens, would have occurred more by chance than by design.

===Changes in tactics===
The German army had concentrated many of its best troops into stormtrooper units, trained in infiltration tactics to infiltrate and bypass enemy front line units, leaving these strong points to be &quot;mopped-up&quot; by follow-up troops. The stormtrooper tactic was to attack and disrupt enemy headquarters, artillery units and supply depots in the rear areas, as well as to occupy territory rapidly. Each major formation &quot;creamed off&quot; its best and fittest soldiers into storm units; several complete divisions were formed from these elite units. This process gave the German army an initial advantage in the attack, but meant that the best formations would suffer disproportionately heavy casualties, while the quality of the remaining formations declined as they were stripped of their best personnel to provide the stormtroops. The Germans also failed to arm their forces with a mobile exploitation force, such as cavalry, to exploit gains quickly. This tactical error meant the infantry had to keep up an exhausting tempo of advance. Notwithstanding the effectiveness of the stormtroopers, the following German infantry often made attacks in large traditional waves and suffered heavy casualties.

To enable the initial breakthrough, Lieutenant Colonel Georg Bruchmüller, a German artillery officer, developed the &#x27;, (literally: rolling fire, rolling barrage) an effective and economical creeping barrage scheme. There were three phases: first, a brief bombardment on the enemy&#x27;s command and communications (headquarters, telephone exchanges, etc.); then, destruction of their artillery; lastly an attack upon the enemy front-line infantry defences. Bombardment would always be brief so as to retain surprise. Bruchmüller&#x27;s tactics were made possible by the vast numbers of heavy guns—with correspondingly plentiful amounts of ammunition for them—which Germany possessed by 1918.

==Allied preparations==

===Defensive tactics===
In their turn, the Allies had developed defences in depth, reducing the proportion of troops in their front line and pulling reserves and supply dumps back beyond German artillery range. This change had been made after experience of the successful German use of defence in depth during 1917.

In theory, the front line was an &quot;outpost zone&quot; (later renamed the &quot;forward zone&quot;), lightly held by snipers, patrols and machine-gun posts only. Behind, out of range of German field artillery, was the &quot;battle zone&quot; where the offensive was to be firmly resisted, and behind that again, out of range of all but the heaviest German guns, was a &quot;rear zone&quot; where reserves were held ready to counter-attack or seal off penetrations. In theory, a British infantry division (with nine infantry battalions) deployed three battalions in the outpost zone, four battalions in the battle zone and two battalions in the rear zone.

This change had not been completely implemented by the Allies. In particular, in the sector held by the British Fifth Army, which they had recently taken over from French units, the defences were incomplete and there were too few troops to hold the complete position in depth. The rear zone existed as outline markings only, and the battle zone consisted of battalion &quot;redoubts&quot; which were not mutually supporting (allowing stormtroopers to penetrate between them).

==Operation Michael==

On 21 March 1918, the Germans launched a large offensive against the British Fifth Army and the right wing of the British Third Army.


The German armies involved were—from north to south—the Seventeenth Army under Otto von Below, the Second Army under Georg von der Marwitz and the Eighteenth Army under Oskar von Hutier, with a Corps (Gruppe Gayl) from the Seventh Army supporting Hutier&#x27;s attack. Although the British had learned the approximate time and location of the offensive, the weight of the attack and of the preliminary bombardment was an unpleasant surprise. The Germans were also fortunate in that the morning of the attack was foggy, allowing the stormtroopers leading the attack to penetrate deep into the British positions undetected.

By the end of the first day, the British had lost 7,512 dead and 10,000 wounded and the Germans had broken through at several points on the front of the British Fifth Army. After two days the Fifth Army was in full retreat. As they fell back, many of the isolated &quot;redoubts&quot; were left to be surrounded and overwhelmed by the following German infantry. The right wing of Third Army became separated from the retreating Fifth Army, and also retreated to avoid being outflanked.

Ludendorff failed to follow the correct stormtrooper tactics, as described above. His lack of a coherent strategy to accompany the new tactics was expressed in a remark to Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria—commander of one of his Army Groups—in which he stated, &quot;We chop a hole. The rest follows.&quot; Ludendorff&#x27;s dilemma was that the most important parts of the Allied line were also the most strongly held. Much of the German advance was achieved where it was not strategically significant. Because of this, Ludendorff continually exhausted his forces by attacking strongly entrenched British units. At Arras on 28 March, he launched a hastily prepared attack (Operation Mars) against the left wing of the British Third Army, to try to widen the breach in the Allied lines. In this sector, the British defences in depth were complete and fully manned, some of the opening German bombardment hit only empty positions and there was no fog to give cover to the attacking stormtroopers. After a day, the Germans had achieved only minor gains and had suffered heavy casualties. Operation Mars was immediately cancelled.

The German breakthrough had occurred just to the north of the boundary between the French and British armies. The French commander-in-chief, General Philippe Pétain, sent reinforcements to the sector too slowly in the opinion of the British commander-in-chief, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, and the British government, though the historian Elizabeth Greenhalgh disputes this, arguing that Petain sent the six additional divisions quicker than had been arranged with Haig – in 2 days instead of 4 – and arranging for extra divisions several times – 12 divisions on 23 March and 13 on the 25/26 March – before requests came in from Haig. The Allies reacted by appointing the French General Ferdinand Foch to coordinate all Allied activity in France, and subsequently as commander-in-chief of all Allied forces everywhere.

The success of Operation Michael led German infantry to advance too far from its supply bases and railheads. The stormtrooper units leading the advance carried supplies for only a few days, to avoid being overburdened, and relied on supplies delivered quickly from the rear. The advance was slowed by supply shortages, which gave Allied commanders more time to reinforce the threatened areas and to slow the advance still more. German supply difficulties were made worse by the direction of advance, which crossed the wasteland created during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and by Operation Alberich, the German retirement to the Hindenburg Line from February to March 1917.
After a few days, the German advance began to falter, as the infantry became exhausted and it became increasingly difficult to move artillery and supplies forward to support them. Fresh British and Australian units were moved to the vital rail centre of Amiens and the defence began to stiffen. After fruitless attempts to capture Amiens, Ludendorff called off Operation Michael on 5 April. By the standards of the time, there had been a substantial advance. It was, however, of little value; a Pyrrhic victory in terms of the casualties suffered by the crack troops, as the vital positions of Amiens and Arras remained in Allied hands. The newly-won territory would later be difficult to defend against Allied counter-attacks.

The Allies lost nearly 255,000 men (British, British Empire and French). They also lost 1,300 artillery pieces and 200 tanks. All of this could be replaced, either from French and British factories or from American manpower. German troop losses were 239,000 men, many of them specialist shocktroops (&quot;Stoßtruppen&quot;) who were irreplaceable. In terms of morale, the initial German jubilation at the successful opening of the offensive soon turned to disappointment, as it became clear that the attack had not achieved decisive results.

==&quot;Georgette&quot;==


&quot;Michael&quot; had drawn British forces to defend Amiens, leaving the rail route through Hazebrouck and the approaches to the Channel ports of Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk vulnerable. German success here could choke the British into defeat.

The attack started on 9 April after a creeping barrage. The main attack was made on the open and flat sector defended by the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps. After an entire year spent in the trenches, the Portuguese were tired and had suffered heavy losses. They were being replaced in the front line by fresh British divisions, an operation that was planned to be completed on 9 April, the same day as the Germans attacked the sector. The process of relief in place was poorly organized by the British First Army&#x27;s command, and the Portuguese 1st Division had been withdrawn to the rear on 6 April, leaving the Portuguese 2nd Division to defend the entire sector alone. They were left with an extensive front, without natural obstacles which might benefit the defence.

Hit hard by the bombardment and under the assault of eight German divisions, the Portuguese 2nd Division made a desperate defence, trying to hold their positions, which, however, were rapidly enveloped and overrun by the masses of German forces. The 2nd Division was virtually annihilated, losing more than 7,000 men. The British 40th Division, on the northern flank of the Portuguese, also rapidly collapsed before the attack, opening a gap that further facilitated the envelopment of the Portuguese by the Germans. However, under much less pressure from the Germans and occupying good defensive positions protected by the La Bassée Canal, the British 55th Division on the southern flank of the Portuguese were able to hold much of their position throughout the battle.

The next day, the Germans widened their attack to the north, forcing the defenders of Armentières to withdraw before they were surrounded, and capturing most of Messines Ridge. By the end of the day, the few British divisions in reserve were hard-pressed to hold a line along the River Lys.

Without French reinforcements, it was feared that the Germans could advance the remaining to the ports within a week. The commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, issued an &quot;Order of the Day&quot; on 11 April stating, &quot;With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause, each one of us must fight on to the end.&quot;

However, the German offensive had stalled because of logistical problems and exposed flanks. Counterattacks by British, French and Anzac forces slowed and stopped the German advance. Ludendorff ended &quot;Georgette&quot; on 29 April.

As with &quot;Michael&quot;, losses were roughly equal, approximately 110,000 men wounded or killed, each. Again, the strategic results were disappointing for the Germans. Hazebrouck remained in Allied hands and the Germans occupied a vulnerable salient under fire from three sides. The British abandoned the comparatively worthless territory they had captured at vast cost the previous year around Ypres, freeing several divisions to face the German attackers.

==&quot;Blücher–Yorck&quot;==

While &quot;Georgette&quot; ground to a halt, a new attack on French positions was planned to draw forces further away from the Channel and allow renewed German progress in the north. The strategic objective remained to split the British and the French and gain victory before American forces could make their presence felt on the battlefield. The Americans were originally deployed in the quiet Saint-Mihiel sector in Lorraine where they had their first significant engagement in the defence of Seicheprey on 20 April. After the British had held off the &quot;Michael&quot; advance on the Somme, the US 1st Division was moved to reinforce the line in that sector in mid-April and launched their first attack of the war on Cantigny on 28 May 1918.

The German attack took place on 27 May, between Soissons and Reims. The sector was partly held by four depleted British divisions which were &quot;resting&quot; after their exertions earlier in the year. In this sector, the defences had not been developed in depth, mainly due to the obstinacy of the commander of the French Sixth Army, General Denis Auguste Duchêne. As a result, the German creeping barrage was very effective and the Allied front, with a few notable exceptions, collapsed. Duchêne&#x27;s massing of his troops in the forward trenches also meant there were no local reserves to delay the Germans once the front had broken. Despite French and British resistance on the flanks, German troops advanced to the Marne River and Paris seemed a realistic objective. There was a frenzied atmosphere in Paris, which German long-range guns had been shelling since 21 March, with many citizens fleeing and the government drawing up plans to evacuate to Bordeaux.

Yet again, losses were much the same on each side: and casualties up to 6 June. German losses were again mainly from the difficult-to-replace assault divisions.

==&quot;Gneisenau&quot;==
Although Ludendorff had intended to be a prelude to a decisive offensive () to defeat the British forces further north, he made the error of reinforcing merely tactical success by moving reserves from Flanders to the Aisne, whereas Foch and Haig did not overcommit reserves to the Aisne. Ludendorff sought to extend westward with Operation Gneisenau, intending to draw yet more Allied reserves south, widen the German salient and link with the German salient at Amiens.

The French had been warned of this attack (the Battle of Matz ()) by information from German prisoners, and their defence in depth reduced the impact of the artillery bombardment on 9 June. Nonetheless, the German advance (consisting of 21 divisions attacking over a front) along the Matz River was impressive, resulting in an advance of despite fierce French and American resistance. At Compiègne, a sudden French counter-attack on 11 June, by four divisions and 150 tanks (under General Charles Mangin) with no preliminary bombardment, caught the Germans by surprise and halted their advance. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was called off the following day.

Losses were approximately 35,000 Allied and 30,000 German.

==Last German attack (&quot;Marneschutz-Reims/Friedensturm&quot;)==

Ludendorff now postponed and launched the German Seventh, First and Third Armies in the (Peace Offensive) of 15 July, a renewed attempt to draw Allied reserves south from Flanders and to expand the salient created by eastwards. An attack east of Rheims was thwarted by the French defence in depth. In many sectors, the Germans, deprived of any surprise as their fuel-starved air force had lost air superiority to the Allies, advanced no further than the French Forward Zone, and nowhere did they break the French Battle (Second) Zone.

Although German troops southwest of Rheims succeeded in crossing the River Marne, the French launched a major offensive of their own on the west side of the salient on 18 July, threatening to cut off the Germans in the salient. Ludendorff had to evacuate most of the salient by 7 August and was finally cancelled. The initiative had clearly passed to the Allies, who were shortly to begin the Hundred Days Offensive which ended the war.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
The &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; offensives had yielded large territorial gains for the Germans, in First World War terms. However, victory was not achieved and the German armies were severely depleted, exhausted and in exposed positions. The territorial gains were in the form of salients which greatly increased the length of the line that would have to be defended when Allied reinforcements gave the Allies the initiative. In six months, the strength of the German army had fallen from 5.1 million fighting men to 4.2 million. By July, the German superiority of numbers on the Western Front had sunk to 207 divisions to 203 Allied, a negligible lead which would be reversed as more American troops arrived. German manpower was exhausted. The German High Command predicted they would need 200,000 men per month to make good the losses suffered. Returning convalescents could supply 70,000–80,000 per month but there were only 300,000 recruits available from the next annual class of eighteen-year-olds. Even worse, they lost most of their best-trained men: stormtrooper tactics had them leading the attacks. Even so, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until the end of the war.

The Allies had been badly hurt but not broken. The lack of a unified high command was partly rectified by the appointment of General Foch to the supreme command, and coordination would improve in later Allied operations. American troops were for the first time also used as independent formations.

Ironically, the offensive&#x27;s initial success may have hastened Germany&#x27;s defeat by undermining morale. German leadership had hitherto told their soldiers that food and other supply shortages were comparable on both sides. By breaking into Allied lines, the German soldiers realized that the Allies were in fact much better fed and supplied than they were, and thus that their leaders had been lying to them.

<text>Beaufour-Druval () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Beaufourquais-Druvalais&quot; or &quot;Beaufourquaises-Druvalaises&quot;.

==Geography==
Beaufour-Druval is located some 25 km east by north-east of Caen and 12 km south-east of Cabourg. Access to the commune is by the D287 road from Angerville in the north-west, the D276 from Cresseveuille in the north which continues south-east to Auvillars, and the D146 from Beuvron-en-Auge in the south-west which continues to join the D45 in the north-east. The D85 from Saint-Léger-Dubosq in the west to Rumesnil in the south forms part of the south-western border of the commune. Apart from the village, there are the hamlets of Saint-Aubin-Lebizay and La Ruelle. The commune is entirely farmland.

The &quot;Ruisseau de Druval&quot; forms the south-eastern border of the commune as it flows south-west to join the &quot;Doigt&quot; west of Rumesnil. Several unnamed tributaries rise in the commune and flow south-east to join the Ruisseau de Druval.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Beaufour&quot; was attested in its Romanesque form &quot;Belfou&quot; in 1040 and 1066 then badly Latinized to &quot;Bellafagus&quot; in 1195.

The name has no relationship with &quot;un four&quot; as shown in the old forms but comes from the beech tree, which was formerly called &quot;fou&quot; in the west.

&quot;Druval&quot; comes from &quot;Drudo&quot; plus the Latin suffix &quot;vallem&quot;.

Beaufour appears as &quot;Beaufou&quot; on the 1750 Cassini Map and the same on the 1790 version.

Druval appears as &quot;Druval&quot; on the 1750 Cassini Map and the same on the 1790 version.

==History==
The commune was created in 1972 from the merger of &quot;Beaufour&quot;, &quot;Druval&quot;, and &quot;Saint-Aubin-Lebizay&quot;.

The commune is probably the birthplace of William de Beaufeu, Bishop of Thetford from 1086 to 1091. It is also the probable birthplace of Richard de Beaufou, bishop of Avranches from 1134 to 1142 who is probably related to William de Beaufou.

<doc id="502989" wikidata="Q23035575" url="?curid=502989" title="College Democrats">
<text>College Democrats is an organization located on several college campuses. Their main focus is to elect Democratic Party candidates and provide networking and leadership opportunities for student members. The chapters have served as a way for college students to connect with the Democratic Party and Democratic campaigns, and has produced many prominent liberal and progressive activists.

Many of these chapters are organized under the College Democrats of America, the official youth outreach arm of the Democratic National Committee, which claims over 100,000 college and university student members from across the United States. Other chapters are organized under the Young Democrats of America and its College Caucus.

==Activities==
Immediately leading up to election day, chapters are expected to participate in get out the vote (GOTV) activities, both on-campus and in surrounding communities.

Other activities are not centrally determined, and thus vary from chapter to chapter. Typical activities might include inviting guest speakers (often elected officials or party activists) to campus, organizing issue advocacy and lobbying efforts (like letter-writing campaigns or phone banks), and arranging service activities for members to attend.

College Democrats chapters also often organize social events (like sporting competitions with College Republicans chapters) and other recruitment activities.

During the election season, campus chapters typically partake in campaign work. These efforts generally include voter registration drives and dorm storms to register youth voters that have just gained voter eligibility. They also include providing youth manpower to campaigns for canvassing and phone banks. During presidential election years, chapters have organized proxy debates and run mock elections.

=== Presidential Primaries ===
Many chapters of the College Democrats took part in the 2016 Democratic Primary between Secretary Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT). In the run-up to the campaign&#x27;s launch, many students participated in Ready for Hillary PAC&#x27;s efforts to build support for Clinton. The statewide organization in California actively supported the PAC and recruited supporters while many chapters hosted the PAC&#x27;s Hillary Bus on their campuses to build support for Clinton.

<text>The Gyeongwon Line is a railway line serving northeastern Gyeonggi Province in South Korea. The line is operated by Korail. The name of the line came from Gyeongseong&quot; ([[Seoul]]) and [[Wonsan|Won]]san&quot;, the original terminus of the line, in what is now North Korea.

==History==
&quot;For the original line&#x27;s history and other information prior to 1945, see Gyeongwon Line (1911–1945)&quot;

One of the first construction projects undertaken by the Railway Bureau of the Government General of Korea was for an east−west trunk line to connect Keijō to the important port of Wonsan. The Chosen Government Railway (&quot;Sentetsu&quot;) opened the line in several stages between 1911 and 1914. The first section of mainline to be electrified by Sentetsu was also along the Gyeongwon Line, with the Pokkye−Gosan section being energised on 27 March 1944, as part of a plan made jointly with the South Manchuria Railway for an electrified railway all the way from Busan to Xinjing, capital of Manchukuo.

After the partition of Korea following the end of the Pacific War in 1945, the Gyeongwon Line was split along the 38th parallel between the stations of Hantangang and Choseongni. The railways in both South and North were nationalised, and the newly-established Korean National Railroad took over operation of the truncated Gyeongwon Line, from Seoul to Choseongni; in the North, the Korean State Railway merged its section of the Gyeongwon Line, Choseong-ri−Wonsan, with the Wonsan−Gowon section of the former Hamgyeong Line to create the Gangwon Line.

The line was severely damaged during the Korean War. After the ceasefire and the subsequent establishment of the Military Demarcation Line, the division of the line changed, with the South gaining control of the line further northwards as far as Woljeongni. However, the line was rebuilt only as far as Sintalli, resulting in an operation line from Yongsan and Sintalli with a length of .

Following the 1961 coup, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction started South Korea&#x27;s first five-year plan, which included a construction program to complete the railway network, to foster economic growth. As part of the program, in the outskirts of Seoul, a long avoiding line was built from Kwangwoon University to Mangu on the Jungang Line, called the Mangu Line, which opened on December 30, 1963.

===Upgrade===

The section of the Gyeongwon Line in the Seoul metropolitan area was among the first to be electrified with the 25 kV/60 Hz AC catenary system in South Korea when to allow for through train services with Seoul Subway Line 1. Further sections were electrified and urban services to Line 1 was extended in the 1980s and then in the 2000s:

Altogether of the line was electrified, and was double-tracked.

On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Gyeongwon Line is to be further upgraded until Uijeongbu for 230 km/h and may see KTX service.
In 2012 restoration of the line was completed between Sintan-ri and Baengmagoji.

On December 16, 2023, a single-line railway between Soyosan and Yeoncheon opened on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway Line 1.

<doc id="503007" wikidata="Q938895" url="?curid=503007" title="Polaris (American band)">
<text>Polaris is an American independent rock band that was formed as a one-off musical project in the early 1990s, involving members of the New Haven indie rock band Miracle Legion. They were commissioned specifically to produce music for the Nickelodeon television show &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, which was later compiled into the group&#x27;s first and only album. Nearly twenty years after the show was cancelled, Polaris reemerged with its first tour and a cassingle of two new songs.

==History==

Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi, the show-runners of &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, were fans of Miracle Legion and approached the band to write original music for the series. Miracle Legion was at the time suffering from long-running legal issues with their label, Morgan Creek Records, and lead guitarist Ray Neal, disillusioned by the experience and recently married, opted out of the television project.

The remainder of the band - frontman Mark Mulcahy, bassist Dave McCaffrey and drummer Scott Boutier - moved forward with the project under the name Polaris. As the show&#x27;s &quot;house band&quot;, Polaris produced twelve songs over &quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot;&#x27;s three seasons including the theme song, &quot;Hey Sandy.&quot; These tracks included occasional guest contributors such as Joyce Raskin, Dennis Kelly, and Buell Thomas.

Describing itself as &quot;that band that lives in your TV,&quot; the members of Polaris took on &quot;TV names&quot;: Mulcahy was &quot;Muggy&quot;, Boutier was &quot;Jersey&quot;, and McCaffrey was &quot;Harris Polaris.&quot; In addition to appearing in the opening credits of each show, the band featured prominently in the episode &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Pete&quot;, in which Little Pete (Danny Tamberelli) is mesmerized by a garage band&#x27;s song (Polaris&#x27; &quot;Summerbaby&quot;) and forms his own band to keep the tune in his memory.

The group&#x27;s first release was a 1995 cassette mini-album titled &quot;Happily Deranged&quot; that contained three songs from the television show, including the television show&#x27;s title song, &quot;Hey Sandy&quot;. The other two songs were &quot;Staggering&quot; and &quot;Coronado II&quot;. The versions of these songs differed in both running time and mix from the versions later released on their full album. The cassette also contained two additional rare tracks, an introduction and closing comments by the older of the two Petes from the television show. This cassette was released by Nickelodeon/ Sony Wonder and only available by mail as a promotional tie-in with Frosted Mini Wheats cereal. The offer was heavily promoted during Nickelodeon&#x27;s SNICK (Saturday Night Nickelodeon) anthology series.

After the show was cancelled in 1996, Miracle Legion produced a final album released by Mulcahy&#x27;s own label, Mezzotint Records. In 1999, the label released &quot;Music from The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, containing all twelve of the Polaris tracks and serving as the group&#x27;s only album.

Following the disbandment of both bands, Mulcahy focused on a solo career. From 1997 to 2003, Scott Boutier and Dave McCaffrey played drums &amp; bass for Frank Black.

On August 28, 2012, Polaris reunited for a concert at Cinefamily&#x27;s Everything Is Festival II as part of a &quot;Pete &amp; Pete&quot; reunion event, adding Henning Ohlenbusch (dubbed &quot;Penny Polaris&quot;) to their roster on guitar, keyboard, and backing vocals. The band claimed it was their first live performance ever. For one song at this concert, the group was joined by Rain Phoenix on vocals.

On August 26, 2014, Polaris announced their first tour, &quot;Waiting for October&quot;, with nine shows in cities such as New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

In October 2014, the band released their first new material since the Nickelodeon show in the form of a digital and cassette single, thus ending their status as a &quot;one-off project&quot;. The cassingle, consisting of &quot;Great Big Happy Green Moonface&quot; (also its title) and &quot;Baby Tae Kwon Do&quot; was made available through the Mezzotint website. It was produced by new member Ohlenbusch. In addition, an animated music video was produced for &quot;Great Big Happy Green Moonface&quot;.

Polaris continued touring into 2015, their sets including all fourteen Polaris songs and selections from the Miracle Legion discography. On April 18, 2015, Polaris released both a vinyl edition of &quot;Music from The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; and the double-CD album, &quot;Live at Lincoln Hall&quot;, a recording of their concert of October 26, 2014 at the Chicago venue. In 2016, the Miracle Legion discography received a digital re-release and the band planned a brief reunion tour of their own.

In 2020, Mezzotint released a &quot;Music from the Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete 21st Century Edition&quot; on vinyl with a bonus CD of demos for many of the songs.

<text>PubMed is a openly-accessible free database which includes primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health maintains the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval.

From 1971 to 1997, online access to the MEDLINE database was provided via computer and phone lines primarily through institutional facilities, such as university libraries. PubMed, first released in January 1996, ushered in the era of private, free, home- and office-based MEDLINE searching. The PubMed system was offered free to the public starting in June 1997.
==Content==
In addition to MEDLINE, PubMed provides access to:
* older references from the print version of &quot;Index Medicus&quot;, back to 1951 and earlier
* references to some journals before they were indexed in Index Medicus and MEDLINE, for instance &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;BMJ&quot;, and &quot;Annals of Surgery&quot;
* very recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and added to MEDLINE
* a collection of books available full-text and other subsets of NLM records
* PMC citations
* NCBI Bookshelf

Many PubMed records contain links to full text articles, some of which are freely available, often in PubMed Central and local mirrors, such as Europe PubMed Central.

Information about the journals indexed in MEDLINE, and available through PubMed, is found in the NLM Catalog.

, PubMed has more than 35 million citations and abstracts dating back to 1966, selectively to the year 1865, and very selectively to 1809. , 24.6 million of PubMed&#x27;s records are listed with their abstracts, and 26.8 million records have links to full-text versions (of which 10.9 million articles are available, full-text for free). Over the last 10 years (ending 31 December 2019), an average of nearly one million new records were added each year. 

In 2016, NLM changed the indexing system so that publishers are able to directly correct typos and errors in PubMed indexed articles.

PubMed has been reported to include some articles published in predatory journals. MEDLINE and PubMed policies for the selection of journals for database inclusion are slightly different. Weaknesses in the criteria and procedures for indexing journals in PubMed Central may allow publications from predatory journals to leak into PubMed.

==Characteristics==

===Website design===
A new PubMed interface was launched in October 2009 and encouraged the use of such quick, Google-like search formulations; they have also been described as &#x27;telegram&#x27; searches. By default the results are sorted by Most Recent, but this can be changed to Best Match, Publication Date, First Author, Last Author, Journal, or Title.

The PubMed website design and domain was updated in January 2020 and became default on 15 May 2020, with the updated and new features. There was a critical reaction from many researchers who frequently use the site.

PubMed/MEDLINE can be accessed via handheld devices, using for instance the &quot;PICO&quot; option (for focused clinical questions) created by the NLM. A &quot;PubMed Mobile&quot; option, providing access to a mobile friendly, simplified PubMed version, is also available.

===Search===
====Standard search====
Simple searches on PubMed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into PubMed&#x27;s search window.

PubMed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names, relevant MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms, synonyms, Boolean operators, and &#x27;nests&#x27; the resulting terms appropriately, enhancing the search formulation significantly, in particular by routinely combining (using the OR operator) textwords and MeSH terms.

====Comprehensive search====
For optimal searches in PubMed, it is necessary to understand its core component, MEDLINE, and especially of the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) controlled vocabulary used to index MEDLINE articles. They may also require complex search strategies, use of field names (tags), proper use of limits and other features; reference librarians and search specialists offer search services.

The search into PubMed&#x27;s search window is only recommended for the search of unequivocal topics or new interventions that do not yet have a MeSH heading created, as well as for the search for commercial brands of medicines and proper nouns. It is also useful when there is no suitable heading or the descriptor represents a partial aspect. The search using the thesaurus MeSH is more accurate and will give fewer irrelevant results. In addition, it saves the disadvantage of the free text search in which the spelling, singular/plural or abbreviated differences have to be taken into consideration. On the other side, articles more recently incorporated into the database to which descriptors have not yet been assigned will not be found. Therefore, to guarantee an exhaustive search, a combination of controlled language headings and free text terms must be used.

===Journal article parameters===
When a journal article is indexed, numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information. Such parameters are: Article Type (MeSH terms, e.g., &quot;Clinical Trial&quot;), Secondary identifiers, (MeSH terms), Language, Country of the Journal or publication history (e-publication date, print journal publication date).

====Publication Type: Clinical queries/systematic reviews====
Publication type parameter allows searching by the type of publication, including reports of various kinds of clinical research.

====Secondary ID====
Since July 2005, the MEDLINE article indexing process extracts identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called Secondary Identifier (SI). The secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data, gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial IDs. For clinical trials, PubMed extracts trial IDs for the two largest trial registries: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT identifier) and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register (IRCTN identifier).

=== See also ===
A reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and &quot;related articles&quot; can be identified. If relevant, several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated (on PubMed or any of the other NCBI Entrez databases) using the &#x27;Find related data&#x27; option. The related articles are then listed in order of &quot;relatedness&quot;. To create these lists of related articles, PubMed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation, as well as the MeSH headings assigned, using a powerful word-weighted algorithm. The &#x27;related articles&#x27; function has been judged to be so precise that the authors of a paper suggested it can be used instead of a full search.

===Mapping to MeSH===
PubMed automatically links to MeSH terms and subheadings. Examples would be: &quot;bad breath&quot; links to (and includes in the search) &quot;halitosis&quot;, &quot;heart attack&quot; to &quot;myocardial infarction&quot;, &quot;breast cancer&quot; to &quot;breast neoplasms&quot;. Where appropriate, these MeSH terms are automatically &quot;expanded&quot;, that is, include more specific terms. Terms like &quot;nursing&quot; are automatically linked to &quot;Nursing [MeSH]&quot; or &quot;Nursing [Subheading]&quot;. This feature is called Auto Term Mapping and is enacted, by default, in free text searching but not exact phrase searching (i.e. enclosing the search query with double quotes). This feature makes PubMed searches more sensitive and avoids false-negative (missed) hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology.

PubMed does not apply automatic mapping of the term in the following circumstances: by writing the quoted phrase (e.g., &quot;kidney allograft&quot;), when truncated on the asterisk (e.g., kidney allograft*), and when looking with field labels (e.g., Cancer [ti]).

===My NCBI===
The PubMed optional facility &quot;My NCBI&quot; (with free registration) provides tools for
* saving searches
* filtering search results
* setting up automatic updates sent by e-mail
* saving sets of references retrieved as part of a PubMed search
* configuring display formats or highlighting search terms
and a wide range of other options. The &quot;My NCBI&quot; area can be accessed from any computer with web-access.
An earlier version of &quot;My NCBI&quot; was called &quot;PubMed Cubby&quot;.

===LinkOut===
LinkOut is an NLM facility to link and make available full-text local journal holdings. Some 3,200 sites (mainly academic institutions) participate in this NLM facility (), from Aalborg University in Denmark to ZymoGenetics in Seattle. Users at these institutions see their institution&#x27;s logo within the PubMed search result (if the journal is held at that institution) and can access the full-text. Link out is being consolidated with Outside Tool as of the major platform update coming in the Summer of 2019.

===PubMed Commons===
In 2016, PubMed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by PubMed. This feature was initially tested in a pilot mode (since 2013) and was made permanent in 2016. In February 2018, PubMed Commons was discontinued due to the fact that &quot;usage has remained minimal&quot;.

===askMEDLINE===
askMEDLINE, a free-text, natural language query tool for MEDLINE/PubMed, developed by the NLM, also suitable for handhelds.

=== PubMed identifier ===

A PMID (PubMed identifier or PubMed unique identifier) is a unique integer value, starting at codice_1, assigned to each PubMed record. A PMID is not the same as a PMCID (PubMed Central identifier) which is the identifier for all works published in the free-to-access PubMed Central.

The assignment of a PMID or PMCID to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content. PMIDs are assigned to letters to the editor, editorial opinions, op-ed columns, and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal, as well as peer-reviewed papers. The existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud, incompetence, or misconduct. The announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a PMID.

Each number that is entered in the PubMed search window is treated by default as if it were a PMID. Therefore, any reference in PubMed can be located using the PMID.

==Alternative interfaces==

The National Library of Medicine leases the MEDLINE information to a number of private vendors such as Embase, Ovid, Dialog, EBSCO, Knowledge Finder and many other commercial, non-commercial, and academic providers. , more than 500 licenses had been issued, more than 200 of them to providers outside the United States. As licenses to use MEDLINE data are available for free, the NLM in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range of alternative interfaces and 3rd party additions to PubMed, one of a very few large, professionally curated databases which offers this option.

Lu identifies a sample of 28 current and free Web-based PubMed versions, requiring no installation or registration, which are grouped into four categories:
# Ranking search results, for instance: eTBLAST; MedlineRanker; MiSearch;
# Clustering results by topics, authors, journals etc., for instance: Anne O&#x27;Tate; ClusterMed;
# Enhancing semantics and visualization, for instance: EBIMed; MedEvi.
# Improved search interface and retrieval experience, for instance, askMEDLINE BabelMeSH; and PubCrawler.

As most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on PubMed/MEDLINE data leased under license from the NLM/PubMed, the term &quot;PubMed derivatives&quot; has been suggested. Without the need to store about 90 GB of original PubMed Datasets, anybody can write PubMed applications using the eutils-application program interface as described in &quot;The E-utilities In-Depth: Parameters, Syntax and More&quot;, by Eric Sayers, PhD. Various citation format generators, taking PMID numbers as input, are examples of web applications making use of the eutils-application program interface. Sample web pages include Citation Generator – Mick Schroeder, Pubmed Citation Generator – Ultrasound of the Week, PMID2cite, and Cite this for me.

==Data mining of PubMed==

Alternative methods to mine the data in PubMed use programming environments such as Matlab, Python or R. In these cases, queries of PubMed are written as lines of code and passed to PubMed and the response is then processed directly in the programming environment. Code can be automated to systematically query with different keywords such as disease, year, organs, etc. 

For bulk processing, the full PubMed database is available as XML which can be downloaded from an FTP server. The annual baseline is released in December, followed by daily update files. 

In addition to its traditional role as a biomedical database, PubMed has become common resource for training biomedical language models. Recent advancements in this field include the development of models like PubMedGPT, a 2.7B parameter model trained on PubMed data by Stanford CRFM, and Microsoft&#x27;s BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT, which utilizes figure-caption pairs from PubMed Central for vision-language processing. These models demonstrate the significant potential of PubMed data in enhancing the capabilities of AI in medical research and healthcare applications. Such advancements underline the growing intersection between large-scale data mining and AI development in the biomedical field.

The data accessible by PubMed can be mirrored locally using an unofficial tool such as MEDOC.

Millions of PubMed records augment various open data datasets about open access, like Unpaywall. Data analysis tools like Unpaywall Journals are used by libraries to assist with big deal cancellations: libraries can avoid subscriptions for materials already served by instant open access via open archives like PubMed Central.

<doc id="503010" wikidata="Q4982181" url="?curid=503010" title="Bubba the Love Sponge">
<text>Bubba the Love Sponge Clem (born Todd Alan Clem, April 23, 1966) is an American radio personality who hosts &quot;The Bubba the Love Sponge Show&quot; on the radio station WWBA in Tampa, Florida, and the subscription service Bubba Army Radio. He can also be heard on Florida Man Radio.

==Early life==
Todd Alan Clem was born on April 23, 1966, in Warsaw, Indiana. His father, Doug Clem, was a factory worker and his mother, Jane Edmond, a schoolbus driver and Warsaw city department head; he has a sister, Tara. Clem&#x27;s parents divorced when he was young. In 1984, Clem graduated from Warsaw Community High School. He attended Indiana State University in Terre Haute, Indiana, with a plan to go into dentistry, but his best friend Larry Plummer told him he was better suited to a radio career, and he dropped out in his second year. Clem had a position at the campus radio station WISU, but before he became a full-time disc jockey, he worked at a van conversion shop, where he laid down carpets. He coached football at his former high school.

==Career==
===1986–1992: Early career===
In 1986, Clem worked as a bouncer and driver at Jubilation nightclub, where he picked up radio DJ &quot;Scary&quot; Kerry Gray, of whom he was a fan, and took him to the club. Once there, Clem noticed people gravitating toward Gray. Gray gave Clem an on-air shift as an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke on April 1, 1986, at WPFR-FM in Terre Haute as Rockin&#x27; Bubba Clem, a name someone else had suggested. Clem became Gray&#x27;s intern, making studio visits, answering phone calls, and sitting in on the show. He accepted a position hosting weekends soon after, and began a part-time midday shift starting on Christmas Day in 1986. He became the station&#x27;s managing director. At a fraternity party, Gray called Clem a &quot;love sponge&quot; after witnessing the female attention Clem received.

After WPFR, Clem had a stint at WGRD-FM in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was fired on December 21, 1988, after a 13-year-old girl called into his show and Clem made sexual remarks about her. In 1989, Clem landed a spot at KTFM in San Antonio, Texas, where he was encouraged to trademark his air name and borrowed $5,000 from his parents to file a federal trademark for &quot;Bubba the Love Sponge&quot;. He worked evenings at WBBM-FM in Chicago, followed by a stint at WIOQ in Philadelphia from March to June 1990. The station let him go as management thought his style was not what they were looking for. Clem took legal action, and received $75,000 from WIOQ.

Clem worked nights at WXXL in Orlando, Florida, where he averaged 53,000 regular listeners. He left the station in May 1991. In August 1991, he returned to Chicago on WYTZ as the morning host, but the position lasted under three months before management rebranded the station. Clem then moved to WLUM-FM in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

===1992–1996: WFLZ-FM Tampa===
In September 1992, Clem started work from 7 to 11 p.m. at WFLZ-FM in Tampa, Florida, where his show gained popularity, particularly among teenagers. His first major contract signed during this time was worth $100,000 a year. Clem and WFLZ host Tom Steele were temporarily suspended to settle legal issues from their ongoing on-air feud.

Clem became involved in various business ventures. In December 1994, he invested $50,000 to open Sponges, an alcohol-free nightclub for teenagers in Largo, Florida. He opened a second Sponges in Spring Hill in 1995. He performed with his rap band Boyz Wit Da Bass there. Clem was involved in an endorsement deal with an Isuzu car dealership, the Bubba the Love Sponge Limousines service, a personalized paging service called the Air Bubba Beeping Network, and a premium-rate telephone line. In June 1995, Clem released an adult-oriented home video, &quot;Let Your Chia Run Wild&quot;, described as a &quot;private collection of events documenting a lifestyle that some can only dream of&quot; and featuring some nudity. Clem regretted his decision to release it, and WFLZ requested Clem cease its distribution. In April 1996, he opened Bubba&#x27;s Beach Club, a dance club and nightspot in Ybor City. In September 1996, Clem quit WFLZ.

===1996–2004: WXTB Tampa===
Clem decided to remain in Tampa, partly because he had other business ventures there. He started a morning show at WXTB in December 1996, and continued to host a pre-recorded show that was syndicated in six other cities, including Cincinnati, Toledo, Columbus, Louisville, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.

In June 1997, Jacor Communications was fined $4,000 for airing Clem&#x27;s discussions of having sex with a lesbian couple on February 25. In October 1998, Citicasters, WXTB&#x27;s owner, was fined $23,000 for various broadcasts, including one from May 1997 that included one of the crew describing their enema experience. This was followed by a $4,000 fine for a June 12, 1997, show that had a woman masturbating over the phone, and a $7,000 fine in 1999 for a May 28, 1998, segment that involved a caller ordering a sex doll.

By mid-1999, Clem had received four &quot;Billboard&quot; Personality of the Year awards. He was earning six figures and owned two nightclubs, one of them Planet Bubba in Spring Hill. His radio show crew included Mike &quot;Cowhead&quot; Calta, Mike &quot;Manson&quot; Waters, Whitey Pippen, Scotty the Body, Matt &quot;Spiceboy&quot; Loyd, Anita Wadd and Ned. In November 2000, Clem was a candidate to succeed the Pinellas County sheriff.

In January 2001, Clem&#x27;s show entered national syndication on stations in Jacksonville, Orlando, Hartford, West Palm Beach, Ft. Myers, Wichita, Kansas, Shreveport, and Macon, Georgia.

In February 2002, Clem was faced with animal cruelty charges following the February 27, 2001, broadcast, which featured the Bubba&#x27;s Road Kill Barbecue. The show involved the on-air castration and killing of a feral hog a hunter had captured in the station&#x27;s parking lot, and sound effects of hogs feeding were broadcast to have listeners believe it was being harassed and aggravated. The hog was cooked and eaten by the crowd present. Clem, his executive producer Brent Hatley, and two others present were charged with felony animal cruelty. A jury acquitted them in March.

In January 2004, the FCC issued a $755,000 fine to Clear Channel Communications for objectionable comments from July 19, 2001. The fine consisted of the maximum $27,500 fine for each of the 26 stations that aired the segments, plus $40,000 for record-keeping violations. The segment involved sexual discussions among the cartoon characters Alvin and the Chipmunks, George Jetson, and Scooby-Doo, among others. Clem was fired on February 23. At the time he had the number one show in the Tampa area in the 18–54-year-old male demographic.

===2004–2010: Hiatus and Sirius Satellite Radio===
In July 2004, Clem announced he would run for Pinellas County sheriff again.

In September 2005, Howard Stern announced the hiring of Clem to host weekday afternoons on Howard 101, his second channel on Sirius Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service exempt from FCC regulations. The show launched on January 9, 2006.

In 2008, Clem began to host two shows a day, which lasted one year. He and his crew aired an FCC-compliant show on WHPT in the morning, followed by the uncensored program on Sirius in the afternoon. In 2009, Sirius opted for just FM replays during the week and one live uncensored show on Friday afternoons. In December 2010, Clem did not renew his contract with Sirius, moving to RadioIO, an Internet radio service of which his agent Thomas Bean was CEO.

===2008–2019: Return to terrestrial radio===
Clem began broadcasting a live morning show from Tampa radio station WHPT 102.5 &quot;The Bone&quot; on January 8, 2008, which was simulcast on the Jacksonville radio station WFYV-FM 104.5 &quot;Rock 105&quot;. During the second quarter of 2008, Bubba&#x27;s show received a number one rating in the Tampa market; in 2015, the show&#x27;s ratings came under investigation for possible Nielsen Ratings tampering. In December 2016 his show was canceled on his local Tampa station, WBRN.

In July 2019, it was announced that JVC Broadcasting would acquire WORL 660 AM in Greater Orlando (and its FM translator) for $900,000. As previous owner Salem is retaining rights to the WORL call letters; the WDYZ (AM) calls from a sister station were swapped to WORL. JVC announced that it planned to launch a new hot talk format on the station, Florida Man Radio, featuring Bubba the Love Sponge in the morning. Programming is also heard on a 250-watt FM translator, W288CJ at 105.5 FM.

===2011–present: Bubba Army Radio===

Clem announced on January 3, 2011, he would have an internet show on RadioIO and feature several programming features throughout the day starting on January 10, 2011. 
On 3 January 2012 he has renewed his contract with Cox Media Group (CMG) Tampa&#x27;s 102.5 FM https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2012/01/03/tampa-bay-area-shock-jock-bubba-the-love-sponge-renews-deal-with-cox-radio-for-three-years/
In August 2013 an audiotape was released on YouTube of Clem voicing a commercial for Vermont Teddy Bear. In the commercial Clem makes racist remarks; he denied being racist, saying, &quot;I never said the word in that manner, ever.&quot; He believed the audio was leaked from &quot;someone who had access to [his] world&quot; and that audio bits were taken from recordings when he worked at Clear Channel. Clem&#x27;s company, Bubba Radio Network, ordered the removal of the video from YouTube. It is now hosted on TMZ.

On February 13, 2017, WWBA became the new flagship station of Bubba the Love Sponge Show after WBRN dropped the show. The show also airs live on Twitch and on sister station WHBO.

In July 2019, co-host Mike &quot;Manson&quot; Waters, who also did the voice of Ned, left the show.

On August 23, 2019, Janessa Brazil joined the show as the new co-host. She left for family reasons on December 13, 2019.

At the start of 2020, Seth Kushner joined &quot;The Bubba The Love Sponge Show&quot; as a daily co-host, while &#x27;Babyface&#x27; Brian Motroni, aka &quot;Coronavirus Virus survivor&quot;, Dan Diaco, Jay Diaco and Steve Diaco make regular appearances throughout the week. Longtime contributor Lummox also makes daily appearances.

In February 2021, co-host Seth Kushner left the show.

===Other ventures===

====Total Nonstop Action Wrestling====
On January 3, 2010, Bubba announced on his Twitter account that he had signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as a backstage interviewer. He made his debut the following day on the special live, three-hour Monday night edition of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, participating in four short backstage segments.

On January 16, 2010, Clem tweeted about the 2010 Haiti earthquake, saying he had tired of hearing about relief efforts for the people of Haiti, writing, &quot;Fuck Haiti&quot;, and calling the ensuing deaths of Haitians a &quot;cleanse.&quot; He later apologized, but TNA management nonetheless temporarily removed him from the air.

On January 19, 2010, Clem claimed that he had been blindsided and physically assaulted by Awesome Kong while backstage for the taping of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; the previous day. According to all three, the altercation was because of Clem&#x27;s tweets about Haiti. On February 25, news broke that Awesome Kong had filed a lawsuit against Clem for an alleged threatening phone call. On &quot;The Cowhead Show&quot;, Clem confronted Kong.

Clem returned to TNA television as the personal interviewer of wrestling stable The Band, in late March, only to be fired from the company on April 30, 2010, as a result of the Cowhead Show incident.

===Motorsports===
In 2011, Clem and an investor group bought the 3/8 dirt oval Ocala Speedway, which they renamed Bubba Raceway Park.

==Legal issues==
===Lawsuits===
In October 2006, Clem was sued by pornographic film actress Hope Miller, known professionally as Brooke Skye. She alleged that while performing on a radio program together with porn actress Melissa Harrington, Harrington penetrated her with an oversized sex toy against her will at Clem&#x27;s urging. In 2007, a judge turned down a request by Clem&#x27;s attorneys to dismiss the lawsuit, indicating that there was enough evidence that Miller had a legitimate claim. The case was eventually voluntarily dismissed with prejudice.

In 2007, Clem was sued for defamation by competitor disc jockey Todd Schnitt over on-air remarks Clem made about Schnitt&#x27;s family. A court ruled in Clem&#x27;s favor, and Schnitt vowed to appeal. In March 2013, after 13 hours of negotiations, Clem settled with Schnitt.

In October 2015, Nielsen sued Clem for $1 million over allegations of tampering with the ratings system by offering to pay several Nielsen panelists to manipulate the ratings by saying they listened to his show more than they did. Clem admitted to paying one person to manipulate the ratings, but Nielsen claimed he influenced several. Clem&#x27;s lawyer filed a motion asking that Nielsen&#x27;s lawsuit be dismissed, but it was denied by a judge. After years of trial delays, Clem and Nielsen settled out of court on July 6, 2018.

=== Hulk Hogan sex tape===

In early 2012, it was reported that Clem had secretly filmed his wife Heather Clem and Hulk Hogan having sex in his bedroom. On October 4, 2012, Gawker released a short clip of the video. In the clip, Clem can be heard saying that the couple can &quot;do their thing&quot; and he will be in his office. At the end of the video, Clem can be heard telling Heather, &quot;If we ever need to retire, here is our ticket&quot;. Hogan filed a lawsuit against the Clems for invading his privacy on October 15, 2012. Clem settled the suit on October 29, 2012. Following the settlement, Clem publicly apologized to Hogan. Hogan sued Gawker Media for publishing the tape, and a jury of six awarded Hogan more than $140 million in March 2016. Gawker announced it would appeal as it was &quot;disappointed&quot; that the jury was unable to hear Clem&#x27;s testimony, but ultimately settled with Hogan for $31 million in November 2016.

==Personal life==
In October 1998, Clem legally changed his name to Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. That year, he lost 148 pounds, going from 488 to 340. Clem does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs.

Clem has been married twice; his first marriage lasted 91 days. He said &quot;things got sticky&quot; after he wanted to make it in radio and had to develop in different cities and his wife preferred to stay in Terre Haute. In January 2007, Clem married model Heather Cole at the First Baptist Church of St. Petersburg, Florida. Hulk Hogan was Clem&#x27;s best man. The couple agreed to separate in March 2011, and Clem filed for divorce that September. Clem has a son from a previous relationship; Hogan is his godfather.

In 2012, Clem started a four-year relationship with Nicole L&#x27;Ange. In February 2017, she requested an order of protection against Clem, claiming he had abused her &quot;emotionally and physically&quot;. Clem denied the allegations, and the case was settled out of court that March.

In June 2017, Clem put his St. Petersburg home up for sale.

<text>The Yellow Line, also known as the Skokie Swift, is a branch of the Chicago &quot;L&quot; train system in Chicago, Illinois. The route runs from the Howard Terminal on the north side of Chicago, through the southern part of Evanston and to the Dempster Terminal in Skokie, Illinois, making one intermediate stop at Oakton Street in downtown Skokie.

At Howard, Yellow Line passengers can transfer to the Purple or Red Lines of the &quot;L&quot;. The Yellow Line is the only &quot;L&quot; line that does not go to The Loop and is the only &quot;L&quot; train route that is fully ADA accessible. It is also unique in that it runs in a below-grade trench for part of its length, even though it has no underground portions and does not run in an expressway median. It also includes grade segments and crossings at the western portion of the line. It was built using the tracks of the former Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad&#x27;s high-speed Skokie Valley Route.

Extending the line to Old Orchard Mall in Skokie has been discussed. From its original opening in 1925 until 1948, the line had several intermediate stops in Evanston and Skokie, but these stations have long been out of use and dismantled. In June 2010, however, construction began on a new station at Oakton, which opened on April 30, 2012.

Trains operate using the Bombardier-built 5000-series railcars; each train consists of two cars. Average weekday boardings of 1,239 were reported in 2023, making it by far the least-used route in the CTA rail system. Until late 2009, the Yellow Line was operated with the 3200-series cars that were specially equipped with roof boards that, until late 2004, held pantographs (the roof boards remain on cars 3441-3456 to this day even after they were officially reassigned to the Brown Line). Occasionally, the Yellow Line borrows cars from the Red Line when short on cars.

==Route==
The Yellow Line begins at the Dempster-Skokie terminal located at 5005 Dempster Street in Skokie. A stub track extends north of the station to allow trains to reverse. The line runs south from Dempster-Skokie at street level. After crossing Oakton Street, the Yellow Line turns east and crosses over Skokie Boulevard (U.S. Route 41). After the East Prairie Road grade crossing, the tracks rise to become an elevated route. 

At this point, the route passes the Skokie Shops CTA maintenance facility and crosses over the North Shore Channel. After passing over Dodge Avenue, the tracks descend into a trench. The line remains in the trench for about , then passes under the Metra Union Pacific/North Line and Purple Line tracks to enter Howard Yard. The line then rises to serve the elevated Howard station. A small segment extends south of the station to allow Yellow and Purple Line trains to reverse.

==Operating hours and headways==
The Yellow Line operates between Dempster-Skokie and Howard daily between 4:45 a.m. and 11:15 p.m. on weekdays, and between 6:15 a.m. and 11:15 p.m. on weekends and holidays. Service frequencies range from six trains per hour during rush hour to four trains per hour during other times.

==History==

===Niles Center Branch===
The Yellow Line originally began as the Niles Center Branch of the old Chicago Rapid Transit Company (CRT). The rapid transit service began as part of the Chicago, North Shore, and Milwaukee Railroad&#x27;s high-speed Skokie Valley interurban line on a five-mile (8 km) section between Howard Terminal and Dempster Street, Niles Center. It was placed in operation on March 28, 1925.

The route included several intermediate stops through Evanston and Skokie (then called Niles Center) at Ridge, Asbury, Dodge, Crawford/East Prairie, Kostner, Oakton and Main. On March 27, 1948, the Chicago Transit Authority (who had just bought out the Chicago Rapid Transit Company in 1947) discontinued service over the Niles Center Branch and replaced it with the 97 Skokie bus route. The stations were closed and remained abandoned for the next 15 years.

On January 21, 1963, the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad ceased all of its operations and later that year, of trackage between Howard and Dempster was purchased by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). The intermediate stations were not reopened. Some of the vacant station houses were used by other businesses, including a convenience store and an electrical supplier, before finally being demolished in the 1980s.

===The Skokie Swift===

The Skokie Swift high-speed ( in minutes) shuttle service, between Howard Street in Chicago and Dempster Street in Skokie, was inaugurated on April 20, 1964, as a federally-aided mass transportation demonstration project. Participation in the net project costs was divided between the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, CTA and the Village of Skokie.

The success of this project had attracted nationwide attention. On its first day of service, Skokie Swift carried nearly 4,000 passengers in a 16-hour period compared to approximately 1,600 passengers carried by the North Shore Line from the Dempster Terminal in a 12-hour period before the railroad terminated. Ridership continued to increase and by the end of the first year, nearly 6,000 passengers were riding the new line each weekday.

Because of the weekday success, Saturday service was inaugurated, with more than 2,000 riders. At the end of the two-year experimental period, 3.5 million people had used the new service and CTA authorized operation of the Skokie Swift as a permanent part of its rapid transit system.

The success of the Skokie Swift route demonstrated that many motorists will forsake their cars when high-speed mass transit is provided and to a minor extent, gave birth to the first use of &quot;light rail&quot; before the term was ever coined.

One of the distinctive features of the five-mile (8 km) line was that approximately half was equipped with third rail while the other half was equipped with catenary left over from the Chicago North Shore &amp; Milwaukee Railroad. Trains switched non-stop from third rail to overhead and vice versa using distinctive pan trolleys designed by Skokie Swift Project Manager George Krambles.

On February 9, 1992, Saturday service was discontinued during a service reduction by CTA. The &quot;Skokie Swift&quot; name was changed to the &quot;Yellow Line&quot; in 1993, when all Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; lines were renamed for colors. The original name and logo of the Skokie Swift continues to be used today on station signage and route displays for Skokie-bound trains, making the Yellow Line the only &quot;L&quot; line to officially retain its original name. The Dempster Street Terminal was completely rebuilt from 1993 to 1994, with a new station house and train platforms. In 2003, the old brick station building (designed by architect Arthur U. Gerber) was moved to the east, then was restored and converted into commercial property.

The Skokie Swift was the only CTA rapid transit line to use overhead catenary for electrification. It was also the last CTA rapid transit line to use overhead, as portions of the Evanston and Lake Street lines used conventional trolley overhead until 1973 and 1962, respectively. Third-rail electrification was installed in 2004 to increase reliability, allow compatibility with other rapid-transit lines and reduce maintenance costs.

In 2008, Saturday service was restored and brand new Sunday service was added.

====Addition of downtown Skokie station====
A groundbreaking ceremony marking the start of construction of a new intermediate stop on the Yellow Line, Oakton–Skokie, took place on June 21, 2010. The station is located in downtown Skokie and was the first new CTA station built since 2001. The new station opened on April 30, 2012.

===Incidents===
====2015 embankment collapse====
On May 17, 2015, a section of the embankment west of McCormick Boulevard collapsed, causing the entire track to be damaged. The collapse was due to a failure in construction at the adjacent O&#x27;Brien Water Reclamation Plant. No trains could operate either way due to the track condition. At 10:00 PM on that day, an emergency closure of the Yellow Line was called. Yellow Line service returned on October 30, 2015, with the CTA offering free rides for one week and free parking at the Dempster-Skokie Terminal through the end of 2015.

====2023 collision====

On November 16, 2023, a southbound Yellow Line train collided with a CTA snowplow, resulting in 38 injuries. The Yellow Line was promptly suspended and replaced with bus shuttles. Train service was eventually restored on January 5, 2024; however, the top speed of the train is reduced from to .

===Canceled projects===
====Additional infill station====
Upon the successful reopening of the Oakton station, it was determined that stations at Dodge, Asbury or Ridge in southern Evanston could be built or rebuilt and added to the Yellow Line as well. In 2012, a local study found Asbury to be the most feasible of the three potential southern Evanston Yellow Line stations. , the CTA website does not indicate that the Asbury project is being considered.

====Extension to Old Orchard====
In 2006, the Chicago Transit Authority was reviewing plans to extend the Yellow Line north from the current end-of-line terminal at Dempster–Skokie to a new end-of-line terminal at Old Orchard Mall, a distance of about . After August 2008, two corridors remained for further study, the alignment along the Union Pacific Railroad (bus and heavy rail) as well as a combined track along Gross Point Road and Skokie Blvd (bus only). , the two corridors have been narrowed down to one option – an elevated single track rail corridor that will follow the Union Pacific Railroad right of way. Under the most recent version of the plan, the Old Orchard terminal would be elevated.

, the CTA is no longer studying the extension.

==D-Day and Pegasus Bridge==
Bénouville was the scene of the first – and possibly most vital – battle of the Allied invasion of Europe on D-Day, 6 June 1944 and the night before. From 12.15 am (British Double Summertime = 5 June at 23:15 hrs. German/Middle-European time), a reinforced company of glider-borne troops from the 2nd Batt. Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, led by Major Reginald John Howard, landed around the bridge over the Caen Canal at Bénouville in three Horsa gliders and captured it from the Germans in a swift and dramatic attack. Control of this bridge was vital to the success of the whole Operation Overlord invasion, because it would be the route of any German counter-attack eventually with their &quot;Panzers&quot; against the seaborne forces which were due to start landing a few hours later on Sword.

At the same time, another Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire glider-borne force of sixty men (one glider was wrongly released near Varaville at the Dives River) captured the neighbouring bridge over the River Orne – about a quarter of a mile away near Ranville – which was also of vital strategic importance. The Caen Canal bridge was later renamed Pegasus Bridge by Royal Engineers, in honour of the winged horse symbol of the Airborne Forces, while the River Orne bridge was many years later renamed Horsa Bridge, after the type of glider which carried the men to war.

Today, Pegasus Bridge and the nearby Café Gondrée are the scene of many pilgrimages and commemoration ceremonies, particularly around 6 June. Its wartime inhabitants were members of a local resistance group and passed the information on the canal bridge unto a cell in Caen and from there to England. A few hundred yards across Pegasus Bridge lies the modern Musée Mémorial Pegasus. As for the Café Gondrée, on D-Day itself, Monsieur and Mme Gondrée who lived in the café were woken up by the landing of the gliders. Monsieur Gondrée looked out of a window and saw black &quot;masked&quot; troops running over the bridge, which he later learned were British paratroopers. In celebration, he also dug up some 99 bottles of champagne which he had hidden in the garden and in the morning of 6 June toasted his liberation with some of the men from the gliders.

The Gondrées had three daughters and one of them, Arlette, took over the café from her parents and maintained it as a memorial to the men who landed on 6 June 1944. (Her picture is in the Holt&#x27;s Normandy Battlefield Guide Book published by Pen and Sword). To this day, it also remains a working café. For many years after the war Major John Howard could be found in the café for the 6 June anniversary and even today many veterans and current members of the Airborne Forces still visit Gondrée Café or one of the other bars in the immediate vicinity.

<text>Bény-sur-Mer (, literally &quot;Bény on Sea&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region, in northwestern France. It lies 5 km south of Bernières-sur-Mer and 13 km north of Caen.

==World War II==
During World War II, Bény-sur-Mer was liberated on D-Day by &quot;Le Régiment de la Chaudière&quot;, a French Canadian unit. There was a gun battery located near the town at the time.

===D-Day: morning===
Although garrisoned during the Occupation, Beny-sur-Mer did not play a central role in a major tactical confrontation on D-Day. Instead, the village witnessed three noteworthy incidents on that day. To the northeast, a prolonged struggle unfolded at Château-de-Tailleville (WN 23) before Beny-sur-Mer&#x27;s security was assured. Directly to its west, a brief encounter occurred at WN 28a later in the day. Additionally, early in the morning, two battalions from the 716 Infantry Division encountered a transformative shift in their day due to Naval Gunfire.

*Kompanie 8 (schwere). / Battalion II./ Grenadier-Regiment 736., commanded by Hauptmann Johann Grzeski, the Ballation reserve, was sited at Les Ruines Saint-Ursin: La Haye de Saule (at North 49.3078 Deg / West 00.4386 Deg), in a ‘Open Field Earth (Hinzu kommen Positionen in offener Feldstellung) Fa Position’. It is reported that at 0510 hrs HQ Stab Btl II. / 736 reported, to HQ 716 Inf.Div., of airborne landings south of Bernières-sur-Mer (WN 28) and north of the Chateau-de-Tailleville (WN 23) inferring enemy troopers had penetrated up into Bernières-sur-Mer. Consistent with tactical doctrine, the Kdr. Btl II./ 736., ordered Ko 8./II 736. to mount a counterattack, and destroy the threat (... ‘no one is to wait, for higher…’). Though the details of the action are not confirmed, it is suggested that Ko 8. was lost. Committed, from a well dug-in position, in its action, moving across open ground, it would have taken naval gun fire, from HMS Kempenfelt, it shelling Kompanie 3. (Flak)/Pz.Jg.-Abt.716., at la-Tomblette. ‘Nobody returned … so the details are not known.’ Kdr 716 Inf.Div.
*3. (FlaK) Kompanie. / Panzerjäger-Abteilung 716., on Le Pommeret (la Tomblette) was sited on the low ridge overlooking the beaches from St. Aubin to Courseulles, north of Beny-sur-Mer, under the leadership of the Oberleutnant Kurt Kaergel, his Panzerjäger-Abteilung 716, Gefechtsstand: Sallenelles. The primary target of HMS Kempenfelt, its two platoons were shelled at 06h19 BST, in positions at N 49.3026Deg / W 0.4238Deg and at N 49.3015Deg / W 0.4202Deg.
**Züg - 3. (Flak) Kp. /Pz.Jg.-Abt.716. x6 7.5 cm D.C.A. Mle 1938(f) Static AA guns, in a field emplacement.
**Züg - 3. (Flak) Kp. /Pz.Jg.-Abt.716. x20 3.2 cm Wurfgerät 40/41, set up in Packkiste, in an open field emplacement.

Late in the Occupation, Beny-sur-Mer garrisoned a German a [Hauptkolonnen (Main) or Saunderkolonnen (Special) 160] supply transportation unit assigned from LXXXIV Armeekorps (Stab: St. Lô), to KVA H1 Caen. Located centrally to the work and units of Infantry-Division 716, a sub-unit of Kw.Trsp.Kp. 4./ Kw.Trsp.Abt. 564., it was noted to be in Beny-sur-Mer on D-Day. The supply and transport services of Occupation Static Divisions (Coastal Defense) were organized on the design that artillery batteries were not moved; as such artillery ammunition and the troop supply trains were not well resourced. From 1941, the priority for motorized and horse-drawn transport was for Divisions fighting in Russia; with almost no additional vehicles available for Divisions on occupation duty, in France. While a ‘standard’ Division Supply Column (Trains) should see up to eight motor transport columns, when mobilized in 1941, Inf.Div. 716., was allocated no supply commander, and only one motor transport column.

*Kraftwagen-Transport-Abteilung 564 (Motor Vehicle Transport Battalion: Kw.Trsp.Abt.564.) was established (Aufstellung) in June 1941 in Wehrkreis IV: Dresden, and assigned to Heerestruppe bei der Heeresgruppe B im Westen (H.Gr.B - La Roche Guyon). In December 1941, it added Kompanien 3. (FN 44363 aus WK IX: Kassel) and Kompanien 4. (FN 45651 aus WK VI: Münster) and in May 1943, designated ‘z. b. V.’ (zur besonderer Verwendung: for special purposes / for special use). With an OB West February 1944 reorganization: Kraftwagen-Transport-Regiment z.b.V. West., (Standarten) was established (in France) regrouping its three Kw.Trsp.Abt, fielding 13 Companies. The new Kw.Trsp.Rgt. West was designated Heeresgruppen-Truppen beim OB West (Paris: St Germain-en-Laye), commanded by General des Transportwesens West. Consequently, Kw.Trsp.Abt. 564 z.b.V. (Versorgungstruppen Nu. 21108010) was assigned (directly) as (Unterstellung): Kw.Trsp.Abt 564 (Stab Paris: Rueil-Malmaison) to 7. Armee (Stab: Le Mans) in der Kompanie NSKK (Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps) Transportabteilung zur Wehrmacht.
**AOK 7 allocated Kraftwagen Transport Kompanie 4., to LXXXIV Armeekorps (Stab: St. Lô) for employment with NSKK Transportkorps Speer, supporting allocated Divisions in defence and construction of Coastal fortifications. Feldpostnummern FN 45651 was first used in July 1941, assigned to 4.Kompanie Kraftwagen-Transport-Abteilung z.b.V. 564 (zur besonderer Verwendung). It changed designation in March 1942 to 4. Kompanie Kraftwagen-Transport-Abteilung 564. With a further reorganization, in October 1943, it was deleted, as a standalone unit in the Field Postal Directory (with the eventual forming of Kraftwagen-Transport-Regiment West).

===D-Day: around noon===
 Widerstandnesten WN 23 was located at North 49.308275 Degrees / West 00.409888 Degrees and in June 1944, for targeting purposes, at: LZ1 vT MR Grid 003823 (Ref. GSGS 4250 1:50K: Creully Sheet 7E/5). The (WN) - Resistance Nest at the Château-de-Tailleville (de la colonie) was a unique ‘platoon-sized’ position, incorporating standard concrete (Verstärkt Feltmessig: Vf Type 2) gun casemates, with well-sited observation and crewed fighting positions. Located to dominate the roads entering the town, the position did dispose of an integrated network of trenches and tunnels, partially surrounded by a stone wall, permitting unobserved movement under cover.

Hauptmann Deptolla, Kommandeur Bataillon II./ 736., defending with only his Stabs-züg (Lt Heinz Rix, Karl Rub), and the Stabs-kompanie, perhaps undermanned, would cause problems all day for the Canadians. Planning to fight with his west flank secured by Kompanie 8.(schwere)/ II 736., at Les Ruines Saint-Ursin, off to the west, his right flank by Kompanie 12.(schwere)/ Bataillon III./736., to the east, in front of Douvres (WN 23a), and drawing ‘artillery’ support from Kompanie 3.(Flak)/Pz.Jg.-Abt.716., to his immediate west, he found himself alone. Having been located and well targeted, in 3rd Canadian Infantry Division planning, the fight for WN 23 was first impacted by Naval Counter Battery Gun Fire from the destroyer HMS Kempenfelt (R03) (at 06h19m), she shelling Kompanie 3 (Flak)./Pz.Jg.-Abt.716., sited in an open field emplacement, at Tailleville-la-Tomblette. This followed later in the morning by RAF Medium (Day) Bombers at 07h55 (BST).

WN 23 was overcome by the efforts of &#x27;C&#x27; Company, The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment (O.C. Major Daughney), landing at Saint Aubin-sur-Mer at 09h45. When able to bypass the fight for WN 27, intending to make a quick run to Tailleville, ‘C’ Company, The North Shore Regiment, was attached a tank troop from &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron, The Fort Garry Horse. First reporting contact around noon, moving South, at MR Grid 004823, enemy mortars slowed the advance, the ‘C’ Sqn tanks moved-up, giving the necessary fire and moral support to get the North Shores up to the Chateau. Getting into the position at 13h52, a Sherman tank penetrated the walls, fronting the Chateau grounds, and shot up the trenches and their defenders with high explosive shells, at point blank range. After six hours of fighting, the remnants of the garrison surrendering, ‘C’ Company ‘secured’ Tailleville, at 17h30. &#x27;D&#x27; Company was moved up to Tailleville on the east flank, as &#x27;A&#x27; Company had previously sealed off the southern side of the position.

Having consolidated on the position, ‘C’ Company captured 4 Officers and 57 other prisoners, this reported at 20h10. It continued to root in the underground workings of the Château; around 23h00 producing more prisoners, including two wounded monocled officers. At 23h30 all of &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron, The Fort Garry Horse, moved into position with the North Shores, the squadron laagered and passed an uncomfortable night constantly on the alert in expectation of a German counterattack. The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment lost 34 killed and 90 wounded in the fight for WN 23.

German Crew Served Weapons at Châteaux de Tailleville.

===D-Day: at dusk===
Le Regiment de la Chaudiere (8 CIB Reserve), at Bernières-sur-Mer, by 10h30, forming up with &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron, The Fort Garry Horse moved South towards Beny-sur-Mer, encountering significant resistance, in exiting the town. While its Company ‘A’ (OC Major H. Lapointe), dealt with two very capable 8.8 cm Pak 43/41, in an open field emplacement, of Kompanie 2.(StuG) /Pz.Jg-Abt 716., sited just southwest of Berniers (on Les Perrucques), its ‘B&#x27; Company remained focused on its run to Beny-sur-Mer and WN28a. Having moved up with little difficulty, Company ‘B&#x27; Le Regiment de la Chaudiere (OC J.F. L’Esperance), ‘captured’ WN 28a by mid-afternoon, taking 54 prisoners. At the end of the day, The Fort Garry Horse were ordered back for rest and vehicle replenishment in Beny-sur-Mer, it was not until 01h00 07.06 that &#x27;B&#x27; squadron made it back, while ‘C’ Squadron remained in Tailleville. The Fort Garry Horse suffered 13 killed and 12 wounded casualties on D-Day.

Widerstandnesten WN 28a was located West of Beny-sur-Mer (Moulineaux), at North 49.293 Degrees / West 00.451 Degrees and in June 1944, for targeting purposes, at: French Lambert MR Grid LZ1 vT 972808 (Ref. GSGS 4250 1:50K: Creully Sheet 7E/5). The (WN) - Resistance Nest, its south approach protected by La Mue, was a doctrinally laid-out four gun German ‘batterie-sized’ tactical position, with perimeter crewed weapon fighting positions, and ammunition storage points. The four 100mm le.F.H14/19(t) Czech guns, with an effective range of 9,970m range, were disposed in Type 1 ‘Open’ Field Gun Earth Fa Emplacements (Geschutzestellungen), incorporating only one Type Heer 669 ‘Gun’ (Verstärkt Feltmessig: Vf Type 2) concrete casement. Located to support the landing defences at Courseulles-sur-Mer, Berniers-sur-Mer, and St Aubin-sur-Mer, the position did dispose of light crew-served weapons, in supporting trenches on its South flank.

While effectively manned by Batterie 7. (Resi). / Bataillon II. / 1716 AR, commanded by Hauptmann Wilhelm Franke, his contribution to the fights on the JUNO beaches did not go as planned. Its intended effect, on the five Mike and Nan beaches was effectively neutralized by Naval Counter Battery Gun Fire, specifically from the cruiser HMS Diadem (84) at 05h52, and then furthered bombed by RAF Medium / Fighter Bombers at 08h15. There was not much fight left when, approaching from the northeast, it was overcome Le Regiment de la Chaudiere.

In Beny-sur-Mer there remains two reminders of D-Day and June 1944.

* Bény-sur-Mer Canadian War Cemetery commemorates Canadian losses suffered on D-Day 1944 and subsequent battles in France. The cost in lives had been high, though not as high as had been estimated, on D-Day Canada suffered almost a thousand casualties, of whom 340 were killed or died of wounds.
* Beny-sur-Mer Airfield at 49°17&#x27;54&quot;N / 00°25&#x27;34&quot;W was a former Allied temporary invasion airfield, located 1 km north-northeast of Beny-sur-Mer in the Lower Normandy. The Airfield (ALG B4) was completed on 15 June 1944, it consisted of a 4,000&#x27; runway aligned 08Deg/35Deg, with dispersal areas, communications facilities, and landing lights, and was in continuous use until early August 1944.

<text>Fitzpatrick () is an Irish surname that most commonly arose as an anglicised version of the Irish patronymic surname Mac Giolla Phádraig () &quot;Son of the Devotee of (St.) Patrick&quot;.

In some cases, it may also have independently arisen by a similar anglicization of a likely-distinct Irish patronymic, Ó Maol Phádraig, &quot;Descendent of the Follower of (St.) Patrick&quot;, or in rare cases as a genuine Anglo-Irish patronymic incorporating the Norman French &quot;fiz&quot; (&#x27;son of&#x27;) and the male name Patrick.

Giolla Phádraig (meaning &quot;the devotee of [Saint] Patrick&quot;, also one of origins of the surname Kilpatrick) was the personal name of Gilla Patráic mac Donnchada, a tenth-century king of Ossory. His sons were subsequently styled &quot;Mac Giolla Phádraig&quot; (meaning, &quot;son of Giolla Phádraig&quot;), and gave rise to a dynasty of Kings of Ossory that bore this patronymic as a dynastic name. In the 16th century, as part of the process of king Henry VIII&#x27;s surrender and regrant scheme to anglicize the Irish nobility, some members of the clan were legally obligated to render their surname as Fitz-Patrick or Fitzpatrick as part of the agreed terms with the Crown. The Fitzpatrick surname may have also been adopted later amongst other unrelated Irish families, such as the Maguires of Fermanagh. Like the related Kilpatrick and Mulpatrick, the surname was sometimes shortened to Patrick.

The 1901 census of Ireland indicated the top five counties for the surname Fitzpatrick, by birth, were County Cavan, followed by counties Laois, Dublin, Down and Cork. Since 2019, the Fitzpatrick Clan Society has facilitated the registration of five Fitzpatrick clans with Clans of Ireland: the Mac Gilpatrick of Ulster – Mac Giolla Phádraig Ulaidh; the Fitzpatrick / O&#x27;Mulpatrick of Breifne – Ó Maol Phádraig Breifne; the Fitzpatrick / Mac Gilpatrick of the tribe of Cas – Mac Giolla Phádraig Dál gCais; the Fitzpatrick / Mac Gilpatrick of Leinster – Mac Giolla Phádraig Laighean; and, the Fitzpatrick of Upper Ossory.

<text>Bernières-sur-Mer (, literally &quot;Bernières on Sea&quot;), in the arrondissement of Caen, is a commune in the Calvados department of Normandy, in northwestern France. It is part of the canton of Courseulles-sur-Mer. It lies on the English Channel coast, 3 km east of Courseulles-sur-Mer, and 17 km north of Caen.

Bernières-sur-Mer is one of the oldest towns of the Côte de Nacre. Gallo-Roman traces are scattered on the territory of the municipality, and are visible in the cliffs of the &quot;Cape Romain&quot; east of the town. The Middle Ages saw the prosperity of Bernières - enjoying the magnificence of William the Conqueror. The Church of Bernières illustrates perfectly evolution of the region during the first half of the second millennium. In the early 20th century, served by the railway, its hotels and sandy beach, surrounded by dunes and the embankment welcomed visitors from across France.

The town was liberated by The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada on 6 June 1944 as part of the leading assault wave of D-Day Operation Overlord. Later, Le Régiment de la Chaudière, landed in reserve as part of the 8th Canadian Brigade, 3rd Canadian Division. The remains of the Atlantic Wall are still visible and are a place of remembrance where Berniérais honor each year the memory of the Canadians.

==History: World War II==
===The Occupation===
Across Calvados, the Occupation began a month before The June 1940 Armistice, it establishing first a German Occupied Zone and a Vichy Unoccupied Zone, retaining nominally the civil jurisdiction of Vichy over all of France, except for Alsace-Lorraine. The (German) Military Command in France: Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF), succeeding the Military Administration in France (Militärverwaltung in Frankreich), from the outset was the principal executive and decision-making protagonist in the (Northern) Occupied Zone. The presence of Vichy authorities allowed it to focus on the security of its occupying troops, and the efficient industrial economic exploitation of France. The ‘Occupied Zone’ was divided into Military Administration Districts (Militärverwaltungsbezirk), with Regional Oberfeldkommandanturen, they into Departmental Military Administration (FK. Feldkommandanturen) and they into the Military Administration Prefecture (KK. Kreiskommandanturen. All initially employed the Feldgendarmerie (FG. German Military Police) having local police powers, and the Geheime Feldpolizei (GFP. Secret Field Police), conducting important investigations, and later the Sicherheitspolizei (Sipo. Security Police of the Sicherheitsdienst SD. Security Service), persons arrested appeared before military tribunals, which had been set up in each Département (FK).

Bernières-sur-Mer sat inside the ‘Coastal Military Zone’ - set-out in the October 1941, along The Atlantic and The Channel Coasts, from the Basses-Pyrénées to the Pas-de-Calais / Nord; with a geographic depth extending up to 30 km. First designated as ‘Entry Prohibited’ – restricted to those who had lived there for at least three months (principal residents), civil service Vichy personnel, those working for the German army, and the personnel of the SNCF. In 1943 the MBK ordered a partial ‘evacuation’ of the Coastal Military Zone, in the interests of the French population &quot;…en cas d&#x27;événements graves dans les communes.&quot; All residents designated non-essential to public services, industrial enterprises, agriculture, forestry and supply services, had to depart by 30 April, targeting the most vulnerable, children and the elderly; though enforcement was uneven. The CMZ was classified as ‘Entry Forbidden’- except to ‘essential civilians’ in April 1944, some cities and towns designated for evacuation.

Basse Normandie fell within the rubric of Militärverwaltungsbezirk ‘Bezirk A’ - Nordwestfrankreich (North / West France) with its Headquarters (Stab) at Paris: St. Germain-en-Laye. Calvados-Baie de Seine came under an immediate Bezirk ‘A’ subordinate Oberfeldkommandanturen: Oberfeldkommandantur ‘Seine-Maritime’ (Stab. Rouen 1941). With an Feldkommandantur FK established in each Canton Prefecture, working with the Department Préfet, FK 723 Caen (Feldpostnummer 12067) was created on 20 May 1940, it tasked with the upholding of order and security, taking measures to prevent sabotage and anti-German activity. Feldkommandantur FK 723 Caen its City KK, Kreis-Kommandantur 884 Caen responsible for coastal towns of the JUNO Sector, also oversaw the ‘sous-préfectures’ du Calvados: Kreis-Kommandantur 789 Bayeux, Kreis-Kommandantur 774 Lisieux, Kreis-Kommandantur 763 Vire. This all changing in June 1942 with the arrival of The Sicherheitspolizei Sipo-SD Security Police and the centralization of repression, with their prime task of hunting of foreign agents. KdS (Kommandos der SIPO und des SD) were established across France, at the Regional (Provincial) Directorate Level. The Sipo-SD first established itself in Calvados through KdS Rouen (Seine-Maritime / Normandie) and its ‘Section Exterieures / Détachement’ Außendienststelle Caen (Département Calvados).

===D-Day===

At the beginning of the Battle of Normandy, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Rodney Keller, landed 15,000 Canadians and 9,000 British troops on the Calvados coast. Bernières-sur-Mer, one of five Canadian landing sites, was located to the eastern end of Canada&#x27;s assigned landing sector of Juno Beach. On D-Day, the 8th Canadian Infantry (Assault) Brigade Group, stormed the beach, landing The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, the 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse), and the guns of the 14th Canadian Field Regiment, RCA, to engage troops of the Bataillon II./Grenadier-Regiment 736, who garrisoned the town&#x27;s fortified &#x27;Resistance Nest&#x27;.

Widerstandnesten WN 28 (NAN White) was located at North 49.335696 Degrees / West 00.419942 Degrees and in June 1944 for targeting purposes was at: LCC MR Grid 997855 (Ref. GSGS 4250 1:50K: Creully Sheet 7E/5). The (WN) Resistance Nest at Bernières-sur-Mer was a reinforced platoon sized position, incorporating multiple concrete (Verstärkt Feltmessig: Vf Type 2) gun casemates, with additional observation and crewed fighting positions, located to dominate the beach exits, into town. A well prepared position, extending across much of the beach front, Hauptmann Rudolf Gruter, Kdr Kompanie 5./ Grenadier-Regiment 736./ Bataillon II., and his Ko Stab Gruppen located in Bernières, was well engaged, under naval bombardment, from before the Canadian H-Hr (07h55 BST). Having a wider frontage, the crew served weapon sites were not joined by an integrated network of trenches, but its rear was ‘protected’ by three fences of barbed wire. Approaches into the position were protected by three K.V. Gruppe Courseulles minefields. The left front (NW) sea approach, and beachfront, above the left seawall were protected by a large Beach Minefield: Mf 58. The right front (NE) land approach was protected Beach Minefield: Mf 57 and its rear and right flank by tactical minefield: Mf 55. A battalion heavy mortar detachment (Nest fur schweren Granatenwerfer) located 150 yards behind the beach, additionally supported the position, it protected by an anti-vehicle ditch, south of the railway line.

The coastline on which NAN White was set out is low lying, from Courseulles to Bernieres sur Mer there was a sandy beach with short groynes to prevent lateral movement of sand by the current. Offshore all the way along the coast eastwards of Bernieres sur Mer there were rocky outcrops parts of which were exposed at low tide: les Iles de Bernieres. WN 28 began to take indirect fire, from the LCT(Mk4) embarked SP (105mm) artillery of 14th Canadian Field Regiment, RCA from 07h44 BST, it having little effect on the defenders at MR 998852, as the position included five Unterstands Type R501/R502 Personnel Shelters. For 35 minutes they fired a steady barrage onto the beaches (H-30 to H+5), it not as tight as had been attained in some training exercises.

As programmed two volleys of 5&quot; Rocket Fire then arrived, to disrupt any movement about the position, and a volley of 60 lb Hedgerows fell about the flanks, cutting the wire entanglements and detonating the mines, securing the approaches onto the position and its casemates. Because the tide was much higher than expected and the beach narrow and congested, the assaulting companies did not initially benefit from direct fire support from ‘B’ Squadron, 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment, The Fort Garry Horse, as they did not arrive as planned.

The Resistance Nest was overcome by two companies of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, its ‘A’ Company (O.C. Major H. E. Dalton) landing at 08h12, west of WN 28a, (at MR Grid 989855) on an ‘open’ left flank, an unguarded German flank seldom to be found. Intending to land east of the town, between Bernières and St Aubin, ‘B’ Company (O.C. Major C.O. Dalton) landed directly on the edge of WN 28, at 08h15, taking 65 serious casualties, 200 yards east of their intended landing site (at MR Grid 998995). ‘A’ Company got off the beach quickly, taking heavy machine gun fire, over the grass fields, just east of WN 28, it reaching the railway line. Having been being pinned down by heavy mortar fire, by 08h45 BST, it &#x27;cleared&#x27; the road through the village at its southwest point. A weakened ‘B’ Company scaled the sea wall, got off the beach, and outflanking the most serious threats, got into town by 09h00 BST, having seen some support from &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron engaging casements and weapon-pits from their beach positions.

79 Armoured Division (UK) Assault Engineers, having landed two AVRE Teams it was almost 09h30 before the exits were open and &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron could move into town to support of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; Companies. Between 09h10 and 09h30, the self-propelled guns of 14th Field Regiment, RCA landed onto a narrow, crowded, and chaotic beach. Three batteries getting off the beach, they had 18 guns in action, to the right of Bernières by 11h30. The regiment spent most of the day in action in improvised gun areas close to Bernières, crest clearances hampering the action of the guns. Receiving the worst battering of any Canadian unit on D-Day, the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles suffered 60 killed and 78 wounded, in the fight for Bernières-sur-Mer.

German Crew Served Weapons at WN 28 Bernières-sur-Mer. The casements took innumerable direct hits, doing little more than denting the concrete.

WN 28b at Bernières-sur-Mer (West) was located at North 49Deg 20Min 04Sec and West 00Deg 25Min 40Sec and in June 1944 for targeting purposes was at: LCC MR Grid 993855 (Ref. GSGS 4250 1:50K: Creully Sheet 7E/5).

It did not contribute to fight at Bernières-sur-Mer (WN28), having been neutralized by the Task Force ‘J’ Naval Beach Bombardment Drenching Fire Programme, this before H-Hr at 07h55 BST. The landing of ‘A’ Company, The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, at MR Grid 989855, occurred west of this now abandoned position.
