<text>The East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) is a special district operating in Alameda County and Contra Costa County, California, within the East Bay area of the San Francisco Bay Area. It maintains and operates a system of regional parks which is the largest urban regional park district in the United States. The administrative office is located in Oakland.

As of 2020, EBRPD spans with 73 parks and over of trails. Some of these parks are wilderness areas; others include a variety of visitor attractions, with opportunities for swimming, boating and camping. The trails are frequently used for non-motorized transportation such as biking, hiking, and horse riding. More than of paved trails (identified as Interpark Regional Trails) through urban areas link the parks together.

==History==
A destructive grass fire that broke out in Wildcat Canyon blew west into Berkeley on September 17, 1923, and burned down 640 structures, mostly homes. The East Bay Water Company was harshly criticized for its failure to deliver enough water to successfully fight the fire. Much of the problem arose from having a system of small private water companies who obtained water either from their own wells or from runoff, then pumped the water to the water companies&#x27; wells, Chabot and Temescal. A state law was passed that enabled citizens of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties to create a special district that could obtain water from the Mokelumne River and pump it directly to customers. The East Bay Municipal District (EBMUD) was formed and approved by the electorate.

In 1930, the Olmsted Brothers and Ansel F. Hall created a &quot;Report on proposed park reservations for East Bay cities, California&quot; The EBRPD was founded in 1934, and acquired its first land two years later, when the East Bay Municipal Utility District sold of its surplus land. The founders of the district included Robert Sibley, a hiking enthusiast, Hollis Thompson, then Berkeley City Manager, and Charles Lee Tilden, among others. William Penn Mott Jr. served as director of the agency from 1962 to 1967, and oversaw a doubling of the system&#x27;s acreage from 10,500 to 22,000.

In June 2013, EBRPD purchased a tract of land formerly known as Roddy Ranch in east Contra Costa County. The tract lies south of Antioch and west of Brentwood. The cost was reported as $14.24 million. Funding will also be provided by California Wildlife Conservation Board and an unidentified private foundation. The acquisition does not include Roddy Ranch Golf Club or about 240 acres of privately owned land inside the project boundary. The East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservancy will install gates, fencing and signs around the tract in the coming year, while the sale is in escrow. The new area will likely be named Deer Valley Regional Park.

In 2016, Vargas Plateau Regional Park in Fremont was the first park ever to have been shut down as the result of legal action in the more than 80-year history of EBRPD. During 2014, EBRPD cut park hours on a temporary and interim basis to reduce public access to Mission Peak in Fremont, using a media strategy designed by political consultant George Manross. 

===2020 California Wildfires===
The parks in the East Bay Regional Park District were badly affected by the various lightning complex fires plaguing the Bay Area in August 2020. The fires enveloped the Bay Area in a layer of smoke and forced the closures of many national parks within the Bay Area including all parks in the East Bay Regional Parks District.
==Notable parks==
The parks administered by the EBRPD vary greatly in size and character. Particularly notable are the string of parks along the Berkeley Hills above and east of both Berkeley and Oakland, including Wildcat Canyon Regional Park, Tilden Regional Park, Robert Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve, Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve, and Redwood Regional Park.

There are also bay shore parks such as the Point Pinole Regional Shoreline north of Richmond, the Coyote Hills Regional Park near Fremont, the Martin Luther King Jr. Regional Shoreline on San Leandro Bay, and the Oyster Bay Regional Shoreline south of the Oakland International Airport.

The district also includes a former farm, a former coal mine, an extinct volcano, and one of the biggest dog-walking parks in the US. Redwood Regional Park contains the largest remaining natural stand of coast redwood in the East Bay.

==Planned expansions==
===Vargas Plateau Regional Park===
Around 1995, EBRPD acquired of the Vargas Plateau in Fremont, with of the Bay Area Ridge Trail and of other trails. Subsequently, park use was pushed back. As of 2007, the opening was expected by 2010. In 2010, EBRPD directors were expecting it would open soon. In 2011, EBRPD put the start in 2012. As of January 2015, EBRPD pointed to late 2015; while as of May 2015, the district pointed to spring 2016.

A 2012 settlement agreement between EBRPD and the owners of two large nearby ranches required the construction of improvements to park access roads. EBRPD and the city of Fremont agreed in 2013 to undertake them jointly, using $260,000 of funding by EBRPD and performed by the city. The park opened on May 5, 2016.

However, the park was closed by a court-issued preliminary injunction on July 13, 2016. The court found that the park district &quot;did not complete the improvements required by the settlement agreement prior to opening,&quot; which had &quot;very specific road widening requirements.&quot; The order applied to access by motor vehicles, as well as to access by non-motorized users for hiking, bicycling and horse riding, with immediate effect. &quot;The park could remain closed for months or years,&quot; until the improvements are completed.

On May 2, 2017, EBRPD announced that it had settled the lawsuit, and that the park would reopen on May 15, 2017. EBRPD said that it agreed to construct a paved shoulder along Vargas Road, and a vehicle turnaround on the upper part of Morrison Canyon Road. It also announced that the City of Fremont had agreed to contribute part of the necessary funds.

==Open space (land banks)==
One quarter of the District is designated as &quot;land banks,&quot; with no public access. The conversion of that open space to public use as regional parks has no fixed time line, and may span decades. Some parcels may never be converted.

===Doolan Canyon tracts===
Early in March 2019, EBRPD announced that it had finalized the purchase of in unincorporated Contra Costa County, from the Grove family. Funding of $1.24 million was provided by Measure WW. The parcel is about northwest of Livermore, and is bounded on the south by the proposed Doolan Canyon Regional Preserve. The other sides are bounded by private ranches and farmland. A park spokesman said that the parcel, &quot;... will protect the upper reaches of Doolan Canyon for &#x27;habitat protection, open space preservation, and potential recreational opportunities.&#x27;&quot; 

According to Sciacca&#x27;s article, EBRPD had already purchased adjacent to the Grove tract with funding from Altamont County (Altamont Landfill Open Space Landfill Fund, the City of Livermore, East Bay Community Foundation and Measure WW The price was $6.4 million.

EBRPD says that the Doolan Canyon area is habitat for the endangered species Alameda whip snake and red-legged frog. It also supports other &quot;special status&quot; species and some rare alkali soil plants.

The parcel will remain in land bank status until a land-use plan is written and approved. Making it into a park will require environmental assessments and community input, which could take many years, according to EBRPD. Meanwhile, EBRPD&#x27;s holdings are known as Doolan Canyon Regional Preserve

===Suncrest Homes/Antioch Holdings LLC property===
EBRPD acquired a hillside in Antioch, between Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve and Contra Loma Regional Park, and bought near Byron Vernon Pools Regional Preserve for $520,000. The 50-acre hillside, valued at $3.5 million, was donated to EBRPD by Suncrest Homes and Antioch Holdings LLC, a Suncrest land-holding subsidiary. The Byron tract is being purchased through the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservancy, a joint-powers authority created by the county, Brentwood. Oakley, Pittsburg and Next Era Energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Press_12/23/16&quot;&gt; Szymanski, Kyle. &quot;East Bay Regional Park District purchases more land in Antioch, Byron.&quot; &quot;Brentwood Press&quot;. December 23, 2016.] Accessed May 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hanson Hills property===
EBRPD announced in September 2016 that it had finalized the purchase of of ranch land east of Mount Diablo, near Antioch and Brentwood. The tract was identified only as the Hanson Hills property, which had previously been bought by the Save Mount Diablo conservation group. EBRPD reported that it had paid $730,000 for this property, which it intends to include in the Deer Valley Regional Park. The East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservancy contributed $547,000 to the purchase, and the remainder was supplied from the regional park Measure WW bonds approved by East Bay voters. Deer Valley Regional Park remains in Land Bank status and is closed to the public.

===Roddy Ranch parcel===
In 2013, EBRPD began acquiring Roddy Ranch a additional tract in east Contra Costa County. The new acquisition will create a nearly continuous offer zone of undeveloped land in eastern Contra Costa County from Black Diamond Mines Regional Park to Marsh Creek.

===Dainty Ranch parcel===
In 2013, EBRPD announced plans to acquire of grazing land southwest of the Roddy Ranch tract for $5 million. It will provide hiking and recreation services, and protect habitat for rare species such as the California red-legged frog. The combined Dainty and Roddy tracts will form the future Deer Valley Regional Park near Antioch and Brentwood.

James Ball Dainty, a rancher and coal miner, acquired Dainty Ranch in 1872.

===Mollar Ranch parcel===
Antioch Unified School District agreed to sell a 192-acre tract known as Mollar Ranch to EBRPD. The tract adjoins the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve on Somerville Road in Antioch, California. EBRPD plans to use the property to create a northern entrance to the preserve. The price agreed upon is $305,000. Funding is expected to come from the California Wildlife Protection Act and East Bay Regional Parks Measure WW funds.

===Wildcat Canyon addition===
EBRPD announced on February 17, 2014, that it had acquired of woodland on the east side of Wildcat Canyon Regional Park, which will be added to the existing park. The property is hilly with a mixture of laurels, oaks and native grasses. Fauna include mountain lions, coyotes, deer and hawks. The property had been owned by a developer who had intended to build 36 houses on it, before the recent collapse of real estate prices.

===Eddie&#x27;s Flat acquisition (Brushy Peak Regional Preserve)===
On April 3, 2014, two conservation groups, Center for Biological Diversity and the Alameda Creek Alliance, announced the acquisition of a land parcel known as &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Flat, adjacent to the western boundary of Brushy Peak Regional Preserve.

==Public safety and support organization==
The district maintains a police department and a fire department.

A volunteer organization that supports the work of EBRPD, the Regional Parks Foundation raises funds for the improvement of the parks. The EBRPD is a member of the Bay Area Open Space Council.

<text>The Symphony No. 6 in F major, Op. 68, also known as the Pastoral Symphony (German: &quot;Pastorale&quot;), is a symphony composed by Ludwig van Beethoven and completed in 1808. One of Beethoven&#x27;s few works containing explicitly programmatic content, the symphony was first performed alongside his fifth symphony in the Theater an der Wien on 22 December 1808 in a four-hour concert.

== Background ==
Beethoven was a lover of nature who spent a great deal of his time on walks in the country. He frequently left Vienna to work in rural locations. He said that the Sixth Symphony is &quot;more the expression of feeling than painting&quot;, a point underlined by the title of the first movement.

The first sketches of the &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; appeared in 1802. It was composed simultaneously with Beethoven&#x27;s more famous Fifth Symphony. Both symphonies were premiered in a long and under-rehearsed concert in the Theater at der Wien in Vienna on 22 December 1808.

Frank A. D&#x27;Accone suggested that Beethoven borrowed the programmatic ideas (a shepherd&#x27;s pipe, birds singing, streams flowing, and a thunderstorm) for his five-movement narrative layout from &quot;Le Portrait musical de la Nature ou Grande Symphonie&quot;, which was composed by Justin Heinrich Knecht (1752–1817) in 1784.

== Instrumentation ==
The symphony is scored for the following instrumentation:

Woodwinds
:1 piccolo (fourth movement only)
:2 flutes
:2 oboes
:2 clarinets in B
:2 bassoons

Brass
:2 horns in F and B
:2 trumpets in C and E (third, fourth, and fifth movements only)
:2 trombones (alto and tenor, fourth and fifth movements only)

Percussion
:Timpani in F and C (fourth movement only)

Strings
:Violins I, II
:Violas
:Cellos
:Double basses
== Form ==
The symphony has five, rather than the four movements typical of symphonies preceding Beethoven&#x27;s time, although there are no pauses between the last three movements. Beethoven wrote a programmatic title at the beginning of each movement:
The third movement ends on an unresolved cadence that leads straight into the fourth. A performance of the work lasts about 35-46 minutes, depending on the choice of tempo and whether the repeats in the 1st and 3rd movements are omitted.

=== I. Allegro ma non troppo ===

The symphony begins with a placid and cheerful movement depicting the composer&#x27;s feelings as he arrives in the country. The movement, in meter, is in sonata form, and its motifs are extensively developed. At several points, Beethoven builds up orchestral texture by multiple repetitions of very short motifs. Yvonne Frindle commented that &quot;the infinite repetition of pattern in nature [is] conveyed through rhythmic cells, its immensity through sustained pure harmonies.&quot;

=== II. Andante molto mosso ===

The second movement is another sonata-form movement, this time in and in the key of B major, the subdominant of the main key of the work. It begins with the strings playing a motif that imitates flowing water. The cello section is divided, with just two players playing the flowing-water notes on muted instruments, and the remaining cellos playing mostly pizzicato notes together with the double basses.

Towards the end is a cadenza for woodwind instruments that imitates bird calls. Beethoven helpfully identified the bird species in the score: nightingale (flute), quail (oboe), and cuckoo (two clarinets).

=== III. Allegro ===

The third movement is a scherzo in time, which depicts country folk dancing and reveling. It is in F major, returning to the main key of the symphony. The movement is an altered version of the usual form for scherzi, in that the trio appears twice rather than just once, and the third appearance of the scherzo theme is truncated. Perhaps to accommodate this rather spacious arrangement, Beethoven did not mark the usual internal repeats of the scherzo and the trio. Theodor Adorno identifies this scherzo as the model for the scherzos by Anton Bruckner.

The final return of the theme conveys a riotous atmosphere with a faster tempo. The movement ends abruptly, leading without a pause into the fourth movement.

=== IV. Allegro ===

The fourth movement, in F minor and time, is the part where Beethoven calls for the largest instrumentation in the entire piece. It depicts a violent thunderstorm with painstaking realism, building from distant thunder (quiet tremolos on cellos and basses) and a few drops of rain (eighth-note passages on the violins) to a great climax with loud thunder (timpani), lightning (piccolo), high winds (swirling arpeggio-like passages on the strings), and heavy downpours of rain (16-note tremolo passages on the strings). With the addition of the trombones later in the movement, Beethoven makes an even more tremendous effect. The storm eventually passes, with an occasional peal of thunder still heard in the distance. An ascending scale passage on the solo flute represents a rainbow. There is a seamless transition into the final movement. This movement parallels Mozart&#x27;s procedure in his String Quintet in G minor K. 516 of 1787, which likewise prefaces a serene final movement with a long, emotionally stormy introduction.

=== V. Allegretto ===
The finale, which is in F major, is in time. The movement is in sonata rondo form, in an Intro-[A-B-A]-C-[A-B-A]-Coda structure. Like many finales, this movement emphasizes a symmetrical eight-bar theme, in this case representing the shepherds&#x27; song of thanksgiving.

The final A section starts quietly and gradually builds to an ecstatic culmination for the full orchestra (minus piccolo and timpani) with the first violins playing very rapid triplet tremolo on a high F. There follows a fervent coda suggestive of prayer, marked by Beethoven &quot;pianissimo&quot;, &quot;sotto voce&quot;; most conductors slow the tempo for this passage. After a brief period of afterglow, the work ends with two emphatic F-major chords.

== In popular culture ==
* The symphony was used in the 1940 Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, albeit with mythology and alterations in the length of the piece made by conductor Leopold Stokowski.
* The beginning of the first movement is used in the &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The music underscores idealized scenes of children playing outside. The same excerpt would later be used again in the closing scene of the episode &quot;Wild Barts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot;, this time underscoring Springfield&#x27;s elderly population having fun outside.
* The opening measures of the first movement were one of three pieces played over CBS Radio upon the first announcement of the death of American President John F. Kennedy by Allan Jackson and Dallas Townsend. 
* The first movement was used in the 1973 science fiction film &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (uncredited).
* The first movement was also used in the beginning ice skating scene of 2005 Barbie fantasy movie &quot;Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus&quot;.
* The fifth movement was used in the 1975 Chuck Jones&#x27; television film, &quot;The White Seal&quot;.
* The fifth movement was also used in the Baby Einstein video, &quot;Baby Galileo&quot;.
*This Symphony is referenced in William Styron&#x27;s novel &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Sophie and Nathan listen to a rendition of this musical piece by the Philadelphia Orchestra on the radio in her room shortly after their first meeting, when she fainted in the library and he came to her rescue. She is reduced to tears on listening to it, and confides to Nathan that it was the last piece of music that she heard (illegally on a British radio station) before being sent to the concentration camps.

The name of the operating system, many of its associated programs, and that of the current company, were inspired by Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. In Italian, &quot;Inferno&quot; means &quot;hell&quot;, of which there are nine circles in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

== Design principles ==
Inferno was created in 1995 by members of Bell Labs&#x27; Computer Science Research division to bring ideas derived from their previous operating system, Plan 9 from Bell Labs, to a wider range of devices and networks. Inferno is a distributed operating system based on three basic principles:

* Resources as files: all resources are represented as files within a hierarchical file system
* Namespaces: a program&#x27;s view of the network is a single, coherent namespace that appears as a hierarchical file system but may represent physically separated (locally or remotely) resources
* Standard communication protocol: a standard protocol, called Styx, is used to access all resources, both local and remote

To handle the diversity of network environments it was intended to be used in, the designers decided a virtual machine (VM) was a necessary component of the system. This is the same conclusion of the Oak project that became Java, but arrived at independently. The Dis virtual machine is a register machine intended to closely match the architecture it runs on, in contrast to the stack machine of the Java virtual machine. An advantage of this approach is the relative simplicity of creating a just-in-time compiler for new architectures.

The virtual machine provides memory management designed to be efficient on devices with as little as 1 MiB of memory and without memory-mapping hardware. Its garbage collector is a hybrid of reference counting and a real-time coloring collector that gathers cyclic data.

The Inferno kernel contains the virtual machine, on-the-fly compiler, scheduler, devices, protocol stacks, and the name space evaluator for each process&#x27; file name space, and the root of the file system hierarchy. The kernel also includes some built-in modules that provide interfaces of the virtual operating system, such as system calls, graphics, security, and math modules.

The Bell Labs Technical Journal paper introducing Inferno listed several dimensions of portability and versatility provided by the OS:

* Portability across processors: it currently runs on ARM, SGI MIPS, HP PA-RISC, IBM PowerPC, Sun SPARC, and Intel x86 architectures and is readily portable to others.
* Portability across environments: it runs as a stand-alone operating system on small terminals, and also as a user application under Bell Plan 9, MS Windows NT, Windows 95, and Unix (SGI Irix, Sun Solaris, FreeBSD, Apple Mac OS X, Linux, IBM AIX, HP-UX, Digital Tru64). In all of these environments, Inferno programs see an identical interface.
* Distributed design: the identical environment is established at the user&#x27;s terminal and at the server, and each may import the resources (for example, the attached I/O devices or networks) of the other. Aided by the communications facilities of the run-time system, programs may be split easily (and even dynamically) between client and server.
* Minimal hardware requirements: it runs useful applications stand-alone on machines with as little as 1 MiB of memory, and does not require memory-mapping hardware.
* Portable programs: Inferno programs are written in the type-safe language Limbo and compiled to Dis bytecode, which can be run without modifications on all Inferno platforms.
* Dynamic adaptability: programs may, depending on the hardware or other resources available, load different program modules to perform a specific function. For example, a video player might use any of several different decoder modules.

These design choices were directed to provide standard interfaces that free content and service providers from concern of the details of diverse hardware, software, and networks over which their content is delivered.

== Features ==
Inferno programs are portable across a broad mix of hardware, networks, and environments. It defines a virtual machine, known as Dis, that can be implemented on any real machine, provides Limbo, a type-safe language that is compiled to portable byte code, and, more significantly, it includes a virtual operating system that supplies the same interfaces whether Inferno
runs natively on hardware or runs as a user program on top of another operating system.

A communications protocol called Styx is applied uniformly to access both local and remote resources, which programs use by calling standard file operations, open, read, write, and close. As of the fourth edition of Inferno, Styx is identical to Plan 9&#x27;s newer version of its hallmark 9P protocol, 9P2000.

Most of the Inferno commands are very similar to Unix commands with the same name.

== History ==
Inferno is a descendant of Plan 9 from Bell Labs, and shares many design concepts and even source code in the kernel, particularly around devices and the Styx/9P2000 protocol.
Inferno shares with Plan 9 the Unix heritage from Bell Labs and the Unix philosophy. Many of the command line tools in Inferno were Plan 9 tools that were translated to Limbo.

In the mid-1990s, Plan 9 development was set aside in favor of Inferno.
The new system&#x27;s existence was leaked by Dennis Ritchie in early 1996, after less than a year of development on the system, and publicly presented later that year as a competitor to Java. At the same time, Bell Labs&#x27; parent company AT&amp;T licensed Java technology from Sun Microsystems.

In March–April 1997 IEEE Internet Computing included an advertisement for Inferno networking software. It claimed that various devices could communicate over &quot;any network&quot; including the Internet, telecommunications and LANs. The advertisement stated that video games could talk to computers,–a PlayStation was pictured–cell phones could access email and voice mail was available via TV.

Lucent used Inferno in at least two internal products: the Lucent VPN Firewall Brick, and the Lucent Pathstar phone switch. They initially tried to sell source code licenses of Inferno but found few buyers. Lucent did little marketing and missed the importance of the Internet and Inferno&#x27;s relation to it. During the same time Sun Microsystems was heavily marketing its own Java programming language, which was targeting a similar market, with analogous technology, that worked in web browsers and also filled the demand for object-oriented languages popular at that time. Lucent licensed Java from Sun, claiming that all Inferno devices would be made to run Java. A Java byte code to Dis byte code translator was written to facilitate that. However, Inferno still did not find customers.

The Inferno Business Unit closed after three years, and was sold to Vita Nuova Holdings. Vita Nuova continued development and offered commercial licenses to the complete system, and free downloads and licenses (not GPL compatible) for all of the system except the kernel and VM. They ported the software to new hardware and focused on distributed applications. Eventually, Vita Nuova released the 4th edition under more common free software licenses, and in 2021 they relicensed all editions under mainly the MIT License.

== Ports ==
Inferno runs on native hardware directly and also as an application providing a virtual operating system which runs on other platforms. Programs can be developed and run on all Inferno platforms without modifying or recompiling.

Native ports include these architectures: x86, MIPS, ARM, PowerPC, SPARC.

Hosted or virtual OS ports include: Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Plan 9, Mac OS X, Solaris, IRIX, UnixWare.

Inferno can also be hosted by a plugin to Internet Explorer. Vita Nuova said that plugins for other browsers were under development, but they were never released.

Inferno has also been ported to Openmoko, Nintendo DS, SheevaPlug, and Android.

== Distribution ==
Inferno 4th edition was released in early 2005 as free software. Specifically, it was dual-licensed under two structures. Users could either obtain it under a set of free software licenses, or they could obtain it under a proprietary license. In the case of the free software license scheme, different parts of the system were covered by different licenses, including the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, the Lucent Public License, and the MIT License, excluding the fonts, which are sub-licensed from Bigelow and Holmes.

In March 2021, all editions were relicensed under mainly the MIT License.

<doc id="507929" wikidata="Q4040445" url="?curid=507929" title="Inferno (Niven and Pournelle novel)">
<text>Inferno is a fantasy novel written by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle and published in 1976. It was nominated for the 1976 Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel.

==Background==
The book drew inspiration from the geography of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; and the theology of C S Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;, which is that salvation and entry into paradise, via self-knowledge and repentance, can be achieved by all. However, most of Hell&#x27;s denizens in the novel either deny their sins or feel they deserve their fate.

==Plot summary==

&quot;Inferno&quot; is based upon the hell described in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. However, it adds a modern twist to the story. The story is told in the first person by Allen Carpenter (who spelled his name &quot;Carpentier&quot; on his novels), an agnostic science fiction writer who died in a failed attempt to entertain his fans at a science fiction convention party. He finds himself in a Djinn-bottle in the Vestibule on the outer edge to Hell; he spends a vast amount of time there, but is released when he finally calls upon God for mercy. Allen is met by Benito, a Virgil-like figure whose full identity is not immediately apparent. Benito offers to take Allen out of Hell by bringing him to the center.

At first, as Allen and Benito travel through Hell, Allen tries to scientifically rationalize everything he sees, renaming his surroundings as &#x27;Infernoland&#x27;, a high-tech amusement park some thousand years in the future. It isn&#x27;t until he sees a man recover from incineration and his own leg heal from a compound fracture that he starts to actually believe that he is in Hell. From this point on, as Allen travels through the inner circles of Hell, he sees how he is guilty of each of the sins in some fashion, commenting to himself that he is in no danger from ditch 3 of circle 8 (simony) only because he has never had any holy offices to sell. At first Allen views the punishments for these sins as far surpassing the crime, repeatedly thinking, &quot;We&#x27;re in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism&quot;, although he comes more and more to accept the justice of the situation as he realizes that it is their continuing denial of their sins that keeps many of the condemned in hell. Eventually Allen takes over Benito&#x27;s role in helping reformed souls proceed on to Paradise via Purgatory, allowing Benito to move on towards Purgatory himself. It is revealed that Benito is actually Benito Mussolini, the former dictator of Italy.

Along the way Allen meets a number of his Californian acquaintances and notable people from history (e.g. Epictetus, Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Bob Ford, L Ron Hubbard, Henry VIII of England, Vlad Tepes, Aimee Semple McPherson, William M. Tweed, Al Capone) and from classical mythology (e.g. Hector, Aeneas, Charon, Minos, Phlegyas, Geryon). Due to the long time he spent bottled up in the outer vestibule he also meets some people from the future of 1976, such as a Space Shuttle pilot.

==Reception==
The authors said that &quot;Inferno&quot; was far more successful than they predicted, and they were told that it inspired a resurgence of interest in Dante amongst college students and a new print release of John Ciardi&#x27;s translation (whose quotes appear in the novel). Pournelle reported in January 1984 that he and Niven planned to write the script for a text adventure based on the novel.

==Sequel==
The sequel to Inferno, &quot;Escape from Hell&quot;, was released in February 2009. Its working title was &quot;Dante meets Vatican II&quot;.

<text>Big Bear, also known as  (; – 17 January 1888), was a powerful and popular Cree chief who played many pivotal roles in Canadian history. He was appointed to chief of his band at the age of 40 upon the death of his father, Black Powder, under his father&#x27;s harmonious and inclusive rule which directly impacted his own leadership. Big Bear is most notable for his involvement in Treaty 6 and the 1885 North-West Rebellion; he was one of the few chief leaders who objected to the signing of the treaty with the Canadian government. He felt that signing the treaty would ultimately have devastating effects on his nation as well as other Indigenous nations. This included losing the free nomadic lifestyle that his nation and others were accustomed to. Big Bear also took part in one of the last major battles between the Cree and the Blackfoot nations, leading fighters in the last, largest battle on the Canadian Plains.

==Early life==

Big Bear (, in syllabics) was born in 1824 in Jackfish Lake, near the future site of Battleford. His father, Muckitoo (otherwise known as Black Powder), was a minor chief of a tribe of 80 Plains Cree-Saulteaux people who were deemed to be &quot;true nomadic hunters&quot;. Little is known about Big Bear&#x27;s mother. When Big Bear was old enough to walk on his own he spent his time wandering the camp socializing with many people, from the women to council members. In the spring of 1837, smallpox struck Big Bear&#x27;s community and caused the quick departure of the Cree from the plains. Big Bear was infected with the virus but unlike many in the community, after two months of suffering, he overcame it, although it did leave his face partially disfigured. After his recovery from smallpox, Big Bear began to spend a great deal of time with his father, including a journey by the two of them to Bull&#x27;s Forehead Hill, where they spent a great deal of time reflecting and offering to their gods and spirits.

Upon reflection, Big Bear was visited by many spirits, but the bear took great prominence in his mind. As a result of his vision of the Bear Spirit, which is the most powerful spirit regarded by the Crees, he received his power bundle, song, and his name. The power bundle, which was never opened unless to be worn in war or dance, contained a fur necklace in the shape of a bear paw. It is said that when the weight of the necklace rested against his soul, it enabled him to be in a perfect power position where nothing could hurt him. This necklace was the source of his nickname , meaning bear, and , meaning much, or big.

It is reported that throughout Big Bear&#x27;s life, he had several wives, producing at least four male children who would carry on his name, including his son Âyimisîs (Little Bad Man/Little Bear), who helped found the Montana First Nation reserve in Alberta and the Rocky Boy Reservation in Montana. There is little documentation to support the names of most of his sons.

==Leadership==
Before becoming a great leader, Big Bear became a great warrior, taking warriors under his father&#x27;s command on missions that he described as &quot;haunting the Blackfoot&quot;. Upon the death of his father Black Powder in the winter of 1864, his Band with over 100 members needed a chief. Big Bear was 40 years old and was the obvious choice. He would be the next chief.

Big Bear was described as &quot;an independent spirit&quot; who did not like taking direction from outsiders.&quot; He was chosen and followed by the Plains Cree because of his traditional manner and wisdom.

Traditional activities, such as hunting and warfare, kept Big Bear and his band occupied until the 1870s brought police, treaties, and the end of the buffalo.

At the height of his influence in the winter of 1878 to 1879, the buffalo that the plains peoples hunted for food did not come north.

==Historical context==
The Western Plains Indigenous People underwent a cultural, environmental and structural change starting in the mid-1870s and continuing into the late 1800s. Canada was attempting to cultivate the land that the Indigenous population occupied for European settlers. The treaties were the method of choice by the government to gain rights to the ground; all Indigenous groups were given the opportunity, according to the government, to sign and receive the benefits of the treaty terms. However, the Indigenous People who did not want to sign were ultimately forced to sign because of environmental and cultural changes between 1870 and 1885. The most significant contributing factor to this was the disappearance of the bison which created a region-wide famine; in addition to this, there was the emergence and widespread epidemic of tuberculosis which had a devastating effect on the Indigenous population. The disappearance of the bison has been explained to some extent by the overhunting by white settlers to supply the fur trade which ultimately led to the famine. There were some attempts by the Canadian government to conserve the bison but the measures were not enacted in time to stop the drastic depletion of the bison food supply.

In the early 1880s, tuberculosis became the main killer of the Indigenous people on the reserve as European settlers brought over the disease and spread it through coughing and the sharing of pipes during tobacco-smoking ceremonies. The disappearance of the bison was devastating to the Indigenous population because hunting allowed them to be self-sufficient and free from the dominion government; once the bison disappeared their need for assistance was imperative. The Canadian government was the only option of survival but this meant signing the numbered treaties which would change their culture indefinitely. During this time, Big Bear tried to withhold his signature from the treaty so that his people might get better terms but by the mid-1880s malnutrition was severe and the meagre rations given by the dominion government did not supply enough food. Big Bear was ultimately forced to sign the treaty on 8 December 1882 to save his people from starvation and disease because the dominion government would not help unless they signed. These factors contributed to the many deaths of Indigenous leaders leaving tribes without their history, which was taught by the elderly, and without men to lead their tribes changing their life from that point on.

==Conflict with other Indigenous People ==


To be a Scrub Plains Cree Indigenous man it was an expectation to be an accomplished hunter and warrior, Big Bear was no exception to the rule. Big Bear was known to be a strong warrior and was often, as an adult, called upon to defend the community. A Cree man, to raise his position in the community, participated in raids and or attacks of enemy tribes which meant stealing of horses, land and food from their enemies. Big Bear&#x27;s main responsibility was to be a hunter and provide for his family but he was involved in attacks against the enemies of the Cree.

The Battle of the Belly River was one of the largest battles that the Cree were involved in. Occurring in October 1870, Big Bear and his band were involved in an attack between the Plains Cree and their enemies, the Blackfoot tribe, at Belly River, which is near present-day Lethbridge, Alberta. Known to be the largest Indian battle to be fought on the Canadian Plains, the Blackfoot band only lost 40 warriors while the Cree lost between 200 and 300. This was the last battle to be fought between the First Nations. The decades following this battle brought an increased White settlement, as well as police and government presence and the disappearance of the buffalo.

==Treaty 6==
As the 1870s began, Big Bear and his tribe had reached the high point of development for their band. It started to become more and more apparent that these conditions would not remain forever. Disease had begun to ravage his people and the declining numbers of buffalo threatened their food source and economy. This was quite worrisome for Big Bear as both a father and a chief, and he knew something had to be done. On 14 August 1874, The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company visited Big Bear and his fellow Cree people. This was seen as peculiar to Big Bear and his people as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company would have had to travel seven days from the nearest trading post to visit their camp. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company arrived with four wagons full of supplies. Factor William McKay (an old friend of Big Bear) came along for the trip, and he warned Big Bear of the establishment of the North-West Mounted Police in the area. McKay told Big Bear that the North-West Mounted Police were to preserve the west as Canadian and how they were not to interfere with but to protect aboriginal interests. At the end of the visit, McKay and the HBC distributed gifts to the 65 tents of Big Bear&#x27;s people; however, some were reluctant, they viewed the gifts and the North-West Mounted Police as a means of appeasement and incentive to start the treaty process with Canada.

Big Bear began talks with the Canadian government in the 1870s to work out a treaty. Big Bear was never open to the idea of reserve life, as he feared his loss of freedom and identity as a hunter. But he knew that best way for him and his band to avoid starvation was to sign a treaty with the Canadian government. By 1876, all major Plains Cree chiefs had signed Treaty 6 except for Big Bear. Big Bear stalled signing as he believed that the Canadian government would violate the treaty. Big Bear said &quot;we want none of the Queen&#x27;s presents: When we set a fox trap we scatter pieces of meat all around but when the fox gets into the trap we knock him on the head. We want no baits. Let your chiefs come like men and talk to us.&quot; Big Bear believed that the Canadian government was telling him and his fellow chiefs what they wanted to hear. This led Big Bear to resist signing and to pursue better terms for Treaty 6.

Big Bear made several attempts to warn the others against signing Treaty 6. At one point Big Bear rode by horseback to each lodge in the area urging people not to sign the treaty and not to give up the land, because it was so rich in natural resources. Big Bear also resisted publicly at both Fort Carleton and Pitt, where the treaty was being signed. Big Bear understood the importance of making the best of this treaty as it would have implications on the generations to come. Big Bear also questioned the Eurocentric worldview and new order being brought forth with these treaties.

Others tried to discredit Big Bear in his attempt to change Treaty 6. John McDougall tried on several occasions to discount him. He claimed Big Bear was an outsider, that he was not of the area and did not deserve the esteem he carried among the people of this area. This was not true, as he was a Cree but also his father was Saulteaux (the other aboriginal group present in the signing of Treaty 6). He was not an outsider but rather leader of a group of people who had elements of both cultures.
Big Bear resisted signing but signed Treaty 6 in 1882. He did so because he believed he had no other choice. Big Bear believed he was betrayed by the other chiefs as they signed the treaty after all his warnings.

==North-West Rebellion==
The North-West Rebellion was a five-month revolt in 1885 against the Canadian government that was mainly fought by the Métis and their First Nations allies due to rising fear, insecurity, and a wave of white settlers causing rapid changes on the Prairie West. The results of the suppression of the rebellion were the enforcement of Canadian law, the subjugation of the Plains Indigenous Peoples, and the conviction and execution of Louis Riel.

Big Bear&#x27;s involvement in the North-West Rebellion was seen in his advocacy for a better deal with the Canadian government in terms of Treaty 6. By the late 1870s, the Plains Indigenous nations were facing starvation due to the disappearing bison herds. In 1880, Big Bear and Crowfoot founded a confederacy in order to solve their people&#x27;s grievances. In 1885, the Canadian government cut off rations to force Big Bear to settle, as he was still resisting against moving his people onto a reserve.

Led by Big Bear&#x27;s son Little Bad Man (AKA Little Bear) and Chief Wandering Spirit, a group of Big Bear&#x27;s Cree camping near Frog Lake took matters into their own hands after receiving news that the Métis had defeated a North-West Mounted Police force at Duck Lake on 26 March 1885. On 1 April 1885, several Métis and non-Métis settlers were taken as prisoners. The following day, Wandering Spirit killed federal agent Thomas Trueman Quinn, who had denied his people food rations. Although Big Bear tried to stop the violence, the Cree fighters killed nine more men. This became known as the Frog Lake Massacre. Once news spread of this incident, the Canadian government decided to hold Big Bear responsible as an active participant in the massacre and the Metis rebellion, even though at that point he had not personally participated and had no control over some members of his band.

==Life after Treaty 6 and the Trial of Big Bear==
Big Bear had resisted signing Treaty 6 for four years. With food supplies running low and his people facing starvation, he was forced to sign the Treaty. After signing the Treaty, Big Bear and his people could not decide where their reserve would be. Though they did not want to live on a reserve, in order to receive food rations from the government a location needed to be decided on. The first winter after signing the treaty, Big Bear and his people did not receive any rations as they had not decided what reserve to live on. In the year 1884, Big Bear met Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company clerk Henry Ross Halpin in Frog Lake, and the pair soon became friends. In 1885 Big Bear chose a reserve to live on. 

As Big Bear delayed making the choice of a reserve, he lost influence over his people. Cree Chief Wandering Spirit rose in authority among the band. After Métis initiated the North-West Rebellion of 1885 under Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont, Big Bear and his band played a minimal role in the overall uprising. Big Bear&#x27;s son Little Bear joined with Chief Wandering Spirit to go to Frog Lake and kill some of the white residents. 

Big Bear voluntarily surrendered to the North-West Mounted Police at Fort Carlton on 2 July 1885.

Big Bear tried to solve the problems between his people and the Canadian government peacefully. Many hoped Big Bear would be found &#x27;not guilty&#x27; as he had tried to stop the massacre at Frog Lake and had tried to protect the white hostages that were taken prisoner. 

His friend, Henry Ross Halpin, testified at his trial saying that he was just as much of a prisoner as he himself had been. At the time of the trial, Big Bear was 60 years old. The trial was confusing for Big Bear as the trial was in English, and had to be translated into Cree. Hugh Dempsey stated in his book that Stanley Simpson, a man who was taken prisoner at Fort Pitt, was the only man to appear for the prosecution. Much of the evidence supported Big Bear&#x27;s innocence. The evidence was clear that Big Bear had not taken part in killings at Frog Lake or the looting and taking of hostages at Fort Pitt. 

However, judge Hugh Richardson found Big Bear guilty of treason-felony. He was sentenced to three years at Stony Mountain Penitentiary in Manitoba.

==Death==
While imprisoned, Big Bear converted to Christianity. He became ill and was eventually released in February 1887 after serving approximately half of his prison term. He went to live on the Little Pine reserve. His failing health resulted in his death soon after, on January 17, 1888, at 62 years of age.

==Legacy==
Big Bear&#x27;s legacy continues to be prominent Long after his death. To many, he is honoured as a powerful Cree Chief who advocated for Indigenous rights and fought against socio-economic injustices that the Canadian government brought upon his people. He was chosen and followed by his followers because of his wisdom. This can be seen in the fact that he resisted whites with ideas, not guns or any sort of violence.

It has been argued that Big Bear should be commemorated as part of Canada&#x27;s ongoing reconciliation process between whites and Indigenous people, as he deserves public recognition for what he sacrificed and stood up for during his time as chief.

Some say there is need for Big Bear, Poundmaker, One Arrow and other chiefs who were convicted for the crime of treason-felony to be exonerated. Some have stated that these convictions were false, as “the government of the day was looking for an excuse to silence First Nations leaders who were pressing for the treaties to be honoured.”

<doc id="507931" wikidata="Q1543686" url="?curid=507931" title="The Divine Comedy (band)">
<text>The Divine Comedy are a pop band from Northern Ireland, formed in 1989 and fronted by Neil Hannon. Hannon has been the only constant member of the group, playing, in some instances, all of the non-orchestral instrumentation except drums. The band has released 12 studio albums. Between 1996 and 1999, nine singles released by the band made the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, including the 1999 top ten hit &quot;National Express&quot;.

== History ==
===The beginning and early success (&quot;Fanfare&quot; to &quot;Promenade&quot;)===
The Divine Comedy were founded in 1989, by Neil Hannon who had been the only member of the band until he was joined by John McCullagh and Kevin Traynor. Their first album, &quot;Fanfare for the Comic Muse&quot;, enjoyed a minor success and was later deleted. A couple of equally unsuccessful EPs – &quot;Timewatch&quot; (1991) and &quot;Europop&quot; (1992) – followed, with newly recruited member John Allen handling lead vocals on some tracks. After the commercial failure of the &quot;Europop&quot; EP, this line-up soon fell apart.

Hannon, however, was not deterred in his efforts and entered the studio again in March 1993, teaming up with co-producer/drummer Darren Allison, for the recording of &quot;Liberation&quot;. The record is characterised by a plethora of literary references: &quot;Bernice Bobs Her Hair&quot; recalls a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald; &quot;Three Sisters&quot; draws upon the play by Anton Chekhov; and &quot;Lucy&quot; is essentially three William Wordsworth poems abridged to music.

Minor success in France enabled Hannon to proceed with his second effort, &quot;Promenade&quot;, released in 1994. It was heavily driven by classical influences, with Michael Nyman&#x27;s stylings clearly an inspiration. Hannon himself acknowledged this when he reportedly sent a copy of his new album to the composer, jokingly asking him not to sue. Essentially a concept album about a day spent by two lovers, it also received similar positive feedback to &quot;Liberation&quot;; however, it was not a major commercial success. Soon after the release of the album, the Divine Comedy went on tour with Tori Amos, supporting her during her European dates.

During that time, Hannon also wrote and performed (with drummer Allison) the theme music for the sitcom &quot;Father Ted,&quot; he also composed the music for the mock-Eurovision song &quot;My Lovely Horse&quot; that featured in one episode. Hannon resisted widespread requests from fans to release the track as a single for the Christmas market, but it was eventually released in 1999 as the third track on the CD-single &quot;Gin Soaked Boy&quot;. This would not be the only time they would be responsible for a TV theme: &quot;In Pursuit of Happiness&quot; was used by the BBC science and technology show &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World.&quot; Hannon also composed the music for Father Ted co-writer Graham Linehan&#x27;s Channel 4 comedy series &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;.

===The road to fame (&quot;Casanova&quot; to &quot;A Secret History...&quot;)===
The album &quot;Casanova&quot; (1996), and in particular the single &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot;, championed by Chris Evans, then BBC Radio 1 breakfast show DJ and presenter of &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, led to the band&#x27;s first major success. &quot;Casanova&quot; was the third album to be produced by Darren Allison and Neil Hannon, thus completing a trilogy of albums which began with &quot;Liberation&quot; in 1993. Further singles from &quot;Casanova&quot;, including &quot;Becoming More Like Alfie&quot; and &quot;The Frog Princess&quot;, both of which received some airplay, further cemented the band&#x27;s reputation.

At the height of their commercial success, the band released &quot;A Short Album About Love&quot; (a reference to the Krzysztof Kieślowski film &quot;A Short Film About Love&quot;), recorded live at soundcheck with the Brunel Ensemble in preparation for a concert at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, from which several songs were released as B-sides. It was aptly released on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1997. Subsequently, the band contributed a reworking of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to a Marvellous Party&quot; to &quot;Twentieth-Century Blues: The Songs of Noël Coward&quot;, a compilation of covers of the writer&#x27;s songs, with Hannon affecting a Cowardesque lilt (albeit interspersed with an aggressive electronic musical backing).

The foppish image, but not the suit, was ditched for the more sombre album &quot;Fin De Siècle&quot; in 1998, although its biggest hit, the jaunty &quot;National Express&quot;, belied its more intimate, soul-searching tone. Maintaining the balance between these poles, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Secret History – the Best of The Divine Comedy&quot; included re-recordings of &quot;Liberation&quot; tracks (&quot;The Pop Singer&#x27;s Fear of the Pollen Count&quot; and &quot;Your Daddy&#x27;s Car&quot;) and two new songs (&quot;Gin-Soaked Boy&quot; and &quot;Too Young to Die&quot;) alongside the band&#x27;s main hits. In the same year, the band also collaborated with Tom Jones on a cover version of Portishead&#x27;s &#x27;All Mine&#x27;, featured on his album Reload.

A serious side to the band was also in evidence in 2000&#x27;s collaboration with Ute Lemper on her album &quot;Punishing Kiss&quot;, most of which featured The Divine Comedy as Lemper&#x27;s backing band. Neil Hannon and Joby Talbot also contributed two original songs and an arrangement of Brecht and Weill&#x27;s &quot;Tango Ballad&quot;, whilst Neil Hannon sang two songs (&quot;Tango Ballad&quot;, &quot;Split&quot;) as duets with Lemper.

===Post-Setanta (&quot;Regeneration&quot; &quot;to Office Politics&quot;)===

The band performed at V2001 Festival, and their 2001 album &quot;Regeneration&quot; attempted to remove the band still further from its association with comedy. Hannon hired producer Nigel Godrich to &quot;remake&quot; the band. Hannon ditched the suit and donned a Britrock band image. The album was a greater critical than commercial success, and soon after its release it was announced that the Divine Comedy were splitting up. However, within a year Hannon was touring again with a revised band line-up, playing a series of joint-headline gigs in the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland featuring both the Divine Comedy and Ben Folds.

A new album surfaced in the form of 2004&#x27;s &quot;Absent Friends&quot;. The album struck a balance between the occasionally earnest sound of the band&#x27;s later material and the lighter tone of the more popular releases. 2004 saw two performances featuring The Millennia Ensemble orchestra, one at the London Palladium (which was later released as a live DVD) and one at the Royal Albert Hall. In January 2005, Hannon announced that he had acquired the worldwide copyrights to all of his recorded output with his former record label, Setanta Records. He launched his own record label Divine Comedy Records in order to re-release his 1990s output.

Hannon&#x27;s ninth album with the Divine Comedy, &quot;Victory for the Comic Muse&quot;, was released in June 2006. The bulk of the record was recorded over two weeks, much of it live rather than multi-tracked, hence a more spontaneous sound. The album featured Simon Little on bass, Andrew Skeet on keys, Tim Weller on drums and Ian Watson on accordion from the current band.

Hannon also provided vocals for songs on the soundtrack for the film of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; released in 2005, working with Joby Talbot, the composer for the film and former Divine Comedy band member. This sci-fi connection continued in late 2006, when he contributed vocals to two tracks – &quot;Song For Ten&quot; and &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Roam&quot; – on the &quot;Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack&quot; album. In an interview with Bullz-Eye.com, Hannon explained that, &quot;literally, I was asked to add my vocal by the composer of the songs, who writes for the show. And I didn’t feel that I could say no, simply because I spent my childhood watching this programme. It would be just plain wrong to not do it.&quot; Hannon also lent his vocals to &quot;Aliens&quot;, the last track on the Irish charity album &quot;The Cake Sale&quot; in 2006, organised by Brian Crosby of Bell X1 and featuring a variety of mainly Irish musicians.

In 2007, the first ten or so seconds of &quot;Tonight We Fly&quot; was used as the ending tune to BBC7&#x27;s &quot;Digi Radio&quot;. The song was also used for an advertisement for the Airbus A340 airliner.

Meanwhile, Hannon took part in various projects: he recorded &quot;Perfection As a Hipster&quot;, included in the &quot;God Help the Girl&quot; soundtrack, a soon-to-be-released musical film by Belle and Sebastian frontman Stuart Murdoch as well as the LP &quot;The Duckworth Lewis Method&quot;, together with Thomas Walsh of Pugwash. In March 2007 Neil Hannon&#x27;s relationship with Parlophone came to an end.

On 31 May 2010, The Divine Comedy released their tenth album entitled &quot;Bang Goes the Knighthood&quot; on DC Records. As with &quot;Victory for the Comic Muse&quot; it was recorded in RAK studios in St John&#x27;s Wood by Guy Massey and the orchestra was conducted by Andrew Skeet who was the arranger on this album. The album charted at 20 in the first week of release, making it their highest-charting album since &quot;Regeneration&quot; in 2001. The album itself was preceded by the download-only single &quot;At The Indie Disco&quot;.

On 2 September 2016, The Divine Comedy released their eleventh album &quot;Foreverland&quot;. A live album featuring performances from the 2016–17 Foreverland tour, &quot;Loose Canon&quot;, was released digitally on 16 February 2018 after being made available as a CD on the tour.

On 1 April 2019, the Divine Comedy announced a new single &quot;Queuejumper&quot;, first played on BBC 6 Music on 3 April. It was followed by the announcement of &quot;Office Politics&quot;, the band&#x27;s first double album, which was released on 7 June 2019. The release of &quot;Queuejumper&quot; was followed by the single &quot;Norman and Norma&quot;, released on 16 May 2019, and an animated music video for the songs &quot;Infernal Machines&quot; / &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Work in this Town Again&quot;, released on 3 October 2019.

=== Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time ===
The Divine Comedy celebrated its 30th anniversary by reissuing remastered versions of the band&#x27;s first nine albums (from &quot;Liberation&quot; to &quot;Bang Goes the Knighthood&quot;) on LP and CD. All eleven albums were included in the box set &quot;Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time: 30 Years of the Divine Comedy&quot;, released in October 2020. The 24-disc box set consists of 12 albums of two CDs: each with an original remastered album, with a second CD of B-sides, demos, alternate versions, rarities and unreleased material curated by Neil Hannon. The collection includes the original album &quot;Fanfare for the Comic Muse&quot;, and other pre-&quot;Liberation&quot; material. The CD release of &quot;A Short Album About Love&quot; comes with a DVD of &quot;A Short Film About A Short Album About Love&quot; – a previously unreleased 50-minute film of the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire concert at which &quot;Short Album...&quot; was recorded.

Hannon and an eleven-piece ensemble will also be celebrating the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary with residencies at The Barbican in London and the Cité de la Musique in Paris. These shows, postponed from September 2020 to September 2022, will feature the band playing two of the classic albums, per show, in a five-show residency in each venue.

=== &quot;Charmed Life&quot; ===
&quot;Charmed Life&quot;, a double compilation album was released on 4 February 2022. Special limited edition copies included a bonus album, simply named &quot;Super Extra Bonus Album&quot;. Ten days after its release, &quot;Charmed Life&quot; claimed the number one spot on the Official Independent Albums Chart. A European tour of &quot;Charmed Life&quot; followed.

<doc id="507933" wikidata="Q350328" url="?curid=507933" title="Mohammad-Reza Bahonar">
<text>Mohammad-Reza Bahonar (, born 2 February 1952) is an Iranian principlist politician who was member of the Parliament of Iran for 28 years. He is also secretary general of Islamic Society of Engineers and the Front of Followers of the Line of the Imam and the Leader. He is currently member of the Expediency Discernment Council.

==Career==
Bahonar cofounded the Islamic Society of Engineers in 1991. He has been elected as a representative from Kerman and Tehran for six terms. He also served at the Expediency Council for three terms. He is considered a key member of the conservative alliance, and was considered a possible candidate for the post of the speaker or the leader of the conservative faction in the parliament. He later refused to run for the post of speaker possibly because of a deal made inside the conservative alliance, so he decided to run for the post of deputy speaker. He became the first deputy speaker on 6 June 2004 with 188 votes out of 259. The other running candidate for the post of deputy speaker was Mohammad-Hassan Aboutorabi Fard, a representative from Qazvin who became the second deputy speaker with 173 votes.

Following Hassan Rouhani&#x27;s election as President, Bahonar was appointed by Chairman Ali Larijani as the parliament&#x27;s liaison to the newly elected executive branch in transition mandate. On 25 December 2015, he announced he will retiring from his seat in Iranian Parliament after declined to run in 2016 election.

===Attacking Iranian University students===

In a speech at Shiraz University, Bahonar harshly attacked students of Amirkabir University who criticized Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in December 2006. His lecture generated anger among the students. He also called for punishing the students, while accusing them of being sex and alcohol addicts.

<text>National Historic Sites of Canada () are places that have been designated by the federal Minister of the Environment on the advice of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada (HSMBC), as being of national historic significance. Parks Canada, a federal agency, manages the National Historic Sites program. As of November 2023, there were 1,005 National Historic Sites, 171 of which are administered by Parks Canada; the remainder are administered or owned by other levels of government or private entities. The sites are located across all ten provinces and three territories, with two sites located in France (the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and Canadian National Vimy Memorial).

There are related federal designations for National Historic Events and National Historic Persons. Sites, Events and Persons are each typically marked by a federal plaque of the same style, but the markers do not indicate which designation a subject has been given. For example, the Rideau Canal is a National Historic Site, while the Welland Canal is a National Historic Event.

==History==

===Early developments===
Emerging Canadian nationalist sentiment in the late 19th century and early 20th century led to an increased interest in preserving Canada&#x27;s historic sites. There were galvanizing precedents in other countries. With the support of notables such as Victor Hugo and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the &quot;Commission des monuments historique&quot; was created in France in 1837; it published its first list of designated sites, containing 934 entries, in 1840. In the United Kingdom, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty was created in 1894 to protect that country&#x27;s historic and natural heritage. While there was no National Park Service in the United States until 1916, battlefields of the Civil War were designated and managed by the War Department: Chickamauga and Chattanooga (created 1890), Antietam (1890), Shiloh (1894), Gettysburg (1895), Vicksburg (1899), and Chalmette (1907).

Domestically, Lord Dufferin, the Governor General from 1872 to 1878, initiated some of the earliest, high-profile efforts to preserve Canada&#x27;s historic sites. He was instrumental in stopping the demolition of the fortifications of Quebec City, and he was the first public official to call for the creation of a park on the lands next to Niagara Falls.

The 1908 tricentennial of the founding of Quebec City, and the establishment that same year of the National Battlefields Commission to preserve the Plains of Abraham, acted as a catalyst for federal efforts to designate and preserve historic sites across Canada. At the same time, the federal government was looking for ways to extend the National Park system to Eastern Canada. The more populated east did not have the same large expanses of undeveloped Crown land that had become parks in the west, so the Dominion Parks Branch (the predecessor to Parks Canada) looked to historic features to act as focal points for new national parks. In 1914, the Parks Branch undertook a survey of historic sites in Canada, with the objective of creating new recreational areas rather than preserving historic places. Fort Howe in Saint John, New Brunswick was designated a national historic park in 1914, named the &quot;Fort Howe National Park&quot;. The fort was not a site of significant national historic importance, but its designation provided a rationale for the acquisition of land for a park. Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia was also designated in 1917.

In 1919, William James Roche, the Minister of the Interior, was concerned over the fate of old fur trade posts in Western Canada, and he was also being lobbied by historical associations across Canada for federal funds to assist with the preservation and commemoration of local landmarks. At the same time, the Department of Militia and Defence was anxious to transfer old forts, and the associated expenses, to the Parks Branch. Roche asked James B. Harkin, the first Commissioner of Dominion Parks, to develop a departmental heritage policy. Harkin believed that the Parks Branch did not have the necessary expertise to manage historic resources; he was troubled by the relatively weak historic value of Fort Howe, the country&#x27;s first historic park, and feared that the Branch&#x27;s park improvements were incompatible with the heritage attributes of Fort Anne, the second historic park.

===Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada===
On Harkin&#x27;s recommendation, the government created the Advisory Board for Historic Site Preservation (later called the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada) in 1919 in order to advise the Minister on a new program of National Historic Sites. Brigadier General Ernest Alexander Cruikshank, a noted authority on the War of 1812 and the history of Ontario, was chosen as the Board&#x27;s first chairman, a post he held for twenty years. The first place designated and plaqued under the new program was the &quot;Cliff Site&quot; in Port Dover, Ontario, where two priests claimed sovereignty over the Lake Erie region for Louis XIV of France in 1670.

Due to a lack of resources, the HSMBC limited itself to recommending sites for designation, and the focus of the program was on commemoration rather than on preservation. Benjamin Sulte, a member of the HSMBC, wrote to Harkin in 1919 about the significant ruins at the Forges du Saint-Maurice, demonstrating his preference for the installation of a plaque over restoration: &quot;All that can be done in our days is to clear away the heap of stones, in order to reach the foundation walls and plant a sign in the centre of the square thus uncovered.&quot;

In the early years of the program, National Historic Sites were chosen to commemorate battles, important men, the fur trade and political events; the focus was on the &quot;great men and events&quot; credited with establishing the nation. Of the 285 National Historic Sites designated by 1943, 105 represented military history, 52 represented the fur trade and exploration, and 43 represented famous individuals (almost entirely men). There was also a strong bias in favour of commemorating sites in Ontario over other parts of the country. At one point, some members of the HSMBC concluded that there were no sites at all in Prince Edward Island worthy of designation. The then prominence of sites in Ontario related to the War of 1812 and the United Empire Loyalists has been attributed to the influence of Cruikshank, resulting in a &quot;veritable palisade of historical markers along the St. Lawrence&quot;, and in Niagara, promoting a loyalist doctrine of imperial unity with Britain, while commemorating resistance to &quot;Americanism&quot;. Proposals to designate sites related to the immigration of Jews, Blacks and Ukrainians to Canada were rejected, as were attempts to recognize patriots of the Rebellions of 1837. Such was the view of Canadian history by the Board in the first half of the 20th century. The HSMBC at the time has been described by historian Yves Yvon Pelletier as a &quot;Victorian gentlemen&#x27;s club&quot;, made up of self-taught historical scholars, whose decisions were made without public consultation and without the benefit of a secretariat to further investigate the recommendations of Board members.

The following have served as members of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada:
===Evolution of the program===
As time passed and the system grew, the scope of the program and the nature of the designations evolved. By the 1930s, the focus of the heritage movement in Canada had shifted from commemoration to preservation and development. The change was most marked in Ontario, where the Niagara Parks Commission was restoring Fort George and the Department of Highways was restoring Fort Henry. It took the Great Depression to create opportunities for significant heritage preservation projects at the federal level. Although the HSMBC took little interest in these efforts, limiting itself to a commemorative role, the Parks Branch made wide use of government relief funds to hire workers to assist with the restoration of old forts.

In 1943, the interim chairman of the HSMBC, Frederic William Howay, urged his fellow Board members to consider a broader range of designations, and to correct the geographic and thematic imbalance in the designations. In particular, Howay encouraged the HSMBC to pay more attention to economic, social and cultural history, and he urged a moratorium on additional designations related to the War of 1812. In 1951, the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences highlighted the imbalances of the National Historic Sites program, urging a more ambitious program with more attention paid to architectural preservation. In 1955, the &quot;Historic Sites and Monuments Act&quot; was amended to allow the designation of buildings due to their age or design, resulting in a new focus on the designation of Canada&#x27;s built heritage. The 1950s also marked the beginning of the &quot;big project&quot; era, which reached its apogee in the 1960s, in which the federal government invested significant funds in the restoration and reconstruction of high-profile National Historic Sites such as the Halifax Citadel, the Fortress of Louisbourg, the fortifications of Quebec City and the historic core of Dawson City.

The 1970s marked the start of a new shift in the nature of the designations. Of the 473 National Historic Sites designated between 1971 and 1993, the formerly dominant category of political-military events represented only 12 percent of the new designations, with the &quot;Battle of...&quot;-type commemorations being overtaken by sites associated with federal politics. The largest group of designations (43 percent) pertained to historic buildings. By the 1990s, three groups were identified as being underrepresented among National Historic Sites: Aboriginal peoples, women, and ethnic groups other than the French and the English. Efforts were subsequently made to further diversify the designations accordingly. Saoyú-ʔehdacho in the Northwest Territories was designated in 1997, becoming the first National Historic Site both designated and acquired on the basis of consultation with Aboriginal peoples, and the largest National Historic Site in land area (approximately the size of Prince Edward Island). It was at this time that the use of the term &quot;National Historic Park&quot;, then still used for the class of larger National Historic Sites operated by Parks Canada and deemed to be of &quot;extraordinary value to Canadian history&quot;, was phased out.

Changes were not limited to new designations, as the interpretation of many existing National Historic Sites did not remain static and evolved over time. For example, the commemoration of National Historic Sites on the Prairies related to the Red River Rebellion and the North-West Rebellion has gone through at least three phases to date. In the 1920s, plaques erected at these sites trumpeted the expansion of Canada and western civilization across North America. Due to local pressures, changes at the HSMBC and evolving historiography, texts introduced in the 1950s avoided the previous triumphalist version of events, but also avoided any analysis of the causes or consequences of the events. Commencing in the 1970s, a changing approach to heritage conservation at Parks Canada, coupled with growing regionalism and a more assertive Aboriginal rights movement, led to the next generation of interpretative documents, one that included a focus on the societies which Canada&#x27;s 19th-century expansion had displaced.

==Designations==

National Historic Sites are organized according to five broad themes: Peopling the Land, Governing Canada, Developing Economies, Building Social and Community Life, and Expressing Intellectual and Cultural Life. To be commemorated, a site must meet at least one of the following criteria:

*illustrate an exceptional creative achievement in concept and design, technology or planning, or a significant stage in the development of Canada;
*illustrate or symbolize, in whole or in part, a cultural tradition, a way of life or ideas important to the development of Canada;
*be explicitly and meaningfully associated or identified with persons who are deemed to be of national historic significance; or
*be explicitly and meaningfully associated or identified with events that are deemed to be of national historic significance.

Designation as a National Historic Site provides no legal protection for the historic elements of a site. However, historic sites may be designated at more than one level (national, provincial and municipal), and designations at other levels may carry with them some legal protections.

Most National Historic Sites are marked by a federal plaque bearing Canada&#x27;s Coat of Arms. In earlier years, these plaques were erected on purpose-built cairns, and in later years have been attached to buildings or free-standing posts. These maroon and gold markers are typically in English and French, though some are trilingual where another language is relevant to the subject being commemorated.

<doc id="507952" wikidata="Q349487" url="?curid=507952" title="Parks Canada">
<text>Parks Canada (), is the agency of the Government of Canada which manages the country&#x27;s 48 National Parks, three National Marine Conservation Areas, 172 National Historic Sites, one National Urban Park (Rouge National Urban Park), and one National Landmark (Pingo Canadian Landmark). Parks Canada is mandated to &quot;protect and present nationally significant examples of Canada&#x27;s natural and cultural heritage, and foster public understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment in ways that ensure their ecological and commemorative integrity for present and future generations&quot;. 

The agency also administers lands and waters set aside as potential national parklands, including ten National Park Reserves and one National Marine Conservation Area Reserve. More than of lands and waters in national parks and national marine conservation areas has been set aside for such purposes. Parks Canada cooperatively manages a large majority of their protected areas and heritage sites with Indigenous partners. The Canadian Register of Historic Places is supported and managed by the agency, in collaboration with provincial and territorial governments and other federal bodies. The agency is also the working arm of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board, which recommends National Historic Sites, Events, and Persons.

The minister of environment and climate change (Steven Guilbeault since 2021) is responsible for the agency, and it is managed by its chief executive officer (Ron Hallman since 2019). The agency&#x27;s budget was  billion in the 2020–2021 fiscal year and it employed public servants in March 2021.

==History==
Parks Canada was established on May 19, 1911, as the Dominion Parks Branch under the Department of the Interior, becoming the world&#x27;s first national park service. Since its creation, its name has changed, known variously as the Dominion Parks Branch, National Parks Branch, Parks Canada, Environment Canada – Parks Branch, and the Canadian Parks Service, before a return to Parks Canada in 1998. The service&#x27;s activities are regulated under legislation such as the &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot;, and the &quot;Parks Canada Agency Act&quot;, which established the current legal incorporation of the agency in 1998.

To mark the 150th anniversary of Confederation in 2017, Parks Canada offered free passes to national parks and national historic sites for the year.

== Activities ==

===Public safety and enforcement===

Park Wardens protect natural and cultural resources by conducting patrols of National Parks, National Historic sites and National Marine Conservation Areas. They ensure the safety of staff, visitors and residents, and conduct strategic enforcement activities aimed at public peace maintenance, resource protection, visitor enjoyment and administrative compliance. They are designated under section 18 of the &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot; as Park Wardens and are peace officers as defined by the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. They carry firearms and non-lethal intervention options.

The minister may also designate provincial and local enforcement officers under section 19 of the Act for the purpose of enforcing laws within the specified parks. These officers have the power of peace officers only in relation to the &quot;Act&quot;.

In May 2012, it was reported that Park Wardens may be cross designated to enforce certain wildlife acts administered by Environment Canada. Should the designations go ahead it would only be for Park Wardens that are stationed near existing migratory bird sanctuaries.

Essentially the intent of the change is to allow for a faster and lower-cost response to environmental enforcement incidents, particularly in remote areas in the north where Environment Canada does not have an ongoing presence, but Parks Canada has a Park Warden nearby who could act on its behalf, rather than have Environment Canada responded from a farther office.
=== Ecological integrity monitoring ===

According to the &quot;Panel on Ecological Integrity Report&quot; in 2000, &quot;the idea of conserving nature unimpaired has been part of national parks’ legal mandate since 1930&quot;. The term “ecological integrity” was put into the 1988 amendments to the National Parks Act but was in park policy as early as 1979. The Panel on Ecological Integrity Report proposed the following definition: &quot;An ecosystem has integrity when it is deemed characteristic for its natural region, including the composition and abundance of native species and biological communities, rates of change and supporting processes&quot;. There is a significant amount of debate surrounding the definition of ecological integrity. As can be seen through the evolution of the term, ecological integrity is deeply rooted in notions of symbiosis, sustainability, and holistic management practices. There is a fair amount of debate surrounding the definition of the term in the academic world as well. For example, &quot;[ecological integrity] has a high degree of linguistic elasticity and should there ever be a legal challenge to its use, there are no precise and clear definitions for it&quot;. Regardless of the fluidity of the term, there are some common elements, &quot;There are, however, certain common elements found in many definitions: naturalness, wholeness, continuity through time&quot;. 

According to the most recent iteration of the &quot;Canada National Parks Act S.C. 2000, c.32&quot;&quot;.,&quot; Parks Canada is responsible for the ecological integrity of all national parks. To cite section 8 (2): “Maintenance or restoration of ecological integrity through the protection of natural resources and natural processes, shall be the first priority of the Minister when considering all aspects of the management of park” (&quot;Canada National Parks Act, 2000)&quot;. This law put additional onus on Parks Canada Agency to implement a robust science-based conservation and monitoring program.

Following the publication of the &quot;Panel on Ecological Integrity Report&quot; in 2000, Parks Canada Agency released &quot;Status on&quot; &quot;Agency Progress since First Priority&quot; in 2008 as a response. One major stride mentioned is the implementation of a policy requirement for national parks to report on the state of ecological integrity every five years, summarizing reports from monitoring programs in place. This &quot;State of the Park&quot; report was designed to ensure accountability in the management structure of Parks Canada Agency. In the author’s words, “The State of the Park report is the accountability mechanism for Field Unit Superintendents to report to the CEO on achieving the Agency’s Corporate Plan performance expectations related to maintaining and improving ecological integrity”. In addition to this reform, Parks Canada also updated and released the &quot;Agency’s Guide to Management Planning&quot; in 2008 to restructure the agency and ensure that this new integrated approach could be applied to all national parks.

With these changes, Parks Canada formally began monitoring for ecological integrity in 2008 and is ongoing to date. These modifications are consistent with the Office of the Auditor General of Canada’s observations in the 2005 report of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development. For example, “The 6 to 8 ecological integrity indicators for each national park measure the health of Canada&#x27;s national parks by reporting on the indicator’s condition and trend (improving, stable or declining) over time”. This ecological integrity monitoring program summarizes the state of a park&#x27;s ecological integrity using “good, fair, poor”. Parks Canada&#x27;s ecological integrity monitoring program is based on three publications: &quot;Monitoring and Reporting Ecological Integrity in Canada’s National Parks Volume I: Guiding Principles&quot; (2005) and the compendium document, &quot;Volume 2: A Park-Level Guide to Establishing EI Monitoring (2007)&quot;, &quot;Consolidated Guidelines for Ecological Integrity Monitoring in Canada’s National Parks (2011).&quot;

The most recent iteration of guidelines for ecological integrity monitoring, &quot;Consolidated Guidelines for Ecological Integrity Monitoring in Canada’s National Parks&quot;, is significantly more robust and science based. Some of the notable improvements include the integration of a trend variable designed to demonstrate whether the indicator is deteriorating, stable or improving. In addition, the inclusion of quantitative thresholds to determine the state of indicator will allow for more accurate results. Lastly, the incorporation of an &quot;Iceberg Model for EI Indicator&quot; provides a more holistic approach, fostering increasingly complete results.

One of Parks Canada&#x27;s most recent publications, &quot;Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators: Ecological integrity of national parks&quot; (2018), demonstrates how effective Parks Canada&#x27;s recent efforts have been. More exhaustive science-based methodology allows for more precise results and ultimately, better management. This document, and all results, are based on the assessment of 118 ecosystems throughout 42 national parks across Canada. Parks Canada Agency claims that 68 per cent of parks sampled are in good condition, 20 per cent fair, 17 per cent poor. Furthermore, of the 118 ecosystems sampled, 69 per cent are stable, 19.5 per cent are improving and 12 per cent are declining, according to &quot;Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators: Ecological integrity of national parks&quot;. This is a notable improvement, considering that in 2000, 54 per cent of parks were suffering some form of major or severe ecological stresses. In 2018, there are 12 ecosystems rated as poor, 20 EI indicators in decline, particularly forests and freshwater environments. Overall, this improvement is a testament to what Parks Canada Agency&#x27;s ecological integrity monitoring program is capable of.

===Parka (mascot)===
Parka, a female beaver, is Parks Canada&#x27;s mascot. A series of animated shorts starring her are hosted on the organization&#x27;s website and have also been aired on television as interstitials.

==Organization==
The Parks Canada Agency was established as a separate service entity in 1998 and falls under the responsibility of Environment and Climate Change Canada. Before 2003, Parks Canada (under various names) fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Canadian Heritage, where it had been since 1994. From 1979 to 1994, Parks Canada was part of the Department of Environment, and before it was part of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs (1966 to 1978), and the Department of the Interior. With the organizational shifts and political leadership in Canada, the priorities of Parks Canada have shifted over the years more towards conservation and away from development. Starting in the 1960s, Parks Canada has also moved to decentralize its operations.

<text>Solid geometry or stereometry is the geometry of three-dimensional Euclidean space (3D space).
A solid figure is the region of 3D space bounded by a two-dimensional closed surface; for example, a solid ball consists of a sphere and its interior.

Solid geometry deals with the measurements of volumes of various solids, including pyramids, prisms (and other polyhedrons), cubes, cylinders, cones (and truncated cones).

==History==

The Pythagoreans dealt with the regular solids, but the pyramid, prism, cone and cylinder were not studied until the Platonists. Eudoxus established their measurement, proving the pyramid and cone to have one-third the volume of a prism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height. He was probably also the discoverer of a proof that the volume enclosed by a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius.

==Topics==

Basic topics in solid geometry and stereometry include:

* incidence of planes and lines
* dihedral angle and solid angle
* the cube, cuboid, parallelepiped
* the tetrahedron and other pyramids
* prisms
* octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron
* cones and cylinders
* the sphere
* other quadrics: spheroid, ellipsoid, paraboloid and hyperboloids.
Advanced topics include:
* projective geometry of three dimensions (leading to a proof of Desargues&#x27; theorem by using an extra dimension)
* further polyhedra
* descriptive geometry.

==List of solid figures==

Whereas a sphere is the surface of a ball, for other solid figures it is sometimes ambiguous whether the term refers to the surface of the figure or the volume enclosed therein, notably for a cylinder. 
==Techniques==

Various techniques and tools are used in solid geometry. Among them, analytic geometry and vector techniques have a major impact by allowing the systematic use of linear equations and matrix algebra, which are important for higher dimensions.

==Applications==
A major application of solid geometry and stereometry is in 3D computer graphics.

<text>People is an American weekly magazine that specializes in celebrity news and human-interest stories. It is published by Dotdash Meredith, a subsidiary of IAC. With a readership of 46.6 million adults in 2009, &quot;People&quot; had the largest audience of any American magazine, but it fell to second place in 2018 after its readership significantly declined to 35.9 million. &quot;People&quot; had $997 million in advertising revenue in 2011, the highest advertising revenue of any American magazine. In 2006, it had a circulation of 3.75 million and revenue expected to top $1.5 billion. It was named &quot;Magazine of the Year&quot; by &quot;Advertising Age&quot; in October 2005, for excellence in editorial, circulation, and advertising. &quot;People&quot; ranked number 6 on &quot;Advertising Age&quot;″s annual &quot;A-list&quot; and number 3 on &quot;Adweek&quot;″s &quot;Brand Blazers&quot; list in October 2006.

&quot;People&quot;″s website, People.com, focuses on celebrity and crime news, royal updates, fashion and lifestyle recommendations and human interest stories.

&quot;People&quot; is perhaps best known for its yearly special issues naming the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Best &amp; Worst Dressed&quot;, and &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s headquarters are in New York City, and it maintains editorial bureaus in Los Angeles and in London. In 2006, for financial reasons, it closed bureaus in Austin, Miami, and Chicago.

==History==
Andrew Heiskell, who was the chief executive officer of Time Inc. at the time and the former publisher of the weekly &quot;Life&quot; magazine, is credited with coming up with the idea for &quot;People&quot;. The founding managing editor of &quot;People&quot; was Richard Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at &quot;Life&quot; and the journalist who acquired the Zapruder film of the John F. Kennedy assassination for Time Inc. in 1963. &quot;People&quot;″s first publisher was Richard J. &quot;Dick&quot; Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.

Stolley characterized the magazine as &quot;getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.&quot; Stolley&#x27;s almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut on February 25, 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premiere edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress Mia Farrow, then starring in the film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, on the cover. That issue also featured stories on Gloria Vanderbilt, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were missing in action. The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ().

The core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from &quot;Life&quot; magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of ESPN anchor Trey Wingo), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of &quot;Us&quot; magazine) and Robert Emmett Ginna Jr. (a former &quot;Life&quot; writer and also a film and television producer); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of presidential candidate Mitt Romney); former &quot;Time&quot; senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of &quot;Time&quot;″s ill-fated cable television magazine &quot;View&quot;); Chief of Photography, a &quot;Life&quot; photographer, John Loengard, to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy &quot;Life&quot; staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author, and illustrator of the &quot;Lyle The Crocodile&quot; book series for children. Many of the noteworthy &quot;Life&quot; photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends Alfred Eisenstaedt and Gjon Mili and rising stars Co Rentmeester, David Burnett and Bill Eppridge. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joyce Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason, and Jed Horne, later an editor of &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; in New Orleans.

In 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled &quot;People en Español&quot;. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered Tejano singer Selena and the other featuring the hit television series &quot;Friends&quot;; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not. Although the original idea was that Spanish-language translations of articles from the English magazine would comprise half the content, &quot;People en Español&quot; over time came to have entirely original content.

In 2002, &quot;People&quot; introduced &quot;People Stylewatch&quot;, a title focusing on celebrity style, fashion, and beauty – a newsstand extension of its Stylewatch column. Due to its success, the frequency of &quot;People Stylewatch&quot; was increased to 10 times per year in 2007. In spring 2017, People Stylewatch was rebranded as PeopleStyle. In late 2017, it was announced that there would no longer be a print version of PeopleStyle and it would be a digital-only publication.

In Australia, the localized version of &quot;People&quot; is titled &quot;Who&quot; since there was already another magazine published under the title &quot;People&quot;. The international edition of &quot;People&quot; has been published in Greece since 2010.

On July 26, 2013, Outlook Group announced that it was closing down the Indian edition of &quot;People&quot;, which began publication in 2008.

In September 2016, in collaboration with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;People&quot; launched the People/Entertainment Weekly Network. The &quot;free, ad-supported online-video network... covering celebrities, pop culture, lifestyle and human-interest stories&quot;, was rebranded as PeopleTV in September 2017.

In December 2016, LaTavia Roberson engaged in a feud with &quot;People&quot; after alleging they misquoted and misrepresented her interview online.

Meredith purchased Time Inc., including &quot;People&quot;, in 2017. In 2019, &quot;People&quot; editor Jess Cagle announced he was stepping down from his role. It was later announced he would be replaced by deputy editor Dan Wakeford, who previously worked for &quot;In Touch Weekly&quot;. Liz Vaccariello was named the new Editor in Chief on February 23, 2022, replacing Dan Wakeford.

On October 6, 2021, Dotdash agreed to purchase Meredith, which still owned &quot;People&quot; and sister magazines such as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;InStyle&quot;, and &quot;Chip and Joanna Gaines&#x27; Magnolia Journal&quot;, in a $2.7 billion deal. The purchase would be finalized on December 1, 2021.

===&quot;Teen People&quot;===
In 1998, the magazine introduced a version targeted at teens, called &quot;Teen People&quot;. However, on July 27, 2006, the company announced that it would shut down publication of &quot;Teen People&quot; immediately. The last issue to be released was scheduled for September 2006. In exchange, subscribers to this magazine received &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; for the rest of their subscriptions. There were numerous reasons cited for the publication shutdown, including a downfall in ad pages, competition from both other teen-oriented magazines and the internet, and a decrease in circulation numbers. Teenpeople.com was merged into People.com in April 2007. People.com will &quot;carry teen-focused stories that are branded as TeenPeople.com&quot;, Mark Golin, the editor of People.com explained. On the decision to merge the brands, he stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve got traffic on TeenPeople, People is a larger site, why not combine and have the teen traffic going to one place?&quot;

===Competition for celebrity photos===
In a July 2006 &quot;Variety&quot; article, Janice Min, &quot;Us Weekly&quot; editor-in-chief, blamed &quot;People&quot; for the increase in cost to publishers of celebrity photos:

&quot;People&quot; reportedly paid $4.1 million for photos of newborn Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, the child of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. The photos set a single-day traffic record for their website, attracting 26.5 million page views.

===Sexiest Man Alive===
The annual feature the &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; is billed as a benchmark of male attractiveness and typically includes only famous people. It is determined using a procedure similar to the procedure used for &quot;Time&quot;″s Person of the Year. The origin of the title was a discussion on a planned story on Mel Gibson. Someone exclaimed, &quot;Oh my God, he is the sexiest man alive!&quot; And someone else said, &quot;You should use that as a cover line.&quot;

For the first decade or so, the feature appeared at uneven intervals. Originally awarded in the wintertime, it shifted around the calendar, resulting in gaps as short as seven months and as long as a year and a half, with no selection at all during 1994 (21 years later the magazine did select Keanu Reeves to fill the 1994 gap, with runners-up including Hugh Grant and Jim Carrey). Since 1997, the dates have settled between mid-November and early December.

Dates of magazine issues, winners, ages of winners at the time of selection, and pertinent comments are listed below.

, former winners John F. Kennedy Jr., Sean Connery, and Patrick Swayze have since died. Kennedy Jr. and David Beckham are the only non-entertainers to have won the accolade.

===Sexiest Woman Alive===

In December 2014, &quot;People&quot; selected its first and only Sexiest Woman Alive, Kate Upton. Cindy Crawford and Richard Gere were declared &quot;Sexiest Couple of the Year&quot; on October 19, 1993.

===Cutest Baby Alive===
In 2019, &quot;People&quot; selected its first Cutest Baby Alive, Andy Cohen&#x27;s son Benjamin. In 2020, Anderson Cooper&#x27;s son, Wyatt Morgan, was named the Cutest Baby Alive.

===Most Intriguing People of the Year===
At the end of each year &quot;People&quot; magazine famously selects 25 news-making individuals or couples who have received much media attention over the past 12 months and showcases them in a special year-end issue, the &#x27;25 Most Intriguing People of the Year&#x27;. This series of full-page features and half-page featurettes includes world leaders and political activists, famous actors and entertainers, elite athletes, prominent business people, accomplished scientists and occasionally members of the public whose stories have made an unusual impact in news or tabloid media.

===100 Most Beautiful People===
&quot;People&quot;″s 100 Most Beautiful People is an annual list of 100 people judged to be the most beautiful individuals in the world. Until 2006, it was the 50 Most Beautiful People.

Julia Roberts holds the record for most times named, with five. Michelle Pfeiffer, Jennifer Aniston, and Kate Hudson have appeared twice.

In 2020, Goldie Hawn, Kate Hudson, and Hudson&#x27;s daughter Rani made history becoming the first multigenerational cover stars of the Beautiful Issue. In addition, Hawn and her granddaughter concurrently became the oldest and youngest to cover the Beautiful Issue.

=== People Magazine Yearbook ===
People Magazine Yearbook is an annual publication released by publishers of &quot;People&quot; magazine, currently Meredith Corporation. The Yearbook broadly covers all the major events that happened in the year that it covers. This includes socially relevant news events that made headlines around the world in general but more specifically in the United States. Besides the news headlines, it covers celebrity weddings, splits/divorces, births and deaths, and also scandalous events that generated much news when they happened. Over the years, it has covered headlining events in the world of Music (Grammy Awards), Movies (Oscar Awards, The Golden Globe Awards), and Television (Emmy Awards) in a bite sized recap of the event and the award winners. The People Yearbook has had the year (say, 2010) written in Bold accompanying the word &quot;Yearbook&quot; on the front cover since the People Yearbook 1995, although this gradually changed in the more recent editions. Since 2015, the &quot;year&quot; appeared in a more inconspicuous way on the front cover until the 2019 issue and the bold style of writing the &quot;year&quot; made a comeback in the 2020 issue. The year also appears on the spine.

==== Early years ====
The People Magazine Yearbook was first published in the Year 1991 by The Time Inc. Magazine Company and it was called &quot;Private Lives&quot;. This issue did not mention any year conspicuously on the front page or the inner page but the front flap of the hardcover version of the magazine described Private Lives as &quot;&quot;People&#x27;s&quot; chronicle of an extraordinary year - 1990&quot;, clearly describing that the events covered inside were from 1990. Next Year, the 1992 sequel to Private Lives was published and it was called &quot;Private Lives Volume II&quot;. The first page had an additional tagline that described the magazine as The Year in Review: 1991 Private Lives. In 1993, there was another change in the publication and also its cover title. The year was added on the cover for the first time and this annual issue was called &quot;Private Lives 1993&quot;. The &quot;Year&quot; appeared in Bold on the front cover. The first page described the publication as Private Lives The Year in Review: 1992. Next year, in 1994, People Books released Private Lives 1994 with the first page that said Private Lives Year in Review: 1993. The year 1996 ushered in the single biggest change in the magazine title. The title was reworked and found a new moniker - It was called &quot;People Yearbook 1995&quot;. Previous title of &quot;Private Lives&quot; was dropped completely and the publication was defined as a &quot;yearbook&quot; for the first time.

==== Changes over the Years ====
In all the years since its inception, People Magazine Yearbook has covered events from the previous year and not the year on the front cover, and this is true even from the time period when it was called Private Lives. For example, People Magazine Yearbook 2008 covered events of 2007. And People Magazine Yearbook 1998 covered the events of the Year 1997. 2014 was the last year for this to happen. The 2014 yearbook covered events of 2013. In 2015, a shift happened in the magazine that changed for the first time the year it actually covered within its pages. Instead of covering the events of 2014, this issue covered the events of 2015 and arrived on the stands towards the end of 2015. To make the shift properly understood, the first page of this yearbook included a tagline &quot;The Most Memorable Moments of 2015&quot;. With this move, People Magazine Yearbook changed its own 25-year-old tradition. This shift, however, resulted in the year 2014 never being covered by the People Magazine Yearbook and 2014 became the only year not to be covered since its inception in 1991. Since then, the People Magazine Yearbook has been covering events of the same year that are on the Front Page. Another typeface change was experimented for two years when People Magazine Yearbook 2013! and People Magazine Yearbook 2014! had an exclamation mark following the year. This was dropped in the 2015 Yearbook and the publication discarded the exclamation mark. However, this issue dropped the Bold writing of the &quot;Year&quot; on the front cover and replaced it with a more inconspicuous style and it was like that until the 2019 issue.

The 2016 Yearbook was a special &quot;flip cover&quot; issue wherein it combined a special edition memorabilia to cherish the memories of people who died in 2016. The list included Prince, David Bowie, Nancy Reagan, Alan Rickman, Doris Roberts, Muhammad Ali etc. The special edition could be accessed by flipping over the magazine. In November 2017, Meredith Corporation announced that it would acquire Time Inc. for $2.8 billion. The acquisition was completed on January 31, 2018. &quot;Time&quot; Magazine, &quot;People&quot; Magazine and also People Magazine Yearbook are now published by Meredith Corporation. The copyright of the 2018 Yearbook was described as belonging to Time Inc. Books, a division of Meredith Corporation and published by People Books, an imprint of Time Books. This issue included the tagline, &quot;The Most Memorable Moments &quot;of&quot; 2018&quot; on the cover. However, in the 2019 Yearbook, the copyright was described as belonging to Meredith Corporation, without any prominent tagline. The prominent bold writing of the &quot;Year&quot; on the front cover made a comeback with the 2020 Yearbook, along with a tagline saying &quot;Our Extraordinary Year Together&quot;. The trend continued with the 2021 Yearbook, along with a tagline saying, &quot;When We All Got Together Again&quot;.

==Television spinoffs==
The magazine has inspired the television series &quot;People Magazine Investigates&quot;, a true crime series which debuted in 2016 on Investigation Discovery, and &quot;People Puzzler&quot;, a crossword puzzle-themed game show which debuted in 2021 on Game Show Network. In 2024, the six-episode series &quot;People Magazine Investigates: Surviving a Serial Killer&quot; aired on Investigation Discovery.

An earlier TV version of the magazine began as an entertainment news program, hosted by Alan Hamel, Pat Mitchell and Phyllis George, with Peter Stone as an occasional substitute and it was produced by Time-Life Television, aired on CBS in the fall of 1978, and lasted for a few months.

<text>Fortún Ximénez Bertandoña (; died 1533) was a Spanish sailor of Basque origin who led a mutiny during an early expedition along the Pacific Coast of Mexico and is the first European known to have landed in the Baja California peninsula.

Ximénez was the pilot of a ship, the &quot;Concepción&quot;, sent by Hernán Cortés and captained by Diego de Becerra. The ship set out November 30, 1533, to travel north along the coast of New Spain from present-day Manzanillo, Colima, in search of two ships that had been lost without a trace on a similar voyage the previous year. The previous voyages had been in search of the &quot;Strait of Anián&quot; (the western end of the much-hoped-for Northwest Passage) and the Island of California, named for the mythical places in the romance novel, &quot;Las sergas de Esplandián&quot; previously published in Spain and popular among the conquistadors. The fictional California was a terrestrial paradise populated only by dark-skinned women.

During the voyage, Ximénez led a revolt in which the captain was killed. The mutineers then landed near present-day La Paz, on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, which the mutineers believed to be the Island of California. Ximénez was killed in a clash with the local natives. The survivors returned to New Spain with the story of having black pearls, which prompted further exploration of the &quot;Island&quot; of Santa Cruz, as Cortés named the peninsula.

The stories of the survivors prompted several follow-up expeditions by Cortés in the following years, which resulted in very short-lived pearl fisheries.

<doc id="507976" wikidata="Q4601739" url="?curid=507976" title="2003 Phnom Penh riots">
<text>In January 2003, a Cambodian newspaper article falsely alleged that Thai actress Suvanant Kongying claimed that the Angkor Wat belonged to Thailand. Other Cambodian print and radio media picked up the report and furthered nationalistic sentiments, which resulted in riots in Phnom Penh on 29 January where the Thai embassy was burned and commercial properties of Thai businesses were vandalized. The riots reflect the fluid historical relationship between Thailand and Cambodia, as well as the economic, cultural and political factors involving the two countries.

==Background==
===Historical===
Historically, the relationship between Siam (modern Thailand) and Cambodia has been extremely fluid, reflecting the region&#x27;s division into city states rather than nation states. These city states were bound together into empires by more or less strong political, military and tributary ties. In the 14th century, the centre of Thai power passed from Sukhothai to the more southerly Ayutthaya, in territory which had formed part of the Khmer empire. The threat posed by Ayutthaya to Angkor increased as its power grew, and in the 15th century Angkor itself was besieged and sacked, plunging Cambodia into Post-Angkor period.

The ensuing centuries saw numerous further incursions by the Siamese. For much of the 19th century, northern Cambodia, including Angkor, was ruled by Siam. The degree of independence enjoyed by Cambodia fluctuated according to the relative fortunes of Siam, Cambodia, Vietnam and the French colonists.

In 1907, Siam ceded northern Cambodia to France. In the 1930s, this loss became the basis of the nationalist government&#x27;s claim that the area was a &quot;lost territory&quot; which rightfully belonged to Thailand. In 1941, following a war with Vichy France, Thailand briefly regained the territories ceded to France in 1907. This claim was not abandoned until the 1950s.

===Economic===
Thailand&#x27;s rapid economic progress during the 1980s and 1990s made its economy one of the strongest in Southeast Asia. Conversely, the Cambodian Civil War, the Khmer Rouge government and the subsequent government of the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea, which failed to secure United Nations recognition, kept Cambodia economically weak. As a result, Thai businesses dominate part of the Cambodian economy, fuelling resentment.

===Cultural===
Compared to Cambodia, Thailand has a far greater population and is more open to western influences. These factors have given Thailand a substantial cultural influence on Cambodian music and television. This is coupled with a perception on the part of many Cambodians that Thais are arrogant and racist towards their neighbors.

There has been a long history of dispute and misunderstanding between the Khmer and Thais. Conflicts and claims from both sides led to great deal of resentment; this, despite the fact that Thailand&#x27;s and Cambodia&#x27;s cultures are extremely similar. The reason behind Khmer resentment for the Thais stem from the feeling of decline since the days of the Khmer empire, while the Thais have remained dominant in the region.

There have also been different interpretations in the history of the two countries and the era of the Khmer empire. &quot;This lack of understanding is reflected in the thinking of a considerable number of educated Thais and member of the ruling class, who distinguish between the Khom and the Khmer, considering them to be two separate ethnic group&quot;. They further go on to assert that &quot;it was the Khom, not the Khmer, who built the majestic temple complexes at Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom and founded one of the world&#x27;s truly magnificent ancient empires&quot;.

The Khmer resentment towards this attitude of Thai-centric view of historical accounts—true or not, was not newly founded in 2003. Despite the world consensus that the culture and the empire that rule the region originated from the Khmer; the fact that there are Thais that claim otherwise could be seen as an insult by some Khmer. In the 19th century the Khmer kingdom narrowly escaped being swallowed by two stronger neighbors, Thailand on the west and Vietnam on the east. This created a fear in many Khmer that the neighboring country was out to conquer and erase Khmer identity.

==Cause of the riots==
The riots were prompted by a 18 January article in the Cambodian newspaper &quot;Rasmei Angkor&quot; (&quot;Light of Angkor&quot;). The article alleged that Thai actress Suvanant Kongying said Cambodia had &quot;stolen&quot; Angkor Wat, and that she would not appear in Cambodia until it was returned to Thailand. The newspaper&#x27;s editor gave the source for the story as a group of Khmer nationalists who said they had seen the actress on television. No evidence to support the newspaper&#x27;s claim has ever emerged, and it seems that the report was either fabricated or arose from a misunderstanding of what Suvanant&#x27;s character had said. 

The report was picked up by Khmer radio and print media, and copies of the &quot;Rasmei Angkor&quot; article were distributed in schools. On 27 January, Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen repeated the allegations, and said that Suvanant was &quot;not worth a few blades of grass near the temple&quot;. On 28 January, the Cambodian government then banned all Thai television programs in the country.

Strong nationalistic sentiments were also present during the build up to the riot. &quot;Nationalism has over the years been exploited by the two countries&#x27; political leaders to fulfil [sic] a myriad of their own political interests&quot;. Some have argued that the ruling Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) had a political incentive to orchestrate the riots. After the arrest of Mam Sonando, &quot;Phnom Penh&#x27;s then Governor Chea Sophara, an increasingly popular CPP politician (who had been tipped by some to challenge Hun Sen as a PM candidate) was sacked&quot;. Coincidental or not the events that followed the 2003 riot, was beneficial to the Prime Minister of Cambodia.

==The riots==
On 29 January, rioters attacked the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh, destroying the building. Mobs also attacked the premises of Thai-owned businesses, including Thai Airways International and Shin Corp, owned by the family of then Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. A photograph of a Cambodian man holding a burning portrait of the revered King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej enraged many Thai people.

The Thai government sent military aircraft to Cambodia to evacuate Thai nationals, while Thais demonstrated outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok.

Responsibility for the riots was disputed: Hun Sen attributed the government&#x27;s failure to prevent the attacks to &quot;incompetence&quot;, and said that the riots were stirred up by &quot;extremists&quot;. The chairman of the National Assembly, Prince Norodom Ranariddh claimed that opposition leader Sam Rainsy had directed the attacks. Rainsy said that he had attempted to prevent the violence.

Some, including the Thai ambassador to Cambodia at the time, argue that the 29 January 2003 riot was orchestrated. Cambodians and Thais alike, in online discussions, asserted that &quot;Hun Sen and elements of the CPP were behind the demonstration&quot;. The Cambodian prime minister made a speech, just two days prior to the riot, which further reinforced the allegation that was made about the Thai actress&#x27;s comment. Also &quot;despite desperate calls from the frantic Thai ambassador to the Cambodian Foreign Minister, police and Defence Ministry, Cambodian official and police did little to discourage the crowd&quot;. The Thai embassy was within very close proximity to the Ministry of Interior and the headquarters of the CPP.

==Aftermath==
The Thai government closed the country&#x27;s border with Cambodia following the riots, but only to Thai and Cambodian nationals. The border was re-opened on 21 March 2003, following the Cambodian government&#x27;s payment of US$6 million compensation for the destruction of the Thai embassy. In a 2006 rally against Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, several influential Thai diplomats, including former ambassador to the UN Asda Jayanama and former ambassador to Vietnam Supapong Jayanama, alleged that only half of the compensation was actually paid. The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied this accusation. The Cambodian government also agreed to compensate individual Thai businesses for the losses which they had suffered, to be negotiated separately.

Shortly after the riots, a wave of arrests which totalled more than 150 persons was criticized by human rights groups, highlighting irregularities in the procedures and denial by the authorities to monitor their detention conditions. The owner of Beehive Radio, Mam Sonando, and Chan Sivutha, Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Reaksmei Angkor&quot;, were both arrested without warrants, charged with incitement to commit a crime, incitement to discrimination and announcement of false information. They were later on released on bail and no trial was ever held.

<doc id="507981" wikidata="Q17015203" url="?curid=507981" title="Religious antisemitism">
<text>Religious antisemitism is the aversion to or discrimination against Jews as a whole based on religious doctrines of supersession, which expect or demand the disappearance of Judaism and the conversion of Jews to other faiths. This form of antisemitism has frequently served as the basis for false claims and religious antisemitic tropes against Judaism. Sometimes, it is called theological antisemitism.

Some scholars have argued that modern antisemitism is primarily based on nonreligious factors, John Higham is emblematic of this school of thought. However, this interpretation has been challenged. In 1966, Charles Glock and Rodney Stark first published public opinion polling data, which showed that most Americans based their stereotypes of Jews on religion. Since then, further opinion polling in America and Europe has supported this conclusion.

==Origins==
Father Edward Flannery, in his 1965 book &quot;The Anguish of the Jew: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism&quot;, traces the first clear examples of specific anti-Jewish sentiment back to Alexandria in the third century BCE. Flannery writes that it was the Jews&#x27; refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses &quot;in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life.&quot; Manetho, an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian lepers who had been taught by Moses &quot;not to adore the gods&quot;. The same themes appeared in the works of Chaeremon, Lysimachus, Poseidonius, Apollonius Molon, Apion and Tacitus. Agatharchides of Cnidus wrote about the &quot;ridiculous practices&quot; of the Jews and of the &quot;absurdity of their Law&quot;, and how Ptolemy Lagus was able to invade Jerusalem in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the Sabbath. David Nirenberg also charts this history in &quot;Antijudaism: The Western Tradition&quot;.

==Christian antisemitism==

Christian religious antisemitism is often expressed as anti-Judaism (i.e., it is argued that the antipathy is to the practices of Judaism). As such, it is argued, antisemitism would cease if Jews stopped practicing or changed their public faith, especially by converting to Christianity. However, there have been times when converts were also discriminated against, as in the case of the liturgical exclusion of Jewish converts, which occurred during the late 15th and 16th centuries, when Christianized &quot;Marranos&quot; or Iberian Jews were accused of secretly practicing Judaism or Jewish customs.

===New Testament and antisemitism===

Frederick Schweitzer and Marvin Perry write that the authors of the gospel account sought to place responsibility for the Crucifixion of Jesus and his death on Jews rather than the Roman emperor or Pontius Pilate. As a result, Christians for centuries viewed Jews as &quot;the Christ Killers&quot;. The destruction of the Second Temple was seen as a judgment from God to the Jews for that death, and Jews were seen as &quot;a people condemned forever to suffer exile and degradation&quot;. According to historian Edward H. Flannery, the Gospel of John in particular contains many verses that refer to Jews in a pejorative manner.

In , Paul states that the Churches in Judea had been persecuted by the Jews who killed Jesus and that such people displease God, oppose all men, and had prevented Paul from speaking to the gentile nations concerning the New Testament message. Described by Hyam Maccoby as &quot;the most explicit outburst against Jews in Paul&#x27;s Epistles&quot;, these verses have repeatedly been employed for antisemitic purposes. Maccoby views it as one of Paul&#x27;s innovations responsible for creating Christian antisemitism, though he notes that some have argued these particular verses are later interpolations not written by Paul. Craig Blomberg claims that viewing them as antisemitic is a mistake, but &quot;understandable in light of [Paul&#x27;s] harsh words&quot;. In his view, Paul is not condemning all Jews forever, but merely those he believed had specifically persecuted the prophets, Jesus, or the 1st-century church. Blomberg sees Paul&#x27;s words here as no different in kind than the harsh words the prophets of the Old Testament have for the Jews.

The Codex Sinaiticus contains two extra books in the New Testament—the Shepherd of Hermas and the Epistle of Barnabas. The latter emphasizes the claim that it was the Jews, not the Romans, who killed Jesus and is full of antisemitism. The Epistle of Barnabas was not accepted as part of the canon; Professor Bart Ehrman has stated, &quot;the suffering of Jews in the subsequent centuries would, if possible, have been even worse had the Epistle of Barnabas remained&quot;.

===Early Christianity===
Many early and influential Church works—such as the dialogues of Justin Martyr, the homilies of John Chrysostom, and the testimonies of the church father Cyprian—are strongly anti-Jewish.

During a discussion on the celebration of Easter during the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, Roman emperor Constantine said, ... it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews, who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin, and are, therefore, deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul. ... Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way.

Prejudice against Jews in the Roman Empire was formalized in 438, when the &quot;Code of Theodosius II&quot; established Christianity as the only legal religion in the Roman Empire. The Justinian Code a century later stripped Jews of many of their rights, and Church councils throughout the 6th and 7th centuries, including the Council of Orleans, further enforced anti-Jewish provisions. These restrictions began as early as 305, when, in Elvira (now Granada), a Spanish town in Andalucia, the first known laws of any church council against Jews appeared. Christian women were forbidden to marry Jews unless the betrothed Jewish male first converted to Catholicism. Jews were forbidden to extend hospitality to Catholics. Jews could not keep Catholic Christian concubines and were forbidden to bless the fields of Catholics. In 589, in Catholic Iberia, the Third Council of Toledo ordered that children born of a marriage between Jews and Catholics be baptized by force. By the Twelfth Council of Toledo (681), a policy of forced conversion of all Jews was initiated (Liber Judicum, II.2 as given in Roth). Thousands fled, and others converted to Roman Catholicism.

====Accusations of deicide====

Although never a part of Christian dogma, many Christians, including members of the clergy, held the Jewish people under an antisemitic canard to be collectively responsible for deicide, the killing of Jesus, who they believed was the son of God. According to this interpretation, some Christian traditions historically attributed responsibility for Jesus’ death to the Jewish people present at the time, as well as collectively over generations, labeling it as the sin of deicide, or God-killing. This belief played a significant role in fueling antisemitic attitudes and actions in various Christian societies throughout history.

Passion plays are dramatic stagings representing the trial and death of Jesus, and they have historically been used in remembrance of Jesus&#x27; death during Lent. These plays historically blamed the Jews for the death of Jesus in a polemical fashion, depicting a crowd of Jewish people condemning Jesus to death by crucifixion and a Jewish leader assuming eternal collective guilt for the crowd for the murder of Jesus, which, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; explains, &quot;for centuries prompted vicious attacks—or pogroms—on Europe&#x27;s Jewish communities&quot;.

====Blood libel====
Blood libels are false accusations that Jews use human blood in religious rituals. Historically, these are accusations that the blood of Christian children is especially coveted. In many cases, blood libels served as the basis for a blood libel cult, in which the alleged victim of human sacrifice was elevated to the status of a martyr and, in some cases, canonized.

Although the first known instance of a blood libel is found in the writings of Apion, who claimed that the Jews sacrificed Greek victims in the Temple, no further incidents are recorded until the 12th century when blood libels began to proliferate. These libels have persisted from then through the 21st century.

In the modern era, the blood libel continues to be a major aspect of antisemitism. It has extended its reach to accuse Jews of many different forms of harm that can be carried out against other people.

===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===

Antisemitism was widespread in Europe during the Middle Ages. In those times, the main cause of prejudice against Jews in Europe was the religious one. Although not part of Roman Catholic dogma, many Christians, including members of the clergy, held the Jewish people collectively responsible for the death of Jesus, a practice originated by Melito of Sardis.

Among socio-economic factors were restrictions by the authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed the doors for many professions to the Jews, pushing them into occupations considered socially inferior such as accounting, rent-collecting, and moneylending, which was tolerated then as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. During the Black Death, Jews were accused of being the cause and were often killed. There were expulsions of Jews from England, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain during the Middle Ages as a result of antisemitism.
German for &quot;Jews&#x27; sow&quot;, &quot;Judensau&quot; was the derogatory and dehumanizing imagery of Jews that appeared around the 13th century. Its popularity lasted for over 600 years and was revived by the Nazis. The Jews, typically portrayed in obscene contact with unclean animals such as pigs or owls or representing a devil, appeared on cathedral or church ceilings, pillars, utensils, etchings, etc. Often, the images combined several antisemitic motifs and included derisive prose or poetry.
&quot;Dozens of Judensaus... intersect with the portrayal of the Jew as a Christ killer. Various illustrations of the murder of Simon of Trent blended images of Judensau, the devil, the murder of little Simon himself, and the Crucifixion. In the 17th-century engraving from Frankfurt... a well-dressed, very contemporary-looking Jew has mounted the sow backward and holds her tail, while a second Jew sucks at her milk and a third eats her feces. The horned devil, himself wearing a Jewish badge, looks on and the butchered Simon, splayed as if on a cross, appears on a panel above.&quot;

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot;, considered to be one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time, the villain Shylock was a Jewish moneylender. By the end of the play, he is mocked on the streets after his daughter elopes with a Christian. Shylock, then, compulsorily converts to Christianity as a part of a deal gone wrong. This has raised profound implications regarding Shakespeare and antisemitism.

During the Middle Ages, the story of Jephonias, the Jew who tried to overturn Mary&#x27;s funeral bier, changed from his converting to Christianity into his simply having his hands cut off by an angel.
On many occasions, Jews were subjected to blood libels, false accusations of drinking the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian Eucharist.
Jews were subject to a wide range of legal restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations of which varied with place and time and were determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often, Jews were barred from all occupations except money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden.

===19th century===
Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century, the Roman Catholic Church still incorporated strong antisemitic elements, despite increasing attempts to separate anti-Judaism, the opposition to the Jewish religion on religious grounds, and racial antisemitism. Pope Pius VII (1800–1823) had the walls of the Jewish Ghetto in Rome rebuilt after the Jews were released by Napoleon, and Jews were restricted to the Ghetto through the end of the Papal States in 1870.

Additionally, official organizations such as the Jesuits banned candidates &quot;who are descended from the Jewish race unless it is clear that their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have belonged to the Catholic Church&quot; until 1946. Brown University historian David Kertzer, working from the Vatican archive, has further argued in his book &quot;The Popes Against the Jews&quot; that in the 19th century and early 20th century, the Church adhered to a distinction between &quot;good antisemitism&quot; and &quot;bad antisemitism&quot;.

The &quot;bad&quot; kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The &quot;good&quot; kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about the accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds and, when accused of promoting hatred of Jews, would remind people that they condemned the &quot;bad&quot; kind of antisemitism. Kertzer&#x27;s work is not, therefore, without critics; the scholar of Jewish-Christian relations Rabbi David G. Dalin, for example, criticized Kertzer in the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; for using evidence selectively.

===The Holocaust===

The Nazis used Martin Luther&#x27;s book, &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot; (1543), to claim a moral righteousness for their ideology. Luther seems to advocate the murder of those Jews who refused to convert to Christianity, writing that &quot;we are at fault in not slaying them&quot;

Archbishop Robert Runcie has asserted that: &quot;Without centuries of Christian antisemitism, Hitler&#x27;s passionate hatred would never have been so fervently echoed...because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of Jesus. On Good Friday Jews, have in times past, cowered behind locked doors with fear of a Christian mob seeking &#x27;revenge&#x27; for deicide. Without the poisoning of Christian minds through the centuries, the Holocaust is unthinkable.&quot; The dissident Catholic priest Hans Küng has written in his book &quot;On Being a Christian&quot; that &quot;Nazi anti-Judaism was the work of godless, anti-Christian criminals. But it would not have been possible without the almost two thousand years&#x27; pre-history of &#x27;Christian&#x27; anti-Judaism...&quot;

The document Dabru Emet was issued by many American Jewish scholars in 2000 as a statement about Jewish-Christian relations. This document states,
Nazism was not a Christian phenomenon. Without the long history of Christian anti-Judaism and Christian violence against Jews, Nazi ideology could not have taken hold nor could it have been carried out. Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to, Nazi atrocities against Jews. Other Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities. But Nazism itself was not an inevitable outcome of Christianity.

According to American historian Lucy Dawidowicz, antisemitism has a long history within Christianity. The line of &quot;antisemitic descent&quot; from Luther, the author of &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot;, to Hitler is &quot;easy to draw&quot;. In her &quot;The War Against the Jews, 1933-1945&quot;, she contends that Luther and Hitler were obsessed with the &quot;demonologized universe&quot; inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz writes that the similarities between Luther&#x27;s anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence because they derived from a common history of &quot;Judenhass&quot;, which can be traced to Haman&#x27;s advice to Ahasuerus. Although modern German antisemitism also has its roots in German nationalism and the liberal revolution of 1848, Christian antisemitism, she writes, is a foundation that was laid by the Roman Catholic Church and &quot;upon which Luther built&quot;. Dawidowicz&#x27;s allegations and positions are criticized and not accepted by most historians, however. For example, in &quot;Studying the Jew&quot; Alan Steinweis notes that, &quot;Old-fashioned antisemitism, Hitler argued, was insufficient, and would lead only to pogroms, which contribute little to a permanent solution. This is why, Hitler maintained, it was important to promote &#x27;an antisemitism of reason,&#x27; one that acknowledged the racial basis of Jewry.&quot; Interviews with Nazis by other historians show that the Nazis thought that their views were rooted in biology, not historical prejudices. For example, &quot;S. became a missionary for this biomedical vision... As for anti-Semitic attitudes and actions, he insisted that &#x27;the racial question... [and] resentment of the Jewish race... had nothing to do with medieval anti-Semitism...&#x27; That is, it was all a matter of scientific biology and of community.&quot;

===Post-Holocaust===
The Second Vatican Council, the &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; document, and the efforts of Pope John Paul II helped reconcile Jews and Catholicism in recent decades, however. According to Catholic Holocaust scholar Michael Phayer, the Church as a whole recognized its failings during the council, when it corrected the traditional beliefs of the Jews having committed deicide and affirmed that they remained God&#x27;s chosen people.

In 1994, the Church Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States and a member of the Lutheran World Federation publicly rejected Luther&#x27;s antisemitic writings.

==Islamic antisemitism==
With the origin of Islam in the 7th century AD and its rapid spread through the Arabian Peninsula and beyond, Jews (and many other peoples) became subject to the will of Muslim rulers. The quality of the rule varied considerably in different periods, as did the attitudes of the rulers, government officials, clergy and general population to various subject peoples from time to time, which was reflected in their treatment of these subjects.

Various definitions of antisemitism in the context of Islam are given. The extent of antisemitism among Muslims varies depending on the chosen definition:
* Scholars like Claude Cahen and Shelomo Dov Goitein define it to be the animosity specifically applied to Jews only and do not include discriminations practiced against Non-Muslims in general. For these scholars, antisemitism in Medieval Islam has been local and sporadic rather than general and endemic [Shelomo Dov Goitein], not at all present [Claude Cahen], or rarely present.
* According to Bernard Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of &quot;cosmic evil&quot;. For Lewis, from the late 19th century, movements appear among Muslims of which for the first time one can legitimately use the technical term antisemitic. However, he describes demonizing beliefs, anti-Jewish discrimination and systematic humiliations, as an &quot;inherent&quot; part of the traditional Muslim world, even if violent persecutions were relatively rare.

===Pre-modern times===

According to Jane Gerber, &quot;the Muslim is continually influenced by the theological threads of anti-Semitism embedded in the earliest chapters of Islamic history.&quot; In the light of the Jewish defeat at the hands of Muhammad, Muslims traditionally viewed Jews with contempt and as objects of ridicule. Jews were seen as hostile, cunning, and vindictive, but nevertheless weak and ineffectual. Cowardice was the quality most frequently attributed to Jews. Another stereotype associated with the Jews was their alleged propensity to trickery and deceit. While most anti-Jewish polemicists saw those qualities as inherently Jewish, Ibn Khaldun attributed them to the mistreatment of Jews at the hands of the dominant nations. For that reason, says Ibn Khaldun, Jews &quot;are renowned, in every age and climate, for their wickedness and their slyness&quot;.

Muhammad&#x27;s attitude towards Jews was basically neutral at the beginning. During his lifetime, Jews lived on the Arabian Peninsula, especially in and around Medina. They refused to accept Muhammad&#x27;s teachings. Eventually he fought them, defeated them, and most of them were killed. The traditional biographies of Muhammad describe the expulsion of the Banu Qaynuqa in the post Badrperiod, after a marketplace quarrel broke out between the Muslims and the Jews in Medina and Muhammad&#x27;s negotiations with the tribe failed.

Following his defeat in the Battle of Uhud, Muhammad said he received a divine revelation that the Jewish tribe of the Banu Nadir wanted to assassinate him. Muhammad besieged the Banu Nadir and expelled them from Medina. Muhammad also attacked the Jews of the Khaybar oasis near Medina and defeated them, after they had betrayed the Muslims in a time of war, and he only allowed them to stay in the oasis on the condition that they deliver one-half of their annual produce to Muslims.

Anti-Jewish sentiments in certain historical contexts often intensified during periods of Muslim political or military instability or when Muslims perceived that certain Jewish individuals or communities had acted outside the social norms and restrictions established by Islamic law. In Spain, ibn Hazm and Abu Ishaq focused their anti-Jewish writings on the latter allegation. This was also the chief motivating factor behind the massacres of Jews in Granada in 1066, when nearly 3,000 Jews were killed, and in Fez in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed. There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.

Islamic law does not differentiate between Jews and Christians in their status as &quot;dhimmis&quot;. According to Bernard Lewis, the normal practice of Muslim governments until modern times was consistent with this aspect of sharia law. This view is countered by Jane Gerber, who maintains that of all dhimmis, Jews had the lowest status. Gerber maintains that this situation was especially pronounced in the latter centuries in the Ottoman Empire, where Christian communities enjoyed protection from the European countries, which was unavailable to the Jews. For example, in 18th-century Damascus, a Muslim noble held a festival, inviting to it all social classes in descending order, according to their social status: the Jews outranked only the peasants and the prostitutes.

===Jews in Islamic texts===
Leon Poliakov, Walter Laqueur, and Jane Gerber, suggest that later passages in the Quran contain very sharp attacks on Jews for their refusal to recognize Muhammad as a prophet of God. There are also Quranic verses, particularly from the earliest Quranic surahs, showing respect for the Jews (e.g. see , ) and preaching tolerance (e.g. see ). This positive view tended to disappear in the later Surahs. Taking it all together, the Quran differentiates between &quot;good and bad&quot; Jews, Poliakov states. Laqueur argues that the conflicting statements about Jews in the Muslim holy text have defined Arab and Muslim attitudes towards Jews to this day, especially during periods of rising Islamic fundamentalism.

===Differences with Christianity===
Bernard Lewis holds that Muslims were not antisemitic in the way Christians were for the most part because:
# The Gospels are not part of the educational system in Muslim societies and therefore, Muslims are not brought up with the stories of Jewish deicide; on the contrary, the notion of deicide is rejected by the Quran as a blasphemous absurdity.
# Muhammad and his early followers were not Jews and therefore, they did not present themselves as the true Israel or feel threatened by the survival of the old Israel.
# The Quran was not viewed by Muslims as a fulfillment of the Hebrew Bible, but rather as a restorer of its original messages that had been distorted over time. Thus no clash of interpretations between Judaism and Islam could arise.
# Muhammad was not killed by the Jewish community and he was ultimately victorious in his clash with the Jewish community in Medina.
# Muhammad did not claim to be either the Son of God or the Messiah. Instead, he claimed that he was only a prophet; a claim which Jews repudiated less.
# Muslims saw the conflict between Muhammad and the Jews as something of minor importance in Muhammad&#x27;s career.

===Status of Jews under Muslim rule===
Before the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Jews who lived in Muslim lands, known as dhimmis (along with Christians), were allowed to practice their religion, and they were also allowed to administer their internal affairs, but they were subjected to certain conditions. They had to pay the jizya (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims. Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims. The most degrading one was the requirement of distinctive clothing, not found in the Quran or the hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad; its enforcement was highly erratic. Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.

Some notable massacres of Jews include the 1066 Granada massacre, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada, crucified Jewish vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred most of the Jewish population of the city. &quot;More than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day.&quot; This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule. There was also the killing or forcible conversion of them by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in Al-Andalus in the 12th century. Notable examples of the cases where the choice of residence was taken away from them includes confining Jews to walled quarters (mellahs) in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century. Most conversions were voluntary and happened for various reasons. However, there were some forced conversions in the 12th century under the Almohaddynasty of North Africa and al-Andalus as well as in Persia.

===Medieval period===
The portrayal of the Jews in the early Islamic texts played a key role in shaping the attitudes towards them in the Muslim societies. According to Jane Gerber, &quot;the Muslim is continually influenced by the theological threads of anti-Semitism embedded in the earliest chapters of Islamic history.&quot; In the light of the Jewish defeat at the hands of Muhammad, Muslims traditionally viewed Jews with contempt and as objects of ridicule. Jews were seen as hostile, cunning, and vindictive, but nevertheless weak and ineffectual. Cowardice was the quality most frequently attributed to Jews. Another stereotype associated with the Jews was their alleged propensity to trickery and deceit. While most anti-Jewish polemicists saw those qualities as inherently Jewish, Ibn Khaldun attributed them to the mistreatment of Jews at the hands of the dominant nations. For that reason, says ibn Khaldun, Jews &quot;are renowned, in every age and climate, for their wickedness and their slyness&quot;.

Some Muslim writers have inserted racial overtones in their anti-Jewish polemics. Al-Jahiz speaks of the deterioration of the Jewish stock due to excessive inbreeding. Ibn Hazm also implies racial qualities in his attacks on the Jews. However, these were exceptions, and the racial theme left little or no trace in the medieval Muslim anti-Jewish writings.

Anti-Jewish sentiments usually flared up at times of the Muslim political or military weakness or when Muslims felt that some Jews had overstepped the boundary of humiliation prescribed to them by the Islamic law. In Moorish Iberia, ibn Hazm and Abu Ishaq focused their anti-Jewish writings on the latter allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the 1066 Granada massacre, when &quot;[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day&quot;, and in Fez in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed. There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.

Islamic law does not differentiate between Jews and Christians in their status as dhimmis. According to Bernard Lewis, the normal practice of Muslim governments until modern times was consistent with this aspect of sharia law. This view is countered by Jane Gerber, who maintains that of all dhimmis, Jews had the lowest status. Gerber maintains that this situation was especially pronounced in the latter centuries, when Christian communities enjoyed protection, unavailable to the Jews, under the provisions of Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. For example, in 18th century Damascus, a Muslim noble held a festival, inviting to it all social classes in descending order, according to their social status: the Jews outranked only the peasants and prostitutes. In 1865, when the equality of all subjects of the Ottoman Empire was proclaimed, Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, a high-ranking official observed: &quot;whereas in former times, in the Ottoman State, the communities were ranked, with the Muslims first, then the Greeks, then the Armenians, then the Jews, now all of them were put on the same level. Some Greeks objected to this, saying: &#x27;The government has put us together with the Jews. We were content with the supremacy of Islam.

Some scholars have questioned the correctness of the term &quot;antisemitism&quot; to Muslim culture in pre-modern times. Robert Chazan and Alan Davies argue that the most obvious difference between pre-modern Islam and pre-modern Christendom was the &quot;rich melange of racial, ethic, and religious communities&quot; in Islamic countries, within which &quot;the Jews were by no means obvious as lone dissenters, as they had been earlier in the world of polytheism or subsequently in most of medieval Christendom.&quot; According to Chazan and Davies, this lack of uniqueness ameliorated the circumstances of Jews in the medieval world of Islam. According to Norman Stillman, antisemitism, understood as hatred of Jews as Jews, &quot;did exist in the medieval Arab world even in the period of greatest tolerance&quot;. Also see Bostom, Bat Ye&#x27;or, and the CSPI issued text, supporting Stillman and cited in the bibliography.

===Nineteenth century===
Historian Martin Gilbert wrote that in the 19th century the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries. There was a massacre of Jews in Baghdad in 1828 and in 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Mashhad, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the Torah scrolls. It was only by forcible conversion that a massacre was averted. There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.

In 1840, the Jews of Damascus were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having used their blood to bake Passover bread or Matza. A Jewish barber was tortured until he &quot;confessed&quot;; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the Jews of Libya were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in Marrakech and Fez in Morocco. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in Tunis, and an Arab mob looted Jewish homes and stores, and burned synagogues, on Jerba Island. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in Demnat, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1891, the leading Muslims in Jerusalem asked the Ottoman authorities in Constantinople to prohibit the entry of Jews arriving en masse from Russia. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in Tripolitania.

Benny Morris writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: &quot;I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish gaberdine. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.&quot;

According to Mark Cohen in &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies&quot;, most scholars conclude that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the 19th century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalism, and was imported into the Arab world primarily by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it &quot;Islamized&quot;).

===Modern Islamic antisemitism===

The massacres of Jews in Muslim countries continued into the 20th century. Martin Gilbert writes that 40 Jews were murdered in Taza, Morocco, in 1903. In Yemen in 1905, old laws were revived, they forbade Jews from raising their voices in front of Muslims, they forbade Jews from building their houses higher than the houses of Muslims, and they forbade Jews from engaging in any traditional Muslim trade or occupation. The Jewish quarter in Fez was almost destroyed by a Muslim mob in 1912.

Antagonism and violence intensified as resentment against Zionist efforts in the British Mandate of Palestine spread. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, played a key role in stoking violent opposition to Zionism and he closely allied himself with the Nazi regime. From 1941 al-Husayni was based in Germany from where he urged attacks on Jews. There were Nazi-inspired pogroms in Algeria in the 1930s, and massive attacks on the Jews in Iraq and Libya in the 1940s (see Farhud). Pro-Nazi Muslims slaughtered dozens of Jews in Baghdad in 1941.

Holocaust denial and Holocaust minimization efforts have found increasingly overt acceptance as sanctioned historical discourse in a number of Middle Eastern countries. Arabic and Turkish editions of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; have found an audience in the region with limited critical response by local intellectuals and media.

According to Robert Satloff, both as rescuers and perpetrators, Muslims and Arabs were involved in the Holocaust during the pro-Nazi rule of Vichy in French North Africa, as well as during the Italian and German Nazi occupations of Tunisia and Libya.

According to a Pew Global Attitudes Project report released on August 14, 2005, anti-Jewish sentiment was endemic. Of six Muslim majority countries surveyed, all have high percentages of their populations with unfavorable views of Jews. Turkey reported that 60% had unfavorable views of Jews, Pakistan reported 74%, Indonesia reported 76%, and Morocco reported 88%. 99% of Lebanese Muslims viewed Jews unfavorably, as did 99% of the Jordanian people.

George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the Arab world to several factors, including the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire and traditional Islamic society; domination by Western colonial powers under which Jews gained a larger role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of Arab nationalism, whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment against Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular regimes to scapegoat local Jews for political purposes.

<text>Michel Camdessus (born 1 May 1933) is a French economist who served as the seventh managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 1987 to 2000, making him the longest-serving in that position. Prior to his tenure at the IMF, he served as the Governor of the Banque de France from 1984 to 1987, after a brief term as Deputy Governor from August to November 1984 when elevated to the top position.

One notable events during his tenure at the IMF was the 1997 East Asian financial crisis. His role during the crisis has drawn criticism, for not paying attention to the unique circumstances of the East Asian countries and blindly imposing the measures that were followed in Mexico, leading to considerable turmoil and rioting in countries such as Indonesia.

Born in Bayonne, France, Mr. Camdessus studied at the University of Paris and earned postgraduate degrees in economics from the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po)&quot; in Paris and &quot;École nationale d&#x27;administration&quot;.

Camdessus is currently the president of the social initiative (&quot;French social weeks&quot;), a social initiative, and a member of the Commission for Africa established by Tony Blair. He is also a member of the Pontifical Commission for Justice and Peace.

Additionally, Camdessus is a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa. As part of this Panel, he contributes to coalition-building, leverage and broker knowledge sharing, and influencing policies for lasting change in Africa.

He is also a member of the board of directors of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s, founded by former French president Jacques Chirac in 2008 to promote world peace. Camdessus participates in the jury for the Conflict Prevention Prize awarded every year by this foundation, and in the scientific committee of its Water and Sanitation program.

<doc id="507987" wikidata="Q722559" url="?curid=507987" title="Mohammad-Javad Bahonar">
<text>Mohammad-Javad Bahonar (, 5 September 1933 – 30 August 1981) was a Shia Iranian theologian and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Iran for less than one month in August 1981. Bahonar and other members of Mohammad-Ali Rajai&#x27;s government were assassinated by Mujahideen-e Khalq.

== Early life ==
Mohammad Javad Bahonar was born on 3 September 1933 in Kerman, Iran. His father was a simple tradesman and had a little shop in the city of Kerman. He was the second child of nine, and his family was very poor. As a child, he was taught the Quran at the local Makk-tab-Khaneh (parochial school attended by the students very often at the house of local mullah before national school system was put in place) also learning to read and write in Persian. Guided by the Ayatollah Haghighi, he studied at the Masoumieh seminary. At the same time he could obtain the degree of fifth of ancient school.

== Education ==
Bahonar passed his primary school at Masoumieh School of Kerman. In 1953, he went to Qom Seminary and attended in the class of Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of Iranian revolution. He received a PhD in theology from the University of Tehran. Also, he was faculty member of the Tehran University and taught religious lessons and theology.

== Revolutionary activities ==
=== Before Iranian revolution ===
Bahonar was a reviler of the Pahlavi dynasty and had activities against Mohammad Reza Shah that led to his imprisonment in 1963, 1964, and 1975. On 1963, he was jailed for opposing the Shah&#x27;s White Revolution. Also, during the time of Khomeini&#x27;s exile to Iraq and France, he continued his revolutionary activities and was an influential member among Khomeini&#x27;s followers. Bahonar along with Morteza Motahari was active speaker of Hosseiniyeh Ershad, a religious lecture hall in the Tehran.

=== After Iranian revolution ===

Upon release from custody, Bahonar did not engage in further activism until Khomeini became Iran&#x27;s de facto ruler. For his service in the revolution, Bahonar became the new government&#x27;s minister of culture and Islamic guidance in 1981, and was responsible for censoring any media disapproved by Muslim leaders in Tehran. He also directed a purge of all secular influence from Iranian universities.

He became a founding member of the Islamic Republican party and an original member of the Council of Revolution of Iran. He was also a member of the Assembly of Experts. Bahonar along with Mohammad Ali Rajai purged Iranian universities of western cultural influences in what is known as the Islamic Cultural Revolution. After the assassination of Mohammad Beheshti on 28 June 1981, he was appointed general secretary of the party where he was also a member of the central committee. Bahonar served as the minister of culture and Islamic guidance under Mohammad Ali Rajai&#x27;s prime ministry from March 1981 to August 1981. When Rajai became president on 5 August 1981, he chose Bahonar as his prime minister.

== Assassination ==

Bahonar was assassinated along with Rajai and other members of the Islamic Republican Party when a bomb exploded at the party&#x27;s office in Tehran on 30 August 1981. In Iran, this explosion is known as the &quot;Hashteh-Shahrivar bombing&quot;. The bomb was set off when one of the victims opened a briefcase. The briefcase was carried by Massoud Keshmiri, a security official at the Islamic Republican Party, to the meeting. One week later, Keshmiri was announced as responsible for planning and executing the assassination. Keshmiri was identified as an operative of Mujahedin that was supported by Saddam Hussein. He tried to assassinate Rajai and Bahonar on 22 August when Rajai introduced his cabinet to Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad Khomeini explained that Keshmiri was with Rajai when they came to see Imam Khomeini. He had a suitcase but they did not allow him to bring it. He died at the age of 47.

Iranian authorities announced that Massoud Keshmiri, &quot;a close aide to the late President Muhammad Ali Rajai and secretary of the Supreme Security Council, had been responsible.&quot; Keshmiri, an MEK member who was thought to have died in the explosion, &quot;was accorded a martyr&#x27;s funeral&quot; and was &quot;buried alongside Rajai and Bahonar.&quot; Various MEK supporters were arrested and executed in reprisal, but Kashmiri apparently slipped through the dragnet. The reaction to both bombings was intense with many arrests and executions of MEK and other leftist groups.

<doc id="507988" wikidata="Q1473898" url="?curid=507988" title="USS Ticonderoga (CG-47)">
<text>USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; (DDG/CG-47), nicknamed &quot;Tico&quot;, was a guided missile cruiser built for the United States Navy. She was the lead ship of the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class and the first U.S. Navy combatant to incorporate the Aegis combat system. Originally ordered as a guided-missile destroyer, she was redesignated as a cruiser after capabilities from the cancelled Strike cruiser program were implemented into the ship&#x27;s design. The new AEGIS system allowed &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; to track and engage many aerial targets more effectively than any previous U.S. Navy warship.

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; entered service in 1983 and deployed later that year to the Mediterranean. Over her first 10 years of service, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; deployed multiple times to the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans and the Persian Gulf. During Operation Desert Storm, she was attached to Battle Force Zulu and served as Arabian Gulf Track Coordinator. Although she was built with a 35-year service life, the limited missile capacity of &quot;Ticonderoga&#x27;s&quot; twin Mark 26 missile launch systems rendered her obsolete by the end of the Cold War. As a result, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; adopted a primary mission of counternarcotics in the 1990s and 2000s, and made multiple patrols of the Caribbean in that role.

After being decommissioned in 2004, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was stored at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia. She arrived in Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping in 2020.

==Design and construction==

The contract to build DDG-47 &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding on 22 September 1978. The ship&#x27;s design was based on that of the &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer. While sharing the same hull, the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class design featured two large deckhouses and the Aegis combat system that together increased the ship&#x27;s displacement from the &quot;Spruance&quot;-class baseline of 6,900 tons to 9,600 tons. On each of the two deckhouses were two AN/SPY-1 radars that gave the ship 360° coverage of the surrounding airspace. Following the cancellation of the Strike Cruiser program, flagship capabilities were added to the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class&#x27;s design and the ship was then redesignated as a guided-missile cruiser, CG-47 on 1 January 1980, shortly before her keel was laid.

&quot;Ticonderoga&#x27;s&quot; keel was laid down on 21 January 1980, the 35th anniversary of the devastating kamikaze attack on the aircraft carrier . CG-47 was launched on 25 April 1981 and christening on 16 May 1981 with First Lady Nancy Reagan, the ship&#x27;s main sponsor, in attendance. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 13 December 1982 and commissioned in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 22 January 1983 with Captain Roland Guilbault in command.
===Naming===
CG-47 is the fifth United States Navy vessel to bear the name &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;. She was named for the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, the start of the American offensive during the American Revolution. The name &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; is derived from the Iroquois word &quot;tekontaró:ken&quot;, meaning &quot;it is at the junction of two waterways&quot;. Most of the ships in the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class are similarly named for significant battles in U.S. history.

==Service history==
===1980s===
Departing for her new homeport of Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, soon after her commissioning in Pascagoula, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; completed exercises in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. She arrived in Norfolk on 3 June 1983, and then deployed on 20 October to the Mediterranean with the Independence carrier strike group. Although stopping in Portsmouth, England, for a brief port visit, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was dispatched to the coast of Beirut following the bombing of U.S. Marine barracks on 23 October 1983. During her 48 days on station, she fired her five-inch guns at hostile artillery units attempting to shoot down two F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft performing a reconnaissance mission over Lebanon. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; made a port stop in Haifa, Israel, for the New Year and then returned to Norfolk, arriving on 4 May 1984.

On 8 September 1984, while &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was conducting exercises east of Mayport, Florida, a fire broke out in her aft main engine exhaust uptake. The At-Sea and General Quarters fire parties eventually put the fire out and &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; returned to Norfolk under her own power in early October.

On 23 March 1986, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, while conducting a Freedom of Navigation exercise in the Gulf of Sidra, moved south of the &quot;Line of Death&quot; in Libya, covered by fighter aircraft. Libya responded by unsuccessfully attacking battle-force aircraft. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; responded by destroying several Libyan patrol boats. For her participation in the operation, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; received her second Navy Unit Commendation and Navy Expeditionary Medal. During joint Navy-Air Force air strikes on Libyan targets on 15 April, she received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.

In the late 1980s, she served in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Earnest Will while under the command of Captain James M. Arrison III, USN.

===1990s===
For a time in the late 1990s, she was based at Pascagoula, Mississippi, as part of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic&#x27;s Western Hemisphere Group.

===2000s===
On 4 May 2004, she completed transit of the Panama Canal and then moved to cross the equator. Her ship crew engaged in the rites and rituals of the crossing, inducting the captain of the ship and many of the crew in to &quot;Shell-Backs&quot;. She completed her final deployment on 3 August 2004. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; then made liberty port visits to Cozumel, Mexico (15-17 March); Colon (27-28 March); Mayport (1-9 April); Guantánamo Bay (12-13 April); Cartagena, Colombia (27-29 May); Vasco Núñez de Balboa, Panama (6-7 May); and Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala (17-19 May). She conducted counter-narcotics operations in conjunction with Colombian military authorities from April–June. Ticonderoga successfully intercepted five cigarette-shaped “go-fast” smuggling boats, and one fishing vessel, netting over 14,000 pounds of cocaine, and detaining 25 suspects in the process.
She was decommissioned on 30 September of that year. After her decommissioning, she was towed to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia. In 2010, she was offered for museum donation by the Navy. An effort was made to bring &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; to Pascagoula, Mississippi, where she was built, to serve as a museum ship. In May 2013, the vessel was formally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, for disposal. In October of the same year, The Ticonderoga Historical Society reported that the US Navy was going to scrap the ship after a number of potential museum sites were unable to add her to their collections. In June 2014, NAVSEA released a disposal reporting letter declaring the ex-&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; to be available for inspection by bidders and ready for disposal by scrapping or sinking. In September 2020, she arrived at Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping.

<text>Karen Jane Allen (born October 5, 1951) is an American film, television and stage actress. She made her film debut in the comedy film &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978), which was soon followed by a small role in Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979) and a co-lead role in Philip Kaufman&#x27;s coming-of-age film &quot;The Wanderers&quot; (1979), before co-starring opposite Al Pacino in William Friedkin&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Cruising&quot; (1980).

Allen&#x27;s critical and commercial breakthrough came when she portrayed Marion Ravenwood opposite Harrison Ford in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), for which she won the Saturn Award for Best Actress. She later co-starred in &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; (1982), &quot;Starman&quot; (1984), for which she was again nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress, and &quot;Scrooged&quot; (1988). 

Allen has also received recognition for her work in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (1987), &quot;Year by the Sea&quot; (2016), and &quot;Colewell&quot; (2019). She reprised her role as Marion Ravenwood in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008) and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023). Her stage work has included performances on Broadway, and she has directed both stage and film productions.

==Early life==
Allen was born on October 5, 1951, in Carrollton, Illinois, to Ruth Patricia (née Howell) (1927–2020), a university professor, and Carroll Thompson Allen (1925–2015), an FBI agent. She is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent. Her father&#x27;s job forced the family to move often. &quot;I grew up moving almost every year and so I was always the new kid in school and always, in a way, was deprived of ever really having any lasting friendships&quot;, Allen said in 1987. Although Allen says her father was very much involved in the family, she felt that she and her two sisters grew up in a very female-dominated household.

After she graduated from DuVal High School, in Lanham, Maryland, at 17, she moved to New York City to study art and design at Fashion Institute of Technology for two years. Allen later ran a boutique on the University of Maryland campus and spent time traveling through South and Central Asia. She attended George Washington University and began to study and perform with the experimental company, the Washington Theatre Laboratory, in Washington, D.C. In 1974, Allen joined Shakespeare &amp; Company in Massachusetts. Three years later, she moved back to New York City and studied at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.

==Career==
Allen made her major film debut in 1978 in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. Her next two film appearances were in &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, in 1979, and &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot; in 1980, where she played one of three radical college students during the 1960s. She also appeared (as a guest star) in the 1979 pilot episode of the long-running CBS series &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. She had a small role as a television actor in Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), before being cast as the love interest of Al Pacino in William Friedkin&#x27;s controversial film &quot;Cruising&quot; (1980).
Allen&#x27;s career-changing role came with the blockbuster movie &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), directed by Steven Spielberg, in which she played Marion Ravenwood, the love interest of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford). Allen won the Saturn Award for Best Actress for her performance. After a few minor films, including leading roles in the dramatic thriller &quot;Split Image&quot; (1982), directed by Ted Kotcheff, and the Paris-set romantic drama &quot;Until September&quot; (1984), directed by Richard Marquand, as well as other stage appearances, she co-starred with Jeff Bridges in John Carpenter&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;Starman&quot; (1984). The film was a critical success, and later spawned the short-lived &quot;Starman&quot; television series in 1986. Allen&#x27;s performance in the film earned her another nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actress.

Allen debuted on Broadway in the 1982 production &quot;The Monday After The Miracle&quot;. In 1983, she played the lead in the off-Broadway play &quot;Extremities&quot;, a physically demanding role about a woman who turns the tables on a would-be rapist who attacks her. She often took breaks from movie roles to concentrate on stage acting; Allen appeared as Laura in the Paul Newman–directed film version of the Tennessee Williams play &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, with John Malkovich and Joanne Woodward, in 1987.

In 1988, Allen returned to the big screen as Bill Murray&#x27;s long-lost love, Claire, in the Christmas comedy &quot;Scrooged&quot;. While the film initially earned a mixed response from critics upon its release, it was a major box office success. In 1990, she portrayed the doomed crew member Christa McAuliffe in the television movie &quot;Challenger&quot;, based on the 1986 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. Subsequently, she appeared in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992), in a small supporting role in &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (2000) and &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; (2001). She made guest appearances on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1996) and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2001). She also starred in the short-lived series &quot;The Road Home&quot; (1994), and portrayed Dr. Clare Burton in the video game &quot;Ripper&quot; (1996). In 2014 she played the role of Betty Lowe in &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, the 13th episode of the 4th season of the CBS police procedural drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

Allen reprised her best-known role as Marion Ravenwood for the 2008 sequel &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, in which she renews her relationship with Indiana Jones and reveals to him that they have a son named Henry Jones III, who named himself Mutt Williams, played by Shia LaBeouf. The film was a critical and commercial success.

Allen starred in the American premiere of Jon Fosse&#x27;s &quot;A Summer Day&quot; at the Cherry Lane Theater in New York City, which opened in October 2012.

Allen has a long-standing relationship with the Berkshire Theater Group. It began in 1981, when she appeared in the play &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; at the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. She has also appeared in summer production of the nearby Williamstown Theater Festival. In August 2015, Allen directed Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot; for the Berkshire Theater Group. In 2016, Allen made her movie directing debut with the short film, &quot;A Tree. A Rock. A Cloud.&quot;, based on the short story by Carson McCullers. It won the Best International Short at the Manchester Film Festival in March 2017. Allen played the lead role in 2017&#x27;s &quot;Year by the Sea&quot;, a film based on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestselling memoir by Joan Anderson.

Allen reprised her role as Marion Ravenwood one last time in 2023&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;.

In 2024, she starred in &quot;Unsinkable: Titanic Untold&quot; as Nancy Smith, the wife of U.S. Senator William Alden Smith.

==Personal life==

In 1988, Allen married actor Kale Browne and had a son, Nicholas, in 1990. The couple divorced in 1998. Following the birth of her son, Allen accepted smaller roles in TV and films to concentrate on raising Nicholas. Nicholas went on to become a personal chef and win a &quot;Chopped&quot; competition on Food Network, which aired on December 22, 2016.

<text>Kim Jong Chul (; born 25 September 1981), sometimes spelled Kim Jong Chol, is a son of former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Il. His younger brother is current Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. His older half-brother Kim Jong-nam was assassinated in February 2017.

In 2007, Jong Chul was appointed deputy chief of a leadership division of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea. However, on 15 January 2009, the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported that Kim Jong Il appointed his youngest son, Jong-un, to be his successor, passing over Jong-nam and Jong-chul. These reports were supported in April 2009 when Kim Jong Un assumed a low-level position within the ruling Workers&#x27; Party since Kim Jong Il was groomed by his own father, Kim Il Sung, in a similar way before becoming North Korean leader in 1994.

==Early life==
Kim Jong Chul was born in 1981. He is the son of Kim Jong Il and companion Ko Yong Hui, who died in 2004. He was educated at the International School of Berne with younger brother Kim Jong Un.

==Heir apparent==
In February 2003, moves began to raise the profile of Kim Jong Chul. The Korean People&#x27;s Army began a propaganda campaign using the slogan &quot;The Respected Mother is the Most Faithful and Loyal Subject to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander&quot;. Since the &quot;Respected Mother&quot; was described as &quot;[devoting] herself to the personal safety of the comrade supreme commander&quot;, and &quot;[assisting] the comrade supreme commander nearest to his body&quot;, Western analysts assume that the &quot;Respected Mother&quot; was Ko Yong Hui, mother of Kim Jong Chul and Kim Jong Un. A similar campaign was launched in praise of Kim Jong Il&#x27;s mother (Kim Jong Suk) during the later years of Kim Il Sung&#x27;s life. This suggested that Kim Jong-chul, despite his youth, had emerged with Army backing to be a serious contender to succeed his father.

However, Kenji Fujimoto, Kim Jong Il&#x27;s personal sushi chef, wrote in his memoir, &quot;I Was Kim Jong-il&#x27;s Cook&quot;, that Kim Jong Il thought Jong Chul was &quot;no good because he is like a little girl&quot;. Fujimoto believed Kim Jong Il favoured his youngest son, Kim Jong Un.

On 1 June 2009, it was reported that Kim Jong Chul had been passed over as his younger brother, Kim Jong Un, was to succeed his father as the head of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and &quot;de facto&quot; head of state of North Korea.

==2011–present==
Kim Jong Chul was reportedly spotted in Singapore on 14 February 2011, where he was attending an Eric Clapton concert. In late 2011, his father died and his younger brother, Kim Jong Un, succeeded his father as the head of state. He was again apparently spotted attending two additional Clapton concerts on successive days at the Royal Albert Hall in London, in May 2015.

According to Lee Yun-keol (as reported by &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot;), chairman of the North Korea Strategy Information Service Center, Kim Jong Chul personally led the arrest of his uncle Jang Song-thaek in 2013. Some analysts believe that this signalled an expanded role for Kim Jong Chul in the North Korean regime.

Kim Jong Chul does not involve himself in politics, leading a quiet life in Pyongyang where he plays guitar in a band, according to Thae Yong-ho, North Korea&#x27;s former deputy ambassador in London who defected to the South.

<text>Camille Gutt (14 November 1884 – 7 June 1971), born Camille Guttenstein, was a Belgian economist, politician, and industrialist who served as the first managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 1946 to 1951. He was the architect of a monetary reform plan that facilitated the recovery of the economy of Belgium after the Second World War.

==Early life==
Born in Brussels, he was a son of Max Guttenstein and Marie-Paule Schweitzer. Max Guttenstein had moved to Belgium from Austria-Hungary in 1877 and became a Belgian citizen in 1886. Camille Gutt attended high school at the Royal Athenaeum in Ixelles. Gutt obtained a PhD in legal studies, and a master&#x27;s degree in political and social sciences at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). During his study, he met Claire Frick, whom he married in 1906. The marriage gave birth to three sons: Jean-Max (1914–1941), François (1916–1944) and Etienne (1922–2011). Gutt was Protestant, although from Jewish origin.

==Career==
Camille Gutt worked in various industries, such as in the Société Générale de Belgique and &quot;Groupe Empain&quot; as well as politics. During World War I, Gutt worked for Georges Theunis and again from 1920 until 1924 as his Chief of Cabinet. Later, Gutt also worked for Emile Francqui. Camille Gutt was Minister of Finance of Belgium in 1934–1935 and 1939–1940, Minister of Finance, Economics and Traffic in 1940–1942, Minister of Finance and economics in 1942–1943, and Minister of Finance in 1943–1944 in the Belgian government in exile in London.

Gutt was responsible for saving the Belgian franc before and after World War II. Before the war, he saved the Belgian currency by secretly transferring the gold reserves of the Belgian National Bank out of Nazi reach. After the war, he stabilized the Belgian franc and forestalled inflation, with what still is known as the &quot;&quot;. Camille Gutt also played a major role in forging the Benelux, and by this contributed to the formation of the European Union. He was the inaugural Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund from 1946 to 1951, after which he was a partner at the Banque Lambert until his retirement in 1964.

<doc id="508005" wikidata="Q117256753" url="?curid=508005" title="Dryas monkey">
<text>The Dryas monkey (Chlorocebus dryas), also known as Salonga monkey, ekele, or inoko, is a little-known species of Old World monkey found only in the Congo Basin, restricted to the left bank of the Congo River. It is now established that the animals that had been classified as &quot;Cercopithecus salongo&quot; (the common name being Zaire Diana monkey) were in fact Dryas monkeys. Some older sources treat the Dryas monkey as a subspecies of the Diana monkey and classify it as &quot;C. diana dryas&quot;, but it is geographically isolated from any known Diana monkey population.

While the Dryas monkey had been considered data deficient, evidence suggests it is very rare and its total population possibly numbers fewer than 200 individuals. Consequently, its status was changed to critically endangered in the 2008 IUCN Red List. Along with being listed by the IUCN, this species is also listed on Appendix II of CITES. However, in January 2019 the IUCN status was changed to endangered following the discovery of this species at eight locations in Lomami National Park.

== Taxonomy ==
While previously considered a member of the genus &quot;Cercopithecus&quot;, recent genetic studies indicates that it is instead a basal member of the &quot;Chlorocebus&quot; clade. However, it may potentially warrant its own genus.

== Physical description ==
An adult male Dryas monkey is characterized by its black muzzle, white whiskers, and short, white facial beard. The dorsal surface of its body, along with the coronal crown, is a grayish chestnut color. This species also has white on the ventral side of its body, tail, the bottom portion of the limbs, and the buttocks. The upper portion of the limbs resembles a similar color to the rest of its body, being a dark-grey/black-brown color.

Adult females and offspring have smaller portions of their bodies that are white in color; the white color is not present around their shoulder areas or their buttocks. Another difference in coloration is present in the upper portion of the arms, which are lighter in color as compared to the males. Body size varies from 40 to 55 cm, with a tail an additional 50–75 cm. Adults weigh between 4 and 7 kg, with marked sexual dimorphism.

== Ecology ==
This species prefers secondary forest locations. Although secondary forests are said to be preferred, these monkeys may also inhabit lowlands, rivers, or swampy areas of the Congo.

The diet of the Dryas is said to be made up of mostly plant foods, including fruits, young leaves, and flowers. Due to most of these foods being seasonal, this species also consumes small invertebrates, such as insects, as a supplement.

== Behaviour ==
This species is very social, and lives in groups that are either made up of their own species exclusively or within groups of mixed species. Visual and oral communication is very important, whether communicating to other Dryas monkeys or to other species. When living exclusively amongst each other, troops are made up of up to 30 individuals. Troops include many young offspring and females, but only contain one male. When females reproduce, they have only one young, and the gestation period lasts five months. Offspring are fully mature and ready to reproduce themselves after three years of life. The expected lifespan in the wild is 10–15 years, and because currently no Dryas monkeys are in captivity, that lifespan is unknown. 
Their movement occurs with a gait pattern involving all four limbs (quadrupedal).
As communication is very important to this species, they have a unique way of communicating with one another. An example is staring, which is a display used as a threat. The eyes stay fixed as the eyebrows rise and the scalp is retracted. The facial skin becomes stretched and the ears move back. These movements expose the eyelids, which are a different color and heavily contrasts with their facial color. Staring with open mouth is another threat expression that often goes along with head-bobbing. Head-bobbing, another threat display, is thought to be more aggressive. Presenting behavior is used by females during the mating season, showing males they are ready to mate.

== Conservation ==
The IUCN estimates only 200 individuals are left, although because the species is rarely spotted, an actual number is not known, leading this species to be listed as critically endangered. Few speculations are given as to why this species has declined so rapidly and is not showing much progress towards making a comeback. Some reasons include: poaching of the species for meat, habitat loss due to logging and other human activity, and the lack of information and knowledge of this species makes them more susceptible to dangers.

The community-managed Kokolopori Reserve in the north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo was initially considered a key to its survival and the only conservation efforts for the species. A second population, about from the first and partially protected by the Lomami National Park, was discovered in 2014.

<doc id="508012" wikidata="Q1785872" url="?curid=508012" title="Berry–Esseen theorem">
<text>In probability theory, the central limit theorem states that, under certain circumstances, the probability distribution of the scaled mean of a random sample converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases to infinity. Under stronger assumptions, the Berry–Esseen theorem, or Berry–Esseen inequality, gives a more quantitative result, because it also specifies the rate at which this convergence takes place by giving a bound on the maximal error of approximation between the normal distribution and the true distribution of the scaled sample mean. The approximation is measured by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance. In the case of independent samples, the convergence rate is , where is the sample size, and the constant is estimated in terms of the third absolute normalized moment. It is also possible to give non-uniform bounds which become more strict for more extreme events.

==Statement of the theorem==
Statements of the theorem vary, as it was independently discovered by two mathematicians, Andrew C. Berry (in 1941) and Carl-Gustav Esseen (1942), who then, along with other authors, refined it repeatedly over subsequent decades.

===Identically distributed summands===

One version, sacrificing generality somewhat for the sake of clarity, is the following:

:There exists a positive constant &quot;C&quot; such that if &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., are i.i.d. random variables with E(&quot;X&quot;1) = 0, E(&quot;X&quot;12) = &quot;σ&quot;2 &gt; 0, and E(|&quot;X&quot;1|3) = &quot;ρ&quot; &lt; ∞, and if we define
::formula_1
:the sample mean, with &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; the cumulative distribution function of
::formula_2
:and Φ the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, then for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;n&quot;,
::formula_3
That is: given a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each having mean zero and positive variance, if additionally the third absolute moment is finite, then the cumulative distribution functions of the standardized sample mean and the standard normal distribution differ (vertically, on a graph) by no more than the specified amount. Note that the approximation error for all &quot;n&quot; (and hence the limiting rate of convergence for indefinite &quot;n&quot; sufficiently large) is bounded by the order of &quot;n&quot;−1/2.

Calculated upper bounds on the constant &quot;C&quot; have decreased markedly over the years, from the original value of 7.59 by Esseen in 1942. The estimate &quot;C&quot; &lt; 0.4748 follows from the inequality
:formula_4
since &quot;σ&quot;3 ≤ &quot;ρ&quot; and 0.33554 · 1.415 &lt; 0.4748. However, if &quot;ρ&quot; ≥ 1.286&quot;σ&quot;3, then the estimate 
:formula_5
is even tighter.

 proved that the constant also satisfies the lower bound

===Non-identically distributed summands===

:Let &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., be independent random variables with E(&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;) = 0, E(&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;2) = &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;2 &gt; 0, and E(|&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;|3) = &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;i&quot; &lt; ∞. Also, let
::formula_7
:be the normalized &quot;n&quot;-th partial sum. Denote &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; the cdf of &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and Φ the cdf of the standard normal distribution. For the sake of convenience denote 
::formula_8
:In 1941, Andrew C. Berry proved that for all &quot;n&quot; there exists an absolute constant &quot;C&quot;1 such that
::formula_9
:where
::formula_10

:Independently, in 1942, Carl-Gustav Esseen proved that for all &quot;n&quot; there exists an absolute constant &quot;C&quot;0 such that
::formula_11
:where
::formula_12

It is easy to make sure that ψ0≤ψ1. Due to this circumstance inequality (3) is conventionally called the Berry–Esseen inequality, and the quantity ψ0 is called the Lyapunov fraction of the third order. Moreover, in the case where the summands &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; have identical distributions 
::formula_13
and thus the bounds stated by inequalities (1), (2) and (3) coincide apart from the constant.

Regarding &quot;C&quot;0, obviously, the lower bound established by remains valid:
: formula_14

The lower bound is exactly reached only for certain Bernoulli distributions (see for their explicit expressions).

The upper bounds for &quot;C&quot;0 were subsequently lowered from Esseen&#x27;s original estimate 7.59 to 0.5600.

===Sum of a random number of random variables===

Berry–Esseen theorems exist for the sum of a random number of random variables. The following is Theorem 1 from Korolev (1989), substituting in the constants from Remark 3. It is only a portion of the results that they established:

:Let formula_15 be independent, identically distributed random variables with formula_16, formula_17, formula_18. Let formula_19 be a non-negative integer-valued random variable, independent from formula_15. Let formula_21, and define
::formula_22
:Then
::formula_23

===Multidimensional version===
As with the multidimensional central limit theorem, there is a multidimensional version of the Berry–Esseen theorem.

:Let formula_24 be independent formula_25-valued random vectors each having mean zero. Write formula_26 and assume formula_27 is invertible. Let formula_28 be a formula_29-dimensional Gaussian with the same mean and covariance matrix as formula_30. Then for all convex sets formula_31,
::formula_32,
:where formula_33 is a universal constant and formula_34 (the third power of the L2 norm).

The dependency on formula_35 is conjectured to be optimal, but might not be.

== Non-uniform bounds ==
The bounds given above consider the maximal difference between the cdf&#x27;s. They are &#x27;uniform&#x27; in that they do not depend on formula_36 and quantify the uniform convergence formula_37. However, because formula_38 goes to zero for large formula_36 by general properties of cdf&#x27;s, these uniform bounds will be overestimating the difference for such arguments. This is despite the uniform bounds being sharp in general. It is therefore desirable to obtain upper bounds which depend on formula_36 and in this way become smaller for large formula_36. 

One such result going back to that was since improved multiple times is the following.

:As above, let &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., be independent random variables with E(&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;) = 0, E(&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;2) = &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;2 &gt; 0, and E(|&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;|3) = &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;i&quot; &lt; ∞. Also, let formula_42 and
::formula_43
:be the normalized &quot;n&quot;-th partial sum. Denote &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; the cdf of &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and Φ the cdf of the standard normal distribution. Then 
::formula_44,
:where formula_45 is a universal constant.

The constant formula_45 may be taken as 114.667. Moreover, if the formula_47 are identically distributed, it can be taken as formula_48, where formula_33 is the constant from the first theorem above, and hence 30.2211 works.

<text>Elisabeth Shue (born October 6, 1963) is an American actress. She has starred in the films &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; (1987), &quot;Cocktail&quot; (1988), &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989), &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; (1990), &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991), &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (1995), &quot;The Saint&quot; (1997), &quot;Hollow Man&quot; (2000), &quot;Piranha 3D&quot; (2010), &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; (2017), &quot;Death Wish&quot; (2018), and &quot;Greyhound&quot; (2020). For her performance in &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, she was nominated for the Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award for Best Actress.

On television, Shue played Julie Finlay in the CBS procedural forensics crime drama thriller &quot;&quot; (2012–2015) and Madelyn Stillwell in the Amazon Prime Video satirical superhero series &quot;The Boys&quot; (2019–2020), a role she reprises in the animated series &quot;The Boys Presents: Diabolical&quot; (2022) and the spin-off series &quot;Gen V&quot; (2023). She also leads the Netflix dramedy series &quot;On the Verge&quot; (2021).

==Early life and education==
Shue was born on October 6, 1963, in Wilmington, Delaware, the daughter of Anne Brewster (née Wells), and James William Shue, a one-time congressional candidate, lawyer, and real estate developer, who was president of the International Food and Beverage Corporation. Her mother was a vice president in the private banking division of the Chemical Bank Corporation. 

Shue grew up in South Orange, New Jersey. Her parents divorced when she was nine. Shue&#x27;s mother is a descendant of Pilgrim leader William Brewster while her father&#x27;s family emigrated from Germany to Pennsylvania in the early 19th century. Shue was raised with her three brothers (William, Andrew, and John) and was very close to them. Her younger brother, Andrew, is also an actor, best known for his role as Billy Campbell in the Fox series &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Shue graduated from Columbia High School, in 1981 in Maplewood, New Jersey, where she and Andrew were inducted into the school&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1994. Shue has two half-siblings from her father&#x27;s remarriage, Jenna and Harvey Shue.

After graduating from high school, Shue attended Wellesley College. She then transferred to Harvard University in 1985, from which she withdrew to pursue her acting career (she was inspired by a friend to work in television commercials as a way to pay for college) one semester short of earning her degree. Over a decade later, in 2000, Shue returned to Harvard and completed her B.A. in government.

==Career==

===1980s and early 1990s===
During her studies at Columbia High School and after her parents&#x27; divorce, Shue began acting in television commercials, becoming a common sight in advertisements for Burger King, also featuring future stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and Lea Thompson (whom Elisabeth would later co-star with in both television and film), DeBeers diamonds, Chewels bubble gum, and Best Foods/Hellmann&#x27;s mayonnaise. She had small parts, credited as &quot;Lisa Shue&quot;, in &quot;&quot; (1982) and &quot;Somewhere, Tomorrow&quot; (1983) which provided an early starring role for Sarah Jessica Parker.

Shue made her feature film debut in 1984, when she co-starred opposite Ralph Macchio in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; as Ali Mills, a high school cheerleader and the love interest of Macchio&#x27;s main character. Shue was a series regular as the teenage daughter of a military family in the short-lived television series &quot;Call to Glory&quot; between 1984 and 1985, which she followed in 1986 starring alongside Terence Stamp in the British horror film &quot;Link&quot;. In 1987 Shue appeared in the television movie &quot;Double Switch&quot; (part of the &quot;Disney Sunday Movie&quot; series), co-starring with George Newbern, who would go on to support her in her first star vehicle, the hugely popular &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;, in the same year.

In 1988, Shue starred in &quot;Cocktail&quot; as the love interest of Tom Cruise&#x27;s lead character. The following year, she starred in the short film &quot;Body Wars&quot;, which was used at Epcot in an ATLAS Simulator attraction in the Wonders of Life Pavilion until 2007. Other roles followed, including appearing as Jennifer Parker in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989) and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; (1990), where Shue replaced Claudia Wells who declined to reprise the role from &quot;Back to the Future&quot; due to her mother&#x27;s illness. It was around this time her older brother, William, died in an accident on a family holiday. Although her career was on the rise with her playing lead roles, Shue elected to take on the smaller supporting role of Jennifer in these sequels to allow her to deal with her family loss. The sequels were filmed back to back, and Shue featured prominently in Part II, appearing in bookend pieces in the third part of the trilogy.

Shue auditioned for the Ione Skye role in &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), being a runner-up along with Jennifer Connelly.
In May 1990, Shue made her Broadway debut in &quot;Some American Abroad&quot; at the Lincoln Center. The following year, Shue returned to cinema where she appeared in the comedies &quot;The Marrying Man&quot; with Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin, and &quot;Soapdish&quot; with Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr., Kevin Kline, Cathy Moriarty, and Whoopi Goldberg.

Between 1992 and 1994, Shue appeared in a variety of supporting roles in both film and television. These included the comedy &quot;Twenty Bucks&quot; (reuniting with Christopher Lloyd from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;), noir thriller &quot;The Underneath&quot;, a guest appearance in &quot;Dream On&quot;, and the romantic comedy &quot;Heart and Souls&quot; (reuniting with Robert Downey Jr.). She also returned to Broadway in 1993, performing in Tina Howe&#x27;s production of &quot;Birth and After Birth&quot;.

===1995–present===
Although often cast as a girl-next-door type, in a career-defining role Shue starred as a prostitute in the 1995 film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; with Nicolas Cage. The role earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Shue was also nominated for a BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG Award for Best Actress, and won Best Actress at the Independent Spirit Awards, Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards and the National Society of Film Critics Awards.

Shue&#x27;s career flourished after her Oscar nomination, landing her diverse roles. She starred in &quot;The Trigger Effect&quot; in 1996. Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1996) showcased her comedic abilities amongst heavyweight co-stars Billy Crystal, Demi Moore, Robin Williams and Stanley Tucci. Shue also displayed some action movie skills in the 1997 spy remake &quot;The Saint&quot; opposite Val Kilmer. The thriller &quot;Palmetto&quot; (1998) afforded her the chance to play a film noir-ish femme fatale opposite Woody Harrelson; Shue co-starred in &quot;Cousin Bette&quot; (1998) with Jessica Lange, and Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Hollow Man&quot; (2000) with Kevin Bacon proved another summer blockbuster.

In 1999, Shue starred as the titular &quot;Molly&quot; as an autistic young woman placed into the care of her unwilling bachelor brother, played by Aaron Eckhart. Shue played a mother that reveals her dark past to her teenaged daughter in the 2001 ABC movie &quot;Oprah Winfrey Presents: Amy and Isabelle&quot;. Shue has since stated she was &quot;extremely proud of that film, which no one ever saw, so it&#x27;s a good lesson that you do work for yourself and not necessarily for the end result&quot;.

Shue starred in &quot;Leo&quot; (2002) with Joseph Fiennes and Dennis Hopper, &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot; (2004) opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt, &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; (2005) opposite Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning, and &quot;Dreamer&quot; (2005) again opposite Dakota Fanning and Kurt Russell.

In 2007, Shue and her two brothers, Andrew and John, produced &quot;Gracie&quot;. Her husband, Davis Guggenheim, also produced and directed. Shue played the mother of the main character who was loosely based on her own experiences as the only girl on a boys&#x27; soccer team. Andrew also appeared as the soccer coach, and her previous co-star from &quot;The Trigger Effect&quot; Dermot Mulroney played the father of the main character. Andrew initially conceived of it as a story about their late brother William, the oldest Shue sibling, who was the captain of the high school soccer team; he died in a freak accident while the family was on a vacation in 1988. The older brother character of Johnny was based on Will. Shue also starred in the little seen &quot;First Born&quot; (2007) with British actor Steven Mackintosh.

In 2008, Shue starred in &quot;Hamlet 2&quot; as a fictionalized version of herself. In the film, she has quit acting to become a nurse and is the favorite actress of Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan). In 2009, Shue appeared on the seventh season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; as an actress competing with Cheryl Hines&#x27;s character for the part of George&#x27;s ex-wife for the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; reunion. That same year, she starred alongside Thomas Haden Church in &quot;Don McKay&quot;.

In 2010, Shue starred in &quot;Piranha 3D&quot; as Sheriff Julie Forester. She also played the former groupie mother of Abigail Breslin in &quot;Janie Jones&quot; and a psychologist in &quot;Waking Madison&quot; alongside Sarah Roemer and Imogen Poots.

In 2012, Shue appeared in three wide-release theatrical films: the thriller &quot;House at the End of the Street&quot; with Jennifer Lawrence; Curtis Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Mavericks&quot; opposite Gerard Butler; and David Frankel&#x27;s &quot;Hope Springs&quot; as Karen the bartender in a cameo scene with Meryl Streep.

The year 2012 also marked Shue&#x27;s return to television in a series regular role when she joined the cast of Season 12&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as Julie Finlay opposite Ted Danson, and replacing Marg Helgenberger. Finlay is the newest CSI, who just finished anger-management classes. Shue continued in the role until the end of Season 15 where her character&#x27;s fate was left hanging in the balance, later revealed in the two-part 2015 TV movie wrap-up finale of the entire series to have died (Shue did not appear). During her time on the series, being a massive tennis fan as well as regular tennis player, Shue jokingly suggested to the producers they have an episode centered around a murder at a tennis tournament. In Season 13, her wish was granted, and her friends and former pros-turned commentators, 18-time Grand Slam champion Chris Evert, three-time Grand Slam winner Lindsay Davenport and two-time mixed doubles Slam champ Justin Gimelstob appeared in an episode as themselves. Shue also re-united with &quot;Back to the Future&quot; alumna Lea Thompson, who guest starred in an episode of Season 14.

In 2014, Shue appeared as a cougar in &quot;Behaving Badly&quot; along with Selena Gomez, Nat Wolff and Heather Graham. In 2015, she guest-starred in an episode of the Patrick Stewart series &quot;Blunt Talk&quot;.

In 2017, Shue provided a strong supporting role in &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot;, opposite Steve Carell and Emma Stone. She had originally signed on as a tennis adviser for the film which recounts the 1973 showdown between female player Billie Jean King and former men&#x27;s champ Bobby Riggs.

In 2018, Shue co-starred in Eli Roth&#x27;s remake of &quot;Death Wish&quot; opposite Bruce Willis as his ill-fated wife. In the movie, she was also re-united with Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, who appeared in &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; with her.

In 2019, Shue took a leading role as Madelyn Stillwell in the American superhero drama television series, &quot;The Boys&quot;, with Karl Urban and Jack Quaid, and will be playing the lead role in the &quot;TNT&quot; television pilot &quot;Constance&quot;, playing a corrupt former beauty queen. In the latter, she will also be one of the executive producers along with Robert Downey Jr. (whom she previously co-starred with in &quot;Soapdish&quot; and &quot;Heart and Souls&quot;) and his wife Susan Downey among others. &quot;Constance&quot; is not going forward to series so remains to be seen if the pilot will air as a television movie.

Shue starred in &quot;Greyhound&quot; opposite Tom Hanks, released in 2020. That same year, she reprised her &quot;Karate Kid&quot; role as Ali Mills for a guest appearance in the sequel series, &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, alongside her original co-stars Ralph Macchio and William Zabka.

==Personal life==
Shue married film director Davis Guggenheim in 1994. Shue and Guggenheim have three children together. Shue gave birth to their first child, a son named Miles, on November 11, 1997. Their first daughter Stella followed on March 19, 2001. Their second daughter, third and final child, Agnes Charles, was born on July 2, 2006. In 2004, Shue and Guggenheim sold their Sunset Strip house for $1.3 million.

Rooth was born on 2 November 1888, in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of Otto Rooth and Ellen Hertzman. He graduated from Uppsala University with a Candidate of Law degree in 1911.

In Rooth&#x27;s early career, he was Solicitor for the Handelsbank (Commercial Bank) of Stockholm (1914), head of Bank&#x27;s Commercial Credit Department (1915), Assistant Manager and Solicitor of Stockholm Mortgage Bank, Governor of the Central Bank of Sweden (Sveriges Riksbank, 1929–1948), and Director of the Bank of International Settlements (1931–1933 and 1937–1949). In 1951, he headed a mission to Iraq for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. On 10 April 1951, he was appointed managing director and chairman of the executive board of the IMF and assumed his duties on 3 August 1951.

Rooth, in his first address to member countries as managing director of the IMF on 11 September 1951, stated that the Fund &quot;sought removal or modification of exchange restrictions and other discriminatory practices&quot; aimed at a freer flow of international trade and payments. Subsequently, general policy on use of IMF&#x27;s resources was set forth. This initiated the IMF&#x27;s policy of drawings in tranches. In 1952, in accordance with the Articles of Agreement, 5 years after the IMF began financial operations, annual consultations with members maintaining exchange restrictions under Article XIV were initiated. The IMF introduced a general framework for Stand-by Arrangements, and the criteria to be applied were standardized. Rooth&#x27;s term as managing director of the IMF ended on 27 April 1956, but he accepted a request by the executive board to serve a further period ending on 3 October 1956.

Rooth was head of the Investment Committee of the United Nations Pension Fund from 1947 to 1961, and he was also head of the Currency Board in Kuwait from 1960 to 1962. After 1962 he stepped down and lived at Lidingö, Sweden, and occasionally wrote and gave lectures on economic affairs.

==Personal life==
In 1914, he married Ingrid Lundgren (born 1889), the daughter of Bengt Lundgren and Eva Wennerström. In 1931, he married Ingrid Söderlindh (born 1899), the daughter of Gunnar Söderlindh and Gertrud Lindroth.

He had four children, including physician Gösta Rooth.

Rooth died in Sweden on 27 February 1972.

<text>A game reserve (also known as a game park) is a large area of land where wild animals are hunted in a controlled way for sport. If hunting is prohibited, a game reserve may be considered a nature reserve; however, the focus of a game reserve is specifically the animals (fauna), whereas a nature reserve is also, if not equally, concerned with all aspects of native biota of the area (plants, animals, fungi, etc.).

Many game reserves are located in Africa. Most are open to the public, and tourists commonly take sightseeing safaris. Historically, among the best-known hunting targets were the so-called Big Five game in Africa: rhinoceros (white rhinoceros as well as black rhinoceros), elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and lion, named so because of the difficulty and danger in hunting them.

In a game reserve, ecosystems are protected and conservation is usually key. Indigenous wildlife in its natural habitat help in providing an environment where growth in numbers at a natural rate can occur.

Some game reserves contain several ecosystems, ranging from valley bushveld, savannah grassland and fynbos to riverine forest and acacia woodland; this provides a dramatic improvement on the types of wildlife that are present and the numerous species of birds that thrive in these environments.

== Wildlife conservation ==

Wildlife conservation is a costly endeavor for most African countries. One of the more common forms of generating income to establish a sustainable economy to provide for wildlife conservation is known as wildlife viewing tourism. However, this attraction still does not generate enough to establish wildlife conservation. For regions that suffer political and economic instability, sustainable trophy hunting may be the only feasible source of sufficient income. Once established, another aspect to consider is the management of the land being used for hunting. Naturally, wildlife decreases with the increase of human presence which puts a strain on the quality of hunting. Generally, leases for hunting concessions are set up to last for multiple years all at once to encourage hunting operators to continue to manage the land for hunting; however, as the quality of hunting decreases, leases are shortened, causing an overall negative impact on the economy.

Many African countries benefit from community-based conservation. This concept explores the relationship between wildlife and people and the notion that conserving every animal is also not sustainable because certain animals threaten human lives and crops. One of the biggest arguments in support of community-based conservation is that allowing people to gain economic benefits from wildlife incentivizes conservation. One country that benefits from adopting this strategy is Zambia. The Zambian government established a wildlife conservation fund to act as the responsible player for redistributing funds from the hunting industry into wildlife conservation and community development.

== Ethical problems ==
Using game hunting as a conservation tool has negative perceptions that impose harsh restrictions across several countries in Africa. Activities that induce hunting bans include canned hunting, shooting young or uncommon animals, shooting from vehicles, and the use of bait, spotlights and hounds, all hunting practices that raise ethical problems.

<text>Per Jacobsson (5 February 1894 – 5 May 1963) was a Swedish economist who served as the first and longstanding chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements from 1931 to 1956, and as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 1956 until his death in 1963.

==Early life==

Per Jacobsson was born in Tanum, Bohuslän, in Sweden. His parents were Carl Julius Jacobsson, a veterinary surgeon, and Emma Kristina Jacobsson (maiden name Melander). His family moved to Vasteras, where he attended Rudbeckianska a secondary school founded in 1623. He then went to Uppsala University from 1912 to 1919. In his first term he studied economics, statistics and sociology, among other topics, but then in his second term switched to studying law. He received two law degrees from the university, in 1917 and 1919 respectively. However, he was able to undertake extensive studies in economics, mastering the subject. In 1914 he had an oral examination in economics given by David Davidson an economics professor. After that, Davidson told Per Jacobsson to consider succeeding him as an economics professor at the university. In the course of his studies, Per Jacobsson was highly influenced by Knut Wicksell. Over time at university he became more sociable. In 1917 he became president of the student club linked to his home town, Vastmanland-Dala Nation and in 1918 president of a student liberal political club, Verdandi.

Before he obtained his last degree, he spent a considerable amount of time in Stockholm. There he came into frequent contact with leading Swedish economists, joining an economics club started in 1917. Its senior members were Gustav Cassel, David Davidson, Knut Wicksell, and Eli Heckscher. He also had diverse work experiences, drawing on his knowledge of law and economics. He was variously: researcher for a commission on the post-war Swedish economy, assistant in the Court of Appeals, clerk at the Ministry of Finance, assistant teacher at the School of Forestry, and writer for various newspapers. In the latter role he wrote a review of a book by Gustav Cassell, who was Impressed by it. When Marcus Wallenburg Sr. asked Cassell to recommend a Swede to join the Secretariat of the League of Nations, he suggested Per Jacobsson. He was offered the post and accepted it.

== Work at the League of Nations ==
In April 1920 he became an international civil servant, by joining the League of Nations&#x27; Secretariat, and specifically what a few years later would be known as the Economic and Financial Organization. This had a Financial Committee for which he worked, eventually becoming its secretary. It took on assisting cities and countries in post-war economic difficulties, including high inflation. The committee developed a typical way of operating. Its staff would visit a capital, research the economic situation and write a report with recommendations. These generally included central government spending cuts and revenue increases and creating or strengthening an independent central bank to control issuance of the domestic currency. Loans could be organized to fund government deficits before agreed-to budgetary measures took full effect. Its work therefore was a precursor to International Monetary Fund country studies and conditional lending. Per Jacobsson participated in this process for the Free City of Danzig in 1921, and Austria and Hungary starting in 1922. The latter countries were lent £90 million in aggregate, which was repaid in 1926, and their government budgets became balanced in 1927.

Piet Clement, a financial historian, wrote that Per Jacobsson&#x27;s work for the committee &quot;left a deep imprint on his further career...because it taught him to quickly analyze a multitude of qualitative and quantitative data at an aggregated and comparative level, and to formulate conclusions and recommendations in a nevertheless pertinent and precise style.&quot;

While at the League, Per Jacobsson also worked on national arms spending data that would be comparable across countries. This was one element in the League&#x27;s efforts to limit spending on armaments and reduce the risk of a major armed conflict recurring. His work was published as a supplement to the Economist newspaper in October 1929. He continued his work on this after leaving the League as an outside expert, contributing to a report prepared for the World Disarmament Conference which first met in February 1932.

(After leaving the League, he returned to Sweden and worked from January 1929 to July 1930 at the Swedish Economic Defence Commission which was studying preparation for the eventuality of another war, and then from July 1930 to September 1931 as Economic Adviser to a Swedish industrial company, Kreuger and Toll.)

== Work at the Bank for International Settlements ==
He was employed at the Bank of International Settlements from 1931 to 1956.

== Work at the International Monetary Fund ==
In December 1956, he was appointed as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a position he held until his death on 5 May 1963.

== Personal life ==
He married Violet Nye, who was working for the League of Nations, in 1921. They had three daughters, Erin, Bridget and Moyra. Jacobsson&#x27;s daughter Moyra, an artist, married Roger Bannister, the British Olympic athlete and neurologist who was the first person to run the four-minute mile.

He was buried in the Swedish section of Brookwood Cemetery.

==Legacy==

The Per Jacobsson Foundation was established in 1964 to honor his memory and sponsors prestigious lectures, many of which have been given on the occasion of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington DC.

<text>Pierre-Paul Schweitzer (; 29 May 1912 – 2 January 1994) was a French businessman who served as the fourth managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 1963 to 1973.

==Early life and education==
He was born on 29 May 1912, in Straßburg, Elsaß-Lothringen, German Empire. He is the father of Louis Schweitzer, CEO of Renault. He was the nephew of Albert Schweitzer.

Schweitzer was educated at the University of Strasbourg, the University of Paris, and the Paris School of Political Science (Sciences Po) and received degrees in law, economics, and political science.

==Career==
In his early career, Schweitzer joined the French Government as an assistant Inspecteur des Finances (1936), before becoming an Inspecteur des Finances (1939). Then he was: deputy director for the department of external finance of the French Treasury (1946); alternate executive director for France at the IMF (1947); secretary of the French Interministerial Committee in Charge of Questions on European Economic Cooperation (1948); financial attaché at the French embassy in Washington (1949–1953); director of the French Treasury (1953–1960). In 1960, he was appointed deputy governor of the Bank of France. He also served as a director of the European Investment Bank, a director of Air France, and as a government commissioner on the boards of the French Petroleum Company and the French Refinery Company.

On 21 June 1963 Schweitzer was appointed managing director and chairman of the executive board of the IMF, and he assumed his duties on 1 September 1963. Schweitzer was appointed to a second five-year term as managing director and chairman of the board of the IMF on 15 May 1968.

Schweitzer&#x27;s term as the IMF&#x27;s managing director was a critical period, not only due to the collapse of the Par Value System, but also for the creation of the special drawing rights (SDR), as an international reserve asset (1968); the establishment of the two-tier gold market, and the work of the Committee of Twenty of the International Monetary System on reforming the international financial system. Also, during his tenure as managing director of the IMF, its membership grew from 91 to 125 countries.

Schweitzer received many honors and decorations, such as the Commander of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur; the Médaille de la Résistance, and the Croix de Guerre. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1972.

Schweitzer died on 2 January 1994 in Geneva, Switzerland.

==Military service==
Schweitzer was commissioned as a lieutenant in the French Army after the outbreak of World War II. When France fell in 1940, he joined the French Resistance and was later captured and held at the Buchenwald concentration camp, on the outskirts of Weimar, Germany, until it was liberated in 1945. Schweitzer was a Nazi concentration camp survivor.

<doc id="508028" wikidata="Q1325761" url="?curid=508028" title="USS Somers (1842)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Somers&quot; was a brig in the United States Navy during the administration of President John Tyler. It became infamous for being the only U.S. Navy ship to undergo a mutiny which led to executions.

&quot;Somers&quot; was launched at the New York Navy Yard on 16 April 1842 and commissioned on 12 May 1842, with Commander Alexander Slidell Mackenzie in command.

==Initial cruise==
After a shakedown cruise in June–July to the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico and back, the new brig sailed out of New York harbor on 13 September 1842 bound for the Atlantic coast of Africa with dispatches for frigate
. On this voyage, &quot;Somers&quot; was acting as an experimental schoolship for naval apprentices.

After calls at Madeira, Tenerife, and Praia, looking for &quot;Vandalia&quot;, &quot;Somers&quot; arrived at Monrovia, Liberia on 10 November and learned that the frigate had already sailed for home. The next day, Cdr. Mackenzie headed for the Virgin Islands hoping to meet &quot;Vandalia&quot; at St. Thomas before returning to New York.

==The &quot;&quot;Somers&quot; Affair&quot;==

On 25 November 1842, during passage to the West Indies, Midshipman Philip Spencer, the son of Secretary of War John C. Spencer, allegedly told purser&#x27;s steward J.W. Wales of a planned mutiny by approximately 20 members of &quot;Somers&quot; crew, who intended to use the ship for piracy from the Isle of Pines. Seaman Elisha Small was involved in the conversation, and Wales was threatened with death if he revealed Spencer&#x27;s plan.

On 26 November, Wales notified Captain Mackenzie of the plan through his chain of command via purser H.M. Heiskill and First Lieutenant Guert Gansevoort. Captain Mackenzie was not inclined to take the matter seriously, but instructed Lt. Gansevoort to watch Spencer and the crew for evidence of confirmation. Lt. Gansevoort learned from other crew members that Spencer had been observed in secret nightly conferences with seaman Small and Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Samuel Cromwell. Captain Mackenzie confronted Spencer with Wales&#x27; allegation that evening. Spencer replied that he told Wales the story as a joke. Spencer was arrested and put in irons on the quarterdeck. Papers written in Greek were discovered in a search of Spencer&#x27;s locker and translated by Midshipman Henry Rodgers: The papers read:

:&quot;CERTAIN: P. Spencer, E. Andrews, D. McKinley, Wales
:&quot;DOUBTFUL: Wilson (X), McKee (X), Warner, Green, Gedney, Van Veltzor, Sullivan, Godfrey, Gallia (X), Howard (X)
:&quot;Those doubtful marked (X) will probably be induced to join before the project is carried into execution. The remainder of the doubtful will probably join when the thing is done, if not, they must be forced. If any not marked down wish to join after the thing is done we will pick out the best and dispose of the rest.
:&quot;: Sibley, Van Brunt, Blackwell, Clarke, Corney, Garratrantz, Strummond, Witmore, Waltham, Nevilles, Dickinson, Riley, Scott, Crawley, Rodman, Selsor, The Doctor
:&quot;Wheel: McKee
:&quot;Cabin: Spencer, Small, Wilson
:&quot;Wardroom: Spencer
:&quot;Steerage: Spencer, Small, Wilson
:&quot;Arm Chest: McKinley&quot;

A mast failed and damaged some of the ship&#x27;s sail rigging on 27 November. The timing and circumstances were regarded as suspicious, and Cromwell, the largest man on the crew, was questioned about his alleged meetings with Spencer. Cromwell said: &quot;It was not me, sir – it was Small.&quot; Small was questioned and admitted meeting with Spencer. Both Cromwell and Small joined Spencer in irons on the quarterdeck.

On 28 November, wardroom steward Henry Waltham was flogged for having stolen brandy for Spencer, and, after the flogging, Captain Mackenzie informed the crew of a plot by Spencer to have them murdered. Waltham was flogged again on 29 November for suggesting theft of three bottles of wine to one of the apprentices. Sailmaker&#x27;s mate Charles A. Wilson was detected attempting to obtain a weapon that afternoon, and Landsman McKinley and Apprentice Green missed muster when their watch was called at midnight.

Four more men were put in irons on the morning of 30 November: Wilson, McKinley, Green, and Cromwell&#x27;s friend, Alexander McKie. Captain Mackenzie then addressed a letter to his four wardroom officers (First Lieutenant Gansevoort, Passed Assistant Surgeon L.W. Leecock, Purser Heiskill, and Acting Master M.C. Perry) and three oldest midshipmen (Henry Rodgers, Egbert Thompson, and Charles W. Hayes), asking their opinion as to the best course of action. The seven convened in the wardroom to interview members of the crew.

On 1 December, the officers reported that they had &quot;come to a cool, decided, and unanimous opinion&quot; that Spencer, Cromwell, and Small were &quot;guilty of a full and determined intention to commit a mutiny,&quot; and they recommended that the three be put to death, despite Spencer&#x27;s claim that the accused conspirators &quot;had been pretending piracy&quot;. The plotters were hanged that day and buried at sea. Some noted that Captain Mackenzie could have waited to take action since the ship was only thirteen days from reaching home port. In response, Mackenzie noted the fatigue of his officers, the ship&#x27;s small size, and the inadequacies of the confinement as reasons for moving forward with the executions.

&quot;Somers&quot; reached St. Thomas on 5 December and returned to New York on 14 December. She remained there during a naval court of inquiry that investigated the alleged mutiny and subsequent executions. The court exonerated Mackenzie, as did a subsequent court-martial that was held at his request to avoid a trial in civil court.

However, according to maritime historian Samuel Eliot Morison false accusations that Mackenzie was an incompetent martinet whose brutality brought on the mutiny continued to appear for years afterwards. Morison attributes the origin of the smear campaign to Whig politics, and a print vendetta by novelist James Fenimore Cooper, because Mackenzie and others had published articles criticizing Cooper&#x27;s history of the Battle of Lake Erie.

==In the Home Squadron==
On 20 March 1843, Lt. John West assumed command of &quot;Somers&quot; and the brig was assigned to the Home Squadron. For the next few years, she served along the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies.

==Mexican–American War==
&quot;Somers&quot; was in the Gulf of Mexico off Veracruz at the opening of the Mexican–American War in the spring of 1846, and, except for runs to Pensacola, Florida, for logistics, remained in that area on blockade duty until the winter. On the evening of 26 November, the brig, commanded by Lt. Raphael Semmes (later the celebrated commanding officer of the Confederate commerce raider CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;), was blockading Veracruz when the Mexican schooner &quot;Criolla&quot; slipped into that port. &quot;Somers&quot; launched a boat party that boarded and captured the schooner. However, a calm wind prevented the Americans from getting their prize out to sea, so they set fire to the vessel and returned through gunfire from the shore to &quot;Somers&quot;, bringing back seven prisoners. Unfortunately, &quot;Criolla&quot; proved to be a US spy ship operating for Commodore David Conner.
On 8 December 1846, while chasing a blockade runner off Veracruz, &quot;Somers&quot; capsized and foundered in a sudden squall. Thirty-six of her 80 crew were lost. Eight survivors were rescued by . Eight more swam to shore and were taken prisoner. English and French vessels rescued the other survivors. On 3 March 1847, Congress authorized gold and silver medals to the officers and men of French, British, and Spanish ships-of-war who aided in the rescue.

==Legacy and wreck==

Herman Melville – whose first cousin, Lt. Guert Gansevoort, was an officer aboard the brig at the time of the &quot;Somers&quot; Affair – may have been influenced by the notorious events involving the &quot;Somers&quot; mutineers. Melville may have used elements of the story in his novella &quot;Billy Budd&quot;.

The incident is detailed in the novel &quot;Voyage to the First of December&quot; by Henry Carlisle, written from the viewpoint of the naval surgeon on duty (from his old journals). It is also described in detail in the novel &quot;The Big Family&quot; by Vina Delmar.

The story of the &quot;Somers&quot; Affair and the subsequent trial is dramatized in the penultimate episode of the sixth season of the television series &quot;JAG&quot;. The presentation takes place as a dream by Lt. Col. Sarah MacKenzie, while she prepares to give a lecture at the United States Naval Academy, which came into existence as a result of the &quot;Somers&quot; Affair. The regular cast portrayed the people involved. Trevor Goddard played the role of Mackenzie, and Catherine Bell (in a play on the identical surname of her usual role in JAG) played Mrs. Mackenzie.

In 1986, an expedition led by George Belcher, an art dealer and explorer from San Francisco, California, discovered the wreck, and in 1987 archaeologists James Delgado and Mitchell Marken confirmed the identification of the wreck. In 1990, Delgado, along with Pilar Luna Erreguerena, co-directed a joint Mexican-US expedition, which involved archaeologists and divers from the US National Park Service, the Armada de Mexico, and the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. The project determined that unknown people had looted the wreck sometime after the 1987 expedition. The wreck remains as a site protected by legislation.

The most notable legacy of the &quot;Somers&quot; Affair is the US Naval Academy which was founded as a direct result of the affair. 
Appalled that a midshipman would consider mutiny, senior naval officials ordered the creation of the academy so that midshipmen could receive a formal and supervised education in naval seamanship and related matters.

<text>USS &quot;Somers&quot; (DD-301), a , engaged in peacetime operations with the Pacific Fleet from 1920 until she was scrapped under the London Naval Treaty in 1930. She was the fourth ship of the United States Navy named for Richard Somers.

==History==
&quot;Somers&quot; was laid down on 4 July 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; launched on 28 December 1918; sponsored by Miss Anna Maxwell Jayne; and commissioned on 23 June 1920.

&quot;Somers&quot; arrived at San Diego, California on 20 July 1920, and five days later sailed for the Puget Sound area and summer exercises with the Battle Fleet. She returned to San Diego on 4 August for war maneuvers off Coronado, California and on 3 October was attached to the Reserve Divisions at San Diego.

Resuming active status in March 1922, &quot;Somers&quot; underwent overhaul at Puget Sound and returned to San Diego on 8 July for tactical, torpedo, and gunnery exercises. Departing San Diego on 6 February 1923, she operated off Panama with the fleet between 26 February and 11 April, conducting exercises and participating in Fleet Problem I. She then proceeded to Puget Sound for her annual overhaul between 22 April and 28 June.

&quot;Somers&quot; remained in the north for summer exercises with the Battle Fleet and, on 25 July and 26 July, carried staff officers of President Warren G. Harding from Seattle, Washington to Vancouver, British Columbia, during the president&#x27;s Alaskan trip.

===Honda Point disaster and fleet problems===
On 27 August, she departed Puget Sound with her squadron for San Francisco and San Diego; but in a fog on 8 September, mistakes in navigation caused &quot;Somers&quot; and eight other ships of the squadron to run aground at Point Honda, in what is known as the Honda Point Disaster. &quot;Somers&quot; escaped disaster by conducting an emergency turn and, although she grazed a rock, she suffered only moderate damage to her bow. When the fog lifted the next morning, &quot;Somers&quot; discovered and aground on an offshore rock. Together with a passing fishing vessel, &quot;Bueno Amor de Roma&quot;, the destroyer rescued survivors. She arrived in San Diego on 10 September and received repairs at Mare Island from 31 October to 5 December.

On 2 January 1924, &quot;Somers&quot; departed San Diego with the Battle Fleet for the annual fleet concentration, transited the Panama Canal on 18 January, and participated in winter exercises and Fleet Problems II and III in the Caribbean until 31 March. Returning to San Diego in early April, she conducted summer exercises in the Puget Sound area from 2 July to 1 September; and, after a month in San Diego, returned to Puget Sound for overhaul from 25 November 1924 to 17 February 1925. Departing San Diego on 3 April 1925, &quot;Somers&quot; headed for Hawaii. She participated in Joint Army and Navy Problem 3 en route and arrived at Pearl Harbor with the fleet on 27 April. On 1 July, the Battle Fleet, including &quot;Somers&quot;, departed Pearl Harbor for a goodwill cruise to the Southwest Pacific and visited Melbourne, Australia; Dunedin and Wellington, New Zealand; and American Samoa, before returning to San Diego on 26 September.

&quot;Somers&quot; sailed on 1 February 1926 from San Diego for the annual fleet concentration off the Canal Zone which lasted until 20 March. On 14 June, she departed San Diego for summer exercises in the Puget Sound area, returning on 1 September. The annual overhaul at Puget Sound lasted from 7 December 1926 to 19 January 1927; and, on 17 February, she was again underway with the Battle Fleet for the fleet concentration. After completing exercises in the Caribbean on 22 April, the fleet made a visit to New York, conducted a joint Army and Navy exercise in Narragansett Bay, and then arrived at Hampton Roads on 29 May for the Presidential Naval Review there. Departing Hampton Roads on 4 June, the Battle Fleet, including &quot;Somers&quot;, called at San Diego from 25 June to 1 July and arrived in the Puget Sound area on 16 July for summer exercises.

===Final missions and fate===

&quot;Somers&quot; and her squadron left Puget Sound on 20 August and sailed to Hawaii, searching for planes lost on a flight from the United States to Honolulu. She returned to San Diego on 5 September and underwent overhaul at Puget Sound from 25 December 1927 to 29 February 1928. After a month at San Diego, she sailed on 9 April 1928 with the fleet for Hawaii to conduct Fleet Problem VIII. She returned to San Diego on 23 June and got underway six days later for summer exercises in Puget Sound including a reserve training cruise to Alaska from 7 to 21 July. Returning to San Diego on 4 September, she received repairs at Bremerton, Washington from 31 December 1928 to 8 February 1929; and, after spending the spring at San Diego, operated with the fleet off Puget Sound from 18 June to 28 August. On 25 September 1929 at San Diego, she towed the destroyer from the reserve fleet to her buoy.

On 10 April 1930, &quot;Somers&quot; was decommissioned and &quot;Buchanan&quot; was commissioned in her place. &quot;Somers&quot; was struck from the Navy list on 18 November 1930, scrapped at Mare Island in 1930 and 1931, and her materials were sold on 19 March 1931.

<text>USS &quot;Somers&quot; (DD-381) was a destroyer commissioned in the United States Navy from 1937 to 1945. She was the lead ship of the of destroyer leaders and was named for Richard Somers. During World War II, &quot;Somers&quot; was active in the South Atlantic, the North Atlantic, and the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.

==History==
&quot;Somers&quot; was laid down on 27 June 1935 at Federal, Kearny, New Jersey launched on 13 March 1937; co-sponsored by Miss Marie Somers and Miss Suzanne Somers; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 1 December 1937.

In 1938 she transported a consignment of gold from the Bank of England to New York. On 6 November 1941, she and the cruiser USS &quot;Omaha&quot; captured the German freighter &quot;Odenwald&quot; which was carrying 3800 tons of scarce rubber while disguised as the American merchantman &quot;Willmoto&quot;.

&quot;Odenwald&quot; was taken to Puerto Rico. An admiralty court ruled that since the ship was illegally claiming American registration, there were sufficient grounds for confiscation. A legal case was started claiming that the crews of the two American ships had salvage rights because the &quot;Odenwald&quot; crew&#x27;s attempt to scuttle the ship was the equivalent of abandoning her. The court case, settled in 1947 ruled the members of the boarding party and the prize crew were entitled to $3,000 apiece while all the other crewmen in Omaha and Somers were entitled to two months&#x27; pay and allowances. This was the last prize money awarded by the US Navy.

In November 1942 &quot;Somers&quot;, with and , intercepted another German blockade runner, the , near Brazil.

In January 1943 &quot;Somers&quot; and moved to Bathurst, Gambia in West Africa to support the Casablanca Conference between President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the Free French. At the end of the month &quot;Somers&quot; relocated to Dakar, Senegal and assisted in escorting the Free French warships &quot;Richelieu&quot; and &quot;Montcalm&quot; to the United States. By March &quot;Somers&quot; was based in Trinidad on patrols to Brazil as before. On 3 January 1944 &quot;Somers&quot; intercepted the German blockade runner &quot;Westerland&quot;, which scuttled itself. In May &quot;Somers&quot; escorted a convoy to England as part of the buildup for the Normandy invasion.

&quot;Somers&quot; next participated in the invasion of Normandy as a convoy escort and, in August, the Southern France invasion, providing naval gunfire support as well as serving in the anti-submarine screen. On 15 August 1944, four hours before H-Hour, D-Day, along the French Riviera, &quot;Somers&quot; encountered and sank the German corvette &quot;UJ6081&quot; and the sloop &quot;SG21&quot; at the Battle of Port Cros. Following this action, she moved inshore to give gunfire support to the invasion. For two days she bombarded enemy strongpoints off the coast near Toulon with 5 inch (127 mm) shells and then exchanged fire with enemy shore batteries east of Marseilles. &quot;Somers&quot; sustained some damage during this action.

For the next month, the destroyer operated in the Mediterranean Sea, visiting ports on the southern coast of France, Ajaccio, Corsica, and Oran, Algeria. She steamed out of Oran on 28 September and arrived in New York on 8 October. Somers was overhauled at the Brooklyn Navy Yard until 8 November, then moved to Casco Bay, Maine, for training. On 23 November, she joined the screen of a Britain bound convoy for the first of four transatlantic voyages which closed &quot;Somers&quot;&#x27; combat service. She returned to the United States on 12 May 1945 at the end of her last voyage to the United Kingdom. For the remainder of the war, &quot;Somers&quot; operated along the eastern seaboard and, in July, made one summer cruise to the Caribbean to train midshipmen.

==Fate==
On 4 August 1945, she put into Charleston, South Carolina, for overhaul and remained until 11 September. Instead of returning to active duty, &quot;Somers&quot; reported to the Commandant, 6th Naval District, for decommissioning and disposal. She decommissioned at Charleston on 28 October 1945 and was retained there until removed by her purchaser, Boston Metals of Baltimore, Md., on 16 May 1947. &quot;Somers&quot; was struck from the Navy list on 28 January 1947.

==Honors==
&quot;Somers&quot; earned two battle stars during World War II.

<text>Ketan Mehta (born 21 July 1952) is an Indian film director who has also directed documentaries and television serials since 1975.

==Early life and education==
Born on 21 July 1952 in Navsari in Gujarat, Mehta did his schooling from Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Delhi and later graduated in film direction from Film and Television Institute of India, Pune.

==Career==

During his career, Mehta has made ten feature films, seven documentaries and two television serials – &quot;Captain Vyom&quot; and &quot;Mr. Yogi&quot;. His repertoire of themes includes comedy, satire, romance, violence and rebellion.

After graduating from the Film and Television Institute of India, Mehta joined the Indian Space Research Organisation as a television producer. There, he was given almost total freedom in what to create. In an interview years later, Mehta remarked about how influential this was to his development: “It was an incredible experience. Traveling all over Gujarat, meeting people, making programs on whatever you felt like, whatever you came across. It was real, genuine experimentation with medium, with people. That experience has been vital to films that I’ve made.”

Mehta&#x27;s first film, &quot;Bhavni Bhavai&quot;, a Gujarati film, won him acclaim. His films have been selected for various international film festivals such as Nantes (France) and the Moscow Film Festival, where they have won numerous awards over the years. &quot;Mirch Masala&quot; was one of Mehta&#x27;s notable efforts, and won him the Best Film Award at Hawaii. It was released to 52 cinemas in the United States. Mehta has also had the honour of serving as a member of the jury in various national and international film festivals.

Mehta directed a biopic &quot;Sardar&quot;, on the life of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, in 1993.
His latest two films &quot;Rang Rasiya&quot;, 2014 and &quot;Manjhi the Mountain Man&quot;, 2015 both opened to tepid box office and universally positive critical reviews. &quot;Manjhi the Mountain Man&quot; starred Nawazuddin Siddiqui.

<doc id="508042" wikidata="Q1393142" url="?curid=508042" title="Fairey Aviation Company">
<text>The Fairey Aviation Company Limited was a British aircraft manufacturer of the first half of the 20th century based in Hayes in Middlesex and Heaton Chapel and RAF Ringway in Cheshire that designed important military aircraft, including the Fairey III family, the Swordfish, Firefly, and Gannet. It had a strong presence in the supply of naval aircraft, and also built bombers for the RAF.

After World War II the company diversified into mechanical engineering and boat-building. The aircraft manufacturing arm was taken over by Westland Aircraft in 1960. Following a series of mergers and takeovers, the principal successor businesses to the company became FBM Babcock Marine Ltd, Spectris plc, and WFEL (formerly Williams Fairey Engineering Limited), the latter manufacturing portable bridges.

==History==
Founded in 1915 by Charles Richard Fairey (later Sir Richard Fairey) and Belgian engineer Ernest Oscar Tips on their departure from Short Brothers, the company first built under licence or as subcontractor aircraft designed by other manufacturers. The first aircraft designed and built by the Fairey Aviation specifically for use on an aircraft carrier was the Fairey Campania a patrol seaplane that first flew in February 1917. In the third report of the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors, reported in &quot;Flight&quot; magazine of 15 January 1925, aviation figures prominently. C. R. Fairey and the Fairey Aviation Co. Ltd, was awarded £4,000 for work on the Hamble Baby seaplane.

Fairey subsequently designed many aircraft types and, after World War II, missiles.

The Propeller Division (Fairey-Reed Airscrews) was located at the Hayes factory, and used designs based on the patents of Sylvanus Albert Reed. C. R. Fairey first encountered Reed&#x27;s products in the mid-1920s when investigating the possibilities of the Curtiss D-12 engine. The Curtiss company also manufactured propellers designed by Reed. Another example of utilising the talents of independent designers was the use of flaps, designed by Robert Talbot Youngman (Fairey-Youngman flaps) which gave many of the Fairey aircraft and those of other manufacturers improved manoeuvrability.

Aircraft production was primarily at the factory in North Hyde Road, Hayes (Middlesex), with flight testing carried out at Northolt Aerodrome (1917–1929), Great West Aerodrome (1930–1944), Heston Airport (1944–1947), and finally at White Waltham (1947–1964). Losing the Great West Aerodrome in 1944 by requisition by the Air Ministry to build London Heathrow Airport, with no compensation until 1964, caused a severe financial shock which may have hastened the company&#x27;s end.

One notable Hayes-built aircraft type during the late 1930s and World War II was the Swordfish. In 1957, the prototype Fairey Rotodyne vertical takeoff airliner was built at Hayes. After the merger with Westland Helicopters, helicopters such as the Westland Wasp and Westland Scout were built at Hayes in the 1960s.
Receipt of large UK military contracts in the mid-1930s necessitated acquisition of a large factory in Heaton Chapel Stockport in 1935 that had been used as the National Aircraft Factory No. 2 during World War I. Flight test facilities were built at Manchester&#x27;s Ringway Airport, the first phase opening in June 1937. A few Hendon monoplane bombers built at Stockport were flown from Manchester&#x27;s Barton Aerodrome in 1936. Quantity production of Battle light bombers at Stockport/Ringway commenced in mid 1937. Large numbers of Fulmar fighters and Barracuda dive-bombers followed during World War II. Fairey&#x27;s also built 498 Bristol Beaufighter aircraft and over 660 Handley Page Halifax bombers in their northern facilities. Postwar, Firefly and Gannet naval aircraft were supplemented by sub-contracts from de Havilland for Vampire and Venom jet fighters. Aircraft production and modification at Stockport and Ringway ceased in 1960.
On 13 March 1959 &quot;Flight&quot; reported that Fairey Aviation Ltd was to be reorganised following a proposal to concentrate aircraft and allied manufacturing activities in the United Kingdom into a new wholly owned subsidiary called the Fairey Aviation Co. Ltd. The Board felt that the change, taking effect on 1 April 1959, would enable the Rotodyne and other aircraft work to be handled by a concern concentrating on aviation. It is proposed to change the company&#x27;s name to the Fairey Co. Ltd, and to concentrate general engineering activities in the Stockport Aviation Co. Ltd, whose name would become Fairey Engineering Ltd. Under these changes, the Fairey Co. would become a holding company, with control of policy and finance throughout the group.

The government in the late 1950s was determined to rationalise the UK&#x27;s aero industry. The Ministry of Defence saw the future of helicopters as being best met by a single manufacturer. The merger of Fairey&#x27;s aviation interests with Westland Aircraft took place in early 1960 shortly after Westland had acquired the Saunders-Roe group and the helicopter division of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Westland Aircraft and the Fairey Company announced that they had reached agreement for the sale by Fairey to Westland of the issued share capital of Fairey Aviation, which operated all Fairey&#x27;s UK aviation interests. Westland acquired all Fairey&#x27;s aircraft manufacturing business (including the Gannet AEW.3) and Fairey&#x27;s 10% investment in the Aircraft Manufacturing Company (Airco) Fairey&#x27;s workforce employed on manufacture of the outer wings of the Airco D.H.121. (later to be the HS 121 Trident) was transferred to Westland. Fairey received 2,000,000 Westland shares of 5 shillings each and a cash payment of approximately £1.4m. The sale did not include Fairey Air Surveys or the works at Heston which was home to the weapon division, which had a contract for research into advanced anti-tank missile systems. Fairey&#x27;s remaining net worth was approximately £9.5m.

===The collapse of the Fairey Group===

In 1977 the Fairey Group went into receivership and was effectively nationalised by the Government. Fairey went into liquidation when it introduced a Britten-Norman Islander production line into its subsidiary company, Avions Fairey, and overproduced the plane and subsequently faced redundancy payments of about £16 million in Belgium. The companies involved were as follows:
* Fairey Hydraulics Ltd, Heston, Hydraulic power controls and filters for aircraft; sold in 1999 to a management buyout, the name changed to Claverham Ltd, bought in 2001 by Hamilton Sundstrand.
* Fairey Engineering Ltd, Stockport, General, and nuclear engineering;
* Fairey Nuclear Ltd, Heston, Nuclear components and light engineering; see also Dungeness nuclear power station
* Fairey Industrial Products Ltd, Heston, Management company;
* Fairey Filtration Ltd, Heston, Industrial filters;
* Fairey Winches Ltd, Tavistock, Vehicle overdrives, winches, and hubs;
* Jerguson Tress Gauge and Valve Co Ltd, Newcastle, Liquid Level indicators;
* The Tress Engineering Co Ltd, Newcastle, Petrochemical valves;
* Fairey Marine Holdings Ltd, Hamble, Management company;
* Fairey Marine (East Cowes) Ltd, East Cowes, Ship, and boat building;
* Fairey Exhibitions Ltd, Hamble, Exhibition stand contractors;
* Fairey Marine Ltd, Hamble, Boatbuilding and repair;
* Fairey Yacht Harbours Ltd, Hamble, Boat handling, berthing, and storage;
* Fairey Surveys Ltd, Maidenhead, Aerial and geophysical survey and mapping;
* Fairey Surveys (Scotland) Ltd, Livingston, Aerial and geophysical survey and mapping;
* Fairey Developments Ltd, Heston, Management company:

The Fairey Britten-Norman Aircraft Company was taken over by Pilatus, then a subsidiary of the Oerlikon group in Switzerland.

The rescue action was taken by the Government under section 8 of the Industry Act 1972 acquiring from the official receiver of the Fairey Company Ltd the entire share capital for £201,163,000. The companies were managed by the National Enterprise Board (NEB). In 1980 The Fairey Group was purchased by Doulton &amp; Co. (part of S Pearson &amp; Son) from the NEB. At the time, Pearson&#x27;s interests in manufacturing were concentrated in the Doulton fine china business. The engineering interests were strengthened in 1980 by the acquisition of the high technology businesses of Fairey, and their merging with Pearson&#x27;s other engineering interests in 1982. However, these businesses were disposed of in 1986 as part of Pearson wishing to concentrate on core activities; acquired by Williams Holdings they became Williams Fairey Engineering Ltd and then WFEL Ltd.

Other parts of the combined Fairey – Doulton group saw a management buy-out from Pearson, listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1988. During the 1990s this company concentrated on expanding its electronics business, acquiring a number of companies, and disposing of the electrical insulator and hydraulic actuator businesses. In 1997, the company acquired Burnfield, of which Malvern Instruments was the most significant company. Servomex plc was acquired in 1999. In July 2000, the acquisition of the four instrumentation and controls businesses of Spectris AG of Germany for £171m was the largest ever made by the company and marked an important strategic addition to the company&#x27;s instrumentation and controls business. The reshaping of the group was marked with the change of name from Fairey Group to Spectris plc in May 2001.

== Subsidiary companies ==

===Avions Fairey===

On 27 August 1931, Avions Fairey SA was founded by Fairey engineer Ernest Oscar Tips. Fairey aircraft had impressed the Belgian authorities and a subsidiary, Avions Fairey was established to produce Fairey aircraft in Belgium
The company staff left Belgium ahead of the German invasion of the Low Countries and returned after the war to build aircraft under licence for the Belgian Air Force. With Fairey&#x27;s financial troubles in the later 1970s, the Belgian government bought Avions Fairey to preserve its involvement in the Belgian F-16 project. See also Tipsy Nipper.

===Fairey Aviation of Canada===
Formed in 1948 the Fairey Aviation Company of Canada Limited and grew from a six-man operation to a major enterprise employing around a thousand people. In March 1949, the company undertook repair and overhaul work for the Royal Canadian Navy on the Supermarine Seafire and the Fairey Firefly and later the Hawker Sea Fury and also undertook modification work on the Grumman Avenger. The Avro Lancaster conversion programme created the need for plant expansion. The Lancaster was followed in service by the Lockheed Neptune and again the company undertook a share of the repair overhaul and service of these aircraft. The company was engaged in the modification and overhaul of the McDonnell Banshee.

Fairey of Canada also developed a component and instrument design and manufacturing organisation. The company began manufacture of Hydro Booster Units which control flight surfaces hydraulically rather than manually. Other flight controls were designed and manufactured for the Avro CF-100. The Canadair Argus used Fairey-designed hydraulic actuators. The company also produced the &quot;Bear Trap&quot; helicopter /ship handling system for the Royal Canadian Navy. In the early 1960s the company undertook the conversion of the Martin Mars flying boats to water-bearing firefighters.

Drawing on the parent company&#x27;s expertise in the design of hydraulic equipment led to local manufacturer of the Fairey Microfilter, which had applications in industries beyond aviation. Yet another Fairey designed and manufactured component was the Safety Ohmmeter. This instrument had many applications in missiles, mining, quarrying and similar fields. The company was appointed agent for RFD Inflatable Marine Survival Equipment. This agency included sales, service inspection and repair of inflatable liferafts.

The West Coast Branch of the Fairey Aviation Company of Canada Limited was formed in 1955 at Sidney, Vancouver Island. The plant was located at Patricia Bay Airport. This facility handled mainly repair, overhaul and modification of military and civil aircraft including the conversion of ex-military Avenger aircraft to commercial cropdusting roles. Additionally, the company diversified into designing and manufacturing items of hospital equipment.

Following the failure of the UK parent, Fairey Canada was acquired by IMP Group International.

===Fairey Aviation Company of Australasia===
The Australian branch of Fairey Aviation was formed in 1948 as Fairey-Clyde Aviation Co Pty. Ltd, a joint venture with Clyde Engineering and incorporated the aircraft division of CEC. The name was changed in November 1951. Based in Bankstown, Sydney, the factory overhauled aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy, converted RAN Firefly AS.5s to Trainer Mark 5 standard. The Special Projects Division built the Jindivik, Meteor, and Canberra drones at Woomera missile test range. Fairey Australasia was the first company to be established at the Weapons Research Establishment (WRE). This was in 1949 when the firm was involved in supporting research trials of the scale model of the Fairey vertical-take-off aircraft. Shortly afterwards the company expanded to manufacture the RTV.l research rockets that were fired in Australia. From this developed a design and production factory that specialised in the manufacture of airborne and ground equipment for target aircraft and missile fields including the Tonic towed target, which can be carried and streamed by a Jindivik 3A.

In 1957 a miniature camera by the name of WRECISS (Weapons Research Establishment camera interception single-shot) was designed and developed by the WRE at Woomera and manufactured by the Fairey Aviation Co of Australasia, at Salisbury, South Australia. In most surface-to-air missile installations the cameras have been mounted in the nose telemetry bay. Although the firing lever must be replaced after each mission, it is estimated that some 30 per cent of the WRECISS can be re-used without repairs and a substantial further proportion can be repaired relatively cheaply. Its film was Ilford Photo SR101 in the form of 0.93in discs punched from 35 mm strip; weight 801; diameter 1.5in; length 1.25in; field of view 186 deg; exposure time 0.3 millisecond; effective relative aperture, approximately f/8. One hundred and ninety-two cameras were made in the initial production run. In 1988 this company was merged into AWA Defence Industries of Australia.

===Aerial Survey===

Fairey Air Surveys, Ltd, was initially headquartered at 24 Bruton Street, London W1. and later at Reform Road, Maidenhead, with companies across the world. The aircraft (Douglas Dakotas) and technical offices were based at White Waltham, Berks, along with a special research laboratory. Here the company undertook the design and development of anti-vibration isolators which were incorporated into camera mountings. Both mapping and geophysical work was undertaken. The UK based aircraft were sent out to work all over the world. The company undertook aerial surveys for local authorities within the UK and for many overseas Governments. Maps were also published under the Fairey-Falcon imprint. Over the years the companies names were changed to reflect Fairey ownership and operated into the late 1970s, later becoming Clyde Surveying Services Ltd. Fairey Surveys was absorbed into what eventually became Blom Aerofilms.
Subsidiary companies were as follows:—
* Fairey Surveys (Scotland), Livingston, Aerial and geophysical survey and mapping.
* Aero Surveys, Vancouver International Airport, Canada. This company was equipped to handle processing and mapping. Aircraft included two Ansons and one P-38. Operated in partnership with Fairchild Aerial Surveys, Inc.
* Air Survey Company of India, Dum Dum Airport, Calcutta. This branch was fully equipped for processing and mapping. Aircraft included a DC-3 and three DH Rapides (known in 1946 as the Indian Air Survey &amp; Transport Limited).
* Air Survey Company of Pakistan, Dunolly Road, Karachi, 2. This was an office only and no aircraft or ground equipment were permanently based there.
* Air Survey Company of Rhodesia, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. Fully equipped for processing and mapping. An Anson or a Dove from the UK fleet was available for operations.
Other companies were located in Nigeria, Zambia and the Republic of Ireland.

==Engineering==
===Heaton Chapel===
The Fairey factory at Heaton Chapel, Stockport can trace its roots back to when Crossley Bros. Ltd having had by the end of 1916 supplied large numbers of tenders and aero engines to the Royal Flying Corps acquired premises at High Lane, Heaton Chapel to expand production. In 1917, following the Government&#x27;s decision to build three National Aircraft Factories was taken, Crossley Motors Ltd was formed to manage National Aircraft Factory No.2 as it was known. The factory continued to produce aircraft until November 1918. After the First World War the site switched to vehicle production. The factory was taken over by Willys-Knight and Overland Motors for the manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles and retained by them until 30 November 1934 when it was acquired by Fairey. In 1935 the Fairey company received a substantial order for Hendon night bombers and established production lines at the Heaton Chapel factory. The production facilities at Heaton Chapel were incorporated as the Stockport Aviation Company Limited on 11 February 1936 and the Company took a site at Ringway (now Manchester Airport), where test flights were carried out.

After the end of aircraft production the Heaton Chapel works became Fairey Engineering Ltd and began production of medium and heavy engineering including portable bridges for military and emergency services use, notably the Medium Girder Bridge. Its bridges are in service with the British Army, U.S. Army and many other NATO forces. Fairey Engineering Ltd also made Nuclear Reactor cores and fuelling machines for Dungeness B and Trawsfynydd.

The company became Williams Fairey Engineering in 1986, and was then taken over by the Kidde portion of the American United Technologies Corporation. in 2000, and became now known as WFEL Ltd. In 2006 the Manchester Evening News reported that private equity investors Dunedin Capital Partners backed a management buy-out of WFEL from UTC which employs 160 people at its factory on Crossley Road, Heaton Chapel.

===Land Rover hubs and overdrives===

In the post-war period, from the late 1950s onwards, Fairey acquired Mayflower Automotive Products, including their factory in Tavistock, Devon, and with it the designs of its products, including winch and free-wheeling front hubs for Land Rover vehicles. By the 1970s Fairey was manufacturing a wide range of winches, covering mechanical, hydraulic and electric drive and capstan/drum configurations. Fairey winches formed the bulk of the manufacturer-approved winch options for Land Rover throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1975 Fairey designed and manufactured a mechanical overdrive unit for Land Rovers. Vehicles fitted with the unit carried a badge on the rear saying &quot;Overdrive by Fairey&quot;, with the Fairey logo (see above).

This branch of products effectively ceased in the early 1980s when new product development at Land Rover and a trend for manufacturers to build accessories in-house forced Fairey to drop out of the sector. The American company Superwinch bought the Tavistock works and continued making Fairey-designed winches for a few years. The site was Superwinch&#x27;s European base and manufacturing facility until its closure in 2019, when the US parent company ceased operations and the key assets were sold to the Westin company in San Dimas, California.

* Fairey Monarch – 2 x 12 cylinders (two engines with one propshaft passing through the other) 2,250 hp. The P-24 flew in 1939 but was cancelled during the war.

==Missiles and drones==
Fairey&#x27;s interest in missile production had been kept separate from the Fairey Aviation Co Ltd and its subsequent absorption into the Westland Group in 1960. Production was therefore invested in Fairey Engineering Ltd but by 1962 this had been transformed into a 50/50 joint venture with the British Aircraft Corporation (Holdings) Ltd known as BAC (AT) LTD, with offices at 100 Pall Mall, London SW1 and a share capital of £100. This was separate to the BAC Guided Weapons division.

The Fairey company was also involved in the early development of pilotless aircraft which led to the development of radio controlled pilotless target aircraft in Britain and the United States in the 1930s. In 1931, the Fairey &quot;Queen&quot; radio-controlled target was developed, building a batch of three. The Queen was a modified Fairey IIIF floatplane, (a catapult launched aircraft which was used for reconnaissance by the Royal Navy). Apart from installing radio gear the Queen also had some aerodynamic modifications to improve stability, however the first couple of pilotless flights came to quick endings as the drones crashed as soon as they left the catapult launcher on HMS &quot;Valiant&quot;.

In 1960, Fairey announced an agreement between Fairey Engineering Ltd and the Del Mar Engineering Laboratories, Los Angeles, California, to distribute a range of subsonic and supersonic towed target systems (RADOP) for air-to-air and surface-to-air guided weapon training in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, the Commonwealth and the UK.

The parent Fairey Company and its Australian subsidiary were heavily involved guided weapon development. The Weapon Division of Fairey Engineering Ltd was responsible in the UK for the Jindivik Mk 2B Pilotless target aircraft. This had a Bristol Siddeley Viper ASV.8 turbojet, giving a speed of and an operational ceiling in excess of 50,000 ft.

The &quot;Fairey V.T.O&quot; was a vertical take-off delta wing aircraft was designed to explore the possibility of making an aircraft launched from short ramps with low acceleration. Shown for the first time at the Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) Show in 1952, the Fairey VTO Project was used to test the basic configuration of future research craft. Each wing had a large aileron and the vertical fin carried a large rudder. The V.T.O. obtained thrust from each Beta nozzle and, for launching, used two solid-fuel boosters of each, bringing the total thrust up to —obviously more than the total weight. The Beta I rocket had two jets, one of which could be swivelled laterally and the other vertically, according to signals from an autopilot. The resulting mean thrust line could thus be varied to maintain controlled flight at low airspeeds. Fairey carried out many successful tests, the first of which was from a ship in Cardigan Bay in 1949.

Fairey Rocket Test Vehicle 1, formerly known as LOPGAP (&quot;Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-Aircraft Projectile&quot;). The original design can be traced back to the 1944 Royal Navy specification for a guided anti-aircraft missile known as LOPGAP. In 1947, the Royal Aircraft Establishment took over development work and the missile was renamed RTV1. Several versions of the basic RTV1 were developed.

The Fairey Aviation Company of Australasia Pty Ltd was awarded a contract to build 40 RTV1e rockets. The first of which were completed in early 1954. Components were built by the Royal Australian Navy Torpedo Establishment (hydraulic servo units), EMI (guidance receivers and amplifiers) and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (magnesium castings). Some parts were also imported from the UK. Assembly was undertaken at Salisbury, South Australia by the Special Projects Division of Fairey. Test firings took place in 1955–56 but by this time the RTV1 was considered obsolete RTV1e was the beam guidance test vehicle. Radar guidance was provided by a radar unit which projected a narrow beam. Different versions of the test vehicle were created and each was concerned with a different aspect of control, guidance, propulsion and aerodynamics of the complete rocket. The RTV 1e was a two-stage liquid fuel rocket used for research and development into problems associated with beam riding missiles. It was fired at an angle of 35 degrees with a maximum altitude of about 12,000 feet. The vehicle was launched by seven solid booster rockets which had a burn time of four seconds, after which the liquid fuel sustainer motor took over.

At the 1954 Farnborough Airshow, Fairey Australia displayed a massive missile resembling the RTV-1. The base was formed by a booster unit about 6 ft high and 20 inches in diameter, stabilised by four large and four small fins and housing seven five-inch motors. The main body was about 17 ft in length with a diameter of 10 in. The body was fitted with four wings and four small control vanes.

Fairey Australia also displayed an aerodynamic test vehicle, described as a &quot;three-inch winged round&quot;. This was a simple projectile, without guidance, to aid investigations into the properties of various wing/body assemblies at high supersonic speeds. The example shown was about 6 ft long, and had a finely finished, white-painted body apparently made of seamless tube. About two-thirds of the way back from the nose was fitted a laminated-wood wing of about two feet span, positioned across a diameter of the body, with a root chord of some 18 inches and a quarter-chord sweep of about 50 degrees.

In April 1947 Fairey released details of its first guided missile It was an anti-aircraft weapon designed for use in the Pacific War but not completed in time for use by the British Army (who originally ordered it) or for the Royal Navy. The Ministry of Supply requested that the work be completed, and the Stooge was the outcome. It had a length of , a span of , a body diameter of 17 in, and weighing , with a warhead. Propulsion was by four -thrust solid-fuel main rockets, but initially four additional booster rockets delivering further 5,600 lb thrust accelerated the Stooge off its long launching ramp. Unlike later designs, the Stooge was intended for high subsonic speeds—and limited ranges. The Stooge consisted of two-stage propulsion, an autopilot, radio control equipment with additional ground unit, and a warhead. The Stooge required a launching ramp and transport. The missile was extensively tested at Woomera

The Malkara missile was designed in Australia by British and Australian companies. It was a heavy wire-guided missile for deployment from vehicles, light naval craft and fixed emplacements. This weapon replaced the Fairey &quot;Orange William&quot; project for the MoS which would later lead to Swingfire. Fairey Engineering had the sales agency for all countries outside the US, and was also appointed by the Australian Department of Supply&#x27;s to assist in the introduction of the Malkara to operational service and to design and produce modifications. The missile was in service with the Royal Armoured Corps, deployed on a special vehicle—the Humber Hornet, made by Wharton Engineering—which carried two rounds on launchers and two rounds stowed. The Hornet could be air-dropped, had a crew of three. For training purposes the Malkara Mk I was used, with a range of some 2,000 m (6,600 ft). The operational weapon was the Malkara Mk 1 A, which had a different type of tracking flare, thinner guidance wire, and other improvements to give approximately double the range of Mk 1.

The Fairey Fireflash was an early air-to-air weapon guided by radar beam riding. Developed as &quot;Blue Sky&quot; – a derated version of the Red Hawk missile. It was in service briefly before being replaced by the de Havilland Firestreak.

Green Cheese was a tactical nuclear anti-ship missile for use with the Gannet. Problems with Gannet led to continued development with the Blackburn Buccaneer but it was cancelled.

==Fairey Marine==

Fairey Marine Ltd was begun in the late 1940s by Sir Richard Fairey and Fairey Aviation&#x27;s Managing Director, Mr Chichester-Smith. Both were avid sailing enthusiasts. Utilising techniques developed in the aircraft industry during WWII both men decided that they should produce sailing dinghies and so recruited Charles Currey to help run the company when he came out of the Navy. In the following years, thousands of dinghies were produced by Fairey Marine including the Firefly, Albacore, Falcon, Swordfish, Jollyboat, Flying Fifteen, 505 and International 14&#x27;s along with the much smaller Dinky and Duckling. Later on in the 1950s they produced the larger sailing cruisers, the Atalanta (named after Sir Richard&#x27;s first son&#x27;s wife), Titania, Fulmar and the Fisherman motor sailer (based on the Fairey Lifeboat hull) along with the 15 Cinderella (outboard runabout) and the 16&#x27;6&quot; Faun (outboard powered family cruiser).

==Fairey Band==
In 1937, workers at the Fairey aviation plant formed a brass band. For some sixty years the band was associated with the company and its successors, although the Fairey Band has now had to turn to external sources for financial backing. Throughout its history though the band has retained its identity with the company under guises as the &quot;Fairey Aviation Works Band&quot;, &quot;Williams Fairey Band&quot; and later &quot;Fairey (FP Music) Band&quot;. The band has recently returned to roots, rebranding as just &quot;The Fairey Band&quot;. The Fairey Band has won many national and international titles throughout its proud history.

<text>Frenzy is a 1972 British thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It is the penultimate feature film of his extensive career. The screenplay by Anthony Shaffer was based on the 1966 novel &quot;Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square&quot; by Arthur La Bern. The film stars Jon Finch, Alec McCowen and Barry Foster and features Billie Whitelaw, Anna Massey, Barbara Leigh-Hunt, Bernard Cribbins and Vivien Merchant. The original music score was composed by Ron Goodwin.

The plot centres on a serial killer in contemporary London and the ex-RAF serviceman he implicates. In a very early scene there is dialogue that mentions two actual London serial murder cases: the Christie murders in the 1940s-1950s and the Jack the Ripper murders in 1888. 

&quot;Frenzy&quot; was the third and final film that Hitchcock made in Britain after he moved to Hollywood in 1939. The other two were &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; in 1949 and &quot;Stage Fright&quot; in 1950. (There were some interior and exterior scenes filmed in London for the 1956 remake of &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;.) The last film he made in Britain before his move to the United States was &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939). &quot;Frenzy&quot; was the only Hitchcock film given an R rating during its initial release. &quot;Frenzy&quot; was screened at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, but it was not entered into the main competition. Some critics – such as Raymond Foery, author of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Frenzy: The Last Masterpiece&quot; – consider &quot;Frenzy&quot; the last great Hitchcock film, and a return to form after his two previous works: &quot;Topaz&quot; and &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;.

==Plot==
Former RAF squadron leader Richard Blaney is fired from his job as a barman in a pub near Covent Garden. He laments his loss with his friend Bob Rusk, who runs a fruit and vegetable stall in Covent Garden. Rusk consoles him and gives a tip on a forthcoming horse-race, but Blaney has no money to bet. He visits his ex-wife Brenda, who runs a successful matchmaking agency, and complains loudly about his situation. They briefly argue, but she invites him to dinner. Broke, Blaney ends up spending the night at a Salvation Army shelter, where he discovers that Brenda has slipped money into his coat pocket.

On the following day, Rusk, whom the agency has turned away because of his creepy sexual proclivities, arrives at Brenda&#x27;s office. Finding her alone, he rapes her, then strangles her with his necktie, revealing that he is the serial killer whom the newspapers have dubbed the &quot;Necktie Murderer&quot;. After Rusk leaves, Blaney arrives, hoping to talk to Brenda again, but he finds her office locked. Brenda&#x27;s secretary, returning from lunch, sees Blaney leaving. When the murder is discovered, Blaney becomes the prime suspect.

Blaney meets up with Babs Milligan, his former pub co-worker, and convinces her that he is innocent. The two stay at a hotel, where they make love, then narrowly dodge the police. They appeal to one of Blaney&#x27;s RAF buddies for help, but the man&#x27;s wife refuses to harbour a fugitive. Blaney persuades Babs to fetch his belongings from the pub, so he can flee. While there, Babs runs into Rusk, who offers to let her use his flat for the night. After taking Babs there, he rapes and murders her. He hides her body in a sack and, late that night, stows it in the back of a lorry hauling potatoes. Back in his room, Rusk discovers that his distinctive jewelled tie pin (with the initial R) is missing, and realises that Babs must have torn it off while he was strangling her. Knowing the tie pin will incriminate him, Rusk goes to retrieve it, but the lorry starts off on its journey while he is still inside. In spite of the bumpy ride, he retrieves the pin that is still clutched in Babs&#x27;s hand. Dishevelled and covered in potato-dust, he gets out at a roadside café, then returns to his Covent Garden flat. When Babs&#x27;s body is discovered, Blaney is suspected of her murder as well as Brenda&#x27;s.

Blaney, unaware that Rusk is the actual murderer, turns to him for help. Rusk offers to hide Blaney at his flat and then tips off the police. In the face of this treachery, Blaney realises that Rusk must be the murderer. At the trial, the jury finds Blaney guilty. During the trial and while being led away to prison, Blaney loudly protests that he is innocent and that Rusk is the real killer. Chief Inspector Oxford reconsiders the evidence and quietly investigates Rusk. He discusses the case with his wife while trying to avoid eating the unappetising food she has learned to prepare in an &quot;exotic cooking&quot; course.

Blaney, now in prison, vows to escape and avenge himself on Rusk. He deliberately injures himself and is taken to the hospital, where his fellow inmate patients help him escape. He goes to Rusk&#x27;s flat; Rusk is not there, but Blaney, thinking that Rusk is sleeping, hits that person on the head. It is revealed that that was not Rusk but a woman already dead in Rusk&#x27;s bed, strangled with Rusk&#x27;s necktie. Inspector Oxford, who has anticipated that Blaney would go after Rusk, arrives to find Blaney with the dead woman. Just as Blaney begins to protest his innocence, the two hear a loud banging noise coming from the stairwell. Rusk enters, dragging a large trunk into the flat, and is confronted by Blaney and Oxford. Realising that his game is well and truly up, Rusk drops the trunk in defeat.

Cast notes
* Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo appearance can be seen three minutes into the film in the centre of a crowd scene, wearing a bowler hat. Teaser trailers show a Hitchcock-like dummy floating in the River Thames and Hitchcock introducing the audience to Covent Garden via the fourth wall.
* Michael Caine was Hitchcock&#x27;s first choice for the role of Rusk, the main antagonist, but as Caine later said, &quot;He offered me the part of a sadist who murdered women and I won&#x27;t play that. I have a sort of moral thing and I refused to play it and he never spoke to me again.&quot;
* Barry Foster was cast after Hitchcock saw him in &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; (which featured &quot;Frenzy&quot; co-star Billie Whitelaw).
* Vanessa Redgrave reportedly turned down the role of Brenda, and &quot;Deep Red&quot;″s David Hemmings (who had co-starred with Redgrave in &quot;Blowup&quot;) was considered to play Blaney.
* Helen Mirren, who later in life played Hitchcock&#x27;s wife Alma Reville in &quot;Hitchcock&quot;, met with the director to discuss the role of Babs Milligan. &quot;I didn&#x27;t like Hitchcock very much,&quot; Mirren said years later, &quot;and he didn&#x27;t like me very much either ... I didn&#x27;t really want to be in the movie.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
After a pair of unsuccessful films depicting political intrigue and espionage, Hitchcock returned to the murder genre with this film. The narrative makes use of the familiar Hitchcock theme of an innocent man overwhelmed by circumstantial evidence and wrongly assumed to be guilty. 
Hitchcock announced the project in March 1968.

Hitchcock approached Vladimir Nabokov to write the script, but the author turned him down because he was busy on a book. He then hired Anthony Shaffer.

&quot;It will be done comedically&quot;, said Hitchcock.

The film starred relative newcomers in the lead roles. &quot;I prefer a fresh face&quot;, he said.

Barry Foster has said that, in order to prepare for his role, he was asked by Hitchcock to study two books about Neville Heath, an English double murderer who would often pass himself off as an officer in the RAF.

===Shooting===
Filming began in July 1971.

Hitchcock shot &quot;Frenzy&quot; in London after many years making films in the United States. The film opens with a sweeping shot along the Thames to Tower Bridge; and while the interior scenes were filmed at Pinewood Studios, much of the location filming was done in and around Covent Garden and was an homage to the London of Hitchcock&#x27;s childhood. The son of a Covent Garden merchant himself, Hitchcock filmed several key scenes showing the area as the working produce market it was. Aware that the area&#x27;s days as a market were numbered, Hitchcock wanted to record the area as he remembered it. According to the &#x27;making-of&#x27; feature on the DVD, an elderly man who remembered Hitchcock&#x27;s father as a dealer in the vegetable market came to visit the set during the filming and was treated to lunch by the director.

No. 31, Ennismore Gardens Mews, was used as the home of Brenda Margaret Blaney during the filming of &quot;Frenzy&quot;.

During shooting for the film, Hitchcock&#x27;s wife and long-time collaborator Alma had a stroke. As a result, some sequences were shot without Hitchcock on the set so he could tend to his wife.

The film was the first Hitchcock film to have nudity (with the arguable exception of the shower scene in &quot;Psycho&quot;). The nude scenes used body doubles in place of Barbara Leigh-Hunt and Anna Massey. The nude scene which shows the first victim being raped and strangled was called by Donald Spoto &quot;one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film&quot;. There are a number of classic Hitchcock set pieces in the film, particularly the long tracking shot down the stairs when Babs is murdered. The camera moves down the stairs, out of the doorway (with a rather clever edit just after the camera exits the door which marks where the scene moves from the studio to the location footage) and across the street, where the usual activity in the market district goes on with patrons unaware that a murder is occurring in the building. A second sequence set in the back of a delivery truck full of potatoes increases the suspense, as the murderer Rusk attempts to retrieve his tie pin from the corpse of Babs. Rusk struggles with the hand and has to break the fingers of the corpse in order to retrieve his tie pin and try to escape unseen from the truck.

The part of London shown in the film still exists more or less intact, but the fruit and vegetable market no longer operates from that site, having relocated in 1974. The buildings seen in the film are now occupied by banks and legal offices, restaurants and nightclubs, such as Henrietta Street, where Rusk lived (and Babs met her untimely demise). Oxford Street, which had the back alley (Dryden Chambers, now demolished) leading to Brenda Blaney&#x27;s matrimonial agency, is the busiest shopping area in Britain. Nell of Old Drury, which is the public house where the doctor and solicitor had their frank, plot-assisting discussion on sex killers, is still a thriving bar. The lanes where merchants and workers once carried their produce, as seen in the film, are now occupied by tourists and street performers.

In a 29 May 1972 letter to the editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, novelist La Bern said he found Hitchcock&#x27;s production and Shaffer&#x27;s adaptation of his book &quot;appalling&quot;, concluding: &quot;Finally, I wish to dissociate myself with Mr Shaffer&#x27;s grotesque misrepresentation of Scotland Yard offices.&quot;

===Soundtrack===
Henry Mancini was originally hired as the film&#x27;s composer. &quot;If the same film was made ten years ago it would&#x27;ve had twice the amount of music in it&quot;, he said.

His opening theme was written in Bachian organ andante, opening in D minor, for organ and an orchestra of strings and brass, and was intended to express the formality of the grey London landmarks, but Hitchcock thought it sounded too much like Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s scores. According to Mancini, &quot;Hitchcock came to the recording session, listened awhile and said: &#x27;Look, if I want Herrmann, I&#x27;d ask for Herrmann. After an enigmatic, behind-the-scenes melodrama, the composer was fired. He never understood the experience, insisting that his score sounded nothing like Herrmann&#x27;s work. Mancini had to pay all transportation and accommodation costs himself. In his autobiography, Mancini reports that the discussions between himself and Hitchcock seemed clear, and he thought he understood what was wanted; but he was replaced and flew back home to Hollywood. The irony was that Mancini was being second-guessed for being too dark and symphonic after having been criticised for being too light before. Mancini&#x27;s experience with &quot;Frenzy&quot; was a painful topic for the composer for years to come.

Hitchcock then hired composer Ron Goodwin to write the score after being impressed with some of his earlier work. He had Goodwin rescore the opening titles in the style of a London travelogue - the director had heard his score for the Peter Sellers sketch &quot;Balham, Gateway to the South&quot;. Goodwin&#x27;s music had a lighter tone in the opening scenes, and scenes featuring London scenery, while there were darker undertones in certain other scenes.

In 2023, Quartet Records issued a soundtrack album featuring both the Goodwin score and the unused Mancini score.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Frenzy&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Vincent Canby of the &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a passionately entertaining film&quot; with &quot;a marvelously funny script&quot; and a &quot;superb&quot; cast. He put it on his year-end list of the ten best films of 1972. &quot;Variety&quot; also posted a rave review, declaring: &quot;Ingeniously fresh story-telling ideas, stamped with the same mischievous, audacious and often outrageous mixture of humor and suspense that first made him and later sustained him, make the Universal release one of Hitchcock&#x27;s major achievements.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film his highest grade of four stars, calling it &quot;a return to old forms by the master of suspense, whose newer forms have pleased movie critics but not his public. This is the kind of thriller Hitchcock was making in the 1940s, filled with macabre details, incongruous humor, and the desperation of a man convicted of a crime he didn&#x27;t commit.&quot; Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote of Hitchcock that &quot;we are nearly back in the days of his great English films&quot;, adding &quot;He is lucky to have been able to draw on Anthony Shaffer to do &quot;Frenzy&quot;″s sly screenplay, not to speak of a cast of first-rate, well-equated actors pretty much unknown outside England, so that audiences have no preconceptions about who are the stars and therefore unkillable.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s best picture in years&quot;, with &quot;all the marks of work by a master at his craft and at his most assured&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; printed a very positive review of the film: &quot;In case there was any doubt, back in the dim days of &quot;Marnie&quot; and &quot;Topaz&quot;, Hitchcock is still in fine form. &quot;Frenzy&quot; is the dazzling proof. It is not at the level of his greatest work, but it is smooth and shrewd and dexterous, a reminder that anyone who makes a suspense film is still an apprentice to this old master.&quot; In its 2012 review, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;Frenzy&quot; a &quot;complex and gripping thriller&quot; praising the film as &quot;a rich tapestry of suspense, and a masterpiece&quot;.

Some reviews were more mixed. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has a promising opening sequence and a witty curtain line, but the material in between is decidedly pedestrian. The reviewers who&#x27;ve been hailing &quot;Frenzy&quot; as a new classic and the triumphant return of the master of suspense are, to put it kindly, exaggerating the occasion ... If this picture had been made by anyone else, it would be described, justly, as a mildly diverting attempt to imitate Hitchcock.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was unsure what to make of the picture, noting an &quot;old-fashioned air&quot; to it that seemed to suggest that Hitchcock&#x27;s return to England &quot;signalled a regression to an almost pre-war style of filmmaking&quot;. It concluded: &quot;For all its apparent awkwardness of script and characterisation (Jon Finch especially can make little of Shaffer&#x27;s anemically written hero) there is enough in &quot;Frenzy&quot; to suggest that, after the routine critical dismissals, it will repay serious assessment.&quot;

&quot;Frenzy&quot; ranked 14th on &quot;Variety&quot;″s list of the Big Rental Films of 1972, with rentals of $6.3 million in the United States and Canada.

The film was the subject of the 2012 book &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Frenzy: The Last Masterpiece&quot; by Raymond Foery. &quot;Frenzy&quot; holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Marking Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s return to England and first foray into viscerally explicit carnage, &quot;Frenzy&quot; finds the master of horror regaining his grip on the audience&#x27;s pulse -- and making their blood run cold.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

<text>Stephen K. Hayes (born September 9, 1949) is an American martial artist and writer.

==Early life==
Stephen K. Hayes was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and raised in Dayton, Ohio. He graduated from Fairmont West High School in Kettering, Ohio, in 1967.

Hayes attended Miami University in nearby Oxford, Ohio, because he &quot;heard they had a judo club&quot;. It turned out to be a Korean Tang Soo Do school, not judo, but Hayes remained. In 1971, he graduated from Miami with a Bachelor of Arts degree, having majored in speech and theatre.

==Martial arts career==
In the 1970s, Hayes traveled to Japan. In June 1975, he met and began training under Tsunehisa Tanemura. He later trained under Masaaki Hatsumi, who refers to himself as 34th Grandmaster of Togakure-ryū ninjutsu and is the founder of the Bujinkan (武神館) organization.

Hayes returned to the United States with his wife, Rumiko, in late 1980 when his Japan residency visa expired, and began teaching and authoring numerous books and magazine articles.

In 1985, he was entered into the &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame as Instructor of the Year. He was again featured on the cover of &quot;Black Belt&quot; in the March 2007 issue. The magazine&#x27;s opening editorial described him as &quot;one of the 10 most influential living martial artists in the world&quot;.

In 1993, Hayes was awarded the &quot;judan&quot; (tenth-degree black belt) in Togakure-ryū ninjutsu from Hatsumi.

In 1997, he founded the martial art of To-Shin Do, an art based in his experience of &quot;budō taijutsu&quot;.

In 2006, Hayes&#x27;s name was removed from the display of active Bujinkan teachers, ending his official role within that organization. That his name plank was removed from the Bujinkan Honbu wall has been documented by both parties. However, the specifics regarding the motivation for the removal are in dispute. Some suggest Hayes was expelled from the organization. Hayes explains that he simply no longer participates as an active Bujinkan instructor. To-Shin Do is taught through his SKH (Stephen K. Hayes) Quest locations. The SKH Quest network now spans 31 schools across North America, Europe, Australia and Africa.

Hayes acted in the 1980 television miniseries &quot;Shogun&quot; and in 2004 was featured in the Discovery Channel documentary &quot;Unsolved History&quot; regarding ninja and their practices.

==Buddhism==
Hayes is an ordained practitioner of esoteric Tendai Mikkyō Buddhism. He apprenticed under Dr. Clark Jikai Choffy, an ordained Tendai priest and personal disciple of Jion Haba, the bishop of Tokyo&#x27;s Reisho-in temple. He received empowerments and teachings from Choffy, received transmission in the Homan Ryu school of Tendai esoteric Buddhism, and in 1991 he received Tokudo priesthood ordination in Tendai Buddhism. Hayes has founded a Buddhist Order based on his teachings and experiences with Tibetan Buddhism and Tendai, called the Blue Lotus Assembly.

While traveling through Tibet, Hayes met the Dalai Lama in 1987. During a conference in the United States when the Dalai Lama learned that he had received the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize Hayes assisted with the unexpected security concerns as reporters arrived. For many years in the 1990s, Hayes served as the Dalai Lama&#x27;s personal protection escort and security adviser, especially during visits to the United States.

==Personal life==
Hayes resides and works in Dayton, Ohio. He and his wife, Rumiko Hayes, have two daughters, Reina and Marissa.

<doc id="508057" wikidata="Q937228" url="?curid=508057" title="Property (philosophy)">
<text>In logic and philosophy (especially metaphysics), a property is a characteristic of an object; for example, a red object is said to have the property of redness. The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it may be instantiated, and often in more than one object. It differs from the logical and mathematical concept of class by not having any concept of extensionality, and from the philosophical concept of class in that a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it. Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of the problem of universals.

==Terms and usage==
A property is any member of a class of entities that are capable of being attributed to objects. Terms similar to &quot;property&quot; include &quot;predicable&quot;, &quot;attribute&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, &quot;feature&quot;, &quot;characteristic&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;exemplifiable&quot;, &quot;predicate&quot;, and &quot;intensional entity&quot;.

Generally speaking, an object is said to &quot;exemplify&quot;, &quot;instantiate&quot;, &quot;bear&quot;, &quot;have&quot; or &quot;possess&quot; a property if the property can be truly predicated of the object. The collection of objects that possess a property is called the &quot;extension&quot; of the property. Properties are said to &quot;characterize&quot; or &quot;inhere in&quot; objects that possess them. Followers of Alexius Meinong assert the existence of two kinds of predication: existent objects &quot;exemplify&quot; properties, while nonexistent objects are said to &quot;exemplify&quot;, &quot;satisfy&quot;, &quot;immanently contain&quot; or &quot;be consubstantiated by&quot; properties that are &quot;actually&quot; possessed and are said to &quot;encode&quot;, &quot;be determined by&quot;, &quot;be consociated with&quot; or &quot;be constituted by&quot; properties that are &quot;merely&quot; ascribed to objects. For example, since Pegasus is merely mythical, Pegasus encodes the property of being a horse, but Pegasus exemplifies the property of being a character of Greek mythology as well. Edward Jonathan Lowe even treated &quot;instantiation&quot;, &quot;characterization&quot; and &quot;exemplification&quot; as three separate kinds of predication.

Broadly construed, examples of properties include redness, the property of being two, the property of being nonexistent, the property of being identical to Socrates, the property of being a desk, the property of being a property, the property of being both round and square, and the property of being heterological. Some philosophers refuse to treat existence as a property, and Peter van Inwagen suggested that one should deny the existence of certain &quot;properties&quot; so as to avoid paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s paradox and Grelling–Nelson paradox, though such moves remain controversial.

==Metaphysical debates==
In modern analytic philosophy there are several debates about the fundamental nature of properties. These center around questions such as: Are properties universals or particulars? Are properties real? Are they categorical or dispositional? Are properties physical or mental?

===Universals vs. particulars===
At least since Plato, properties are viewed by numerous philosophers as universals, which are typically capable of being instantiated by different objects. Philosophers opposing this view regard properties as particulars, namely tropes.

===Realism vs. anti-realism===
A realist about properties asserts that properties have genuine, mind-independent existence. One way to spell this out is in terms of exact, repeatable, instantiations known as universals. The other realist position asserts that properties are particulars (tropes), which are unique instantiations in individual objects that merely resemble one another to various degrees. Transcendent realism, proposed by Plato and favored by Bertrand Russell, asserts that properties exist even if uninstantiated. Immanent realism, defended by Aristotle and David Malet Armstrong, contends that properties exist only if instantiated.

The anti-realist position, often referred to as nominalism claims that properties are names we attach to particulars. The properties themselves have no existence.

===Categoricalism vs. dispositionalism===
Properties are often classified as either &quot;categorical&quot; and &quot;dispositional&quot;. Categorical properties concern what something is like, e.g. what qualities it has. Dispositional properties, on the other hand, involve what powers something has, what it is able to do, even if it is not actually doing it. For example, the shape of a sugar cube is a categorical property while its tendency to dissolve in water is a dispositional property. For many properties there is a lack of consensus as to how they should be classified, for example, whether colors are categorical or dispositional properties.

According to categoricalism, dispositions reduce to causal bases. On this view, the fragility of a wine glass, a dispositional property, is not a fundamental feature of the glass since it can be explained in terms of the categorical property of the glass&#x27;s micro-structural composition. Dispositionalism, on the other hand, asserts that a property is nothing more than a set of causal powers. Fragility, according to this view, identifies a real property of the glass (e.g. to shatter when dropped on a sufficiently hard surface). Several intermediary positions exist. The Identity view states that properties are both categorical (qualitative) and dispositional; these are just two ways of viewing the same property. One hybrid view claims that some properties are categorical and some are dispositional. A second hybrid view claims that properties have both a categorical (qualitative) and dispositional part, but that these are distinct ontological parts.

===Physicalism, idealism, and property dualism===

 Property dualism describes a category of positions in the philosophy of mind which hold that, although the world is constituted of just one kind of substance—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: physical properties and mental properties. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical substances (namely brains).

This stands in contrast to physicalism and idealism. Physicalism claims that all properties, include mental properties, ultimately reduce to, or supervene on, physical properties. Metaphysical idealism, by contrast, claims that &quot;something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality.&quot;

==Types==
===Intrinsic and extrinsic===

An intrinsic property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context. An extrinsic (or &quot;relational&quot;) property is a property that depends on a thing&#x27;s relationship with other things. The latter is sometimes also called an &quot;attribute&quot;, since the value of that property is &quot;given&quot; to the object via its relation with another object. For example, mass is a physical intrinsic property of any physical object, whereas weight is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed. Another example of a relational property is the &quot;name&quot; of a person (an attribute given by the person&#x27;s parents).

===Essential and accidental===
In classical Aristotelian terminology, a &quot;property&quot; (Greek: &quot;idion&quot;, Latin: &quot;proprium&quot;) is one of the predicables. It is a non-essential quality of a species (like an accident), but a quality which is nevertheless characteristically present in members of that species. For example, &quot;ability to laugh&quot; may be considered a special characteristic of human beings. However, &quot;laughter&quot; is not an essential quality of the species &quot;human&quot;, whose Aristotelian definition of &quot;rational animal&quot; does not require laughter. Therefore, in the classical framework, &quot;properties&quot; are characteristic qualities that are not truly required for the continued existence of an entity but are, nevertheless, possessed by the entity.

===Determinate and determinable===
A property may be classified as either determinate or determinable. A determinable property is one that can get more specific. For example, color is a determinable property because it can be restricted to redness, blueness, etc. A determinate property is one that cannot become more specific. This distinction may be useful in dealing with issues of identity.

===Pure and impure===
Impure properties are properties that, unlike pure properties, involve reference to a particular substance in their definition. So, for example, &quot;being a wife&quot; is a pure property while &quot;being the wife of Socrates&quot; is an impure property due to the reference to the particular &quot;Socrates&quot;. Sometimes, the terms &quot;qualitative&quot; and &quot;non-qualitative&quot; are used instead of &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;impure&quot;. Most but not all &quot;impure properties&quot; are extrinsic properties. This distinction is relevant for the principle of identity of indiscernibles, which states that two things are identical if they are indiscernible, i.e. if they share all their properties. This principle is usually defined in terms of pure properties only. The reason for this is that impure properties are not relevant for similarity or discernibility but taking them into consideration nonetheless would result in the principle being trivially true. Another application of this distinction concerns the problem of duplication, for example, in the Twin Earth thought experiment. It is usually held that duplication only involves qualitative identity but perfect duplicates can still differ concerning their &quot;non-qualitative&quot; or &quot;impure&quot; properties.

===Lovely and suspect===
Daniel Dennett distinguishes between lovely properties (such as loveliness itself), which, although they
require an observer to be recognised, exist latently in perceivable objects; and suspect properties which have no existence at all until attributed by an observer (such as being suspected of a crime).

==Properties and predicates==
The ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a predicate to a subject. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as Russell&#x27;s paradox and the Grelling–Nelson paradox. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates &quot;..weighs more than 1.9 kilos&quot;, &quot;..weighs more than 1.8 kilos&quot;, etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as &quot;is an individual&quot;, or &quot;has some properties&quot; are uninformative or vacuous. There is some resistance to regarding such so-called &quot;Cambridge properties&quot; as legitimate. These properties in the widest sense are sometimes referred to as &quot;abundant properties&quot;. They are contrasted with &quot;sparse properties&quot;, which include only properties &quot;responsible for the objective resemblances and causal powers of things&quot;.

== Role in similarity ==
The traditional conception of similarity holds that properties are responsible for similarity: two objects are similar because they have a property in common. The more properties they share, the more similar they are. They resemble each other exactly if they share all their properties. For this conception of similarity to work, it is important that only properties relevant to resemblance are taken into account, sometimes referred to as &quot;sparse properties&quot; in contrast to &quot;abundant properties&quot;.

==Relations==

The distinction between properties and relations can hardly be given in terms that do not ultimately presuppose it.

Relations are true of several particulars, or shared amongst them. Thus the relation &quot;... is taller than ...&quot; holds &quot;between&quot; two individuals, who would occupy the two ellipses (&#x27;...&#x27;). Relations can be expressed by N-place predicates, where N is greater than 1.

Relations should be distinguished from relational properties. For example, &quot;marriage&quot; is a relation since it is between two people, but &quot;being married to X&quot; is a relational property had by a certain person since it concerns only one person.

There are at least some apparent relational properties which are merely derived from non-relational (or 1-place) properties. For instance &quot;A is heavier than B&quot; is a relational &quot;predicate&quot;, but it is derived from the two non relational properties: the mass of A and the mass of B. Such relations are called external relations, as opposed to the more genuine internal relations. Some philosophers believe that all relations are external, leading to a scepticism about relations in general, on the basis that external relations have no fundamental existence.

<doc id="508070" wikidata="Q2164293" url="?curid=508070" title="Telescoping series">
<text>In mathematics, a telescoping series is a series whose general term formula_1 is of the form formula_2, i.e. the difference of two consecutive terms of a sequence formula_3. As a consequence the partial sums of the series only consists of two terms of formula_3 after cancellation. 

The cancellation technique, with part of each term cancelling with part of the next term, is known as the method of differences.

An early statement of the formula for the sum or partial sums of a telescoping series can be found in a 1644 work by Evangelista Torricelli, &quot;De dimensione parabolae&quot;.

== Definition ==
Telescoping sums are finite sums in which pairs of consecutive terms partly cancel each other, leaving only parts of the initial and final terms. Let formula_5 be the elements of a sequence of numbers. Then
formula_6
If formula_7 converges to a limit formula_8, the telescoping series gives:
formula_9

Every series is a telescoping series of its own partial sums.

==Examples==
* The product of a geometric series with initial term formula_10 and common ratio formula_11 by the factor formula_12 yields a telescoping sum, which allows for a direct calculation of its limit:formula_13when formula_14 so when formula_14 formula_16

* The seriesformula_17is the series of reciprocals of pronic numbers, and it is recognizable as a telescoping series once rewritten in partial fraction form formula_18

* Let &quot;k&quot; be a positive integer. Thenformula_19 where &quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the &quot;k&quot;th harmonic number.

* Let &quot;k&quot; and &quot;m&quot; with &quot;k&quot; formula_20 &quot;m&quot; be positive integers. Thenformula_21 where formula_22 denotes the factorial operation.

* Many trigonometric functions also admit representation as differences, which may reveal telescopic canceling between the consecutive terms. Using the angle addition identity for a product of sines,formula_23 which does not converge as formula_24

== Applications ==
In probability theory, a Poisson process is a stochastic process of which the simplest case involves &quot;occurrences&quot; at random times, the waiting time until the next occurrence having a memoryless exponential distribution, and the number of &quot;occurrences&quot; in any time interval having a Poisson distribution whose expected value is proportional to the length of the time interval. Let &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; be the number of &quot;occurrences&quot; before time &quot;t&quot;, and let &quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot; be the waiting time until the &quot;x&quot;th &quot;occurrence&quot;. We seek the probability density function of the random variable &quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot;. We use the probability mass function for the Poisson distribution, which tells us that
: formula_25
where λ is the average number of occurrences in any time interval of length 1. Observe that the event {&quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; ≥ x} is the same as the event {&quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot;}, and thus they have the same probability. Intuitively, if something occurs at least formula_26 times before time formula_27, we have to wait at most formula_27 for the formula_29 occurrence. The density function we seek is therefore
: formula_30
The sum telescopes, leaving

A &quot;telescoping product&quot; is a finite product (or the partial product of an infinite product) that can be canceled by the method of quotients to be eventually only a finite number of factors. It is the finite products in which consecutive terms cancel denominator with numerator, leaving only the initial and final terms. Let formula_5 be a sequence of numbers. Then, 
formula_33
If formula_34 converges to 1, the resulting product gives:
formula_35

For example, the infinite product
formula_36
simplifies as
formula_37

<text>Jacques de Larosière de Champfeu (; born 12 November 1929) is a French former civil servant who served as the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1993 to 1998. He previously served as the governor of the Banque de France from 1987 to 1993. Before that appointment, he was also the sixth managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 1978 to 1987

==Early life and education==
Larosière descends from Joseph Thebaud. He studied at Lycée Louis-le-Grand and Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Paris. He graduated from École nationale d&#x27;administration in 1958 and entered the elite French Finance Ministry internal inspectorate known as the &quot;Inspection générale des finances&quot;.

==Career==
===Career in government===
From 1965 to 1974 Larosière worked at the within the French Finance Ministry. He then briefly joined the private office (&quot;cabinet&quot;) of Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, and following the latter election as French President, was appointed Director of the French Treasury in 1974, a position he held for the next four years.

===Career in international finance===
Larosière served as the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 17 June 1978 to 15 January 1987.

From 1987 to 1993 he was the Governor of the Banque de France.

After successfully competing against Giuliano Amato, Leszek Balcerowicz and Henning Christophersen to become the European Union&#x27;s nominee for the post, Larosière became President of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in September 1993. His appointment came in the wake of the scandals that led to the departure of the EBRD&#x27;s first president, Jacques Attali. He left this position in 1998 after restoring the bank&#x27;s reputation and credibility.

===Later career===
In 1992 Larosière became a member of the Washington-based Group of Thirty. In 2000 he co-created Eurofi and became its co-chair together with , then sole chair from 2011 to 2016.

In the wake of the Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso asked Larosière to lead a high-level group that in February 2009 produced a landmark report, known as the &quot;Larosière Report&quot; and recommending a broad overhaul of the European Union financial regulatory architecture. The Larosiere Report&#x27;s suggestions were adopted in EU legislation enacted in 2010 that created the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority, and the European Systemic Risk Board.

As of 2021 he remains Chairman of the Strategic Committee of the French debt management office, the &quot;&quot;, and advisor to BNP Paribas.

<text>A devil, also referred to as a baatezu, is a group of fictional creatures in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) roleplaying game typically presented as formidable opponents for advanced players. Devils are characterized by their Lawful Evil alignment and are depicted as originating from the Nine Hells of Baator. They follow a strict and hierarchical structure, progressing through various forms as they rise in rank. At the top of this hierarchy are the Archdevils, also known as the Lords of the Nine, who govern different regions within Baator. Devils are often portrayed as seeing the various worlds in the D&amp;D universe as tools to be exploited for their objectives, such as participating in the Blood War—a centuries-long conflict against demons.

==Publication history==
Devils first appeared in the original first-edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;Monster Manual&quot;.

The release of the 2nd Edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; brought a name change for the devils and their counterparts, demons. The 1st Edition&#x27;s &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; sourcebook was described as &quot;exactly like witchcraft&quot; by a televangelist. Concerned about protests from religious groups and others who viewed the game as an entryway into Satanic worship, TSR, Inc. dropped the words &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;demon&quot; from all descriptors of the monsters, substituting instead, baatezu and tanar&#x27;ri . This persisted until the rollout of the 3rd Edition when the original terms were reinstated. Since the change, the term &quot;baatezu&quot; has been retained as a specific subset of powerful devils.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition (1977–1988)===
Devils first appeared in the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977), which included the barbed devil (lesser devil), the bone devil (lesser devil), the erinyes (lesser devil), the horned devil (malebranche) (greater devil), the ice devil (greater devil), the lemure, the pit fiend (greater devil), and the arch-devils Asmodeus, Baalzebul, Dispater, and Geryon. The imp, a frequent servant of devils, also first appeared in the original &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. The &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was reviewed by Don Turnbull in the British magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #8 (August/September 1978). As part of his review, Turnbull comments on several new monsters introduced in the book and considered devils the most prominent among them. Turnbull notes that &quot;they are all pretty strong and compare not unfavourably in this respect with the Demons we already know&quot;.

Astaroth, Belial, and Satan appeared in the article &quot;The Politics of Hell,&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; # 28 (August 1979); note that this article does not appear to be connected to the established canon of the Nine Hells. Selm, Prince of the Possessors, and the Asperim appeared in &quot;Dragon&quot; #42 (October 1980).

The Styx devil (greater devil) first appears in the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; (1981).

A series of articles appearing in &quot;Dragon&quot; in 1983 greatly expanded upon the devils and their home, the Nine Hells, and introduced numerous new devils and arch-devils. The article &quot;From the Sorcerer&#x27;s Scroll: New Denizens of Devildom&quot; by Gary Gygax in &quot;Dragon&quot; #75 (July 1983) introduced the black abishai, blue abishai, green abishai, red abishai, and white abishai (lesser devils), the bearded devil (lesser devil), the spined devil (least devil), the princess of Hell Glasya, the dukes of Hell Amon, Bael, Bitru, Hutijin, and Titivilus, and the arch devils Belial, Mammon, Mephistopheles, and Moloch. Dozens of unique devils appeared in a two-part article by Ed Greenwood, including the greater devils Bist, Caim, and Nergal, the dukes of Hell Agares, Alocer, Amduscias, Arioch, Balan, Bathym, Biffant, Caarcrinolaas, Chamo, Focalor, Gaziel, Gorson, Herodias, Machalas, Malphas, Melchon, and Merodach, and the princesses of Hell Cozbi, Lilis, and Naome in &quot;The Nine Hells Part I&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; #75, and the dukes of Hell Abigor, Adonides, Barbas, Barbatos, Bele, Bifrons, Bileth, Buer, Bune, Morax, Neabaz, Rimmon, Tartach, Zagum, and Zepar, the princesses of Hell Baalphegor, Baftis, and Lilith, the chancellor of Hell Adramalech, the queen of Hell Bensozia, and the inquisitor of Hell Phongor in &quot;The Nine Hells Part II&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; #76 (August 1983).

The black abishai, blue abishai, green abishai, red abishai, and white abishai (lesser devils), the bearded devil (lesser devil), the nupperibo (least devil), and the spined devil (least devil), appeared in the first edition &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; (1983), along with the princess of Hell Glasya, the dukes of Hell Amon, Bael, Hutijin, and Titivilus, and the arch devils Belial, Mammon, Mephistopheles, and Moloch. Ed Greenwood&#x27;s follow-up article, &quot;The Nine Hells Revisited&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; #91 (November 1984), introduced the greater devils Armaros, Azazel, Cahor, Dagon, Duskur, Kochbiel, Malarea, Nisroch, Rumjal, and the arch-devil Gargoth.

Baalphegor appeared as the ultimate villain of &quot;Caermor&quot; in &quot;Dungeon&quot; #2 (November 1986) (which was later reprinted in the &quot;Dungeons of Despair&quot; anthology (1999).).
===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition (1989–1999)===

The black abishai, green abishai, and red abishai, lesser baatezu, and the pit fiend greater baatezu next appear in the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993).

The Planescape campaign setting utilized devils, known exclusively as baatezu under 2nd edition rules, extensively.

&quot;Guide to Hell&quot; (1999) described the transition of the devils and archdevils throughout the millennia, and reconciled the differences between the first edition and second edition archdevils by explaining the Reckoning of Hell. The book also describes the mezzikim. Moloch appeared in and played a key role in the adventure &quot;The Apocalypse Stone&quot; (2000).

==History==
The Reckoning of Hell (often referred to as the Reckoning) was a civil war that shaped the political landscape of the Nine Hells into its current form. The Reckoning received its fullest treatment in the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; sourcebook, &quot;A Guide to Hell&quot;.

==Types==

===Archdevils===
Zariel is the current ruler of Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. She was previously deposed by her chief warlord, a pit fiend called Bel, thousands of years in the past. However, she reclaimed her position after Bel proved inadequate in managing the Blood War. My legions are the only thing standing between your precious Seven Heavens and the bottomless hunger of the Abyss. I did not fall into the clutches of evil. I rose to shoulder a cosmic burden.

&quot;—&quot; Zariel, Archduchess of Avernus, former angel of CelestiaOriginally, she was an angel of Celestia who was charged with watching the Blood War. Instead of just observing, she marshaled forces and charged into Hell. Zariel succumbed to the corrupting nature of the plane and fell from grace. Asmodeus then put her in charge of Avernus. She was first mentioned in the second edition book &quot;Guide to Hell&quot; (1999). Zariel was also mentioned in third edition in the &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2001), and &quot;Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells&quot; (2006). In 5th Edition, Zariel was given a stat block in &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s Tome of Foes&quot; (2018). She is also featured heavily in the adventure module &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Descent into Avernus&quot; (2019).

====Asmodeus====
Asmodeus ( or ) is a fictional character from the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying game. His exact nature varies from publication to publication; he is alternately presented as an evil god or a powerful devil. In all publication appearances, he is the Lord of Hell (Baator) and the Overlord of the lesser Dukes of Hell.

Asmodeus is named after Asmodeus, a Judeo-Christian demon of the same name, from the &quot;Book of Tobit&quot;, and for a fallen angel of the same name who appears in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot;

His physical appearance is based on popular modern and medieval conceptions of Satan. Asmodeus first appears in the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977).

Baator and Asmodeus&#x27; place in it were further detailed in Ed Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;The Nine Hells Part II&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; #76 (1983).

Owing to a moral panic regarding &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Asmodeus did not initially appear in the 2nd edition.

In the Planescape line of game products, the lord of the lowest circle of hell was initially unnamed. Eventually, the Lord of the Ninth was revealed to be Asmodeus, in &quot;Guide to Hell&quot; (1999).

Asmodeus appeared along with the other lords of the Nine Hells in the &quot;Book of Vile Darkness&quot; (2002). He was further described in &quot;Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells&quot; (2006).

Conflicting stories of Asmodeus&#x27; power and origins are given throughout both books, ostensibly as an in-universe foil to those wishing to learn more about him.

Asmodeus appears as an evil god in the &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; (2008). His backstory for this edition is expanded in the supplements &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;, &quot;The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea&quot;, and &quot;Demonomicon&quot;. His origins are explicitly defined as the leader of a rebellion against a forgotten god of good.

Setting-specific versions of Asmodeus are described in the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide&quot; and the &quot;Eberron Campaign Guide&quot;. The &quot;Realms&quot; Asmodeus differs from the core character: he has only become a full god in the wake of the Spellplague, while the core version has been a god for millennia. Much of this information was presented as a retcon to justify changes from previous editions&#x27; settings.

It is unclear whether the &quot;Eberron&quot; Asmodeus is meant to be a literal god, since that setting&#x27;s deities are much more aloof than those of other settings. His character is consistent with the generic presentation, however: he is the undisputed master of the Nine Hells.

In the &quot;Sword Coast Adventurer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, the &quot;Realms&quot; Asmodeus retains the same recent history as the 4th edition version. He consumed the divine spark of Azuth, and through it achieved godhood during the Spellplague. This means that, while before the Spellplague he was Lord of the Nine Hells, and a powerful immortal being, he only became a god after the Spellplague.

Similar characters have appeared in products by publishers other than TSR or Wizards of the coast (copyright holders for Dungeons &amp; Dragons material). The character is Wizards&#x27; intellectual property. However, because Asmodeus (the original mythical being) is in the public domain, the name and associated demonic characteristics may be used without infringing Wizards&#x27; copyright.

Asmodeus became an official part of the Judge&#x27;s Guild &quot;City State of the Invincible Overlord&quot; setting with the publication of &quot;The Azurerain Pirates&quot;.

Green Ronin&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Fiends&quot; series mentions Asmodeus. This series is published under the OGL.

Another OGL product was &quot;Asmodeus&#x27;s Den of Deception&quot;, part of the &quot;Devilish Dens&quot; series.

Asmodeus features prominently in the &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot; setting.

His appearance in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was cited as evidence for Satanism in the game by Pat Pulling and Kathy Cawthon in their 1989 book &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Web&quot;.

The inclusion of Asmodeus and other Judeo-Christian devils in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is discussed in &quot;Pegasus&quot; magazine as well.

Fabian Perlini-Pfister considered demons like Asmodeus among the &quot;standard repertoire of &quot;Monsters&quot;&quot; of the game.

Asmodeus is the most powerful of infernal beings. Like the other Archdevils, he is impervious to mundane attacks and requires powerful magics to slay. A powerful aura of submission surrounds him, making most who approach him slaves to his will.

As the master of Hell, he has complete power over lesser devils, including other lords of Baator. Several times he has permanently changed their physical forms at a whim. He transformed Mammon into a humanoid/serpent hybrid, and cursed Baalzebul with the form of a gigantic slug with tiny, useless arms.

Asmodeus carries a powerful unique artifact, the Ruby Rod, that allows him to use several powerful offensive and defensive spells. The Rod allows Asmodeus to attack with elemental forces, force his enemies to cower in fear, or cover himself with a field which heals and protects him. It is also a powerful melee weapon that can cause grievous wounds with the merest touch. In the default 4th edition setting, the Ruby Rod is a fragment of the shard of pure evil that created the Abyss, but this origin is not suggested in earlier editions.

In addition to the Ruby Rod, Asmodeus possesses material wealth greater than entire mortal worlds. His clothing is so valuable that a single garment worn by Asmodeus is worth more than an average nation will spend on food in a year.

Finally, Asmodeus is an ancient schemer and deadly manipulator, orchestrator of the most Machiavellian of schemes. He lays plans millennia in advance, patiently biding his time until his machinations come to fruition.

Through all five editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Asmodeus is depicted as the strongest, most cunning, and most handsome of all devils. He is typically described as appearing as a giant human, over 13 feet tall, with dark skin and hair, red eyes, handsome features, and small horns on his forehead. Beneath his clothing, Asmodeus&#x27; body is covered in bloody wounds which he sustained when he fell from the Upper Planes. His wounds ooze blood daily, and any drop of blood which touches the ground grows into a powerful devil.

He is described in the &quot;Book of Vile Darkness&quot; as a &quot;calm, chillingly reasonable&quot; being with a modest appearance that hides his true power.

In &quot;Dragon&quot; # 28, the article &quot;The Politics of Hell&quot; presents a different version of Asmodeus where he is the latest in a series of hellish rulers. Asmodeus overthrows Beelzebul, who in turn overthrew Satan. This early biography differs from later presentations.

In the &quot;Book of Vile Darkness&quot;, it is stated that while Asmodeus is the oldest devil in the Nine Hells, he may not be the original ruler.

&quot;Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells&quot; offers its own internally inconsistent accounts of Asmodeus&#x27; origins. It is suggested that, within the fictional settings of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, these accounts may be differing interpretations of an underlying monomyth.

According to the &quot;Codex&quot;, Asmodeus began as a servant of the lawful gods. Asmodeus is described in some versions of the myth as an &quot;angel&quot; (though this is self-contradictory given the time period during which this would have occurred). He was &quot;the bravest, toughest, fiercest and most beautiful of angels.&quot; He and the other angels were created to fight the demons of the Abyss, so that the gods could concern themselves with creating worlds and sentient beings.

After eons of fighting the creatures from the abyss, Asmodeus and some of his fellows began to change. They grew similar in appearance and methods to the demons which they fought. Afraid of his power and of the changes he had undergone, the gods put Asmodeus on trial and demanded that he be cast out of the Upper Planes. However, he argued effectively (and correctly) that he and his fellows had not violated the law. Asmodeus and his followers successfully sued for access to the Upper Planes and the honors to which they were entitled.

Once the gods created worlds and sentient beings, the demons attacked these, too. The gods created mountains, oceans, and wastelands to seal up the gates to the Abyss, but their creations defied their orders and explored their worlds, accidentally unsealing the gates. The gods could not understand why their creations did not follow their instructions, until Asmodeus explained to them that their system did not work because it relied solely upon voluntary compliance. Asmodeus explained that the only way to ensure obedience was to threaten mortals with a disincentive; hence, Asmodeus invented the concept of punishment.

Asmodeus convinced the gods to sign a contract called the Pact Primeval. This contract allowed Asmodeus and his fellow devils to take up residence in the abandoned realm of Baator, to punish the souls of wicked mortals, and to extract magical energy from the souls under their care in order to fuel their powers. Otherwise, Asmodeus reasoned, they would have to be granted the powers of godhood in order to do their job, which the current gods would surely find unacceptable.

In the myth that Asmodeus created Baator (from the &quot;Codex&quot;) it states that Asmodeus tortured souls in a far off section of the upper planes and that when their screams filled heaven the gods once again tried to remove Asmodeus from the upper planes, but by the Pact Primeval Asmodeus was allowed to torture the souls in heaven. Asmodeus offered the gods an alternative; give him the power to create his own plane of existence from which to torture the souls that broke heavenly law. The gods agreed and Asmodeus and his devils left and created the Nine Layers of Hell.

In both myths, the gods found the arrangement agreeable, at first. However, they eventually realized that fewer and fewer mortal souls were ascending to the Upper Planes, and Asmodeus was deliberately tempting mortals to damnation. When they arrived in Baator, the gods found that Asmodeus had turned it into a nightmarish world of endless suffering, filled with countless new devils. When called to account for his actions, Asmodeus uttered the famous words, &quot;Read the fine print.&quot;

This story is presented as mythology, and the &quot;Codex&quot; itself admits that it does not tell the whole truth. For example, it is known that Asmodeus did not depart from the Upper Planes under amicable circumstances: He was cast out, and literally fell into the Lower Planes, sustaining serious wounds which have never healed. Part of Asmodeus&#x27; long-term plans includes using the magical energy harvested from souls in order to heal his wounds, and ultimately, the complete destruction of the Upper Planes, as well as to one day achieve godhood.

The names of the &quot;gods&quot; involved seem to change depending on what world and on which source the myth is told, and some aspects and versions of the origin myth contradict others. For example, the version told in the &quot;Fiendish Codex II&quot; states that St. Cuthbert became a distinct deity when he agreed with Asmodeus that &quot;Retribution is the basis of all law,&quot; while the &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; sourcebook states that he is a mortal who ascended to godhood.

The &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; suggests a similar but different story. According to the section about the Nine Hells, Asmodeus&#x27; true form is that of a giant serpent. He was cast out of the Upper Planes before the creation of the current gods, and his fall created the 8th and 9th planes of Hell. He is currently still recovering from his wounds in the pits of the 9th level, and his devil form is just an avatar of the real Asmodeus. No one who tells the story of the true form of Asmodeus survives more than 24 hours after the telling. These stories are always connected with the name Ahriman of couatl history.

This story first appeared in the AD&amp;D supplement &quot;Guide to Hell&quot;: Asmodeus is described as Ahriman, the twin brother of Jazirian the god of the couatls. In this story Jazirian and Ahriman were responsible for the establishment of the current arrangement of the planes but fought eventually because of their perspectives of the law (LG versus LE). Asmodeus is said to be a greater power without any need of worship in the guide. As the Forgotten Realms supplement Serpent Kingdoms, as well as the 2e supplement Monster Mythology, tells Jazirian is/was the lawful good aspect of the now-dead overpower the World Serpent, Asmodeus should be the lawful evil one. This interpretation puts Asmodeus as a more supreme evil than other equally official D&amp;D canon, as he was in this material set up as the co-equal first cause of creation and the evil principle therein, rather than a reactionary segment and of evils potentially interpreted as lesser evil due to being meant to combat the demons of the abyss only having gone overboard, as in subsequent explanations of his origin.

In &quot;Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells&quot;, Asmodeus is described as one of the primal forces of evil in the D&amp;D universe, and had a hand in creating Baator in order to punish sinners for their crimes. After being granted the power to do so, Asmodeus and his followers began consuming souls for power. Despite the horror of the good gods who&#x27;d established the Hells as a punishment, they didn&#x27;t also expect its existence to help fuel evil in the world. As the devils consumed the essences of souls, they began to mutate into the devils that now populate the D&amp;D universe.

&quot;Elder Evils&quot; names the original ruler of Hell as Zargon, a creature originally described in Dungeon Module B4: &quot;The Lost City&quot;, by Tom Moldvay.

The core setting of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th Edition offers yet another origin for Asmodeus, identifying him as a former angel in service to a god only known as He Who Was. Asmodeus, as one of the greatest of the angels, was entrusted with leading angelic hosts in battle against the enemies of the gods. Though he served He Who Was loyally, Asmodeus believed that his deific master was far too forgiving and unwilling to use force. After the conflict, which came to be known as the Dawn War, Asmodeus was assigned to guard the entrance to the prison of the god Tharizdun which was located in the Abyss. The demon lord Pazuzu appeared to Asmodeus, as detailed in &quot;Demonomicon&quot;, and encouraged the angel to act on his thoughts of rebellion against He Who Was. When Asmodeus was ready to rise up, Pazuzu aided him in obtaining a small piece of the shard of evil at the heart of the Abyss, which Asmodeus used to create his infamous Ruby Rod. Asmodeus returned to Baathion, the realm of He Who Was, gathered those angels who would join his side, and instigated a rebellion that ended with his former master&#x27;s death. With his last moments of life, He Who Was cursed Asmodeus and all the angels who had followed him. The angels were transformed into the first devils, and the beautiful astral dominion of Baathion was transformed into a prison realm known as the Nine Hells of Baator. Asmodeus assumed the divine might of the fallen deity and became a god himself, albeit one trapped inside his own dominion.

During the Dawn War he worked with Bane; although they hated each other personally they were disciplined enough to work well together. After the war, Bane anticipated the eventual angelic rebellion Asmodeus would launch, and alone of the Gods he was not surprised when it finally happened. Bane wanted to help, but both he and Asmodeus wanted to avoid bringing the other Gods into the fight, and feared that any open collaboration between the two of them would cause exactly that; to avoid notice, instead of soldiers Bane sent aid in the form of advisors and strategy experts. Whether or not this made any difference is unknown, but the devils will deal (slightly) more honestly with followers of Bane than worshippers of other Gods, and Bane&#x27;s followers are more likely than others to summon and employ devils.

Asmodeus has few allies amongst the other Gods, and is on especially bad terms with Moradin and Avandra. He has a cordial relationship with Erathis, who regards tyranny as just another form that civilization can take. Asmodeus and Bane still maintain a facade of friendship, at least until one is powerful and confident enough to actually overthrow the other.

It is said that Asmodeus owes Pazuzu a favor for his help in the war, and has not yet repaid him.

Asmodeus is devoted to oppression and might through subversive action. He imposes strict rules and harsh punishments on his followers. The cult of Asmodeus urges its adherents to seek power over others, to repay evil with further evil (an eye for an eye), to exploit kindness for personal gain, and to show no compassion for the weak and downtrodden. All done in the most legal possible manner of course, and never overtly.

Typical rhetoric from worshippers of Asmodeus will discuss &quot;promoting personal excellence and independence,&quot; &quot;taking care of one&#x27;s own affairs&quot; and &quot;ridding oneself of weakness&quot;. Sometimes one will hear of &quot;ascending to godhood&quot;, or &quot;no gods, no masters&quot;. When harming innocents, their actions are discussed as &quot;providing motivation to succeed&quot;. Most often, ritual practices are deeply secretive and not publicly discussed. Most followers will not publicly admit their worship of Asmodeus, as that would compromise their potential bargaining position for greater power over non-followers.

Though Asmodeus&#x27;s faith is by far the largest of the diabolic cults, few of Asmodeus&#x27; followers are known by name. A notable exception is Christophe Jean Markosian, &quot;The Devil Behind Thrones,&quot; a hierarch of the Horned Society. Most of Asmodeus&#x27;s worshippers are based in the towns and cities of humans and demihumans, though Asmodeus has some monstrous followers as well. His cultists use his faith as a stepping stone to wealth and power. They form secret alliances, using their wealth and connections to bring status and power to other members of the society.

According to the &quot;Guide to Hell&quot;, though he has worshipers and does on occasion grant them clerical powers, his true identity as Ahriman makes him loath to expand his cult. This is because his true motivation is to spread atheism through the multiverse and make all believe that &quot;gods&quot; are not divine at all, but beings who have achieved great power. In his plan, when belief fails, the outer planes will cease to exist. As Ahriman the evil lawmaker of the whole of the cosmos and unfettered by belief himself, he can then remold the multiverse perfectly according to his desires, and this time not having to share in its creation with Jazirian: the good creator of the multiverse&#x27;s orderly structure. There will be no remnant of chaos as a result, or any missing rules in this future outer ring of planes, which will be the exclusive domain of Asmodeus.

In most lands, temples to Asmodeus are hidden subterranean complexes, though in places dominated by lawful evil, they may dominate the landscape. If a cult of Baalzebul overthrows the local government, cultists of Asmodeus typically assume control of their headquarters to bring the local diabolism into its &quot;establishment phase.&quot;

<text>The Westland Lynx is a British multi-purpose twin-engined military helicopter designed and built by Westland Helicopters at its factory in Yeovil. Originally intended as a utility craft for both civil and naval usage, military interest led to the development of both battlefield and naval variants. The Lynx went into operational usage in 1977 and was later adopted by the armed forces of over a dozen nations, primarily serving in the battlefield utility, anti-armour, search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare roles.

The Lynx is a fully aerobatic helicopter with the ability to perform loops and rolls. In 1986, a specially modified Lynx set the current Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&#x27;s official airspeed record for helicopters (category excludes compound helicopters) at , which remains unbroken as of January 2022.

Several land and naval variants of the Lynx have been produced along with some major derivatives. The Westland 30 was produced as a civil utility helicopter; it was not a commercial success and only a small number were built during the 1980s. In the 21st century, a modernised variant of the Lynx was designed as a multi-role combat helicopter, designated as the AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat; the Wildcat is intended to replace existing Lynx helicopters.

==Development==

===Origins===
The initial design, then known as the Westland WG.13, was started in the mid-1960s as a replacement for the Westland Scout and Wasp, and a more advanced alternative to the UH-1 Iroquois. The design was to be powered by a pair of Bristol Siddeley BS.360 turboshaft engines. As part of the Anglo-French helicopter agreement signed in February 1967, French company Sud Aviation (later Aérospatiale) had a 30 per cent share of production work, Westland performing the remainder. It was intended that France would procure the Lynx for its Navy and a heavily modified armed reconnaissance variant for the French Army, with the United Kingdom in return buying Aérospatiale Gazelle and Puma for its armed forces. In October 1969, the French Army cancelled its requirement for the Lynx, so development of the armed variant was terminated at an early stage.
The first Lynx prototype took its maiden flight on 21 March 1971. In 1972, a Lynx broke the world speed record over 15 and 25 km by flying at and set a new 100 km closed circuit record shortly afterwards, flying at ; both of these records were set by L. Roy Moxam OBE, Westland&#x27;s Deputy Chief Test Pilot (later Chief Test Pilot). In 1986, the former company demonstrator Lynx, registered &quot;G-LYNX&quot;, was specially modified with Gem 60 engines and British Experimental Rotor Programme (BERP) rotor blades. On 11 August 1986 the helicopter was piloted by Trevor Egginton when it set an absolute speed record for helicopters over a 15 and 25 km course by reaching ; an official record with the FAI it still holds. At this speed, its lift-to-drag ratio was 2, and its BERP blade tips reached a speed of Mach 0.97.

The British Army ordered over 100 Lynx helicopters under the designation of &quot;Lynx AH.1&quot; (&quot;A&quot;rmy &quot;H&quot;elicopter Mark 1) to perform several roles, such as transport, armed escort, anti-tank warfare (with eight TOW missiles), reconnaissance and evacuation missions. Deliveries of production helicopters began in 1977. An improved Lynx AH.1 with Gem 41-1 or Gem 42 engines and an uprated transmission was referred to as the &quot;Lynx AH.5&quot;; only five were built for evaluation. The AH.5 led to the &quot;Lynx AH.7&quot;, which added a new tail rotor derived from the Westland 30, a reinforced airframe, improved avionics and defensive aids.

The initial naval variant of the Lynx, known as the &quot;Lynx HAS.2&quot; in British service, or &quot;Lynx Mk.2(FN)&quot; in French service, differed from the Lynx AH.1 in being equipped with a tricycle undercarriage and a deck restraint system, folding main rotor blades, an emergency flotation system and a nose-mounted radar. An improved Lynx for the Royal Navy, the &quot;Lynx HAS.3&quot;, had Gem 42-1 Mark 204 engines, an uprated transmission, a new flotation system and an Orange Crop ESM system. The Lynx HAS.3 also received various other updates in service. A similar upgrade to the French Lynx was known as the &quot;Lynx Mk.4(FN)&quot;.

===Licensed manufacturing, Super Lynx, and Battlefield Lynx===
In September 1974, the British and Egyptian governments initiated talks to establish a new Egyptian helicopter manufacturer. Out of these talks, the Arab British Helicopter Company (ABHCO) was established during the 1970s; this new organisation was accompanied by an initial arrangement to manufacture under licence the Lynx AH.1 in Helwan, Egypt. A separate agreement was formalised with Rolls-Royce to license manufacture the Lynx&#x27;s Gem engines at the Helwan facility. However, this plan was ultimately aborted due to a lack of funds that resulted from the collapse of the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI).

Announced in 1984, the &quot;Lynx-3&quot; was an enhanced development, featuring a stretched fuselage, a redesigned tail boom, Gem 60-3/1 engines, a wheeled tricycle undercarriage, BERP rotor blades, and increased fuel capacity. Both Army and Naval variants were proposed; however, the project was ended in 1987 due to insufficient orders being placed. Only one Army Lynx-3 prototype was built. A development of the Lynx AH.7 with the wheeled undercarriage of the Lynx-3 was marketed by Westland as the &quot;Battlefield Lynx&quot; in the late 1980s. The prototype first flew in November 1989, and deliveries began in 1991. In British Army service this variant is designated as the &quot;Lynx AH.9&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Westland incorporated some of the technology from the Naval Lynx-3 design into a less-radical &quot;Super Lynx&quot;. This featured BERP rotor blades, the Westland 30-derived tail rotor, Gem 42 engines, a new under-nose 360-degree radar installation and an optional nose-mounted electro-optical sensor turret. Royal Navy Lynx HAS.3s upgraded to Super Lynx standard were known in service as the &quot;Lynx HMA.8&quot;, and several export customers ordered new-build or upgraded Super Lynxes. From the 1990s onwards, Westland began offering the &quot;Super Lynx 200&quot;, which was equipped with LHTEC CTS800 engines, and the &quot;Super Lynx 300&quot;, which also had a new cockpit and avionics derived from the AgustaWestland EH101. Both of these models have achieved several export sales. In 2002, &quot;Flight International&quot; reported that more than 40 variants of the Lynx were in service with different users, almost 400 aircraft having been built for various customers.

===Future Lynx/Lynx Wildcat===
The British Army and Royal Navy Lynx fleets were to be replaced to a new common advanced Lynx variant based on the Super Lynx 300, with a new tail boom, undercarriage, cockpit, avionics and sensors. Initially referred to as the Future Lynx, and later as the Lynx Wildcat, this type has since been re-designated as the AW159 Wildcat.

While having the Lynx as the origins and basis of its design, the Wildcat differs substantially. Only 5% of its components, including some main rotor gearbox parts and fuel system, remain interchangeable with previous Lynx variants.

==Design==
The Lynx is a multi-purpose twin-engine battlefield helicopter, of which specialised versions have been developed for both sea and land-based warfare. A distinguishing feature between early and later aircraft is the undercarriage: early Army versions of the Lynx were equipped with skids, while the Naval and later models have been outfitted with wheels, a requirement for easy ground handling on the deck of a warship. Early versions of the Lynx were powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem turboshaft engines and had a four-blade rotor, mounted on a rigid titanium monobloc rotor head of the kind pioneered by the MBB BO105 a few years earlier. The innovative blade design comprised a honeycomb sandwich structure made out of composite material. For shipboard stowage, both the rotor blades and tail can be folded. Lag dampers were incorporated but these are not required in flight (owing to the rigidity of the monobloc rotor head). The main rotor features a vibration absorption system.
The Lynx is an agile helicopter, capable of performing loops and rolls, and of attaining high speeds. The agility of the type led to its use as an aerial display aircraft, having been operated by the Blue Eagles and Black Cats helicopter display teams. The efficiency of the main rotor, as well as the overall top speed of the Lynx, was substantially improved with the adoption of BERP rotor blade technology. During the 1990s, the hot-and-high performance of the type was considerably boosted in the later Super Lynx 200 series, at which point the type&#x27;s Gem engines were replaced with the newer LHTEC T800 turboshaft engine with associated FADEC system; the Lynx can also maintain a good level of performance under moderate icing conditions. The FADEC controls eliminated the requirement for a throttle or manual speed selection switches, further simplifying flight control. Later aircraft feature automatic stabilisation equipment; functions such as auto-hover are installed on some Lynx.

Various avionics and on-board systems are integrated on the Lynx in order to perform differing mission profiles. Several operators have equipped their Lynx with BAE Systems&#x27; Seaspray surveillance radar to provide for a surface search capability, which is used in maritime patrol, search and rescue, and other mission profiles. British Army models are equipped with a Marconi Elliot automatic flight control system capable of performing automatic three axes stabilisation. The integration of both avionics and weapons systems is customised for each Lynx batch to customer specifications and requirements. Most of the installed sensors and avionics are typically integrated with the aircraft&#x27;s avionics management system (AMS), from where they can be managed by either pilot; sensors such the optional nose-mounted FLIR can be set up to directly cue the weapon systems. Functions such as navigation and communications are also tied into the AMS, with information from these systems displayed to the pilots on interchangeable integrated display units in the cockpit. The Lynx is considerably easier to service and maintain than the AgustaWestland Apache.
The Lynx features a two-man cockpit for a pilot and observer sitting side by side; the British Army typically operates their fleet with a three-man crew, a door gunner being the third member. The cabin, located behind the cockpit, is accessed through a pair of large sliding doors on each side of the fuselage; it can accommodate up to ten equipped troops, depending upon seating configuration. An alternative configuration houses radio equipment in the cabin area when the aircraft is being used in the airborne command post role; the cabin can also be used to house additional fuel tanks for conducting long distance missions and ferry trips. The Lynx can perform a wide variety of mission types, including anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, vessel replenishment, search and rescue, airborne reconnaissance, armed attack, casualty evacuation and troop transport; according to AgustaWestland, a Lynx can be converted from one mission-type to another within the space of 40 minutes.

Typical combat equipment includes stabilised roof-mounted sensors, onboard countermeasures and door guns; when being used in the anti-tank role, the Lynx is typically armed with BGM-71 TOW missiles; missiles such as the Sea Skua have been used in the maritime anti-surface role. Additional armaments that have been interchangeably used include rockets, 20 mm cannons, torpedoes, and depth charges. Those Lynx built for export have been typically outfitted with armaments and equipment customised for the end-user, such as the Mokopa air-to-surface missile used on Algeria&#x27;s Lynx fleet, eight of which can be carried; studies into equipping the AGM-114 Hellfire have been performed, and air-to-air missiles could also reportedly be adopted if the capability is sought by operators. Equipped armaments can be managed and controlled inflight through the onboard stores management system. In order to counteract battlefield threats such as infrared-guided missiles, various defensive aid subsystems can be optionally installed, including warning receivers and countermeasures.

Many of the Lynx&#x27;s components had been derived from earlier Westland helicopters such as the Scout and Wasp. The Lynx has been substantially upgraded since entering service in the 1970s; improvements made to in-service aircraft have typically included strengthened airframes, new avionics and engines, improved rotor blades, and additional surveillance and communications systems. Various subsystems from overseas suppliers have been incorporated into some Lynx variants; during a South Korean procurement, hulls produced in the United Kingdom were equipped with Korean-built systems, such as ISTAR, electro-optical, electronic warfare, fire-control systems, flight control actuators, and undercarriages. A glass cockpit was adopted on the Super Lynx 300, featuring fully integrated flight and mission display systems, a variety of integrated display units including head-up displays, and dual controls; AgustaWestland has commented that the new cockpit reduces aircrew workload and increases aircraft effectiveness. The head-up display installed could be replaced by a helmet-mounted sight system on customer demand.

==Operational history==

===United Kingdom===
The Lynx AH.1 entered service with the British Army&#x27;s Army Air Corps (AAC) in 1979, followed by the Lynx HAS.2 with the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) in 1981. The FAA fleet was upgraded to Lynx HAS.3 standard during the 1980s, and again to HMA.8 standard in the 1990s. Most Army aircraft were upgraded to Lynx AH.7 and the later AH.9/AH.9A standards as utility helicopters; they have also served with 3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron (3 CBAS) of the Royal Marines and later, the Commando Helicopter Force (CHF) of the FAA, operating as reconnaissance and attack/utility helicopters to support the Royal Marines. During the Cold War, it was envisioned that Army Lynxes would be paired with Westland Gazelle helicopters to counter Soviet armoured vehicles. Lynx HAS.3 and HMA.8 variants operate as anti-submarine warfare and maritime attack helicopters armed with Sting Ray torpedoes, Sea Skua anti-ship missiles and depth charges, from Royal Navy warships. Navy Lynx have been critical to maritime patrol operations, including non-military operations such as counter-narcotics missions.
The Lynx HAS.2 ASW variant participated in combat operations during the Falklands War in 1982. A combination of Lynx and Westland Sea King helicopters were used to maintain continuous anti-submarine patrols in order to protect the British task force offshore from the Falkland Islands. On 3 May, a Lynx conducted the first combat-firing of a Sea Skua missile, firing on the Argentinian patrol boat ARA &quot;Alférez Sobral&quot;, inflicting considerable damage to the vessel. This was the first use of sea-skimming missiles in the conflict. Although none were shot down in combat, a total of three were lost aboard vessels that were struck by attacks from Argentine aircraft, these vessels being , and SS &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;.

On 14 May 1989, in the type&#x27;s second fatal accident, Lynx HAS3GM &quot;XZ244&quot;, attached to , crashed near Mombasa, Kenya, while en route to the city&#x27;s airport for a period of shore leave. A door had detached when opened inflight and collided with the tail rotor, resulting in the aircraft splitting in half and the death of all nine personnel on board. As a result, door modifications and inflight opening restrictions were introduced. As of 2004, it remained the deadliest Lynx crash.

The Navy&#x27;s Lynx helicopters were among Britain&#x27;s contribution to the coalition against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. During the Battle of Bubiyan, the biggest naval engagement of the conflict, the Lynx and its Sea Skua missiles proved to be decisive, being responsible for the majority of individual engagements with various Iraqi Navy vessels. By 2 February 1991, 25 Sea Skuas had been launched, out of these, 18 were confirmed as having hit their targets, and had succeeding in heavily damaging a significant portion of Iraq&#x27;s navy. Navy Lynxes were routinely used to deploy troops to oil platforms and into occupied Kuwait, as well as to perform aerial reconnaissance across the Gulf.
The British Army also deployed 24 TOW-armed Lynxes alongside an equal number of Westland Gazelle helicopters during the Gulf War. They were assigned the mission of locating and attacking Iraqi tank concentrations, and to support the advance of coalition ground forces into Kuwait and Southern Iraq during the &quot;100 hours war&quot; phase of the conflict. On 26 February 1991, a Lynx of 654 Squadron AAC destroyed two MTLB armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and four T-55 tanks using TOW missiles: the engagement was the first recorded use of the missile from a British helicopter.

On 19 March 1994, during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) brought down Lynx AH.7 &quot;ZD275&quot; of the AAC with an improvised mortar, striking it while attempting to land at Crossmaglen Army base. The pilot managed to crash land and the aircraft was destroyed, but all crew on board survived. Author Toby Harnden described the incident as the IRA&#x27;s most successful operation against a helicopter.

British army helicopter crashed near Gornji Vakuf, Bosnia on 22 December 1998. Two servicemen were killed and a third crew member was critically wounded.

Various British Lynxes were used during the NATO intervention in the conflict between Serbia and Kosovo, later known as the Kosovo War. They were frequently employed to supply NATO forces inside the theatre, including those engaged in humanitarian operations. In June 1999, the type was employed to escort British ground forces being air-deployed into Kosovo via Chinooks, during NATO&#x27;s first phase of deployment. For a number of years, British Army Lynx and Gazelle helicopters were deployed within Kosovo, performing reconnaissance and transport duties in support of NATO peacekeeping forces.

In September 2000, Army Lynxes were used in Sierra Leone to rescue several British soldiers during Operation Barras. In 2002, a Lynx attached to crashed 200 miles off the coast of Virginia.
In March 2003, the Lynx formed the bulk of the deployed British rotary aviation battle group in the invasion of Iraq. Participating aircraft were quickly outfitted with engine sand filters, armour, heat dissipaters, modern secure radios and radar warning receivers. In the subsequent multi-national occupation force, a flight of either AAC or CHF Lynx AH.7s were based at Basra International Airport under command of the Joint Helicopter Force (Iraq) on a rotational basis. In theatre, they would escort infantry patrols, perform aerial reconnaissance, provide fire support and act as airborne communications hubs. Problems in operating in the high temperature environment were encountered, with the helicopters often operating with no power reserve and thus without the ability to overshoot during landings; these problems were belatedly overcome by the introduction of the Lynx AH.9A.

On 6 May 2006, Lynx AH.7 &quot;XZ6140&quot; of the CHF, was shot down by a man-portable surface-to-air missile over Basra, southern Iraq; the first British helicopter and only the second British aircraft downed (the first was an RAF Hercules) by enemy fire in the war. Among the five killed were 847 Naval Air Squadron&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Darren Chapman; Wing Commander Coxen, who had been due to take command of the region&#x27;s British helicopter forces, and Flight Lieutenant Sarah-Jayne Mulvihill; Coxen was the most senior British officer to die in the conflict and Mulvihill was the first British servicewoman to die in action in 22 years. At the crash scene, British troops reportedly encountered rioting Iraqi civilians and were fired on by militia, while civilians were killed in the ensuing clashes. The crash led to a review of the vulnerability of helicopter transports in southern Iraq.

In 2006, the first Lynx AH.7 was deployed to Helmand Province, Afghanistan; this variant would only be subsequently used during winter months due to the performance limitations imposed during the high summer temperatures. The Lynx AH.9A later deployed was praised as having been a substantial performance improvement. On 26 April 2014, Lynx AH.9A &quot;ZF540&quot; of the Army Air Corps crashed near Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan, killing the three crew and two passengers on board. This was the first fatal accident in the conflict involving a British military helicopter and the third largest loss of life of British troops in a single incident in Afghanistan since 2001.

The Royal Navy retired its Lynx helicopters from active service on 23 March 2017 with its official decommissioning. On 17 March, a final flypast was conducted by four Royal Navy Westland Lynx HMA8 helicopters from 815 Naval Air Squadron, based at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset. The Army Air Corps retired the Lynx in 2018, with the disbandment of 657 Squadron AAC.

===Germany===
The first German Navy Lynx, a Sea Lynx Mk88 model, was manufactured in 1981. A total of 19 were built. In 1996, the German Navy elected to purchase seven additional Super Lynx Mk88As; in 1998, the decision was taken to upgrade the existing Mk88 fleet, by then numbering a total of 17, to the improved Mk88A standard. In the anti-surface role, Germany&#x27;s Lynx fleet were supplemented by several Westland Sea Kings, which were upgraded with Sea Skua missiles in the 1990s. In 2009, Germany was studying a limited upgrade programme for their Super Lynx fleet which reportedly included the replacement of the current anti-ship missile. In 2013, the German defence ministry signed a contract with Selex ES to integrate new electro-optical/infrared sensors onto the Super Lynx.

Since 2012, German Lynx have been deployed routinely off the coast of Somalia to discourage and intervene against acts of piracy as a part of the multinational Operation Atalanta. In September 2014, 15 of the navy&#x27;s 22-strong Sea Lynx Mk88A fleet were temporarily grounded following the discovery of fuselage cracks on some aircraft. The German Defense Ministry estimated that the Sea Lynx fleet would return to full strength in early 2015. In the long term, the German Navy is to retire the Super Lynx in favour of the NH90 Sea Tiger.

===South Korea===

The Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) of South Korea took delivery of the first batch of 12 Mk.99 Lynx helicopters in 1990; a second batch of 13 Mk.99A Super Lynx helicopters began delivery in 1999. The first Lynx batch was later upgraded to the same standard as the second batch; the changes included the adoption of a new radar, FLIR, and ESM systems. In 2013, South Korea&#x27;s Defense Acquisition Program Administration announced its selection of the AW159 Wildcat; deliveries of eight aircraft are planned for 2015–16; these will be used for search and rescue, anti-submarine warfare and surveillance missions.

In May 2009, a ROKN Lynx successfully protected a North Korean freighter from being pursued by pirates off the coast of Somalia. In 2010, South Korea&#x27;s Lynx fleet was temporarily grounded for emergency inspections following the crashes of two aircraft within the same week. Shortly afterwards it was discovered that the ROKN&#x27;s helicopters had been victim of a maintenance scam, involving falsified documentation and faked replacement of components; by 2011, 12 employees of two South Korean private companies had been jailed, two ROKN officers were indicted, and several other officers were to be remanded as a result.

In 2024, South Korea approved an almost 2.9 trillion won (₩) program to replace the Lynx helicopters by the 2030s.

===Others===

In 1979, the Lynx Mk.2(FN) entered service with the French Naval Aviation of the French Navy, a total of 26 aircraft would be procured, followed by 14 improved Mk.4(FN)s. Upon entering service, the French Lynx was more capable of performing independent anti-submarine operations than its Royal Navy counterpart, a single aircraft being capable of simultaneously being equipped for detection and weapon delivery roles. In February 2011, a French Lynx landed on the flight deck of a FREMM multipurpose frigate for the first time as a part of qualifying trials. In addition to France&#x27;s own Lynx fleet, French Navy vessels have also hosted British Lynx helicopters, such as during an extended counter-piracy deployment on board the during 2012. In 2019, the French Navy announced plans to retire the Lynx by 2020, and the type carried out its final operational deployment, aboard the frigate , in July 2020. It was formally retired from French service on 4 September 2020.

The Royal Netherlands Navy&#x27;s (RNN) Naval Aviation Service operated fleet of 24 Lynx for a total of 36 years, entering service in 1976 and phased out in 2012 after being extensively used. These performed search and rescue, anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and special forces support tasks while operating from the flight decks of most RNN vessels during this period. In 1993, the RNN fleet were upgraded to a common Lynx SH-14D standard. In 1999, a design defect in the rotor-head used on some Lynx aircraft was responsible for the loss of a Dutch aircraft in 1999; this led to a number of Lynx worldwide to be temporarily grounded until retrofitted with new titanium rotor-heads. On 28 February 2011, a Dutch Lynx and three navy personnel were captured by Libyan forces while performing an evacuation mission inside the country. On 19 September 2012, the RNN performed its final operational Lynx flight.

The Portuguese Naval Aviation of the Portuguese Navy exclusively operates the Super Lynx Mk.95. In 1990, Portugal signed a contract for a total of five Super Lynx, two of them being refurbished ex-Royal Navy aircraft. A total of two Lynx can be operated from the flight deck of a single ; they typically accompany the vessels, including during long distance deployments for anti-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa.
In 1978, the Brazilian Navy became the first foreign operator of the Lynx helicopter, having taken delivery of its first of a batch of five that year. During the 1990s, the fleet was more than doubled by the acquisition of a further batch of nine. During overseas deployments for multinational training exercises and United Nations operations, the Lynx has been described as &quot;eyes and the ears of the fleet&quot;. In 2009, Brazil deployed several Lynx in an effort to locate the missing Air France Flight 447. In 2014, a mid-life upgrade process was agreed for Brazil&#x27;s Lynx fleet, they shall receive LHTEC CTS800-4N engines, new avionics, satellite navigation systems, countermeasures, and night vision-compatible cockpit displays.

The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) received its six Lynx Mk 86 in 1981. 337 Squadron was reactivated at Bardufoss and declared operational with Lynx in 1983. RNoAF operates the aircraft with the Norwegian Coast Guard&#x27;s s. In 2010, one Lynx reached the end of its operational life and was withdrawn from service; a second aircraft suffered a non-fatal crash in 1988 and was totally rebuilt by Westland. The Lynx was to have been progressively replaced by the NH90 from 2005 onwards; however, deliveries of the new type suffered multiple delays, leading to Norway considering life extension measures on some of their Lynx fleet. Lynx was decommissioned in December 2014.

The Royal Danish Navy (RDN) took delivery of eight Lynx Mk 80 between 1980 and 1981. A further two Mk 90 were delivered in 1987 and 1988 as attrition replacements. Operated by the Danish Naval Air Squadron, the RDN fleet is typically stationed upon naval inspection vessels and used to patrol Greenland and Faroe Islands as well as the Danish mainland. Beginning in 2000, the whole Lynx fleet was upgraded to Mk 90B standard. On 7 November 2006, a Danish Lynx had the distinction of performing the first helicopter landing on board a of the Swedish Navy. In January 2011, control of the Lynx fleet was transferred from the Danish Navy to the Royal Danish Air Force.

<doc id="508111" wikidata="Q6843468" url="?curid=508111" title="Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association">
<text>The Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA) is a college athletic conference whose member schools compete in men&#x27;s volleyball. The conference footprint is centered in the Midwestern United States, stretching from Missouri in the west to Ohio in the east, and also extends into North Carolina and will expand into Kentucky in the spring 2026 season. Many of the conference&#x27;s schools also participate in the similarly named Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association in men&#x27;s volleyball at the club level.

The MIVA Tournament champion receives an automatic bid to the NCAA National Collegiate Men&#x27;s Volleyball Championship, which now consists of eight teams playing in a single-elimination format to determine the national champion. The two other pre-2017 major volleyball conferences, the EIVA (Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association) and the MPSF (Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), also send their league tournament champions to the tournament, as do Conference Carolinas (since the 2014 season), the Big West Conference (since the 2018 season forward), and the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (from the 2024 season).

==History==

On February 4, 1961 the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Conference, the nation&#x27;s first men&#x27;s college volleyball league, was started in Lansing, Michigan by representatives of Ball State University, Detroit Institute of Technology, Earlham College, George Williams College, Lansing College, Michigan State University, Ohio State University, and Wittenberg College. The league came about largely through the efforts of Jim Coleman of Wittenberg College and Don Shondell of Ball State University. The league name was later changed to the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA). Over the years, more than 40 schools from Divisions I, II, and III, as well as a couple of junior colleges, have participated as members of the MIVA. The current membership is made up of six D-I (including two charter members) and three D-II institutions, with Lindenwood University and the newest member, 2023 arrival Queens University of Charlotte, having started transitions from D-II to D-I in July 2022.

After the 2025 season, Quincy will leave for the new men&#x27;s volleyball league of its primary home of the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC). Lewis and McKendree, despite being full GLVC members, were not named as part of the inaugural GLVC men&#x27;s volleyball lineup. The MIVA membership will remain at 9 teams with the arrival of Northern Kentucky University, which will launch a varsity men&#x27;s volleyball program in the 2026 season.

Three MIVA teams have won the NCAA National Collegiate Men&#x27;s Volleyball Championship, although only two are officially recognized by the NCAA. Lewis&#x27; 2003 title was later vacated by the school due to player eligibility issues, and the NCAA no longer recognizes the title. Loyola won the national championship in both 2014 and 2015, and Ohio State won the title in 2011, 2016, and 2017.

===Membership timeline===
==Members==
The MIVA comprises nine teams from the NCAA&#x27;s Division I and Division II.

===Current members===
The &quot;Joined&quot; column reflects the calendar year in which a school joined the MIVA. Since NCAA men&#x27;s volleyball is currently a spring sport, the calendar year of entry precedes the first season of competition, except for schools that joined when the conference was formed in February 1961.

The most recent change in MIVA membership was the arrival of Queens in 2023. Before that, the most recent change was the 2017 departure of Grand Canyon for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. The next changes will be the departure of full GLVC member Quincy for that conference&#x27;s new men&#x27;s volleyball league and the arrival of Northern Kentucky, both in 2025–26.

One current MIVA member changed its institutional and athletic identity after the 2018 men&#x27;s volleyball season. Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW), a joint venture between the Indiana University and Purdue University systems, was dissolved at the end of the 2017–18 school year. IPFW&#x27;s academic programs in health sciences now operate as Indiana University Fort Wayne, and all other academic programs transferred to Purdue as Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW). The athletic program was inherited solely by PFW. Shortly before the split took effect, PFW announced that the athletic program, previously known as the Fort Wayne Mastodons, would become the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons.

=== Future member ===
=== Former members ===
Affiliations reflect those for men&#x27;s volleyball, and are current for the upcoming 2025 NCAA men&#x27;s volleyball season (2024–25 school year). Institutional names and nicknames reflect those in current (or, for defunct institutions, most recent) use, not necessarily those used while each school was an MIVA member.

The NCAA&#x27;s top men&#x27;s volleyball championship is open to schools in Divisions I and II, with scholarship limits identical for members of each division. Therefore, this table makes no distinction between NCAA Division I and Division II conferences.

=== Titles ===
==MIVA in the NCAA tournament==
Until 2014, the NCAA National Collegiate Men&#x27;s Volleyball Championship was a Final Four only tournament with the champions of three conferences (EIVA, MIVA, and MPSF) receiving automatic bids and one team getting an at-large bid. In 2014, the tournament expanded to include the champion of the Division II Conference Carolinas and a second at-large team. The tournament expanded to seven teams for 2018 with the addition of the Big West Conference champion, and eight in 2024 with the addition of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference champion.

<doc id="508112" wikidata="Q6408958" url="?curid=508112" title="Kim Jong-chul (poet)">
<text>Kim Jong-chul (; 18 February 1947 – 5 July 2014) was a South Korean poet. He rose to fame in 1968 when he was awarded a prize by the Hankook newspaper for his poem &quot;Sound of a Loom&quot;. In 1970 Kim won another prize with the Seoul Daily newspaper for his poem &quot;Drowned Dreams&quot;. He is considered one of the most significant modern Korean poets.

Kim grew up in extreme poverty. He graduated with a degree in Korean Literature from &quot;Sorabol University of Arts&quot; in Seoul in 1970. In 1997 and 1998 he lectured poetry at PyeongTaek University. He is a member of the Society of Korean Poets and the Korean Writers Association. Among the many prizes Kim has won are the &quot;Dong-Joo Yoon Literary Prize&quot; (1990), the &quot;Nam-Myung Literary Prize&quot; (1992), the &quot;Pyun-Woon Literary Prize&quot; (1993) and the &quot;Jeong Jeong Jiyong Literature Prize(2001)&quot;.

==Style==
Kim&#x27;s first publications generally explored basic human emotions. These are sometimes thought to be typical of Korean poetry. Basic emotions include: disappointment, sorrow, parting, illness, or grief. These emotions are considered &quot;basic&quot; since everyone naturally lives through these emotions as part of their life. This close relationship with everyday life, as well as the subtlety of the emotions are not only a characteristic of Korean poetry, but particularly of Kim Jong-Chul. Kim is considered exceptionally talented at moving the reader&#x27;s heart when writing about these basic emotions. There are critics who argue that this talent can be explained with Kim&#x27;s biography which includes extreme poverty and growing up in war time. Because he was poor, Kim joined the army to serve in the Vietnam War voluntarily.

He continuously showed an interest in themes such as desperation, death, or poverty. Kim distanced himself from these motifs in his second collection of poetry, which had a more light-hearted approach to life matters.

In his third collection, Kim returned to darker motifs. This can be explained by Korea&#x27;s long experience of military dictatorships between the 1960s and 1980s. He describes this time as &quot;a period of universal tragedy.&quot; With the coming of the 1990s, the political atmosphere in Korea changed. This was also reflected in some of Kim&#x27;s poems. It seemed impossible to describe all life in terms of misery and tragedy. Kim continued to recognize the matter in trivial things. He frequently chooses the most mundane objects, such as a pumpkin, a nail or even a grain of rice.

His attitude is often linked with Kim&#x27;s Roman Catholic faith. It is argued that this drives the author to search for the deeper meaning in everything, even if it appears trivial or insignificant. He hints at this in the preface of his fourth collection of poetry. There are some attempts to link his poems with Christian symbols, but this is frowned upon by others.

Kim gives profound meaning to everyday objects. It is this giving meaning to ordinary objects that some people regard as a special ability of Kim Jong-Chul. Kim argues that there is no meaning in the objects themselves: &quot;If all humanity were to disappear from this earth, a diamond would be nothing but a stone.&quot; This involvement with philosophical questions, such as of meaning, is often considered a departure from his earlier works. However, this also helped Kim to be viewed as one of the finest Korean poets of recent times.

Kim has published a number of poetry collections:
* &quot;The Last Words of Seoul&quot; (1975)

<doc id="508121" wikidata="Q1293405" url="?curid=508121" title="Lumbar">
<text>In tetrapod anatomy, lumbar is an adjective that means of or pertaining to the abdominal segment of the torso, between the diaphragm and the sacrum.

==Naming and location==
The lumbar region is sometimes referred to as the lower spine, or as an area of the back in its proximity.

In human anatomy the five lumbar vertebrae (vertebrae in the lumbar region of the back) are the largest and strongest in the movable part of the spinal column, and can be distinguished by the absence of a foramen in the transverse process, and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body. In most mammals, the lumbar region of the spine curves outward.
==Description==
The actual spinal cord terminates between vertebrae one and two of this series, called L1 and L2. The nervous tissue that extends below this point are individual strands that collectively form the cauda equina. In between each lumbar vertebra a nerve root exits, and these nerve roots come together again to form the largest single nerve in the human body, the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve runs through the back of each leg and into the feet. This is why a disorder of the low back that affects a nerve root, such as a spinal disc herniation, can cause pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve (sciatica) down into the foot.
==Muscles==
There are several muscles in the low back that assist with rotation, flexibility and strength. These muscles are susceptible to injury, especially while lifting heavy objects, or lifting while twisting. A low back muscle strain can be extremely painful but will usually heal within a few days or weeks.
==Body weight burden==
The lumbar portion of the spine bears the most body weight and also provides the most flexibility, a combination that makes it susceptible to injury and wear and tear over time. This is why low back pain is so prevalent.

<doc id="508123" wikidata="Q6759414" url="?curid=508123" title="Margaret Floy Washburn">
<text>Margaret Floy Washburn (July 25, 1871 – October 29, 1939), was a leading American psychologist in the early 20th century, was best known for her experimental work in animal behavior and motor theory development. She was the first woman to be granted a PhD in psychology (1894); the second woman, after Mary Whiton Calkins, to serve as president of the American Psychological Association (1921); and the first woman elected to the Society of Experimental Psychologists. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Washburn as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, and Robert S. Woodworth.

==Biography==
Born on July 25, 1871, in New York City, she was raised in Harlem by her father Francis, an Episcopal priest, and her mother, Elizabeth Floy, who came from a prosperous New York family. Her ancestors were of Dutch and English descent and were all in America before 1720. Washburn was an only child; she did not appear to have childhood companions her age and spent much of her time with adults or reading. She learned to read long before she started school; this caused her to advance quickly when she started school at age 7. In school, she learned French and German. When she was eleven years old, she started at public school for the first time. In 1886, she graduated from high school at the age of fifteen, and that fall, she entered Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York, as a preparatory student. This preparatory status was due to her lack of Latin and French. During her undergraduate years at Vassar, Washburn developed a strong interest in philosophy through poetry and other literary works. She also became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, and was first introduced to the field of psychology. After she graduated from Vassar in 1891, Washburn became determined to study under James McKeen Cattell in the newly established psychological laboratory at Columbia University. As Columbia had not yet admitted a woman graduate student, she was admitted only as an auditor. Despite the derogatory feelings toward women gaining education at the time, Cattell treated her as a normal student and became her first mentor. She attended his seminary, lectures, and worked in the laboratory alongside men. At the end of her first year of admission at Columbia, Cattell encouraged her to enter the newly organized Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell University to obtain her Ph.D because this would not have been possible at Columbia as an auditor student. She was accepted in 1891 with a scholarship.

At Cornell, she studied under E. B. Titchener, his first and only major graduate student at that time. Her major was psychology. As a graduate student, she conducted an experimental study of the methods of equivalences in tactual perception, as was suggested by Titchener. After two semesters of experimental study, she subsequently earned her Master&#x27;s degree &quot;in absentia&quot; from Vassar College in the late spring of 1893 for that work. During her work on the method of equivalents, Washburn had simultaneously developed the topic for her master’s thesis, which was done on the influence of visual imagery on judgments of tactual distance and direction. In June 1894, she gave her oral presentation, and became the first woman to receive a PhD in psychology (as Mary Calkins had previously been denied her PhD because she was a woman). She was also elected to the newly established American Psychological Association (APA). Her master&#x27;s dissertation was also sent by Titchener to Wilhelm Wundt, who translated it and published it in his Philosophische Studien in 1895.

Following her graduation, Washburn was offered the chair of psychology, philosophy, and ethics at Wells College, in Aurora, New York. She accepted the offer and delighted in spending the next six years there. While she was there, she made sure to visit Cornell often to catch up with her friends and work in the laboratories. However, she then grew tired of the place, and sought a change. In the spring of 1900, Washburn received a telegram proposing her the warden&#x27;s position at the Sage College of Cornell University. She accepted the offer and spent the next two years there. Washburn was then offered an assistant professorship of psychology at the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio. This position also gave her full charge of the psychology department. She took the job, but only remained there for one school year before becoming homesick. While at Cincinnati, she was the only woman on the faculty.

In the spring of 1903, she gladly returned to Vassar College as Associate Professor of Philosophy, where she remained the rest of her life. When she started working there, she became the head of the newly founded psychology department. She treated her students well and in turn they appreciated her as a professor. A large number of her students continued to advance in the field of psychology after graduation. Washburn published many of her students&#x27; studies during her career. The students would collect and work with the data while she wrote up and published the experiments. Between 1905 and 1938, she published 68 studies from the Vassar Undergraduate Laboratory. These studies were the largest series of studies from any American university at the time. At one point, her students gifted her with a large sum of money and they wanted her to use the money for leisure. Instead, she used the money as scholarship aids for students in the psychology department.

She owned two cats, the first of which was named Hiram. She had a special love for cats, and they inspired her experimental work in animal behavior. When students would visit, Washburn would show off Hiram&#x27;s tricks, such as jumping over a pencil. Reporting her observations in The Animal Mind, she noted &quot;A cat with which the writer is acquainted stands on his hind legs and touches a door handle with his paw when he wishes to be let out&quot;. When Hiram died, Washburn purchased a cat in a New York City pet shop. That cat was angry and territorial, so much so that Washburn closed off more than one room in her house for the cat&#x27;s sole use.

In 1921, Washburn gave her APA presidential address in which she discussed the importance of introspection as a legitimate method of inquisition. She believed that the rising of behaviorism in psychology was overshadowing the legitimacy of mental processes like consciousness and introspection. 

In 1937, a stroke necessitated her retirement (as Emeritus Professor of Psychology). She never fully recovered and died at her home in Poughkeepsie, New York on October 29, 1939. She never married, choosing instead to devote herself to her career and the care of her parents.

==Professional career==
Washburn was a major figure in psychology in the United States in the first decades of the 20th century, substantially adding to the development of psychology as a science and a scholarly profession. She translated Wilhelm Wundt&#x27;s &quot;Ethical Systems&quot; into English. Washburn used her experimental studies in animal behavior and cognition to present her idea that mental (not just behavioral) events are legitimate and important psychological areas for study in her book, &quot;The Animal Mind&quot; (1908). This, of course, went against the established doctrine in academic psychology that the mental was not observable and therefore not appropriate for serious scientific investigation.

Besides her experimental work, she read widely and drew on French and German experiments of higher mental processes stating they were intertwined with tentative physical movements (period). She viewed consciousness as an epiphenomenon of excitation and inhibition of motor discharge. She presented a complete &quot;motor theory&quot; in &quot;Movement and Mental Imagery&quot; (1916). During the 1920s she continued to amass experimental data from around the world to buttress her argument. She remained anchored in behaviorist tenets but continued to argue for the mind in this process. She took ideas from all major schools of thought in psychology, behaviorism, structuralism, functionalism, and Gestalt psychology, but rejected the more speculative theories of psychodynamics as being too ephemeral. In current psychology research, echoes of Washburn&#x27;s insistence that behavior is part of thinking can be seen in dynamic systems approach that Thelen and Smith (1994) use to explain the development of cognition in humans.

Washburn&#x27;s published writings span thirty-five years and include some 127 articles on many topics including spatial perception, memory, experimental aesthetics, individual differences, animal psychology, emotion and affective consciousness. At various times in her career, she was an editor for the &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot;, &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Journal of Animal Behavior&quot;, &quot;Psychological Review&quot;, and &quot;Journal of Comparative Psychology&quot;. From 1909 to 1910 and later from 1925 to 1928 she served as the Representative of Psychology in the Division of Psychology and Anthropology of National Research. She became the 30th president of the APA in 1921, an honorific title at that time. Being president of the APA was one of her dreams growing up. In 1927, she was elected vice president and chairman of Section 1 (Psychology) of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1929, she was elected to the International Committee of Psychology. Washburn was the first woman psychologist and the second woman scientist to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1931. The same year, she served as a United States Delegate to the International Congress of Psychology in Copenhagen.

==Contributions to psychology==

===&quot;The Animal Mind&quot;===
Washburn&#x27;s best-known work and, arguably, her most significant contribution to psychology was her influential textbook, &quot;The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology.&quot; Originally published in 1908, this book compiled research on experimental work in animal psychology. Her range of literature was considerable, resulting in a bibliography of 476 titles in the 1st edition, which eventually grew to 1683 titles by the 4th edition. &quot;The Animal Mind&quot; covered a range of mental activities, beginning with the senses and perception, including hearing, vision, kinesthetic, and tactual sensation. The books&#x27; later chapter focused upon consciousness and higher mental processes. However, the dominant focus of the book is animal behavior. She focused on &quot;the animal mind as deduced from experimental evidence&quot;. She also considered this phrase as being a more accurate title for her book.

A noteworthy feature is the diversity of animal species considered. In an era when animal research was dominated by rats, Washburn references, &quot;not fewer than 100 species, including ants, bees, caterpillars, cats, chickens, chubs, clams, cockroaches, cows, crabs, crayfish, dogs, dragonflies, earthworms, elephants, flies, frogs, goldfish, grasshoppers, guinea pigs, horseshoe crabs, jellyfish, lancelets, leeches, mice, minnows, monkeys, pigeons, pike, planarians, potato beetles, raccoons, salamanders, sea anemones, sea-urchins, shrimps, silkworms, snails, spiders, tortoises, wasps, water beetles, and (yes) rats.&quot; Indeed, she devotes an entire chapter to the mind of the simplest animal, the amoeba.

Also noteworthy is her introductory chapters, which detailed methods of interpreting the results of animal research. Although she was cautious about attributing anthropomorphic meanings to animal behavior and realized that animal consciousness could never be directly measured, she opposed strict behaviorism&#x27;s dismissal of consciousness and sought to comprehend as much as possible about animal mental phenomena. She suggested that animal psyches contained mental structures similar to that of humans and therefore suggested animal consciousness is not qualitatively different from human mental life. The greater the similarity in neuroanatomical structure and behavior between animals and humans, the more consciousness could be inferred. In her words:

&quot;Our acquaintance with the mind of animals rests upon the same basis as our acquaintance with the mind of our fellow man: both are derived by inference from observed behavior. The actions of our fellow man resemble our own, and we therefore infer in them like subjective states to ours: the actions of animals resemble ours less completely, but the difference is one of degree, not of kind... We know not where consciousness begins in the animal world. We know where it surely resides—in ourselves; we know where it exists beyond a reasonable doubt—in those animals of structure resembling ours which rapidly adapt themselves to the lessons of experience. Beyond this point, for all we know, it may exist in simpler and simpler forms until we reach the very lowest of living beings.&quot; 
&quot;The Animal Mind&quot; went through several additions, in 1917, 1926, and 1936 and remained the standard textbook of comparative psychology for nearly 25 years, although about 80% of the material from the first edition was retained in subsequent editions. Compared to later editions, earlier editions extensively covered anecdotal evidence. A chapter on emotions was added to the 4th edition.

“The Animal Mind” was the first textbook published in America for use in college courses on comparative psychology.

===Motor theory===
Washburn&#x27;s motor theory attempted to find common ground between the structuralist tradition of her mentor, Titchener. This focused exclusively on consciousness and the rising view of behaviorism, which dismissed consciousness in favor of visible actions. Washburn&#x27;s motor theory argued that all thought can be traced back to bodily movements. According to her theory, consciousness arises when a motion or a tendency towards movement is partially inhibited by a tendency towards another movement. In the presence of an object, the senses create an impression of it, including vision, feeling, etc. This is accompanied by an incipient sense of movement, either towards or from the object. Different objects evoke different senses of motor readiness. When the object is not present, memory re-evokes those sensations. Learning and ideas are organized in the same way, consisting of an association of movements into a set of regular series and combinations. When two movements become closely linked in quick succession, the sense of movement from the first primes the next, beginning a series. Thinking becomes a derivative of movements of the hands, eyes, vocal cords, and trunk muscles (the thinker&#x27;s pose). In summary:

&quot;While consciousness exists and is not a form of movement, it has as its indispensable basis certain motor processes, and… the only sense in which we can explain conscious processes is by studying the laws governing these underlying motor phenomena&quot;.

Washburn presented this theory in several of her major works, consisting of early papers and in chapters she contributed to several collections, including &quot;Feelings and Emotions: The Wittenberg Symposium&quot; and &quot;Psychologies of 1930&quot;. However, it was most clearly outlined in what she considered her greatest work, &quot;Movement and Mental Imagery: Outlines of a Motor Theory of the Complexer Mental Processes&quot;.

<text>American studies or American civilization is an interdisciplinary field of scholarship that examines American literature, history, society, and culture. It traditionally incorporates American historiography, literary criticism, and critical theory.

Scholarship in American studies focuses on the United States. In the past decades, however, it has also broadened to include Atlantic history and interactions with countries across the globe. Subjects studied within the field are varied, but often examine the literary themes, histories of American communities, ideologies, or cultural productions. Examples might include topics in American social movements, literature, media, tourism, folklore, and intellectual history.

Fields studying specific American ethnic or racial groups are considered to be both independent of and included within the broader American studies discipline. This includes African American studies, Asian American studies, Colonial studies, European American studies, Latino studies, Native American studies, and others.

==Founding notions==
Vernon Louis Parrington is often cited as the founder of American studies for his three-volume &quot;Main Currents in American Thought&quot;, which combines the methodologies of literary criticism and historical research; it won the 1928 Pulitzer Prize. In the introduction to &quot;Main Currents in American Thought&quot;, Parrington described his field:
The &quot;broad path&quot; that Parrington describes formed a scholastic course of study for Henry Nash Smith, who received a PhD from Harvard&#x27;s interdisciplinary program in history and American civilization in 1940, setting an academic precedent for present-day American studies programs.

The first signature methodology of American studies was the &quot;myth and symbol&quot; approach, developed in such foundational texts as Henry Nash Smith&#x27;s &quot;Virgin Land&quot; in 1950, John William Ward&#x27;s &quot;Andrew Jackson: Symbol for an Age&quot; in 1955 and Leo Marx&#x27;s &quot;The Machine in the Garden&quot; in 1964. Myth and symbol scholars claimed to find certain recurring themes throughout American texts that served to illuminate a unique American culture. Later scholars such as Annette Kolodny and Alan Trachtenberg re-imagined the myth and symbol approach in light of multicultural studies.

Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, these earlier approaches were criticized for continuing to promote the idea of American exceptionalism—the notion that the US has had a special mission and virtue that makes it unique among nations. Several generations of American studies scholars moved away from purely ethnocentric views, emphasizing transnational issues surrounding race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, among other topics. But recent studies critique the exceptionalist nature of the transnational turn. &quot;The transnational turn has positioned American Studies in a nationalist rut&quot;, observes Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera, in &quot;After American Studies: Rethinking the Legacies of Transnational Exceptionalism&quot;: 
Institutionally, in the last decade the American Studies Association has reflected the interdisciplinary nature of the field, creating strong connections to ethnic studies, gender studies, cultural studies and post- or de-colonial studies. Environmental perspectives, in ascendance in related fields, such as literature and history, have not penetrated the mainstream of American studies scholarship. A major theme of the field in recent years has been internationalization—the recognition that much vital scholarship about the US and its relations to the wider global community has been and is being produced outside the United States.

==Debate on use of the term &quot;American&quot;==
Until the mid-2000s, the use of &quot;American&quot; for this multidisciplinary field was widely defended. In 1998, Janice Radway argued, &quot;Does the perpetuation of the particular name, &quot;American&quot;, in the title of the field... support the notion that such a whole exists even in the face of powerful work that tends to question its presumed coherence? Does the field need to be reconfigured conceptually?&quot; She concluded, &quot;the name &quot;American&quot; &quot;studies&quot; will have to be retained.&quot; In 2001, Wai Chee Dimmock argued that the field &quot;is largely founded on this fateful adjective. [&quot;American&quot;] governs the domain of inquiry we construct, the range of questions we entertain, the kind of evidence we take as significant. The very professionalism of the field rests on the integrity and the legitimacy of this founding concept.&quot; In 2002, Heinz Ickstadt argued that American studies &quot;should accept its name as its limitation and its boundary.&quot; In 2006, Dimmock affirmed that the field &quot;does stand to be classified apart, as a nameable and adducible unit.&quot;

More recently, scholars have questioned &quot;American&quot; as a categorizing term. &quot;In consideration of the limitations of conventional terms,&quot; Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera argued in 2018, instead of &quot;American&quot;, terms like &quot;spaces claimed by the political body&quot; and &quot;residents of spaces claimed by the political body&quot; would offer a &quot;more sensitive and attuned description... of the regions, critical artifacts, communities, and individuals in question, one that is less charged with the ambiguities and colonial ties that weigh down the traditional disciplinary nomenclatures.&quot; In &quot;the interests of justice and along the lines most suitable to our emergent age,&quot; argued Markha Valenta in 2017, scholars should consider &quot;abandoning &quot;America&quot; as the field identifier.&quot;

==Imperial American studies==
&quot;One of the central themes of American historiography&quot;, argued William Appleman Williams, &quot;is that there is no American Empire&quot;. Contesting such assertions has been a central part of the Imperial Turn in the field. Amy Kaplan maintained that &quot;an imperial unconscious of national identity&quot; lead to &quot;overseas expansion, conquest, conflict, and resistance which have shaped the cultures of the United States.&quot; More recently, scholars have examined how cultural imperialism occurs within the US borders. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera described the phenomenon as an attempt to transition the &quot;cultural symbols of the invading communities from &#x27;foreign&#x27; to &#x27;natural,&#x27; &#x27;domestic,&#x27;&quot; through three discrete and sequential phases:
:(Herlihy-Mera, Jeffrey. 2018. &quot;After American Studies: Rethinking the Legacies of Transnational Exceptionalism.&quot; Routledge. p. 24)

While the third phase continues &quot;in perpetuity,&quot; the imperial appropriation tends to be &quot;gradual, contested (and continues to be contested), and is by nature incomplete.&quot; The Americanization of the continent has been described as a cultural engineering project that strives to &quot;isolate residents within constructed spheres of symbols&quot; such that they (eventually, in some cases after several generations) abandon other cultures and identify with the new symbols. &quot;The broader intended outcome of these interventions might be described as a common recognition of &quot;possession&quot; of the land itself.&quot;

==Outside the United States==
European centers for American studies include the British Association for American Studies, the Center for American Studies in Brussels, Belgium, and most notably the John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies in Berlin, Germany. Other centers for American studies in Germany include the Bavarian America-Academy, the University of Munich, the Heidelberg Center for American Studies (HCA) and the Center for North American Studies (Zentrum für Nordamerikaforschung or ZENAF) at Goethe University Frankfurt. Graduate studies in the field of North American studies can also be undertaken at the University of Cologne, which works together in joint partnership with the North American studies program at the University of Bonn. American Studies Leipzig at the University of Leipzig is a center for American studies on the territory of former East Germany. Founded in 1992, the Center for American Studies at the University of Southern Denmark now offers a graduate program in American studies. In the Netherlands the University of Groningen and the Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen offer a complete undergraduate and graduate program in American studies. The University of Amsterdam, the University of Leiden and the University of Utrecht only offer a graduate program in American studies. Both the University of Sussex and the University of Nottingham in England offer both a number of postgraduate and undergraduate programs. In Sweden, the Swedish Institute for North American Studies at Uppsala University offers a minor in American studies. In Slovakia, the University of Presov and Pavol Jozef Safarik University offer a complete undergraduate and graduate program in American studies combined with British studies. The Eccles Centre for American Studies at the British Library also offers a range of events and fellowships, as well as promoting the American collections held at the British Library. Russia&#x27;s main center for American studies is the Institute for US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

In the Middle East, the oldest American Studies program is the American Studies Center at the University of Bahrain in Sakhir, which was founded in 1998. An American studies program is offered at the University of Tehran within the Faculty of World Studies.

In Oceania, the University of Canterbury in Christchurch New Zealand operated a full undergraduate and graduate American studies program until 2012, and in Australia, an undergraduate major in American Studies and a postgraduate specialisation in American Foreign Policy is run by the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.

In Canada, the University of Alberta has the Alberta Institute for American Studies. The University of Western Ontario has a Centre for American Studies that has both an undergraduate and master&#x27;s program in American studies, with specializations at the graduate level in American Cultural Studies, and Canadian-American Relations. York University offers an undergraduate program in United States Studies.

American studies centers in China include the American Studies Center (Beijing Foreign Studies University) in 1979, the Institute of American Studies (Chinese Academy of Social Science) in 1981, Center for American Studies (Fudan University) in 1985, American Studies Center (Peking University) in 1980, Center for American Studies (Tongji University), American Studies Center (Sichuan University) in 1985, Johns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies in 1986, American Social and Cultural Studies Center (China Foreign Affairs University) and Center for American Studies (East China Normal University) in 2004. These centers do not have undergraduate programs. Based on the requirement of the curriculum setup of the China Department of Education, these centers only have graduate programs. In addition, there are also scholarly journals, such as &quot;American Studies Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Fudan American Review&quot;.

In the Republic of Korea, Sogang University (Seoul, Korea) is the sole institution that offers regular degree program both in bachelor (BA) and master (MA) degree in American studies, named American culture. The American culture division is run by the Department of English along with English literature and linguistics. Keimyung University (Daegu, Korea), Hansung University (Seoul, Korea), Pyeongtaek University (Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), Kyunghee University (Yongin, Gyonggi-do, Korea) also provide a major in American studies. Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea) and Yonsei University (Seoul, Korea) offers undergraduate interdisciplinary courses in American studies. The American Studies Association of Korea (ASAK) is one of the country&#x27;s foremost research associations devoted to the interdisciplinary study of American culture and society within the Korean context.

Founded at Bellagio, Italy, in 2000, the International American Studies Association has held World Congresses at Leyden (2003), Ottawa (2005), Lisbon (2007), Beijing (2009), Rio de Janeiro (2011), The Sixth World Congress of IASA at Szczecin, Poland, August 3–6, 2013, and Alcalá de Henares, Madrid (2019). The IASA is the only worldwide, independent, non-governmental association for Americanists. Furthering the international exchange of ideas and information among scholars from all nations and various disciplines who study and teach America regionally, hemispherically, nationally, and transnationally, IASA is registered in the Netherlands as a non-profit, international, educational organization with members in more than forty countries around the world.

==Associations and scholarly journals==
The American Studies Association was founded in 1950. It publishes &quot;American Quarterly&quot;, which has been the primary outlet of American studies scholarship since 1949. The second-largest American studies journal, &quot;American Studies&quot;, is sponsored by the Mid-America American Studies Association, University of Kansas, and University of Minnesota.

<text>Prasar Bharati (abbreviated as PB) () is India&#x27;s state-owned public broadcaster, headquartered in New Delhi, India. It is a statutory autonomous body set up by an Act of Parliament. It comprises Doordarshan, the television broadcaster, and All India Radio, the radio broadcaster, both of which were previously media units of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The Parliament of India passed the Prasar Bharati Act in 1990 to grant this autonomy, but it was not enacted until 15 September 1997.

Navneet Kumar Sehgal, a retired bureaucrat, was appointed chairman of Prasar Bharati on 16 March 2024, following A. Surya Prakash&#x27;s second term, which ended in February 2020. Gaurav Dwivedi is the CEO of Prasar Bharati, having succeeded Shashi Shekhar Vempati, who served until June 2022.

The Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2021 stated that DD News and All India Radio are the most trusted news brands in India.

== Prasar Bharati Act ==
The Prasar Bharati Act provides for the establishment of a broadcasting corporation, known as Prasar Bharati, and defines its composition, functions, and powers. The Act grants autonomy to All India Radio and to Doordarshan, both of which were previously under government control. The Act received the assent of the President of India on 12 September 1990 after being unanimously passed by the Parliament. It was finally implemented in November 1997. The passage of the Prasar Bharati Act transferred all property, assets, debts, liabilities, payments due, as well as all suits and legal proceedings involving All India Radio and Doordarshan () to Prasar Bharati. 

The organisation began as All India Radio (AIR) and later expanded to include Doordarshan (DD) to provide television services. Finally, Prasar Bharati (PB) was established through an Act of Parliament.

== Composition ==
The Prasar Bharati Act vests the general superintendence, direction, and management of affairs of the Corporation in the Prasar Bharati Board which may exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the corporation.

The Prasar Bharati Board consists of:
*Chairman
*One Executive Member
*One Member (Finance)
*One Member (Personnel)

*Director-General (Akashvani), &quot;ex officio&quot;
*Director-General (Doordarshan), &quot;ex officio&quot;
*One representative of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India), to be nominated by that Ministry; and
*Two representatives of the employees, of whom one shall be elected by the engineering staff from amongst themselves and one shall be elected by the other employee from amongst themselves.

The President of India appoints the chairman and the other members, except the &quot;ex officio&quot; members, nominated member and the elected members. Board meetings must be held at least once every three months each year.

== Strategic interventions (2017 onwards) ==
In May 2020, Doordarshan and All India Radio began broadcasting weather reports for Mirpur, Muzaffarabad, and Gilgit in Pakistan-administered Kashmir during their prime time news bulletins. Pakistan rejected this move, calling it a &quot;legally void&quot; action aimed at altering the region&#x27;s status.

== Reforms in public broadcasting in India (2017 onwards) ==
Obsolete technologies are being replaced with newer ones. Starting in 2017, over 1,200 old analog transmitters have been phased out, and 23 digital transmitters have been installed at 19 locations across the country.

== Transformation of All India Radio (2017 onwards) ==
The number of All India Radio stations increased from 413 in 2017 to 485 in 2021. All India Radio&#x27;s FM stations now reach 70 percent of the Indian population.

== Digital Growth since 2017 ==

Since 2017, Prasar Bharati has shifted its focus to a digital-first approach, yielding promising results. Its digital network now includes over 300 Twitter handles, 190 YouTube channels, multiple news websites, and the NewsOnAir app, which has over two million downloads. Viewership growth of the digital network has increased by 66% since 2017. Digital has now become integral to all Prasar Bharati activities, with over 800 digital uploads happening daily across the network. This ensures that all in-house produced news and non-news content is available for on-demand consumption on digital platforms. The NewsOnAir app has been a game-changer, offering over 270 live streams of radio and TV broadcasts.

Between 2017 and 2022, Prasar Bharati&#x27;s digital platforms experienced significant growth, with many of its YouTube channels joining the Million Club, and several others nearing the milestone. This has contributed to a total YouTube subscription base of over two crore. In 2021, more than 185 YouTube channels from Doordarshan and All India Radio collectively garnered over a billion views, with their total &#x27;watch time&#x27; reaching 94 million hours for the year. In 2021, YouTube channels of both DD News and DD National surpassed 4 million subscribers. Prasar Bharati&#x27;s NewsOnAir app recorded a listenership of over 214 million. Additionally, Prasar Bharati&#x27;s digital platforms in the remote areas of Northeast India achieved notable milestones, collectively amassing more than 220 million views and over 1 million subscribers on YouTube.

== Archives – Preserving India’s history and culture ==

Prasar Bharati&#x27;s National Archives, India&#x27;s oldest and largest audio-visual archive, houses an exclusive collection of rare historical recordings, including interviews, documentaries, features, music, radio plays, and more. It serves as a treasure trove of performances by great artists who have enriched India&#x27;s cultural, music, and dance heritage. The archive also holds rare media assets related to significant events such as Independence Day celebrations, Republic Day parades, national addresses by prime ministers and presidents, and other important broadcasts since the inception of broadcasting in India. These invaluable assets are preserved in various formats, including sound recordings and audio-visual footage across genres like music, dance, drama, interviews, short films, documentaries, and feature films. 

Archival activities in India began with the transcription service for radio recordings on 3 April 1954, focusing on transcribing speeches by dignitaries, especially the presidents and prime ministers of India. While informal archiving existed before 1954, the establishment of the transcription service formalised the process. Doordarshan Archives was founded in 2004 with the goal of digitising and preserving valuable audio-visual footage. Initially, the archival departments of AIR and Doordarshan operated separately under their respective divisions. However, in 2018, these separate setups were merged to form a unified entity, Prasar Bharati Archives, which operates under a single umbrella.

Radio autobiographies are a unique collection in the archives of Prasar Bharati. These recordings feature the audio autobiographies of eminent personalities who have made significant contributions to various fields of nation-building. Beyond offering personal anecdotes about their lives and achievements, these Radio Autobiographies also serve as a chronicle of contemporary Indian history, narrated through the life stories of these influential figures.

In his radio autobiography recorded by All India Radio in 1986, India&#x27;s leading industrialist and former chairman of the Tata Group, Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, recalled his memories of the Emergency era and his conversations with Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi about the excesses during that period. Reflecting on one of his interactions with Indira Gandhi at the beginning of the Emergency, JRD Tata said, “When she declared Emergency, I went to see her. I said, Indira ji, why did you have to put all these people in jail including old people like Morarji Desai? She said, because they were plotting against me. I can&#x27;t have people against me from within.”

In an interaction with All India Radio in January 1986, &quot;Sahitya Akademi Award&quot; winner and renowned poet Amrita Pritam stated that in popular culture, people often categorise Hinduism as one of the religions alongside Islam, Christianity, and others. However, she emphasised that in reality, Hinduism is not just a religion; rather, everyone born in Hindustan is a Hindu. 

This treasure trove is being digitised and made available on the Prasar Bharati Archives YouTube channel in the public interest for academic purposes. In addition to the content mentioned above, audio recordings of around 50 original Constituent Assembly speeches from 1946–1949 have been uploaded to this channel.

Priceless recordings of maestros such as Ustad Bismillah Khan, MS Subbulakshmi, Begum Akhtar, M. Balamuralikrishna, and the epic &quot;Ramcharitmanas&quot;, among others, are part of the Prasar Bharati archives and are available at the counter at Akashvani Bhawan on Parliament Street in Delhi.

== Controversies ==
In 2010, 24 out of the 30 candidates selected for journalist positions at Doordarshan News were alleged to have been appointed based on political considerations. Notably, one successful candidate was closely related to a former Congress Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting, another was the daughter of a sitting Congress Union minister, and a third was a close relative of Union Commerce Minister Anand Sharma.

The number of applicants called for interviews was increased from 25 to 35 to accommodate the daughter of a Congress politician, who held the 33rd rank and would have otherwise been eliminated at the cut-off stage. Another successful candidate, Anika Kalra Kalha, was not even called for an audition or reporting skills test, with the remark &quot;Did not qualify for this stage&quot; noted in the relevant columns. Additionally, the weightage given to interviews was arbitrarily increased two days before they were held.

In 2014, following allegations that Doordarshan had edited out portions of an interview with then BJP&#x27;s PM candidate Narendra Modi, Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar admitted that some parts of the interview &quot;were apparently edited.&quot; He pointed a finger at then I&amp;B Minister Manish Tewari for failing to grant the &quot;operational autonomy&quot; that the public broadcaster had been seeking for years.

In August 2017, Manik Sarkar, the then Chief Minister of Tripura and a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), alleged that Doordarshan and All India Radio had refused to broadcast his Independence Day speech unless he revised it.

In September 2017, following instructions from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Doordarshan put on hold the prime time slots that had been auctioned to Ekta Kapoor&#x27;s Balaji Telefilms and Saaibaba Telefilms.

In September 2017, following a complaint of alleged abuse of dominance regarding infrastructural facilities for FM radio broadcasting, the Competition Commission of India ordered a fresh investigation into Prasar Bharati.

In March 2018, then Prasar Bharati Chairman Dr. A. Surya Prakash stated that the I&amp;B Ministry had been withholding funds from Prasar Bharati since December 2017, and that the broadcaster had used its contingency funds to pay employees&#x27; salaries for January and February.

In early 2019, the Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry introduced the draft &#x27;Prasar Bharati (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Amendment Bill, 2019,&#x27; which proposed granting the Ministry the power to directly appoint the Directors General of Doordarshan and All India Radio, replacing the existing practice of recruitment through the Prasar Bharati Board. The Bill also sought to abolish the provision for establishing a &#x27;Prasar Bharati Recruitment Board&#x27; (PBRB). According to the explanatory note, the PBRB could not be established as required by the Prasar Bharati Act, and the Ministry decided to remove the relevant section of the Act. Shortly after, the notification seeking public feedback on the draft Bill was taken down from the Ministry’s website, followed by a notice stating that the matter had been put on hold until further notice.

In April 2019, the office of then Congress President Rahul Gandhi did not respond to Prasar Bharati CEO&#x27;s request for an interview with Gandhi by DD News. Earlier that month, Congress had submitted a memorandum to the Election Commission, alleging bias in the political coverage by the public broadcaster.

In October 2019, Prasar Bharati suspended an official from the Chennai Doordarshan Kendra, citing &quot;disciplinary proceedings.&quot; Media reports suggested that Doordarshan Kendra Assistant Director R Vasumathi had allegedly blocked the telecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s speech at IIT Madras.

In March 2020, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati declined an invitation from the BBC for an awards function, citing the BBC&#x27;s &quot;one-sided&quot; reporting on the Delhi violence that occurred in February 2020. In his letter to the BBC Director General, Vempati stated, &quot;I must respectfully decline the invitation in view of the recent coverage of the BBC of certain incidents of violence in Delhi.&quot;

In October 2021, media reports alleged that Prasar Bharati was shutting down transmissions from DD Kalaburagi and DD Silchar. Taking note of these reports,In response to these reports, Prasar Bharati clarified that the broadcast reform steps to phase out obsolete analog terrestrial TV transmitters were being misrepresented.

<doc id="508131" wikidata="Q2071287" url="?curid=508131" title="Percutaneous">
<text>In surgery, a percutaneous procedure is any medical procedure or method where access to inner organs or other tissue is done via needle-puncture of the skin, rather than by using an &quot;open&quot; approach where inner organs or tissue are exposed (typically with the use of a scalpel).

The percutaneous approach is commonly used in vascular procedures such as angioplasty and stenting. This involves a needle catheter getting access to a blood vessel, followed by the introduction of a wire through the lumen (pathway) of the needle. It is over this wire that other catheters can be placed into the blood vessel. This technique is known as the modified Seldinger technique.

More generally, &quot;percutaneous&quot;, via its Latin roots means, &#x27;by way of the skin&#x27;. An example would be percutaneous drug absorption from topical medications. More often, percutaneous is typically used in reference to placement of medical devices using a needle stick approach.

In general, percutaneous refers to the access modality of a medical procedure, whereby a medical device is introduced into a patient&#x27;s blood vessel via a needle stick. This is commonly known as the Seldinger technique named after Sven Ivar Seldinger. The technique involves placing a needle through the skin and into a blood vessel, such as an artery or vein, until bleedback is achieved. This is followed by introduction of a flexible &quot;introducer guide wire&quot; to define the pathway through the skin and into the passageway or &quot;lumen&quot; of the blood vessel. The needle is then exchanged for an &quot;introducer sheath&quot; which is a small tube that is advanced over the introducer guide wire and into the blood vessel. The introducer guide wire is removed, and exchanged for a catheter or other medical device to be used to deliver medication or implantation of a medical implant such as a filter or a stent into the blood vessel.

The benefit of a percutaneous access is in the ease of introducing devices into the patient without the use of large cut downs, which can be painful and in some cases can bleed out or become infected. A percutaneous access requires only a very small hole through the skin, which seals easily, and heals very quickly compared to a surgical cut down.

Percutaneous access and procedures frequently refer to catheter procedures such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) ballooning, stent delivery, filter delivery, cardiac ablation, and peripheral or neurovascular catheter procedures but also refers to a device that is implanted in the body, such as a heart pump (LVAD), and receives power through a lead that passes through the skin to a battery pack outside the body.

==History==
Evidence of the game of Mehen is found from the Predynastic period dating from approximately 3000 BC and continues until the end of the Old Kingdom, around 2300 BC. Aside from physical boards, which mostly date to the Predynastic and Archaic periods, a Mehen board also appears in a picture in the tomb of Hesy-Ra, and its name first appears in the tomb of Rahotep. Other scenes dating to the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt and Sixth Dynasty of Egypt show people playing the game. No scenes or boards date to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt or The New Kingdom of Egypt, and so it appears that the game was no longer played in Egypt after the Old Kingdom. It is, however, depicted in two tombs circa 700, because the tomb decorations are copied from Old Kingdom originals.

Mehen also appears to have been played outside of Egypt. It appears alongside other boards displaying the game of senet at Bab &#x27;edh Dhra and in Cyprus. In Cyprus, it sometimes appears on the opposite side of the same stone as senet, and those from Sotira &quot;Kaminoudhia&quot;, dating to approximately 2250 BC, are the oldest surviving double-sided boards known. Mehen survived in Cyprus longer than in Egypt, showing that the game was indigenized upon its adoption into the island&#x27;s culture.

==Equipment==

In Egypt, the gameboard depicts a coiled snake whose body is divided into rectangular spaces. Eight such boards and some fragments have been found with different numbers of playing spaces. Boards depicted in the tomb of Hesy-Ra and on the Causeway of Sahure are also segmented. The board held at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge is unique in that a few of the playing spaces are hatched. Boards shown on tomb walls usually have a large trapezium appendage protruding from their edge, whereas three stone boards from the archaeological record feature an animal head protrusion and two other gameboards are encircled with a goose or duck figure. Finds of lion and lioness pieces are equally rare, but sets have been found in tombs from Dynasty I and are depicted on the 3rd dynasty Tomb of Hesy-Ra. Some are accompanied by sets of small marbles that are usually white but red and black marbles have also been found.

In Cyprus and the Levant, the games take the form of a spiral of depressions, sometimes with the central or outer depressions differentiated by their larger size. These also display a variable number of depressions. The variability suggests that the number of segments was of little importance to the game. Objects associated with the board may or may not be playing pieces. From archaeological evidence, the game seems to have been played with lion- or lioness-shaped pieces, in sets of three or as many as six, and a few small spheres (marbles or balls).

==Gameplay==
The rules and gameplay of Mehen are not recorded, but it seems likely that it was a race game and the objective was to move pieces along the snake track from the tail to the head. Within Egypt, evidence for Mehen has only been found in funerary contexts, and it is likely that the game symbolized the movement of the &#x27;Ba&#x27; or soul of the deceased person through the underworld via the body of Mehen to be reborn into the afterlife from the serpent&#x27;s head, where they could be with Ra, the sun god. A study published in 2024 analyzed the possibilities for game-play in detail and showed that the mechanism for moving pieces around the board was probably &quot;marble guessing&quot;. This works by one player putting some marbles in their fist and the other player guessing how many were hidden - the result would give the number of spaces to be moved along the snake track. The lion and lioness pieces are too big to have been moved along the playing space track and so it seems likely that marbles were also raced along the track and the lion figurines held some other function in the game.

<doc id="508141" wikidata="Q1661230" url="?curid=508141" title="Richard C. Hoagland">
<text>Richard Charles Hoagland (born April 25, 1945) is an American author and a proponent of various conspiracy theories about NASA, lost alien civilizations on the Moon, and on Mars and other related topics. Hoagland has been documented to misappropriate others&#x27; professional achievements and has been described as a conspiracy theorist and pseudoscientist.

==Background==
Hoagland has no education beyond the high school level. According to Hoagland&#x27;s &quot;curriculum vitae&quot;, he has no advanced training, schooling, or degrees in any scientific field. Hoagland asserts he was a Curator of Astronomy and Space Science at the Springfield Science Museum, 1964–1967, and assistant director at the Gengras Science Center in West Hartford, Connecticut, 1967–1968, and was a Science Advisor to CBS News during the Apollo program, 1968–1971. In July 1968, Hoagland filed a copyright registration for a planetarium presentation and show script called &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;.

A popular planetarium lecturer at the Springfield Science Museum, Hoagland produced a program called &quot;Mars: Infinity to 1965&quot; to coincide with the Mariners 3 and 4 missions. He designed a room with special equipment to display the relative positions of the Earth, Mars, and the Mariners during their trip and thereafter contracted with NASA to relay the pictures of the Martian surface, on a near-live-feed, to the general audience. Hoagland co-hosted a radio program for WTIC (AM) in Hartford, Connecticut, &quot;The Night of the Encounter&quot;, along with Dick Bertel, covering the July 14, 1965 Mariner 4 flyby of the planet Mars. Local newspapers had noted the radio broadcast to be history&#x27;s first laser audio transmission.

In 1976, Hoagland, an avid &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, initiated a letter-writing campaign that successfully persuaded President Gerald Ford to name the first Space Shuttle the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, replacing the previously slated name for the prototype vehicle, &quot;Constitution&quot;.

Hoagland authored the book &quot;The Monuments of Mars: A City on the Edge of Forever&quot; (published in 1987) and co-authored the book &quot;Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA&quot;, which was ranked 21st on November 18, 2007, on The New York Times Best Seller list for paperback nonfiction. Richard Grossinger, the founder of North Atlantic Books, writes that &quot;Monuments&quot; became the most successful title published by North Atlantic, and that at its peak the book sold over 2000 copies per month. Grossinger also reports that Hoagland wrote much of the book while in Los Angeles County jail.

Hoagland runs the Enterprise Mission website, and has described the Enterprise Mission as &quot;an independent NASA watchdog and research group ... attempting to figure out how much of what NASA has found in the solar system over the past 50 years has actually been silently filed out of sight as classified material, and therefore totally unknown to the American people.&quot;

Hoagland appeared regularly as the &quot;Science Advisor&quot; for &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, a late-night radio talk show, until being replaced by Robert Zimmerman in July 2015.

While Hoagland makes frequent reference to his receipt of the &quot;International Angstrom Medal for Excellence in Science&quot; in August 1993, the organization that awarded the medal, The Angstrom Foundation Aktiebolag, founded by Lars-Jonas Ångström, was not authorized by Uppsala University or the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to make use of the academy&#x27;s Anders Jonas Ångström memorial medal. The academy has long authorized only Uppsala University to use its medal for the Ångström&#x27;s Prize (&quot;Ångströms premium&quot;), awarded yearly by Uppsala professors to physics students. Mr. Ångström stated in May 2000 that although his award to Hoagland was a mistake, he acted with good faith and with good intentions.

==Claims by Hoagland==
Hoagland claims the source of a so-called NASA &quot;coverup&quot;, with relation to the &quot;Face on Mars&quot; and other related structures, is the result of a report commissioned by NASA authored by the Brookings Institution, the so-called Brookings Report. Hoagland claimed that page 216 of the 1960 report, &quot;Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs&quot;, instructed NASA to deliberately withhold from the public any evidence it may find of extraterrestrial activity, specifically on the Moon, Mars, or Venus.

Hoagland has also proposed a form of physics he calls &quot;hyperdimensional physics&quot;, which he claims represents a more complete implementation of James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s original 20 quaternion equations, instead of the original Maxwell&#x27;s equations as amended by Oliver Heaviside commonly taught today. The mainstream physics community rejects these ideas as unfounded.

Hoagland claims the &quot;Face on Mars&quot; is part of a city built on Cydonia Planitia consisting of colossal pyramids and mounds arranged in a geometric pattern, indicative of an advanced civilization that once existed on Mars. His book &quot;Dark Mission&quot; purports to &quot;carefully document&quot; how &quot;NASA has been quite consciously, deliberately and methodically concealing from the American people and the world for all these years&quot; the &quot;staggering truth ... [that it was not aliens but rather] ... &quot;our own&quot; ... ancestors ... who [eons ago] lived ... and built ... and walked amid&quot; that city (emphasis in original) — ditto the Moon. In the years since its discovery, the &quot;Face&quot; has been near-universally accepted as an optical illusion, an example of the psychological phenomenon of pareidolia. Similar optical illusions can be found in the geology of Earth; examples include the Old Man of the Mountain, the Pedra da Gávea, and Stac Levenish. Some astronauts, NASA photo analysts and others have attributed his alleged Moon artifacts to photo processing defects and grainy/fuzzy spots (susceptible to pareidolia) resulting from excessive photo magnification.

Although the Pioneer 10 plaque was designed entirely by Carl Sagan, Linda Salzman Sagan, and Frank Drake, Hoagland has inaccurately claimed to have co-created the plaque with Eric Burgess, as in 1990 when asserting that &quot;Carl for many years has been taking public credit for the Pioneer plaque which, of course, Eric Burgess and I conceived.&quot; Later that year, Hoagland went so far as to claim he designed the plaque when he said, &quot;Carl... was involved with Eric Burgess and me in the design of [the] message.&quot; Burgess&#x27; account is at odds with Hoagland&#x27;s design claims, stating that &quot;The design itself was created by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, with the artistic help of Sagan’s then-wife Linda Salzman Sagan&quot;, without mentioning Hoagland at all. Sagan&#x27;s correspondence regarding the matter also contradicts Hoagland&#x27;s claims, specifically saying &quot;he did not contribute one bit of data towards the message design.&quot; Burgess recalls similarly, adding that all Hoagland did concerning the plaque &quot;was support me and say it&#x27;s a good idea.&quot; Yet Hoagland&#x27;s website continues to credit him as &quot;co-creator of the &#x27;Pioneer Plaque.&#x27;&quot;

==Responses by scientists==
Many scientists have responded to Hoagland&#x27;s claims and assertions. Professional astronomer Phil Plait described Hoagland as a pseudoscientist and his claims as ridiculous. Plait has also criticized Hoagland for having no university degree. Prof. Ralph Greenberg asserted that the logic of Hoagland&#x27;s deductions from the geometry of Cydonia Mensae is flawed and says that he is not a trained scientist in any sense. The claim that the crashing of the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter into Jupiter caused a &quot;mysterious black spot&quot; on the planet has since been disputed by both NASA and Plait. There is photographic evidence that a similar &quot;black spot&quot; was present in imagery of Jupiter taken in 1998. A second image referenced by Plait shows a dark ring that looks similar to the spot Hoagland cited. In 1995, Malin Space Science Systems, NASA prime contractor for planetary imaging, published a paper critiquing claims that the &quot;city&quot; at Cydonia is artificial, the claimed mathematical relationships, and – very specifically – denying any claims about concealing questionable data from the public.

In October 1997, Hoagland received the Ig Nobel Prize for Astronomy &quot;for identifying artificial features on the moon and on Mars, including a human face on Mars and ten-mile-high buildings on the far side of the moon.&quot; The prize is given for outlandish or &quot;trivial&quot; contributions to science.

<doc id="508146" wikidata="Q785954" url="?curid=508146" title="Vertebral augmentation">
<text>Vertebral augmentation, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, refers to similar percutaneous spinal procedures in which bone cement is injected through a small hole in the skin into a fractured vertebra in order to relieve back pain caused by a vertebral compression fracture. After decades of medical research into the efficacy and safety of vertebral augmentation, there is still a lack of consensus regarding certain aspects of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.

== Procedure ==
 and are the two most common procedures for spinal augmentation. These medical terms are classical compounds of the suffix &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;molding or shaping surgically&quot; (from Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; &quot;molded, formed&quot;) and the prefixes &quot;&quot; &quot;vertebra&quot; (from Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;joint, joint of the spine&quot;) and &quot;kypho-&quot; &quot;humped; stooping forward&quot; (from Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; &quot;crooked&quot;).

=== Vertebroplasty ===
Vertebroplasty is typically performed by a spine surgeon or interventional radiologist. It is a minimally invasive procedure and patients usually go home the same or next day as the procedure. Patients are given local anesthesia and light sedation for the procedure, though it can be performed using only local anesthetic for patients with medical problems who cannot tolerate sedatives well.

During the procedure, bone cement is injected with a biopsy needle into the collapsed or fractured vertebra. The needle is placed with fluoroscopic x-ray guidance. The cement (most commonly poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA), although more modern cements are used as well) quickly hardens and forms a support structure within the vertebra that provide stabilization and strength. The needle makes a small puncture in the patient&#x27;s skin that is easily covered with a small bandage after the procedure.

=== Kyphoplasty ===

Kyphoplasty is a variation of a vertebroplasty which attempts to restore the height and angle of kyphosis of a fractured vertebra (of certain types), followed by its stabilization using injected bone cement. The procedure typically includes the use of a small balloon that is inflated in the vertebral body to create a void within the cancellous bone prior to cement delivery. Once the void is created, the procedure continues in a similar manner as a vertebroplasty, but the bone cement is typically delivered directly into the newly created void.

In a 2011 review Medicare contractor NAS determined that there is no difference between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, stating, &quot;No clear evidence demonstrates that one procedure is different from another in terms of short- or long-term efficacy, complications, mortality or any other parameter useful for differentiating coverage.&quot;

== Effectiveness ==
As of 2019, the effectiveness of vertebroplasty is not supported. A 2018 Cochrane review found no role for vertebroplasty for the treatment of acute or sub-acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The subjects in these trials had primarily non-acute fractures and prior to the release of the results they were considered the most ideal people to receive the procedure. After trial results were released vertebroplasty advocates pointed out that people with acute vertebral fractures were not investigated. A number of non-blinded trials suggested effectiveness, but the lack of blinding limits what can be concluded from the results and some have been criticized because of being funded by the manufacturer. One analysis has attributed the difference to selection bias.

Some have suggested that this procedure only be done in those with fractures less than 8 weeks old; however, analysis of the two blinded trials appear not to support the procedure even in this acute subgroup. Others consider the procedure only appropriate for those with other health problems making rest possibly detrimental, those with metastatic cancer as the cause of the spine fracture, or those who do not improve with conservative management.

Evidence does not support a benefit of kyphoplasty over vertebroplasty with respect to pain, but the procedures may differ in restoring lost vertebral height, and in safety issues like cement extravasation (leakage). As with vertebroplasty, several unblinded studies have suggested a benefit from balloon kyphoplasty. , no blinded studies have been performed, and since the procedure is a derivative of vertebroplasty, the unsuccessful results of these blinded studies have cast doubt upon the benefit of kyphoplasty generally.

Some vertebroplasty practitioners and some health care professional organizations continue to advocate for the procedure. In 2010, the board of directors of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons released a statement recommending strongly against use of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic spinal compression fractures, while the Australian Medical Services Advisory Committee considers both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty only to be appropriate in those who have failed to improve after a trial of conservative treatment, with conservative treatment (analgesics primarily) being effective in two-thirds of people. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence similarly states that the procedure in those with osteoporotic fractures is only recommended as an option if there is severe ongoing pain from a recent fracture even with optimal pain management.

Vertebral body stenting, also known by the brand Kiva, is a similar procedure which also has poor evidence to support its use.

== Adverse effects ==

Some of the associated risks are from the leak of acrylic cement to outside of the vertebral body. Although severe complications are extremely rare, infection, bleeding, numbness, tingling, headache, and paralysis may ensue because of misplacement of the needle or cement. This particular risk is decreased by the use of X-ray or other radiological imaging to ensure proper placement of the cement. In those who have fractures due to cancer, the risk of serious adverse events appears to be greater at 2%.

The risk of new fractures following these procedures does not appear to be changed; however, evidence is limited, and an increase risk as of 2012 is not ruled out. Pulmonary cement embolism is reported to occur in approximately 2-26% of procedures. It may occur with or without symptoms. Typically, if there are no symptoms, there are no long term issues. Symptoms do occur in about 1 in 2000 procedures. Other adverse effects include spinal cord injury in 0.6 per 1000.

==Prevalence==
In the United States in 2003 approximately 25,000 vertebroplasty procedures were paid for by Medicare. As of 2011/2012 this number may be as high as 70,000-100,000 per year.

== History ==
Vertebroplasty had been performed as an open procedure for many decades to secure pedicle screws and fill tumorous voids. However, the results were not always worth the risk involved with an open procedure, which was the reason for the development of percutaneous vertebroplasty.

The first percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed in 1984 at the University Hospital of Amiens, France to fill a vertebral void left after the removal of a benign spinal tumor. A report of this and 6 other patients was published in 1987 and it was introduced in the United States in the early 1990s. Initially, the treatment was used primarily for tumors in Europe and vertebral compression fractures in the United States, although the distinction has largely gone away since then.

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
The cost of vertebroplasty in Europe as of 2010 was ~2,500 Euro. As of 2010 in the United States, when done as an outpatient, vertebroplasty costs around US$3300 while kyphoplasty costs around US$8100 and when done as an inpatient vertebroplasty cost ~US$11,000 and kyphoplasty US$16,000. The cost difference is due to kyphoplasty being an in-patient procedure while vertebroplasty is outpatient, and due to the balloons used in the kyphoplasty procedure. Medicare in 2011 spent about US$1 billion on the procedures. A 2013 study found that &quot;the average adjusted costs for vertebroplasty patients within the first quarter and the first 2 years postsurgery were $14,585 and $44,496, respectively. The corresponding average adjusted costs for kyphoplasty patients were $15,117 and $41,339. There were no significant differences in adjusted costs in the first 9 months postsurgery, but kyphoplasty patients were associated with significantly lower adjusted treatment costs by 6.8–7.9% in the remaining periods through two years postsurgery.&quot;

=== Medicare response ===
In response to the NEJM articles and a medical record review showing misuse of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, US Medicare contractor Noridian Administrative Services (NAS) conducted a literature review and formed a policy regarding reimbursement of the procedures. NAS states that in order to be reimbursable, a procedure must meet certain criteria, including, 1) a detailed and extensively documented medical record showing pain caused by a fracture, 2) radiographic confirmation of a fracture, 3) that other treatment plans were attempted for a reasonable amount of time, 4) that the procedure is not performed in the emergency department, and 5) that at least one year of follow-up is planned for, among others. The policy, as referenced, applies only to the region covered by Noridian and not all of Medicare&#x27;s coverage area. The reimbursement policy became effective on 20 June 2011. A 2015 comparative study of Medicare patients with vertebral compression fractures found that those who received balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty therapies experienced lower mortality and overall morbidity than those who received conservative nonoperative management.

=== Promotion ===
In 2015, it was reported by &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that a person associated with a medical device company that sells equipment related to the kyphoplasty procedure had edited the Wikipedia article on the subject to promote claims about its efficacy. Assertions about the positive effects of kyphoplasty have been found to be unsupported or disproven, according to independent researchers.

His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard is a uniformed service that fulfills six of the nine functions required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO): 
*Search and Rescue, 
*Pollution Response, 
*Vessel Traffic Management, 
*Maritime Safety, 
*Accident and Disaster Response,
*Maritime Security. 

The other three IMO functions; Customs/Border Control, Fisheries Control and Law Enforcement, are undertaken by the UK Border Force, Marine Management Organisation and local police forces, respectively. The maintenance of seamarks is the responsibility of Trinity House (in England and Wales), the Northern Lighthouse Board (in Scotland) and the Commissioners of Irish Lights (in Northern Ireland). HM Coastguard is a civilian agency, unlike other coastguard services around the world, as the duties traditionally associated with a military coastguard service are spread around the UK Civil Service and British Armed Forces. It is a Category 1 emergency responder alongside the United Kingdom&#x27;s regional police, fire, and ambulance services as defined by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.

Lifeboat services are provided by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, or other independent lifeboat stations not affiliated with the RNLI, all under the coordination of the Coastguard. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency wet leases commercial aircraft for HM Coastguard operations — Sikorsky S-92s and AgustaWestland AW189s — to provide aerial search and rescue cover around Great Britain and Northern Ireland, supported by fixed-wing aircraft such as the Beechcraft King Air and Diamond DA-62 in reconnaissance and counter-pollution roles. An ocean-going emergency towing vehicle is also operated in areas not served by tug brokers. On the coastline, HM Coastguard maintains a network of cliff and mud rescue teams, composed of around 4,000 volunteers, and can call upon the National Coastwatch Institution which staffs many former Coastguard lookout stations around the coast. It is part of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which in itself is an executive agency of the Department for Transport.

==History==
HM Coastguard was established in 1822. In 1809 the Preventive Water Guard was established, which may be regarded as the immediate ancestor of HM Coastguard. Its primary objective was to prevent smuggling, but it was also responsible for giving assistance to shipwrecks. For this reason, each Water Guard station was issued with Manby&#x27;s Mortar (the mortar fired a shot with a line attached from the shore to the wrecked ship and was used for many years). In 1821 a committee of inquiry recommended that responsibility for the Preventive Water Guard should be transferred from HM Treasury to the Board of Customs. The Board of Custom and the Board of Excise each had their own long-established preventive forces: shore-based Riding Officers and sea-going Revenue Cruisers. The committee recommended the consolidation of these various related services. The Treasury agreed, and in a Minute dated 15 January 1822 directed that they be placed under the authority of the Board of Customs and named the Coast Guard.

The new Coast Guard inherited a number of shore stations and watch houses from its predecessor bodies as well as several coastal vessels, and these provided bases for its operations over the following years. In 1829 the first Coast Guard instructions were published, dealing mainly with discipline and the prevention of smuggling; they also stipulated that when a wreck took place the Coast Guard was responsible for taking all possible action to save lives, taking charge of the vessel and protecting property. In 1831, the Coast Guard took over duties from the Coast Blockade for the Suppression of Smuggling (which had been run by the Admiralty from a string of Martello Towers on the Kent and Sussex coast); this finally gave it authority over the whole of the UK coastline.

In the 1850s, with smuggling on the wane, oversight of the Coast Guard was transferred from the Board of Customs to the Admiralty. In the decades that followed, the Coast Guard (or Coastguard, as it came to be called) began to function more like an auxiliary Naval service, a recruitment ground for future naval personnel. Responsibilities for revenue protection were retained, but hands-on rescue services began to be undertaken more and more by Volunteer Life Brigades and by the lifeboats of the RNLI, with the Coast Guard acting in a support role.

By the start of the twentieth century, there was a growing sense of dissatisfaction with the service expressed both by the Board of Customs (concerned for revenue protection) and by the Board of Trade (responsible for safety at sea). In the wake of the First World War, moves were made to address these deficiencies. In 1923 the Coastguard was re-established as a coastal safety and rescue service, overseen by the Board of Trade. Its skills in maritime communication (acquired during the Admiralty years, when Coastguard officers often manned signal stations) were recognized, with provision being made for the use of new communication technologies for safety at sea. There was also a renewed determination to recruit, train and co-ordinate volunteer rescue personnel with the establishment in 1931 of a Coastal Life-saving Corps, later renamed the Coastguard Auxiliary Service (see Coastguard Rescue Service, below).

For the rest of the twentieth century, the Coastguard continued to operate primarily out of local shore stations (use of ships had declined after 1923). In 1931 in England there were 193 stations and 339 auxiliary stations; in 1974 there were still 127 stations (permanently manned) and 245 auxiliary stations. From the 1960s onwards, though, priorities were changing from maintaining coastal lookouts to provision of co-ordinated search and rescue services. Old watch houses, with their on-site accommodation and annexed boathouses, gave way to new technology-based Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres, far fewer in number. Efficiency drives in the 1990s made Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard a government executive agency, then in 1998 the Marine Safety Agency and the Coastguard Agency were joined to become the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).

==The Coastguard Rescue Service==

The Coastguard Rescue Service is made up of 352 teams located near the coast in stations around the UK, with the most coastal rescue stations in the UK. The teams are made up of Coastguard Rescue Officers (CROs) who are volunteers trained to carry out rescues and provide assistance to those in distress on the UK&#x27;s coastline. There are approximately 3500 CROs and they carry out rope rescue, mud rescue, water rescue and search duties in all weathers and at all times. The teams are paged by the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) or Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) and respond to emergencies. They also assist other authorities such as the Police, Fire and Ambulance with their specialist expertise. The Coastguard Rescue Teams (CRT) will also provide safety advice to those they rescue and members of the public.

After recovering any casualty the CRTs will provide the assistance needed then will transfer them to a place of safety. The teams will also provide support to the lifeboats and SAR helicopters per tasking by the Operations Centres.

===Search and rescue===

The Coastguard Rescue teams carry out searches of the shoreline which, depending on the team&#x27;s location, could be urban or remote, beach, mud or cliff. The searches could be for vessels, wreckage, people who have abandoned ship, or missing persons. This is referred to as Lost and Missing Persons Search (L&amp;MPS).

===Water safety and rescue===
Due to the nature of the work carried out by CROs they are trained to be safe when in or near the water. They are trained to be able to carry out rescues in extremely rough conditions and the team will work together to recover the casualty from danger while ensuring that each team member is safe.

The training the CRT have will depend on the location of the CRT. All teams are trained in land search methods, water rescue and casualty care.

===Mud rescue===
Mud rescue is described as the most physically demanding type of rescue there is. Mud rescue technicians walk on the mud using equipment to prevent them getting stuck, and recover casualties. In most cases these are people who have become too tired to continue walking on the mud while taking a shortcut. The CRTs also have rescue equipment to extract people deeply stuck in mud, including inflatable rescue walkways, mud lances, and specialist footwear inspired by ducks&#x27; feet.

===Rope rescue===
Rope rescue methods are to recover casualties who have fallen or are stuck on cliffs or difficult to reach areas, be they rural or urban. The teams work together to lower a rope rescue technician who will assess the casualty, provide first aid treatment if necessary and then recover the casualty to safety, before transferring the casualty to the next level of care as required.

=== Casualty Care (CERCC) ===
Each team member receives extensive casualty care training that goes much further than just basic first aid, the course known as CERCC (Coastguard Emergency Responder Casualty Care) is taught by a team of trainers locally around the coast with regular role play training and evaluation. Each CRO is required to have his/her CERCC qualification re-validated every three years. 

The HMCG CERCC qualification is bench marked at Level D (Diploma) of the PHEM framework from the Faculty of Pre-Hospital Care, and is also equivalent in syllabus content to the First Response Emergency Care Level 3 Certificate (FREC 3) level.

In 2017 the CERCC course was updated to reflect and include latest research and guidance such as implementation of the 2015 European Council Resuscitation Guidelines, 2017 JRCALC Guidelines and the British Thoracic Society Oxygen Guidelines. Each frontline Coastguard Rescue Vehicle carries a fully stocked Coastguard Emergency Responder Bag which includes a first aid kit, pelvic splint, frac straps, airways set (OPA &amp; NPA), trauma dressings, airway suction kit + bag, valve &amp; mask set. 
In 2022 HM Coastguard provided each operational team with a Heartsine Samaritan 500p Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

==Role and responsibilities==

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is an executive agency responsible throughout Britain for implementing the Government&#x27;s maritime safety policy. That includes initiating and co-ordinating search and rescue at sea or on the coast through His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard, ensuring that ships meet British and international safety rules, and preventing maritime pollution.

Typical incidents to which the Coastguard is summoned include:

* Persons in difficulties in the water;
* Persons in difficulties on cliffs and the shoreline;
* Pleasure craft in difficulties;
* Medical emergencies on vessels, offshore installations or islands;
* Incidents involving offshore oil and gas installations;
* Incidents involving offshore renewables installations, e.g. wind farms;
* Persons threatening or attempting self-harm in the coastal environment;
* Missing persons on the coast;
* Merchant vessels in difficulties;
* Medical evacuations of injured or ill persons at sea;
* Vessel groundings;
* Collisions at sea;
* Reports of suspected ordnance below the high water mark.
Ships in distress or the public reporting an accident should make a Mayday call on MF radio, marine VHF radio channel 16, or by dialling 999 or 112 on a telephone. The Coastguard MRCCs continuously monitor all the maritime distress frequencies (including the international VHF distress signal frequency 156.8 MHz i.e. channel 16) and have access to satellite based monitoring systems. The MRCC then co-ordinates the emergency response. This normally involves requesting the launch of a local RNLI lifeboat (the RNLI being an independent organization), launching an independent lifeboat, deploying a local Coastguard Rescue Team, or a Search and Rescue helicopter, making broadcasts and requesting assistance from vessels in the area. Depending on the circumstances of each incident, the Coastguard MRCC may also request for other emergency services to be deployed to the incident or to meet other units returning from the incident, for example in the case of a medical emergency. Known as Declared Assets, the most commonly utilised are:

*HM Coastguard&#x27;s own Coastguard Rescue Teams
*Inshore lifeboats, all-weather lifeboats and inshore rescue hovercraft operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and other independent lifeboat stations.
*Other nominated inshore rescue services
*Search and rescue helicopters under contract to the MCA
*Emergency towing vessels (ETV) – powerful tugs contracted to the MCA
*Nominated Fire Service teams for cliff and mud rescue as well as firefighting and chemical incident response for vessels at sea
*Nominated beach lifeguard units

Declared Assets are facilities that have given a declaration to the Coastguard of a certain level of availability or training. Other, additional assets that may be tasked to assist with any incident include; Mountain Rescue Teams, the Armed Forces, local police forces, fire and rescue services, regional ambulance services, and volunteer lifeguards. In addition, various &quot;Memorandums of Understanding&quot; exist between the Coastguard and other emergency services to establish primacy when working in each other&#x27;s areas of expertise. For example, whilst the police maintain primacy for locating missing persons on land, an understanding exists for HM Coastguard to coordinate coastal searches that include the police, owing to the expertise and local knowledge of Coastguard Rescue Teams.

The Coastguard has ten rescue helicopters based around the United Kingdom (at Stornoway Airport, Sumburgh Airport, Prestwick, Inverness Airport, Caernarfon Airport, Humberside Airport, St Athan, Lydd, Newquay Airport, Lee-on-Solent).

==Operations==
When HM Coastguard receive a distress call by a 999 or 112 phone call, by radio or any other means at the MRCC, a Maritime or Senior Maritime Operations Officer will use their training to question the caller to determine the location. The Maritime Operations Officer will normally be able to confirm the location given by the caller if the call is on the 999 system as the equipment in the Operations room will display where it has come from. Coastguard Rescue Teams are paged via an SMS based system detailing the emergency incident, or via a VHF pager, although these are being phased out.

The Maritime Operations Officer will use the correct chart or map for the area and they are trained to ask questions that will help the caller identify where they are. The coastguard SMC (SAR Mission Co-ordinator) in charge of the watch will then decide which rescue resources will be used to conduct the SAR operation. The Maritime Operations Officer who takes the call may keep talking to the caller, while another can be passing information to the chosen rescue resources. These assets will depend on the situation, but could be one of the 365 Coastguard Rescue Teams (CRT) around the UK coast made up of 3,500 Coastguard Rescue Officers, RNLI or independent lifeboats, Search and Rescue fixed wing aircraft or helicopters, or a civilian vessel or aircraft known to be in the vicinity or who responds to a broadcast on radio made by the MRCC.
The MRCC will call out and send the rescue units according to the nature and severity of the incident. The MRCC will then co-ordinate the SAR operation using the Coastguard Rescue Teams, lifeboats and helicopters or other vessels or aircraft, who carry out the physical rescue.

Coastguard Rescue Teams have an Officer in Charge who is responsible for the action of that team or unit, management of the scene and joint coordination of the rescue with the MRCC. If the caller is, for example, stuck in mud, the CRT Officer in Charge (OIC) will coordinate which of the team goes onto the mud to carry out the rescue. If it is someone stuck on a cliff the OIC will coordinate who is lowered over the cliff. All this is done while keeping the MRCC updated of their actions, and possibly being supported by lifeboats or a rescue helicopter. Each rescue resource is able to relay information about any casualty to each other and to the MRCC who retains overall coordination. The coxswain of a lifeboats and the SAR helicopter pilot would be in command of that rescue asset, whilst being coordinated by the MRCC or the OIC.

The rescue resources work together with the MRCC as the coordinating authority to carry out SAR response. Once the persons in danger are rescued the person is then given the assistance they need and then transferred to a place of safety.

===Ceremonial===
HM Coastguard also parade at local Remembrance Parades and selected officers parade at the annual Remembrance Sunday parade at the Cenotaph in London.

==Locations==
HM Coastguard co-ordinates activities from one Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) and nine Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres (MRCCs):

* JRCC UK at the National Maritime Operations Centre at Fareham. Incorporating Solent Coastguard, the UK Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC) and UK Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Centre (UKMCC).
* MRCC Dover, including the Channel Navigation Information Service for the Strait of Dover, and Sunk VTS covering the traffic separation schemes around the Sunk Light Vessel
* MRCC Humber (Bridlington)
* MRCC Aberdeen
* MRCC Shetland
* MRCC Stornoway
* MRCC Belfast (Bangor)
* MRCC Holyhead
* MRCC Falmouth
* MRCC Milford Haven

and one Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre (MRSC):

* MRSC London

All centres operate 24 hours a day. In addition Coastguard Rescue Teams are based locally at over 300 locations around the UK.

===Aircraft===

HM Coastguard operate the following aircraft:

Fixed wing

Operated by 2Excel Aviation:
* 2 Beechcraft King Air B350ER - maritime surveillance, search and rescue
* 2 Beechcraft King Air B350 - maritime surveillance, search and rescue
* 2 Beechcraft King Air B200 - maritime surveillance, search and rescue
* 2 Diamond DA62 - maritime surveillance

Operated by RVL Group:
* 1 Beechcraft King Air B200 - pollution patrol, surveillance, search and rescue
* 1 Cessna F406 - pollution patrol, surveillance, search and rescue

Helicopters (operated by Bristow under contract)
* 10 Sikorsky S-92 - search and rescue
* 10 Leonardo AW189 - search and rescue
* 2 Leonardo AW139 - search and rescue 

Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS)
* 4 Schiebel Camcopter S-100 - EOS, search and rescue 

The coastguard had previously trialed an Elbit Hermes 900 UAS out of Aberporth, Wales. 

Under a 10-year £1.6 billion contract starting in 2015, Bristow Helicopters assumed responsibility for search and rescue operations within the United Kingdom on behalf of HM Coastguard. Under the contract, Sikorsky S-92 and Leonardo AW189 helicopters operate from 10 locations around the British Isles. Ten S-92s are based, two per site, at Stornoway, Sumburgh, Humberside, Newquay and Caernarfon. Ten AW189s operate, two per site, from Prestwick airport, Inverness, Lydd, Lee-on-the-Solent and St Athan. Two aircraft are kept in reserve. All bases are operational 24 hours a day. Half of the new fleet was built in Yeovil, Somerset.

The Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency launched a tender in 2021 for their second generation UK search and rescue aviation programme (UKSAR2G), for an upgraded helicopter, fixed wing aircraft and UAV service. In July 2022 the contract was awarded to a joint bid from Bristow Helicopters (helicopter and UAV) and 2Excel Aviation (fixed wing), worth £1.6 billion over 10 years. The SAR2G service commenced in November 2024.

== Communications &amp; Technology ==

===Communications===
A variety of communication platforms are used depending on the individual asset and situation. Communication involving Coastguard Rescue Teams, inshore lifeboats (operated by the RNLI), other nominated inshore rescue teams and SAR air assets (both MOD and MCA) typically take place over VHF marine radio. Communication between normal vessels and HM Coastguard/Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centres can take place over VHF radio, MF radio and telephone (Satellite, Landline and Mobile).

HMCG have their own VHF radio network spread across the entire British Coast, this includes sites located on the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and Remote Scottish Islands. There are also sites inland to support Search &amp; Rescue in the Lake District. The network is designed in such a way that any Operator can monitor &amp; transmit from any radio site location. A recent upgrade to the radio network has introduced even better resilience and alternative connectivity to ensure continuity of service.

HMCG also have access to and use the Airwave service available to all Category 1 &amp; 2 responders in the UK. This allows better communication between other Emergency Service partners. 

List of utilised communications within HMCG:

* VHF (Very High Frequency) (Primary radio communications method)
* MF (Medium Frequency)
* PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network) (Used for 999 &amp; Routine telephone calls)
* NAVTEX
* Airwave

===Technology===
HMCG has invested heavily in introducing state of the art systems &amp; services to aid Search &amp; Rescue, started in 2014 after the organisational restructure a dedicated computer network was introduced specifically used for operational working. In more recent years a rolling refresh of technology continues to keep the service at the cutting edge of all available technology. 

Coastguard Rescue Stations have recently benefited from the installation of new Wifi services &amp; tablet devices (one per station), as well as new web services for volunteers for communications and training. 

As part of the recent UKSAR2G tender, unmanned aircraft (drones) technology has been provisioned, with feeds potentially being provided to Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres (MRCC) for better incident working. 

==Rank structure==
===Current rank structure===
King Charles III is the Honorary Commodore of HMCG, and wears a uniform with the ranks insignia of Chief Coastguard plus an extra bar.

<text>The Juneau Empire is a newspaper in Juneau, Alaska, United States. It publishes Wednesdays and Saturdays.

== History ==
The newspaper was founded on November 2, 1912, as the Alaska Daily Empire. It was founded by John Franklin Alexander Strong, who would later be the second territorial governor of Alaska.

In 1969, Morris Communications bought the newspaper. 

The paper laid off five employees, three people in the business office and two graphic designers, in September 2015. Several newspaper offices were also consolidated into one location in Anchorage.

In 2017, Morris Communications sold its newspapers to GateHouse Media. In 2018, GateHouse sold its Alaska papers to Sound Publications.

A staff photographer and a sports reporter were laid off in January 2020.

On May 3, 2023, the &quot;Juneau Empire&quot; reduced its print frequency from five days a week to two. The paper has also shifted print production to a facility in Lakewood, Washington and decreasing subscription prices 15-25%. The press, a Goss Community Offset originally installed in 1986, has since been dismantled and shipped to Seattle for storage.

<doc id="508153" wikidata="Q986654" url="?curid=508153" title="Swansea, Tasmania">
<text>Swansea is a town in the heart of Tasmania&#x27;s east coast, on the north-west shore of Great Oyster Bay and overlooking Freycinet National Park. It was the first municipality in Australia to be established after Hobart and Sydney. At the , Swansea had a population of 997.

The town was formed in 1821 and celebrated its 200th birthday in 2021. 

==History==
The first European to explore the Swansea area was Captain John Henry Cox sailing from England to Sydney. He took his ship, the &quot;Mercury&quot;, up the eastern coast of Tasmania. On 3 July 1789, having heard of vast colonies of seals in the area, he sailed along the western shore of Maria Island and into a stretch of water he named Oyster Bay.

Swansea was not settled until 1821 when more British settlers, George Meredith, his family and workers, arrived from Pembrokeshire, Wales. Meredith obtained a grant from Lieutenant Governor William Sorell to farm in the area around Oyster Bay. The land was developed and made suitable for seasonal crops and grazing stock and a tannery and flour mill were established by the Meredith River. Whaling stations were also set up on nearby islands to enable the export of whale oil. Swansea was originally called Great Swanport and Meredith built the family home, Cambria, which is now in private hands. There are other important buildings in the town including Morris’ General Store which has been owned and run by the Morris family for over 100 years. The Swansea Bark Mill which processed black wattle bark was used in colonial times in the tanning industry and is now a combined museum, tavern and bakery. Schouten House is a fine early Victorian colonial house built in 1844 and is now a hotel.

Waterloo Point Post Office opened on 6 September 1832 and was renamed &quot;Swansea&quot; around 1863.

==Notable residents==
*William Lyne, politician who served as Premier of New South Wales from 1899 to 1901, and later as a federal cabinet minister under Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin.
*Violet Mace, potter known for the &#x27;proclamation cup&#x27;, based on Governor Davey&#x27;s Proclamation. 

==Wildlife==
Swansea is home to colonies of short-tailed shearwaters (muttonbirds) and little penguins. The nearby Freycinet National Park has quolls, wallabies, native microbats, possums and Tasmanian devils. Offshore, there are dolphins, whales and seals.

==Climate==
==Demographics==
According to the 1996 census, the town&#x27;s population was 495. Of the population, 25.1% were above the age of 65 – making it the Tasmanian town with the largest percentage of over-65-year-olds.

<doc id="508158" wikidata="Q905355" url="?curid=508158" title="Hesy-Ra">
<text>Hesy-Ra (also read Hesy-Re and Hesire) was an ancient Egyptian high official during the early Third Dynasty of Egypt. His most notable title was &quot;Wer-ibeḥsenjw&quot;, meaning either &quot;Great one of the ivory cutters&quot; or &quot;Great one of the dentists&quot;, which makes him the earliest named dentist. His tomb is noted for its paintings and cedar wood panels.

== Identity ==
Thanks to several clay seal impressions found in Hesy-Ra&#x27;s tomb, it is today known that this high official lived and worked during the reign of king (pharaoh) Djoser and maybe also under king Sekhemkhet.

Hesy-Ra&#x27;s name is of some interest to Egyptologists and historians alike, because it is linked to the sun god Ra. Hesy-Ra, alongside a few high officials at this time, belongs to the first high officials who were allowed to link their names to Ra. However, they were not allowed to use the sun disk hieroglyph to write Ra&#x27;s name. This was permitted to the king only.
=== Titles ===
As a high-ranking official and priest, Hesy-Ra bore several elite and pious titularies:
* &quot;Confidant of the king&quot; (Egyptian: &quot;Rekh-neswt&quot;).
* &quot;Great one of the &quot;ten of Upper Egypt&quot;&quot; (Egyptian: &quot;Wer-medi-shemaw&quot;).
* &quot;Great one of Peh&quot; (Egyptian: &quot;Wer-Peh&quot;).
* &quot;Great one of the dentists&quot; (Egyptian: &quot;Wer-ibeḥ-senjw&quot;).
* &quot;Elder of the &quot;Qed-hetep&quot;&quot; (Egyptian: &quot;Semsw-qed-hetep&quot;). 
* &quot;Chief of the scribes&quot; (Egyptian: &quot;Medjeh-seschjw&quot;).
* &quot;Brother of Min&quot; (Egyptian: &quot;Sen-Min&quot;).
* &quot;Magician of Mehit&quot; (Egyptian: &quot;Hem-ḥeka-Meḥit&quot;).

The most debated title amongst Hesy-Ra&#x27;s many rather unique titles is &quot;Wer-ibeḥ-senjw&quot;, which can be translated in many ways: &quot;ibeh&quot; can be translated as either &quot;dentition&quot; or &quot;ivory&quot;, and &quot;Senjw&quot; as &quot;arrows&quot;, &quot;cutters&quot; and/or &quot;physicians&quot;; thus, the full title &quot;Wer-ibeḥ-senjw&quot; can either be translated as &quot;Great one of the ivory cutters&quot; or as &quot;Great one of the dentists&quot;. If the former translation is correct, Hesy-Ra was a professional ivory-cutter and artist - a profession that was fairly common and already attested in early dynastic inscriptions. If the latter translation is correct, Hesy-Ra would be the first person in Egyptian history to be officially entitled as an occupational dentist.

Hesy-Ra also draws interest because of the richly decorated cedar wood panels and the colorful wall paintings discovered inside and outside his tomb.

On the richly decorated cedar wood panels, Hesy-Ra is depicted in different stages of his life: close to the entrance he is shown as a young man at the start of his career; going deeper inside the tomb, as a middle-aged man at the heyday of his career; and finally, in the remembrance chapel itself, as an old man, sitting on an offering table and being stuffed in a tight gown. The artist of the panels even accentuated the visible aspects of age: Hesy-Ra&#x27;s face changes from pretty smooth to wrinkled and saggy.

The wall paintings discovered inside and outside his tomb are in black, white, yellow, green and red. The figures include rhomboids, stripes and a green-yellowish reed mat imitation. The paintings were in such a good state when found, that the excavators decided to fill the painted corridors with high quality rubble in attempt to preserve the colors. Close-by reliefs reportedly depict daily utensils and even game accessories, such as Mehen game boards and a Senet play set.

Possible contemporary office partners included &quot;Netjeraperef&quot;, &quot;Akhetaa&quot;, &quot;Khabawsokar&quot;, &quot;Pehernefer&quot; and &quot;Metjen&quot;, who were also holding office under Huni and Sneferu. All their tomb inscriptions reveal that the time of both kings must have been a very prosperous one, as both economy and office administration flourished.

== Tomb ==
Hesy-Ra&#x27;s tomb, mastaba S-2405, is situated in Saqqara; it was discovered in 1861 by French archaeologists Auguste Mariette and Jacques de Morgan. Excavations started in 1910 and ended in 1912, organized and performed by British archaeologist James Edward Quibell. Hesy-Ra&#x27;s tomb is squeezed in between dozens of others, approximately 260 m north-east of king Djoser&#x27;s pyramid complex. In its original state, the mastaba was 43 m long, 22 m wide and 5 m high. It was made of hardened mud bricks. Inner and outer walls were once completely and smoothly covered with white limestone. The inner room structure consisted of a long, niched corridor and several rooms and chapels.

*In evolutionary algorithms, the merging two or more optimization techniques into a single algorithm
**Memetic algorithm, a common template for hybridization
*In linguistics, the process of one variety blending with another variety
*The alteration of a vehicle into a hybrid electric vehicle
*In globalization theory, the ongoing blending of cultures
*Hybridization in political election campaign communication, the combining of campaign techniques developed in different countries
