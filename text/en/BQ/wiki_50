<text>The zucchetto (, , , ; meaning &#x27;small gourd&#x27;, from &quot;zucca&quot; &#x27;pumpkin&#x27; or more generally &#x27;gourd&#x27;; plural in English: zucchettos) or solideo, officially a pileolus, is a small, hemispherical, form-fitting ecclesiastical skullcap worn by clerics of various Catholic Churches, the Syriac Orthodox Church, by senior clergy in Anglicanism, and in certain cases by senior clergy in Methodism.

It is also called a pilus, pilos, pileus, pileolo, subbiretum, submitrale, soli deo, berrettino, calotte or calotta.

==History==
The zucchetto originated as the Paleo-Balkanic &quot;pilos&quot; and is related to the beret (which itself was originally a large zucchetto). Clerics adopted the style circa the Early Middle Ages or earlier, to keep their heads warm and to insulate the tonsure. The name &quot;zucchetto&quot; derives from its resemblance to half a pumpkin.
It is almost identical to the Jewish kippah or yarmulke, but typically differs in construction, with the zucchetto made of separate joined sections and color-coordinated to clerical status. The resemblance between the two types of headgear is often seen as being deliberate (a reference to the Jewish roots of Christianity), but the zucchetto is distinct from and predates the skullcap style of kippah and yarmulke.

==Construction and design==


In Catholicism, the modern zucchetto is most commonly made of silk. The design utilises eight gores or triangular panels that are joined at the tips to form a hemispherical skullcap. Jutting from the central tip of the zucchetto is the &quot;stem&quot;, known as &quot;stirpis&quot; or &quot;stirpes&quot;. It is made of a twisted loop of silk cord and is meant to make handling the zucchetto easier. The &quot;stirpes&quot; is the primary visual distinction between the zucchetto and the Jewish kippah.

The zucchetto traditionally has a lining of thin white chamois as an insulator; this is also to help keep the shape of the zucchetto. Inside the trim, there is a strip of velvet to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. Most modern zucchetto designs include a cloth lining, and the contemporary trend is using ordinary synthetic cloth with a simple, natural cloth lining.

=== Colors ===
The color of the zucchetto in Catholicism denotes the office held by the wearer:

* the pope&#x27;s zucchetto is white;
** members of religious orders with white habits (e.g., Norbertines) also may wear a white zucchetto made of wool.
* those worn by cardinals are scarlet;
* those of archbishops, bishops, territorial abbots and territorial prelates are amaranth;
* non-territorial abbots, priests and deacons wear a black zucchetto.

Some Franciscans have adopted the practice of wearing a brown zucchetto to match their brown habit.

The most common Anglican design can be similar to the Catholic zucchetto or, far more often, similar to the Jewish kippah. A form of the zucchetto is worn by Anglican bishops and is used approximately like that of the Catholic Church. The Anglican &quot;skullcap&quot; differs from the zucchetto primarily in that it is made of six panels, bears a button at centre of the crown, and is of slightly larger dimensions. The other exception is that instead of the Catholic &quot;church violet&quot;, Anglican churches usually (but not always) use purple caps on bishops. 

In the Syriac Orthodox tradition, a seven-panel zucchetto called a &quot;&quot; is worn by nearly all priests. It is always black and embroidered with black Orthodox crosses.

==Usage==
All ordained men in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church are entitled to wear the black zucchetto unless promoted to a higher office, and it is worn with either the cassock or liturgical vestments, never a suit. When a biretta or mitre is worn, a zucchetto is always worn underneath, hence its other names of &quot;subbirettum&quot; and &quot;submitrale&quot;.

The common tradition is for the cleric to obtain the zucchetto either from an ecclesiastical tailor or a retail church supply. There is also a tradition of friends buying a newly appointed bishop his first zucchetto.

A lower-ranking prelate must always his skullcap to a higher-ranking prelate; all prelates must remove their zucchetti in the presence of the pope, unless the pope prefers otherwise.

The zucchetto is worn throughout most of the Mass, is removed at the commencement of the Preface, and replaced at the conclusion of Communion, when the Blessed Sacrament is put away. The zucchetto is also not worn at any occasion where the Blessed Sacrament is exposed. A short zucchetto stand known as a &quot;funghellino&quot; (lit. &quot;little mushroom&quot;, usually made of brass or wood) can be placed near the altar to provide a safe place for the zucchetto when it is not being worn.

Prelates often give away their skullcaps to the faithful. The practice, which was started in the modern era by Pope Pius XII, involves giving the zucchetto to the faithful, as a keepsake, if presented with a new one as a gift. Popes John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis have continued the custom. The pope might choose not to give the visitor his own zucchetto, but rather place the gift zucchetto on his head for a moment as a blessing, then return it to the giver. Bishops, cardinals and archbishops such as Fulton J. Sheen frequently gave their old zucchetti in exchange for the newly offered one; Sheen also gave his zucchetto as a keepsake to laity who requested it.

<doc id="497481" wikidata="Q1058294" url="?curid=497481" title="Hormesis">
<text>Hormesis is a two-phased dose-response relationship to an environmental agent whereby low-dose amounts have a beneficial effect and high-dose amounts are either inhibitory to function or toxic. Within the hormetic zone, the biological response to low-dose amounts of some stressors is generally favorable. An example is the breathing of oxygen, which is required in low amounts (in air) via respiration in living animals, but can be toxic in high amounts, even in a managed clinical setting.

In toxicology, hormesis is a dose-response phenomenon to xenobiotics or other stressors. 
In physiology and nutrition, hormesis has regions extending from low-dose deficiencies to homeostasis, and potential toxicity at high levels. Physiological concentrations of an agent above or below homeostasis may adversely affect an organism, where the hormetic zone is a region of homeostasis of balanced nutrition. In pharmacology, the hormetic zone is similar to the therapeutic window.

In the context of toxicology, the hormesis model of dose response is vigorously debated. The biochemical mechanisms by which hormesis works (particularly in applied cases pertaining to behavior and toxins) remain under early laboratory research and are not well understood.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;hormesis&quot; derives from Greek &quot;hórmēsis&quot; for &quot;rapid motion, eagerness&quot;, itself from ancient Greek to excite. The same Greek root provides the word &quot;hormone&quot;. The term &quot;hormetics&quot; is used for the study of hormesis. The word hormesis was first reported in English in 1943.

==History==
A form of hormesis famous in antiquity was Mithridatism, the practice whereby Mithridates VI of Pontus supposedly made himself immune to a variety of toxins by regular exposure to small doses. Mithridate and theriac, polypharmaceutical electuaries claiming descent from his formula and initially including flesh from poisonous animals, were consumed for centuries by emperors, kings, and queens as protection against poison and ill health. In the Renaissance, the Swiss doctor Paracelsus said, &quot;All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.&quot;

German pharmacologist Hugo Schulz first described such a phenomenon in 1888 following his own observations that the growth of yeast could be stimulated by small doses of poisons. This was coupled with the work of German physician Rudolph Arndt, who studied animals given low doses of drugs, eventually giving rise to the Arndt–Schulz rule. Arndt&#x27;s advocacy of homeopathy contributed to the rule&#x27;s diminished credibility in the 1920s and 1930s. The term &quot;hormesis&quot; was coined and used for the first time in a scientific paper by Chester M. Southam and J. Ehrlich in 1943 in the journal &quot;Phytopathology&quot;, volume 33, pp. 517–541.

In 2004, Edward Calabrese evaluated the concept of hormesis. Over 600 substances show a U-shaped dose–response relationship; Calabrese and Baldwin wrote: &quot;One percent (195 out of 20,285) of the published articles contained 668 dose-response relationships that met the entry criteria [of a U-shaped response indicative of hormesis]&quot;

==Examples==

=== Carbon monoxide ===
Carbon monoxide is produced in small quantities across phylogenetic kingdoms, where it has essential roles as a neurotransmitter (subcategorized as a gasotransmitter). The majority of endogenous carbon monoxide is produced by heme oxygenase; the loss of heme oxygenase and subsequent loss of carbon monoxide signaling has catastrophic implications for an organism. In addition to physiological roles, small amounts of carbon monoxide can be inhaled or administered in the form of carbon monoxide-releasing molecules as a therapeutic agent.

Regarding the hormetic curve graph:

* Deficiency zone: an absence of carbon monoxide signaling has toxic implications
* Hormetic zone / region of homeostasis: small amount of carbon monoxide has a positive effect:
** essential as a neurotransmitter
** beneficial as a pharmaceutical
* Toxicity zone: excessive exposure results in carbon monoxide poisoning

=== Oxygen ===
Many organisms maintain a hormesis relationship with oxygen, which follows a hormetic curve similar to carbon monoxide:

* Deficiency zone: hypoxia / asphyxia
* Hormetic zone / region of homeostasis
* Toxicity zone: oxidative stress

====Physical exercise====
Physical exercise intensity may exhibit a hormetic curve. Individuals with low levels of physical activity are at risk for some diseases; however, individuals engaged in moderate, regular exercise may experience less disease risk.

====Mitohormesis====

The possible effect of small amounts of oxidative stress is under laboratory research. Mitochondria are sometimes described as &quot;cellular power plants&quot; because they generate most of the cell&#x27;s supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a source of chemical energy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been discarded as unwanted byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by the proponents of the free-radical theory of aging promoted by Denham Harman. The free-radical theory states that compounds inactivating ROS would lead to a reduction of oxidative stress and thereby produce an increase in lifespan, although this theory holds only in basic research. However, in over 19 clinical trials, &quot;nutritional and genetic interventions to boost antioxidants have generally failed to increase life span.&quot;

Whether this concept applies to humans remains to be shown, although a 2007 epidemiological study supports the possibility of mitohormesis, indicating that supplementation with beta-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E may increase disease prevalence in humans. More recent studies have reported that rapamycin exhibits hormesis, where low doses can enhance cellular longevity by partially inhibiting mTOR, unlike higher doses that are toxic due to complete inhibition. This partial inhibition of mTOR (by the hormetic effect of low-dose rapamycin) modulates mTOR–mitochondria cross-talk, thereby demonstrating mitohormesis; and consequently reducing oxidative damage, metabolic dysregulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, thus slowing cellular aging.

===Alcohol===

Alcohol is believed to be hormetic in preventing heart disease and stroke, although the benefits of light drinking may have been exaggerated. The gut microbiome of a typical healthy individual naturally ferments small amounts of ethanol, and in rare cases dysbiosis leads to auto-brewery syndrome, therefore whether benefits of alcohol are derived from the behavior of consuming alcoholic drinks or as a homeostasis factor in normal physiology via metabolites from commensal microbiota remains unclear.

In 2012, researchers at UCLA found that tiny amounts (1 mM, or 0.005%) of ethanol doubled the lifespan of &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, a roundworm frequently used in biological studies, that were starved of other nutrients. Higher doses of 0.4% provided no longevity benefit. However, worms exposed to 0.005% did not develop normally (their development was arrested). The authors argue that the worms were using ethanol as an alternative energy source in the absence of other nutrition, or had initiated a stress response. They did not test the effect of ethanol on worms fed a normal diet.

===Methylmercury===
In 2010, a paper in the journal &quot;Environmental Toxicology &amp; Chemistry&quot; showed that low doses of methylmercury, a potent neurotoxic pollutant, improved the hatching rate of mallard eggs. The author of the study, Gary Heinz, who led the study for the U.S. Geological Survey at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Beltsville, stated that other explanations are possible. For instance, the flock he studied might have harbored some low, subclinical infection and that mercury, well known to be antimicrobial, might have killed the infection that otherwise hurt reproduction in the untreated birds.

===Radiation===
====Ionizing radiation====

Hormesis has been observed in a number of cases in humans and animals exposed to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation. A-bomb survivors who received high doses exhibited shortened lifespan and increased cancer mortality, but those who received low doses had lower cancer mortality than the Japanese average.

In Taiwan, recycled radiocontaminated steel was inadvertently used in the construction of over 100 apartment buildings, causing the long-term exposure of 10,000 people. The average dose rate was 50 mSv/year and a subset of the population (1,000 people) received a total dose over 4,000 mSv over ten years. In the widely used linear no-threshold model used by regulatory bodies, the expected cancer deaths in this population would have been 302 with 70 caused by the extra ionizing radiation, with the remainder caused by natural background radiation. The observed cancer rate, though, was quite low at 7 cancer deaths when 232 would be predicted by the LNT model had they not been exposed to the radiation from the building materials. Ionizing radiation hormesis appears to be at work.

====Chemical and ionizing radiation combined====
No experiment can be performed in perfect isolation. Thick lead shielding around a chemical dose experiment to rule out the effects of ionizing radiation is built and rigorously controlled for in the laboratory, and certainly not the field. Likewise the same applies for ionizing radiation studies. Ionizing radiation is released when an unstable particle releases radiation, creating two new substances and energy in the form of an electromagnetic wave. The resulting materials are then free to interact with any environmental elements, and the energy released can also be used as a catalyst in further ionizing radiation interactions.

The resulting confusion in the low-dose exposure field (radiation and chemical) arise from lack of consideration of this concept as described by Mothersill and Seymory.

===Nucleotide excision repair===

Veterans of the Gulf War (1991) who suffered from the persistent symptoms of Gulf War Illness (GWI) were likely exposed to stresses from toxic chemicals and/or radiation. The DNA damaging (genotoxic) effects of such exposures can be, at least partially, overcome by the DNA nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Lymphocytes from GWI veterans exhibited a significantly elevated level of NER repair. It was suggested that this increased NER capability in exposed veterans was likely a hormetic response, that is, an induced protective response resulting from battlefield exposure.

== Applications ==

===Effects in aging===
One of the areas where the concept of hormesis has been explored extensively with respect to its applicability is aging. Since the basic survival capacity of any biological system depends on its homeostatic ability, biogerontologists proposed that exposing cells and organisms to mild stress should result in the adaptive or hormetic response with various biological benefits. This idea has preliminary evidence showing that repetitive mild stress exposure may have anti-aging effects in laboratory models. Some mild stresses used for such studies on the application of hormesis in aging research and interventions are heat shock, irradiation, prooxidants, hypergravity, and food restriction. The example of heat shock refers to the proteostasis network. The addition of a bit of stress on the cell can lead to activation of signaling pathways and unfolded protein response pathways that upregulate chaperones, downregulate translation, and other processes that allow the cell to respond to stress. In this way, the activation of these pathways prepares the cell for other stressors since the pathways are already activated. However, too much stress or prolonged stress can actually damage the cell and lead to cell death on occasion. Such compounds that may modulate stress responses in cells have been termed &quot;hormetins&quot;.

==Controversy==
Hormesis suggests dangerous substances have benefits. Concerns exist that the concept has been leveraged by lobbyists to weaken environmental regulations of some well-known toxic substances in the US.

=== Radiation controversy ===

The hypothesis of hormesis has generated the most controversy when applied to ionizing radiation. This hypothesis is called radiation hormesis. For policy-making purposes, the commonly accepted model of dose response in radiobiology is the linear no-threshold model (LNT), which assumes a strictly linear dependence between the risk of radiation-induced adverse health effects and radiation dose, implying that there is no safe dose of radiation for humans.

Nonetheless, many countries including the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Poland, and the United States have radon therapy centers whose whole primary operating principle is the assumption of radiation hormesis, or beneficial impact of small doses of radiation on human health. Countries such as Germany and Austria at the same time have imposed very strict antinuclear regulations, which have been described as radiophobic inconsistency.

The United States National Research Council (part of the National Academy of Sciences), the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (a body commissioned by the United States Congress) and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Ionizing Radiation all agree that radiation hormesis is not clearly shown, nor clearly the rule for radiation doses.

A United States–based National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements stated in 2001 that evidence for radiation hormesis is insufficient and radiation protection authorities should continue to apply the LNT model for purposes of risk estimation.

A 2005 report commissioned by the French National Academy concluded that evidence for hormesis occurring at low doses is sufficient and LNT should be reconsidered as the methodology used to estimate risks from low-level sources of radiation, such as deep geological repositories for nuclear waste.
===Policy consequences===

Hormesis remains largely unknown to the public, requiring a policy change for a possible toxin to consider exposure risk of small doses.

<doc id="497485" wikidata="Q190899" url="?curid=497485" title="Centered hexagonal number">
<text>In mathematics and combinatorics, a centered hexagonal number, or centered hexagon number, is a centered figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in a hexagonal lattice. The following figures illustrate this arrangement for the first four centered hexagonal numbers:

Centered hexagonal numbers should not be confused with cornered hexagonal numbers, which are figurate numbers in which the associated hexagons share a vertex.

The sequence of hexagonal numbers starts out as follows :

:1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, 169, 217, 271, 331, 397, 469, 547, 631, 721, 817, 919.

== Formula ==
The th centered hexagonal number is given by the formula

:formula_1

Expressing the formula as

:formula_2

shows that the centered hexagonal number for is 1 more than 6 times the th triangular number.

In the opposite direction, the &quot;index&quot; corresponding to the centered hexagonal number formula_3 can be calculated using the formula

:formula_4

This can be used as a test for whether a number is centered hexagonal: it will be if and only if the above expression is an integer.

== Recurrence and generating function ==
The centered hexagonal numbers formula_5 satisfy the recurrence relation

:formula_6

From this we can calculate the generating function formula_7. The generating function satisfies

:formula_8

The latter term is the Taylor series of formula_9, so we get

:formula_10

and end up at

:formula_11

== Properties ==

In base 10 one can notice that the hexagonal numbers&#x27; rightmost (least significant) digits follow the pattern 1–7–9–7–1 (repeating with period 5).
This follows from the last digit of the triangle numbers which repeat 0-1-3-1-0 when taken modulo 5.
In base 6 the rightmost digit is always 1: 16, 116, 316, 1016, 1416, 2316, 3316, 4416...
This follows from the fact that every centered hexagonal number modulo 6 (=106) equals 1.

The sum of the first centered hexagonal numbers is . That is, centered hexagonal pyramidal numbers and cubes are the same numbers, but they represent different shapes. Viewed from the opposite perspective, centered hexagonal numbers are differences of two consecutive cubes, so that the centered hexagonal numbers are the gnomon of the cubes. (This can be seen geometrically from the diagram.) In particular, prime centered hexagonal numbers are cuban primes.

The difference between and the th centered hexagonal number is a number of the form , while the difference between and the th centered hexagonal number is a pronic number.

== Applications ==

Many segmented mirror reflecting telescopes have primary mirrors comprising a centered hexagonal number of segments (neglecting the central segment removed to allow passage of light) to simplify the control system. Some examples:

<doc id="497487" wikidata="Q525072" url="?curid=497487" title="Okanagan Lake">
<text>Okanagan Lake () is a lake in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada. The lake is long, between wide, and has a surface area of 348 km2 (135 sq. mi.).

== Hydrography ==
Okanagan Lake is called a fjord lake as it has been carved out by repeated glaciations. Although the lake contains numerous lacustrine terraces, it is not uncommon for the lake to be deep only offshore.
Major inflows include Mission, Vernon, Trout, Penticton, Equesis, Kelowna, Peachland and Powers Creeks. 
The lake is drained by the Okanagan River, which exits the lake&#x27;s south end via a canal through the city of Penticton to Skaha Lake, whence the river continues southwards into the rest of the South Okanagan and through Okanogan County, Washington to its confluence with the Columbia.

The lake&#x27;s maximum depth is near Grant Island (Nahun Weenox). There are three other islands: one known as Rattlesnake Island, much farther south by Squally Point. The other two are near Grant Island. They are unnamed and are located just north of the north-point of Whisky Cove at Carrs Landing. Some areas of the lake have up to of glacial and post-glacial sediment fill which were deposited during the Pleistocene Epoch.

Notable features of the Okanagan Valley include terraces which were formed due to the periodic lowering of the lake&#x27;s predecessor, glacial Lake Penticton. These terraces are now used extensively for agriculture such as fruit cultivation.

== Geographical context ==
Cities bordering the lake include Vernon in the north, Penticton in the south, and Kelowna, as well as the municipalities of Lake Country (north of Kelowna), West Kelowna (west of Kelowna), Peachland (south of West Kelowna), and Summerland (north-west of Penticton). Unincorporated communities include Naramata (north-east of Penticton).

Various lake features include Rattlesnake Island (a small island east of Peachland), Squally Point (a popular cliff-diving area) &amp; Fintry Delta on the west side.

The five-lane William R. Bennett Bridge, a floating bridge with a high boat passage arch connects Kelowna to the city of West Kelowna and the community of Westbank. This bridge replaced the three-lane floating Okanagan Lake Bridge on May 30, 2008, which had a lift span for passage of large boats.

==Steamboats==
During the early days of settlement and development of the Okanagan region, the lack of roads in the region made the lake a natural corridor for passenger travel and freight. The Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service was the main carrier on the lakes, providing freight and passenger connections between Penticton, on the Kettle Valley Railway (the Southern Mainline) and Okanagan Landing (Vernon) for connections to the CPR Mainline at Sicamous via the Shuswap and Okanagan Railway. Smaller vessels such as the SS &quot;Naramata&quot; provided passenger service to smaller settlements around the lake, as well as excursions for tourists.

== Recreation ==
Many parks and beaches are found along the shores of the lake, which make boating and swimming very popular activities.

The lake is home to several species of fish, including rainbow trout and kokanee. It is said by some to be home to its own lake monster – a giant serpent-like creature named Ogopogo.

<doc id="497502" wikidata="Q13075" url="?curid=497502" title="Calcaneus">
<text>In humans and many other primates, the calcaneus (; from the Latin &quot;calcaneus&quot; or &quot;calcaneum&quot;, meaning heel; : calcanei or calcanea) or heel bone is a bone of the tarsus of the foot which constitutes the heel. In some other animals, it is the point of the hock.

==Structure==
In humans, the calcaneus is the largest of the tarsal bones and the largest bone of the foot. Its long axis is pointed forwards and laterally. The talus bone, calcaneus, and navicular bone are considered the proximal row of tarsal bones. In the calcaneus, several important structures can be distinguished:

There is a large calcaneal tuberosity located posteriorly on plantar surface with medial and lateral tubercles on its surface. Besides, there is another peroneal tubercle on its lateral surface. On its lower edge on either side are its lateral and medial processes (serving as the origins of the abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi). The Achilles tendon is inserted into a roughened area on its superior side and the cuboid bone articulates with its anterior side. On its superior side there are three articular surfaces for the articulation with the talus bone. Between these superior articulations and the equivalents on the talus is the tarsal sinus (a canal occupied by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament). At the upper and forepart of the medial surface of the calcaneus, below the middle talar facet, there is a horizontal eminence, the talar shelf (also sustentaculum tali). Sustentaculum tali gives attachment to the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament, tibiocalcaneal ligament, and medial talocalcaneal ligament. This eminence is concave above, and articulates with the middle calcaneal articular surface of the talus; below, it is grooved for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus; its anterior margin gives attachment to the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, and its medial margin to a part of the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint.

On the lateral side is commonly a tubercle called the calcaneal tubercle (or trochlear process). This is a raised projection located between the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. It separates the two oblique grooves of the lateral surface of the calcaneus (for the tendons of the peroneal muscles).

Its chief anatomical significance is as a point of divergence of the previously common pathway shared by the distal tendons of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis &quot;en route&quot; to their distinct respective attachment sites.
The calcaneus is part of two joints: the proximal intertarsal joint and the talocalcaneal joint. The point of the calcaneus is covered by the calcanean bursa.

===Development===
In the calcaneus, an ossification center develops during the 4th–7th week of fetal development.
==Function==
Three muscles insert on the calcaneus: the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris. These muscles are part of the posterior compartment of the leg and aid in walking, running and jumping. Their specific functions include plantarflexion of the foot, flexion of the knee, and steadying the leg on the ankle during standing. The calcaneus also serves as origin for several short muscles that run along the sole of the foot and control the toes.


==Clinical significance==
Normally the tibia sits vertically above the calcaneus (&quot;pes rectus&quot;). If the calcaneal axis between these two bones is turned medially the foot is in an everted position (&quot;pes valgus&quot;), and if it is turned laterally the foot is in an inverted position (&quot;pes varus&quot;).
* Calcaneal fracture, also known as &quot;lover&#x27;s fracture&quot; and &quot;Don Juan fracture&quot;

==Disease==

The talar shelf is typically involved in subtalar or talocalcaneal tarsal coalition.

<doc id="497505" wikidata="Q131266" url="?curid=497505" title="Krems an der Donau">
<text>Krems an der Donau (, ) is a city in Lower Austria, Austria. With a population of 24,821, it is the 20th-largest city of Austria and fifth-largest of Lower Austria. It is approximately west of Vienna. Krems is a city with its own statute (or &quot;Statutarstadt&quot;), and therefore it is both a municipality and a district.

==Geography==
Krems is located at the confluence of the Krems and Danube Rivers at the eastern end of Wachau valley, in the southern Waldviertel.

Krems borders the following municipalities: Stratzing, Langenlois, Rohrendorf bei Krems, Gedersdorf, Traismauer, Nußdorf ob der Traisen, Paudorf, Furth bei Göttweig, Mautern an der Donau, Dürnstein, and Senftenberg.

==History==

Krems was first mentioned in 995 in a certificate of Otto III, but settlement was apparent even before then. For example, a child&#x27;s grave, over 27,000 years old, was found here. This is the oldest grave found in Austria.

During the 11th and 12th centuries, Chremis, as it was then called, was almost as large as Vienna.

At the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Swedish troops captured Krems in 1645 during their invasion of Lower Austria. The city was recaptured by Imperial troops under Hans Christoph von Puchheim and Johann Wilhelm von Hunolstein on 5 May 1646.

Krems is the primary producer of Marillenschnaps, an apricot brandy. It is also the hometown of Martin Johann Schmidt, called &quot;Kremserschmidt&quot;, the leading painter, draughtsman and etcher of the Austrian late Baroque.

<doc id="497506" wikidata="Q3267753" url="?curid=497506" title="ViolaWWW">
<text>ViolaWWW is a discontinued web browser, the first to support scripting and stylesheets for the World Wide Web (WWW). It was first released in 1991/1992 for Unix and acted as the recommended browser at CERN, where the WWW was invented, but eventually lost its position as most frequently used browser to Mosaic.

==Viola==
Released in 1992, Viola was the invention of Pei-Yuan Wei, a member of the Experimental Computing Facility (XCF) at the University of California, Berkeley. Viola was a UNIX-based programming/scripting language; the acronym stood for &quot;Visually Interactive Object-oriented Language and Application&quot;.

Pei&#x27;s interest in graphically based software began with HyperCard, which he first encountered in 1989. Of that, Pei said, &quot;HyperCard was very compelling back then, you know graphically, this hyperlink thing, it was just not very global and it only worked on Mac... and I didn&#x27;t even have a Mac&quot;. Only having access to X terminals, Pei, in 1990, created the first version of Viola for such terminals: &quot;I got a HyperCard manual and looked at it and just basically took the concepts and implemented them...&quot;

Pei released Viola 0.8 in 1991.

== History of ViolaWWW ==

After graduating, Pei developed Viola further while working with the XCF and startups. Later, he would be funded by O&#x27;Reilly Books, the technical publisher, which used the software to help demonstrate its Global Network Navigator site. His major goal was to create a version of Viola for the Internet:

Released in 1992, ViolaWWW was the first browser to add extended functionality such as embedded scriptable objects, stylesheets, and tables. Early versions were received well at CERN. Ed Krol also highlighted the browser in his popular 1992 text, &quot;Whole Internet User&#x27;s Guide and Catalog&quot;.

As ViolaWWW developed, it began to look more like HyperCard:

ViolaWWW was based on the Viola toolkit, which is a tool for the development and support of visual interactive media applications, with a multimedia web browser being a possible application. Viola ran under the X Window System and could be used to build complex hypermedia applications with features like applets and other interactive content as early as 1992.

===Firsts===
Viola was the first web browser to have the following features:

* client-side document insertion, predating frames, or syndication via JavaScript output writing, which are used commonly today.

* a simple stylesheet mechanism used for inserting style information such as fonts, color and alignments into a document. This was implemented in Viola well before CSS was developed in 1998:

* a sidebar panel used for displaying &quot;meta&quot; information, intra document navigational links, and other information, similar to (but not as sophisticated as) features found in several modern browsers.
* a scripting language that can be accessed from an HTML document, such that an HTML document can embed highly interactive scripts/applets. This can be seen as the precursor to JavaScript and embedded objects.

* Forms

==Competing against Mosaic==
While ViolaWWW opened the door to the World Wide Web, its limitations, including it only being implemented on the X Window System, meant it could not compete with Mosaic, the browser which brought the Web into the mainstream. Among other things, Mosaic was easier to install on the computers most people were using. Originally developed for UNIX, Mosaic was soon ported to Microsoft Windows, a platform on which ViolaWWW never ran.

==ViolaWWW in patent lawsuits==

In 1999, Eolas Technologies and the University of California filed suit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Microsoft, claiming infringement of U.S. patent 5,838,906, (covering browser plugins) by the Internet Explorer web browser. Eolas won the initial case in August 2003 and was awarded damages of $ from Microsoft. The District Court reaffirmed the jury&#x27;s decision in January 2004.

In March 2005, an appeals court directed that there be a retrial, overturning a decision that Microsoft pay $521 million in damages. The appeals court said that the initial ruling had ignored two key arguments put forward by Microsoft. Microsoft had wanted to show the court that ViolaWWW was prior art, since it was created in 1993 at the University of California, a year before the key patent were filed. Microsoft had also suggested that Michael David Doyle, Eolas&#x27; founder and a former University of California researcher, had intentionally concealed his knowledge of ViolaWWW when filing the patent claim. Microsoft subsequently settled with Eolas, in August 2007, without a retrial. Eolas continued to file suits against dozens of other technology companies.

In February 2012 a Texas jury found that two of Eolas&#x27; patents were invalid after testimony from several defendants including Tim Berners-Lee and Pei-Yuan Wei, credited as creator of the Viola browser. The testimony professed that the Viola browser included Eolas&#x27; claimed inventions before the filing date (September 7, 1993). There is &quot;substantial evidence that Viola was publicly known and used&quot; before the plaintiffs&#x27; alleged conception date, it added. The ruling effectively ended a pending lawsuit against 22 companies including Yahoo, Google, and many online retailers.

<text>Kenneth Rafe Mair (31 December 1931 – 9 October 2017) was a Canadian lawyer, political commentator, radio personality and politician in British Columbia, Canada. He served in the British Columbia Legislative Assembly as the member for Kamloops from 1975 to 1981 in the caucus of the Social Credit Party.

In his post-political career, Mair became a radio personality and political commentator, raising controversy for his views on both the Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional accords. He served as the plaintiff of the historic Supreme Court of Canada decision &quot;Rafe Mair v. Kari Simpson&quot;.

==Early life==
Mair was born in Vancouver and grew up in the neighbourhood of Kerrisdale. His mother was Frances Tyne (née Leigh), known as Frankie, and his father was Kenneth Frederick Robert Mair, a salesman born in Auckland, New Zealand, and his brother Leigh, in 1936. They had married in Vancouver 16 months earlier.

Mair became an avid fisherman and developed an interest in public affairs from his mother&#x27;s work at &quot;The Province&quot; newspaper.

Mair entered the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1949 and went on to law in 1953. He worked for a lumber company and then in the oil industry in Edmonton before spending three years as a claims adjuster with an insurance company.

In 1960, Mair began articling with Vancouver lawyer Tom Griffiths. Called to the bar in 1961, he handled many personal injury cases. He practiced law in Vancouver until 1968, when he moved to Kamloops to join the practice of his law school classmate Jarl Whist, a Liberal who had run twice unsuccessfully against Progressive Conservative MP E. Davie Fulton.

== Political career ==
His electoral career began with his election to Kamloops city council in the early 1970s. Previously involved with the Liberal Party, he was an opponent of the NDP government of premier Dave Barrett. He won the Social Credit nomination for Kamloops in May 1975, going on to defeat NDP incumbent Gerry Anderson in the December election by 14,639 votes to 10,975. Mair won re-election four years later by 3,309 votes. He held the seat until retiring from politics in 1981; the seat was taken over by Claude Richmond, also of the Social Credit Party.

Mair served in Premier Bill Bennett&#x27;s cabinet in a variety of portfolios, including health, environment, consumer services, and consumer and corporate affairs. During the negotiations in 1980 and 1981 to patriate the Constitution of Canada, he was BC&#x27;s chief delegate on constitutional matters.

== Media personality ==
In 1981, Mair left government and served as a radio talk show host in Vancouver at CJOR. The station fired Mair in 1984, replacing him with former premier Dave Barrett. Mair moved to rival CKNW.

In the early 1990s, he gained national notoriety and support alike for his role as an outspoken opponent of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional accords.

Despite high ratings, his show was cancelled by CKNW in 2003, and he was subsequently hired at CKBD (600 AM), an oldies station, to start a morning talk show until the show&#x27;s ending in 2005. In the fall of 2005, he became a regular commentary guest on Omni Television&#x27;s prime time current affairs program, &quot;The Standard&quot; (seen in Vancouver on CHNU-TV).

Mair contributed three commentaries a week until January 2006 when the Commentary segment of the program was axed. However, he continued his relationship with &quot;The Standard&quot;, guest-hosting the program from time to time. Until his death, he was as a regular columnist for a chain of community newspapers as well as for the online magazine &quot;The Tyee&quot; and often appeared nationally as a political commentator for several outlets including CBC Radio.

In 2008, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled in Mair&#x27;s favour in &quot;Rafe Mair v. Kari Simpson&quot;, his appeal against a provincial court decision that he had defamed social activist Kari Simpson in his editorial in 1999.

== Views ==
Although he was traditionally considered a political conservative, Mair&#x27;s views were moderate on certain issues; notably the environment and social welfare. Disillusioned with the three mainstream federal parties, he became a significant supporter of the Green Party urging people to vote for them in recent federal and provincial elections. Though he shied away from endorsing entire parties, he supported individual candidates, such as New Democrat candidate Svend Robinson in Vancouver Centre.

In 2009, Mair publicly stated that he voted NDP in that year&#x27;s election. He had written why he thought that Premier Gordon Campbell failed British Columbians; among the reasons he cited were that the BC Liberals were destroying the publicly owned utility, BC Hydro, and were giving away British Columbia&#x27;s water rights to international corporate interests.

Mair was the spokesperson for Save Our Rivers, a group organized to fight private run-of-the-river hydroelectric developments.

==Personal life==
Mair was a Type II diabetic and publicly announced his experiences with depression in 1995 while working as a broadcaster.

Mair authored several books on Canadian politics, including his memoirs, and was a regular columnist at the online newsmagazine &quot;The Tyee&quot;. He was a principal contributor until his death to &quot;The Common Sense Canadian&quot;, a news and opinion site with a British Columbia focus. He hosted a program called &quot;The Search with Rafe Mair&quot; on Joytv.

Mair died on 9 October 2017 in Vancouver at the age of 85.

<doc id="497524" wikidata="Q19475336" url="?curid=497524" title="Midgar">
<text>is a fictional city from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; media franchise. It first appears in the 1997 video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and is depicted as a bustling metropolis built, occupied, and controlled by the megacorporation . The city is powered by electricity drawn from reactors which run on , the processed form of spiritual energy extracted by Shinra from beneath the surface of the planet on which the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; takes place. Shinra&#x27;s activities drain the world of its life force, the &quot;Lifestream&quot;, threatening the existence of all life as the planet weakens. In spin-offs of the game, the city spanned a town named .

Midgar is a major aspect of the metaseries&#x27; industrial or post-industrial science fiction milieu with recurring appearances in related media, and is the centerpiece of &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;. Midgar is considered to be one of the most memorable aspects of the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and has been well received by critics and the video game community for its cyberpunk aesthetic and dystopian setting. Midgar is featured prominently in discussions about &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; themes of class conflict and environmentalism.

==Development==
&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was originally envisioned to be set in an alternate version of New York City, before the development team decided to switch to the fictional city of Midgar. Yusuke Naora, the art director for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, designed many of the locations for the game. Contrary to popular belief that Midgar&#x27;s steampunk aesthetic is influenced by works such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, Naora said that he had the image of a pizza in mind when he originally designed Midgar and its distinctive plate-like structure. Other in-game elements themed after pizza include Midgar&#x27;s mayor Domino and the musical theme &quot;Underneath the Rotting Pizza&quot;, which plays in various Midgar levels. Like other story elements in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Midgar&#x27;s name is inspired by Norse mythology.

The 2020 video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; focuses on the city of Midgar due to it being a highly recognizable symbol of the world of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. The iteration of Midgar for &quot;Remake&quot; had to be redesigned from scratch, as the process of converting the original&#x27;s 2D backgrounds into a 3D space reveal many &quot;structural contradictions&quot;. The planning process began with Midgar&#x27;s original design, and from there, the team created architectural documents outlining how its various aspects should work. The development team aimed to make Midgar&#x27;s environments larger and denser while taking into consideration their functionality, as they wanted to expand the city in a way that made sense. The developers set out to make Midgar&#x27;s environments realistic by adjusting its scale regarding the size between the buildings and the density. In &quot;Remake&quot;, Midgar&#x27;s sights and locales references different types of world architecture and channel these influences through the developers&#x27; use of materials, light, and space. For example, the city&#x27;s bus signs heavily resemble their real-world counterparts in New York City. &quot;Remake&quot; producer Yoshinori Kitase noted that the developmental team wanted to show a different design aesthetic which presents Midgar with strong elements of colour and variety, and the lighting and colouring used in &quot;Remake&quot; is intended to accentuate the uniqueness of the game world. The development team opted not to use a &quot;photo-realistic approach&quot;, but instead something more stylized to honor the artistic designs and choices of the original game. Environment director on &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; Takako Miyake noted that whenever the team extracted Midgar&#x27;s design elements from the original, they were &quot;focused on combinations that unconditionally inspired excitement, consistency aside&quot;. In retrospect, the team praised Midgar&#x27;s eclectic aesthetic from the original game, as they felt it was the most captivating aspect of its setting, and felt that it is important to ensure each area felt distinct to prevent it from becoming monotonous.

The developers of &quot;Remake&quot; wanted to show more of the lives of Midgar&#x27;s ordinary citizens to give players a better sense of it and its culture, which is why they expanded the roles of previously minor characters. The original game opens with Cloud&#x27;s first bombing mission with AVALANCHE, as the intention at the time was to start the game in the middle of the action. &quot;Remake&quot; instead opens with mundane scenes of everyday life for Midgar&#x27;s citizens, as it developers felt that going straight from the bombing mission into the streets was insufficient to convey the impact the destruction of Mako reactors has on people&#x27;s lives. The developers also wanted to add nuance to the events before and after the explosion of the Mako reactor by making players question AVALANCHE&#x27;s eco-terrorist activities and emphasizing that innocent people suffer regardless of who is responsible for the chaos following the reactor&#x27;s destruction.

Director Tetsuya Nomura acknowledged that concerns were raised regarding the scope of &quot;Remake&quot;, but did not feel that expansion of Midgar as a setting would be problematic. He explained that while it takes about seven hours to go through the Midgar section in the original game, he said the overall gameplay of &quot;Remake&quot;, when taking into consideration travel time involved with traversing a fully three-dimensional map in Midgar along with expanded story content, is enough to cover an entire game. The story and scenario writer for &quot;Remake&quot;, Kazushige Nojima, said that stopping the game at the point the party departs Midgar would also allow for an adequate amount of planned story scenarios to be incorporated throughout its narrative.

Midgar is located on a world referred to as &quot;the Planet&quot; by the characters, and which is retroactively named &quot;Gaia&quot; in some Square Enix promotional material and by Square Enix staff. Midgar is originally formed from the consolidation of several smaller, independent towns in the distant past; each settlement made up one sector and gradually lost its original name. The city is ruled by the Shinra Electric Power Company and powered by Shinra&#x27;s &quot;Mako&quot; reactors. The city has two principal components: an elevated, circular plate supported by a central pillar and a system of smaller columns, and a network of slums beneath the plate. The upper plate contains office buildings and similar complexes, as well as theatres, bars and various residences. The plate is divided into eight sectors, with each sector punctuated by two walls and a Mako reactor. The city&#x27;s prosperity is due to the abundance of Mako energy near it, and the reactor complex meaning that there is little to no vegetation within or near it. A commuter railway system carries workers to and from the slums, and security measures are implemented throughout the city. A network of maintenance platforms are suspended beneath the plate. Many citizens live in the slums beneath the sections of the plate. Most buildings there are made of collected scrap shaped into dwellings; most lack architectural planning, with the slums as a whole littered with wreckage.

At some point in its history, Midgar went to war with the nation of Wutai. Shinra developed a means of mass-producing and weaponizing &quot;materia&quot;, small spheres of crystallized Mako energy that grant their user magical abilities, as well as an army of genetically enhanced elite military units called &quot;SOLDIER&quot;. Shinra ultimately won the war and established Midgar as their seat of power and influence in the wider world by the events of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. At one point, Shinra had developed a space exploration program, but following the war with Wutai and the discovery of how profitable processing Mako energy was, Shinra prioritized research on Mako and its applications and consolidated their operations around harvesting Mako energy, effectively cancelling the program.

==Level content==
In &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and spin-off media, player characters may visit multiple sectors within Midgar. Noteworthy sectors include:

* The Sector 5 slums, home of Aerith Gainsborough and her adoptive mother, Elmyra Gainsborough. A disused church tended to by Aerith and the area adjacent to Elmyra&#x27;s house are among the few places with greenery in the city. 
* The Sector 6 slums, a broken-down passageway between Sectors 5 and 7. Wall Market is its largest and most populated area and serves as a red light district. Noteworthy locations include the Honeybee Inn and Don Corneo&#x27;s mansion.
* The Sector 7 slums, where AVALANCHE is headquartered in a bar called &quot;7th Heaven&quot; run by Tifa Lockhart. Inside the Sector 7 slums is the Train Graveyard, a dark and dangerous area of scrapped trains resembling a maze.
* Sector 0, which contains Shinra&#x27;s headquarters, a massive building located in the center column of the upper plate which is the tallest structure in Midgar. From their offices, Shinra staff run almost every element of Midgar, from the news media to the reactors that power the metropolis.

====&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;====
Midgar serves as the setting of the opening section of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. The eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, with assistance from Cloud Strife, engineered successful bombing missions that temporarily put two Mako reactors out of commission by the events of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. In retaliation, the Turks destroyed the pillar holding up the section of the upper plate above Sector 7&#x27;s slums. This caused the plate to collapse and crush the slums below, killing many residents. Shinra executives, hoping that all of AVALANCHE&#x27;s members would be killed in the incident, blamed it on them to sway public opinion against them.

Following Shinra&#x27;s capture of Cloud&#x27;s party during their raid on the company&#x27;s headquarters, President Shinra reveals his desire to discover the supposed Promised Land, where a &quot;Neo-Midgar&quot; would be built. He claims this land would be so abundant in Mako that it would flow out of the ground without needing Mako reactors to siphon it, which would increase Shinra&#x27;s profits exponentially.

Some time later, Shinra moves a large Mako-powered cannon from a military installation in Junon to Midgar. It is modified into a superweapon called &quot;the Sister Ray&quot; through its integration with the city&#x27;s Mako reactor network, with the goal of destroying an energy barrier Sephiroth conjured to protect himself in the Northern Crater after summoning the planet-destroying spell &quot;Meteor&quot;. The cannon succeeds, but a simultaneous attack by a rampaging Weapon damages some areas of Midgar and destroys the upper floors of the Shinra headquarters. At the same time, Cloud&#x27;s party infiltrate the city, defeating several of Shinra&#x27;s remaining Shinra and disabling the Sister Ray, which is on the verge of destroying the city due to a power overload incited by Professor Hojo, the head of Shinra&#x27;s Science Department.

The game&#x27;s ending cutscene reveals that the Meteor nearly destroyed Midgar, but it is stopped by the combined effort of a Holy spell summoned by Aerith and the planet&#x27;s Lifestream. In a post-credits scene set five hundred years later, Midgar is shown to be abandoned and overgrown with greenery.

====&quot;Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII&quot;====
In the prequel &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, Midgar experiences an insurgency waged by an earlier iteration of AVALANCHE. The story follows several Turk operatives working with Shinra&#x27;s armed forces to combat the threat. During the game&#x27;s events, Midgar is nearly destroyed by the large cannon stationed at Junon, which AVALANCHE had temporarily seized. Eventually, the original incarnation of AVALANCHE was crushed and its name was taken up by a new group that only consisted of a handful of operatives.

====&quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot;====
&quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; reveals that while Reeve Tuesti, Yuffie Kisaragi, Vincent Valentine and the Turks managed to evacuate the populace of the upper plate to Midgar&#x27;s slum sectors prior to the ending of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, storms spawned by the intense gravity generated between Meteor and the Planet tore apart several of the city&#x27;s upper plates. The main antagonistic faction of &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; is Deepground, a SOLDIER sect developed as an experimental military project by President Shinra prior to his death. Trapped deep underground in Midgar by the effects of the Meteor crisis, Midgar becomes a battlefield during the events of &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; as the World Restoration Organization (WRO), led by Reeve Tuesti, battles the re-emerged Deepground forces.

====&quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;====
&quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, the first in a planned series of games remaking &#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, is set in Midgar. The narrative of &quot;Remake&quot; covers the beginning of the original game to the escape from Midgar by the surviving members of AVALANCHE and their allies with expanded story content. The setting of Midgar in &quot;Remake&quot; is noted for its linear nature; while the upper plate regions were mostly inaccessible in the original game, &quot;Remake&quot; allows players to explore many of these areas and interact extensively with its residents through new story scenarios.

====Other games====
Midgar has appeared as a level or stage in various &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-off titles outside of the &quot;Compilation&quot; metaseries. These include &quot;Final Fantasy VII G-Bike&quot;; &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; and its sequels &quot;Dissidia 012&quot; and &quot;Dissidia NT&quot;; &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot; and its sequel &quot;Curtain Call&quot;; and &quot;Final Fantasy Airborne Brigade&quot;.

Outside of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, Midgar has appeared in the &quot;Itadaki Street&quot; series, the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, &quot;Rampage Land Rankers&quot;, and &quot;PowerWash Simulator&quot;.
===Other media===
&quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot; expands upon the original ending of &quot;VII&quot;, and reveals that the survivors of Midgar used debris from the city to build a new town called &quot;Edge&quot; on the outskirts of Midgar, though much of the population suffer from a plague known as &quot;Geostigma&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
Julie Muncy from &quot;Wired&quot; noted that the city of Midgar, along with characters like Cloud Strife and Sephiroth, have achieved a level of cultural impact far beyond the games they originate from and &quot;exist with power outside of their context&quot;. Stephen K. Hirst from &quot;Ars Technica&quot; suggested that a major theme of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which involves an armed struggle between members of the working class and a &quot;hyper-capitalist machine hellbent on extracting every ounce of value from the planet&quot; to benefit Midgar&#x27;s elite, resonated with a generation of players and inspired some to become environmentalist advocates and activists. The city is the namesake and inspiration behind Midgar Studios, the developer of the role-playing game &quot;Edge of Eternity&quot;.

Midgar has been a popular subject of fan labor, with some fans attempting to recreate the city&#x27;s likeness in a real world or fictional context. Midgar city has been digitally recreated by fans within other game worlds like &quot;Minecraft&quot;, and &quot;Second Life&quot;.

===Critical reception===
Harry Mackin from &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; said the opening act of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in Midgar is the game&#x27;s mostly fondly remembered aspect, and that the city recalls the cyberpunk themes of &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Konstantinos Dimopoulos from &quot;WireFrame&quot; concurred, noting that Midgar is a &quot;place that managed to define, encapsulate, and summarise a whole setting – a pithy urban symbol of &quot;FFVII&quot;″s world&quot;. Jason Faulkner from &quot;GameRevolution&quot; opined that Midgar is an exemplary JRPG setting which &quot;stands as one of the best examples of world-building in the genre&quot;, and the &quot;crowning achievement&quot; of the entire &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Tom Senior from &quot;PC Gamer&quot; perceived Midgar&#x27;s &quot;contradictory identity&quot; to be fascinating in its level of detail, &quot;a breathtaking vision of industrial living gone wrong&quot;.

Joe Juba of &quot;Game Informer&quot; lauded the handling of the city in &quot;Remake&quot;, specifically the expanded detail of its &quot;political conspiracies, everyday desperation, and quiet hope&quot;. Marty Sliva of &quot;The Escapist&quot; approved of the developers&#x27; decision to expand the early hours of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; into a &quot;30-40 hours&quot; experience, noting that he could experience a &quot;new side of Shinra and Midgar&quot;, the latter now with its distinct district and fully realized populations instead of the &quot;single amorphous blob of a city&quot; in the original. &quot;EGMNOW&quot; praised the themes of ecoterrorism and war and the prominent role Midgar had in the narrative. Nadia Oxford of &quot;US Gamer&quot; found that the visual upgrade of Midgar in &quot;Remake&quot; provides an unsettling observation on how Midgar&#x27;s expansion damages the planet it is located in environmentally, as well as the parallels of &quot;human excess and hubris&quot; between the real world and the game&#x27;s world.

In regards to the remains of Midgar from &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Destructoid noted the message within its writing regarding the characters&#x27; lives in Midgar, as its people are able to move on with their lives, but Cloud is unable to due to past trauma. They compared this to how the team behind &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and its fans are still attached to it and unable to move on. Kotaku saw the focus on Midgar&#x27;s ruins as a parallel with psychological trauma due to how some of its survivors suffer from Geostigma, a disease that cannot be fought physically.

<text>Christopher Nicholas Parsons (10 October 1923 – 28 January 2020) was an English actor, straight man and radio and television presenter. He was the long-running presenter of the comedy radio show &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and hosted the game show &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; during the 1970s and early 1980s.

Parsons was born and grew up in Grantham, Lincolnshire, and was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London. He became a full-time actor following the Second World War and began appearing in various theatre, film and television roles, including support to Arthur Haynes as his straight man. He began presenting &quot;Just a Minute&quot; in 1967 and never missed a show until 2018. In addition to his well-known roles on this and &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;, he appeared as a guest on other television shows, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

==Early life==
Christopher Nicholas Parsons was born on 10 October 1923 at 1 Castlegate, Grantham, Lincolnshire; he was the middle child of the family, having an older brother and a younger sister. His father, Paul, was a general practitioner whose patients included the family of Margaret Thatcher; claims that he delivered her are apocryphal. His mother, Nell, née Maggs, was a nurse before her marriage.

Parsons was born left-handed but was made to write with his right hand. As a child, he had a stutter, which he managed to control as he grew older, and was slow to learn owing to dyslexia. He also suffered from migraines but nevertheless excelled at school.

After education at Colet Court and St Paul&#x27;s School in Barnes, London, Parsons&#x27; initial career plan was to become an actor. However, his parents believed that a career in engineering would be better, as he had repaired grandfather clocks as a young man and was creative with his hands. While at school, he was best friends with John Treacher who later joined the Royal Navy and rose to become Commander-in-Chief Fleet. Parsons&#x27; nickname at school was &quot;Shirley&quot; after Shirley Temple.

After he had left school, his family contacted relatives in Scotland, who arranged a job for him in Clydebank near Glasgow, where he spent five years employed as an engineering apprentice at Drysdales, a maker of marine pumps. Parsons was 16 when his parents sent him from his relatively privileged home in London to the industrially-hardened city of Glasgow. Sixty years later, in 2010, he recorded a nostalgic radio programme, titled &quot;Doon the Watta&quot; (on Youtube) about his time as an apprentice, highlighting his posh middle-class accent amidst the Glasgow working-class dialect. While there, he also spent two six-month periods studying engineering at the University of Glasgow. He never graduated, but finished his apprenticeship and gained sufficient qualifications to become a mechanical engineer. He was offered a posting in the Merchant Navy during the Second World War, but he did not join the service after falling seriously ill with pleurisy. He spent five months in hospital and at one point his survival chances were rated only 50-50.

==Career in entertainment==
Parsons started his career while training as an engineering apprentice; he was discovered by Canadian impresario Carroll Levis, and appeared in his radio show.

===Early career in theatre===
At the end of the Second World War, Parsons became a full-time professional actor. He made his stage debut in the West End as Kiwi in &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre in 1945 which ran for over a year, then played the lead in a tour of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;. He made his film debut in &quot;Master of Bankdam&quot; in 1947 and continued his stage career, with two years in repertory at Bromley, and later, Windsor and Maidstone. In 1952, he became a resident comedian at the Windmill Theatre, performing regular nights of stand-up comedy to packed houses.

He starred in the West End show &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot; and other West End productions.

===Film, TV and radio===
In the 1950s and 1960s, he appeared in many supporting roles in British films. In the late 1960s, he portrayed David Courtney in the American sitcom &quot;The Ugliest Girl in Town&quot;.

In the 1950s, Parsons provided the non-singing voice of Tex Tucker in the children&#x27;s TV puppet series &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, having put himself forward for the job at the suggestion of his first wife, actress and voiceover artiste Denise Bryer, who was in the show. During the late 1960s, he created and presented a satirical programme on BBC Radio 4 called &quot;Listen to This Space&quot;, which by the standards of its time was very avant-garde, and he received the Radio Personality of the Year Award for his work on this programme in 1967.

Parsons became known to TV audiences in the 1950s and 1960s as the straight man to comedian Arthur Haynes for ten years; the partnership broke up at Haynes&#x27; request. They had a successful season at the London Palladium in 1963, and shortly before the split appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in the United States, although Parsons was not credited. Subsequently, Parsons returned to the stage, before becoming a regular on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; from 1968 to 1971.

After Haynes died, Parsons appeared as a personality in his own right on television, including in the long-running Anglia Television quiz show &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;, broadcast weekly from 1971 to 1983. In 1983 Hill wrote and performed in the sketch &quot;Sale of the Half Century&quot;, with himself cast as Parsons.

Parsons was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1978 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

===&quot;Just a Minute&quot;===

Parsons was the host of the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel game &quot;Just a Minute&quot; from its first broadcast on 22 December 1967.

Although there were a number of early episodes when he relinquished the chair and was a panellist, Parsons never missed an episode until 2018, when regular panellist Gyles Brandreth stood in for him for two episodes that were recorded in April and broadcast in June, due to a bout of illness: Parsons was then 94 years old. Brandreth again stood in the following year for two shows recorded at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. &quot;Just a Minute&quot; continued to be transmitted with Parsons as host until his last show on 23 September 2019. After Parsons&#x27; death there were several guest hosts until a new permanent host Sue Perkins took over from 2021.

===1980s===
In 1988, Parsons appeared as himself in &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door&quot;, alongside Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson. The following year, he guest-starred in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, playing Reverend Wainwright in the Seventh Doctor serial &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot;.

===1990s===
Parsons featured in the original London cast of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre in 1990 as the Narrator. In 1991, he appeared as the Mayor in the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s series &quot;Bodger &amp; Badger&quot;. This was followed by an appearance in the fourth and final series of the UK TV show &quot;Cluedo&quot; as Reverend Green in 1993.

Parsons took the role of the Narrator in the 21st anniversary revival of the stage musical &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in the West End in 1994.

===Later career===
In 2005 Parsons was guest presenter on the BBC topical quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He appeared on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; in 2007. &quot;Just a Minute&quot; transferred to television in 2012 for a ten-part early-evening series to celebrate its 45th anniversary, with Parsons and regular panellist Paul Merton. He appeared opposite ex-wife Denise Bryer in the Big Finish adaptation of the Gerry Anderson series &quot;Terrahawks&quot;, playing the ex-husband of Bryer&#x27;s character, Zelda.

Parsons wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;The Straight Man: My Life in Comedy&quot;, which was published in 1994, and he produced a book of memoirs in 2010 called &quot;Nicholas Parsons: With Just a Touch of Hesitation, Repetition and Deviation&quot;.

In October 2016, at the age of 92, Parsons presented the BBC documentary &quot;The Incredible Story of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s Watch&quot;, following the story of the Marie Antoinette watch created by Abraham-Louis Breguet. Parsons was a life-long collector of clocks and watches.

He played himself and provided the voice of Dagon, Lord of the Files in &quot;Good Omens&quot;, filmed between 2017 and 2018.

From 2001, he appeared annually at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe presenting his comedy cabaret show &quot;The Happy Hour&quot;.

==Other roles==
From 1988 to 1991, he served as Rector of the University of St Andrews. In 2005, he became for a short period honorary Chairman of the International Quizzing Association (IQA), a body that organises the World and European Quizzing Championships. He was a leading member of the Grand Order of Water Rats charity and was King Rat in 2019. He was also a patron of the British Stammering Association and was the president of the charity the Lord&#x27;s Taverners from 1998 to 1999, a charity that he joined in 1964 and remained a member of until his death. He was an Ambassador for Childline and The Silver Line.

Parsons was a supporter of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Democrats. He was invited to stand as a Liberal Party candidate for Yeovil in the 1970s, but he turned down the opportunity in order to remain in the entertainment industry. On 17 October 2013, a week after his 90th birthday, he appeared as a guest on the BBC One political discussion show &quot;This Week&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Parsons was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours for services to drama and broadcasting. He was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for charitable services, especially to children&#x27;s charities.

Having served as rector of the University of St Andrews from 1988 to 1991, he was awarded an honorary LLD by the university in 1991. He was also awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Leicester in 2016, and an honorary D.Litt by the University of Lincoln in 2014.

He held the Guinness World Record for the longest after-dinner speech (11 hours) until it was reclaimed by former holder Gyles Brandreth.

==Personal life==
Parsons was married twice. He was first married to actress Denise Bryer in 1954; together they had two children. The couple divorced in 1989. He subsequently married Ann Reynolds in 1995. He was a keen cricket fan, both as a player and supporter, and had a lifelong enthusiasm for clocks.

==Health and death==
In August 2019, Parsons suffered a fall on a train to Edinburgh, while travelling to perform his show &quot;The Happy Hour&quot; at the Edinburgh Fringe. On admission to hospital a few days later, he was found to have prostate cancer, a stomach ulcer and anaemia, and remained hospitalised in Edinburgh for 10 days, before being moved to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, near his home in Aylesbury. After two more weeks in hospital, he returned home and began a slow recuperation from the fall. Despite his illness, he continued to work through his final months of life, until his death at Stoke Mandeville Hospital on 28 January 2020, aged 96.

<text>James Ivory, FRS FRSE KH LLD (17 February 1765 – 21 September 1842) was a British mathematician. He stated and proved Ivory&#x27;s lemma.

==Life==
Ivory was born in Dundee, son of watchmaker James Ivory. The family lived and worked on the High Street in Dundee.

He was educated at Dundee Grammar School. In 1779 he entered the University of St Andrews, distinguishing himself especially in mathematics. He then studied theology; but, after two sessions at St Andrews and one at Edinburgh University, he abandoned all idea of the church, and in 1786 he became an assistant-teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy in the newly established Dundee Academy. Three years later he became partner in, and manager of, a flax spinning company at Douglastown in Forfarshire, while continuing mathematical research as a hobby. He was essentially a self-trained mathematician, and was not only deeply versed in geometry, but also kept up with contemporary developments in mathematical analysis.

He published a memoir with an analytical expression for the rectification of the ellipse in the &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot; (1796), and two others on cubic equations (1799) and the Kepler problem (1802). In 1804 the flax-spinning company he managed was dissolved, and he obtained one of the mathematical chairs in the Royal Military College, Great Marlow (later moved to Sandhurst), at which he remained until 1816, when failing health obliged him to resign.

During this period he published several important memoirs in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, which earned for him the Copley Medal in 1814 and ensured his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1815. Of special importance in the history of attractions is the first of these (1809), in which the attraction of a homogeneous ellipsoid upon an external point is reduced to the simpler case of the attraction of a related ellipsoid upon a corresponding point interior to it. This theorem is known as Ivory&#x27;s theorem, though one of its lemmas, Ivory&#x27;s lemma, is better known today and is itself sometimes called Ivory&#x27;s theorem. He also anonymously published an edition of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, which was described as having brought the difficult problems &quot;more within the reach of ordinary understandings&quot;. His later papers in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; discuss astronomical refractions, planetary perturbations, equilibrium of fluid masses, etc. For his astronomical investigations he received a royal medal in 1826 and again in 1839.

In 1831, on the recommendation of Lord Brougham, King William IV granted him a yearly pension of £300 and appointed him Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order. He was directly connected with the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Irish Academy, and was corresponding member of the Royal Academies of Sciences of Paris and Berlin, and of the Royal Society of Göttingen.

In 1839, the University of St. Andrews conferred on him an honorary degree as a Doctor of Laws (LLD).

He died in Hampstead in north London on 21 September 1842.

<text>Mikhail Yefimovich Fradkov (; born 1 September 1950) is a Russian politician who served as Prime Minister of Russia from 2004 to 2007. An Independent, he was the longest serving director of Russia&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Service from 2007 to 2016. Since 4 January 2017, Fradkov has been Director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies.

The cabinet of Fradkov was the first government in the history of Russia that voluntarily resigned in accordance with part 1 of Article 117 of the constitution.

He has the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation.

==Early life==
Fradkov was born near Samara to a family of Jewish origin on his father&#x27;s side. He studied at both the Moscow Machine Tool Design (станкоинструментальный) Institute (graduated 1972) and the Foreign Trade Academy (graduated 1981). In 1973, he was posted to the economic section of the Soviet Union&#x27;s embassy in India, where he remained for two years. He later held several positions back in Russia. In 1991, he was Russia&#x27;s representative to General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva.

==Political career==
In late 1992, Fradkov was appointed Deputy Minister for Foreign Economic Relations. Less than a year later, in October 1993, he became First Deputy Minister for Foreign Economic Relations. On 15 April 1997, a presidential decree by Boris Yeltsin appointed Fradkov Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, a post which he kept for nearly a year. In the middle of 1999, another presidential decree made him Minister of Trade. He was made director of the Federal Tax Police by Vladimir Putin in 2001, having previously been Deputy Secretary of the Security Council. In 2003 he was made Russia&#x27;s representative to the European Union. On 1 March 2004, he was nominated by Putin as the next prime minister, and this appointment was approved by the Duma on 5 March.

Fradkov&#x27;s nomination as prime minister was a surprise to many observers, as he was not seen as part of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s inner circle. Some commentators, such as the Carnegie Moscow Center&#x27;s Lilia Shevtsova, have speculated that his &quot;outsider&quot; status might have been an important factor in his nomination, saying that Putin selected him as someone who was &quot;not a representative of any of the warring clans&quot; in the Kremlin. Former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, whom Fradkov has served under, called Fradkov &quot;absolutely independent from any sort of political clan or group.&quot; Putin and his allies praised Fradkov as experienced, professional, and honest.

On 12 May 2004, Fradkov was appointed prime minister for the second time, as Vladimir Putin had won the presidential election and been inaugurated on 7 May (see also Mikhail Fradkov&#x27;s Second Cabinet). On 12 September 2007 Fradkov announced his resignation to President Putin, which Putin accepted, nominating Viktor Zubkov as Fradkov&#x27;s successor. Putin bestowed an award on Fradkov and said that he would remain in office until the confirmation of a successor by the Duma. Zubkov was confirmed on 14 September 2007.

On 6 October 2007, President Putin announced that he would appoint Fradkov as head of the Foreign Intelligence Service.

Fradkov&#x27;s appointment as head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, combined with his service in India, are suggestive of a KGB background. This calls into question earlier assumptions that he was an &quot;outsider&quot; in Kremlin circles and provides an explanation for Putin&#x27;s trust in him.

In November 2010, reports emerged that one of Fradkov&#x27;s intelligence officers, a Colonel Shcherbakov, had defected to the United States on 21 June 2010, having betrayed a Russian spy ring in the United States. Critics alleged that the suspicions that Shcherbakov was a double agent which emerged when Shcherbakov turned down a promotion requiring a lie detector test should have been followed up more aggressively. Shcherbakov also had a daughter in the United States. &quot;Kommersant&quot;, which broke the story, speculated that Fradkov might be replaced by Sergei Naryshkin and/or Russian intelligence services reorganized.

Pavel Fradkov, the son of Mikhail Fradkov, is a deputy head of the state property watchdog Rosimushchestvo.

=== Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation (2004-2007) ===
Replacing his predecessor Mikhail Kasyanov in March 2004, Fradkov took over as Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation.
In early March 2004, the State Duma overwhelmingly agreed to the appointment of Mikhail Fradkov as Chairman of the Government: he was supported by the United Russia and LDPR factions, as well as some of the deputies from the Motherland, and opposed by the Communist Party faction. Of the non-parliamentary parties, Fradkov&#x27;s candidacy was supported by the Union of Right Forces, noting his experience in the government in various areas and international authority, thanks to his work as Russian Plenipotentiary Envoy to the European Union.

According to many analysts, he was the so-called &quot;technical prime minister&quot; who did not pursue an independent policy. All key decisions were made by the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation, said Alexei Makarkin, deputy general director of the Center for Political Technologies.

The following steps marked the activities of the Fradkov government:
* administrative reform (reorganization of government departments) (2004);
* &quot;Monetization of social benefits&quot; - the replacement of in-kind social benefits with monetary compensation, caused protests in early 2005 (2004);
* Start of implementation of the project &quot;affordable and comfortable housing for the citizens of Russia&quot;;
* Start of implementation of the National Project &quot;Health&quot;;
* Start of implementation of the National Project &quot;Education&quot;;
* Commencement of the housing and communal services reform aimed at attracting businesses to the housing and communal services sector, housing construction development, and mortgages. As a result, at the time of the resignation of the government, about 15% of Russians could afford a mortgage, commercial structures did not actively work in the housing and communal services sector;
* EGAIS (Unified State Automated Information System, N 102-FZ dated 21 July 2005) was implemented to automate state control over the production volume and turnover of ethyl alcohol and alcoholic and alcohol-containing products. The introduction was accompanied by technical problems that caused an alcohol crisis in the first half of 2006.

On 14 November 2005, Vladimir Putin introduced two new positions in the government, further curtailing the prime minister&#x27;s powers. Head of the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev became the first deputy chairman in charge of the implementation of the so-called National Priority Projects, and the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Sergei Ivanov became the deputy chairman in charge of defense and the military-industrial complex.

In 2006, Fradkov received an income of 2.59 million rubles, which increased from 2005 (1.8 million) by 44%.
On 12 September 2007, at a meeting with the President of the Russian Federation, Fradkov was asked to resign the government, motivating it as follows:
The President accepted the government&#x27;s resignation and thanked Fradkov for the results achieved in his work. Putin noted such achievements of the government as reasonable economic growth rates, lower inflation, growth in real incomes of the population, and the launch of major social projects. At the same time, the President offered Fradkov to act as chairman of the government until the State Duma approved the candidacy of a new prime minister.

According to a poll by the Public Opinion Foundation conducted after Fradkov&#x27;s resignation from the post of Prime Minister, the majority of Russians could not name any achievements (80%) or failures (75%) in the activities of the former prime minister in his post. In November 2005, British experts predicted the departure of Mikhail Fradkov from the post of prime minister.

=== Sanctions ===
In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on him and 23 other Russian nationals.

He was sanctioned by the UK government in 2022 in relation to the Russo-Ukrainian War.

==Honours and awards==
* Order of Merit for the Fatherland;
**1st class (12 September 2007) – for outstanding contribution to the socio-economic policy
**2nd class (1 September 2005) – for his great personal contribution to the state&#x27;s economic policy, and many years of honest work

<text>In information theory, turbo codes are a class of high-performance forward error correction (FEC) codes developed around 1990–91, but first published in 1993. They were the first practical codes to closely approach the maximum channel capacity or Shannon limit, a theoretical maximum for the code rate at which reliable communication is still possible given a specific noise level. Turbo codes are used in 3G/4G mobile communications (e.g., in UMTS and LTE) and in (deep space) satellite communications as well as other applications where designers seek to achieve reliable information transfer over bandwidth- or latency-constrained communication links in the presence of data-corrupting noise. Turbo codes compete with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which provide similar performance. Until the patent for turbo codes expired, the patent-free status of LDPC codes was an important factor in LDPC&#x27;s continued relevance.

The name &quot;turbo code&quot; arose from the feedback loop used during normal turbo code decoding, which was analogized to the exhaust feedback used for engine turbocharging. Hagenauer has argued the term turbo code is a misnomer since there is no feedback involved in the encoding process.

==History==
The fundamental patent application for turbo codes was filed on 23 April 1991. The patent application lists Claude Berrou as the sole inventor of turbo codes. The patent filing resulted in several patents including US Patent 5,446,747, which expired 29 August 2013.

The first public paper on turbo codes was &quot;Near Shannon Limit Error-correcting Coding and Decoding: Turbo-codes&quot;. This paper was published 1993 in the Proceedings of IEEE International Communications Conference. The 1993 paper was formed from three separate submissions that were combined due to space constraints. The merger caused the paper to list three authors: Berrou, Glavieux, and Thitimajshima (from Télécom Bretagne, former ENST Bretagne, France). However, it is clear from the original patent filing that Berrou is the sole inventor of turbo codes and that the other authors of the paper contributed material other than the core concepts.

Turbo codes were so revolutionary at the time of their introduction that many experts in the field of coding did not believe the reported results. When the performance was confirmed a small revolution in the world of coding took place that led to the investigation of many other types of iterative signal processing.

The first class of turbo code was the parallel concatenated convolutional code (PCCC). Since the introduction of the original parallel turbo codes in 1993, many other classes of turbo code have been discovered, including serial concatenated convolutional codes and repeat-accumulate codes. Iterative turbo decoding methods have also been applied to more conventional FEC systems, including Reed–Solomon corrected convolutional codes, although these systems are too complex for practical implementations of iterative decoders. Turbo equalization also flowed from the concept of turbo coding.

In addition to turbo codes, Berrou also invented recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes, which are used in the example implementation of turbo codes described in the patent. Turbo codes that use RSC codes seem to perform better than turbo codes that do not use RSC codes.

Prior to turbo codes, the best constructions were serial concatenated codes based on an outer Reed–Solomon error correction code combined with an inner Viterbi-decoded short constraint length convolutional code, also known as RSV codes.

In a later paper, Berrou gave credit to the intuition of &quot;G. Battail, J. Hagenauer and P. Hoeher, who, in the late 80s, highlighted the interest of probabilistic processing.&quot; He adds &quot;R. Gallager and M. Tanner had already imagined coding and decoding techniques whose general principles are closely related,&quot; although the necessary calculations were impractical at that time.

==An example encoder==
There are many different instances of turbo codes, using different component encoders, input/output ratios, interleavers, and puncturing patterns. This example encoder implementation describes a classic turbo encoder, and demonstrates the general design of parallel turbo codes.

This encoder implementation sends three sub-blocks of bits. The first sub-block is the &quot;m&quot;-bit block of payload data. The second sub-block is &quot;n/2&quot; parity bits for the payload data, computed using a recursive systematic convolutional code (RSC code). The third sub-block is &quot;n/2&quot; parity bits for a known permutation of the payload data, again computed using an RSC code. Thus, two redundant but different sub-blocks of parity bits are sent with the payload. The complete block has bits of data with a code rate of . The permutation of the payload data is carried out by a device called an interleaver.

Hardware-wise, this turbo code encoder consists of two identical RSC coders, &quot;C&quot;1 and &quot;C&quot;2, as depicted in the figure, which are connected to each other using a concatenation scheme, called &quot;parallel concatenation&quot;:

In the figure, &quot;M&quot; is a memory register. The delay line and interleaver force input bits dk to appear in different sequences.
At first iteration, the input sequence &quot;d&quot;k appears at both outputs of the encoder, &quot;x&quot;k and&quot; y&quot;1k or &quot;y&quot;2k due to the encoder&#x27;s systematic nature. If the encoders &quot;C&quot;1 and &quot;C&quot;2 are used in &quot;n&quot;1 and &quot;n&quot;2 iterations, their rates are respectively equal to

:formula_1

==The decoder==
The decoder is built in a similar way to the above encoder. Two elementary decoders are interconnected to each other, but in series, not in parallel. The formula_2 decoder operates on lower speed (i.e., formula_3), thus, it is intended for the formula_4 encoder, and formula_5 is for formula_6 correspondingly. formula_2 yields a soft decision which causes formula_8 delay. The same delay is caused by the delay line in the encoder. The formula_5&#x27;s operation causes formula_10 delay.

An interleaver installed between the two decoders is used here to scatter error bursts coming from formula_2 output. &quot;DI&quot; block is a demultiplexing and insertion module. It works as a switch, redirecting input bits to formula_2 at one moment and to formula_5 at another. In OFF state, it feeds both formula_14 and formula_15 inputs with padding bits (zeros).

Consider a memoryless AWGN channel, and assume that at &quot;k&quot;-th iteration, the decoder receives a pair of random variables:

:formula_16

where formula_17 and formula_18 are independent noise components having the same variance formula_19. formula_20 is a &quot;k&quot;-th bit from formula_21 encoder output.

Redundant information is demultiplexed and sent through &quot;DI&quot; to formula_2 (when formula_23) and to formula_5 (when formula_25).

formula_2 yields a soft decision; i.e.:

:formula_27

and delivers it to formula_5. formula_29 is called the &quot;logarithm of the likelihood ratio&quot; (LLR). formula_30 is the &quot;a posteriori probability&quot; (APP) of the formula_31 data bit which shows the probability of interpreting a received formula_31 bit as formula_33. Taking the &quot;LLR&quot; into account, formula_5 yields a hard decision; i.e., a decoded bit.

It is known that the Viterbi algorithm is unable to calculate APP, thus it cannot be used in formula_2. Instead of that, a modified BCJR algorithm is used. For formula_5, the Viterbi algorithm is an appropriate one.

However, the depicted structure is not an optimal one, because formula_2 uses only a proper fraction of the available redundant information. In order to improve the structure, a feedback loop is used (see the dotted line on the figure).

==Soft decision approach==
The decoder front-end produces an integer for each bit in the data stream. This integer is a measure of how likely it is that the bit is a 0 or 1 and is also called &quot;soft bit&quot;. The integer could be drawn from the range [−127, 127], where:
* −127 means &quot;certainly 0&quot;
* −100 means &quot;very likely 0&quot;
* 0 means &quot;it could be either 0 or 1&quot;
* 100 means &quot;very likely 1&quot;
* 127 means &quot;certainly 1&quot;

This introduces a probabilistic aspect to the data-stream from the front end, but it conveys more information about each bit than just 0 or 1.

For example, for each bit, the front end of a traditional wireless-receiver has to decide if an internal analog voltage is above or below a given threshold voltage level. For a turbo code decoder, the front end would provide an integer measure of how far the internal voltage is from the given threshold.

To decode the -bit block of data, the decoder front-end creates a block of likelihood measures, with one likelihood measure for each bit in the data stream. There are two parallel decoders, one for each of the -bit parity sub-blocks. Both decoders use the sub-block of &quot;m&quot; likelihoods for the payload data. The decoder working on the second parity sub-block knows the permutation that the coder used for this sub-block.

==Solving hypotheses to find bits==
The key innovation of turbo codes is how they use the likelihood data to reconcile differences between the two decoders. Each of the two convolutional decoders generates a hypothesis (with derived likelihoods) for the pattern of &quot;m&quot; bits in the payload sub-block. The hypothesis bit-patterns are compared, and if they differ, the decoders exchange the derived likelihoods they have for each bit in the hypotheses. Each decoder incorporates the derived likelihood estimates from the other decoder to generate a new hypothesis for the bits in the payload. Then they compare these new hypotheses. This iterative process continues until the two decoders come up with the same hypothesis for the &quot;m&quot;-bit pattern of the payload, typically in 15 to 18 cycles.

An analogy can be drawn between this process and that of solving cross-reference puzzles like crossword or sudoku. Consider a partially completed, possibly garbled crossword puzzle. Two puzzle solvers (decoders) are trying to solve it: one possessing only the &quot;down&quot; clues (parity bits), and the other possessing only the &quot;across&quot; clues. To start, both solvers guess the answers (hypotheses) to their own clues, noting down how confident they are in each letter (payload bit). Then, they compare notes, by exchanging answers and confidence ratings with each other, noticing where and how they differ. Based on this new knowledge, they both come up with updated answers and confidence ratings, repeating the whole process until they converge to the same solution.

==Performance==
Turbo codes perform well due to the attractive combination of the code&#x27;s random appearance on the channel together with the physically realisable decoding structure. Turbo codes are affected by an error floor.

==Practical applications using turbo codes==
Telecommunications:
* Turbo codes are used extensively in 3G and 4G mobile telephony standards; e.g., in HSPA, EV-DO and LTE.
* MediaFLO, terrestrial mobile television system from Qualcomm.
* The interaction channel of satellite communication systems, such as DVB-RCS and DVB-RCS2.
* Recent NASA missions such as Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter use turbo codes as an alternative to Reed–Solomon error correction-Viterbi decoder codes.
* IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), a wireless metropolitan network standard, uses block turbo coding and convolutional turbo coding.

==Bayesian formulation==
From an artificial intelligence viewpoint, turbo codes can be considered as an instance of loopy belief propagation in Bayesian networks.

<doc id="497536" wikidata="Q1329249" url="?curid=497536" title="Curse of the ninth">
<text>The curse of the ninth is a superstition connected with the history of classical music. It is the belief that a ninth symphony is destined to be a composer&#x27;s last and that the composer will be fated to die while or after writing it, or before completing a tenth.

== History ==
The curse of the ninth superstition originated in the late-Romantic period of classical music. According to Arnold Schoenberg, the superstition began with Gustav Mahler, who, after writing his Eighth Symphony, wrote &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, which, while structurally a symphony, was able to be disguised as a song cycle, each movement being a setting of a poem for soloist and orchestra. Then he wrote his Ninth Symphony and thought he had beaten the curse, but died with his Tenth Symphony incomplete.

This superstition, however, was only hatched by Mahler. Before him, Beethoven and Schubert had died before or while writing their tenth symphonies. Upon realizing this, Mahler created the curse of the ninth and led this superstition into popularity by seemingly proving it true. This superstition has, however, lost popularity, and while it is spoken about, any possible &quot;proof&quot; of it has not happened recently as it did in the era of Beethoven and Mahler. As Maddy Shaw Roberts writes, &quot;The Curse of the Nine is a great story, and it probably fueled a lot of the angst behind Mahler&#x27;s heart-wrenching symphonies. But perhaps it&#x27;s best to treat it as a superstition.&quot;

After Beethoven, Schubert, and Mahler, some composers cited as examples of the curse include:
* Malcolm Arnold
* Kurt Atterberg
* Anton Bruckner (he completed 10 symphonies, but &quot;Study Symphony&quot; and &quot;Symphony No.0&quot; are not counted)
* Antonín Dvořák (only 5 of his symphonies were known during his lifetime)
* Niels Gade 
* Alexander Glazunov
* David Maslanka
* Vincent Persichetti
* Einojuhani Rautavaara
* Alfred Schnittke
* Roger Sessions
* Ralph Vaughan Williams
* Boris Tishchenko

In 2012, composer Philip Glass stated, &quot;Everyone is afraid to do a ninth. It is a jinx that people think about&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The curse of the ninth symphony was addressed in the sixth episode of the 19th season of the British crime series &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; in 2018 and in the fifth episode of the ninth series of the British anthology series &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;, &quot;Curse of the Ninth&quot; (2024).

<text>Reva (according to some sources &quot;Reeva&quot;) was a series of cars made by Dan Werbin and Holger Brånby at Reva gård in Sweden in the mid-1960s. They were two seated coupé mid engined sports cars . The first one built in 1964, the Reva GT, was made with a fibreglass body on a VW Beetle chassis. It was followed by the Reva GT Mk1 powered with a VW 1200 engine and fitted with Porsche brakes. Three Mk1s were made. The Mk II model had more rounded shapes, but still used the VW Beetle chassis. The company produced and sold about 20 bodies, but no complete cars. For the 1968 Mk III they wanted to produce a more finished car. The body was made lower and wider and they no longer used the Beetle chassis, but had a custom made chassis made of steel tubes. The prototype was powered by a 3.5 litre Buick V8, the next was fitted with a 5.4 litre Chevrolet Corvette engine and number three had a 5.41 litre Oldsmobile V8. Then the rules for amateur built vehicles in Sweden changed and they had to end production.

Dan Werbin was hired by Volvo in 1970. In 1973 he became head of product planning at Volvo of America. He also worked on Volvo trucks and some of Volvo&#x27;s concept cars like the Volvo VESC.

<text>The REVA&quot;i&quot;, known as G-Wiz in the United Kingdom, is a small micro electric car, made by the Indian manufacturer Reva Electric Car Company between 2001 and 2012. By late 2013 Reva had sold about 4,600 vehicles worldwide, in 26 countries. Sales in the United Kingdom, its main market, ended by the end of 2011. Production ended in 2012 and the REVAi was replaced by the Mahindra e2o.

In many countries the REVA&quot;i&quot; does not meet the criteria to qualify as a highway-capable motor vehicle, and fits into other classes, such as neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) in the United States and heavy quadricycle in Europe.

The vehicle was originally known as simply the REVA, but was then improved and renamed the REVA&quot;i&quot;.

== Design ==
The REVA&quot;i&quot; is a small three-door hatchback measuring long, wide and high. The car can accommodate two adults in the front and two children in the rear. The back seats can be folded down to provide cargo space. The maximum passenger and cargo weight is .

The REVA&quot;i&quot; is intended for city trips and commuting, particularly in congested traffic. It is registered in Europe as a heavy quadricycle (category L7). It may be exported to the United States, with a speed limiter that limits the speed to twenty five miles per hour, for use as a neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV).

== Models ==
=== First model ===

The first model, produced from 2001 to 2007, was simply called REVA (G-Wiz in the United Kingdom). Its power flowed through a 400 amp motor controller to a DC motor rated at , with a maximum of . Power came from eight 6 V, 200 Ah, lead-acid batteries located under the front seats and wired in series to create 48 V. This model did not have the strengthened chassis that allows subsequent models to pass a crash test at .

=== REVAi ===
In January 2008, a new model was introduced, the REVA&quot;i&quot; (G-Wiz&quot; i&quot; in the United Kingdom). It has an AC drive system, which raises the maximum speed to . The power flows through a 350 Amp motor controller to a 3-phase AC motor rated at peak. Like the REVA, power comes from eight 6 V, 200 A h lead–acid batteries located under the front seats.

It has a &quot;boost&quot; switch that gives 40% extra torque for improved acceleration and hill climbing and increases the top speed to . It weighs , including batteries. The nominal range is , but driving fast or using the heater or air conditioner reduces the range. To address the previous safety concerns, and in conjunction with Lotus Engineering, several new safety features have been added, such as front disc brakes, a collapsible steering column, and a much revised and reinforced chassis that has been successfully crash tested at by ARAI in India.

=== REVA L-ion ===
In January 2009, a new model was launched, the REVA L-ion. It is similar to the REVA&quot;i&quot;, but powered by high performance lithium-ion batteries, which reduce the car&#x27;s curb weight to , offer greater acceleration, reduce charging time to six hours, and extend the nominal range to . The performance of these batteries is also less affected by variations in temperature.

An off-board charging station is available, which requires three phase power and gives a 90% charge in one hour. The REVA L-ion will also have a solar panel on the roof for harnessing solar energy.

=== Comparison of models ===
== Sales and price ==
The car was available in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bhutan, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, The Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jamaica, Malta, Monaco, Nigeria, Nepal, The Netherlands, Norfolk Islands, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Sweden, Ukraine, The United Arab Emirates, The United States, and the United Kingdom.

The different versions of the REVA sold about 4,600 vehicles worldwide by late 2013, and India was its main market, accounting for 55% of global sales, of which, 40% were in the Bangalore city, where Mahindra Reva is based. The UK was one of the leading markets, and the REVA G-Wiz (as it was marketed in the country) was the top selling electric car in Britain for several years, particularly in London.

;Pricing
Pricing in the United Kingdom started at approximately for the standard model The G-Wiz qualifies for exemption from the London congestion charge due to being an electrically propelled vehicle. The REVA was also sold in other European countries, including Spain and Norway. In Costa Rica, the REVAi was launched in March 2009 and is sold for . In the Chilean market was sold for .

The REVAi was available in the Republic of Ireland at a retail price of for the REVA Standard and for the better specified REVA Li-Ion.

REVA was sold for 350,000 () in India and has a &quot;running cost of just 40 paise/km&quot; (40 paise [0.08 US cent]/km), considering the Indian petrol price of /liter.

== Safety concerns ==
The REVA is exempt from most European crash test rules, because its low weight and power registers it in the European &quot;heavy quadricycle&quot; category instead of the &quot;car&quot; category.

The UK Department for Transport found &quot;serious safety concerns&quot; after crashing a now-discontinued G-Wiz at into a deformable barrier on 24 April 2007, which is part of the normal test for production cars. Likewise, a test commissioned by &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; that followed the Euro NCAP crash test specifications found that the occupants would suffer &quot;serious or life-threatening&quot; injuries in a 64 km/h (40 mph) crash.

In October 2010, a fatal accident in London occurred between a G-Wiz and a Škoda Octavia, with the driver of the G-Wiz, British scientist Judit Nadal, being killed. The coroner Andrew Walker was quoted as saying about the G-Wiz at the inquest: “What concerns me is that this vehicle was destroyed in this collision in a way that I have not seen a vehicle destroyed before” but he did not recommend further action regarding the vehicle&#x27;s design. Mr Walker said he would be writing to Transport for London about making improvements to the safety of the junction. Subsequently, the government ordered an investigation into the safety of small electric vehicles.

Current REVA&quot;i&quot; and REVA L-ion models include several new safety features such as front disc brakes, a collapsible steering column, and a much revised and reinforced chassis that has been successfully crash tested in India by ARAI. A frontal crash test video of the new model is available online.

== Reception and criticism ==
The REVAi has been panned by many critics, including criticisms that it is underpowered, unsafe, and ugly. The BBC programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; has consistently and incessantly lambasted the G-Wiz, named it the Worst Car of 2007 and even blew it up later that same episode; co-presenter James May referred to it as &quot;the worst car for this year - and indeed for every other year whilst we have breath in our bodies — it is the most stupid, useless and dangerous car ever to stalk the earth. It is totally terrible, and disgusting.&quot;

In July 2004, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported Archie Norman owned a G-Wiz to commute around London, and outside London, he drove a Volkswagen Golf.

In October 2013, &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; placed the G-Wiz on its list of &quot;The 13 worst cars of the last 20 years.&quot;

In December 2016, twenty G-Wiz vehicles were destroyed in an episode of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; and continuing on the theme of lambasting the car, which the presenters started whilst working together on &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

<text>Sir Robert Seppings, FRS (11 December 176725 April 1840) was an English naval architect. His experiments with diagonal trusses in the construction of ships led to his appointment as Surveyor of the Navy in 1813, a position he held until 1835.

==Biography==
Seppings was born to Robert Seppings (1734–1781) and his wife Lydia Milligen (1740–1821), at Fakenham, Norfolk, on 11 December 1767 and was baptised three days later. In 1782 he was apprenticed in Plymouth Dock. In 1800, when he had risen to be master shipwright assistant in the yard, he invented a device which greatly reduced the time required to repair the lower portions of ships in dry dock when compared with the laborious process of lifting then in vogue. His plan was to make the keel of the ship rest upon a series of supports placed on the floor of the dock and each consisting of three parts - two being wedges arranged one on each side of the keel at right angles to it, with their thin ends together, while the third was a vertical wedge fitting in and supported by the lower pair. The result was that it became possible in a comparatively short time to remove these supporting structures by knocking out the side wedges, when the workmen gained free access to the whole of the keel, the vessel remaining suspended by the shores. Soon, his creation became commonly known as &quot;Seppings Blocks.&quot; For this invention Seppings received £1000 from the Admiralty, and in 1804 was promoted to be a master shipwright at Chatham.

At Chatham, in spite of the repugnance to innovation displayed by the naval authorities of that period, he was able to introduce important innovations in the methods of ship-construction. Seppings innovations were probably influenced by the work of William May, shipbuilder for the Dutch Navy in Amsterdam and son of John May (shipwright). Quoted as saying &quot;partial strength produces general weakness&quot;, Seppings significantly improved the strength and seaworthiness of the Navy&#x27;s fleet. He improved the design of the bow and the stern, but his greatest influence on ship design was in the introduction of &#x27;diagonal bracing&#x27; into the construction of the hull. He first experimented with the idea in 1800 when he retrofitted the frigate with the trusses. The method was first introduced to a ship of the line in 1805 with the refitting of the 74-gun .

The use of the diagonal trusses greatly increased the stiffness of the hull, improving a ship&#x27;s sea worthiness and, more importantly, allowing longer hulls to be built without the drawback of excessive hogging (drooping of the hull at the bow and stern, where buoyancy is at its lowest). This meant that the rigging had better anchor points to take the force of high cross-winds, while &#x27;working&#x27; of the hull was lessened. Working was the term used for the result of shear forces along the hull in rough seas opening and closing the joints between hull planking. This caused the oakum caulking between the planks to become ineffective, thus leading to problematic leaking.

Seppings was also instrumental, along with other innovators, in the introduction of iron elements into ship construction, reducing the need for &#x27;grown timbers&#x27;, which were in increasingly short supply (grown timbers were structural elements, such as &#x27;knees&#x27;, that needed timber grown to shape in the living tree, in order to give the required strength).

These stronger designs offered better protection than the old forms to the crews against the enemy&#x27;s fire, permitted a powerful armament to be fitted, and better allowed the ships to be kept on-station during bad weather, since the vessel would be more able to resist the stresses consequently reducing wear on the hull and subsequent leaks and salt water damage (especially insidious and dangerous to a ship where wood and iron were in contact).

Seppings was appointed joint Surveyor of the Navy alongside Joseph Tucker in 1813, and held that office till his retirement in 1832.

Seppings received a knighthood in 1819. He died at Taunton on 25 April 1840.

==Family==

In June 1795 he married Charlotte Milligen (1770–1834). They had six daughters and four sons.

<text>Sterling Rufus Lyon (January 30, 1927 – December 16, 2010) was a Canadian lawyer, cabinet minister, and the 17th premier of Manitoba from 1977 to 1981. His government introduced several fiscally-conservative measures, and was sometimes seen as a local version of the government of Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom. He also successfully fought for the inclusion of the notwithstanding clause in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

==Early life==
Born in Windsor, Ontario, the son of David Rufus Lyon and Ella Mae Cuthbert, he moved with his family to Manitoba at a young age and grew up in Portage la Prairie. Lyon graduated from Portage Collegiate Institute in 1944, where he served as vice-president of the school&#x27;s student council.

==Education and legal career==
Sterling Lyon graduated from United College (now the University of Winnipeg) in 1948, and received an LL.B from the Manitoba Law School in 1953. For four years after completing his legal education, he worked as a Crown attorney. In 1953, he married Barbara Jean Mayers.

==Political career==
Lyon was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1958, in the south-central Winnipeg riding of Fort Garry, running as a Progressive Conservative. Lyon defeated incumbent Liberal-Progressive MLA L. Raymond Fennell, and was subsequently named as Attorney General in Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s minority government.

Roblin&#x27;s Tories won a majority in 1959, and Lyon was easily re-elected in his own riding. He continued to serve as Attorney General, and also served as Minister of Municipal Affairs (September 30, 1960 – October 25, 1961) and Minister of Public Utilities (October 31, 1961 – June 12, 1963).

On December 9, 1963, Lyon was shifted from the Attorney General&#x27;s position to the Ministry of Mines and Natural Resources. He held this position until June 22, 1966, and briefly served as Public Utilities minister again in mid-1964. Lyon became Attorney General again after the 1966 election, and also served as Minister of Tourism and Recreation from 1968 to 1969. He was re-elected easily in 1962 or 1966. He served a total of nine years as Attorney General.

When Roblin moved to federal politics in 1967, Lyon was one of four candidates who sought to replace him. He was defeated by Walter Weir on the third ballot, and did not seek re-election in 1969. Although Weir and Lyon were both politically to the right of Roblin, they represented different constituencies in the party: Weir was a rural populist, Lyon a supporter of urban business development.

In February 1969, Lyon expressed skepticism about the wisdom of codifying common law rights in a written constitution.

Lyon ran for the House of Commons of Canada in 1974 for the federal Progressive Conservatives, narrowly losing the riding of Winnipeg South to Liberal incumbent James A. Richardson.

The following year, Lyon returned to provincial politics to challenge Sidney Spivak for the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s leadership. Spivak, a former cabinet colleague of Lyon&#x27;s who had been elected party leader in 1971, was a Red Tory opposed by many of the more conservative figures within his caucus. The right wing of the party consolidated around Lyon&#x27;s challenge, and he defeated Spivak by fifty-seven votes at a very divisive leadership convention in December 1975. Lyon returned to the legislature for the rural riding of Souris-Killarney in a 1976 by-election.

===Premier of Manitoba===

In 1977, Lyon transferred to the west Winnipeg seat of Charleswood. He led the Progressive Conservative Party to an upset victory over Edward Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats), picking up 12 seats for a total of 33. Lyon&#x27;s government cut spending in several departments and reduced investment in several social programs sponsored by the NDP. In other respects, the Lyon government&#x27;s commitment to &quot;small government&quot; was ambivalent—it was, for instance, highly supportive of large-scale energy-development projects. Roblin has argued that the Lyon government&#x27;s right-wing reputation was undeserved, but few others have as yet agreed with this assessment.

Lyon was also an initial opponent of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s constitutional plans, and subsequently became a leading supporter of the notwithstanding clause provision. He also fought, unsuccessfully, to have property rights entrenched in the Constitution of Canada.

Lyon&#x27;s PCs lost government to the NDP, now led by Howard Pawley, in 1981, after only one term in office. The Tories lost 11 seats, almost as much as they had won four years earlier.

===Post-premiership===

Lyon acted as Leader of the Opposition for two years and fought Pawley&#x27;s proposals to entrench the rights of Franco-Manitobans in the Constitution. In 1983, Lyon stepped down as Tory leader and was replaced by Gary Filmon. Lyon retired from politics when he did not run for re-election in the 1986 provincial election.

==Post-political career==
He was appointed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal in 1986. He served there until retiring in 2002. Sterling Lyon died on December 16, 2010, following a brief illness, at the age of 83.

==Distinctions and awards==
He was sworn into the Privy Council on April 17, 1982, by Governor General Edward Schreyer on the advice of Pierre Trudeau.

In 2004, Lyon was chosen as the University of Winnipeg&#x27;s annual recipient of the &quot;Distinguished Alumnus Award&quot;. In 2009, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions as a judge and long-time politician in Manitoba, where, as premier, he led the expansion of community-based health and social services, and modernized governmental financial procedures&quot;.

The Sterling Lyon Parkway in Winnipeg was completed and opened to traffic in November 2005. The route was added during the construction of the Kenaston Underpass. The Sterling Lyon Parkway, a new east–west road, has replaced a section of Wilkes Avenue near the underpass.

==Legacy==
Though his premiership was short, it&#x27;s been argued that those years left an enduring legacy. An unsigned editorial in the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; argued:The other major pillar of Mr. Lyon&#x27;s legacy – the inclusion of the notwithstanding clause in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms as a defence of the supremacy of elected parliaments over unelected courts – was controversial when he first supported it and remains so today. He feared that provincial and federal parliaments would themselves cede their power to the courts to avoid controversial issues, a fear that has proved well founded.Sterling Lyon Parkway in Winnipeg was named in his honour.

<doc id="497550" wikidata="Q593857" url="?curid=497550" title="Wonderfalls">
<text>Wonderfalls is an American fantasy comedy drama television series created by Todd Holland and Bryan Fuller. The series premiered on Fox on March 12, 2004, and only four episodes were aired before Fox canceled the show in April 2004 due to low ratings. The remaining nine episodes were later aired on Canadian network VisionTV beginning in November 2004 when it acquired all 13 episodes. The entire series was released on DVD in 2005.

The show centers on Jaye Tyler (Caroline Dhavernas), a recent Brown University graduate with a philosophy degree, who holds a dead-end job as a sales clerk at a Niagara Falls gift shop. Jaye is the reluctant participant in conversations with various animal figurines – a wax lion, brass monkey, stuffed bear, and mounted fish, among others – which direct her via oblique instructions to help people in need.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; included the series in their 2013 list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;.

== Cast and characters ==

=== Main characters ===
* Caroline Dhavernas as Jaye Tyler – A 24-year-old graduate of Brown University who, at the start of the series, is discontentedly working as a salesclerk at Wonderfalls Gift Emporium and living in a trailer. She avoids her loving – and overbearing – family, whose successes she seems determined not to emulate, spending most of her time at The Barrel, a local bar at which her best friend, Mahandra, is a cocktail waitress. Despite her being extremely caustic and a deliberate underachiever, Jaye&#x27;s life takes an odd turn when various muses, in the form of animal objects, begin talking to her and delivering cryptic instructions. At first uncooperative, Jaye eventually breaks down after they inflict on her various forms of passive coercion, such as keeping her awake all night by singing and harassing her with their messages when she is around others, forcing her to accede in order to avoid appearing crazy. Jaye&#x27;s attempts to ignore or go against the messages often result in unexpected misfortunes, such as when Jaye&#x27;s father is hit by a car. Jaye&#x27;s guilt over the event leads to her following the muses&#x27; instructions throughout the rest of the episode, only to discover that her father&#x27;s injury was, in fact, a blessing, as it led his doctors to discover a potentially life-threatening blood clot. As the series progresses, Jaye becomes more willing to follow the muses&#x27; instructions, although she fights them when they make her do things she does not like, such as driving Eric back into the arms of his wife. Through the course of the series, Jaye undergoes a subtle yet discernible personality shift as the good deeds she unwillingly performs begin to affect the way she perceives the world around her.
* Katie Finneran as Sharon Tyler – The eldest of the Tyler siblings, Sharon is an immigration lawyer and the most ambitious member of the family. Sharon constantly finds herself having to help Jaye – particularly when she has legal trouble – even though there is a strong degree of animosity between the sisters at the start of the series. To Jaye, Sharon is everything she does not want to be: goal- and career-oriented, constantly seeking their parents&#x27; approval, extremely high-strung, and apparently with little enjoyment of her life. Meanwhile, Jaye&#x27;s constant pranks and somewhat callous disregard for her sister have made Sharon highly resentful. In the first episode, when Jaye discovers Sharon&#x27;s &quot;big secret&quot; (that she is a lesbian), they admit that despite their animosity, they do love each other. Jaye not only keeps Sharon&#x27;s secret from everyone else, but she also helps her out on occasion when someone (particularly their parents) comes close to discovering the truth. In turn, despite great shows of reluctance, Sharon always helps Jaye when she needs it and even comforts Jaye when she is in despair over Eric.
* Tyron Leitso as Eric Gotts – Jaye&#x27;s love interest – is introduced in &quot;Wax Lion&quot; under unusual circumstances: Six days prior to the events of the pilot, Eric arrived in Niagara Falls for his honeymoon with his new wife, Heidi. Upon returning to their hotel suite one day, he discovered Heidi &quot;servicing&quot; a hotel bellman. Anguished, he retreated to The Barrel and sat and drank for three straight days, after which the owner offered him a bartending job. Extremely sweet, thoughtful, and kind, Eric is the antithesis of Jaye&#x27;s often-abrasive personality, although he seems intrigued by her brashness and convinced that she is not as uncaring as she claims to be. Although his interest in Jaye is reciprocated, his light flirtation is often rebuffed because of Jaye&#x27;s fears that she is going crazy, his status as a married man, and Jaye&#x27;s deeply rooted fear that she will hurt him. Toward the end of the series, Eric&#x27;s wife Heidi arrives in Niagara in an attempt to win back her husband. Despite having fallen in love with Jaye, her refusal to admit her feelings (caused by the warnings of the muses rather than her own inclination) leads him to remarry Heidi and decide to leave Niagara. In the final episode, Jaye is held hostage by a bank robber at Wonderfalls; because of deep feelings for Jaye, Eric is able to interpret her coolness toward him as an indication that something is wrong and alerts the police. Eric&#x27;s explanation of why his suspicions were aroused in an interview on the local news finally convinces Heidi that there is no hope for her marriage to Eric. At the end of the final episode, he returns from New Jersey to Niagara, having divorced Heidi. His explanation helps Jaye to understand that the muses&#x27; warnings regarding Eric were in order to allow him to come to terms with his relationship with Heidi and end things with her properly.
* Lee Pace as Aaron Tyler – Jaye&#x27;s brother. Aaron is a PhD student of comparative religions and the only one of the Tyler siblings still living at home. Aaron is the most easygoing of his siblings, exhibiting a laconic attitude toward his family and toward Mahandra&#x27;s tension over their burgeoning relationship (although her refusal to acknowledge it does not seem to deflect his interest in her or in legitimizing their relationship). Although they constantly bicker, it is clear that Aaron and Jaye are close (Jaye even asks Sharon at one point if she is angry that Jaye and Aaron like each other better than they like her). Aaron is the only one during the series who learns of the full extent of Jaye&#x27;s communications with the muses, a result of his worry over her strange behavior. Although he first believes that she is crazy, and despite being a self-proclaimed atheist, when things that the muses tell her start coming true, Aaron begins indulging his sister&#x27;s claims, even to the extent of helping her try to rid herself of all the animals that have talked to her. Eventually, Aaron reluctantly suffers a sort of existential crisis when, during a session with Dr. Ron, a cow creamer that had communicated with Jaye mysteriously seems to prove that they really have been talking to his sister. When Jaye asks him to gather all of the animals, he attempts to talk to them himself, exhibiting a desire to be proven wrong about his belief that there is no higher power.
* William Sadler as Darrin Tyler – a highly respected physician, and Jaye, Sharon, and Aaron&#x27;s father. Darrin is a loving father to his children, meddling particularly in Jaye&#x27;s life, as he worries that she is not doing anything to reach her potential. He bails both Jaye and Yvette out of jail in the episode &quot;Crime Dog&quot;. When Jaye apologizes for making him compromise his political beliefs, he tells her that family comes first and even expresses gratitude toward Jaye for hitting him with her car (because it was discovered that he had a potentially fatal blood clot in his leg). Like his wife, Darrin shows constant support to Jaye, even though he is clearly worried that she is not sharing with them what is going on with her.
* Diana Scarwid as Karen Tyler – the Tyler siblings&#x27; mother. Beautiful and very popular as a successful writer of bestselling travel book guides, Karen is friends with more of Jaye&#x27;s high school classmates than Jaye herself was. Karen&#x27;s deep love and concern for her children often manifests as criticism and a lack of respect for their personal space – in the &quot;Crime Dog&quot; episode, Jaye challenges Aaron with the information that Karen goes through his things when he is not home. It is clear that Karen is devoted to her family and particularly worried about her youngest daughter. Jaye even jokes that Karen had a tracking device installed in her at birth, thus never allowing Jaye to escape her family. Karen often questions whether Jaye&#x27;s &quot;problems&quot; are a result of her and Darrin&#x27;s parenting and clearly wants Jaye to open up to her. Often, Karen and Darrin&#x27;s attempts to show their support result in annoying Jaye; despite that, Jaye recognizes that her mother not only loves her but is capable of great insight and compassion – particularly toward the people she loves.
* Tracie Thoms as Mahandra McGinty – Jaye&#x27;s best friend since childhood. Mahandra is a cocktail waitress at The Barrel and a co-worker of Eric&#x27;s. Like Jaye, she has a sarcastic, dry sense of humor and a vengeful streak – particularly when first encountering a despised former high school classmate in the episode &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; or in &quot;Barrel Bear&quot; perceiving Jaye&#x27;s attempts to help the rival of a woman Mahandra has aligned herself with, as a mockery of Mahandra&#x27;s hometown pride. Mahandra often functions as her friend&#x27;s voice of reason, even to the extent of warning Jaye away from Eric, fearing that her friend will only break his heart. Despite her often blunt manner, she and Jaye have always considered her to be &quot;the nice one&quot; in their friendship. Later in the series, Mahandra begins a secret relationship with Jaye&#x27;s brother, Aaron, which she desperately tries to conceal from Jaye and the rest of the Tyler family. The relationship is &quot;outed&quot; in the episode &quot;Caged Bird&quot; when Jaye is taken hostage at the store. Fearing for her friend&#x27;s safety, Mahandra hurries to Wonderfalls but stops short of approaching Jaye during the aftermath. When Aaron sees her, she breaks down, and Jaye and the other Tylers see them kissing.

=== Recurring characters ===
* Jewel Staite as Heidi Socket-Gotts – Eric&#x27;s estranged wife. Heidi makes her first full appearance in the series in the episode &quot;Safety Canary&quot; when she arrives in Niagara in an attempt to win Eric back. Although she presents to Eric a repentant and loving front, she deliberately manipulates him to suit her purposes – faking amnesia and slipping him male-enhancement drugs in an attempt to get him to sleep with her. She hates Jaye, perceiving her as a threat to her relationship with Eric. Although Eric seems to recognize Heidi&#x27;s manipulations, Jaye&#x27;s inability to confess how she feels for him eventually drives him back to his wife. When Heidi sees Eric on a news report explaining how he knew to alert the police to the hostage situation in &quot;Caged Bird&quot;, she begins to realize that although Eric might forgive her, he is truly in love with Jaye. On her way to tell Eric that she is giving up him and their marriage, Heidi collides with the van in which Jaye is being held hostage. This action causes the bank robber who has taken Jaye to be hit by an ambulance, saving Jaye&#x27;s life. Although in the aftermath of the hostage events, it appears that Eric and Heidi have reconciled and returned to New Jersey to begin their life together, Eric reveals later that he only went to help her get settled and to close the book on their marriage by getting a divorce.
* Neil Grayston as Alec &quot;Mouthbreather&quot; – Jaye&#x27;s co-worker. A large part of Jaye&#x27;s animosity toward Alec is that although he is still in high school, he is now her boss and does not hesitate to order her around. She also resents that he was promoted over her. Despite his attempts to be assertive over Jaye, she generally ignores him.
* Chelan Simmons as Gretchen Speck-Horowitz – one of Jaye&#x27;s former classmates. (She later makes an appearance on the TV series &quot;Hannibal&quot;, in which Dhavernas co-stars as a different character.)

== Production ==
The series was an American production, filmed in Niagara Falls, Ontario and Toronto, Ontario (standing in for Niagara Falls, New York and environs), with several Canadian actors cast in lead roles (including the show&#x27;s star). It was created by Bryan Fuller and Todd Holland and executive produced in partnership with Tim Minear. Originally scheduled to debut in the fall of 2003, its premiere was delayed until early 2004. When it finally debuted in March 2004 on the FOX network, &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; received positive reviews from critics, but had trouble attracting viewers. The pilot episode, &quot;Wax Lion&quot;, received a higher Nielsen rating when it was repeated the Thursday after its premiere, and the show was moved from a Friday-night time slot to Thursday. There was little notice or promotion of the time change, and FOX subsequently canceled the show after airing the fourth episode. A fifth episode was advertised but never aired.

Despite its cancellation, &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; developed a loyal fan base. A campaign spearheaded by fans, with an accompanying website, was launched, and several members of the cast and crew visited the site and encouraged the grassroots support.

Immediately after the show&#x27;s cancellation, its producers attempted to interest other networks, including The WB, in picking up the series and some episodes were shown in theatres in Los Angeles during the summer of 2004 in order to raise support for the series.

=== Planned episodes ===
Although the show&#x27;s creators had intended for the 13 episodes of &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; to tell a standalone story, they discussed plans for second and third seasons in an interview and episode commentaries featured on the 2005 DVD release of the series. Among the projected storylines mentioned on the DVD:
* In the second season, Jaye&#x27;s therapist would document their sessions, eventually publishing a book on her, which would lead to her being institutionalized with &quot;Joan of Arc Syndrome&quot; in the third season. Once institutionalized, she would begin to affect the lives of the other residents there.
* An accidental-pregnancy plotline was also planned for Jaye&#x27;s sister Sharon. Having slept with her girlfriend Beth, who had just slept with her ex-husband, in the first season, Sharon would later find out that she was pregnant from him. This &quot;miracle pregnancy&quot; would solve one problem between Beth and her ex-husband: they could not have children.
* A new wax lion, one who was intact, would be introduced, who would advise Jaye against listening to what the original wax lion said.
* In the second season, Aaron would begin to regard his sister as a spiritual leader.
* The young boy (Spencer Breslin) who received a mail order bride from Russia in the episode &quot;Lovesick Ass&quot; would return in the opening of Season 3 in the same institution as Jaye, suffering from pyromania after Jaye broke his heart.

== Episodes ==
Fox aired the first four episodes out of sequence, although the episodes were produced in a different order than was intended for broadcast. The order below is how they are presented on the DVD release. The air dates for episodes 5–13 are when they first aired on television on VisionTV.

There is an alternate version of the first episode &quot;Wax Lion&quot;. It features Kerry Washington playing Mahandra and Adam Scott playing Aaron. On the DVD commentary, the creators state that both actors had to be replaced because they could not commit to future episodes. The alternate version omits Thomas telling Jaye at the end that he is going to marry the nurse. The scene was added because the network wanted the Thomas subplot resolved, even though the creators disliked the scene. It also omits a scene where Jaye throws a quarter into the fountain before any muses start talking to her. The network supposedly wanted an impetus for why the muses started talking.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 76% with an average score of 8.3 out of 10 based on 17 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Although the premise couldn&#x27;t sustain the show beyond a single season, &quot;Wonderfalls&quot;″ deadpan protagonist and witty dialogue offer a distinctive take on twentysomething angst.&quot;

==Broadcast and syndication==
Select unaired episodes were screened in July 2004 at San Diego Comic-Con and at the Knitting Factory in Los Angeles. All 13 episodes of &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; were aired to completion for the first time on Canada&#x27;s VisionTV beginning in October 2004.

&quot;Wonderfalls&quot; was aired by the digital cable network Logo TV beginning in July 2005. Also in July 2005, the British network Sky1 aired the series to completion, though not in the original intended episode order.

The Museum of Television and Radio held a two-day screening of the entire series on January 29 and 30, 2005.

==Home media release==
20th Century Fox released the complete series DVD set on February 1, 2005. The DVD set includes all 13 episodes; six commentary tracks by creators Todd Holland and Bryan Fuller, and actors Caroline Dhavernas and Katie Finneran on &quot;Wax Lion&quot;, &quot;Crime Dog&quot;, &quot;Lovesick Ass&quot;, &quot;Safety Canary&quot;, &quot;Cocktail Bunny&quot; (with Scotch Ellis Loring) and &quot;Caged Bird&quot;; a behind-the-scenes documentary, an examination of the show&#x27;s visual effects, and one of two music videos produced for the theme song, &quot;I Wonder Why the Wonderfalls&quot; by Andy Partridge.

<text>Major James Rennell (3 December 1742 – 29 March 1830) was an English geographer, historian and a pioneer of oceanography. Rennell produced some of the first accurate maps of Bengal at one inch to five miles as well as accurate outlines of India and served as Surveyor General of Bengal. Rennell has been called the &quot;Father&quot; &quot;of&quot; &quot;Oceanography&quot;. In 1830, he was one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society in London.

==Early life==
Rennell was born at Upcot near Chudleigh in Devon. His father, John Rennell, an officer in the Royal Artillery, was killed in action in the Low Countries in July 1747 during the War of the Austrian Succession. His mother Anne subsequently married Mr Elliott, a widower with children of his own and unable to care for additional ones, leading to Rennell being brought up by a guardian, the Rev. Gilbert Burrington, vicar of Chudleigh. The ancient paternal Devonshire family name was formerly spelt Reynell and was of French origin.

Rennell entered the Royal navy as a midshipman at the age of fourteen under Captain Hyde Parker, who was in the process of commissioning the frigate (launched in October 1757) at the beginning of the Seven Years&#x27; War. He was present at the Raid on Cherbourg (1758), and at the disastrous Battle of Saint-Cast in the same year. In 1760, he went out to East India, and served in under Captain Hyde Parker during the three following years, when he saw some active service, including a cutting-out expedition at Pondicherry. He soon mastered the theory and practice of marine surveying, and, on account of his proficiency in this regard, Parker lent his services to the East India Company. He served for a year on board one of the company&#x27;s ships bound to the Philippines, with the object &quot;of establishing new branches of trade with the natives of the intervening places&quot;. Rennell accompanied the hydrographer Alexander Dalrymple and drew several charts and plans of harbours on journeys in the schooner &quot;Cuddalore&quot; (1759–62), the &quot;London&quot; (1762–63) and the &quot;Neptune&quot; (1763–64).

In 1763, at the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, seeing no chance of promotion, Rennell entered the service of the East India Company&#x27;s sea service. He at once received command of a vessel of two hundred tons; but it was destroyed by a hurricane in Madras Roads in March 1763. Fortunately, his captain was on shore, and he was at once appointed to command a small yacht called the &quot;Neptune&quot;, in which he executed surveys of what is now called the Palk Strait and the Pamban Channel. Rennell became a good friend of the Governor of Madras, Robert Palk, who also came from Devon. His next cruise was to Bengal, and he arrived at Calcutta at a time when Governor Vansittart was anxious to initiate a survey of the British territory. Owing to the friendship of an old messmate Mr Topham, who had become the governor&#x27;s secretary, he was chosen for survey duties and was initially commissioned as an ensign in the Bengal Engineers, dated 9 April 1764.

==Survey work in India==

Rennell initially surveyed the Ganges river starting in the autumn of 1764, encountering in 1766 the mountains that he called the Tartarian mountains (the Himalayas). The main purpose of the survey was to find a navigable waterway from Calcutta to the northern regions. In the same year Captain Rennell was nearly killed when the party of surveyors were attacked by sanyasis on the Bhutan border. Injured badly in the shoulder blade, he was taken by boat to Dacca, a journey that took six days. He was treated by Dr Francis Russell and was fortunate to recover although he never gained full function of his right arm. On return Rennell&#x27;s work was much appreciated and he was recommended for a handsome salary of £1000 a year. Rennell immediately sent money home to his mother and sister while also showing gratitude by sending gifts to Rev. Burrington&#x27;s children. In 1767 Lord Robert Clive, the then Governor of Bengal and Bihar, appointed him as surveyor-general of the East India Company&#x27;s dominions in Bengal. After this Rennell was always accompanied by a company of Sepoys.

The headquarters of the surveyor-general were at Dacca, and in the successive working seasons he gradually completed his difficult, laborious, and dangerous task. Mapping was accomplished on the field by army men with distances measured using a perambulator - a calibrated wheel whose revolutions were counted to calculate distance - and a compass. Economic pressures further forced a reduction in pay and there was dissatisfaction among the native ranks on the question of double &quot;batta&quot; (part payment). The surveys were sometimes dangerous, a party of his men were attacked by a leopard and Rennell had to use his bayonet to save his men. Malaria was common and in 1771 he was briefly diverted to military duties in an expedition against a band of raiders. The mapping project was originally a general survey of newly acquired lands, but the job soon gained a wider scope under Warren Hastings, who was appointed as Governor-General in 1773. One of Hastings&#x27; first projects was to begin a Domesday-style reckoning of property, land, people, and culture for taxation of revenue. As for Rennell&#x27;s part in this, his project was carried out much like a military survey, searching for safe passage through territory, with information gathering a secondary object. Rennell received the rank of major of Bengal engineers on 5 April 1776, and retired from active service in 1777. The government of Warren Hastings granted him a pension of £600 per annum, which the East India Company somewhat tardily confirmed.

James Rennell is the surveyor, architect &amp; founder of Calcutta-Bombay Road in 1776. The Calcutta Bombay Road, now known as Old Bombay Road &amp; Odisha State Highway-19 was laid under his supervision in period of 1776-77. The route connected Cosseye River near Kharogpore(Kharagpur) with Subarnarekha river near Gopibalabpore(Gopiballavpur) &amp; with Budhabalanga river near Bangiripossey(Bangriposi). The road was made through Lower parts of Southern Bengal(Gopiballavpur, Jhargram District) &amp; Northern part of Odisha(Baripada, Baripada District) running for . For 200 years from 1776 until 1976, The Calcutta Bombay Road(Old Bombay Road) was the vital route between Bengal &amp; Bombay. The current Kolkata-Mumbai Road(now known as NH-6/NH-49) was built in the 1990s. 

The remaining fifty-three years of his life were spent in London, and were devoted to geographical research chiefly among the materials in the East India House. He took up his residence in Suffolk Street, near Portland Place, where his house became a place of meeting for travellers from all parts of the world.

==Achievements==

Rennell&#x27;s first and most influential work was the &quot;Bengal Atlas&quot; (1779) which was followed by the first detailed map of India (1783), the &quot;Geographical System of Herodotus&quot; (1800), the &quot;Comparative Geography of Western Asia&quot; (1831), and important studies on the geography of northern Africa—apparent in introductions to the Travels of Mungo Park and Hornemann. He also contributed papers to &quot;Archaeologia&quot; on the site of Babylon, the island of St Paul&#x27;s shipwreck, and the landing-place of Caesar in Britain. Rennell published a book titled &quot;&quot; (1788) and dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks.

Beside his geographical and historical works, James Rennell is known today for his hydrographical works on the currents in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. He started his research on these topics when he was travelling by a sailing ship with his family from India to Britain after his retirement in 1777. During the extraordinary prolonged voyage around the Cape of Good Hope he mapped &quot;the banks and currents at the Lagullas&quot; and published in 1778 the work on what is today called the Agulhas Current. This was one of the first contributions to the science of Oceanography. He was the first to explain the causes of the occasional northern current found to the south of the Isles of Scilly, which has since been called as Rennell&#x27;s Current.

After the death of his wife in 1810, he returned to the oceanographic topics. His numerous naval friends gave him a mass of data from their logs, which he assimilated into a chart of all currents in the Atlantic Ocean. During his last years, he wrote his last work &quot;&quot;, published posthumously by his daughter Jane in 1832.

He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1781; and he received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1791, and the gold medal of the Royal Society of Literature in 1825. James Rennell has been called the &quot;Father of Indian Geography,&quot; and for his pioneering work on oceanography as the &quot;Father of Oceanography&quot;.

In later life Rennell suffered from gout and in 1829 he fell from a chair and broke his thigh. He died on 29 March 1830 at his home on Suffolk Street. He was interred in the nave of Westminster Abbey, and there is a tablet to his memory, with a bronze bust by Ludwig Hagbold, near the western door. The year of his death saw the foundation of the Royal Geographical Society. His collection of books were gifted by his heirs to the Royal Geographical Society.

In 1851, botanist Pieter Willem Korthals published &quot;Rennellia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from Indo-China and western Malesia, belonging to the family Rubiaceae and it was named in James Rennell&#x27;s honour.

== Controversy ==
James Rennell is credited with the original mapping of the Mountains of Kong, supposedly located in the western part of Africa, based on information supplied by explorer Mungo Park. This range was intended to support his own theory on the course of the Niger River, and eventually led to a major impact on the mapping industry to include the mountains. In 1802, Aaron Arrowsmith released a map that included the Mountains of Kong as a main physical geographic feature of western Africa, which encouraged other publishers to update their maps to match.

Debate surrounding the existence of the mountain range occurred frequently, however, it was French officer and explorer Louis-Gustave Binger officially reported that the Mountains of Kong did not exist during an expedition in 1887-1888. It was not long after this that the Mountains of Kong were dropped from most map publications.

While the Mountains of Kong have been disproven, it has remained periodically on maps in until the early 20th century.

== Personal life ==
Rennell was &quot;of middle height, well proportioned, with a grave yet sweet expression of countenance. He was diffident and unassuming, but ever ready to impart information. His conversation was interesting, and he had a remarkable flow of spirits. In all his discussions he was candid and ingenuous&quot;. Rennell was however irrational in proposing that the Niger ended in a lake without reaching the sea. He was also strongly opposed to the methods of William Lambton in his proposed trigonometrical survey. His opposition had to be neutralized by Sir Nevil Maskelyne before Lambton&#x27;s plan was approved.

While at Dacca, Rennell became a close friend of John Cartier. It was in Cartier&#x27;s home that he met Jane Thackeray (d. 1810), daughter of Dr Thomas Thackeray, headmaster of Harrow, and a great-aunt of the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray and he married her in 1772. Their older son Thomas (born 1779) died unmarried in 1846, while the second son William (born 1781) worked in the Bengal civil service and died in 1819 without leaving any children. One daughter named Jane (born 1773) died young and was buried in Dhaka, whilst another daughter, also Jane, born in 1777 on St Helena where he had stopped on his way to England married Admiral Sir John Tremayne Rodd, KCB in 1809. Lady Rodd devoted several years publishing her father&#x27;s current charts and revising new editions of his principal works. She died in December 1863.

<doc id="497554" wikidata="Q555043" url="?curid=497554" title="Alexander McDonnell (chess player)">
<text>Alexander McDonnell (1798–1835), sometimes spelled MacDonnell, was an Irish chess master, who contested a series of six matches with the world&#x27;s leading chess player Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais in 1834.

== Early life ==
The son of a surgeon, Alexander McDonnell was born in Belfast in 1798. He was trained as a merchant and worked for some time in the West Indies. In 1820, he settled in London, where he became the secretary of the Committee of West Indian Merchants in which role he advocated strongly on behalf of slave-owning sugar plantation owners. It was a lucrative post that made him a wealthy man and left him with plenty of time to indulge his passion for chess. In his politics, McDonnell was a committed Whig. No confirmed image of McDonnell is known to exist.

== Chess career ==

In 1825, he became a pupil of William Lewis, who was then the leading player in Britain. But soon, McDonnell had become so good that Lewis, fearing for his reputation, simply refused to play him anymore.

Around 1825–1826, McDonnell played Captain Evans, while the latter was on shore leave in London. McDonnell was beaten with what is now regarded in chess circles as the creation of the Evans Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4).

In 1831, along with George Walker, he became a founding member of the Westminster Chess Club and was acclaimed as England&#x27;s best player.

=== La Bourdonnais matches ===

At that time, the world&#x27;s strongest player was the French aristocrat Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais. Between June and October 1834, La Bourdonnais and McDonnell played a series of six matches, a total of eighty-five games, at the Westminster Chess Club in London. McDonnell won the second match, while La Bourdonnais won the first, third, fourth and fifth. The sixth match was unfinished.

In the first game of the third match, McDonnell successfully introduced a new variation in the King&#x27;s Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.Nc3), known today as the McDonnell Gambit.

== Death ==
McDonnell was suffering from Bright&#x27;s disease, a historical classification of nephritis, which affects the kidneys. In the summer of 1835, his condition worsened and he died in London on 15 September 1835 before his match with La Bourdonnais could be resumed.

When La Bourdonnais died penniless in 1840, George Walker arranged to have him buried in London&#x27;s Kensal Green Cemetery, near where his old rival McDonnell is buried.

== Notable games ==
* Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais vs. Alexander McDonnell, 04, London 1834, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted: Central Variation. McDonnell Defense (D20), 0–1 The first immortal game of the history of chess, according to Reuben Fine. A purely positional sacrifice of a queen for two minor pieces.
* Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais vs. Alexander McDonnell, London 1834, Bishop&#x27;s Opening: Lopez Variation (C23), 0–1 An interesting encounter with chances and errors on both sides, ending with a nice two-knights mate.
* McDonnell versus De La Bourdonnais, Match 4 (16), London 1834 A classic game demonstrating the power of a mobile central block of pawns.

<text>Songs in A Minor is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Alicia Keys, released on June 12, 2001, by J Records.

Keys began writing songs for the album in 1995 at age 14 and recording the album in 1998 for Columbia Records, but after they rejected it, she signed a recording contract with Clive Davis&#x27;s Arista Records and eventually J Records. An accomplished, classically trained pianist, Keys wrote, arranged and produced the majority of the album herself. It is a neo soul album with elements of R&amp;B, soul, jazz, hip hop, blues, classical, and gospel music. Lyrically, the songs explore the complexities and various stages of personal relationships. Despite the album&#x27;s title, only one song, &quot;Jane Doe,&quot; is actually written in the key of A minor.
&quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 236,000 copies in its first week. The album has since sold over 7 million copies in the United States and 12 million copies worldwide. It was also an immediate critical success and has since been regarded as a classic. The album earned Keys several accolades, including five Grammy Awards at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. To promote the album, Keys embarked on her first headlining concert tour, entitled Songs in A Minor Tour.

In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

==Recording and production==
Keys began writing the songs that would constitute &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; at age 14, &quot;Butterflyz&quot; being her first composition for the album. Keys had been accepted to Columbia University, which she attended after graduating from the Professional Performing Arts School at age 16. She dropped out after four weeks to pursue her music career full time. She signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and his So So Def label. Keys co-wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;Men in Black&quot;. She also contributed to the So So Def Christmas recordings. Keys began producing and recording the album in 1998. She completed it that same year, but it was rejected by Columbia Records. Keys explained that the producers she was required to work with by the label would tell her to &quot;just get in the booth and sing&quot;, which frustrated her. Her record contract with Columbia ended after a dispute with the label. Keys then performed for Clive Davis, who sensed a &quot;special, unique&quot; artist; he bought Keys&#x27; contract from Columbia and signed her to Arista Records, which later disbanded.

Following Davis to his newly formed J Records label, Keys rented an apartment and struggled to create an album. She began writing the song &quot;Troubles&quot; and came to a realization: &quot;That&#x27;s when the album started comin&#x27; together. Finally, I knew how to structure my feelings into something that made sense, something that can translate to people. That was a changing point. My confidence was up, way up.&quot; Keys learned how to produce by asking questions of the producers and engineers; she wrote, arranged and produced a majority of the album. She recorded the songs &quot;Rock wit U&quot; and &quot;Rear View Mirror&quot;, which were featured on the soundtracks to the films &quot;Shaft&quot; (2000) and &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; (2001), respectively. One of the final songs Keys recorded was &quot;Fallin&quot;. A total of 32 songs were recorded for the album. Originally titled &quot;Soul Stories in A Minor&quot;, the title of the album was changed over concerns that it would limit exposure only to black radio stations.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; is a neo soul album with classical piano references and arpeggios. Keys incorporates classical piano with R&amp;B, soul and jazz into the album&#x27;s music. With influences of classical piano, classic soul and East Coast hip hop, Keys described the album as a &quot;fusion of my classical training, meshed with what I grew up listening to [...] things I&#x27;ve been exposed to and drawn from and my life experiences&quot;. Jane Stevenson of Jam! described the music as &quot;old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Steve Jones wrote that Keys &quot;taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk&quot;. John Mulvey of Yahoo! Music called the album &quot;a gorgeous and ambitious melding of classic soul structures and values to hyper-modern production technique&quot;.

The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Piano &amp; I&quot;, begins with a rendition of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;, combined with a hip hop beat. The introduction is followed by &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, which was produced by Jermaine Dupri. Commended for its &quot;crisp production&quot;, the song samples Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s &quot;Brooklyn Zoo&quot;. Keys&#x27; cover of Prince&#x27;s 1982 ballad &quot;How Come U Don&#x27;t Call Me Anymore?&quot; (retitled &quot;How Come You Don&#x27;t Call Me&quot;) was inspired by a long-term relationship with a partner. The music critic for &quot;PopMatters&quot; felt that the song was credible, but fell short from the original and Stephanie Mills&#x27;s 1980s cover. &quot;Fallin&quot;, the gospel-driven lead single and often considered Keys&#x27; signature song, contains a sample of James Brown&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot;. The song earned Keys comparisons to Aretha Franklin.

&quot;A Woman&#x27;s Worth&quot;, the second single released from the album, is a &quot;gospel-tinged&quot; song that recommends that men show respect to their female partners. &quot;Jane Doe&quot; is a funk-driven song, with backing vocals provided by Kandi Burruss. &quot;The Life&quot;, which elicits Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Gimmie Your Love&quot;, describes Keys&#x27; &quot;philosophy of life and struggle&quot;. The song was compared to the work of the English band Sade. &quot;Mr. Man&quot; contains elements of Latin American music and was described as a &quot;sexy and soulful duet&quot;, in which Jimmy Cozier &quot;adds his spice&quot;. The album ends with the hidden track &quot;Lovin&#x27; U&quot;, which Christian Ward of &quot;NME&quot; compared to works of the musical group the Supremes.

==Release and promotion==
In advance of &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot;, &quot;Girlfriend&quot; was serviced to urban contemporary radio as a promotional single in early 2001 to &quot;introduce&quot; Keys to the general public. In order to promote her, music executive Clive Davis booked Keys to &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Davis also wrote a letter to Oprah Winfrey, asking her to allow Keys, along with Jill Scott and India Arie, to perform on her show. The singers performed on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, where Keys &quot;wowed&quot; the audience. This led to the album&#x27;s pre-orders to double that night. From August to October 2001, Keys toured alongside recording artist Maxwell in promotion of the album. Soon after, she embarked on her Songs in A Minor Tour. A concert at KeyArena in Seattle was partly recorded and the live performances were included on the bonus disc of a European reissue of the album, titled &quot;Songs in A Minor: Remixed &amp; Unplugged&quot;, which was released on October 28, 2002; the bonus disc also includes remixes to the songs from &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot;. The bonus disc was made available on its own exclusively in Japan, under the title &quot;Remixed &amp; Unplugged in A Minor&quot;, on February 26, 2003.

On June 28, 2011, &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; was re-released in two editions to commemorate its tenth anniversary of release. Both editions feature previously unreleased material and a documentary chronicling the making of &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot;. At the BET Awards 2011 on June 26, Keys performed a medley of songs, including &quot;Typewriter&quot;, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Worth&quot; with Bruno Mars and &quot;Maybach Music&quot; with Rick Ross and &quot;Fallin. On June 28, Keys performed &quot;Fallin, &quot;Butterflyz&quot; and &quot;Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down&quot; on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. BET aired &quot;The Story So Far... Alicia Keys&quot; special, highlighting Keys&#x27; ten-year career through her BET moments, on June 28. On June 30, Keys performed &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; in its entirety and told stories of its recording in a show titled Piano &amp; I: A One Night Only Event With Alicia Keys at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. In an interview for MTV, Keys called its tenth anniversary &quot;incredibly surreal for me&quot; and said of the album in retrospect: &quot;This album is possibly the most precious to me as your first album only happens once, and so &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; will always hold a special place in my life that&#x27;s filled with amazing memories. I&#x27;m so proud the songs are still being enjoyed, and I&#x27;m crazy excited to share songs never heard before.&quot; To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot;, the album was yet again re-released on June 4, 2021, with four bonus tracks, including the previously unreleased &quot;Foolish Heart&quot; and &quot;Crazy (Mi Corazon)&quot;.

==Singles==
Davis sent the music video of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Fallin&quot; to MTV; &quot;half the women had tears down their face&quot; when the video finished playing. The song was serviced to rhythmic contemporary, urban adult contemporary and urban contemporary radio stations in April 2001. &quot;Fallin&quot; peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, remaining atop the charts for six and four weeks, respectively. It became the most played song in the United States at the time and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Internationally, &quot;Fallin&quot; peaked within the top ten in almost all countries it charted in, topping the charts in Flanders, the Netherlands and New Zealand, as well as the UK R&amp;B Singles chart.

&quot;A Woman&#x27;s Worth&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on October 2, 2001. It peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single was certified gold by the RIAA. Internationally, the song reached number one in Croatia and top ten in Hungary and New Zealand. The single&#x27;s accompanying music video was directed by Chris Robinson, who directed the video for &quot;Fallin&quot;. Its plot continues from the video for &quot;Fallin&quot;, which revolves around Keys&#x27; travel to her imprisoned boyfriend, and picks up where it left, depicting his release from prison and tries to acclimate to society.

The third single &quot;How Come You Don&#x27;t Call Me&quot; was released on March 11, 2002. It peaked at number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, failing to duplicate the commercial success of its predecessors. Elsewhere, the song peaked within the top ten in Hungary and within the top 40 in Australia, Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Girlfriend&quot; peaked at number 82 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart upon its 2001 release as a promotional single. It was released as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single outside the United States on November 25, 2002. The song reached top 20 in Australia and the Netherlands, while peaking at number 24 in the UK.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 78, based on 10 reviews.

Reviewing the album in &quot;NME&quot;, Sam Faulkner described the balance between contemporary music and retrospective as &quot;an act of pure genius&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine hailed it as &quot;a prime candidate to head up the nu-soul revolution ... with a voice that challenges Mary J. Blige&#x27;s&quot;. Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; said that &quot;Keys already has a musical, artistic and thematic maturity that many more experienced artists never achieve&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Richard Harrington wrote favorably of Keys&#x27; musical influences on the album and expressed that she has &quot;vocal maturity and writing instincts beyond her years&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Mark Anthony Neal praised Keys&#x27; performance on the album and called it &quot;a distinct and oft-times brilliant debut from an artist who clearly has a fine sense of her creative talents&quot;. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, said that the &quot;grace and grit&quot; of the first half warrant the &quot;auspicious debut&quot; label and that, after some &quot;bores that threaten to sink the project midway through,&quot; Keys sustains the album with the songs at the end.

Keys&#x27; vocal performance was lauded; Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; declared that Keys&#x27; displayed a &quot;powerful range, proving she can belt along with the best of them&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; called the album &quot;frequently stunning&quot; and said that Keys sings like &quot;a young Aretha Franklin&quot;. However, some found her lyrics to be sub-par to her singing and musical ability. &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;″s Russell Baillie stated that Keys &quot;might indicate abundant talent aligned to neatly reverential vintage soul style&quot;, but expressed that the songs &quot;don&#x27;t add up to anything particularly memorable&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Beth Johnson called the second half of the album slacked with &quot;sad sack teen themes&quot;, but called it a promising album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Barry Walters perceived her singing as more mature than her songwriting, but commended Keys for her &quot;commanding presence&quot; on the album. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Robert Hilburn said that it &quot;makes a convincing case that&#x27;s she&#x27;s going far—in both a commercial and creative sense&quot;.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine perceived the album&#x27;s music as &quot;rich enough to compensate for some thinness in the writing&quot; and called it &quot;a startling assured, successful debut that deserved its immediate acclaim and is already aging nicely&quot;. Barry Walters wrote in a later article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;the album has aged well – excepting a drum-machine beat or two, it feels timeless.&quot; In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2011), Colin Larkin said Keys had fused urban R&amp;B, hip hop, and blues on what he called &quot;a minor classic of modern soul&quot;. &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; is regarded as an influential and distinctive album of its era.

==Accolades==
&quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; led Keys to win five awards at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, and Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;Fallin, Best New Artist, and Best R&amp;B Album; &quot;Fallin was also nominated for Record of the Year. Keys became the second female solo artist to win five Grammy Awards in a single night, following Lauryn Hill at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards (1999). The album also won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Album. Keys was also named Best New Artist at the 2002 World Music Awards. &quot;Fallin was ranked at number 37 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years in 2003 and was ranked the 413th greatest song of all time by &quot;Blender&quot; magazine. The album was ranked at number two on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top 10 of 2001, number 18 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 2001 Pazz &amp; Jop list, number 27 on &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s Best 40 Albums of 2001 and was also named one of &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Albums Ever. &quot;Q&quot; also listed the album as one of the best 50 albums of 2001. In 2009, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the 95th best album of the past decade, while &quot;Fallin ranked at number 62 on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Songs of the Decade&quot; list. In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; the 57th best album of all time.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Songs in A Minor&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 236,000 copies in its first week. Through word of mouth and promotion, the album remained at number one on the chart, selling a further 221,000 copies in its fourth week. The album spent a total of three non-consecutive weeks at number one, and became one of the best-selling albums of 2001. As of June 2014, the album had sold 6,348,000 copies in the United States. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the album at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 decade-end chart for the 2000s and at number 12 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums decade-end chart.

<doc id="497559" wikidata="Q657518" url="?curid=497559" title="Soviet submarine K-159">
<text>K-159 (Russian: К–159) was a Project 627A &quot;Kit&quot; (Russian: проект-627A кит, NATO reporting name ) nuclear-powered submarine that served in the Northern Fleet of the Soviet Navy from 1963–89. Her keel was laid down on 15 August 1962 at the Severodvinsk &quot;Sevmash&quot; Shipyard No. 402. She was launched on 6 June 1963, and commissioned on 9 October 1963.

== Radioactive discharge accident ==
On 2 March 1965, &quot;K-159&quot; suffered an accident involving radioactive discharges into her steam generators, almost certainly primary coolant leaks from the tubes into the steam chest and thence into the turbines, contaminating her entire propulsion plant. If so, the leaking tubes were plugged, because she continued to operate for another two years before entering the shipyard from 1967 through 1968 for overhaul and to have her steam generators replaced. She returned to the shipyard from 1970 through 1972 for further repairs and refuelling, and then again from 1979 through 1980 for still more repairs.

== Decommissioning and after-service life ==
&quot;K-159&quot; was decommissioned on 30 May 1989 and laid up in Gremikha; her reactors were probably not defuelled. She remained in layup with little or no maintenance for 14 years. Her outer hull rusted until in many places it had &quot;the strength of foil&quot;.

The poor condition of Russia&#x27;s fleet of decommissioned nuclear submarines concerned the nearby Baltic and Scandinavian nations, and in mid-2003, five countries made a combined donation of more than US$200 million in support of decommission and disposal of the hulls. In anticipation of receiving those funds, Admiral Gennady Suchkov, Commander of the Northern Fleet, decided to tow all the 16 laid up submarines from Gremikha to shipyards where they would be dismantled. &quot;K-159&quot; was the 13th hull to be towed.

Because &quot;K-159&quot;″s hull was rusted through in so many places, it was kept afloat by spot-welding large empty tanks to her sides as pontoons. Those tanks, however, were manufactured in the 1940s, were not air-tight, and were no better maintained than the submarine&#x27;s hull.

== Foundering and sinking ==
On 28 August 2003, &quot;K-159&quot; and her pontoons were manned by ten Russian sailors and taken under tow to Polyarny. That crew kept the pontoons pressurized and the submarine hull pumped out, but during the early morning hours of 30 August they encountered a squall that ripped away one of the pontoons. &quot;K-159&quot; did not sink immediately, but was clearly in distress. Northern Fleet was notified at 01:20, and Admiral Suchkov arrived at headquarters 20 minutes later. By 03:00 the wreck had sunk in the Barents Sea, 200 metres down, with nine of her crew and most likely 800 kilograms of spent nuclear fuel containing some 5.3 gigabecquerels of radionuclides.

The Military Prosecutor General&#x27;s office brought charges against Captain Second Class Sergei Zhemchuzhnov who was overseeing the towing operation. President of Russia Vladimir Putin removed Suchkov from service on the recommendation of Navy Chief of Staff Vladimir Kuroyedov. Putin appointed Vice Admiral Sergey Simonenko acting Commander of the Northern Fleet. Before that, he headed the headquarters of the Northern Fleet.

The Russian government considered plans to raise the wreck of &quot;K-159&quot;. Admiral Kuroyedov believed that &quot;we should not leave nuclear objects lying on the seabed&quot;. Initial plans were to do so in August or September 2004, but they were postponed. In 2007, the British Ministry of Defence began preparations for a salvage operation. As part of that recovery planning, the Scottish company Adus was hired to evaluate the wreck. A high-resolution sonar generated image of &quot;K-159&quot; was published on 1 April 2010.

In March 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a draft decree for an initiative to lift the &quot;K-159&quot; and and four reactor compartments from the Barents Sea. It is likely that a special salvage vessel will need to be built increasing the estimated recovery cost of US$330m.

== Legal actions ==
Shortly after the loss of the submarine, the widows of four of the nine deceased submariners filed a lawsuit against the Russian Defence Ministry demanding compensation of one million rubles (about $US37,500) each in moral damages, a lawyer acting for them said. The Ministry objected to the suit, saying that the widows should press charges against Suchkov, who was convicted by a court martial of criminal negligence leading to the submariners&#x27; deaths.

Two bodies were recovered immediately. Senior Lieutenant Maksim Tsibul&#x27;skij was rescued alive and recovered in the Severomorsk Military Hospital. The other seven were presumably trapped in the wreck.

<text>John Henry George &quot;Babbacombe&quot; Lee (15 August 1864 – 19 March 1945) was an Englishman famous for surviving three attempts to hang him for murder. Born in Abbotskerswell, Devon, Lee served in the Royal Navy, and was a known thief.

In 1885, he was convicted of the murder of his employer, Emma Keyse, at her home at Babbacombe Bay near Torquay on 15 November 1884, with a knife. The evidence was weak and circumstantial, amounting to little more than Lee having been the only male in the house at the time of the murder, his previous criminal record, and being found with an unexplained cut on his arm. Despite this and his claim of innocence, he was sentenced to hang. After he survived three attempts at hanging, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He became popularly known as &quot;the man they couldn&#x27;t hang&quot;.

== Attempted execution and aftermath ==
On 23 February 1885, three attempts were made to carry out Lee&#x27;s execution at Exeter Prison. All ended in failure, as the trapdoor of the scaffold failed to open despite being carefully tested by the executioner, James Berry, beforehand. The medical officer refused to take any further part in the proceedings, and they were stopped.

Berry provides a detailed account of the failed execution in his memoirs, &quot;My Experiences as an Executioner&quot;, noting that the trapdoor was adjusted with a saw and axe between the attempted executions, although in Berry&#x27;s memoirs and letter to the Under-Sheriff he only mentions two attempted executions.

As a result, home secretary Sir William Harcourt commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. The Home Office ordered an investigation into the failure of the apparatus, and it was discovered that when the gallows was moved from the old infirmary into the coach house, the draw bar was slightly misaligned. As a result the hinges of the trapdoor bound and did not drop cleanly through. Lee continued to petition successive Home Secretaries and was finally released in 1907.

The only other man in history known to have survived three hanging attempts was Joseph Samuel, in September 1803.

An alternative theory, raised by Ernest Bowen-Rowlands in his book &quot;In the Light of the Law&quot;, suggests that the trap was blocked by a wooden wedge that was inserted by a prisoner working on the scaffold, and removed when the apparatus was tested. Note that Bowen-Rowlands only cites an anonymous &quot;well-known person&quot;, citing an equally anonymous prisoner&#x27;s confession, and this would contrast with Berry&#x27;s reputation (noted by prison governors and surgeons) as a meticulous professional.

== Later years and identifications ==
After his release, Lee seems to have exploited his notoriety, supporting himself through lecturing on his life, even becoming the subject of a silent film. Accounts of his whereabouts after 1916 are somewhat confused, and one researcher even speculated that in later years there was more than one man claiming to be Lee. It was suspected that he died in the Tavistock workhouse sometime during the Second World War. However, more recent research concludes that he died in the United States under the name of &quot;James Lee&quot; in 1945. According to the book &quot;The Man They Could Not Hang&quot;, Lee&#x27;s gravestone was located at Forest Home Cemetery, Milwaukee in 2009.

<doc id="497563" wikidata="Q116291" url="?curid=497563" title="Pierre Prevost (physicist)">
<text>Pierre Prevost (; 3 March 1751 – 8 April 1839) was a Genevan philosopher and physicist. In 1791 he explained Pictet&#x27;s experiment by arguing that all bodies radiate heat, no matter how hot or cold they are.

==Life==
Son of a Protestant clergyman in Geneva in the Republic of Geneva, he was born in that city and was educated for a clerical career. However, he abandoned it for law, and this too he quickly deserted to devote himself to education and to travelling. He became close friends with Jean Jacques Rousseau and, a little later, with Dugald Stewart, having previously distinguished himself as a translator of and commentator on Euripides.

Frederick II of Prussia secured him in 1780 as professor of philosophy and made him member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin. He there became acquainted with Joseph Louis Lagrange and was thus led to turn his attention to physical science.

After some years spent on political economy and on the principles of the fine arts (in connection with which he wrote, for the &quot;Berlin Memoirs&quot;, a remarkable dissertation on poetry) he returned to Geneva and began his work on magnetism and on heat. Interrupted occasionally in his studies by political duties in which he was often called to the front, he remained professor of philosophy at Geneva until he was called in 1810 to the chair of physics. 

He died at Geneva in 1839.

==Work==
Prévost published much on philology, philosophy, and political economy, but he will be remembered mainly for having published, with additions of his own, the &quot;Traité de physique&quot; by Georges-Louis Le Sage, and for his enunciation of the law of exchange in radiation.

His scientific publications included &quot;De l&#x27;Origine des forces magnetiques&quot;, &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;Equilibre du feu&quot;, &quot;Recherches physico-mecaniques sur la chaleur&quot;, and &quot;Essai sur le calorique rayonnant&quot;.

<doc id="497564" wikidata="Q220336" url="?curid=497564" title="Zooropa">
<text>Zooropa is the eighth studio album by Irish rock band U2. Produced by Flood, Brian Eno, and the Edge, it was released on 5 July 1993 on Island Records. Inspired by the band&#x27;s experiences on the Zoo TV Tour, &quot;Zooropa&quot; expanded on many of the tour&#x27;s themes of technology and media oversaturation. The record was a continuation of the group&#x27;s experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, in 1991.

U2 began writing and recording &quot;Zooropa&quot; in Dublin in February 1993, during a six-month break between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The record was originally intended as an EP to promote the &quot;Zooropa&quot; leg of the tour that was to begin in May 1993, but during the sessions, the group decided to extend the record to a full-length album. Pressed for time, U2 wrote and recorded at a rapid pace, with songs originating from many sources, including leftover material from the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; sessions. The album was not completed in time for the tour&#x27;s resumption, forcing the band to travel between Dublin and their tour destinations in May to complete mixing and recording.

&quot;Zooropa&quot; received generally favourable reviews from critics. Despite none of its three singles—&quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;Lemon&quot;, and &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot;—being hits consistently across regions, the record sold well upon release, charting in the top ten of 26 countries. The album&#x27;s charting duration and lifetime sales of 7 million copies, however, were less than those of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. In 1994, &quot;Zooropa&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Although the record was a success and music journalists view it as one of the group&#x27;s most creative works, the band regard it with mixed feelings.

==Background==

U2 regained critical favour with their commercially successful 1991 album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and the supporting Zoo TV Tour in 1992. The record was a musical reinvention for the group, incorporating influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music into their sound. The tour was an elaborately staged multimedia event that satirised television and the viewing public&#x27;s overstimulation by attempting to instill &quot;sensory overload&quot; in its audience. The band finished 1992 with one of their most successful years, selling 2.9 million concert tickets and reaching 10 million copies sold for &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. Their 73 North American concerts from the year grossed US$67 million, easily the highest amount for any touring artist in 1992.

The group concluded the North American &quot;Outside Broadcast&quot; leg of the tour on 25 November 1992, leaving them with a six-month break before the tour resumed in Europe in May 1993 with the &quot;Zooropa&quot; leg. Rather than use the time to rest, lead vocalist Bono and guitarist the Edge were keen to record new material. Following a hectic year of touring, the two did not want to settle back into domestic life. Bono said, &quot;We thought we could live a normal life and then go back on the road [in May 1993]. But it turns out that your whole way of thinking, your whole body has been geared toward the madness of Zoo TV... So we decided to put the madness on a record. Everybody&#x27;s head was spinning, so we thought, why not keep that momentum going...?&quot; The Edge also wished to distract himself from the emotions he was feeling after separating from his wife during the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; sessions in 1991. The other members, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., ultimately agreed to join them for recording.
==Recording and production==
After handling audio engineering for the recording of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, Robbie Adams was invited by U2 to manage sound mixing on the Zoo TV Tour. Adams also recorded the group&#x27;s tour soundchecks. In January 1993, the band asked him to compile these recordings and create loops of interesting parts that they could play to in the studio. After Adams spent a few weeks assembling loops, the group entered The Factory in Dublin that February to begin composing rough demos. Bono and the Edge were most involved during this initial demoing process, which lasted six weeks. Audio services company Audio Engineering installed recording equipment at the Factory that included a Soundcraft 6000 mixing console, an Otari MTR100 multi-track recorder, and four Neve console modules. The company also provided outboard gear such as a UREI 1176 Peak Limiter, a dbx 120X-DS subharmonic synthesizer, two Summit and two LA compressors, a Focusrite 115HD equaliser, a Yamaha SPX1000 multi-effects unit, Lexicon PCM-70 and AMS RMX-16 reverb units, and Yamaha NS-10 and EGV monitor speakers.
The group employed Brian Eno and his assisting partner Mark &quot;Flood&quot; Ellis—both of whom worked on &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;—to produce the sessions; long-time Eno collaborator Daniel Lanois was busy promoting his solo album and was unavailable. Similar to the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; sessions, Eno worked two-week shifts. The group often gave him in-progress songs to adjust and to which he could add his own personality. Initially, the band did not have a clear plan for how they would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if what we&#x27;re doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into the demos for the next U2 album.&quot; The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: &quot;We&#x27;ve got a bit of time off. We&#x27;ve got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let&#x27;s do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It&#x27;ll be a fan thing. It&#x27;ll be cool.&quot;

Soon after the sessions commenced, Bono pushed for the band to work towards a full-length album. The Edge was initially hesitant, but saw the opportunity as a challenge to quickly record an album before returning to tour and prove the band had not become spoiled by the luxury of ample recording time. Additionally, Bono and the band&#x27;s manager Paul McGuinness had discussed the possibility of releasing a &quot;one-two punch&quot; of records since the beginning of the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; sessions. In early March, U2 reached a consensus to work towards a full-length album. Much like they had for the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; sessions, the band split work between two studios at once; Adams operated a Soundtracs mixing console at The Factory, while Flood used an SSL console at the newly relocated Windmill Lane Studios.

Due to the time limit, U2 were forced to write and record songs at a more rapid pace. They continued their long-time practice of jamming in the studio. Eno used an eraseable whiteboard to give instructions and cues to the band while they jammed; he pointed at chords and various commands, such as &quot;hold&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, and &quot;change back&quot;, to direct their performances. Flood recorded the material, while Eno alternated between performing with U2 and joining Flood in the control room. At the end of a given week, Eno and Flood compared their notes and compiled the week&#x27;s best jams onto a cassette for the band to listen to. The producers edited together their favourite sections of the jams and then discussed the arrangements with the group. U2 suggested alterations and added lyrics and melodies, before performing to the edited arrangements. To record all of the band&#x27;s material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called &quot;fatting&quot;, which allowed them to achieve more than 48 tracks of audio by using a 24-track analogue recording, a Fostex D20 timecode-capable DAT recorder, and an Adams Smith Zeta Three synchroniser; Adams went through 180 two-hour DAT tapes during the recording sessions. The production crew faced issues with audio spill at The Factory, as all group members recorded in the same room as the mixing desk and Bono frequently sang in-progress lyrics that would need to be replaced. Gobos and wood booths were built to separate the performers&#x27; sounds as much as possible.
Songs originated from and were inspired by a variety of sources. &quot;Zooropa&quot; was the result of combining two separate pieces of music together, one of which the band discovered while reviewing recordings of tour soundchecks. The verse melody to &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot; and an instrumental backing track that became &quot;Numb&quot; were originally from the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; sessions. &quot;Babyface&quot;, &quot;Dirty Day&quot;, &quot;Lemon&quot;, and &quot;The Wanderer&quot; were written during the &quot;Zooropa&quot; sessions. Country singer Johnny Cash recorded vocals for &quot;The Wanderer&quot; during a visit to Dublin, and although Bono recorded his own vocals for the song, he preferred Cash&#x27;s version. The production crew and the band debated which version to include on the record. Throughout the sessions, U2 were undecided on a unifying musical style for the release, and as a result, they maintained three potential track listings—one for the best songs, one for &quot;vibes&quot;, and one for a soundtrack album. Bono suggested editing the best segments of songs together to create a montage.

As May&#x27;s &quot;Zooropa&quot; tour leg approached, U2 continued to record while simultaneously rehearsing for the tour. Their time limit prevented them from working on live arrangements for any of the new songs. Despite the sessions&#x27; rapid pace, the album was not completed by the time they had to resume touring. Moreover, Flood and Eno had to begin work on other projects. The Edge remembers everyone was telling the group, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s an EP. You did good but there&#x27;s a lot more work needed to finish some of these songs.&quot; However, the band did not want to shelve the project, as they believed they were on a &quot;creative roll&quot; and that they would be in a completely different frame of mind if they revisited the material six months later.

The group&#x27;s solution was to fly back and forth between Dublin and their concert destinations for about ten days to finish recording and mixing at night and during their off-days. Clayton called the process &quot;about the craziest thing you could do to yourself&quot;, while Mullen said of it, &quot;It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad.&quot; McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The group simultaneously used three separate rooms at Windmill Lane to mix, overdub, and edit. Adams said the hectic approach meant &quot;there was never anybody sitting around waiting or doing nothing&quot;. Flood called the period one of &quot;absolute lunacy&quot;. Eschewing console automation, the engineers adopted a &quot;live performance&quot; attitude to mixing, based on past experiences with Lanois. The band and production crew sat in on the mixing and offered encouragement, creating, as Adams put it, &quot;a kind of cheerleader thing. It all induces a nervous energy in you and creates a lot of pressure, and gives the whole thing a performance feel.&quot; Flood had to depart about a week prior to the completion of mixing due to prior obligations to produce Nine Inch Nails in Los Angeles. The recording of &quot;Zooropa&quot; concluded on 14 May 1993.

In the final weeks, the band decided to exclude the traditional rock songs and guitar-driven tracks they had written in favour of an &quot;album of disjointed, experimental pop&quot;. The Edge received a production credit—his first on a U2 record—for the extra level of responsibility he assumed for the album. Twenty songs were recorded during the sessions, but ultimately 10 were chosen for the final track listing. One piece that was left off the record was &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, which featured somber lyrics written by Bono in response to the Bosnian War and was previewed prior to the album&#x27;s release. Other tracks that were left off the album included &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot;, &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;, &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot;, and &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;. The first was later released as a single from the &quot;Batman Forever&quot; soundtrack in 1995, and the latter three were included on the band&#x27;s following studio album, &quot;Pop&quot;, in 1997.

==Composition==

===Music===
With an even more &quot;European&quot; musical aesthetic than &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, &quot;Zooropa&quot; is a further departure from the group&#x27;s &quot;rootsy&quot; sound of the late 1980s. Much like how the group embraced technology for the Zoo TV Tour, they utilized technology as a musical resource to a greater extent on &quot;Zooropa&quot;. The record exhibits additional influences from alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music—it is more synthesised than U2&#x27;s past work, featuring various sound effects, audio loops, and use of synthesisers. In addition to the Edge playing synthesiser, Brian Eno received credit for the instrument on six tracks.

The Edge&#x27;s guitar playing on &quot;Zooropa&quot; marks a further shift away from his trademark style, highlighted by a heavier reliance on guitar effects and the songs&#x27; reduced emphasis on his guitar parts. The danceable &quot;Lemon&quot;, called a &quot;space-age German disco&quot; by Stephen Thomas Erlewine, features a gated guitar part. The distorted &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car&quot; was described by Bono as &quot;industrial blues&quot;. The instrumentation of the closing song, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, consists primarily of a synthesised bassline and was described by the group as resembling the &quot;ultimate Holiday Inn band from hell&quot;. The song was sequenced as the final track because U2 wanted to end the album on a &quot;musical joke&quot;. 

Similar to how the Zoo TV Tour display screens sampled video footage from television programming, a number of songs from &quot;Zooropa&quot; sample audio. The introduction to the title track, &quot;Zooropa&quot;, contains a noisy collage of indecipherable human voices from radio signals—credited to the &quot;advertising world&quot;—played over sustained synthesiser chords. The industrial-influenced &quot;Numb&quot; features a noisy backdrop of sampled, rhythmic noises, including &quot;arcade sounds&quot;, a Walkman rewinding, and a Hitler Youth boy banging a bass drum in the 1935 propaganda film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car&quot; begins with a snippet of fanfare from &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Favourite Songs&quot; and samples MC 900 Ft. Jesus&#x27; song &quot;The City Sleeps&quot;.

The vocals on &quot;Zooropa&quot; are a further departure from U2&#x27;s previous style. As Jon Pareles described, Bono &quot;underplays his lung power&quot; throughout the record, in contrast to his impassioned, belting vocals from past work. Additionally, in songs such as &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;, Bono sings in an operatic falsetto he calls the &quot;Fat Lady&quot; voice. Two tracks feature other people on lead vocals: for &quot;Numb&quot;, the Edge provides lead vocals in the form of a droning, monotonous list of &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; commands; for &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, country musician Johnny Cash sings lead vocals, juxtaposing the electronic nature of the song with his haggard voice.

===Lyrics===

Bono is credited as the sole lyricist for eight of the ten songs, while the Edge received sole credit for &quot;Numb&quot;. The duo share credits for the lyrics to &quot;Dirty Day&quot;. Technology is a common theme on &quot;Zooropa&quot;, inspired by the group&#x27;s experiences on the Zoo TV Tour. Jon Pareles wrote that the songs are about how &quot;media messages infect characters&#x27; souls&quot;, while music journalist David Browne said the songs are concerned with &quot;emotional fracturing in the techno-tronic age&quot;. Critic Robert Hilburn interpreted the album as U2 probing into what they saw as the &quot;disillusionment of the modern age&quot;.

&quot;Zooropa&quot; is set amongst neon signs of a brightly lit futuristic city. In the song&#x27;s introduction, background voices ask, &quot;What do you want?&quot; In response to the question, the lyrics in the first three verses consist of various advertising slogans, including, &quot;Better by design&quot;, &quot;Be all that you can be&quot;, and &quot;Vorsprung durch technik&quot;. Critic Parry Gettelman interpreted these lines as meaning to &quot;signify the emptiness of modern, godless life&quot;. In the song&#x27;s second half, the theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced, particularly in the lines &quot;I have no compass / And I have no map&quot;.

&quot;Babyface&quot; is about a man practicing his obsessive love for a celebrity by manipulating her image on a TV recording. &quot;Lemon&quot;, inspired by an old video of Bono&#x27;s late mother in a lemon-coloured dress, describes man&#x27;s attempts to preserve time through technology. This is reflected in lines such as, &quot;A man makes a picture / A moving picture / Through the light projected he can see himself up close&quot;. The lyrics to &quot;Numb&quot; are a series of &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; commands, amidst a noisy backdrop of sounds. The Edge notes that the song was inspired by one of the themes of Zoo TV, &quot;that sense that you were getting bombarded with so much that you actually were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you&quot;.

In contrast to the technology-inspired lyrics of many songs, others had more domestic themes. &quot;The First Time&quot; was Bono&#x27;s interpretation of the story of the Prodigal son, but in his version, the son decides not to return home. Similarly, &quot;Dirty Day&quot; was written about a character who abandons his family and returns years later to meet his son. Many of the track&#x27;s lyrics are taken from phrases that Bono&#x27;s father commonly used, such as &quot;No blood is thicker than ink&quot; and &quot;It won&#x27;t last kissing time&quot;. &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot; is a love song written for an abused woman.

Bono based his lyrics to &quot;The Wanderer&quot; on the Old Testament&#x27;s Book of Ecclesiastes, and he modeled the song&#x27;s character after the book&#x27;s narrator, &quot;The Preacher&quot;. In the song, the narrator wanders through a post-apocalyptic world &quot;in search of experience&quot;, sampling all facets of human culture and hoping to find meaning in life. Bono described the song as an &quot;antidote to the &quot;Zooropa&quot; manifesto of uncertainty&quot;, and he believes it presents a possible solution to the uncertainty expressed earlier on the album.

==Packaging and title==
The sleeve was designed by Works Associates of Dublin under the direction of Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2&#x27;s album covers. Brian Williams was the graphic designer and created the digital images and layout. Inspired by the Zoo TV Tour&#x27;s &quot;highly charged electronic TV images in all of their saturated colours and fizz&quot;, Works Associates conceived a &quot;kind of electronic flag&quot; for &quot;Zooropa&quot;. The cover features a sketch of the circle of stars from the Flag of Europe with an &quot;astrobaby&quot; drawing in the center. The illustration, created by Shaughn McGrath, was an alteration of the &quot;graffiti babyface&quot; by Charlie Whisker that was originally on the face of the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; compact disc/vinyl record. The cover&#x27;s drawing was meant to represent an urban legend of a Soviet cosmonaut supposedly left floating in orbit for weeks after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the background is a montage of blurred images, similar to the arrangement of images on &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;″s sleeve. The images include shots of a woman&#x27;s face and mouth, as well as photographs of European leaders, including Vladimir Lenin, Benito Mussolini, and Nicolae Ceauşescu. These images are obscured by distorted purple text comprising the names of songs planned for the record that were provided to Works Associates during the sleeve design process. However, the album&#x27;s track listing was eventually changed and the titles of several songs withheld from the album were accidentally left in the cover image; the songs include &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;, &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot;, and &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot;. Author Višnja Cogan described this text as giving the impression of a &quot;torn veil&quot;.

&quot;Zooropa&quot; was named for the &quot;Zooropa&quot; leg of the Zoo TV Tour, which began in May 1993 while the band completed the record. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;zoo&quot; (from Zoo TV Tour and &quot;Zoo Station&quot;) and &quot;Europa&quot;. During the album&#x27;s production, one of the proposed titles was &quot;Squeaky&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Zooropa&quot; completed U2&#x27;s contractual obligation to Island Records, and to PolyGram, the multinational that purchased Island in 1989. Although the group were free to sign a new contract elsewhere, their strong relationship with the label and its founder Chris Blackwell prompted the band to remain with Island/Polygram by signing a long-term, six-album deal in June 1993. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; estimated that the deal was worth US$60 million to U2, making them the highest-paid rock group ever. At the time, the group were cognizant of several emerging technologies that would potentially impact the delivery and transmission of music to consumers in the following years. Author Bill Flanagan speculated, &quot;Record stores could become obsolete as music is delivered over cable, telephone wires, or satellite transmissions directly into consumers&#x27; homes.&quot; With uncertainty over the future of these technologies and the implications of entertainment and telecommunications companies merging, the band negotiated with Island that the division of their earnings from future transmission systems would be flexible and decided upon at a relevant time. U2 toyed with the idea of releasing &quot;Zooropa&quot; as an interactive audio-video presentation in lieu of conventional physical formats, but the deadline imposed by the Zoo TV Tour prevented the band from realising this idea.

U2&#x27;s delivery of &quot;Zooropa&quot; in late May caught PolyGram somewhat off-guard, because they were not expecting a new album by the group for several years. With &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, PolyGram had approximately six months to market the record and plan its release strategy, but the sudden completion of &quot;Zooropa&quot; necessitated a more hurried promotional plan. PolyGram president/CEO Rick Dobbis explained: &quot;For the last one, we prepared for six months. It was like a marathon. But this is like a sprint, and that is the spirit it was made in. The band was so excited about it, they sprinted to complete the album before the ... tour. We want to bring it to the street with that same spirit.&quot; Island/PolyGram&#x27;s and U2&#x27;s marketing for &quot;Zooropa&quot; was intended to focus less on singles and more on the record as a whole, and ultimately, only three singles were released, compared to &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;″s five singles. The first single &quot;Numb&quot; was released in June 1993 exclusively on VHS as a &quot;video single&quot;. The music video was directed by Kevin Godley. The song peaked at number seven in Australia and number nine in Canada, while reaching number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, it failed to chart on the singles charts in the UK or US.

&quot;Zooropa&quot; was released on 5 July 1993, during the Zooropa leg of the Zoo TV Tour. An initial shipment of 1.6 million copies was made available in stores at the time of release. Two additional commercial singles were released from the album. &quot;Lemon&quot; received a limited commercial release in North America, Australia, and Japan in September 1993. The single peaked at number six in Australia and number three on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The final commercial single was &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot;, released worldwide on 22 November 1993. It was the album&#x27;s most successful single, topping the Irish Singles Chart and peaking at number five in Australia, number six in New Zealand, number four in the UK, and number 61 in the US—making it the record&#x27;s only single to chart on the UK Singles Chart and Hot 100. &quot;Zooropa&quot; was released as a promotional single in Mexico and the United States.

===Reissues===
In October 2011, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was reissued to commemorate its 20th anniversary; CD copies of &quot;Zooropa&quot; were included in the &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Über Deluxe&quot; editions of the release. Continuing a campaign by U2 to reissue all of their records on vinyl, &quot;Zooropa&quot; was re-released on two 180-gram vinyl records on 27 July 2018. Remastered under the Edge&#x27;s direction, the reissue included two remixes to commemorate the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary: &quot;Lemon (The Perfecto Mix)&quot; and &quot;Numb (Gimme Some More Dignity Mix)&quot;.
 Each copy includes a download card that can be used to redeem a digital copy of the album. To commemorate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, in October 2023 the group released a limited-edition yellow vinyl pressing of the album containing a new photo from 1993 on the inner gatefold.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===

&quot;Zooropa&quot; received generally favourable reviews from critics. Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote in his four-star review that the album was &quot;a daring, imaginative coda to &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;&quot; and that &quot;it is varied and vigorously experimental, but its charged mood of giddy anarchy suffused with barely suppressed dread provides a compelling, unifying thread&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; wrote a positive review, commenting that the record &quot;sounds mostly like a band shedding its skin, trying on different selves for size&quot;. The review said the album &quot;has the feel of real collectivity&quot;, praising the cohesiveness of the individual band members&#x27; playing. The review concluded by saying &quot;Zooropa&quot; &quot;indicates U2 might be worthy of whatever absurd mutations the &#x27;90s throw our way&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the group for transforming themselves and becoming &quot;raucous, playful and ready to kick its old habits&quot;. Pareles enjoyed the sonics and electronic effects that made the &quot;sound of a straightforward four-man band ... hard to find&quot;, and he commented that &quot;The new songs seem destined not for stadiums ... but for late-night radio shows and private listenings through earphones.&quot; The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; gave the record a rating of three-out-of-five stars, commenting, &quot;Although U2 leans heavily on the electronic sound of contemporary dance music, the rhythm tracks on &quot;Zooropa&quot; are less than propulsive.&quot; The review said that Eno&#x27;s production and the electronic flourishes made the album interesting, but that ultimately, &quot;there&#x27;s nothing especially hummable&quot; and &quot;the songs are not very memorable&quot;.

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;Zooropa&quot; an &quot;A&quot;, calling it &quot;harried, spontaneous-sounding, and ultimately exhilarating album&quot;. Browne judged it to sound &quot;messy&quot; and &quot;disconnected&quot;, but clarified &quot;that sense of incoherence is the point&quot; in the context of the record&#x27;s technology themes. He concluded, &quot;For an album that wasn&#x27;t meant to be an album, it&#x27;s quite an album.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the record a maximum score of four stars. In two separate articles, he said that it &quot;captured the anxious, even paranoid tone of the Zoo TV Tour&quot; so much so that &quot;it stands as the first tour album that doesn&#x27;t include any of the songs from the tour&quot; and yet sounds like a &quot;souvenir&quot; of Zoo TV. In a positive review, Jim Sullivan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called the album a &quot;creative stretch&quot;, noting that the band experimented more yet retained their recognizable sound. He commented that the group&#x27;s &quot;yearning anthemic reach&quot; and &quot;obvious, slinky pop charm&quot; were replaced with &quot;darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness&quot;. Paul Du Noyer of &quot;Q&quot; gave &quot;Zooropa&quot; a score of four-out-of-five stars, finding a &quot;freewheeling feel of going with the flow&quot; throughout the album and calling it &quot;rootless and loose, restless and unsettled&quot;. For Du Noyer, U2 sounded &quot;monstrously tight as a performing unit and fluidly inventive as composers, so the results transcend the merely experimental&quot;.

A review from &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; was more critical, saying that the album started as an EP and &quot;just got longer but not necessarily better&quot;. The publication called it &quot;more perplexing than challenging&quot; and commented that it &quot;sounds like the biggest band in the world having one of the biggest, strangest mid-life crises&quot;. Jim DeRogatis of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave the record a three-and-a-half star review, calling it &quot;inconsistent&quot;, but admitting &quot;it&#x27;s satisfying and surprising to hear a band of U2&#x27;s status being so playful, experimental, and downright weird&quot;. Robert Christgau gave the album a B−, calling it &quot;half an Eno album&quot; in the same manner that David Bowie&#x27;s Eno-produced albums &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; were, but saying, &quot;The difference is that Bowie and Eno were fresher in 1977 than Bono and Eno are today.&quot; The Irish media were more critical in their reviews of the album; George Byrne of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; said, &quot;The songs sound like they were knocked up in double-quick time and with about as much thought put into the lyrics as goes into a DJ&#x27;s timecheck&quot;. Byrne remarked that the record resembles &quot;a lot of mickey-taking over a variety of drum patterns&quot;. In a retrospective, four-star review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that &quot;most of the record is far more daring than its predecessor&quot;. For him, although there were moments that the album was &quot;unfocused and meandering ... the best moments of &quot;Zooropa&quot; rank among U2&#x27;s most inspired and rewarding music&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Zooropa&quot; finished in 9th place on the &quot;Best Albums&quot; list from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1993 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. At the 36th Annual Grammy Awards, it won the award for Best Alternative Music Album. In his acceptance speech, Bono sarcastically mocked the &quot;alternative&quot; characterisation the album received and used a profanity on live television: &quot;I think I&#x27;d like to give a message to the young people of America. And that is: We shall continue to abuse our position and fuck up the mainstream.&quot; &quot;Zooropa&quot; was also nominated for Album of the Year at the 1993 &quot;GAFFA&quot; Awards in Denmark.

==Commercial performance==
The album performed well commercially, debuting at number one in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland. It also reached number one in the Netherlands, Italy, Japan, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and Iceland. In the US, the album spent its first two weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the top spot, staying in the top 10 for seven weeks. In its first week on sale, &quot;Zooropa&quot; sold 377,000 copies in the US, the group&#x27;s best debut in the country to that point. The album reached the top 10 in 26 countries. 

Despite reaching impressive peak positions, &quot;Zooropa&quot; had a shorter stay on the music charts than &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; did. In total, &quot;Zooropa&quot; spent 40 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, 61 fewer weeks than &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. &quot;Zooropa&quot; spent 34 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, nine of which were in the top ten, but it charted in the UK for 59 fewer weeks than &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. 

According to Nielsen Soundscan, &quot;Zooropa&quot; sold 1.8 million copies in the US in 1993, the 22nd-highest total in the country that year, and by February 1997 sales in the US had reached 2.1 million copies. The album has been certified 2× Platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America, 3× Platinum in Australia, Platinum in the UK, and 4× Platinum in both New Zealand and Canada. To date, it has sold more than 7 million copies.

==Zoo TV Tour==
The band began the Zoo TV Tour in February 1992 in support of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised television and the viewing public&#x27;s overstimulation by attempting to instill &quot;sensory overload&quot; in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases. Live satellite link-ups, channel surfing, crank calls, and video confessionals were incorporated into the shows.

The &quot;Zooropa&quot; album was released in July 1993, halfway through the Zooropa leg of the tour. Of the 157 shows the band played during the Zoo TV Tour, approximately 30 of them were after the release of &quot;Zooropa&quot;. Many of the album&#x27;s songs found permanent places in the shows&#x27; set lists. &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car&quot; were performed with Bono in his MacPhisto persona, during encores of the Zoomerang Leg of the tour. &quot;Dirty Day&quot; was also played on this leg after the acoustic set. &quot;Numb&quot; was performed with the Edge playing guitar and on lead vocals, with Mullen performing backing vocals while drumming. &quot;Zooropa&quot; was played only three times and &quot;Babyface&quot; twice more at the same shows on the &quot;Zooropa&quot; leg, but they were cut out of the set list after the band were displeased with how they sounded live. &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot; was performed acoustically for the Zooropa and Zoomerang legs.
==Legacy==
Although the record was a success, in the years following its release, the group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances. Bono said, &quot;I thought of &quot;Zooropa&quot; at the time as a work of genius. I really thought our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and this was our &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. I was a little wrong about that. The truth is our pop disciplines were letting us down. We didn&#x27;t create hits. We didn&#x27;t quite deliver the songs. And what would &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; be without the pop songs?&quot; The Edge said that he did not think the songs were &quot;potent&quot;, further stating, &quot;I never thought of &quot;Zooropa&quot; as anything more than an interlude... but a great one, as interludes go. By far our most interesting.&quot; Clayton said, &quot;It&#x27;s an odd record and a favourite of mine.&quot; In 2005, Bono claimed that the album&#x27;s track &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot; is &quot;perhaps the greatest U2 song&quot;.
After the release of &quot;Zooropa&quot;, David Bowie praised the band, writing, &quot;[U2] might be all shamrocks and deutsche marks to some, but I feel that they are one of the few rock bands even attempting to hint at a world which will continue past the next great wall—the year 2000.&quot; In 2023, Steven Hyden of &quot;Uproxx&quot; echoed Bowie&#x27;s sentiments in a 30th anniversary retrospective on &quot;Zooropa&quot;: &quot;U2 dared to imagine something that in the present moment seems to be of little common interest: the future... I mean the future as it stood in the &#x27;90s, when people looked beyond the 20th century and envisioned a radically different world emerging from a period of political and cultural uncertainty.&quot; Hyden felt that U2 had been guided by uncertainty for the record, calling it &quot;artistically successful in that it set out to evoke an increasingly incoherent world by making anyone who heard it also feel incoherent&quot;. He believed that unlike other alternative rock albums from 1993, &quot;Zooropa&quot; was even more relevant in 2023 than when first released, and that it had not become dated: &quot;And that&#x27;s because the world U2 thought they were commenting on in 1993 was in reality just coming into existence, and it&#x27;s the world we&#x27;re living in now.&quot; He added, &quot;Above all, &quot;Zooropa&quot; summons the modern desire to unplug from the grid and reconnect with something &#x27;real&#x27; or &#x27;authentic.&#x27;&quot;

Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; said in 2002, &quot;the alien territory of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and &quot;Zooropa&quot; cemented U2&#x27;s relevance and enhanced its cachet as intrepid explorers&quot;. Neil McCormick wrote about &quot;Zooropa&quot;, &quot;It feels like a minor work, and generally U2 don&#x27;t do minor. But if you&#x27;re not going to make the Big Statement, you&#x27;re maybe going to come up with something that has the oxygen of pop music.&quot; In 1997, Ann Powers of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Zooropa&quot; took U2 as far from the monastic mysticism of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; as they could go. It freed U2 from itself.&quot; In 2013, the magazine published an article by Rob Harvilla that called &quot;Zooropa&quot; the album that almost killed U2&#x27;s career. Harvilla referred to the album as &quot;a weird blip best understood as a portent of the burps that followed, a mega-band dipping a big toe into murky art-rock waters before belly-flopping completely with &quot;Pop&quot; and its subsequent crass, costly, cred-depleting tour misadventures.&quot; While lamenting the band&#x27;s latter-career creative output, he added: &quot;Mark this record, then, as a celebration of a time when U2 was still musically daring; give &#x27;Lemon&#x27; credit at least for successfully trolling you. It is the maddening, befuddling, discomfiting, somewhat ill-advised, occasionally inspired sound of very famous, very difficult men trying on some ill-fitting clothes.&quot; In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the record at number 61 on its list of &quot;100 Best Albums of the Nineties&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, MD5CRK was a volunteer computing effort (similar to distributed.net) launched by Jean-Luc Cooke and his company, CertainKey Cryptosystems, to demonstrate that the MD5 message digest algorithm is insecure by finding a collision two messages that produce the same MD5 hash. The project went live on March 1, 2004. The project ended on August 24, 2004, after researchers independently demonstrated a technique for generating collisions in MD5 using analytical methods by Xiaoyun Wang, Feng, Xuejia Lai, and Yu. CertainKey awarded a 10,000 Canadian Dollar prize to Wang, Feng, Lai and Yu for their discovery.
A technique called Floyd&#x27;s cycle-finding algorithm was used to try to find a collision for MD5. The algorithm can be described by analogy with a random walk. Using the principle that any function with a finite number of possible outputs placed in a feedback loop will cycle, one can use a relatively small amount of memory to store outputs with particular structures and use them as &quot;markers&quot; to better detect when a marker has been &quot;passed&quot; before. These markers are called &quot;distinguished points&quot;, the point where two inputs produce the same output is called a &quot;collision point&quot;. MD5CRK considered any point whose first 32 bits were zeroes to be a distinguished point.

The expected time to find a collision is not equal to formula_1 where formula_2 is the number of bits in the digest output. It is in fact formula_3, where formula_4 is the number of function outputs collected.

For this project, the probability of success after formula_4 MD5 computations can be approximated by: formula_6.

The expected number of computations required to produce a collision in the 128-bit MD5 message digest function is thus: formula_7

To give some perspective to this, using Virginia Tech&#x27;s System X with a maximum performance of 12.25 Teraflops, it would take approximately formula_8 seconds or about 3 weeks. Or for commodity processors at 2 gigaflops it would take 6,000 machines approximately the same amount of time.

<doc id="497566" wikidata="Q8346457" url="?curid=497566" title="Euphuism">
<text>Euphuism is an elegant literary style that was briefly in fashion during the Elizabethan era. The euphuism style employed the frequent use of alliteration, antithesis, balance, and simile, with references to nature and mythological tales. Euphuism was fashionable in the 1580s, especially in the Elizabethan court. Its origins can be traced back to Spanish writer Antonio de Guevara, whose ornate, manierist courtesan prose became very popular throughout Europe, and whose work &quot;The Clock of the Princes&quot;, translated into English in 1557 by Thomas North, reached its peak in popularity during Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign. 

==&quot;Euphues&quot; (1580)==
&quot;Euphues&quot; (εὐφυής) is the Greek for &quot;graceful, witty&quot;. John Lyly published the works &quot;Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit&quot; (1578) and &quot;Euphues and his England&quot; (1580). Both works illustrated the intellectual fashions and favourite themes of Renaissance society— in a highly artificial and mannered style. The plots are unimportant, existing merely as structural elements on which to display conversations, discourses and letters mostly concerning the subject of love. Its essential features had already appeared in such works as George Pettie&#x27;s &quot;A Petite Pallace of Pettie his pleasure&quot; (1576), in sermon literature, and Latin tracts. Lyly perfected the distinctive rhetorical devices on which the style was based.

==Principles==
The euphuistic sentence followed principles of balance and antithesis to their extremes, purposely using the latter regardless of sense. John Lyly set up three basic structural principles:

*phrases of equal length that appear in succession
*the balance of key verbal elements in successive sentences
*the correspondence of sounds and syllables, especially between words that are already balanced against each other

==Examples==

&quot;It is virtue, yea virtue, gentlemen, that maketh gentlemen; that maketh the poor rich, the base-born noble, the subject a sovereign, the deformed beautiful, the sick whole, the weak strong, the most miserable most happy. There are two principal and peculiar gifts in the nature of man, knowledge and reason; the one commandeth, and the other obeyeth: these things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can change, neither the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate, neither sickness abate, neither age abolish&quot;. (&quot;Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit&quot;)

&quot;Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others&#x27; faults, than by repentance of thine own follies?&quot; (&quot;Euphues, 1, lecture by the wise Neapolitan)
&quot;Can any treasure in this transitory pilgrimmage be of more value than a friend? In whose bosom thou mayest sleep secure without fear, whom thou mayest make partner of all thy secrets without suspicion of fraud, and partaker of all thy misfortune without mistrust of fleeting. Who will account thy bale his bane, thy mishap his misery, the pricking of thy finger the piercing of his heart.&quot; (Euphues)
&quot;How frantic are those lovers which are carried away with the gay glistering of the fine face? The beauty whereof is parched with the summer&#x27;s blaze and chipped with the winter&#x27;s blast: which is of so short continuance, that it fadeth before one perceive it flourish&quot;. (Euphues&#x27; after-dinner speech to the &#x27;coy&#x27; Neapolitan ladies on whether the qualities of the mind or the composition of the man are more worthy).
&quot;Time hath weaned me from my mother&#x27;s teat, and age rid me from my father&#x27;s correction&quot;. (Lucilla, considering her father&#x27;s reaction in abandoning her fiancé Philanthus for Euphues).
&quot;A sharp sore hath a short cure&quot; (Euphues)
&quot;As they be hard to be won without trial of great faith, so are they hard to be lost without great cause of fickleness&quot;. (Euphues to Lucilla on the quality of &#x27;fervency&#x27; in women).
&quot;But alas Euphues, what truth can there be found in a traveller? What stay in a stranger? Whose words and bodies both watch but for a wind, whose feet are ever fleeting, whose faith plighted on the shore, is turned to perjury when they hoist sail&quot;. (Lucilla to Euphues).

==Legacy==
Many critics did not appreciate Lyly&#x27;s deliberate excesses. Philip Sidney and Gabriel Harvey castigated his style, as did Aldous Huxley in his book &quot;On the Margin: Notes and Essays&quot;, who wrote, &quot;Take away from Lyly his erudition and his passion for antithesis, and you have Mrs. Ros.&quot;

Lyly&#x27;s style, however, influenced Shakespeare, who satirised it in speeches by Polonius and Osric in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and the florid language of the courtly lovers in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;; Beatrice and Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; also made use of it, as did Richard and Lady Anne in &quot;Richard III&quot;. It was taken up by the Elizabethan writers Robert Greene, Thomas Lodge and Barnabe Rich. Walter Scott satirised it in the character of Sir Piercie Shafton in &quot;The Monastery&quot;, while Charles Kingsley defended &quot;Euphues&quot; in &quot;Westward Ho!&quot;.

==Contemporary equivalents in other languages==
Euphuism was not particular to Britain, nor a manifestation of some social structure or artistic opportunity unique to that country. There were equivalents in other major European languages, each of which was called by a different name: culteranismo in Spain, Marinismo in Italy, and préciosité in France, for example.

<doc id="497567" wikidata="Q1208039" url="?curid=497567" title="Agumon">
<text>is a fictional character from the Japanese multimedia franchise &quot;Digimon&quot;. It is a reptile-like Digimon who has appeared in various parts of the &quot;Digimon&quot; franchise including anime, manga, toys, video games, trading card games, and other media.

==Creation and development==
Agumon was created by Kenji Watanabe for the Digital Monster virtual pet in 1997 and was created to be a dinosaur that would be able to be taken on a stroll. While creating the &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; short, director Mamoru Hosoda wanted to focus on Tai and Kari&#x27;s relationship with Koromon, the Digimon that appeared in their house. The main theme of the movie was how Tai and Kari had problems interacting with the Digimon as across its multiple forms, he is either silent or talkative. Due to time constraints, Hosoda claimed that the friendship presented was one-dimensional.

Hosoda further elaborated on the bond between Agumon and Tai as they are allies despite being from different ways and expressed a challenge about how it was possible that Tai could help his partner during the battles. As a result, he felt the friendship between Agumon and Tai be deeper based on the latter&#x27;s dilemma. He wants to make Digimon give complete confidence to the humans and thus wanted to give an scenario in for the second OVA to how Tai could help Agumon become stronger and defeat the villain, Diaboromon. That&#x27;s the part I want to let &quot;miracles&quot; take care of. Not to resolve the plot conveniently, but to overcome real issues like this. Taichi and their friends don&#x27;t need to help their partner in the Digital World, but just be by their side. Hosoda wanted people to understand that is the important thing. &quot;On the first glance, it looks like they triggered a &quot;miracle&quot; at that moment, but what they really overcame was that psychological limit&quot;. Through this film, Hosoda wanted to make sure Agumon was not a pet and instead a friend to Tai.

In Japanese, Agumon is voiced by Chika Sakamoto. In English the role is taken by and Tom Fahn (Agumon) MJ Lallo/Philece Sampler/Brianne Siddall did Koromon while Doug Erholtz voiced SkullGreymon. Michael Lindsay/Kyle Hebert voiced Greymon, and Joseph Pilato/Kyle Hebert voiced MetalGreymon, and Lex Lang/Kyle Hebert voiced WarGreymon. In the &quot;Adventure&quot; movie, Peggy O&#x27;Neal voiced Botamon, Michael Sorich Agumon - Adventure Movie, and Bob Papenbrook Greymon.

Taiki Matsuno and Brian Beacock voice the 2006 version of Agumon in &quot;Digimon Data Squad&quot;.

Ben Diskin voice Agumon in the 2020 &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; reboot in the English dub while Sakamoto reprising her role in the Japanese version.

==Appearances==

===Virtual pets===
Agumon debuted in the Digital Monster Ver.1 on June 26, 1997. It has since appeared in most Digimon virtual pet releases, in which Agumon has achieved hundreds of different digivolutions.

===Video games===
Agumon appears in almost every single Digimon video game, though a few of its appearances only feature the 2006 re-design from &quot;Digimon Data Squad&quot; rather than the original 1997 design. Across the video games Agumon has achieved hundreds of different digivolutions.

===Anime===

====&quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; media====
Agumon first appeared in the original video animation (OVA) &quot;Digimon&quot; as a recently born Digimon who befriends the toddlers Tai Kamiya and Kari Kamiya. As it bonds with them, it evolves. When a giant Digimon known as Parrotmon invades the city, the two engage in fight. Agumon is nearly defeated but regains consciousness when Tai plays the whistle. Shortly afterwards, Agumon disappears alongside his enemy.

Agumon later appears in the anime &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; as Tai&#x27;s partner Digimon when the human finds himself lost in the Digital World. He is simple-minded, but he always believes Tai has the best interests for the team and trusts him as a friend. His other forms are (Baby), (In-training), and (Champion). Tai finds an item known as Crest of Courage, he forces Greymon to reach a new evolution form but it becomes berserk and attacks all his allies. When becoming tired, SkullGreymon returns to his Koromon form and Tai requests forgiveness for acting so reckless. Agumon reaches his appropriate Ultimate form, , when Tai unawarely shows bravery to save Sora and defeat Etemon. The fight results in Tai and Koromon finding themselves in the human world where Kari confuses him for the other Koromon from the OVA. Tai and Koromon eventually return to the Digital World to aid their friends. During the battle against the stronger VenomMyotismon, Tai and Agumon are given new powers thanks to Angewomon&#x27;s arrow allowing the Digimon to take the Mega Digimon. . After saving the Digital World from the Dark Masters and Apocalymon, Agumon says Tai farewell as the latter returns to the human world. 

In the OVA &quot;Our War Game&quot;, Agumon travels the web alongside Tentomon, Patamon and Gabumon to defeat Diaboromon, who hacks The Pentagon to launch an LGM-118 Peacekeeper missile at Tokyo. WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon are beaten up by Diaboromon but when Tai and Matt enter the internet and received mails encouraging them to win, the two Mega Digimon combine to become the warrior and kill Diaboromon. 

In &quot;Digimon Adventure 02&quot; Agumon is kidnapped by Ken Ichijoji who forces him to evolve into SkullGreymon and later as his puppet. He is saved by Garurumon and Raildramon as they destroy the item that made Ken control him. 

Agumon also has access to an alternate Mega form called , a Digivolution forged by the bond between Agumon and Tai.

In the 2020 &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; reboot, Agumon is one of six legendary Digimon that fought and destroyed Millenniummon in the ancient past, dying in the process and being reborn. Like in the original series, he is partnered with Tai Kamiya and along with his original digivolutions, he can become MetalGreymon Alterous Mode, a Mode Change of his Ultimate form MetalGreymon that has an arm cannon, a corrupted Mega form in a partially formed and an alternate Mega form called BlitzGreymon caused by an adaptive digivolution. Agumon often acts as the powerhouse of the team, particularly after he digivolves to Mega, becoming the most often appearing Mega Digimon. As WarGreymon, he destroys ZeedMillenniummon once and for all when he&#x27;s resurrected, using a Terra Force powered by the hopes of all of the Digimon that the DigiDestined have met along the way and the power of Goddramon and Holydramon. Agumon has a strong bond with Tai, able to pick his real partner out amongst a number of Algomon replicas when he is put to the test. In the series finale, Agumon gains a digivolution, becoming Omegamon Alter-S to destroy Abbadomon. At the end of the series, rather than returning to the Real World like the other Chosen Ones and their partners, Taichi chooses to stay in the Digital World with Agumon and continue their adventures together.

====&quot;Digimon Data Squad&quot;====
Agumon was re-designed for &quot;Digimon Data Squad&quot;, with this version of Agumon considered a different species under the name . It appears as the partner of Marcus Damon and has a completely different Digivolution line, having access to the forms , , , , , and 

====Other anime====
Agumon cameos in the rest of the Digimon anime, with both Tai&#x27;s Agumon and Marcus&#x27; Agumon appearing in &quot;Digimon Fusion&quot; as part of a cross-over.

===Manga===
Agumon appears in the first ever Digimon Manga &quot;C&#x27;mon Digimon&quot; with a different design than what was used in other media, having been redesigned by Tenya Yabuno. This design was never used again. Agumon also appears in &quot;Digimon Next&quot; as the partner of Tsurugi Tatsuno. It initially appears in its 1997 design, only to mutate into its 2006 design during the course of the story, which causes it to go down the same digivolution line as Marcus Damon&#x27;s Agumon - only with as its Mega form. Tai&#x27;s Agumon&#x27;s appears during a cross-over in the &quot;Digimon Fusion&quot; manga and &quot;Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01&quot;, with Tai&#x27;s Agumon meeting his alternate universe counterparts. Finally, various Agumon cameo in the rest of Digimon&#x27;s manga.

===Manhua===
Tai&#x27;s Agumon appears in the various Manhua made by Yuen Wong Yu.

===Live action===
Agumon appears as the protagonist in the 2020 live action short &quot;Welcome to Digimon World&quot;. It appears as Pulsemon&#x27;s rival in the 2021 live action shorts &quot;Digimon Project 2021&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;UK Anime Network&quot; felt that Agumon was the franchise&#x27; mascot as an answer to Pikachu from &quot;Pokémon&quot; and felt the former was more appealing due to his continuous evolutions fight scenes in the 1990s. IGN Agumon&#x27;s relationship with Tai which made one of the most popular characters from the &#x27;90s. In a poll he was voted as the 5th &quot;Which catcher/trainer would take home the gold?&quot; IGN listed how Tai forces Agumon to evolve into SkullGreymon as one of the best moments from the first &quot;Digimon&quot; anime. Additionally, Tai and Koromon&#x27;s brief return to the real world as listed as another moment due to Tai&#x27;s brief interactions with his younger sister, Kari. DVD Talk saw Agumon as a fanfavorite character, being the cause to why Toei reused another incarnation of the character as a protagonist in &quot;Digimon Data Squad&quot;. The evolution of Omegamon in &quot;Tri&quot; was noted to be an entertaining idea Toei used in the first film of the series but felt the execution was poorly handled. The Fandom Post felt that Agumon&#x27;s inability to console Tai in &quot;Tri&quot; when wondering about the dangers the fights can cause is well written with visuals helping to create a good scene. However, the writer felt that Omegamon&#x27;s fight against Alphamon was anticlimactic as the writing was instead more focused on Tai&#x27;s concerns.

Critics also commented on Agumon&#x27;s role in &quot;Last Evolution Kizuna&quot;. IGN praised how Augmon visited Tai&#x27;s home in the film, giving it a more mature feeling as appealing as fight sequences. HobbyConsolas praised the dilemma presented in the movie as the more Agumon and Gabumon fight, the less time they have to interact with their friends, giving a major emotional impact in the narrative. Anime News Network criticized how the film primarily focused on Agumon and Gabumon&#x27;s relationships with their partners as the rest of the cast do not carry such importance. Inside Pulse felt the emotional value was presented in the film not only due to the fact Agumon will never be with Tai again but also because it has been nearly twenty years since the first series&#x27; premiere and the story concludes the events of the original series&#x27; canon. Joshua Seth and Tom Fahn reflect on what might be their final vocal sessions as Tai and Agumon. Little did either of them know that a job two decades ago would last so long.

For the original series&#x27; reboot, &quot;Polygon&quot; criticized the heavy focus on Agumon and Gabumon&#x27;s evolutions and fights as, sometimes, the rest of the cast members feel too minor. Anime News Network&#x27;s writers were divided about the handling of Agumon in the premiere as while his design remains appealing, his early evolution into Greymon lacks a reason to explain how he has such powers. Christopher Farris from the same site praised how Agumon was supported by Tai to become Greymon and how it later merges with Garurumon to create an enjoyable fight sequence as the warrior Omegamon. Crunchyroll described the reboot&#x27;s Agumon as more likable than the original due to his constant fights he is involved rather than the original childish Agumon. Comic Book Resources claimed fans were divided in regards to the handling of the main cast in the premiere as Greymon and Garurumon combine into Omegamon despite lacking the strength the original canon needed in order to reach this form. When the reboot introduced DoneDevimon as a villain, &quot;Anime News Network&quot; praised MetalGreymon&#x27;s &quot;Dark Evolution&quot; into Mugendramon due to the chaotic scenario presented as the character became enraged when Tai was eaten by the villain. When Mugendramon&#x27;s evolution is reversed as Agumon regains his senses and instead becomes the original Final Form WarGreymon was praised for the visuals and other elements that helped to make the episode one of the best in the series. &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; compared this episode to the original canon to when Agumon became the berserker SkullGreymon but believed the reboot was done in a better fashion. However, he still felt that the evolution as lackluster. Once Agumon becomes WarGreymon again, the same site called it &quot;was the saving grace of this episode&quot; based on how the evolution was handled and claimed that it was important as he considered Agumon the franchise&#x27;s mascot, thus needing an appealing evolution sequence.

Agumon&#x27;s meeting with BlackWarGreymon was praised for starting one of the deepest interactions-related existential crises: while Agumon was born from an egg, BlackWarGreymon is an artificial Digimon, giving rise to the latter&#x27;s inferiority complex and depressive search for meaning in his life. Agumon&#x27;s mental is tested when he is forced to evolve into SkullGreymon as a combination of stress and coward. Crunchyroll agreed, finding this episode showed Tai&#x27;s flaws for the first time in the anime and how it resulted in SkullGreymon&#x27;s evolution and how Agumon&#x27;s evolution into a berserker creature distanced him from the more friendly Pokémon.

<doc id="497570" wikidata="Q932212" url="?curid=497570" title="Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant">
<text>Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant (12 September 1800, Monflanquin – 29 October 1872) was a leading French chess master and an editor of the chess periodical &quot;Le Palamède&quot;. He is best known for losing a match against Howard Staunton in 1843 that is often considered to have been an unofficial match for the World Chess Championship.

==Chess career==
Saint-Amant learned chess from Wilhelm Schlumberger, who later became the operator of The Turk. He played at the Café de la Régence, where he was a student of Alexandre Deschapelles. For many years he played on level terms with Boncourt, a strong player, and received odds of pawn and two moves from Deschapelles and Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais. In 1834–36, he led a Paris team that won both games of a correspondence match against the Westminster Club, then England&#x27;s leading chess club. After La Bourdonnais&#x27; death in 1840, he was considered the country&#x27;s best player. In December 1841 he revived &quot;Le Palamède&quot; (at its inception in 1836 the world&#x27;s first chess periodical), which ran until 1847.
He played two matches against Staunton in 1843. The first, in London, he won 3½–2½ (three wins, one draw, two losses), but he lost a return match in Paris just before Christmas 13–8 (six wins, four draws, eleven losses). This second match is sometimes considered an unofficial world championship match.

In 1858, Saint-Amant played in the Birmingham tournament, a event. He won in the first round, but lost in the second by a 2–1 score to Ernst Falkbeer. Returning to Paris, he witnessed the adulatory reception accorded Paul Morphy at the Café de la Régence. The score of one game between them is known, a 22-move rout by Morphy of Saint-Amant and his consultation partner, given as &quot;F. de L.&quot; or &quot;F. de L&#x27;A&quot;.

==Outside of chess==
Saint-Amant became a government clerk in Paris at an early age. He then served as the secretary to the governor of French Guiana from 1819 to 1821. He was dismissed from that appointment after he protested against the slave trade that still existed in that colony. After that, he tried his hand as a journalist and actor, then became a successful wine merchant. He was a captain in the French National Guard during the 1848 revolution. For his role in saving the Palais des Tuileries from destruction by the mob, he was made its Governor for a few months. In 1851–52, he was the French consul to California. He visited during this period the Territory of Oregon, witnessed a period of transition for the early settlements and wrote one of the few records available on this period. Upon returning to France he spent some years writing well-regarded works on the French colonies, and a treatise on the wines of Bordeaux.

In 1861 Saint-Amant retired to Algeria. He died there in 1872 after being thrown from his carriage.

==Notable games==

Reuben Fine writes that although Saint-Amant lost his epic match against Staunton, in the 13th match game, playing White, &quot;he at least had the satisfaction of winning the most brilliant game.&quot;

<doc id="497575" wikidata="Q461026" url="?curid=497575" title="The Red-Headed League">
<text>&quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It first appeared in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in August 1891, with illustrations by Sidney Paget. Conan Doyle ranked &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; second in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories. It is also the second of the twelve stories in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in 1892.

== Plot==

Jabez Wilson, a London pawnbroker, comes to consult Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. While studying this prospective client, both Holmes and Watson notice his red hair. 

Wilson tells them that some weeks before, his young assistant Vincent Spaulding urged him to respond to a newspaper advertisement by &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; offering highly-paid work to only red-headed male applicants. The next morning, Wilson was hired to copy out the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;, for which he was paid £4 per week (). The work was useless clerical labour, performed in nominal compliance with the will of an eccentric American millionaire who wanted to provide for the welfare of red-headed men like himself. After eight weeks, Wilson reported to the office, only to find a note on the door stating that the Red-Headed League had been dissolved. He spoke with the landlord, who stated that he had never heard of the organisation.

Wilson provides a description of Spaulding, after which Holmes and Watson visit the pawnshop. Concluding that a crime is about to be committed at a bank near the shop, Holmes gathers Watson, Inspector Jones of Scotland Yard, and bank chairman Mr. Merryweather that night.

As the four hide in the darkened bank vault, Merryweather reveals that it holds a shipment of gold coins borrowed from a French bank; Holmes suspects a wanted criminal named John Clay of planning to steal them. After more than an hour&#x27;s wait, Clay and his red-headed accomplice Archie break upward through the vault floor and both are caught by waiting police. 

Back at Baker Street, Holmes explains his reasoning to Watson. Archie and Spaulding, whom Holmes had recognised as Clay from Wilson&#x27;s description, concocted the Red-Headed League as a way to keep Wilson occupied during the day, so that Clay could tunnel into the bank vault from the cellar of the shop.

== Analysis ==
The dates given in the story do not match the characters&#x27; descriptions of time passing. The date that Wilson sees the advertisement is 27 April 1890 and he has been at work for 8 weeks and says &quot;Just two months ago.&quot; Thus that happened by the end of June. However, the story begins by describing Holmes&#x27;s meeting with Wilson as being on &quot;one day in the autumn of last year&quot; and the date on the door telling of the League being dissolved is that of 9 October 1890, six months after the ad was placed.

Dorothy L. Sayers analyzed this discrepancy and claims that the dates must have been 4 August and 4 October respectively.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in August 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in September 1891. The story was published with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in October 1892.

==Baker Street robbery==

The story inspired the real-life 1971 Baker Street robbery in which a criminal gang tunneled from a rented shop into a bank vault. That robbery was then adapted into the 2008 film &quot;The Bank Job&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
A 1921 short film was adapted from the story as part of the Stoll film series featuring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes.

The story was adapted for a 1951 TV episode of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes.

The first American television adaptation of the story was in the 1954–1955 television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Ronald Howard.

An adaptation of &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; was used for an episode of the 1965 television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson, with Toke Townley as Jabez Wilson.

In the 1985 television adaptation starring Jeremy Brett, the scheme was masterminded by Professor Moriarty and Clay is Moriarty&#x27;s star pupil of crime (Holmes and Jones explicitly note that Clay is usually more of an impulsive criminal who wouldn&#x27;t come up with something this elaborate on his own).

An episode of the animated 1999–2001 television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; titled &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; was based on the story.

In the NHK puppetry television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Jabez Wilson is a pupil of Beeton School as well as Holmes and Watson and is invited to the Red-Headed Club by his senior Duncan Ross. But strangely enough, what he does in the club is painting balls, stones and bottles red. Holmes suspects that it is a means for Ross to ensure Wilson stays away from a certain place.

===Radio and audio dramas===
Edith Meiser adapted the story as the third episode of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which aired on 5 January 1931, starring Clive Brook as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other episodes adapted from the story aired on 24 May 1933 (with Richard Gordon as Holmes and Lovell as Watson) and 8 February 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Edith Meiser also adapted the story for the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 27 October 1940. Other episodes adapted from the story aired on 28 May 1943, and on 2 June 1947 (with Tom Conway as Holmes and Bruce as Watson). The story was also read by Basil Rathbone in a 1966 recording released by Caedmon Records.

A radio adaptation starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson aired on the BBC Home Service in 1953, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series. Hobbs and Shelley also played Holmes and Watson respectively in a 1957 radio adaptation on the BBC Home Service, and a 1964 radio adaptation on the BBC Light Programme.

John Gielgud played Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in a radio adaptation of &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; which aired on 19 October 1954 on the BBC Light Programme. The production also aired in January 1955 on NBC radio and in May 1956 on ABC radio.

A radio adaptation aired on 26 April 1977, on the series &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;. Kevin McCarthy was the voice of Holmes.

An adaptation aired on BBC radio in June 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell.

&quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1990 by Vincent McInerney as an episode of the 1989–1998 radio series, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It also featured James Wilby as Vincent Spaulding.

A 2014 episode of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; was adapted from the story, and starred John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a three-episodes adventure called &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Stage===
The story, along with &quot;The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, and &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot;, provided the source material for the play &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

===Video games===
Multiple references to the story are made in the two &quot;The Great Ace Attorney&quot; games. In the first game, &quot;The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures&quot;, Herlock Sholmes (who is Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes in the original Japanese version, with his name changed for legal reasons as part of localization) incorrectly deduces that one of the involved parties in the final case was trying to dig a tunnel into a bank from a pawnshop, which is quickly disproven by protagonist Ryunosuke Naruhodo. In the second game, &quot;The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve&quot;, Sholmes is fooled by a fraudulent advertisement from the &quot;Red-Headed League&quot; and drinks a potion that turns his hair red before being scammed out of five shillings. Sholmes later has the two leaders of the &quot;league&quot; arrested, and their testimony about the scam proves important in revealing the truth of the international conspiracy at the heart of the game&#x27;s plot. In addition, the name John Clay is briefly mentioned in another case, though as the name of a policeman rather than a criminal, and a character is named Duncan Ross, although he is seemingly unrelated to the Red-Headed League.

===Books===
It was adapted into one of the books of the Hong Kong children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Great Detective Sherlock Holmes&quot;, as &quot;The Great Robbery&quot; (驚天大劫案). It is Book #8 of the original Chinese version, and book #9 of the English version.

<text>Bernhard Horwitz (1807 in Neustrelitz – 1885 in London) was a German and British chess master, chess writer and chess composer.

Horwitz was born in Neustrelitz and went to school in Berlin, where he studied art. From 1837 to 1843, he was part of a group of German chess players known as &quot;The Pleiades&quot;.

He moved to London in 1845, where he became a British citizen. In 1846, he lost a match against visiting master Lionel Kieseritzky, and another against Howard Staunton, losing 15.5–8.5. His best chess result was winning a match against Henry Bird in 1851. He played in the first international chess tournament, London 1851, again beating Bird in the first round, but losing to Staunton in the second and József Szén in the third.

Horwitz&#x27;s &quot;Chess Studies&quot; (1851), co-authored with Josef Kling, is an important work on the endgame study and endgames in general.

&quot;Horwitz bishops&quot;, a configuration in which two bishops are aggressively placed on adjacent diagonals, are named after Horwitz.

The Kling and Horwitz Defensive Technique enables Black to force a draw with Black to move against perfect play in the diagram shown to the right. For a detailed analysis of this position, see here.Horwitz died in 1885 and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="497585" wikidata="Q731385" url="?curid=497585" title="STS-41-D">
<text>STS-41-D (formerly STS-14) was the 12th flight of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, and the first mission of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. It was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1984, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1984. Three commercial communications satellites were deployed into orbit during the six-day mission, and a number of scientific experiments were conducted, including a prototype extendable solar array that would eventually form the basis of the main solar arrays on the International Space Station (ISS).

The mission was delayed by more than two months from its original planned launch date, having experienced the Space Shuttle program&#x27;s first launch abort at T−4 seconds on June 26, 1984.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission background ==
The launch was originally planned for June 25, 1984, but because of a variety of technical problems, including rollback to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to replace a faulty Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), the launch was delayed by over two months. The June 26, 1984, launch attempt marked the first time since Gemini 6A that a crewed spacecraft had experienced a shutdown of its engines just prior to launch.

=== June 1984 launch attempt ===
During the June 26, 1984, launch attempt, there was a launch abort at T−4 seconds, followed by a pad fire about ten minutes later. Because the center engine had not started when the abort was triggered, confusion ensued as the flight controllers were unable to verify its state:
Commentary: &quot;We have a cut off&quot;.
&quot;NTD [&quot;NASA Test Director&quot;] we have a RSLS [&quot;Redundant Set Launch Sequencer&quot;] abort&quot;.

Commentary: &quot;We have an abort by the onboard computers of the orbiter Discovery&quot;.
&quot;Break break, break break, GLS [&quot;Ground Launch Sequencer&quot;] shows engine one not shut down&quot;.
&quot;OK, PLT [&quot;pilot&quot;]?&quot;
&quot;CSME [&quot;Space Shuttle Main Engines&quot;] verify engine one&quot;.
&quot;You want me to shut down engine one?&quot;
&quot;We do not show engine start on one&quot;.
&quot;OTC [&quot;Orbiter test conductor&quot;] I can verify shutdown on verify on engine one, we haven&#x27;t start prepped engine one&quot;.
&quot;All engines shut down I can verify that&quot;.

Commentary: &quot;We can now verify all three engines have been shut down&quot;.
&quot;We have red lights on engines two and three in the cockpit, not on one&quot;.
&quot;All right, CSME verify engine one safe for APU [&quot;auxiliary power unit&quot;] shutdown&quot;.
&quot;If I can verify that?&quot;
&quot;OTC GPC [&quot;General Purpose Computer&quot;] go for APU shutdown&quot;.
Mission Specialist Steve Hawley was reported as saying following the abort: &quot;Gee, I thought we&#x27;d be a lot higher at MECO (Main Engine Cut-Off)!&quot;. About ten minutes later, the following was heard on live TV coverage:
&quot;We have indication two of our fire detectors on the zero level; no response. They&#x27;re side by side right next to the engine area. The engineer requested that we turn on the heat shield fire water which is what could be seen spraying up in the vicinity of the engine bells of &quot;Discovery&quot;″s three main engines&quot;.
While evacuating the shuttle 20 minutes later, the crew was doused with water from the pad deluge system, which was activated due to a hydrogen fire on the launch pad caused by the free hydrogen (fuel) that had collected around the engine nozzles following the shutdown and engine anomaly. Because the fire was invisible to humans, had the astronauts used the normal emergency escape procedure across the service arm to the slidewire escape baskets, they would have run into the fire.

Changes to procedures resulting from the abort included more practicing of &quot;safing&quot; the orbiter following aborts at various points, the use of the fire suppression system in all pad aborts, and the testing of the slidewire escape system with a real person (Charles F. Bolden Jr.). It emerged that launch controllers were reluctant to order the crew to evacuate during the STS-41-D abort, as the slidewire had not been ridden by a human.

Examination of telemetry data indicated that the engine malfunction had been caused by a stuck valve that prevented proper flow of LOX into the combustion chamber.

== Mission summary ==
STS-41-D launched on 08:41:50 a.m. EDT on August 30, 1984, after a six-minute, fifty-second delay when a private aircraft flew into the restricted airspace near the launch pad. It was the fourth launch attempt for &quot;Discovery&quot;. Because of the two-month delay, the STS-41-F mission was canceled (STS-41-E had already been canceled), and its primary payloads were included on the STS-41-D flight. The combined cargo weighed over , a record for a Space Shuttle payload up to that time.

The six-person flight crew consisted of Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., commander, making his second shuttle mission; pilot Michael L. Coats; three mission specialists – Judith A. Resnik, Richard M. Mullane and Steven A. Hawley; and a payload specialist, Charles D. Walker, an employee of McDonnell Douglas. Walker was the first commercially sponsored payload specialist to fly aboard the Space Shuttle. Resnik became the second American woman to fly any NASA space mission, after Sally K. Ride.

Primary cargo of &quot;Discovery&quot; consisted of three commercial communications satellites: SBS-4 for Satellite Business Systems, Telstar 302 for Telesat of Canada, and Syncom IV-2, or Leasat-2, a Hughes-built satellite leased to the U.S. Navy; all three were Hughes-built satellites. Leasat-2 was the first large communications satellite designed specifically to be deployed from the Space Shuttle. All three satellites were deployed successfully and became operational.

Another payload was the OAST-1 solar array, a device wide and high, which folded into a package deep. The array carried a number of different types of experimental solar cells and was extended to its full height several times during the mission. At the time, it was the largest structure ever extended from a crewed spacecraft, and it demonstrated the feasibility of large lightweight solar arrays for use on future orbital installations, such as the International Space Station (ISS).

The McDonnell Douglas-sponsored Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) experiment, using living cells, was more elaborate than the one flown on previous missions, and payload specialist Walker operated it for more than 100 hours during the flight. A student experiment to study crystal growth in microgravity was also carried out. The highlights of the mission were filmed using an IMAX motion picture camera, and later appeared in the 1985 documentary film &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot;. On September 3, 1984, concern arose over the formation of ice on the waste dump nozzle of the shuttle. The cause was an obstruction in the shuttle&#x27;s external wastewater dumping system that caused a &quot;pee-sicle&quot; to form during the mission; Hartsfield removed it with the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) the following day.

The mission lasted 6 days, 0 hour, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds, with landing taking place on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base at 06:37:54 a.m. PDT on September 5, 1984. During STS-41-D, &quot;Discovery&quot; traveled a total of and made 97 orbits. The orbiter was transported back to KSC on September 10, 1984. Ominously, STS-41-D was the first Shuttle mission in which blow-by damage to the SRB O-rings was discovered, with a small amount of soot found beyond the primary O-ring. Following the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, Morton Thiokol engineer Brian Russell called this finding the first &quot;big red flag&quot; on SRB Joint and O-ring safety.

A representation of &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; namesake is manifested in a sailing ship, which is linked to the Shuttle (with the OAST solar array in the payload bay) via a red, white, and blue path, signifying its maiden voyage.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>The University of New Haven (UNH) is a private university in West Haven, Connecticut, United States. 

==History==
The University of New Haven was founded in 1920 as the New Haven YMCA Junior College, a division of Northeastern University, which shared buildings, laboratories, and faculty members on the campus of Yale University, for nearly 40 years.

==Academics==

The University of New Haven has nearly 100 undergraduate programs and 50 graduate programs. 

The university is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education, a successor of the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, and has been since 1948. 

In 2015, the University of New Haven&#x27;s College of Business received accreditation from AACSB International, and in 2020 that accreditation was renewed through the 2024-2025 academic year. 

== Rankings and reputation ==
In 2024, the university was ranked No. 87 among &quot;Regional Universities North&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Campus==
The University of New Haven currently houses 48 campus buildings, including the Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science – and the newest building, the Bergami Center for Science, Technology, and Innovation. This includes 14 on- and off-campus, university-sponsored residence halls.

===Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science===

The Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science opened on the campus of the University of New Haven in the fall of 1998. The institute was dedicated on October 15, 2010, and consists of a crime scene center, crisis management center, museum, laboratories, classrooms, and a 104-seat lecture hall.
==Athletics==
The New Haven Chargers, the university&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams, compete in NCAA Division II. The Chargers&#x27; 20 athletics teams, 8 for men and 12 for women, compete as members of the Northeast-10 Conference. New Haven has been a member of the NE-10 since 2008.

In 2022-23, athletic highlights included 140 combined wins across the 20 varsity sports, 37 All-Conference honorees, 18 All-Region athletes, four major conference awards, three All-Americans, seven Academic All-Conference honorees, two Sport Excellence winners, and more than 320 student-athletes named to the NE10 Academic Honor Roll following the fall semester. 

==Student organizations==
The University of New Haven had 199 clubs and organizations as of September 2023.

===Greek life===
There are several recognized and unrecognized fraternities and sororities at the university.

===Student government===
The University of New Haven has two student-run governing bodies: the Undergraduate Student Government Association (USGA), and the Graduate Student Council (GSC). Student organizations offices are located on the top floor of Bartels Hall, the university&#x27;s student center.

===Student newspaper===
The &quot;Charger Bulletin&quot; is the official, student-run newspaper at the University of New Haven since 1938. It is published weekly in a quarter-folded tabloid format. Both undergraduate and graduate students write for the paper. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; comes out weekly on Wednesdays while classes are in session. The paper version of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; is distributed for free throughout the campus of UNH, and is also published online.

===Marching band===
The University of New Haven Chargers Marching Band (UNHMB) has around 300 members.

===Radio station===

The university&#x27;s noncommercial radio station, WNHU-FM, first signed onto the air at 16:00 EDT on July 4, 1973. The WNHU studios moved to its current home on Ruden Street into the Lois Evalyn Bergami Broadcast Media Center in 2015. Its location on Ruden Street includes a production space for live and recorded programming, a server room, staff offices, and a student lounge. WNHU is managed by a 10-person student leadership team. Positions include station manager, promotions director, Aircheck director, WNHU program director, director of fundraising, program/music director, and productions director. The University of New Haven&#x27;s communications department started to work with the radio station for students to have access to the station. The station operates as a laboratory for student learning, and as a source of culturally diverse programming for the communities served. 
WNHU is broadcast on 88.7 FM; it is considered the best college radio station in Connecticut according to the &quot;New Haven Advocate&quot;, which has awarded the station &quot;Best College Radio Station&quot; for over six consecutive years.

WNHU is known for eclectic programming, with shows ranging from new music, rock, gospel, funk, and talk shows to specialty formats such as polka and Irish music. Unlike many college or community radio stations where DJs change frequently, some WNHU personalities have hosted shows for years, many of whom are UNH alumni.

=== Bucknall Theater ===
Bucknall Theater was named in honor of William L. Bucknall, Jr. The theater has about two productions a semester as well as holding several functions for the university throughout the academic year. The space also doubles as a learning space for many of the classes pertaining to the Arts Department, more specifically theatre minors.

<text>STS-51-A (formerly STS-19) was the 14th flight of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, and the second flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center on November 8, 1984, and landed just under eight days later on November 16, 1984.

STS-51-A marked the first time a shuttle deployed two communications satellites, and retrieved from orbit two other communications satellites. The Canadian Anik D2 and Syncom IV-1 satellites were both successfully deployed by the crew of &quot;Discovery&quot;. Palapa B2 and Westar 6, meanwhile, had been deployed during the STS-41-B mission earlier in the year, but had been placed into improper orbits due to the malfunctioning of their kick motors; they were both safely recovered and returned to Earth during STS-51-A.

STS-51-A was launched from Florida&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) at 7:15:00 a.m. EST, on November 8, 1984, less than a month after the STS-41-G flight. A launch attempt the day before was scrubbed at T-minus 20 minutes due to high shear winds in the upper atmosphere.

The five-person flight crew consisted of Frederick H. Hauck, commander, on his second flight; pilot David M. Walker; and three mission specialists – Anna Lee Fisher, Dale A. Gardner and Joseph P. Allen. Both Gardner and Allen were making their second shuttle flights. STS-51-A marked the first flight of the Space Shuttle commanded by an astronaut from the 1978 class rather than the Apollo era.

The two communications satellites successfully deployed were Anik D2 (on the second day of the mission) and Syncom IV-1, also known as Leasat 1 (on the third day); both were Hughes-built satellites. The orbiter then began a series of maneuvers to meet up with the first of the two satellites to be recovered, Palapa B2. The orbits of both satellites had been lowered by ground commands from about to to facilitate recovery operations. On day five of the mission, &quot;Discovery&quot; rendezvoused with Palapa. Mission specialists Allen and Gardner performed an EVA, capturing the satellite with a device known as a &quot;Stinger&quot; (Apogee Capture Device (ACD)), which was inserted into the satellite&#x27;s apogee motor nozzle by Allen. The satellite&#x27;s rotation was slowed to 1 RPM, and Gardner, operating from a position on the end of the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) (Canadarm), attempted unsuccessfully to grapple the satellite. Allen was able to manually maneuver the satellite into its cradle with Gardner&#x27;s help, further aided by the Canadarm, which was operated by Fisher. The successful, improvised rescue effort took two hours.

The recovery of Westar 6 was not as difficult, and took place a day later. This time, Gardner, using the same muscle-power technique Allen had used for Palapa B2&#x27;s rescue, easily captured the satellite. With Allen&#x27;s help, he placed it in a cradle in the cargo bay. Following Westar 6&#x27;s recovery, Gardner humorously held up a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign, as if trying to find someone to sell the malfunctioning satellites to, as a means to indicate the successful recovery and as a means to provide some comical relief for the troubled owners. The Westar satellite was, ironically enough, indeed later sold to Hong Kong–based AsiaSat.

The STS-51-A mission also carried the Diffused Mixing of Organic Solutions (DMOS) experiment. It was the first of a series of comprehensive organic and polymer science experiments sponsored by
3M. This mid-deck experiment was successful, and the proprietary results of the chemical mixes were turned over to 3M. One other experiment, a radiation monitoring experiment, was also performed.

The satellite recoveries on STS-51-A were the last untethered spacewalks until 1994, and marked the last use of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU). In 1994, the
Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) was tested on STS-64. On all subsequent spacewalks conducted by both NASA and the Soviet/Russian space agencies, the astronauts were tethered to the craft by some means.

The second mission of &quot;Discovery&quot; ended at 6:59:56 a.m. EST on November 16, 1984, with a successful landing on Runway 15 at KSC. Footage of the landing was used in opening scene of the 1985 IMAX movie &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot;. The flight completed 127 orbits, and lasted 7 days, 23 hours, 44 minutes, and 56 seconds. It was the third shuttle landing at KSC, and the fifth and last shuttle mission of 1984.

== Mission insignia ==
STS-51-A Mission insignia depicts the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; en route to Earth orbit for NASA&#x27;s STS-51-A mission and is reminiscent of a soaring eagle, shown in the insignia. The red and white trailing stripes, the blue background, and the presence of the Eagle, generate memories of America&#x27;s 208 year-old history and traditions. The two satellites orbiting the Earth backgrounded amidst a celestial scene are a universal representation of the versatility of the Space Shuttle. The two satellites it is meant to retrieve are also included as a more specific reference to the mission&#x27;s main objective and a highlight of what part of the Shuttle&#x27;s versatile mission capabilities she would be covering this time. White lettering against the blue border lists the surnames of the five-member crew.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-51-C (formerly STS-10) was the 15th flight of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, and the third flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. It launched on January 24, 1985, and made the fourth shuttle landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on January 27, 1985. STS-51-C was the first shuttle mission dedicated to the United States Department of Defense (DoD), and consequently many details remain classified. NASA reported that a satellite (USA-8) was deployed during the mission using an Inertial Upper Stage booster was deployed and met mission objectives. At just over three days, the mission was shorter in duration than most civilian missions and was the shortest of &quot;Discovery&quot;″s career.

== Mission summary ==
STS-51-C launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on January 24, 1985, at 19:50:00 UTC, and was the first of nine shuttle missions in 1985. It was originally scheduled for January 23, 1985, but was delayed because of freezing weather. &quot;Challenger&quot; had been scheduled for this flight, but &quot;Discovery&quot; was substituted when problems were encountered with &quot;Challenger&#x27;s&quot; thermal protection tiles. STS-51-C marked the 100th human spaceflight to achieve orbit.

The mission&#x27;s length of three days was shorter than the week or longer of most civilian shuttle flights. It was the first dedicated to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and most information about it remains classified. For the first time, NASA did not provide pre-launch commentary to the public until nine minutes before liftoff. The U.S. Air Force only stated that the shuttle successfully launched its payload with an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) on the mission&#x27;s seventh orbit. It is believed that the payload was a Magnum SIGINT satellite into geosynchronous orbit. Other DoD flights STS-33 and STS-38 could have carried similar payloads. Payton stated in 2009 that STS-51-C&#x27;s payload is &quot;still up there, and still operating&quot;. Payton was a USAF Manned Spaceflight Engineer (MSE); the USAF declined a NASA offer to fly another MSE on the mission.

Also, according to &quot;Aviation Week&quot;, the shuttle initially entered a orbit, at an inclination of 28.45° to the equator. It then executed three Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) burns, the last being executed on the fourth orbit. The first burn was conducted to circularize the shuttle&#x27;s orbit at .

The mission lasted 3 days, 1 hour, 33 minutes, and 23 seconds. &quot;Discovery&quot; touched down on SLF Runway 15 at KSC on January 27, 1985, at 21:23:23 UTC. IMAX footage of the STS-51-C launch was used in the 1985 movie &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot;.

== Mission insignia == 
The crew insignia for STS Flight 51-C includes the names of its five crewmembers. The STS 51-C mission marked the third trip of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; into space, which is referenced by the three colored trailing strips behind the orbiter in the United States red, white and blue. It was the first Space Shuttle mission totally dedicated to the U.S. Department of Defense, hence the DoD central eagle on the mission patch. The five stars on the upper part of the golden band of the DoD insignia represent the five astronauts. As this mission was classified, the patch includes no further detail as to the mission&#x27;s payload or nature. For similar reasons, the name of the used orbiter was omitted from the patch.

== Connection to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster ==
Almost exactly a year after STS-51-C, Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; was destroyed with all hands on board during the STS-51-L mission including Ellison Onizuka, a crew member on both flights. As part of the investigation into the disaster, it was reported to the Rogers Commission that during the launch of STS-51-C, the worst Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) blow-by effects of any mission prior to STS-51-L occurred, indicating conclusively that the Viton O-rings were not sufficiently sealing the hot gases inside the combustion chambers of the SRBs while firing. After they were recovered post-flight, the O-rings in both the right and left SRBs showed some degree of charring, but analysis of the center field joint of the right SRB showed an unprecedented penetration of the primary O-ring and heavy charring on the secondary O-ring.

This information is significant to the established consensus that low air temperature was a major factor in &quot;Challenger&quot;″s destruction because the temperature at STS-51-C&#x27;s launch was also, up to its time, the coldest recorded during a shuttle launch, at only .

<doc id="497595" wikidata="Q441174" url="?curid=497595" title="George Atwood">
<text>George Atwood ( – 11 July 1807) was an English mathematician who invented the Atwood machine for illustrating the effects of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. He was also a renowned chess player whose skill for recording many games of his own and of other players, including François-André Danican Philidor, the leading master of his time, left a valuable historical record for future generations.

Atwood was born in Westminster, with the date remaining unknown, but presumed to have been shortly before his baptism on 15 October 1745. He attended Westminster School, and in 1765, was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1769, with the rank of third wrangler and was awarded the inaugural first Smith&#x27;s Prize. Subsequently, he became a fellow and a tutor of the college. In 1776, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.

In 1784, he left Cambridge and soon afterwards received from William Pitt the Younger the office of patent searcher of the customs, which required but little attendance, enabling him to devote a considerable portion of his time to mathematics and physics.

Atwood died unmarried in Westminster at the age of 61, and was buried there at St. Margaret&#x27;s Church. Over a century later, a lunar crater was renamed Atwood in his honour.

==Selected publications==
Atwood&#x27;s published works, exclusive of papers contributed to the Philosophical Transactions, for one of which he obtained the 1796 Copley Medal, are as follows:
* &quot;Analysis of a Course of Lectures on the Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot; (Cambridge, 1784).
* &quot;Treatise on the Rectilinear Motion and Rotation of Bodies&quot; (Cambridge, 1784), which gives some interesting experiments, by means of which mechanical truths can be ocularly exhibited and demonstrated, and describes the machine, since named after Atwood, for verifying experimentally the laws of simple acceleration of motion.
* &quot;The construction and analysis of geometrical propositions, determining the positions assumed by homogeneal bodies which float freely and at rest on a fluid surface&quot;, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (London, 1796); (portuguese translation, 1798).
* &quot;Review of the Statutes and Ordinances of Assize which have been established in England from the 4th year of King John, 1202, to the 37th of his present Majesty&quot; (London, 1801), a work of some historical research.
* &quot;Dissertation on the Construction and Properties of Arches&quot; (London, 1801).
* Chess games recorded by Atwood were published posthumously by George Walker in London in 1835, under the name &quot;Selection of Games at Chess, actually played by Philidor and his Contemporaries&quot;. Atwood was one of a few masters that could beat Verdoni on occasion.

<text>STS-51-D was the 16th flight of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, and the fourth flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. The launch of STS-51-D from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on April 12, 1985, was delayed by 55 minutes, after a boat strayed into the restricted Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) recovery zone. STS-51-D was the third shuttle mission to be extended.

On April 19, 1985, after a week-long flight, &quot;Discovery&quot; conducted the fifth shuttle landing at KSC. The shuttle suffered extensive brake damage and a ruptured tire during landing. This forced shuttle landings to be done at Edwards Air Force Base, California for the next five years until the development and implementation of nose wheel steering made landings at KSC more feasible.

== Mission summary ==
During STS-51-D, the shuttle crew deployed two communications satellites: Telesat-I (Anik C1) and Syncom IV-3 (also known as Leasat-3); both were Hughes-built satellites. Telesat-I was attached to a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D) motor and successfully deployed. Syncom IV-3, however, failed to initiate antenna deployment and spin-up, or ignite its perigee kick motor upon deployment. The mission was consequently extended by two days to ensure that the satellite&#x27;s spacecraft sequencer start lever was in its proper position. Griggs and Hoffman performed an unscheduled Extravehicular Activity (EVA) to attach homemade &quot;Flyswatter&quot; devices to the shuttle&#x27;s Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm). Seddon then engaged the satellite&#x27;s start lever using the RMS, but again the post-deployment sequence did not begin. The satellite was subsequently retrieved, repaired and successfully redeployed during the STS-51-I mission later that year.

&quot;Discovery&quot;″s other mission payloads included the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System III (CFES-III), which was flying for sixth time; two Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) experiments; the American Flight Echo-cardiograph (AFE); two Getaway specials (GASs); a set of Phase Partitioning Experiments (PPE); an astronomical photography verification test; various medical experiments; and &quot;Toys in Space&quot;, an informal study of the behavior of simple toys in a microgravity environment, with the results being made available to school students upon the shuttle&#x27;s return.

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed on Runway 33 of the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center at 13:54:28UTC (8:54:28amEST local time at the landing site). As the orbiter approached the runway, it was buffeted by a crosswind from the right, which pushed the orbiter left of the runway&#x27;s center line as the rear landing gear touched down. As the orbiter rolled out, the crosswind continued to push it towards the left, causing it to drift from the center line of the runway. At this point, Commander Bobko began to counteract the drift by applying more pressure to the right-wheel brakes, a technique called differential steering, which brought the orbiter back to the center of the runway. However, he had to apply twice as much force to the right brakes and about before stopping the brakes on the right-side inboard tire locked up and before stopping the brakes on the right-side outboard tire locked up and the inboard tire blew. The incident prompted NASA to add nose wheel steering to the orbiters, which was complete by late 1985. Until that work was completed, NASA would land the orbiters at the Edwards Air Force Base which offered the option of landing on a long and wide dry lake bed from more directions. Nose wheel steering was also implemented shortly before the Challenger disaster, which would ground the shuttle program for a time. Ultimately, it would be five years until a mission would again land at the SLF, when STS-38 had to divert there due to bad weather at Edwards.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="497598" wikidata="Q333726" url="?curid=497598" title="Marmaduke Wyvill (chess player)">
<text>Marmaduke Wyvill (22 December 1815 in Constable Burton – 25 June 1896 in Bournemouth) was a leading English chess master and Liberal Party politician. He was among the world&#x27;s strongest players in the 1840s and 1850s.

He was born the son of Marmaduke Wyvill of Constable Burton Hall (1791–1872), MP for York.

He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1840.

Regarded by Howard Staunton as &#x27;one of the finest players in England&#x27;, he was primarily an enthusiastic amateur of chess, yet in his sole tournament appearance at London 1851 he took second prize behind Adolf Anderssen. Finishing ahead of Staunton, Elijah Williams, Bernhard Horwitz, and Jozsef Szen, he succumbed only to Anderssen in the final, by a score of 2½-4½. Long after he had retired from competitive play, he retained a great interest in the game and was known to have contributed to the organisation and funding of the 1883 London tournament.

Through his 1845 marriage to Laura, daughter of Sir Charles Ibbetson, Bart., he came into possession of Denton Hall. In 1847 Wyvill was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond, North Yorkshire. He retained the seat in 1861, but lost it in 1865, regaining it for a final time in 1866.

In a chess game, the Wyvill formation refers to a pawn formation in which White has no pawn on the &quot;b&quot; file, doubled pawns at c3 and c4, and the d-pawn at d4 or d5, such as may typically arise out of variations of the Nimzo-Indian and (Winawer) French Defences. The pawn at c4 may become a weakness, since it cannot be supported by other pawns.

==Notable game==

His triumph in the third game of the final of the London tournament saw Wyvill winning with a fine counter-attack after defending Anderssen&#x27;s attack with great expertise. As Staunton put it in a note to Black&#x27;s 28th move: &quot;... the assault is conducted with uncommon ingenuity and spirit.&quot;

<text>The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a global environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, United States. it works via affiliates or branches in 79 countries and territories, as well as across every state in the US.

Founded in 1951, The Nature Conservancy has over one million members globally and has protected more than of land in its history. it is the largest environmental non-profit organization by assets and revenue in the Americas.

==History==
The Nature Conservancy developed out of a scholarly organization initially known as the Ecological Society of America (ESA). The ESA was founded in 1915, and later formed a Committee on Preservation of Natural Areas for Ecological Study, headed by Victor Shelford.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.nature.org/about-us&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The primary aim of Shelford was to find areas of land that would be beneficial for long-term research. By the 1930s, Shelford and his colleagues such as Aldo Leopold increasingly sought to advocate for conservation. The divide in viewpoints regarding scholarship or advocacy led the Society to dissolve the committee and in 1946, Shelford and his colleagues formed the Ecologists&#x27; Union. The latter group eventually took the name &quot;The Nature Conservancy&quot;, in emulation of the British agency of that name, which pursued a mission of conserving open space and wildlife preserves. The Nature Conservancy was incorporated in the United States as a non-profit organization on October 22, 1951.

As the organization grew, the organization focused largely on buying as much land as possible in the name of conservation with little scientific research conducted on land before being purchased. Patrick Noonan served as president from 1973 to 1980 and spearheaded major land acquisitions, fundraising and decentralized growth of state programs. In 1970 the organization hired its first staff scientist, Robert E. Jenkins Jr., who helped the organization refocus its mission to conserving natural diversity. With Noonan&#x27;s support, in 1974 Jenkins began to partner with state governments to develop state-by-state inventories which assembled and stored data on the &quot;elements&quot; of nature (e.g. rare species and natural communities) and on &quot;element occurrences&quot; (the specific locations where they occur), which later morphed into the Natural Heritage Network, a network of state natural heritage programs.

==Project sites==


The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s efforts include conservation in North America, Central America, and South America, Africa, the Pacific Rim, the Caribbean, and Asia.

=== North America: selected projects ===
The Nature Conservancy and its conservation partner, Pronatura Peninsula Yucatán, to halt deforestation on private lands in and around the 1.8 million acre (7,300 km2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, along the Guatemala–Mexico border. They brokered the protection of 370,000 acres (1,500 km2) of tropical forest in Calakmul. In another program, TNC is working to protect wildlife habitat in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

In 2007, the Nature Conservancy made a purchase of New York forestland from Finch Paper Holdings LLC for $110 million, its largest purchase ever in that state.
In June 2008, The Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land announced they reached an agreement to purchase approximately of western Montana forestland from Plum Creek Timber Company for $510 million. The purchase, known as the Montana Legacy Project, is part of an effort to keep these forests in productive timber management and protect the area&#x27;s clean water and abundant fish and wildlife habitat, while promoting continued public access to these lands for fishing, hiking, hunting and other recreational pursuits. As a follow-on, in 2015 The Nature Conservancy made a $134 million transaction to purchase – of forests, rivers and wildlife habitat in the Cascade Mountain Range of Washington and in the Blackfoot River Valley in Montana.
The Conservancy also acquired this land from Plum Creek, including in the Yakima River Headwaters in Washington and in the Lower Blackfoot River Watershed in Montana.

Nature United is the Canadian affiliate of The Nature Conservancy. Nature United was founded as a Canadian charity in 2014, building on decades of conservation in Canada. Headquartered in Toronto, the organization has field staff located across the country. Nature United supports Indigenous leadership, sustainable economic development, and large-scale conservation, primarily in the Great Bear Rainforest, Clayoquot Sound, the Northwest Territories, and northern Manitoba.

=== Africa ===
In December 2015, The Nature Conservancy announced the finalization of the first ever debt swap in Seychelles aimed at ocean conservation. The new protected area increases the country&#x27;s marine protected waters from less than 1 percent to more than 30 percent including support for the creation of the second largest Marine Protected Area in the Western Indian Ocean. The debt swap deal was made possible through a partnership with the Seychelles Ministry of Finance, support of debt-holding nations including France, and grants from private organizations led by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.

Financing for this effort was organized by The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s impact investing unit called NatureVest. NatureVest was created in 2014 with founding sponsorship from JPMorgan Chase with the stated goal of sourcing and putting to work at least $1 billion of impact investment capital for measurable conservation outcomes over three years. For their work on the Seychelles debt restructuring, The Nature Conservancy and JPMorgan Chase were given the FT/ITC Transformational Business Award for Achievement in Transformational Finance. The award is given by the Financial Times and the World Bank&#x27;s International Finance Corporation (IFC) for ground-breaking, commercially viable solutions to development challenges.

==Plant a Billion Trees campaign==
The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s &quot;Plant a Billion Trees&quot; campaign is an effort to plant one billion trees across the globe in forests with the greatest need and has been operating since 2008 to plant trees in Brazil, China, Colombia, Guatemala, Kenya, Tanzania, Mexico, and the United States. As part of the overall campaign, The Nature Conservancy pledged to plant 25 million trees as part of the launch of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)&#x27;s Billion Tree Campaign. This campaign encourages individuals and organizations to plant their own trees around the world and record this action on the website as a tally. Its &quot;Plant a Billion Trees&quot; campaign in Brazil aims to restore Brazil&#x27;s Atlantic Forest by planting native trees on that have been deforested.

=== Environmental benefits ===
The Plant a Billion Trees campaign has also been identified as a tool to help slow climate change with forest restoration being an effective way to help regulate emissions in the atmosphere and stabilize global climate.

== Operations ==
The Nature Conservancy has over one million members across the world . , it was the largest environmental non-profit organization by assets and revenue in the Americas.

=== Big business ties ===
The Nature Conservancy has ties to many large companies, including those in the oil, gas, mining, chemical and agricultural industries. , its board of directors included the retired chairman of Duke Energy, and executives from Merck, HP, Google and several financial industry groups. It also has a Business Council which it describes as a consultative forum that includes Bank of America, BP America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical, Duke Energy, General Mills, Royal Dutch Shell, and Starbucks. The organization faced criticism in 2010 from supporters for its refusal to cut ties with BP after the Gulf oil spill.

Writer and activist Naomi Klein has strongly criticized The Nature Conservancy for earning money from an oil well on land it controls in Texas and for its continued engagement with fossil fuel companies. The Nature Conservancy responded by arguing that it had no choice, under the terms of a lease it signed years prior with an oil and gas company and later came to regret.

In 2020, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; published an article claiming that some of the companies (such as JPMorgan Chase, Disney, and BlackRock) that purchase carbon credits from The Nature Conservancy were purchasing carbon credits for forests that did not need protection.

In 2021, The Nature Conservancy partnered with Amazon to compensate local farmers for restoring and protecting rainforests in Para, Brazil.

In 2022, a group of 158 conservation, environmental, and social justice non-profit organizations signed an open letter to the Conservancy&#x27;s CEO, Jennifer Morris, charging that The Nature Conservancy was overly supportive of logging interests and the use of wood products as a natural climate solution. TNC is a member of the Forest Climate Working Group alongside wood product companies like Weyerhaeuser and Enviva, and other conservation organizations like the Trust for Public Land and American Forests.

=== Efficiency and accountability ===

The Charity Navigator gave The Nature Conservancy a 4-star rating, with a score of 96%, for the 2022 fiscal year.

=== Hunting ===
Like many large environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and the World Wildlife Fund, the Conservancy includes allowances for hunting and fishing within its management policies. The organization does not totally ban hunting or fishing but defers to state hunting and fishing regulations.

===Publication===
The organization publishes &quot;The Nature Conservancy&quot; magazine (; six issues per year).

==Controversies==

===Land deals controversy===
In 2003 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran an investigative series about the Nature Conservancy with allegations of improper dealing and other improprieties that the Nature Conservancy contested. In part, the &quot;Post&quot; alleged the Conservancy had, time and again, bought ecologically significant tracts of land, attached some development restrictions and then resold the properties to trustees and supporters at greatly reduced prices. The sales were part of a program that limits intrusive development but generally allows buyers to build homes on the land. The buyers then gave the Conservancy cash that was roughly equivalent to the amount of the discounts. That allowed the new owners to take significant tax deductions for charitable gifts.

The Nature Conservancy suspended a range of practices shortly after the articles ran including these sales, licensing its logo to corporations whose executives sat on the Conservancy&#x27;s governing board and council, all new logging and other &quot;resource extraction activities&quot; such as oil and gas drilling on its nature preserves, and all new loans to employees. The Conservancy launched an independent review that issued its final report in 2004, calling for sweeping reforms aimed at making the Conservancy a model of ethical standards for nonprofit organizations.

===Sexual harassment investigation===
After service as The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s president for one year, Brian McPeek resigned on May 31, 2019, after a report on an internal investigation of sexual harassment was revealed by &quot;Politico&quot; and two other senior executives were ultimately dismissed based on its findings. On June 7, 2019, Mark Tercek, CEO since 2008, announced his resignation following the resignation of McPeek. On June 10, Luis Solorzano, executive director of The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s Florida-based Caribbean chapter, became the fifth senior official to depart the organization. On June 11, The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s board chairman Thomas J. Tierney announced that board member and former US Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell would serve as interim CEO, effective September 2019.

<text>STS-51-B was the 17th flight of the NASA Space Shuttle program and the seventh flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;. The launch of &quot;Challenger&quot; on April 29, 1985, was delayed by 2 minutes and 18 seconds, due to a launch processing failure. &quot;Challenger&quot; was initially rolled out to the pad to launch on the STS-51-E mission. The shuttle was rolled back when a timing issue emerged with the TDRS-B satellite. When STS-51-E was canceled, &quot;Challenger&quot; was remanifested with the STS-51-B payloads. The shuttle landed successfully on May 6, 1985, after a week-long mission.

== Crew ==

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission insignia ==
The mission insignia features the &quot;Challenger&quot; with her payload doors open, to show the onboard Spacelab 3. The orbiter rides over the American flag. The seven crewmembers are represented by the 7 stars on the patch, that indirectly refer to the Mercury Seven as a nod to their legacy. Behind the orbiter, the contours of Pegasus can be seen, as a reference to the European Space Agency (ESA). The white board surrounding it all has the appearance of a space suit helmet, with the names of the two respective teams grouped around them on a round band encircling the insignia, and the two mission specialists on an added section below. To further create some sort of contrast, the team colors are reprised for each member&#x27;s name.

== Mission summary ==
&quot;Challenger&quot; lifted off from Kennedy Space Center (KSC)&#x27;s launch pad 39A at 12:02:18 p.m. EDT on April 29, 1985. The crew members included Robert F. Overmyer, commander; Frederick D. Gregory, pilot; Don L. Lind, Norman E. Thagard and William E. Thornton, mission specialists; and Lodewijk van den Berg, of EG&amp;G Energy Management, Inc., and Taylor G. Wang, of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), both payload specialists. Average age of 48.6 was the oldest for an American space mission. Similar to the previous Spacelab mission (STS-9), the crew was divided roughly in half to cover 12-hour shifts, with Overmyer, Lind, Thornton and Wang forming the Gold team, and Gregory, Thagard and van den Berg as the Silver team.

STS-51-B was the second flight of the European Space Agency (ESA)&#x27;s Spacelab pressurized module, and the first with the Spacelab module in a fully operational configuration. Spacelab&#x27;s capabilities for multi-disciplinary research in microgravity were successfully demonstrated. The gravity gradient attitude of the orbiter proved quite stable, allowing the delicate experiments in materials processing and fluid mechanics to proceed normally. The crew operated around the clock in two 12-hour shifts. Two squirrel monkeys and 24 rats were flown in special cages, the second time American astronauts flew live non-human mammals aboard the shuttle. The crew members in orbit were supported 24 hours a day by a temporary Payload Operations Control Center, located at the Johnson Space Center.

An experiment designed by Taylor Wang malfunctioned upon activation. Wang, feeling immense pressure, received permission to attempt a fix and was successful in repairing the experiment, though remarks made by him caused concern for the safety of the crew and the mission. The incident was covered in an &quot;Ars Technica&quot; article on 22 January 2024. There, John Fabian, mission specialist on STS-51-G, the very next shuttle flight after 51-B, was cited to explain why a lock was recently installed on the door of the side hatch: &quot;It was installed when we got into orbit so that the door could not be opened from the inside and commit &quot;hara-kiri&quot;, kill the whole crew. That was not because of anybody we had on our flight but because of a concern about someone who had flown before 51-G.&quot;

On the mission, Spacelab carried 15 primary experiments, of which 14 were successfully performed. Two Getaway Special (GAS) experiments required that they be deployed from their canisters, a first for the program. These were NUSAT (Northern Utah Satellite) and GLOMR (Global Low Orbiting Message Relay satellite). NUSAT deployed successfully, but GLOMR did not deploy, and was returned to Earth.

A Cosmic Ray Experiment by Indian Space Research Organisation, named Anuradha was launched onboard the mission. It measured the ionization states of low energy cosmic rays in near-earth space. It consisted of a 
Barrel shaped recorder consisting of plastic sheets. It detected cosmic rays at the rate of seven a minute for 64 hours and produced 10000 sheets of data

&quot;Challenger&quot; landed safely at Edwards Air Force Base at 12:11:04 p.m. EDT on May 6, 1985, after a mission lasting 7 days, 8 minutes, and 46 seconds.

== Connection to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster ==
While participating in the investigation into the destruction of &quot;Challenger&quot; during STS-51L in 1986, Overmyer discovered that a problem with the shuttle&#x27;s O-rings, similar to that which led to the disaster, had emerged during the launch of STS-51B. Morton-Thiokol engineers told Lind after the mission that &quot;you came within three-tenths of one second of dying&quot;. It was the problem with the O-rings on the left solid rocket motor (SRM) on this launch (SRM-16A) that prompted Roger Boisjoly to write a memo to Bob Lund about the potential for the O-rings to cause catastrophic failure.

<text>Delaware State University (DSU or Del State) is a privately governed, state-assisted historically black land-grant research university in Dover, Delaware. DSU also has two satellite campuses: one in Wilmington and one in Georgetown. The university encompasses four colleges and a diverse population of undergraduate and advanced-degree students. Delaware State University is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
===19th century===
The Delaware College for Colored Students was established on May 15, 1891, by the Delaware General Assembly. The name was changed to the State College for Colored Students by state legislative action in 1893 to eliminate confusion with Delaware College, which was attended by whites in Newark, Delaware. It first awarded degrees in 1898. 

===20th century===
In 1945, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education awarded the college provisional accreditation. Three years later, the institution became Delaware State College by legislative action. Although its accreditation was revoked in 1949, it was regained in 1957. 

On July 1, 1993, the institution changed its name yet again, this time to Delaware State University. Delaware State University is one of the first historically black colleges and universities to have a no-smoking policy.

===21st century===
====2007 shooting====

On September 21, 2007, two 17-year-old Delaware State University freshmen were shot on campus. One died 32 days later on October 23, from critical injuries sustained in the attack. A freshman student from East Orange, New Jersey, Loyer D. Braden, was arrested and charged with murder.

====Other events====
In 2015, the university began phasing out smoking on campus by restricting it to four designated areas and providing educational resources on smoking cessation tools and programs. In August 2015 it implemented a completely tobacco-free policy. 

In 2017, the university received the ACAS Health Leadership Award in recognition of its efforts. The award was jointly presented by the Public Health Service Officers Foundation for the Advancement of Public Health, the Truth Initiative, Arizonans Concerned About Smoking and the Arizona NAACP.

In December 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $20 million to Delaware State University. Her donation is the largest single gift in the university&#x27;s history.

On July 1, 2021, Delaware State University officially finalized its acquisition of Wesley College, a 157-year-old private institution founded by the Methodist Church in 1873. This acquisition makes Delaware State the first historically Black university to acquire an institution that is not a historically Black college or university. 

The university has renamed the former Wesley campus &quot;DSU Downtown&quot;, reflecting its close proximity to downtown Dover, Delaware, and has relocated most of its College of Health and Behavioral Science (Public and Allied Health, Psychology, and Social Work programs on that additional 41-acre site. That academic division has been renamed the Wesley College of Health and Behavioral Sciences as a way to preserve the history of the former Wesley College.

==Campus==

The main campus in Dover, the capital of Delaware, is approximately a two-hour drive from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., and three hours from New York City. There university&#x27;s has two satellite campuses located in Wilmington and Georgetown.

The main campus in Dover contains thirty buildings, including:

* Administration Building
* Alumni Stadium
* The Bank of America Building
* Delaware Hall
* The Education and Humanities Building &amp; Theatre
* Loockerman Hall - listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.
* The Mishoe Science Center
* Price Building
* Willam C. Jason Library
* The Wellness and Recreation Center
* The Optical Science Center for Applied Research
On the main campus there are five main campus traditional residential halls and three apartment-style residence halls for upperclassmen on campus. Off-campus there is an apartment complex and an residential hall. In addition, the university has activated two residential halls at DSU Downtown (the former Wesley College campus). The residential facilities include:
* Harriet Tubman-Lydia Laws Hall
* Jenkins Hall
* Medgar Evers Hall
* Wynder Towers
* The Living and Learning Commons (off campus)
* University Courtyard Apartments (off campus)
* University Village Complex
* Warren-Franklin Hall 
* Malmberg Hall (DSU Downtown)
* Zimmerman Hall (DSU Downtown)
Two dining halls serve the more than 1,500 on-campus students.

As a part of the Internet2 initiative, the university maintains several research computer laboratories including a high-performance computational cluster in its DESAC center. Almost every building has a computer lab and each student has a dedicated data port for internet access, their own phone, a campus email address, and cable television access in all residence hall rooms. Most campus buildings also offer wireless connectivity.

DSU is one of 148 schools in the country to receive Tree Campus USA recognition from the Arbor Day Foundation. The university owns two farms near Kenton and Smyrna, and has an Airway Science Program based at Delaware Air Park in Cheswold.

==Administration==

Tony Allen became the 12th president of Delaware State University on January 1, 2020, after serving the previous two and a half years as the university&#x27;s provost and executive vice president. Three months into his presidency, Allen ended in-person classes and residential operations on campus following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the faculty began offering curriculum online. The university raised $1.5 million for a Student Emergency Relief Fund to address student needs brought on by COVID-19 crisis. Although the COVID-19 crisis continued throughout the year, Allen and the university reopened its residential halls for the fall semester 2020, allowing more than 1,700 students to resume their residency on campus while almost all classes continued to be held virtually.

The business and affairs of the university are governed by the board of trustees. The board of trustees has all the powers accorded it by Title 14, Chapter 65 of the Delaware Code. The board consists of 15 members whose appointment or election is provided for in the Delaware Code and the governor of the state and the president of the university who are ex officio members with voting rights.

==Academics==

The university consists of four colleges: 
*College of Agriculture, Science &amp; Technology
*College of Humanities, Education &amp; Social Sciences
*College of Business
*College of Health &amp; Behavioral Sciences

DSU offers 46 undergraduate degrees, 21 graduate degrees, and six doctoral degrees (interdisciplinary applied mathematics and mathematical physics, applied chemistry, neuroscience and optics, integrative agriculture, food &amp; environment, and educational leadership). The university also offers several cooperative and dual degree programs. Students receive instruction in classes with a 13:1 student-to-faculty ratio. About 80 percent of first-year undergraduates receive need-based financial aid. It has a traditional Honors Program and a Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) Honors Program to increase the number of students in science interested in pursuing biomedical research and obtaining doctor of philosophy degrees in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, and biopsychology.

In addition to satisfying the requirements for the major or majors and any minor, all undergraduates are required to complete the General Education Program, which includes: seven core courses, twelve foundation courses (across the curriculum), and the Senior Capstone Experience.

Accreditations include the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN), the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), the Accreditation Council for Programs in Hospitality Administration (ACPHA), the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), and the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetic Education (CCDE). The university&#x27;s College of Business is accredited nationally and internationally by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

===Aviation program===
DSU&#x27;s Aviation Program provides students with education and experience in preparation for careers in the aviation industry. Curricula in the program lead to a B.Sc. degree with concentrations in Aviation Management or Professional Pilot. Professional Pilot graduates will complete their Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements for Private Pilot, Instrument, Commercial, Multi-Engine and Certified Flight Instructor ratings while earning their bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Delaware State operates the only full-service, university-based flight school in the mid-Atlantic area. The Aviation program is approved by the State of Delaware Education Department for Veterans Flight Training.

===Research===
The institution has greatly increased its research endeavors over the past several years, as it has developed the research infrastructure needed to attract federal grants for projects in the following DSU Research Centers and in the sciences and mathematics:

*Applied Mathematics Research Center
*Center for Applied Optics
*Center for Research and Education in Optical Sciences and Applications (CREOSA) (a National Science Foundation-Center for Research Excellence (NSF-CREST))
*Center for Applied Optics for Space Science (CAOSS) (a National Aeronautics and Space Administration University Research Center (NASA-URC))

<text>Bharathan Parameshwara Menon Palissery (14 November 1946 – 30 July 1998) Known monoymously Bharathan was an Indian film maker, artist, and art director. Bharathan is noted for being the founder of a new school of film making in Malayalam cinema, along with Padmarajan and K. G. George, in the 1980s, which created films that were widely received while also being critically acclaimed. A train of directors, and screenwriters followed this school onto the 1990s including Sibi Malayil, Kamal, Lohithadas and Jayaraj.

==Early life==
He was born at Enkakkad near Wadakkancherry, in present-day Thrissur district of Kerala, India to Parameshwara Menon Palissery and Karthiyayini Amma

==Career==
===Art direction===
After completing his diploma from the College of Fine Arts, Thrissur, Bharathan entered films as an art director through the Malayalam film &quot;Gandharavakshetram&quot; (1972), directed by A. Vincent, which also happened to be one of the first films where actor Thilakan played a noticeable role. He was inspired by his uncle P. N. Menon, an established director. After working as an art director and assistant director in a few films, he made his directorial debut in 1975 with &quot;Prayanam&quot;, which was based on Padmarajan&#x27;s script. It also marked the rise of two early proponents of middle-stream Malayalam cinema.

===Film direction===
Bharathan directed over 40 films in Malayalam and Tamil. Starting his career in 1975 with Prayanam, Bharathan rode to fame with his off-beat Thakara, a film about a dumb-witted central character who falls in love with the village beauty. Some of his other memorable films include &quot;Rathinirvedam&quot;, &quot;Chamaram&quot;, &quot;Paalangal&quot;, &quot;Amaram&quot;, and &quot;Vaishali&quot;.

His association with Padmarajan led to films including &quot;Rathi Nirvedam&quot; and &quot;Thakara&quot;. &quot;Rathi Nirvedam&quot; was a treatment of teenage sexual angst. In &quot;Thakara&quot;, he deals with the life and longings of an intellectually disabled youth and his association with society.

In the early 1980s, he made several notable movies like &quot;Chamaram&quot;, &quot;Marmaram&quot;, &quot;Paalangal&quot;, &quot;Ormakkayi&quot;, &quot;Kattathe Kilikkoodu&quot;, &quot;Kathodu Kathoram&quot;, and many more. They did well in theatres and set the trend for meaningful mainstream cinema. Other noted directors followed suit. It was the romantic era of Malayalam cinema.

Not all of Bharathan&#x27;s films skirted with bold themes and controversy. In &quot;Oru Minnaaminunginte Nurunguvettam&quot; (1987), he tells the poignant story of a childless couple in their post-retirement life. It deals with the isolation and loneliness that come with old age. The film was a departure from Bharathan&#x27;s usual style and proved to be a major commercial hit while garnering critical acclaim, too. 

His &quot;Vaisali&quot; (1988) is widely regarded as a modern-day masterpiece in Malayalam cinema. Scripted by the iconic Malayalam novelist M. T. Vasudevan Nair, it was an adaptation of a sub-story told in the epic Mahabharata. Another movie born from their association was &quot;Thazhvaram&quot;. The subject was revenge, a theme quite uncharacteristic of Bharathan movies. The style was inspired by classic Westerns with a brooding, reticent central character and expansive shots of barren landscape. Another movie was Amaram, which was written by A. K. Lohithadas and starred Mammootty, which was a milestone movie of the Malayalam movie of the 1990s. 

Even though he was not known to cater to the star-centric system, Bharathan was instrumental in bringing together the two screen icons of Tamil cinema Sivaji Ganesan and Kamal Haasan in the Tamil film Thevar Magan, written by Kamal Haasan, which won critical acclaim and became an Industry Hit in Tamil cinema. Sivaji gave an uncharacteristically restrained yet brilliant performance. The movie won several National Awards and was remade into many regional languages (most notably &quot;Virasat&quot; in Hindi).

His more experimental films include &quot;Aaravam&quot;, more an arthouse than a commercial venture, and &quot;Nidra&quot;, about the plight of a woman who is in love with a mentally deranged man. His film &quot;Nidra&quot; was remade by his son, film director Sidharth Bharathan. &quot;Rathinirvedam&quot;, originally directed by Bharathan, which was a noted film, was also remade by another famous director, T. K. Rajeev Kumar, with Swetha Menon in the lead.

Apart from film direction, he also wrote lyrics and tuned songs for his films. (e.g., lyrics for &quot;Thaaram Valkannadi Nokki&quot; in &quot;Keli&quot; and &quot;Tharum Thalirum Mizhipootti&quot; in &quot;Chilambu&quot; or title song for &quot;Kathodu Kathoram&quot;). He collaborated with writer P. R. Nathan in &quot;Keli&quot;.

==Filmmaking style==

Bharathan&#x27;s films were known for their realistic portrayal of rural life in Kerala. Melodrama and escapism, often integral parts of mainstream cinema in India, were usually absent in his films. He also managed to steer clear of the &quot;star-centric&quot; culture prevalent in Indian cinema throughout his career. His later films did involve major movie stars, but usually without compromising on plot or narrative. Bharathan, along with Padmarajan and K. G. George, were largely responsible for introducing a counterculture of meaningful mainstream cinema, which often tread the middle path between arthouse and commercial cinema. This movement was often called the &quot;middle of the road cinema.&quot; Bharathan&#x27;s films were known for their visually appealing shot compositions. His background as a painter enabled him to create frames that were often credited for their visual beauty. Natural props and nature itself often became important characters in his films (like the railway track in &quot;Palangal&quot; or the sea in &quot;Amaram&quot;). Bharathan is one of the few Indian directors known to use an elaborate storyboard system for filming. He also often designed the posters for his films.

Several of his early films were known for their bold portrayal of sexual themes. His films often defied social conventions and norms about man-woman relationships. &quot;Rathinirvedam&quot; was the sexual-coming-of-age story of the relationship between a teenager and an older woman, while &quot;Chamaram&quot; dealt with the tumultuous affair between a student and his college lecturer. In &quot;Kattathe Kilikkoodu&quot;, an elderly, married professor falls for his student. &quot;Kaathodu Kaathoram&quot; was about the social ostracism of a woman who has an adulterous relationship.

The latter half of Bharathan&#x27;s career saw a distinct change in filmmaking style characterised by a wider canvas, more attention to detail, and a more distinct focus on narrative style (e.g., &quot;Vaishali&quot;, &quot;Amaram&quot;, &quot;Thaazhvaaram&quot;, and &quot;Thevar Magan&quot;). Some critics argue that this quest for technical excellence was at the expense of the quality of thematic content. Films like &quot;Vaishali&quot; and &quot;Amaram&quot; (where he collaborated with acclaimed cinematographer Madhu Ambat) set a new benchmark for cinematographic excellence in Malayalam and Indian Cinema. &quot;Thaazhvaaram&quot; was stylistically inspired by classic Hollywood Westerns, though the theme and backdrop were distinctly original.

His last few films (&quot;Manjeeradhwani&quot;, &quot;Devaraagam&quot;, and &quot;Churam&quot;) were received moderately by critics.

==Death==
Bharatan died at a private hospital in Chennai on 30 July 1998 at the age of 52 following prolonged illness. His last film was &quot;Churam&quot;, which released a year before his death. His mortal remains were brought back to his ancestral home at Wadakkancherry and cremated with full state honours.

==Personal Life==

Bharathan was married to theatre and film actress K. P. A. C. Lalitha with whom he associated in a lot of films before and after marriage. They had two children - Sreekutty, a former child actress, and Sidharth Bharathan, a film actor and director.

<text>The Dolby Theatre (formerly known as the Kodak Theatre) is a live-performance auditorium in the Ovation Hollywood shopping mall and entertainment complex, on Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States. Since its opening on November 9, 2001, it has been the venue of the annual Academy Awards ceremony. It is adjacent to Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre and opposite the El Capitan Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard.

Besides the Academy Awards, the venue has hosted other concerts and theatrical performances.

== Architecture ==
The theater was designed by David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group specifically with the Oscar ceremonies in mind. Though the stage is one of the largest in the United States—roughly tied with the Elliott Hall of Music at Purdue University—measuring wide and deep, its seating capacity is only about half that of the Hall of Music, accommodating 3,332 people.

The auditorium has become known as a venue for televised theatrical performances (e.g., &quot;American Idol&quot; and the Academy Awards). The architectural team consulted extensively with leading production personnel in Hollywood, achieving a highly functional cable infrastructure, with an underground cable bunker that crosses under the theater to truck locations on adjacent streets. Power is also substantial and accessible. The theater has a unique Rockwell-designed cockpit in the orchestra seating area for camera, sound, and stage management.

The hall from the front entrance to the grand stairway (leading up to the theater at the rear of the shopping complex) is flanked by storefronts, as well as Art Deco columns displaying the names of past recipients of the Academy Award for Best Picture (with blank spaces left for future Best Picture winners, currently set up to 2071). In a fashion reminiscent of Hollywood movie-making, the building is dressed before the Academy Awards ceremony, sometimes with a different sign on its façade, red drapery to hide its storefronts, and the famous red carpet running up its grand stairway.

== History ==
The theater was developed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to overcome logistical issues it faced hosting the Academy Awards at other venues, such as the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and Shrine Auditorium. In August 1997, AMPAS and Canadian development firm TrizecHahn went into negotiations over the development of an entertainment complex located on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue adjacent to the Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. Seven months later, both the Academy and TrizecHahn agreed on a twenty-year lease that allowed for the ceremony to be staged at the new venue.

The Academy Awards were first hosted at the new theater for its 74th edition in 2002, marking the first time it was held in Hollywood since the 32nd ceremony at the Pantages Theatre in 1960. It has been the venue for all Academy Awards ceremonies held since, with the only exception being the 93rd Academy Awards in 2021—which were downsized and moved to Union Station due to the COVID-19 pandemic in California.

The theater was sponsored, until February 2012, by the Eastman Kodak Company, which paid $75 million for naming rights to the building. In early 2012, Eastman Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection, thus ending its naming-rights deal. Then the theater&#x27;s name was temporarily changed to the Hollywood and Highland Center at the suggestion of the venue&#x27;s landlord.

On May 1, 2012, it was announced that the venue would be renamed the Dolby Theatre, after Dolby Laboratories signed a 20-year naming rights deal. Dolby updated the sound system first by installing Dolby Atmos. The company plans to continue updating the auditorium with newer technologies as they become available.

== Other events ==
Besides the Academy Awards, the theatre has hosted other award presentations. The American Film Institute has held its Life Achievement Award gala at the theatre, It hosted the 3rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2002.

The venue hosted Miss USA 2004 and Miss USA 2007.

From September 2011 until early 2013, the venue hosted &quot;Iris&quot;, a Cirque du Soleil residency show inspired by the history of cinema. Significant changes were made to the theater to accommodate the show, including adding lifts deep under the original floor. It was announced on November 29, 2012, that &quot;Iris&quot; would close on January 19, 2013, after only two seasons, due to lack of profit.

The reality music competition series &quot;American Idol&quot; hosted its season finales from the Dolby Theatre during its original run on Fox from 2002, 2004-2007, and 2015-2016. From 2016-2019 and 2021, the theatre hosted the live shows of the NBC reality competition series &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

The Sonic Symphony held a concert at the Dolby Theatre on September 30, 2023, featuring Johnny Gioeli and Jun Senoue of Crush 40.

The venue is set to host the MAMA Awards on November 21, 2024.

<text>Stetson is an American brand of hat manufactured by the John B. Stetson Company. &quot;Stetson&quot; is also used as a generic trademark to refer to any campaign hat, particularly in Scouting.

John B. Stetson gained inspiration for his most famous hats when he headed west from his native New Jersey for health reasons. On his return east in 1865, he founded the John B. Stetson Company in Philadelphia. He created a hat that has become symbolic of the pioneering American West, the &quot;Boss of the Plains&quot;. This Western hat would become the cornerstone of Stetson&#x27;s hat business and is still in production today.

Stetson eventually became the world&#x27;s largest hat maker, producing more than 3,300,000 hats a year in a factory spread over in Philadelphia. In addition to its Western and fashion hats, Stetson also produces fragrance, apparel, footwear, eyewear, belts, bourbon, and other products evoking the historic American West.

Stetson University and Stetson University College of Law in Florida were named after John B. Stetson in 1899 for his contributions to the school. The university&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Hatters, and the official mascot is known as &quot;John B.&quot;

==Prospector&#x27;s hat==
John B. Stetson was born in 1830 in Orange, New Jersey, where his father, Stephen Stetson, was a hatter. He worked in his father&#x27;s shop until he went West for his health. Stetson created a rugged hat for himself made from thick beaver felt while panning for gold in Colorado. According to legend, Stetson invented the hat while on a hunting trip while showing his companions how he could make cloth out of fur without tanning. Fur felt hats are lighter, they maintain their shape, and withstand weather and renovation better.

Stetson made an unusually large hat from felt he made from hides collected on the trip and wore the hat for the remainder of the expedition. Although initially worn as a joke, Stetson soon grew fond of the hat for its ability to protect him from the elements. It had a wide brim, a high crown to keep an insulating pocket of air on the head, and was used to carry water.

As their travels continued, a cowboy is said to have seen J. B. Stetson and his unusual hat, rode up, tried the hat on for himself, and paid Stetson for it with a five dollar gold piece, riding off with the first western Stetson hat on his head.

==Boss of the Plains==
Stetson&#x27;s western adventures came to an end in 1865. Stetson, then 35 years old and in better health, returned east and established his own hat firm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which produced high-quality hats for outdoor use. After producing some initial designs based on popular styles of the day, Stetson decided to create a hat based on his experiences in the American West, which he called the &quot;Boss of the Plains&quot;. The high-crowned, wide-brimmed, soft-felt western hats that followed are intimately associated with the American cowboy image.

The original &quot;Boss&quot;, manufactured by Stetson in 1865, was flat-brimmed, had a straight-sided crown with rounded corners. These lightweight, waterproof hats were natural in color, with four-inch crowns and brims. A plain hatband was fitted to adjust head size. The sweatband bore John B. Stetson&#x27;s name.

==Mass production==
Stetson sent a sample hat to merchants throughout the Southwest with a letter asking for a minimum order of a dozen &quot;Boss of the Plains&quot; hats. The hat was an immediate success: in less than a year, Stetson set up a new factory in the outskirts of Philadelphia to handle his growing business. According to Bender, within a decade the name Stetson had become synonymous with the word &quot;hat&quot; almost everywhere in the West. By 1886, Stetson&#x27;s hat company was the largest globally and had mechanized the hat-making industry (&quot;producing close to 2 million hats a year by 1906&quot;). The Stetson Hat Co. ceased production in 1968 and licensed another hat company. However, these hats still bear the Stetson name, with the hats produced in St. Joseph, Missouri. Later the license was transferred to another hat company in Texas.

Stetson also produced &quot;dress&quot; hats, distinguished from &quot;western&quot; hats by narrower brims and shorter crowns. However, his &quot;Boss of the Plains&quot; style hat and its many variants fueled the company&#x27;s growth and fame.

== Singing cowboys and ten-gallon hats ==
In the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a hat was an indispensable item in every man&#x27;s wardrobe. Stetson focused on expensive, high-quality hats that represented a real investment for the working cowboy and a statement of success for the city dweller.

Early on, Stetson hats became associated with legends of the West, including &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, Calamity Jane, Will Rogers, and Annie Oakley. George Custer allegedly rode into the Battle of Little Big Horn wearing a Stetson. Later on, Western movie cowboys were quick to adopt the Stetson; many were drawn to the largest, most flamboyant styles available.

Texans were known for their preference for the &quot;Ten Gallon&quot; model. According to Win Blevins&#x27; &quot;Dictionary of the American West&quot; (p. 388), the term &quot;ten-gallon&quot; has nothing to do with the hat&#x27;s liquid capacity but derives from the Spanish word &quot;galón&quot; (braid), ten indicating the number of braids used as a hatband. However, an early Stetson advertising image, a painting of a cowboy dipping his hat into a stream to provide water for his horse, symbolized the cowboy hat as an essential part of a stockman&#x27;s gear and was later featured inside every western style hat.

== Changing fashions ==

Stetson also produced women&#x27;s hats, operating a millinery department from the 1930s to 1950s. Hat sales suffered during the Depression years, but Stetsons remained ubiquitous until Americans&#x27; embrace of headwear faded after WWII. Stetson had operations in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Finland, Guatemala, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, and West Germany at its peak.

Stetson changed its business strategy in the early 1970s, closing its Philadelphia factory in 1971 and continuing in the hat business through licensing arrangements with several manufacturers.

Popular demand for western-style hats spiked during the 1980s after the success of Indiana Jones and Urban Cowboy movies. Both western and dress hats continue to be popular men&#x27;s accessories.

===Diversification===
In the 1980s, Stetson began to diversify, releasing the first Stetson cologne in 1981 and Lady Stetson in 1986. Luggage, handbags, umbrellas, and scarves also carried the Stetson mark. Currently, the brand carries western hats, fashion hats, fragrances, eyewear, apparel, footwear, belts, accessories, and bourbon. Stetson is available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Asia.

==Military and police uniforms==

===United States===

The hat was first sold in Central City, Colorado, in 1865 in a style called the &quot;Boss of the Plains.&quot; In some versions of the famous American folk ballad &quot;Stagger Lee,&quot; Billy Lyons is killed by Stack A Lee over a Stetson hat. Troopers of modern-day U.S. Army cavalry regiments will often wear a Cavalry Stetson on ceremonial occasions in place of the ACU patrol cap or beret.

The Homicide and Robbery Bureau of the Dallas Police used the Stetson hat as a badge of office.

In addition, on April Fools&#x27; Day, 2011, the U.S. Army released a humorous statement that the official black beret of the Army would be replaced by Stetsons. The statement was supplemented by pictures of soldiers with Stetsons photoshopped over their berets, including an Army dog toting a Stetson.

The Legion of Frontiersmen created in 1905 in England also wore the Stetson, as well as the South African Constabulary, organized by Robert Baden-Powell in 1901.

===Canadian military===

In the Second Boer War, the flat-brimmed Stetson became the standard issue of the 2nd Canadian Contingent, becoming recognized throughout the British Empire as a symbol of Canada. Twelve hundred Canadian troops were part of the South African Constabulary under the leadership of Robert Baden-Powell, and it was after seeing these troops in action at the Relief of Mafeking that Baden-Powel ordered 10,000 of these hats for the British Troops under his command.

===Canadian police===
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Red Serge dress uniform includes a Stetson with a flat brim. The Stetson was first used unofficially by the North-West Mounted Police, in place of the traditional white pith helmet, not practical for the Canadian West. The color for the RCMP Stetson is sometimes referred to as &quot;Belgian Belly&quot;; it is a reddish buff, pastel-like color of the underfur of the Belgian hare. It is also a very little-used &quot;second name&quot; for the Stetson. Although called a Stetson, the hat type is similar to a campaign hat.

The Ontario Provincial Police also wore the Stetson (grey woven fabric) as part of their uniform from 1909 to 1930s and again from 1997 to 2009.

The Calgary Police Service may wear a black Stetson as an optional part of their uniform, reflecting the city&#x27;s western roots and cowboy heritage. Although worn by some officers year-round, the hat is especially prominent during the Calgary Stampede.

<text>Kulakkattil Geevarghese George (24 May 1946 – 24 September 2023) was an Indian filmmaker and screenwriter who worked in the Malayalam cinema. He was the founder of a new school of film making in Malayalam cinema, along with Bharathan and P. Padmarajan, in the 1980s. He was awarded the J. C. Daniel Award, Government of Kerala&#x27;s highest honour for contributions to the Malayalam cinema.

George made his debut with &quot;Swapnadanam&quot; (1975) which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam. His well-known films include &quot;Ulkkadal&quot; (1979), &quot;Mela&quot; (1980), &quot;Yavanika&quot; (1982), &quot;Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback&quot; (1983), &quot;Adaminte Vaariyellu&quot; (1983), &quot;Panchavadi Palam&quot; (1984), &quot;Irakal&quot; (1986), and &quot;Mattoral&quot; (1988). He was a recipient of 9 Kerala State Film Awards for his various films. 

George was the founder and chairman of the Malayalam Cine Technicians Association (MACTA), and continued to be an executive member. He was the chairman of the Kerala State Film Development Corporation.

== Early life ==
George was born to Samuel and Annamma as their eldest son on 24 May 1946 in Thiruvalla. After his diploma from Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune, K. G. George started his film career as the assistant to director Ramu Kariat. He made his directorial debut with &quot;Swapnadanam&quot; (1975) and became a strong presence in the new cinema movement that became active during the early 1970s. The film institute may have exposed him to the magic of cinema, but his stint as an assistant to the legendary Ramu Kariat in the celebrated &quot;Nellu&quot; must have instilled in him that quality to gel cinematic norms with commercial elements. He was given the tag of a &#x27;via media director&#x27; together with Padmarajan, Bharathan and Mohan, which was a big compliment in the 1980s when most of his movies were hits.

== Film career ==
His debut movie &quot;Swapnadanam&quot; was a commercial success while maintaining its artistic quality. It was a marital psychodrama, &quot;Swapnadanam&quot; rejected all the usual song-dance numbers of popular cinema, yet succeeded in reaching the common mass. Later he turned to the middle-stream cinema and produced some of the best works of Malayalam cinema, which became highly popular with the masses. It was a commercial success as well as critically acclaimed and won several awards. &quot;Swapnadanam&quot; won the Kerala State Film Award for best film. Another of his movies was released in 1980, &quot;Kolangal&quot; smithereens the common romantic concept about an interior village of Kerala filled with virtues and happiness. Here a village is shown in the clutches of wildfire of jealousy. &quot;Yavanika&quot; stands out as one of the most commercially successful, yet artistically superior films of the 1980s. In the form of a detective thriller, &quot;Yavanika&quot; explores backstage drama of a travelling drama troupe. It won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film. K. G. George uses the cinema within cinema technique for this film. With hints to the real life incident of suicide of popular actress Shobha, &quot;Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback&quot; became controversial even before its release. He used a new narrative technique &quot;Adaminte Variyellu&quot;, by telling the story of unhappy marital lives and oppressions suffered by three urban women. Based on a short story by Veloor Krishnankutty, George&#x27;s &quot;Panchavadi Palam&quot; is a satirical comedy with an intentionally exaggerated story line and caricature-like characters. It works almost as a political cartoon. &quot;Irakal&quot; is an in-depth exploration of the psychology of violence. A ruthless rubber baron, Mathukutty, disregards the prevailing moral standards and spawns criminal sons as well as a sexually wayward daughter, Annie. His son, Baby, is a psychotic strangler who uses a nylon wire and is eventually shot dead by his repentant father.

George&#x27;s last movie was released in 1998, &quot;Elavamkodu Desam&quot;, a period movie released when mimicry movies ruled the roost. &quot;The audience somehow did not relate to this movie,&quot; he says sadly. In between his first film &quot;Swapnadanam&quot; and &quot;Elavamkodu Desam&quot;, he created milestones in Malayalam cinema. Seven of his movies were screened at different international festivals.

George released his memoir &quot;Flashback Enteyum Cinemayudeyum&quot; in 2012. In 2018, a documentary on the films and life of K G George named 8½ Intercuts: Life and Films of K.G. George directed by film maker Lijin Jose was released.

==Death==
K. G. George died at a retirement home in Kakkanad, on 24 September 2023, at the age of 77. He was undergoing treatment for a stroke. He had been a resident there for the past five years, after suffering from a massive stroke. During the last days of his life, his condition had been much worse, and the end came at 11:00 AM.

<doc id="497614" wikidata="Q333745" url="?curid=497614" title="Patrick Gordon Walker">
<text>Patrick Chrestien Gordon Walker, Baron Gordon-Walker, (7 April 1907 – 2 December 1980) was a British Labour Party politician. He was a Member of Parliament for nearly 30 years and twice a cabinet minister. He lost his Smethwick parliamentary seat at the 1964 general election in a bitterly racial campaign conducted in the wake of local factory closures.

==Early life==
Born in Worthing, Sussex, Gordon Walker was the son of Alan Lachlan Gordon Walker, a Scottish judge in the Indian Civil Service. He was educated at Wellington College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a second in modern history in 1928 and subsequently gained a B. Litt. He was a student (fellow) in history at Christ Church from 1931 until 1941.

From 1940 to 1944, Gordon Walker worked for the BBC&#x27;s European Service, where from 1942 he arranged the BBC&#x27;s daily broadcasts of the BBC German Service. In 1945, he worked as assistant director of the BBC&#x27;s German Service working from Radio Luxembourg, travelling with the British forces. He broadcast about the liberation of the German concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, and wrote a book on the subject called &quot;The Lid Lifts&quot;.

From 1946 to 1948, he was chairman of the British Film Institute.

==Political career==
He first stood for parliament at the 1935 general election, when he was unsuccessful in the Conservative-held Oxford constituency.

In 1938, he was selected to stand again in the Oxford by-election. The Liberal Party had selected Ivor Davies, who offered to stand down from the by-election if Labour did the same and backed a Popular Front candidate against the Conservatives. Eventually, Gordon Walker reluctantly stood down and both parties supported Sandy Lindsay as an Independent Progressive. Quintin Hogg, the Conservative candidate, defeated Lindsay in the by-election.

Gordon Walker did not contest the 1945 general election, but was elected later in 1945 as member of Parliament (MP) for Smethwick in a by-election on 1 October 1945 after Labour&#x27;s Alfred Dobbs was killed in a car accident the day after winning the seat at the 1945 general election. After the by-election, Gordon Walker&#x27;s support in the constituency gradually declined.

Once in parliament, Gordon Walker was promoted rapidly through the ranks of Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour government. In 1946, he was appointed a parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Herbert Morrison, the leader of the House of Commons. From 1947 to 1950, he was a parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Commonwealth Relations Office, and in 1950 he joined the cabinet as Secretary of state for Commonwealth relations, serving until Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 1951 general election.

As Commonwealth secretary in 1950, Gordon Walker persuaded the cabinet to agree to prevent Seretse Khama, the heir to the throne of the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, from becoming its king, on the grounds that he had married a white English woman, Ruth Williams, an inter-racial marriage that had upset Bechuanaland&#x27;s neighbouring state, apartheid South Africa.

Khama had been brought to Britain by the government under false pretences, ostensibly to talk about his future, and at Gordon Walker&#x27;s behest he was then prevented from returning to his homeland for five years, subsequently increased to a lifetime ban (although eventually rescinded by a later, Conservative, government). Khama said the unexpected and earth shattering news of his exile was given to him by Gordon Walker in an &quot;unemotional&quot; and &quot;unfeeling&quot; manner. &quot;I doubt that any man has been asked to give up his birthright in such cold, calculating terms,&quot; he said.

After the 1964 general election, following a successful career in opposition, Gordon Walker became foreign secretary in the Labour government; he had held the shadow role for the previous year.

Although Labour did win that election to end 13 years of Conservative rule, Gordon Walker was defeated in controversial circumstances by the Conservative candidate, Peter Griffiths. Smethwick had been a focus of immigration from the Commonwealth but the economic and industrial growth of the years following the Second World War were coupled with local factory closures, an ageing population and a lack of modern housing. Griffiths ran a campaign critical of the opposition&#x27;s, and the government&#x27;s, policies, including immigration policies. Griffiths&#x27; supporters made wide use of the slogan &quot;If you want a nigger neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour&quot;. Griffiths did not accept that he had invented the slogan, but steadfastly refused to condemn it.

Despite, therefore, not being an MP or peer able to answer to Parliament, Gordon Walker was appointed to the Foreign Office by Harold Wilson. To resolve this unusual situation, he stood for the normally &quot;safe&quot; Labour constituency of Leyton in the Leyton by-election in January 1965; however, he lost, and was finally forced to resign as foreign secretary. After a sabbatical conducting research in Southeast Asia, he finally won Leyton in the 1966 general election. Following this election, he sat in the cabinet in 1967–68, first as minister without portfolio, then as secretary of state for education and science. On his retirement from the cabinet in 1968, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

Gordon Walker retired from the House of Commons at the February 1974 general election. On 4 July that year, he was made a life peer as Baron Gordon-Walker, &quot;of Leyton in Greater London&quot;, in 1974 and was briefly a member of the European Parliament.

==Personal life==
In 1934 he married Audrey Muriel Rudolf. They subsequently had twin sons and three daughters. Lord Gordon-Walker died in London in 1980, aged 73.

<doc id="497619" wikidata="Q2721855" url="?curid=497619" title="Mammootty">
<text>Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail (born 7 September 1951), known mononymously by the hypocorism Mammootty (), is an Indian actor and film producer who works predominantly in Malayalam-language films. He has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and English-language productions. In a prolific career spanning five decades, he has appeared in more than 400 films, predominantly in lead roles. He is the recipient of several accolades, including three National Film Awards, eleven Kerala State Film Awards, eleven Kerala Film Critics Awards and fifteen Filmfare Awards South. He was honored with the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian award by the Government of India in 1998, for his contributions to cinema. He was also honored with the Kerala Prabha Award by the Government of Kerala in 2022. Mammootty was named as one of &quot;the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema&quot; by CNN.

Mammootty made his debut in acting through Malayalam film &quot;Anubhavangal Paalichakal&quot; in 1971. His first leading role was in M. T. Vasudevan Nair&#x27;s unreleased film &quot;Devalokam&quot; (1979). Mammootty&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1981 when he received the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Ahimsa&quot;. Major commercial successes during this time included the 1983 films &quot;Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu&quot; and &quot;Aa Raathri&quot;. Following a series of box office failures, the 1987 crime thriller &quot;New Delhi&quot; improved his commercial prospects. The films that followed through the next decade established Mammootty as one of the leading stars of Malayalam cinema.

The 2000s were a period of critical and commercial success for him. His performance in the Hindi and English-language bilingual biopic &quot;Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar&quot; (2000) won him the National Film Award for Best Actor, and he won Kerala State Film Awards for &quot;Kaazcha&quot; (2004) and &quot;Paleri Manikyam&quot; (2009). He garnered further critical praise for the satire &quot;Pranchiyettan &amp; the Saint&quot; (2010), drama &quot;Varsham&quot; (2014), period drama &quot;Pathemari&quot; (2015) and black comedy &quot;Unda&quot; (2019), and received Filmfare Awards for Best Actor for the first three. His highest-grossing releases include the action comedy &quot;Madhura Raja&quot; (2019), the action thriller &quot;Bheeshma Parvam&quot; (2022), and the crime thriller &quot;Kannur Squad&quot; (2023).

He is the chairman of Malayalam Communications, which runs the Malayalam television channels Kairali TV, Kairali News, and Kairali We. He is the owner of multiple production ventures, including the distribution-production banner, Playhouse, and production company, Mammootty Kampany. In August 2021, Mammootty received UAE Golden Visa.

== Early life and family ==

Mammootty was born on 7 September 1951 in Chandiroor. He was raised in the village of Chempu near Vaikom in Kottayam district in the present-day state of Kerala, India in a middle-class Muslim family. His father, Ismail, had a wholesale garment and rice business and was involved in rice cultivation. His mother, Fatima, was a housewife. He is their eldest son. He has two younger brothers, Ibrahimkutty and Zakariah, and three younger sisters, Ameena, Sauda and Shafina.

He went to Government High School, Kulasekharamangalam, Kottayam for his primary education. In the 1960s, his father moved the family to Kochi, where he attended Government School Ernakulam. He did his pre-university course (pre-degree) at Sacred Heart College, Thevara. He attended Maharaja&#x27;s College, Ernakulam, for his degree. He graduated with an LL.B. from Government Law College, Ernakulam. He practised law for two years in Manjeri.

He married Sulfath Kuttyy in 1979 in an arranged marriage. The couple has a daughter Surumi (born 1982), and a son Dulquer Salmaan (born 1986)—also an actor. He resides in Kochi with his family. His younger brother, Ibrahimkutty, has also acted in Malayalam films. His nephews, Maqbool Salmaan and Ashkar Saudan, are Malayalam film and television actors.

== Film career ==
=== 1971–1982: Early career ===
Mammootty made his onscreen debut as an extra in K. S. Sethumadhavan’s &quot;Anubhavangal Paalichakal&quot; (1971) at the age of 20. He made his second appearance in an uncredited role in the 1973 film &quot;Kaalachakram,&quot; directed by K. Narayanan. He was cast in a small role as a boatman. It was in this film that he said his first dialogue. In 1975, he acted in the theatre drama &quot;Sabarmathi&quot;. After his graduation from Maharaja’s college in 1976, Mammootty began his practice as a lawyer in Manjeri. During this time, he met his mentor M. T. Vasudevan Nair, who cast him in a pivotal role in &quot;Devalokam&quot; (1979). However, due to financial constraints and conflicts among cast and crew, the film stopped shooting halfway. As the film did not get a release Vasudevan Nair cast him in a minor role in &quot;Vilkkanundu Swapnangal&quot; (1980), directed by Azad and scripted by Nair, his first credited role.

During the filming of &quot;Vilkkanundu Swapnangal,&quot; Mammootty met and got closer to Sreenivasan. When K. G. George was looking for a newcomer with a “smart and handsome personality” as a daredevil motorcycle jumper for his film &quot;Mela&quot; (1980), Sreenivasan suggested Mammooty&#x27;s name while they were shooting at the Raymon circus at Ernakulam. &quot;Mela&quot; was the first Malayalam film to feature him in a prominent role. He was then cast in a supporting role in Vijayachithra Combines’ big budget action film &quot;Sphodanam&quot; (1981), directed by P. G. Vishwambharan. He was credited as &quot;Sajin&quot; in the film as Vishwanbharan felt that the name &quot;Mammootty&quot; did not suit an actor. The same year, he made his first-ever appearance as a lead actor in the Malayalam film &quot;Thrishna&quot; (1981), which won the Filmfare Award for Best Film. Later that year, he appeared in a supporting role in I. V. Sasi’s political film &quot;Ahimsa&quot; (1981), which earned him the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor.

The next year, he starred alongside Bharath Gopy in K. G. George’s epoch making &quot;Yavanika&quot; (1982), as a police inspector who is on the search for an unpopular tabla player of a travelling drama group who suddenly disappears. Jijo Punnoose experimented Mammootty in a negative role in the epic period drama &quot;Padayottam&quot; (1982). I. V. Sasi cast him in a pivotal role in &quot;John Jaffer Janardhanan&quot; (1982), the Malayalam remake of Manmohan Desai’s Hindi film &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977). He was then cast in a major supporting role in Sasi’s political drama &quot;Ee Nadu&quot; (1982), which was a major commercial success, becoming the highest grossing South Indian film of the year. Mammootty played supporting roles in most of the films released during the year. He had 23 of his films released during the year.

=== 1983–1986: Experimentation and breakthrough ===
In 1983, he started to transition into leading roles. Balu Kiriyath experimented with Mammootty by casting him as the lead in the comedy drama &quot;Visa,&quot; which was declared a hit at the box office. In his next film, &quot;Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu,&quot; directed by P. G. Vishwambaran, he played the role of a libertine lawyer who takes up the case of a female physician who is charged with medical negligence. The film became a major commercial success, running for 250 days in theatres. A critic of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; wrote, &quot;Seema, as Dr. Bala gives a stand out performance, being particularly impressive in highly emotional sequences. She is matched in acting by Mammootty, who is advocate Jayamohan.&quot; In 2017, &quot;The Times of India&quot; described Mammootty&#x27;s role as one of the &quot;astounding advocate roles he has given life to&quot;. &quot;Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu&quot; is credited with solidifying Mammootty&#x27;s status as a leading man. He then starred in Vishwambaran&#x27;s &quot;Pinnilavu,&quot; a film about a fight of ethics between a father and son. A multi starrer, it was also a commercial success, running for 150 days in theatres. He then appeared in a supporting role in K. G. George&#x27;s controversial classic &quot;Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback.&quot; In the film, Mammootty plays the role of a film superstar, a character modelled after Prem Nazir. On 15 May 1983, Sreedhar Pillai of &quot;India Today&quot; wrote, &quot;Mammootty, the current rage of the Malayalam screen, successfully apes the mannerisms of fellow actor Prem Nazir in his Prem Sagar role.&quot;

He then starred as an antihero in P. Padmarajan&#x27;s classic &quot;Koodevide.&quot; In the film, he plays the role of a jealous and possessive lover of a boarding school teacher. The film was a major commercial success. Anandu Suresh of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; wrote, &quot;Mammootty here adeptly navigated a range of emotions. But particularly impressive was his depiction of Thomas’ jealousy, triggered by Alice’s close bond with one of her students, a mother-son-like one which Thomas misconstrues as romantic. Mammootty skillfully showcased Thomas’ descent into villainy, capturing his character’s sinister demeanour and willingness to go the extra mile to win Alice’s affection just for himself.&quot; His pairing with Suhasini was very successful and was continued in films like &quot;Ente Upasana&quot; (1984). &quot;Koodevide&quot; was also selected for screening in that year&#x27;s Indian Panorama. It also won the Kerala State Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value. He then collaborated with director Joshiy for the first time for &quot;Aa Raathri.&quot; Despite mixed critical response, it was a commercial success. It had a very successful soundtrack, credited with launching Ilaiyaraaja&#x27;s Malayalam film career. Critics consider &quot;Aa Rathri&quot; to be a trendsetter. It is regarded to be the first of the Kutty Petty films, tear-jerker family-drama tragedy of the 1980s. Films of this genre typically featured a happy family in the beginning, with a well-placed husband-cum-father, a young mother and a girl child of the age of 3 or 4. In the end, the family gets into a whirlpool of relationship problems. Other notable releases of the year were supporting roles in Fazil&#x27;s &quot;Eettillam&quot; and I. V. Sasi&#x27;s political &quot;Iniyenkilum.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Iniyenkilum&quot; for &quot;India Today&quot;, Sreedhar Pillai wrote, &quot;Mammootty easily outshines everyone else as the villainous politician.&quot;

In 1984, he starred as the smuggler Tharadas in I. V. Sasi&#x27;s &quot;Athirathram.&quot; The film achieved considerable commercial success and the character of Tharadas gained a cult following among the youth. Mammootty, who was considered a bankable leading actor was propelled to superstardom with the success of the film. Owing to the popularity of the character, it was reprised by Mammootty in &quot;Balram vs Tharadas&quot; (2006). He then starred in I. V. Sasi&#x27;s &quot;Kanamarayathu,&quot; an adaptation of the 1912 novel Daddy-Long-Legs by Jean Webster. In the film he plays the role of the sole successor of a rich business empire who falls for an orphan girl younger than him. &quot;Kanamarayathu&quot; explores the concept of relationships between couples with a large disparity in their ages, which challenged Indian social mores. Upon release the film received critical acclaim and became a commercial success. For his performance as Roy Varghese, Mammootty won his first Kerala Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor. The film has over the years accumulated a cult following and is now considered a classic in Malayalam cinema. He then starred as a police officer in Bharathan&#x27;s &quot;Ithiri Poove Chuvannapoove.&quot; The film explores the relationship between a police officer and his younger brother, who becomes a Naxalite. It was a critical success and had a successful soundtrack.

He then appeared in a supporting role in the art house film, &quot;Akkare&quot;. In the film he portrays a non resident Malayali. The film is a satirical take on the obsession, especially of the middle class of other&#x27;s lifestyle. He then starred as a vengeful fisherman back from prison in I. V. Sasi&#x27;s &quot;Adiyozhukkukal.&quot; The film was a commercial and critical success. Mammootty won his first Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor and his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Malayalam for his performance as Karunan. Mammootty&#x27;s performance in the film is often considered one of the best in his early career. The film was produced by Casino Productions, a production company owned by Century Kochumon, Mohanlal, I. V. Sasi, and Mammootty. He also starred in I. V. Sasi&#x27;s &quot;Aalkkoottathil Thaniye,&quot; a box office hit. In 1988, film scholar Vasanthi Shankaranarayanan wrote, &quot;&quot;Aalkkottathil Thaniye&quot; shows the changing image of woman in contemporary Malayalam cinema. From weak and enslaved to strong and independent.&quot; &quot;Aalkkottathil Thaniye&quot;, the screenplay was released as a book by DC Books in 2009. That year he also starred in several Kutty Petty films that received negative critical reviews but were successful at the box office, notable of which were &quot;Sandarbham, Koottinilamkili&quot; and &quot;Chakkarayumma.&quot; The former of which was a major box office hit, running for 150 days in theatres. It was one of the highest grossing films of the year. The genre had now become synonymous with Mammootty, being renamed the Mammootty-Kutty-Petty film.

The following year, he starred in Padmarajan&#x27;s &quot;Thinkalaazhcha Nalla Divasam,&quot; based on the radio drama &quot;Ammaykku Vendi&quot; by Sajini Pavithran&quot;,&quot; in which he plays the role of a man who wants to sell his ancestral house and put his mother in an old age home. The film explores the layers of family relationship in a rural setting threatened by urban culture and explains how the imminent breakdown of the joint family is prevented by a death. Upon release, the film was critically acclaimed, winning the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam that year. He then starred in I. V. Sasi&#x27;s &quot;Anubandham,&quot; scripted by M. T. Vasudevan Nair, the film was released to widespread critical acclaim, winning four Kerala State Film Awards that year.

The challenge was created by Abdul Manaf, an entrepreneur, and Imthias Kadeer, a travel photographer. Mammootty challenged Mohanlal and Shah Rukh Khan to take up the challenge. Kazhcha, organised by Mammootty Fans Welfare Association and Mammootty Times, in association with Little Flower Hospital and Research Centre and the Eye Bank Association of Kerala, is a venture to extend free eye care and treatment. One of the major activities related to this is the distribution of free spectacles to children. A special fund received from the office of the President of India will be utilised for this purpose. Free eye camps will also be conducted at various places in connection with this project.

== Media image and artistry ==

Unlike other Indian film industries, which saw the emergence of superstars that commanded a great degree of fame and stardom post-Indian independence, Malayalam cinema historically focused on stories that dealt with the lives of ordinary people, and did not generally have superstars, with the possible exception of Prem Nazir. This changed in the 1980s with the growing popularity of Mammootty and Mohanlal. Sreedhar Pillai of &quot;India Today&quot; wrote in December 1988, &quot;So impregnable is their hold over the industry today that new films are launched only if they have the time.&quot;

In 2005, films starring Mammootty, Mohanlal and Dileep accounted for 97 per cent of the box office revenue of Malayalam cinema. During the 2006 IIFA Awards ceremony held at Dubai, he openly criticised the organizers of the IIFA Awards for completely ignoring South Indian film by stating that the Bollywood film industry should stand up to competition from the South Indian film industry before calling itself international.

In 2013, his role in &quot;Mathilukal&quot; was listed among the &quot;25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema&quot; by &quot;Forbes India&quot; on the occasion of celebrating 100 years of Indian Cinema.

Mammootty was appointed as the brand ambassador of the Thrissur-based South Indian Bank on 16 October 2006. He was also featured as the brand ambassador for Kerala Volleyball League.

<text>Gopi (, ) or Gopika in Hinduism are commonly referred to the group of milkmaids of Braj. They are regarded as the consorts and devotees of Krishna and are venerated for their unconditional love and devotion (&quot;Bhakti&quot;) to him as described in &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; and other Puranic literature. Gopis are often considered as the expansion of Radha, the chief consort of Krishna. The Raslila of gopis with Krishna has inspired various traditional performance art forms and literatures.

According to Indian philosopher Jiva Goswami, gopis are considered as the eternal beloved and manifestations of the internal spiritual potency of Krishna. Among the gopis, Radha is the chief gopi and is the personification of the bliss potency (&quot;hladini shakti&quot;) of Krishna. She alone manifests the stage of &quot;mahabhava,&quot; or supreme love for Krishna, and holds a place of particularly high reverence and importance in a number of religious traditions.

== Etymology ==
Gopi (गोपी) is a Sanskrit word originating from the word Gopa. In Hinduism, the name &quot;Gopika&quot; or &quot;Gopi&quot; is especially used to refer the milkmaids of Braj region. The word Gopis in the plural refers to the group of cowherd women who possess devotion toward Krishna. When it is used in the singular (&quot;Gopi&quot;), it generally refers to Radha, who was the Krishna&#x27;s favourite gopi.

==Prominent gopis==
The prominent &quot;gopis&quot; of Vrindavan are total 108 in numbers. They share the eternal intimate friendship with Radha Krishna. No one can equal or exceed the love they bear for the divine couple. Out of 108 gopis, the primary eight gopis are considered as the foremost of Krishna&#x27;s devotees after goddess Radharani who is considered as the chief of gopis. Their names are as follows: 
* Radha (Chief gopi, Krishna&#x27;s favourite)
*Lalita 
* Vishakha 
* Champakalata 
* Chitra 
* Tungavidya 
* Indulekha 
* Rangadevi 
* Sudevi 
All the eight primary gopis are together called as the Ashtasakhis (eight friends) of Radha and Krishna.

==Unconditional love==

According to Hindu Vaishnava theology, the stories concerning the gopis are said to exemplify &quot;Suddha-bhakti&quot; which is described as &#x27;the highest form of unconditional love for God (Krishna). Their spontaneous and unwavering devotion is described in depth in the later chapters of the Bhagavata Purana, within Krishna&#x27;s Vrindavan pastimes and also in the stories of the sage Uddhava. 

For Vaishnava traditions, the most important representation of the gopis&#x27; love and devotion for Krishna is a story in the Bhagavata Purana (10.29-33) by the name of &quot;Rasa Lila Panchadhyaya&quot;, which translates as &quot;the five chapters on the story of the rasa dance&quot;. The &quot;bhakti&quot; or devotion that the gopis express in this story is believed by the Chaitanya tradition to exemplify the highest form of &quot;bhakti&quot;. In the story, Krishna&#x27;s flute music attracts the gopis&#x27; attention, making them leave behind their families and homes so that they can enjoy devotion of Krishna:Upon hearing that sweet music,

their passion for him swelling,

The young women of Braj whose 

minds were captured by Krishna,

Unaware of one another,

ran off toward the place 

Where their beloved was waiting,

with their earrings swinging wildly (Bhagavata Purana 10.29.4)

<text>Palappurathu Keshavan Surendranatha Thilakan (15 July 1935 – 24 September 2012) was an Indian film and stage actor who appeared in over 200 Malayalam films. Thilakan was known for his elaborate method acting, realistic and spontaneous appearances and is considered to be one of the greatest actors in Indian Cinema.

== Early life ==
Thilakan was the second of the six children of P. T. S. Keshavan of the Palappurathu house (1904–1972) and Devayani Amma (1912–2010). Thilakan was born in Edayaranmula, Aranmula Panchayat in the present-day Pathanamthitta district of Kerala. He had his primary education from Asan Pallikoodam, Manikkal and St. Louis Catholic School, Nalamvayal, M. D. Seminary School Kottayam and Sree Narayana College, Kollam.He served in military while Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime minister before starting his acting career. Thilakan lived in Aranmula until he started acting in films for which he moved to Trivandrum.

Thilakan started his full-time career in acting after leaving college in the year 1956. During this period he and several friends formed a drama troupe called the &quot;Mundakayam Nataka Samithy&quot; in Mundakayam, where his father was working as an estate supervisor. He worked with the Kerala People&#x27;s Arts Club till 1966, followed by stints in Kalidasa Kalakendram, Changanacherry Geetha, and P. J. Antony&#x27;s troupe. He also performed in several radio plays presented by All India Radio.

==Career==
Thilakan began his career in cinema with a role in the P. J. Antony-directed Malayalam movie &quot;Periyar&quot; (1973). He then worked in &quot;Gandharvakshetram&quot; and &quot;Ulkadal&quot; (1979). His first role as a lead character was as Kallu Varkey, a drunkard in &quot;Kolangal&quot; (1981). Thilakan was awarded his first Kerala State Film Awards in 1982 for his role in &quot;Yavanika&quot;. He also won Kerala State Award for supporting actor in &quot;Yathra&quot; which also starred Mammootty.

In 1988, he received the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Rithubhedam,&quot; and again in 1994. In 1998, he won State awards for &quot;Santhanagopalam&quot; and &quot;Gamanam&quot;. He was strongly favored to get another National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in the movie &quot;Perumthachan,&quot; but the award was given to Amitabh Bachchan over Thilakan amidst suspicions of strong lobbying, as Amitabh had announced his retirement earlier that year. The film &quot;Kireedam&quot; was a milestone in Thilakan&#x27;s career; in this film, he portrayed a helpless policeman silently watching the fate of his son, played by Mohanlal, who was corrupted by society&#x27;s influences. In 1989 he performed in Mammootty starrer &quot;Mrugya&quot;, in which his role of a Reverend Father Panangodan was well appreciated by critics and won him many accolades. In the 1990s Thilakan was part of many Mammootty and Mohanlal evergreen hit films. In 1987, he was appreciated for his role in &quot;Thaniyavarthanam&quot; where he portrayed a man who is the head of a family where his nephew played by Mammootty becomes lunatic due to superstition and lack of awareness of mental health. He was awarded the Second Best Actor for &quot;Thaniyavarthanam&quot;. In the same year, he also played the comic role of &quot;Ananthan Nambiar&quot; in the cult-classic comedy movie &quot;Nadodikkattu&quot;, from which several of Thilakan&#x27;s lines became very popular. He also starred in the National award winning movie &quot;Mathilukal&quot;, which was directed by Adoor Gopalakrishnan in which he played the role of a warden of the jail who develops a rapport with the prisoner Vaikom Muhammad Basheer (Mammootty). In 1993, he continued his role as the father of Sethu Madhavan (Mohanlal) in the movie &quot;Chenkol&quot;. Like its prequel &quot;Kireedam&quot;, this movie also fared well both commercially and critically. His role as a retired mathematics teacher and headmaster C.P Chacko alias Kaduva Chacko, father of Thomas Chacko alias Aadu Thoma (Mohanlal), in the 1995 blockbuster movie &quot;Spadikam&quot; was well appreciated by critics and audiences alike. In 1998, he played the role of Dileep&#x27;s father in the superhit &quot;Meenathil Thalikettu&quot;, and in his subsequent release he donned the role of a villain in the Kunchako Boban starrer &quot;Mayilpeelikavu&quot;. In the same year, he was also seen in &quot;Chinthavishtayaya Shyamala&quot;. Other notable films Thilakan has acted in include &quot;Yathra&quot;, &quot;Mukthi&quot;, &quot;Kauravar&quot;, &quot;Moonnam Pakkam&quot;, &quot;Kilukkam&quot;, &quot;Namukku Parkkan Munthiri Thoppukal&quot;, &quot;Mookkilla Rajyathu&quot;, &quot;Randam Bhavam&quot;, &quot;Kaattu Kuthira&quot; and &quot;Yavanika&quot;.

He has also acted in other South Indian languages, such as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.

Thilakan has portrayed a range of characters; however, his most well-known role is that of the father of Mohanlal, portraying a father-son duo. Movies where he donned this role include &quot;Kireedam&quot;, &quot;Spadikam&quot;, &quot;Narasimham&quot;, &quot;Evidam Swargamanu&quot;, &quot;Pavithram&quot; and &quot;Chenkol&quot;. He has also played father roles to other popular actors, including with Mammootty in &quot;Sangham&quot;, &quot;The Truth&quot;, &quot;Oliyampukal&quot;, &quot;No. 1 Snehatheeram Bangalore North&quot; and &quot;Pallavur Devanarayanan&quot;, with Jayaram in &quot;Veendum Chila Veettu Karyangal&quot; and &quot;Sandesam&quot;, with Kunchacko Boban in &quot;Aniyathi Pravu&quot;, with Dileep in &quot;Punjabi House&quot; and &quot;Meenathil Thalikettu&quot; and with Prithviraj in &quot;Sathyam&quot;. He has also played a number of antagonists, such as in &quot;Randam Bhavam&quot;, &quot;Karma&quot; and &quot;Kaalal Pada&quot;.

He is also remembered for the role of comic underworld don &quot;Damodarjj&quot; in Sanmanassullavarkku Samadhanam. Thilakan played lead roles in &quot;Ekantham&quot;, &quot;Perumthachan&quot;, &quot;Santhanagopalam&quot;, &quot;Kaattukuthira&quot;, &quot;My Dear Muthachan&quot;, &quot;Mukhamudra&quot; (double role), etc.

==Controversies==

=== National Film Award ===
Thilakan, in an interview, claimed that the then jury chairman Ashok Kumar was keen on giving him the 1991 National Film Award for Best Actor for &quot;Perumthachan&quot; but that a Congress leader wanted the award to be given to Amitabh Bachchan to woo him back to their party.

=== FEFKA ===
In February 2010, it was reported that the producer of the movie &quot;Christian Brothers&quot; excluded Thilakan from the film at the request of the FEFKA, the predominant film technicians association. Thilakan had been earlier signed for a role in the film. The exclusion was reportedly due to Thilakan acting in a film by director Vinayan, who till recently headed the rival association MACTA. On 3 February 2010, Thilakan publicly protested against the unofficial ban enforced on him by FEFKA and blamed FEFKA for engineering the ban. The Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) issued a show cause notice to Thilakan for bringing the issue into the public domain. Thilakan accused AMMA, of which he too is a member. On 20 February 2010 the CPI&#x27;s trade union wing, AITUC, came out openly in support of Thilakan, while a senior party leader and Rajya Sabha member K. E. Ismail expressed reservations about political involvement in the issue.

Thilakan was originally cast to play a role in a UAE-Indian co-production film &quot;Dam 999&quot;. He was later replaced following a notice from FEFKA stating that the association would boycott the film if Thilakan were to act. Sohan, the director, was forced to seek a substitute for Thilakan when it &quot;came to the point that shooting might be disrupted.&quot; Eventually, Rajit Kapur was cast instead of Thilakan. Some reports contended that Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) also had intervened in Thilakan&#x27;s replacement. In response, Thilakan and his supporters orchestrated a march near the shooting location of the film in Alappuzha.

==Personal life==

=== Relationships ===
Thilakan&#x27;s first partner was actress Santha with whom he appeared in several productions. Thilakan and Santha have three sons, Shaji, Shammi &amp; Shobhi. Later, he had a second partner, his co-artist Sarojam with whom he had a son, Shibu Thilakan, and two daughters Dr. Sonia Thilakan and Sophia Ajith.

His grandson Abhimanyu made his debut in &quot;Marco&quot; (2024) starring &quot; Unni Mukundan&quot;.

=== Views ===
Thilakan was an atheist throughout his life, and was a supporter of Communist Party. He was a member of many drama troupes which actively promoted Communism in Kerala. When he died, his dead body was draped with Communist flag.
==Death==
For a long time, Thilakan dealt with numerous health issues like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. He was hospitalized multiple times due to these problems. Finally, he was admitted to Jubilee Mission Hospital in Thrissur on 1 August 2012 after he collapsed during the shooting of the film &quot;Scene Onnu Nammude Veedu&quot;. He was then shifted to KIMS Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, and was in critical condition after suffering two heart attacks. Besides having cardiac problems, Thilakan was suffering from pneumonia. He was put on a ventilator and died on 24 September 2012. He was cremated with full state honours.

<text>John Frederick Clute (born 12 September 1940) is a Canadian-born author and critic specializing in science fiction and fantasy literature who has lived in both England and the United States since 1969. He has been described as &quot;an integral part of science fiction&#x27;s history&quot; and &quot;perhaps the foremost reader-critic of science fiction in our time, and one of the best the genre has ever known.&quot; He was one of eight people who founded the English magazine &quot;Interzone&quot; in 1982 (the others included Malcolm Edwards, Colin Greenland, Roz Kaveney, and David Pringle).

Clute&#x27;s articles on speculative fiction have appeared in various publications since the 1960s. He is a co-editor of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; (with Peter Nicholls) and of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; (with John Grant), as well as the author of &quot;The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,&quot; all of which won Hugo Awards for Best Related Work (a category for nonfiction). He earned the Pilgrim Award, bestowed by the Science Fiction Research Association for Lifetime Achievement in the field of science fiction scholarship, in 1994. Clute is also author of the collections of reviews and essays &quot;Strokes&quot;; &quot;Look at the Evidence: Essays and Reviews&quot;; &quot;Scores&quot;; &quot;Canary Fever&quot;; and &quot;Pardon This Intrusion.&quot; His 2001 novel &quot;Appleseed,&quot; a space opera, was noted for its &quot;combination of ideational fecundity and combustible language&quot; and was selected as a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book for 2002. 

In 2006, Clute published the essay collection &quot;The Darkening Garden: A Short Lexicon of Horror.&quot; The third edition of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; (with David Langford and Peter Nicholls) was released online as a beta text in October 2011 and has since been greatly expanded; it won the Hugo Award for Best Related Work in 2012. The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;″s statistics page reported that, as of 24 March 2017, Clute had authored the great majority of articles: 6,421 solo and 1,219 in collaboration, totalling over 2,408,000 words (more than double, in all cases, those of the second-most prolific contributor, David Langford). The majority of these are Author entries, but there are also some Media entries, notably that for &quot;Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens.&quot; 

Clute was a Guest of Honour at Loncon 3, the 72nd World Science Fiction Convention, from 14 to 18 August 2014.

==Personal life==

Raised in Canada, Clute lived in the United States from 1956 until 1964. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at New York University in 1962 while living with writer and artist Pamela Zoline.

Clute married artist Judith Clute in 1964. He has been the partner of Elizabeth Hand since 1996.

==Career==

Clute&#x27;s first professional publication was a long science-fictional poem entitled &quot;Carcajou Lament&quot;, which appeared in &quot;TriQuarterly&quot; in 1959. His first short story (one of his few) was &quot;A Man Must Die&quot;, which appeared in &quot;New Worlds&quot; in 1966.

In 1960, he served as Associate Editor of &quot;Collage,&quot; a Chicago-based &quot;slick&quot; magazine which ran only two issues; it published early work by Harlan Ellison and R. A. Lafferty. During the 1960s and 70s he appeared chiefly in NEW WORLDS, becoming an important contributor of essays and reviews.

In 1977, Clute published his first novel, &quot;The Disinheriting Party&quot; (Allison &amp; Busby). Though not explicitly a fantasy, this story of a dysfunctional family has a fantasy feel, rather like much postmodern literature. Reviewer Ifdary Bailey wrote that this &quot;everyday story of family life in a revenge tragedy, of relations and revelations, hidden identities and loss of identity, incest and inheritance, all brooded over by the Father Who Will Not Die, carries itself forward swiftly and surely to its conclusion with strength and control.&quot;

Clute&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Appleseed&quot; (2001), is the story of trader Nathanael Freer, who pilots an AI-helmed starship named &quot;Tile Dance&quot; en route to the planet Eolhxir to deliver a shipment of nanotechnological devices. Freer meets a man calling himself Johnny Appleseed, who rejoins Freer with his lost lover, Ferocity Monthly-Niece. Meanwhile, a terrifying, data-destroying &quot;plaque&quot; is threatening the galaxy&#x27;s civilizations. Clute has proposed it as the first novel in a trilogy. Science fiction and fantasy author Paul Di Filippo called it &quot;a space opera for the 21st century.&quot; Keith Brooke suggested that Clute himself would be the best reviewer for this multilayered novel.

===Reviewing===

Clute&#x27;s first significant science fiction reviews appeared in the late 1960s in &quot;New Worlds&quot;. He has reviewed fiction and nonfiction in such periodicals as &quot;Interzone&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Omni&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and elsewhere; some of these writings appeared in his early collection, &quot;Strokes&quot;.

Though Clute is chiefly known for his critiques of fiction, he has also reviewed other modes, such as film. His language can be as blunt and amusing as it is honest; some review columns have such titles as &quot;Nonsense is what good adventure SF makes silk purses out of&quot;, &quot;Prometheus Emphysema&quot;, &quot;An empty bottle. An empty mind. An empty book&quot;, &quot;Book of the Mouth&quot;, and &quot;Mage Sh*t&quot;.

===Excessive candour===

Clute has issued a polemic he calls the &quot;Protocol of Excessive Candour&quot;, which argues that reviewers of science fiction and fantasy must not pull punches because of friendship:

His review column of this name began at &quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot; and moved to &quot;Sci-Fi Wire.&quot;

===Writing style===

Contributing the essay on himself for &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,&quot; Clute wrote that his &quot;criticism, despite some curiously flamboyant obscurities, remains essentially practical; it has appeared mostly in the form of reviews, some of considerable length.&quot; He told an interviewer,

Matthew Davis has written, &quot;Clute stands out, not just because of the depth and breadth of his knowledge, but also for the individuality of his writing; even the most formal sentence plucked from one of his scholastic works is readily identifiable due to his individual judgement and style.&quot; SF Site&#x27;s Rich Horton agreed that Clute is &quot;a man known first and foremost as a critic, and moreover a man known for his formidable intelligence and vocabulary, and his enjoyment in wielding both ... anyone familiar with John Clute&#x27;s critical work will know that his prose is not simple, though it is precise and at its best exhilarating.&quot;

Author Henry Wessells, in a review of &quot;The Darkening Garden,&quot; wrote:

==Critical reception==

Hilary Bailey, reviewing &quot;The Disinheriting Party,&quot; wrote,

Describing Clute&#x27;s criticism, Davis has written,

In a review of &quot;Look at the Evidence,&quot; Douglas Barbour exhorts the reader, &quot;Find this book! You won&#x27;t be sorry!&quot; and admires

Clute had gained a reputation as a critic before his second novel appeared, and some reviewers admitted that they found it &quot;difficult&quot; to read; others found it &quot;intimidating&quot; to review, as though trying carried the jeopardy of being found failing. Paul Di Filippo was excited by &quot;Appleseed,&quot; writing,

Some reviewers were of two minds:

John C. Snider, similarly, suggested &quot;Future Classic or Total Gibberish?&quot;:

and Keith Brooke wrote, &quot;This is not an &quot;over&quot;-written novel, it&#x27;s an &quot;intensely&quot;-written one. At its best it&#x27;s a fantastically effective technique: a spangly word-portrait that has a real sense of wonder bursting off every page. At its worst, it gets in the way, blinding the reader to Clute&#x27;s wildly detailed imaginings.&quot;

<text>Maskerade is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the eighteenth book in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. The witches Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg visit the Ankh-Morpork Opera House to find Agnes Nitt, a girl from Lancre, and get caught up in a story similar to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Agnes Nitt leaves Lancre to seek a career at the Opera House in Ankh-Morpork, which has recently been purchased by Seldom Bucket, formerly a cheesemonger. When Granny Weatherwax realizes Nanny Ogg has written an immensely popular &quot;cookbook&quot; but has not been paid by the publisher (and that the nom de plume of &#x27;A Lancre Witch&#x27; may lead people to believe that she rather than Nanny wrote it), the witches leave for Ankh-Morpork to collect the money. They also hope to recruit Agnes into their coven, to replace Magrat Garlick who left the coven when she became Queen of Lancre (in &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;). This has the side benefit of distracting Granny from becoming obsessive and self-centred, or so Nanny believes to her great relief. En route, they meet Henry Slugg, an Ankh-Morporkian opera singer who adopted a Brindisian persona of Enrico Basilica to further his career but yearns for Ankh-Morporkian cuisine after years of Brindisian pasta, squid and tomato sauce; and Granny makes a deal with Death for him not to claim the fatally-ill son of an innkeeper.

Agnes Nitt is chosen as a member of the chorus, where she meets Christine, a more popular but less talented girl whose father lent Bucket large sums of money to purchase the Opera House. The Opera Ghost, who has long haunted the opera house without much incident, begins to commit seemingly random murders staged as &quot;accidents&quot;, and also requests that Christine be given lead roles in several upcoming productions. Due to her incredibly powerful, versatile and possibly magical voice, Agnes is asked to sing the parts from the background, unbeknownst to Christine or the audience. After swapping rooms with Christine, Agnes begins receiving late-night training from the Opera Ghost originally intended for Christine.

Having discovered the problems at the Opera House and also having coerced the publisher to pay Nanny richly for her book, the witches investigate the mystery, with Granny posing as a rich patron (using Nanny&#x27;s royalties), Nanny insinuating herself into the opera house staff, and Nanny&#x27;s cat Greebo being transmogrified into human form (as during &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;) to pose as Granny&#x27;s companion. Agnes unmasks Walter Plinge, the janitor, as the ghost, though as he is seemingly harmless, the others are unconvinced. Andre, another employee, is suspected, but he turns out to be a Cable Street Particular. Granny determines that the finances of the Opera House, which are a complete mess, have been made so intentionally in order to hide the fact that money is being stolen, with the murders being used either as a distraction or to cover up the evidence.

It is finally revealed that two people had been masquerading as the ghost. The original (and harmless) ghost, Walter Plinge, was being psychologically manipulated and blackmailed by the second ghost, Mr Salzella (Director of Music at the Opera House), who assumed the identity to commit the murders and theft, and frame Walter if he ever came close to being caught. With the witches&#x27; help, Walter is able to overcome his fears and help defeat Salzella, who is killed by believing that the fencing staged in opera is actual lethal swordplay, dying despite not actually being injured, although not before delivering a lengthy monologue about his hatred of opera. Walter then goes on to become the new Director of Music, integrating his own music into the opera, turning them into musicals. Slugg, decidedly abandoning his Enrico Basilica persona after being assaulted and concussed by Salzella, reunites with Angeline Lawsy, his childhood sweetheart, and is introduced to his long-lost son Henry Lawsy. Agnes, after realising that she does not fit in with the environment of the opera, returns to Lancre to learn how to be a witch from Granny and to serve as the third member of the Lancre Coven.

<text>Mildred Trouillot-Aristide (born 1963) is an American lawyer who married Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the former President of Haïti, in 1996.

Mildred Trouillot grew up in the Bronx. Both her father, Emile, and mother, Carmelle, were natives of Haïti. He left Haïti in 1958, she in 1960. They found work in New York City, where Emile worked in a steel factory. Carmelle worked as a laboratory technician.

Mildred graduated from St. Barnabas High School, City College of New York, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School. She practiced commercial litigation for the Manhattan law firm of Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn, and Berman. She met Aristide at a lecture he gave in 1992. In 1994, she went to work for Aristide&#x27;s government in exile in Washington, D.C. as a speechwriter, as well as doing legal work.

They married on January 20, 1996, in a simple ceremony in Port-au-Prince. It was a controversial marriage in Haïti. Aristide was elected president while he was a Catholic priest, and had given up the priesthood by the time he married Mildred.

The couple has two daughters, Christine Aristide, born in November 1996, and Michaelle Aristide, born in 1998.

<text>Control is the third studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A&amp;M Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco, and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&amp;B. The distinctive triplet swing beat utilized on the record is also considered to be a precursor to the new jack swing genre. The album became Jackson&#x27;s commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with &quot;Control&quot; becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.

Containing autobiographical themes, a majority of the album&#x27;s lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&amp;M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly Black women.

Following its release, &quot;Control&quot; became Jackson&#x27;s first album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart in the United States and five of its commercial singles—&quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;, &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Control&quot;, &quot;When I Think of You&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile&quot;—peaked within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, making Jackson the first female artist to have five top five hits from one album on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; &quot;When I Think of You&quot; became the singer&#x27;s first number one hit. &quot;Control&quot; also set a record for the longest continuous run of charting singles on the Hot 100, at 65 consecutive weeks. Music videos created to promote the album&#x27;s singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV&#x27;s evolving demographics. The album remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for over two years. It has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.

&quot;Control&quot; went on to receive several accolades, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and winning Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987. It is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, in addition to being included in several publications &quot;best of&quot; album lists. In 2016, it was selected for exhibition in the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC).

== Background ==
Joseph Jackson, patriarch of the Jackson family of musicians, was known for managing the careers of all nine of his children – most notably, the successful career of The Jackson 5. After arranging a recording contract with A&amp;M in 1982 for a then 15 year old Janet, he oversaw the entire production of her debut album, &quot;Janet Jackson&quot;, and its follow up, &quot;Dream Street&quot; (1984); the latter of which was written and produced by her brothers Marlon and Michael, and Jesse Johnson. Best known as a television actress, she was initially reluctant to begin a recording career. She said, &quot;I was coming off of a TV show that I absolutely hated doing, &quot;Fame&quot;. I didn&#x27;t want to do [the first record, &quot;Janet Jackson&quot;]. I wanted to go to college. But I did it for my father ...&quot; and elaborated that she was often in conflict with her producers. Amidst her professional struggles, she rebelled against her family&#x27;s wishes by marrying James DeBarge of the family recording group DeBarge in 1984. The Jacksons disapproved of the relationship, citing DeBarge&#x27;s immaturity and substance abuse. Jackson left her husband in January 1985 and was granted an annulment later that year.

Jackson subsequently fired her father as her manager and employed John McClain, then A&amp;M Records&#x27; senior vice president of artists and repertoire and general manager. Commenting on the decision, she stated, &quot;I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn&#x27;t want to work with him again.&quot; Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter&#x27;s career out from under him, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve worked hard for my family. The problem comes, though, when others come in behind you and try to steal them away. The wheels have already been set for Janet Jackson. Anyone who jumps on now will be getting a free ride.&quot; McClain responded by saying &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father.&quot; He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting/production duo of James &quot;Jimmy Jam&quot; Harris III and Terry Lewis, former Prince associates and ex-members of The Time.

== Composition and production ==
When Jam and Lewis agreed to produce Jackson&#x27;s third studio album, they wanted to appeal primarily to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, &quot;We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America ... we were going for &quot;the&quot; black album of all time.&quot; Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too &quot;rambunctious&quot;. The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album&#x27;s content. Jam and Lewis recalled that to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, &quot;We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, what she wanted to say, where she wanted to be, what she wanted to be. We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that.&quot;

For the song &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;, which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis&#x27;s own records, the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson&#x27;s feelings about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. The song was chosen as the lead single for &quot;Control&quot;, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson&#x27;s outlook on life. &quot;Nasty&quot;, which in Jackson&#x27;s opinion was the most innovative song on the album, was inspired by her experience with street harassment in Minneapolis by a group of men outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of &quot;Control&quot;. She recalled, &quot;They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That&#x27;s how songs like &#x27;Nasty&#x27; and &#x27;What Have You Done for Me Lately&#x27; were born, out of a sense of self-defense.&quot; Jimmy Jam wrote and played the keyboard arrangement, with Jackson playing the accompaniment. Background vocals were sung by Jackson, Jam and Lewis. The distinctive triplet swing beat of the song was developed by Jam on an Ensoniq Mirage keyboard. &quot;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile&quot; was centered on safe sex and abstinence, a subject of significant social commentary at the time. Jam commented that it is common practice for songwriters to use current events as a means of inspiration for lyrics and that the AIDS pandemic had raised awareness about sexually transmitted diseases. He commented, &quot;The theme of the song (&#x27;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile&#x27;) was Janet&#x27;s idea. She&#x27;s not a preachy person. She&#x27;s not telling people how to live their lives. All she&#x27;s doing is offering an opinion.&quot;

Although Joseph Jackson initially demanded that his daughter&#x27;s new album be recorded in Los Angeles so that he could keep an eye out for her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, &quot;far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers.&quot; Jam stated, &quot;We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson&#x27;s people hanging around making suggestions.&quot; Jackson relocated to Minneapolis in order to record the album, where it was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. &quot;There&#x27;s a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the &quot;Control&quot; album,&quot; Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.

Jam and Lewis were the primary instrumentalists for the recording, including percussion, piano, drums, and also provided background vocals. Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed the album was a prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology, stating &quot;... technology has altered the form, shape, scale and even the meaning of popular music ... The album wasn&#x27;t created by a studio band, as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s father disapproved of the new material and image of &quot;Control&quot;, claiming it would never sell. In a cover story for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine titled &quot;Damn It, Janet: The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson,&quot; Joseph was reported saying &quot;[i]f Janet listens to me, she&#x27;ll be as big as Michael.&quot; She and McClain disregarded his objections. Commenting on the final product, Jackson stated: &quot;It&#x27;s aggressive, cocky, very forward. It expresses exactly who I am and how I feel. I&#x27;ve taken control of my own life. This time I&#x27;m gonna do it my way.&quot;

== Album cover ==
Fashion photographer and illustrator Tony Viramontes created the stylized cover for the new album and the singles &quot;Nasty&quot; and &quot;Control&quot;. Jackson said of Viramontes, &quot;He was very creative, and I believe one day his work will be iconic. He was such a joy to work with. I miss him.&quot; Author Dean Rhys Morgan in &quot;Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes&quot; discusses how Jackson was &quot;transformed from a former child star into an assured fashion forward figure with her trendsetting big hair and severe all black ensemble. Until this point, Jackson had been more a reflection than pioneer, more interpreter than innovator. This album was all about Janet and who she wanted to be.&quot; Alexander Fury wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;the artwork created with Eighties illustrator Tony Viramontes for &quot;Control&quot; stands the test of time.&quot;

== Release and promotion ==

Although A&amp;M did not consider a full concert tour to promote Jackson&#x27;s album, the label funded a three-week promotional tour across the United States in 13 cities following its release. In addition to the studio release, a remix album, &quot;&quot;, was released in select countries in November 1987. Jackson&#x27;s lyrical expression has been noted as one of the key elements of the album&#x27;s success. Author Dave Marsh in &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made&quot; (1999) comments: &quot;Certainly, Janet must have written her own lyrics, which went after men—in particular, not very well disguised stand-ins for her father and former husband—more venomously than another guy would have dared. &quot;Control&quot;, the resulting album, was one of the best-sellers of 1986–1987, producing five hit singles.&quot;

Jesus Garber, then-director of A&amp;M&#x27;s black music marketing and promotion, noted that in addition to crossover promotion from black to pop music charts, music video was utilized to launch Jackson into superstardom. Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; credits the release of &quot;Control&quot; as &quot;the birth of Janet the music video star, as six of the nine tracks were turned into popular videos that all but announced her as queen of the production dance number.&quot; Henderson commented that Jackson&#x27;s dancing ability, trained by a then-unknown Paula Abdul, only served to propel her into further stardom. Charlie Minor, then-senior vice president of promotion for A&amp;M stated: &quot;The images completed the image of Janet Jackson with the buyer ... They gave her a face, dance, action identity with the songs, and a visual image of her as a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll star.&quot; Jonathan Cohen of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine commented &quot;[Jackson&#x27;s] accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV, and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader, beat-driven musical mix.&quot; The video for &quot;Nasty&quot; received three nominations for the fifth annual 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, winning Best Choreography for Paula Abdul.

== Commercial performance ==

&quot;Control&quot; debuted at number 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on March 8, 1986, and at number 26 on the Top R&amp;B/Black Albums on March 1, 1986. After twenty weeks, it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Black Albums chart, selling 250,000 copies in a single week, a record for an album by a female artist. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) first certified &quot;Control&quot; gold in April 1986, denoting 500,000 units shipped within the United States. Two months later, in June 1986, the album was RIAA certified platinum, denoting 1 million units shipped. Three years later, &quot;Control&quot; was RIAA certified fivefold platinum in October 1989. By 1990, &quot;Control&quot; had sold 5 million copies in the United States and as of December 2009, the album has sold 496,000 copies in the U.S. since 1991 according to Nielsen SoundScan, which does not count albums sold through clubs like the BMG Music, where she sold 883,000. Combined, it has sold over 6,379,000 copies in the U.S. Since its debut, &quot;Control&quot; has sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;, peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and at number one on the Hot Black Singles chart. The single was certified gold by the RIAA in November 1990. The song was compared favorably to similar recordings of female empowerment released by black women, such as &quot;New Attitude&quot; by Patti LaBelle, &quot;Better Be Good to Me&quot; by Tina Turner, and &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot; by The Eurythmics and Aretha Franklin. Oprah Winfrey commented: &quot;What you&#x27;re seeing in all the areas of arts and entertainment is black women internalizing the idea of black power and pride ... Black women started listening to their inner cues, rather than society or even the black community&#x27;s idea of what they are supposed to be and can be.&quot; &quot;Nasty&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, beat &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot; by one position, peaking at number three on the Hot 100 and at number one on the Hot Black Singles chart. It was certified gold in November 1990. Critic Jon Bream noted &quot;the songwriters have slyly juxtaposed a nasty-sounding groove and the repetition of the word &#x27;nasty&#x27; with a subtle antinasty message.&quot;

&quot;When I Think of You&quot; reached number one on the Hot 100, becoming Jackson&#x27;s first single to top the chart, and was certified gold in November 1990. The album&#x27;s fourth single and title track, &quot;Control&quot;, reached its peak position at number five on the Hot 100 and at number one on the Hot Black Singles chart, later certified gold by the RIAA in November 1990. &quot;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile&quot; reached the number two position on the Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Black Singles chart. Clarence Page of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commented in a similar vein to &quot;Nasty&quot;, the ballad &quot;throw[s] cold water on the passions of young love &#x27;before we go too far&#x27;.&quot; Unlike its predecessors, &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; did not reach within the top five of the Hot 100, instead peaking at number fourteen. It did, however, become Jackson&#x27;s fifth number one single on the Hot Black Singles chart. Each of the album&#x27;s singles excluding &quot;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile&quot; peaked within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Club Play Singles. &quot;Funny How Time Flies (When You&#x27;re Having Fun)&quot; was not released as a commercial single in the United States. It peaked at number 59 on the UK Singles Chart.

== Critical reception ==
Upon its release, the album received universal acclaim from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Rob Hoerburger commented that the &quot;sharp-tongued&quot; Janet Jackson is &quot;more concerned with identity than with playlists&quot;, as &quot;Control&quot; declares she is no longer the Jacksons&#x27; baby sister. Hoerburger expressed the view that tracks such as &quot;Nasty&quot; and &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot; erased the former &quot;pop-ingénue image&quot; of Jackson&#x27;s first two albums, and that &quot;&quot;Control&quot; is a better album than Diana Ross has made in five years and puts Janet in a position similar to the young Donna Summer&#x27;s—unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it.&quot; Steven Ivory of &quot;Billboard&quot; expressed &quot;[v]ocally, Jackson is more aggressive than ever. Indeed, her exhibition of sass and funkiness is certainly more provocative&quot; in comparison to her previous work. &quot;NME&quot; wrote: &quot;Jackson has gone a long way in shaking off the experience of being a shadow Jackson child. She is an artist in her own right.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated &quot;[i]n an era of big-voiced pop-soul divas ... her current hit album, is taut, funky, hard as nails, an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau &quot;scoffed at Janet&#x27;s claims of autonomy&quot;, but applauded Jam &amp; Lewis&#x27;s beats as &quot;their deepest ever&quot; while finding Jackson&#x27;s contribution entertaining enough. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Connie Johnson wrote: &quot;Though still a teen-ager, this singer&#x27;s stance is remarkably nervy and mature. She has a snotty sort of assurance that permeates several cuts, plus the musical muscle to back it up.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes &quot;Control&quot; takes obvious influence from Prince, describing &quot;[t]he album&#x27;s pacing, its clipped vocal lines—even the spoken introduction that starts things off&quot; as pure Minneapolis sound; he adds &quot;[b]ut where the Prince style is usually connected with heavy-breathing come-ons, Miss Jackson is cheerfully standoffish.&quot;

For the 29th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Control&quot; received four nominations: Album of the Year, Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately&quot;, Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Non-Classical Producer of the Year for Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Jam and Lewis won Producer of the Year. The album earned a record-breaking twelve nominations from the American Music Awards, winning four. Jackson also won three Soul Train Music Awards and six &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards.

Later reviews continue to find the album favorable. Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; expressed that the misconception that &quot;Control&quot; is Jackson&#x27;s debut album only confirmed the &quot;quintessential statement on personal and artistic self-actualization&quot; that it set out to accomplish. Henderson claimed critics who judged Jackson harshly for her thin voice &quot;somehow missed the explosive &#x27;gimme a beat&#x27; vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over &quot;Nasty&quot; ... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem &quot;Let&#x27;s Wait Awhile.&quot; However, Henderson also commented that the &quot;Jam-Lewis formula wasn&#x27;t completely infallible&quot; as &quot;You Can Be Mine&quot; and &quot;Funny How Time Flies (When You&#x27;re Having Fun)&quot;, were two of the album&#x27;s least impressive misfires. While William Ruhlmann of AllMusic commented Jackson &quot;came across as an aggressive, independent woman&quot;, he asserts the album&#x27;s true value is the production talents of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Laura Sinagra said that on &quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Jam and Lewis perfected their melodic, full-blown funk attack&quot;, while Jackson &quot;filled each track with a breathy believability&quot; with vocal performances that ranged from yearning to seductive. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked &quot;Control&quot; number 111 on the reboot of its list of &#x27;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&#x27;.

== Accolades ==
== Legacy ==

&quot;Control&quot; is widely considered to be the breakthrough in Jackson&#x27;s career, establishing her independence and dominance in the realm of popular music. In &quot;The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; (1996) author Simon Reynolds wrote that &quot;Janet Jackson became a superstar with the immaculately designed soft-core feminism of &quot;Control&quot;.&quot; &quot;Jet&quot; magazine commented that although the Jackson family&#x27;s musical legacy had given her an opportunity to tap into an international audience, &quot;Control&quot; was the turning point at which &quot;her career took off and she became a bona fide superstar. &quot;Control&quot; showcased Janet as a person who was firmly and finally in control of her own life.&quot; Dennis Hunt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Previously, she had recorded two unsophisticated, kiddie soul albums. If you listened carefully to that kid stuff, there was a grown-up singer there somewhere struggling to get out. [Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis] liberated the real Janet Jackson.&quot;

Lyrically, Jackson&#x27;s album is said to exhibit a &quot;politically driven feminist&quot; message, as stated by Lilly Goren in &quot;You&#x27;ve Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture&quot; (2009). Musically, according to Rickey Vincent, author of &quot;Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One&quot; (1996), Jam and Lewis&#x27;s collaboration with her is said to be one of the high points of the 1980s, as they redefined dance music by mixing a youthful sound with industrial-strength beats. As documented by musicologist Richard J. Ripani, author of &quot;The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm &amp; Blues, 1950–1999&quot; (2006), &quot;Control&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of rhythm and blues and the first album to bridge the gap between R&amp;B and rap music. Its success in both the mainstream R&amp;B and pop music charts &quot;led to the incorporation of many of the stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development.&quot; Furthermore, the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Nasty&quot; has been credited with influencing the new jack swing genre, pioneered by Teddy Riley. Laura Sinagra in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; wrote that the album impacted popular music with a &quot;blockbuster momentum all its own&quot;, while Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; noted &quot;Control&quot; &quot;was every bit the hit machine that her brother&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; was.&quot; Additionally, &quot;Control&quot; made &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 history having the longest continuous run on the Hot 100 with singles from one album at 65 consecutive weeks, breaking her brother Michael&#x27;s record by one week; &quot;Thriller&quot; by comparison charted singles for 64 consecutive weeks. Steve Morse of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; commented: &quot;All things considered, 1986 was a stellar year for the black female vocalist—the best, in fact, since the disco era of a decade back ... Black music crossed over to the pop charts in dramatic fashion, with Whitney Houston, Patti LaBelle and Janet Jackson each having No. 1 albums.&quot;
In addition to stepping out of the Jackson family shadow, &quot;Control&quot; established Jackson as one of the preeminent female artists of popular music, rivaling fellow pop star Madonna, as critics began to acknowledge their influence on the record industry and younger artists. &quot;Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America&quot; (2012) documents that both women redefined house music, repackaging it &quot;as part of a global metropolitan pop aesthetic.&quot; With regard to marketing singles, Paul Grein of &quot;Billboard&quot; reported: &quot;10 or 20 years ago you would have had two singles from an album at the most. Now we&#x27;re in an era where Madonna is on her fifth single from the album &quot;True Blue&quot; and Janet Jackson is on her sixth from the LP &quot;Control&quot;.&quot; Jackson subsequently became the first female artist to produce six top 40 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 from a single album. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Paul Grein wrote a segment titled &quot;The influence of Madonna and Janet Jackson&quot;, reporting Debbie Gibson&#x27;s manager Doug Breitbart claimed &quot;Madonna has brought back a really strong, melodic component to pop music&quot;, while &quot;Teen Beat&quot; editor Maggie Murphy remarked &quot;Janet Jackson may have started this more than anyone else.&quot; Anthony DeCurtis, author of &quot;Present Tense: Rock &amp; Roll and Culture&quot; (1992) wrote that &quot;Madonna and Janet Jackson have produced videos that explore the female gaze,&quot; and described Jackson&#x27;s music video for &quot;Nasty&quot; as feminist theory on film that deconstructs the objectification of women. Laura Sinagra documented that within two years of the release of &quot;Control&quot;, &quot;a new crop of female singers (such as Paula Abdul and Karyn White) were charged with imitating Janet.&quot; Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked: &quot;&quot;Control&quot;—with its quintuple-platinum sales and string of hit singles—established&quot; a then-twenty-year-old Jackson &quot;as one of the most popular recording artists in the world.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the album&#x27;s release as one of the 50 key events in the history of R&amp;B and hip hop.

Upon the 30th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Julian Kimble of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;In hindsight, &quot;Control&quot; is both evolutionary and revolutionary. As Jackson’s first album to land atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it marked professional and personal breakthroughs. Distancing herself from the immense Jackson family shadow, she created one of the most influential projects across contemporary R&amp;B and pop music. And not only was Jackson’s maiden voyage with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis at the forefront of R&amp;B, pop and hip-hop’s intersection, it birthed a novel sound in the process.&quot; Morgan Y. Evans for &quot;PopMatters&quot;&#x27; wrote: &quot;Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Control&quot; is worth reconsidering as, perhaps boldly, one of the top three or four pop records of the &#x27;80s...It is unquestionably the most coherent and powerful full album statement from any female solo pop artist during much of the &#x27;80s, some of Kate Bush&#x27;s more eccentric triumphs that decade notwithstanding.&quot; Kyle Anderson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented: &quot;The videos from &quot;Control&quot; were all over MTV, and Janet established herself as an instantly dominant pop figure talked about in the same sentences as Madonna and her older brother Michael.&quot; MTV&#x27;s Meaghan Garvey asserted &quot;it&#x27;s hard to overstate the significance of &quot;Control&quot;, whether in terms of the pop landscape, the evolution of the music video as a vessel for promotion and expression, or Top 40 feminist anthems.&quot; She also argued &quot;it&#x27;s important to note that &quot;Control&quot;’s self-actualization anthems were expressions of black female pride. &quot;Control&quot; spawned a whopping six videos—great ones, at that—which played an immeasurable role in the shift toward visible black pop.&quot; Gerrick D. Kennedy of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Jackson&#x27;s continued influence is evident in the careers of Rihanna, Beyoncé, Ciara, FKA Twigs and Tinashe in that &quot;all of them take cues from Jackson&#x27;s blueprint. And all that began with &quot;Control&quot;.&quot; In 2016, a cassette of &quot;Control&quot; was added to the &quot;Musical Crossroads&quot; exhibition of the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC).

<doc id="497640" wikidata="Q4596967" url="?curid=497640" title="2-satisfiability">
<text>In computer science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational problem of assigning values to variables, each of which has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.

Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are typically expressed as Boolean formulas of a special type, called conjunctive normal form (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of directed graph, the implication graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of variables as directed edges. Both of these kinds of inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on backtracking or by using the strongly connected components of the implication graph. Resolution, a method for combining pairs of constraints to make additional valid constraints, also leads to a polynomial time solution. The 2-satisfiability problems provide one of two major subclasses of the conjunctive normal form formulas that can be solved in polynomial time; the other of the two subclasses is Horn-satisfiability.

2-satisfiability may be applied to geometry and visualization problems in which a collection of objects each have two potential locations and the goal is to find a placement for each object that avoids overlaps with other objects. Other applications include clustering data to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, classroom and sports scheduling, and recovering shapes from information about their cross-sections.

In computational complexity theory, 2-satisfiability provides an example of an NL-complete problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.

==Problem representations==

A 2-satisfiability problem may be described using a Boolean expression with a special restricted form. It is a conjunction (a Boolean &quot;and&quot; operation) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (a Boolean &quot;or&quot; operation) of two variables or negated variables. The variables or their negations appearing in this formula are known as literals. For example, the following formula is in conjunctive normal form, with seven variables, eleven clauses, and 22 literals:
formula_1

The 2-satisfiability problem is to find a truth assignment to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.

Formulas in this form are known as 2-CNF formulas. The &quot;2&quot; in this name stands for the number of literals per clause, and &quot;CNF&quot; stands for conjunctive normal form, a type of Boolean expression in the form of a conjunction of disjunctions. They are also called Krom formulas, after the work of UC Davis mathematician Melven R. Krom, whose 1967 paper was one of the earliest works on the 2-satisfiability problem.

Each clause in a 2-CNF formula is logically equivalent to an implication from one variable or negated variable to the other. For example, the second clause in the example may be written in any of three equivalent ways:
formula_2
Because of this equivalence between these different types of operation, a 2-satisfiability instance may also be written in implicative normal form, in which we replace each &quot;or&quot; clause in the conjunctive normal form by the two implications to which it is equivalent.

A third, more graphical way of describing a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph in which there is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.

==Algorithms==
Several algorithms are known for solving the 2-satisfiability problem. The most efficient of them take linear time.

===Resolution and transitive closure===
 described the following polynomial time decision procedure for solving 2-satisfiability instances.

Suppose that a 2-satisfiability instance contains two clauses that both use the same variable &quot;x&quot;, but that &quot;x&quot; is negated in one clause and not in the other. Then the two clauses may be combined to produce a third clause, having the two other literals in the two clauses; this third clause must also be satisfied whenever the first two clauses are both satisfied. This is called resolution. For instance, we may combine the clauses formula_3 and formula_4 in this way to produce the clause formula_5. In terms of the implicative form of a 2-CNF formula, this rule amounts to finding two implications formula_6 and formula_7, and inferring by transitivity a third implication formula_8.

Krom writes that a formula is &quot;consistent&quot; if repeated application of this inference rule cannot generate both the clauses formula_9 and formula_10, for any variable formula_11. As he proves, a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if it is consistent. For, if a formula is not consistent, it is not possible to satisfy both of the two clauses formula_12 and formula_13 simultaneously. And, if it is consistent, then the formula can be extended by repeatedly adding one clause of the form formula_12 or formula_10 at a time, preserving consistency at each step, until it includes such a clause for every variable. At each of these extension steps, one of these two clauses may always be added while preserving consistency, for if not then the other clause could be generated using the inference rule. Once all variables have a clause of this form in the formula, a satisfying assignment of all of the variables may be generated by setting a variable formula_11 to true if the formula contains the clause formula_12 and setting it to false if the formula contains the clause formula_13.

Krom was concerned primarily with completeness of systems of inference rules, rather than with the efficiency of algorithms. However, his method leads to a polynomial time bound for solving 2-satisfiability problems. By grouping together all of the clauses that use the same variable, and applying the inference rule to each pair of clauses, it is possible to find all inferences that are possible from a given 2-CNF instance, and to test whether it is consistent, in total time , where is the number of variables in the instance. This formula comes from multiplying the number of variables by the number of pairs of clauses involving a given variable, to which the inference rule may be applied. Thus, it is possible to determine whether a given 2-CNF instance is satisfiable in time . Because finding a satisfying assignment using Krom&#x27;s method involves a sequence of consistency checks, it would take time . quote a faster time bound of for this algorithm, based on more careful ordering of its operations. Nevertheless, even this smaller time bound was greatly improved by the later linear time algorithms of and .

In terms of the implication graph of the 2-satisfiability instance, Krom&#x27;s inference rule can be interpreted as constructing the transitive closure of the graph. As observes, it can also be seen as an instance of the Davis–Putnam algorithm for solving satisfiability problems using the principle of resolution. Its correctness follows from the more general correctness of the Davis–Putnam algorithm. Its polynomial time bound follows from the fact that each resolution step increases the number of clauses in the instance, which is upper bounded by a quadratic function of the number of variables.

===Limited backtracking===
 describe a technique involving limited backtracking for solving constraint satisfaction problems with binary variables and pairwise constraints. They apply this technique to a problem of classroom scheduling, but they also observe that it applies to other problems including 2-SAT.

The basic idea of their approach is to build a partial truth assignment, one variable at a time. Certain steps of the algorithms are &quot;choice points&quot;, points at which a variable can be given either of two different truth values, and later steps in the algorithm may cause it to backtrack to one of these choice points. However, only the most recent choice can be backtracked over. All choices made earlier than the most recent one are permanent.

Initially, there is no choice point, and all variables are unassigned. At each step, the algorithm chooses the variable whose value to set, as follows:
*If there is a clause both of whose variables are already set, in a way that falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.
*If there is a clause in which one of the clause&#x27;s two variables has already been set, and the clause could still become either true or false, then the other variable is set in a way that forces the clause to become true.
*In the remaining case, each clause is either guaranteed to become true no matter how the remaining variables are assigned, or neither of its two variables has been assigned yet. In this case the algorithm creates a new choice point and sets any one of the unassigned variables to an arbitrarily chosen value.

Intuitively, the algorithm follows all chains of inference after making each of its choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, it follows that the choice was a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, the algorithm either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.

Even et al. did not describe in detail how to implement this algorithm efficiently. They state only that by &quot;using appropriate data structures in order to find the implications of any decision&quot;, each step of the algorithm (other than the backtracking) can be performed quickly. However, some inputs may cause the algorithm to backtrack many times, each time performing many steps before backtracking, so its overall complexity may be nonlinear. To avoid this problem, they modify the algorithm so that, after reaching each choice point, it begins simultaneously testing both of the two assignments for the variable set at the choice point, spending equal numbers of steps on each of the two assignments. As soon as the test for one of these two assignments would create another choice point, the other test is stopped, so that at any stage of the algorithm there are only two branches of the backtracking tree that are still being tested. In this way, the total time spent performing the two tests for any variable is proportional to the number of variables and clauses of the input formula whose values are permanently assigned. As a result, the algorithm takes linear time in total.

===Strongly connected components===
 found a simpler linear time procedure for solving 2-satisfiability instances, based on the notion of strongly connected components from graph theory.

Two vertices in a directed graph are said to be strongly connected to each other if there is a directed path from one to the other and vice versa. This is an equivalence relation, and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are strongly connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on depth-first search: Tarjan&#x27;s strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth-first search. Kosaraju&#x27;s algorithm performs two depth-first searches, but is very simple.

In terms of the implication graph, two literals belong to the same strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal to the other and vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong to the same strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a necessary and sufficient condition: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the same strongly connected component as its negation.

This immediately leads to a linear time algorithm for testing satisfiability of 2-CNF formulae: simply perform a strong connectivity analysis on the implication graph and check that each variable and its negation belong to different components. However, as Aspvall et al. also showed, it also leads to a linear time algorithm for finding a satisfying assignment, when one exists. Their algorithm performs the following steps:
*Construct the implication graph of the instance, and find its strongly connected components using any of the known linear-time algorithms for strong connectivity analysis.
*Check whether any strongly connected component contains both a variable and its negation. If so, report that the instance is not satisfiable and halt.
*Construct the condensation of the implication graph, a smaller graph that has one vertex for each strongly connected component, and an edge from component to component whenever the implication graph contains an edge such that belongs to component and belongs to component . The condensation is automatically a directed acyclic graph and, like the implication graph from which it was formed, it is skew-symmetric.
*Topologically order the vertices of the condensation. In practice this may be efficiently achieved as a side effect of the previous step, as components are generated by Kosaraju&#x27;s algorithm in topological order and by Tarjan&#x27;s algorithm in reverse topological order.
*For each component in the reverse topological order, if its variables do not already have truth assignments, set all the literals in the component to be true. This also causes all of the literals in the complementary component to be set to false.

Due to the reverse topological ordering and the skew-symmetry, when a literal is set to true, all literals that can be reached from it via a chain of implications will already have been set to true. Symmetrically, when a literal is set to false, all literals that lead to it via a chain of implications will themselves already have been set to false. Therefore, the truth assignment constructed by this procedure satisfies the given formula, which also completes the proof of correctness of the necessary and sufficient condition identified by Aspvall et al.

As Aspvall et al. show, a similar procedure involving topologically ordering the strongly connected components of the implication graph may also be used to evaluate fully quantified Boolean formulae in which the formula being quantified is a 2-CNF formula.

==Applications==

===Conflict-free placement of geometric objects===
A number of exact and approximate algorithms for the automatic label placement problem are based on 2-satisfiability. This problem concerns placing textual labels on the features of a diagram or map. Typically, the set of possible locations for each label is highly constrained, not only by the map itself (each label must be near the feature it labels, and must not obscure other features), but by each other: every two labels should avoid overlapping each other, for otherwise they would become illegible. In general, finding a label placement that obeys these constraints is an NP-hard problem. However, if each feature has only two possible locations for its label (say, extending to the left and to the right of the feature) then label placement may be solved in polynomial time. For, in this case, one may create a 2-satisfiability instance that has a variable for each label and that has a clause for each pair of labels that could overlap, preventing them from being assigned overlapping positions. If the labels are all congruent rectangles, the corresponding 2-satisfiability instance can be shown to have only linearly many constraints, leading to near-linear time algorithms for finding a labeling. describe a map labeling problem in which each label is a rectangle that may be placed in one of three positions with respect to a line segment that it labels: it may have the segment as one of its sides, or it may be centered on the segment. They represent these three positions using two binary variables in such a way that, again, testing the existence of a valid labeling becomes a 2-satisfiability problem.

 use 2-satisfiability as part of an approximation algorithm for the problem of finding square labels of the largest possible size for a given set of points, with the constraint that each label has one of its corners on the point that it labels. To find a labeling with a given size, they eliminate squares that, if doubled, would overlap another point, and they eliminate points that can be labeled in a way that cannot possibly overlap with another point&#x27;s label. They show that these elimination rules cause the remaining points to have only two possible label placements per point, allowing a valid label placement (if one exists) to be found as the solution to a 2-satisfiability instance. By searching for the largest label size that leads to a solvable 2-satisfiability instance, they find a valid label placement whose labels are at least half as large as the optimal solution. That is, the approximation ratio of their algorithm is at most two. Similarly, if each label is rectangular and must be placed in such a way that the point it labels is somewhere along its bottom edge, then using 2-satisfiability to find the largest label size for which there is a solution in which each label has the point on a bottom corner leads to an approximation ratio of at most two.

Similar applications of 2-satisfiability have been made for other geometric placement problems. In graph drawing, if the vertex locations are fixed and each edge must be drawn as a circular arc with one of two possible locations (for instance as an arc diagram), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge in order to avoid crossings is a 2-satisfiability problem with a variable for each edge and a constraint for each pair of placements that would lead to a crossing. However, in this case it is possible to speed up the solution, compared to an algorithm that builds and then searches an explicit representation of the implication graph, by searching the graph implicitly.
In VLSI integrated circuit design, if a collection of modules must be connected by wires that can each bend at most once, then again there are two possible routes for the wires, and the problem of choosing which of these two routes to use, in such a way that all wires can be routed in a single layer of the circuit, can be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance.

 consider another VLSI design problem: the question of whether or not to mirror-reverse each module in a circuit design. This mirror reversal leaves the module&#x27;s operations unchanged, but it changes the order of the points at which the input and output signals of the module connect to it, possibly changing how well the module fits into the rest of the design. Boros &quot;et al.&quot; consider a simplified version of the problem in which the modules have already been placed along a single linear channel, in which the wires between modules must be routed, and there is a fixed bound on the density of the channel (the maximum number of signals that must pass through any cross-section of the channel). They observe that this version of the problem may be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance, in which the constraints relate the orientations of pairs of modules that are directly across the channel from each other. As a consequence, the optimal density may also be calculated efficiently, by performing a binary search in which each step involves the solution of a 2-satisfiability instance.

===Data clustering===
One way of clustering a set of data points in a metric space into two clusters is to choose the clusters in such a way as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.

The same method also can be used as a subroutine when the individual cluster diameters are unknown. To test whether a given sum of diameters can be achieved without knowing the individual cluster diameters, one may try all maximal pairs of target diameters that add up to at most the given sum, representing each pair of diameters as a 2-satisfiability instance and using a 2-satisfiability algorithm to determine whether that pair can be realized by a clustering. To find the optimal sum of diameters one may perform a binary search in which each step is a feasibility test of this type. The same approach also works to find clusterings that optimize other combinations than sums of the cluster diameters, and that use arbitrary dissimilarity numbers (rather than distances in a metric space) to measure the size of a cluster. The time bound for this algorithm is dominated by the time to solve a sequence of 2-satisfiability instances that are closely related to each other, and shows how to solve these related instances more quickly than if they were solved independently from each other, leading to a total time bound of for the sum-of-diameters clustering problem.

===Scheduling===
 consider a model of classroom scheduling in which a set of &quot;n&quot; teachers must be scheduled to teach each of &quot;m&quot; cohorts of students. The number of hours per week that teacher formula_19 spends with cohort formula_20 is described by entry formula_21 of a matrix formula_22 given as input to the problem, and each teacher also has a set of hours during which he or she is available to be scheduled. As they show, the problem is NP-complete, even when each teacher has at most three available hours, but it can be solved as an instance of 2-satisfiability when each teacher only has two available hours. (Teachers with only a single available hour may easily be eliminated from the problem.) In this problem, each variable formula_23 corresponds to an hour that teacher formula_19 must spend with cohort formula_20, the assignment to the variable specifies whether that hour is the first or the second of the teacher&#x27;s available hours, and there is a 2-satisfiability clause preventing any conflict of either of two types: two cohorts assigned to a teacher at the same time as each other, or one cohort assigned to two teachers at the same time.

 apply 2-satisfiability to a problem of sports scheduling, in which the pairings of a round-robin tournament have already been chosen and the games must be assigned to the teams&#x27; stadiums. In this problem, it is desirable to alternate home and away games to the extent possible, avoiding &quot;breaks&quot; in which a team plays two home games in a row or two away games in a row. At most two teams can avoid breaks entirely, alternating between home and away games; no other team can have the same home-away schedule as these two, because then it would be unable to play the team with which it had the same schedule. Therefore, an optimal schedule has two breakless teams and a single break for every other team. Once one of the breakless teams is chosen, one can set up a 2-satisfiability problem in which each variable represents the home-away assignment for a single team in a single game, and the constraints enforce the properties that any two teams have a consistent assignment for their games, that each team have at most one break before and at most one break after the game with the breakless team, and that no team has two breaks. Therefore, testing whether a schedule admits a solution with the optimal number of breaks can be done by solving a linear number of 2-satisfiability problems, one for each choice of the breakless team. A similar technique also allows finding schedules in which every team has a single break, and maximizing rather than minimizing the number of breaks (to reduce the total mileage traveled by the teams).

===Discrete tomography===

Tomography is the process of recovering shapes from their cross-sections. In discrete tomography, a simplified version of the problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only the total number of squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version of the problem is that we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.

Although there exist polynomial time algorithms to find a matrix having given row and column sums, the solution may be far from unique: any submatrix in the form of a 2 × 2 identity matrix can be complemented without affecting the correctness of the solution. Therefore, researchers have searched for constraints on the shape to be reconstructed that can be used to restrict the space of solutions. For instance, one might assume that the shape is connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete. An even more constrained version that is easier to solve is that the shape is orthogonally convex: having a single contiguous block of squares in each row and column.
Improving several previous solutions, showed how to reconstruct connected orthogonally convex shapes efficiently, using 2-SAT. The idea of their solution is to guess the indexes of rows containing the leftmost and rightmost cells of the shape to be reconstructed, and then to set up a 2-satisfiability problem that tests whether there exists a shape consistent with these guesses and with the given row and column sums. They use four 2-satisfiability variables for each square that might be part of the given shape, one to indicate whether it belongs to each of four possible &quot;corner regions&quot; of the shape, and they use constraints that force these regions to be disjoint, to have the desired shapes, to form an overall shape with contiguous rows and columns, and to have the desired row and column sums. Their algorithm takes time where is the smaller of the two dimensions of the input shape and is the larger of the two dimensions. The same method was later extended to orthogonally convex shapes that might be connected only diagonally instead of requiring orthogonal connectivity.

A part of a solver for full nonogram puzzles, used 2-satisfiability to combine information obtained from several other heuristics. Given a partial solution to the puzzle, they use dynamic programming within each row or column to determine whether the constraints of that row or column force any of its squares to be white or black, and whether any two squares in the same row or column can be connected by an implication relation. They also transform the nonogram into a digital tomography problem by replacing the sequence of block lengths in each row and column by its sum, and use a maximum flow formulation to determine whether this digital tomography problem combining all of the rows and columns has any squares whose state can be determined or pairs of squares that can be connected by an implication relation. If either of these two heuristics determines the value of one of the squares, it is included in the partial solution and the same calculations are repeated. However, if both heuristics fail to set any squares, the implications found by both of them are combined into a 2-satisfiability problem and a 2-satisfiability solver is used to find squares whose value is fixed by the problem, after which the procedure is again repeated. This procedure may or may not succeed in finding a solution, but it is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. Batenburg and Kosters report that, although most newspaper puzzles do not need its full power, both this procedure and a more powerful but slower procedure which combines this 2-satisfiability approach with the limited backtracking of are significantly more effective than the dynamic programming and flow heuristics without 2-satisfiability when applied to more difficult randomly generated nonograms.

===Renamable Horn satisfiability===
Next to 2-satisfiability, the other major subclass of satisfiability problems that can be solved in polynomial time is Horn-satisfiability. In this class of satisfiability problems, the input is again a formula in conjunctive normal form. It can have arbitrarily many literals per clause but at most one positive literal. found a generalization of this class, &quot;renamable Horn satisfiability&quot;, that can still be solved in polynomial time by means of an auxiliary 2-satisfiability instance. A formula is &quot;renamable Horn&quot; when it is possible to put it into Horn form by replacing some variables by their negations. To do so, Lewis sets up a 2-satisfiability instance with one variable for each variable of the renamable Horn instance, where the 2-satisfiability variables indicate whether or not to negate the corresponding renamable Horn variables.
In order to produce a Horn instance, no two variables that appear in the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint on a pair of variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint. By finding a satisfying assignment to the resulting 2-satisfiability instance, Lewis shows how to turn any renamable Horn instance into a Horn instance in polynomial time. By breaking up long clauses into multiple smaller clauses, and applying a linear-time 2-satisfiability algorithm, it is possible to reduce this to linear time.

===Other applications===
2-satisfiability has also been applied to problems of recognizing undirected graphs that can be partitioned into an independent set and a small number of complete bipartite subgraphs, inferring business relationships among autonomous subsystems of the internet, and reconstruction of evolutionary trees.

==Complexity and extensions==

===NL-completeness===
A nondeterministic algorithm for determining whether a 2-satisfiability instance is &quot;not&quot; satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable memory, is easy to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable &quot;v&quot; and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from &quot;v&quot; to its negation and then back to &quot;v&quot;. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.

2-satisfiability is NL-complete, meaning that it is one of the &quot;hardest&quot; or &quot;most expressive&quot; problems in the complexity class NL of problems solvable nondeterministically in logarithmic space. Completeness here means that a deterministic Turing machine using only logarithmic space can transform any other problem in NL into an equivalent 2-satisfiability problem. Analogously to similar results for the more well-known complexity class &quot;NP&quot;, this transformation together with the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem allow any problem in NL to be represented as a second order logic formula with a single existentially quantified predicate with clauses limited to length 2. Such formulae are known as SO-Krom. Similarly, the implicative normal form can be expressed in first order logic with the addition of an operator for transitive closure.

===The set of all solutions===

The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance has the structure of a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of flipping the values of a set of variables that are all constrained to be equal or unequal to each other. In particular, by following edges in this way one can get from any solution to any other solution. Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three solutions is formed by setting each variable to the value it holds in the majority of the three solutions. This median always forms another solution to the instance.

 describes an algorithm for efficiently listing all solutions to a given 2-satisfiability instance, and for solving several related problems.
There also exist algorithms for finding two satisfying assignments that have the maximal Hamming distance from each other.

===Counting the number of satisfying assignments===
#2SAT is the problem of counting the number of satisfying assignments to a given 2-CNF formula. This counting problem is #P-complete, which implies that it is not solvable in polynomial time unless P = NP. Moreover, there is no fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme for #2SAT unless NP = RP and this even holds when the input is restricted to monotone 2-CNF formulas, i.e., 2-CNF formulas in which each literal is a positive occurrence of a variable.

The fastest known algorithm for computing the exact number of satisfying assignments to a 2SAT formula runs in time formula_26.

===Random 2-satisfiability instances===

One can form a 2-satisfiability instance at random, for a given number &quot;n&quot; of variables and &quot;m&quot; of clauses, by choosing each clause uniformly at random from the set of all possible two-variable clauses. When &quot;m&quot; is small relative to &quot;n&quot;, such an instance will likely be satisfiable, but larger values of &quot;m&quot; have smaller probabilities of being satisfiable. More precisely, if &quot;m&quot;/&quot;n&quot; is fixed as a constant α ≠ 1, the probability of satisfiability tends to a limit as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity: if α &lt; 1, the limit is one, while if α &gt; 1, the limit is zero. Thus, the problem exhibits a phase transition at α = 1.

===Maximum-2-satisfiability ===
In the maximum-2-satisfiability problem (MAX-2-SAT), the input is a formula in conjunctive normal form with two literals per clause, and the task is to determine the maximum number of clauses that can be simultaneously satisfied by an assignment. Like the more general maximum satisfiability problem, MAX-2-SAT is NP-hard. The proof is by reduction from 3SAT.

By formulating MAX-2-SAT as a problem of finding a cut (that is, a partition of the vertices into two subsets) maximizing the number of edges that have one endpoint in the first subset and one endpoint in the second, in a graph related to the implication graph, and applying semidefinite programming methods to this cut problem, it is possible to find in polynomial time an approximate solution that satisfies at least 0.940... times the optimal number of clauses. A &quot;balanced&quot; MAX 2-SAT instance is an instance of MAX 2-SAT where every variable appears positively and negatively with equal weight. For this problem, Austrin has improved the approximation ratio to formula_27.

If the unique games conjecture is true, then it is impossible to approximate MAX 2-SAT, balanced or not, with an approximation constant better than 0.943... in polynomial time. Under the weaker assumption that P ≠ NP, the problem is only known to be inapproximable within a constant better than 21/22 = 0.95454...

Various authors have also explored exponential worst-case time bounds for exact solution of MAX-2-SAT instances.

===Weighted-2-satisfiability===
In the weighted 2-satisfiability problem (W2SAT), the input is an formula_28-variable 2SAT instance and an integer , and the problem is to decide whether there exists a satisfying assignment in which exactly of the variables are true.

The W2SAT problem includes as a special case the vertex cover problem, of finding a set of vertices that together touch all the edges of a given undirected graph. For any given instance of the vertex cover problem, one can construct an equivalent W2SAT problem with a variable for each vertex of a graph. Each edge of the graph may be represented by a 2SAT clause that can be satisfied only by including either or among the true variables of the solution. Then the satisfying instances of the resulting 2SAT formula encode solutions to the vertex cover problem, and there is a satisfying assignment with true variables if and only if there is a vertex cover with vertices. Therefore, like vertex cover, W2SAT is NP-complete.

Moreover, in parameterized complexity W2SAT provides a natural W[1]-complete problem, which implies that W2SAT is not fixed-parameter tractable unless this holds for all problems in W[1]. That is, it is unlikely that there exists an algorithm for W2SAT whose running time takes the form . Even more strongly, W2SAT cannot be solved in time unless the exponential time hypothesis fails.

===Quantified Boolean formulae===
As well as finding the first polynomial-time algorithm for 2-satisfiability, also formulated the problem of evaluating fully quantified Boolean formulae in which the formula being quantified is a 2-CNF formula. The 2-satisfiability problem is the special case of this quantified 2-CNF problem, in which all quantifiers are existential. Krom also developed an effective decision procedure for these formulae. showed that it can be solved in linear time, by an extension of their technique of strongly connected components and topological ordering.

===Many-valued logics===
The 2-satisfiability problem can also be asked for propositional many-valued logics. The algorithms are not usually linear, and for some logics the problem is even NP-complete. See for surveys.

<text>Alvin Ailey Jr. (January 5, 1931 – December 1, 1989) was an American dancer, director, choreographer, and activist who founded the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (AAADT). He created AAADT and its affiliated Alvin Ailey American Dance Center (later Ailey School) as havens for nurturing Black artists and expressing the universality of the African-American experience through dance.

Ailey&#x27;s work fused theater, modern dance, ballet, and jazz with Black vernacular, creating hope-fueled choreography that is credited with spreading global awareness of Black life in America. Ailey&#x27;s choreographic masterpiece &quot;Revelations&quot; is recognized as one of the most popular and most performed ballets in the world.

On July 15, 2008, the United States Congress passed a resolution designating AAADT a &quot;vital American cultural ambassador to the World&quot;. That same year, in recognition of AAADT&#x27;s 50th anniversary, then Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared December 4 &quot;Alvin Ailey Day&quot; in New York City, while then-Governor David Paterson honored the organization on behalf of New York State.

==Early life and education==
Ailey was born to Alvin Ailey and Lula Elizabeth Cliff in Rogers, Texas, in his maternal grandfather&#x27;s home at the height of the Great Depression. As a child in the violently racist and segregated south, during his youth Ailey was barred from interacting with mainstream society. When he was five, Ailey&#x27;s mother was raped by four white men (one likely an employer), and Ailey recalled seeing members of the Ku Klux Klan as a child.

The elder Alvin Ailey abandoned the young Alvin and Lula shortly after Alvin was born, leaving Lula to work in cotton fields and as a domestic in white homes — the only employment available to her. By the time Ailey was five, he joined his mother picking cotton. After a white man raped Lula in 1936, Ailey began to fear white men. As an escape, Ailey found refuge in the church, sneaking out at night to watch adults dance, and in writing a journal, a practice that he maintained his entire life. Even this could not shield him from a childhood spent moving from town to town as his mother sought employment, being abandoned with relatives whenever she took off on her own.

Looking for greater job prospects, Ailey&#x27;s mother departed for Los Angeles in 1941. He arrived a year later, enrolling at George Washington Carver Junior High School, and then graduating into Thomas Jefferson High School. He was able to explore the arts in high school, singing in glee club and writing poetry. He also took gymnastics. He frequently attended the Lincoln and Orpheum Theatres, where he was able to see a variety of African American performers, including Pearl Bailey, Fletcher Henderson, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Pigmeat Markham, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington. In 1946, Ailey had his first experience with concert dance, awakening an until then unknown spark of joy within him, when he saw Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo on a school trip and Katherine Dunham Dance Company&#x27;s &quot;Tropical Review&quot; on solitary trips to the Los Angeles Philharmonic Auditorium.

Also in high school, Ailey discovered his homosexuality, which added another layer of difference and isolation to his already racially segregated experience. Thus, &quot;like many young gay men eager to corral the sensual impulses of the body, he turned to dance study.&quot; He briefly studied tap, followed by exploring &quot;primitive dance&quot;, as taught by Dunham dancer Thelma Robinson. Neither of these styles were right for Ailey, possibly due to the physical location and old-fashioned sensibility of the lessons. Therefore, he did not become serious about dance until 1949 when his classmate and friend Carmen De Lavallade dragged him to the Melrose Avenue studio of Lester Horton and he began exploring modern dance.

Ailey studied a wide range of dance styles and techniques — from ballet to Native American inspired movement studies — at Horton&#x27;s school, which was one of the first racially integrated dance schools in the United States. Though Horton became his mentor, Ailey did not commit to dancing full-time, recognizing the lack of opportunities for black male dancers. Instead, he pursued academic courses, studying romance languages and writing at UCLA (1949), Los Angeles City College (1950–1951), and San Francisco State University (1952). During this time, he sporadically returned to Horton to work between courses. Living in San Francisco, he met Maya Angelou, then known as Marguerite Johnson, with whom he formed a nightclub act called &quot;Al and Rita&quot;. Eventually, he returned to study dance with Horton in Los Angeles.

==Career==
=== Horton Dance Company ===
Ailey joined Horton&#x27;s dance company in 1953. While there, he took daily technique classes, studied art and music, and taught children&#x27;s classes. In 1953, he made his debut in Horton&#x27;s &quot;Revue Le Bal Caribe&quot;. In a workshop the summer of 1953, Ailey created his first dance composition, &quot;Afternoon Blues&quot;. This work was a three-minute solo blues adaptation of &quot;L&#x27;Aprés-midi d’un Faune&quot;, which he had seen performed by the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. In this piece, Ailey played the eponymous Faun to a selection from &quot;On the Town&quot;.

Horton died suddenly November 1953 from a heart attack, leaving the company without leadership. In order to complete the organization&#x27;s pressing professional engagements, and because no one else was willing to, Ailey took over as artistic director and choreographer. In particular, Horton&#x27;s company was committed to performing at Jacob&#x27;s Pillow in the summer of 1954. Ailey worked collaboratively with the Horton company dancers and choreographed based on them, gaining the support of the company&#x27;s dancers who had much more experience than Ailey. These works included &quot;According to St. Francis&quot; (4 June 1954), a tribute to Horton as a &quot;kind of allusion to Lester&#x27;s life&quot; featuring James Truitte. He also choreographed and directed &quot;Morning Mourning&quot; (4 June 1954)&quot;,&quot; a piece based on the work of Tennessee Williams featuring de Lavallade and set to an original score by Gertrude Rivers Robinson. As Horton had done, Ailey designed the sets for &quot;Morning Mourning&quot; and collaborated on the lighting. That summer, Ailey also made his first large group piece, &quot;Creation of the World&quot; (13 July 1954), set to a score by Darius Milhaud. Under Ailey, the Horton company had commercial engagements on television programs &quot;Party at Ciro&#x27;s&quot;, The Red Skelton Show, and the Jack Benny show. Ailey and de Lavallade also performed in a segment of Carmen Jones.

=== Early New York career ===

In December, 1954 De Lavallade and Ailey were recruited by Herbert Ross (who had choreographed &quot;Carmen Jones)&quot; to join the Broadway show, &quot;House of Flowers.&quot; Ross had been hired to replace George Balanchine as the show&#x27;s choreographer and he wanted to use the pair, who had become known as a famous dance team in Los Angeles, as featured dancers. The show&#x27;s book was written and adapted by Truman Capote from one of his novellas with music from Harold Arlen and starred Pearl Bailey and Diahann Carroll.

Ailey and De Lavallade met Geoffrey Holder, who performed alongside them in the chorus, during the production. Holder married De Lavallade and became a life-long artistic collaborator with Ailey. After &quot;House of Flowers&quot; closed, Ailey appeared in Harry Belafonte&#x27;s touring revue &quot;Sing, Man, Sing&quot; with Mary Hinkson as his dance partner, and the 1957 Broadway musical &quot;Jamaica&quot;, which starred Lena Horne and Ricardo Montalbán. Throughout the late 1950s, Ailey continued to study dance technique sporadically, learning with the New Dance Group&#x27;s Hanya Holm, Anna Sokolow, Charles Weidman, and Karel Shook. Drawn to dance, but unable to find a choreographer whose work fulfilled him and wanting to continue the work he had begun at the Horton school, Ailey started gathering dancers to perform his own unique vision of dance.

===Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater===

==== The early Alvin Ailey Dance Theater ====
In 1958 Ailey founded the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater to present his vision of honoring Black culture through dance. The company had its debut at the 92nd Street YM-YWHA on March 30, 1958 in a concert shared with choreographer Ernest Parham, with headlining guest artist Talley Beatty. The performance included Ailey&#x27;s first masterpiece, &quot;Blues Suite&quot;, which drew from Ailey&#x27;s Texas childhood and &quot;House of Flowers&quot;, following men and women as they caroused and cavorted over the course of an evening while blues music played in the background until church bells began to ring, signaling a return to mundane life. Ailey danced in the other two premieres at this performance, &quot;Redonda&quot; and &quot;Ode and Homage&quot;. &quot;Redonda&quot;, which was later retitled &quot;Cinco Latinos&quot;, brought together five short pieces described as &quot;Latin Theme&quot; in a work similar to Horton&#x27;s. &quot;Ode and Homage&quot;, set to a score by Peggy Glanville-Hicks, was a &quot;dance of faith, respectfully dedicated to the memory of Lester Horton&quot;.

Following the success of his first concert, Ailey continued choreographing for a shifting roster of dancers who were available for dances at the 92nd Street YM-YWHA, working with designers Normand Maxon, Ves Harper, and Nicola Cernovich. These works included the integrated &quot;Ariette Oubliée&quot; (December 21, 1958, a choreographic fantasy pantomime set to Debussy&#x27;s similarly named song cycle and featuring Don Price and de Lavallade. He also choreographed for other companies in collaborations, such as a version of Miss Julie, &quot;Mistress and Manservant&quot;, to a score by Ravel for the Shirley Broughton Dance Company.

On January 31, 1960, the AADT premiered several new works at the 92nd Street YM-YWHA. These included &quot;Sonera&quot;, Ailey&#x27;s first attempt at choreographing on point. Ailey also reworked &quot;Creation of the World&quot; for this performance as a duet for himself and Matt Turney of the Martha Graham Dance Company, which received great acclaim. He also premiered his most popular and critically acclaimed work, &quot;Revelations.&quot; In creating &quot;Revelations,&quot; Ailey drew upon his &quot;blood memories&quot; of growing up in Texas surrounded by Black people, the church, spirituals, and the blues. The ballet charts the full range of feelings, from the majestic &quot;I Been ’Buked&quot; to the rapturous &quot;Wade in the Water&quot;, closing with the electrifying finale, &quot;Rocka My Soul in the Bosom of Abraham&quot;.

In 1960, Edele Holz offered Ailey rehearsal space at what would become the Clark Center for the Performing Arts. Shortly after the center opened in October of that year, AADT had its first concert. This concert included a November 27, 1960 premiered &quot;Knoxville: Summer of 1915,&quot; set to music by Samuel Barber and based on &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; and &quot;Three for Now&quot;, set to music by Jimmy Giuffre and John Lewis (pianist), as well as Horton&#x27;s &quot;The Beloved&quot; and John Butler&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Billie.&quot; The next year, he premiered &quot;Hermit Songs&quot; (10 December 1961)&quot;.&quot; Originally conceived as a group work, it premiered as a solo for Ailey performed to Leontyne Price&#x27;s recording of Samuel Barber&#x27;s Hermit Songs. &quot;Hermit Songs,&quot; which is based on a loose narrative of a monk&#x27;s privilege and penance, remained in the AADT&#x27;s repertoire through 1991.

Ailey&#x27;s work during this time was different from that of many other modern dance choreographers of the time. By keeping a focus on narrative, he was able to draw an audience from outside New York City and the avant garde.

=== Work with the US State Department and later work ===
In the fall of 1961, the US State Department invited the AADT (under the banner of the Lavallade-Ailey American Dance Company) to tour Southeast Asia and Australia as a part of President Kennedy&#x27;s Special International Program for Cultural Presentations. This led Ailey to assemble a repertory that the State Department would find appropriate, including a new dance, &quot;Been Here and Gone,&quot; a suite of folk songs and children&#x27;s games based on Donald McKayle&#x27;s &quot;Games&quot; (which Ailey had performed in 1956) and his own memories of growing up in Texas. He also assembled a company of ten dancers and four musicians that could travel the world. This tour began on 3 February in Sydney, Australia, and ended on 12 May 1962 in Seoul, South Korea, performing sixty times in thirteen weeks. As necessary, Ailey reworked material to fit the shifting roster of collaborators. Many of the works, including &quot;Roots of the Blues&quot; and &quot;Revelations&quot; were specifically reworked to feature the headlining de Lavallade. The tour had followups at the World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal in 1966, East &amp; West Africa in 1967, and the Edinburgh Festival in 1968. Biographer Thomas DeFrantz notes how the Ailey company&#x27;s status as &quot;the sole exponent of an emerging standard of African American concert dance&quot; allowed the U.S. government to covertly mold the &quot;signature style of Afro-American concert dance&quot;. He also notes that State Department propaganda aided in promoting the international celebrity of the AADT.

The relationship with the State Department did not go well and ended after a few years. Ailey struggled with the state department tours, which insisted on marketing the company as an &quot;ethnic&quot; company rather than a modern dance company, and were closely supervised by the FBI - the latter referred to Ailey&#x27;s homosexuality as &quot;lewd and criminal tendencies&quot; and threatened his company with bankruptcy if he showed any signs of effeminate or homosexual behavior while on tour.

Despite their work with the State Department, the company was able to book only a few performances per season in America. For a major concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on 28 April 1963, Ailey reworked movements of &quot;Revelations&quot; into &quot;Reflections in D&quot; (set to music by Duke Ellington) which, combined with &quot;Suspensions&quot;, and &quot;Gillespiana&quot; made the latest version of &quot;Three for Now&quot;. Ailey also premiered &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, telling the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, which was later reborn as &quot;Ariadne&quot;.

Also in 1963, Ailey began his professional relationship with Duke Ellington. Ellington invited Ailey to perform in &quot;My People (First Negro Centennial)&quot;, a travelogue history in observance of the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation. For the August 19 performance, Ailey coreographed three pieces, &quot;The Blues Ain&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Light&quot;, and &quot;My Mother My Father&quot;. While working with Ellington, Ailey and his company were invited to the International Music Festival in Rio de Janeiro. For this performance, feeling the occasion required a new work, Ailey premiered &quot;Rivers, Streams, and Doors&quot;.

In August 1964, Ailey choreographed a dance, &quot;The Twelve Gates,&quot; in honor of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn&#x27;s golden anniversary. This performance, featuring Truitte and de Lavallade, and with costumes by Holder, was performed for a single week at Jacob&#x27;s Pillow. In the fall of 1964, Ailey added &quot;American&quot; to his company&#x27;s name during a three-month European tour. In 1965, following physical tensions and negative reviews at the Florentine Festival, Ailey retired from his career as a dancer. Ailey paused choreography until receiving a lucrative commission by the Swedish television for &quot;Riedaiglia&quot;, which was danced to a commissioned score by Georg Riedel and relied heavily on television director Lars Egler&#x27;s direction. This dance immediately won the television award the Grand Prix Italia, and was later broadcast in the United States on &quot;Ambassadors of Dance.&quot;

In the summer of 1968, Ailey received a Guggenheim Fellowship. With these funds, he created his first work set to pop music, choreographing &quot;Quintet&quot; to six songs from Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. This work debuted at the 1968 Edinburgh Festival, and premiered in New York at the Billy Rose Theatre as a part of AAADT&#x27;s first Broadway season. The next year, he created &quot;Diversion No.1,&quot; including dances to Scarborough Fair and Oh Happy Day for a program shared with The 5th Dimension. This work, created to attract audiences to the AAADT&#x27;s UCLA season, was one of Ailey&#x27;s most commercial pieces.

In a twelve-day residency at Connecticut College in 1968, Ailey created &quot;Masekela Langage&quot;, a piece set in South Africa. This work directly addresses racial politics with the intention of drawing a parallel between the Apartheid and the shooting to death of Fred Hampton. This politicism was uncommon for Ailey&#x27;s work. The piece received immediate acclaim, and is regularly revived by the AAADT.

After a successful week-long engagement at the Billy Rose Theatre, the company was invited to become the resident company at Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1969. This residency included a revival of &quot;Revelations.&quot; While working with BAM, he sponsored free classes for children and young adults &quot;geared to channel formidable youth rage into art&quot;. Ailey was dissatisfied with the residency due to cramped quarters and BAM director Harvey Lichtenstein&#x27;s racialized business tactics.

In 1970, with few bookings on the radar — and on the eve of a tour to Russia as part of a cultural exchange agreement — Ailey announced at a press conference that he was closing the company. In response, the State Department sponsored an Ailey tour of North Africa to tide things over. That August, the company toured to Russia, where it was ecstatically received. The AAADT became the first American modern dance company to perform in the Soviet Union. Their performances were broadcast on Moscow television and seen by over 22 million viewers. On closing night, because the Russian audiences would not stop applauding, the company gave over 30 curtain calls. Returning home with news of this triumph, the company performed a two-week engagement at the ANTA Theater. At this performance, he premiered &quot;Flowers&quot;, set to music by Blind Faith, Pink Floyd, and Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company. &quot;Flowers,&quot; which featured Lynn Seymour, depicted the death of a rock star caused by drug addiction, inspired by Joplin&#x27;s death on October 3, 1970, and dedicated to &quot;a slew of rockers making youth-oriented music&quot;. By the end of the January 1971 performance, the entire run was sold out. After 13 years, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre was a monumental success.

In August 1972, the company was briefly renamed Alvin Ailey City Center Dance Theater and became a resident company of New York City Center. In September of that year, Ailey created &quot;Shaken Angels&quot;, another rock-based piece. This piece, set to recorded music by Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd, and Bill Withers, featured Dennis Wayne and Bonnie Mathis in story about a couple &quot;cornered into a relationship of violence and need, smoking pot and mainlining heroin. The work spilled into the audience as Wayne chased Mathis through the aisles, dragging her onto the stage and striking her with a needle.

In 1973, the AAADT headlined the First National Congress on Blacks in Dance, though Ailey sat out of conversations on how to advance the public perception and financial profiles of black dance companies.

In 1975, Ailey restaged &quot;Revelations&quot; for nineteen dancers for a staging at the New York State Theater from August 12 to 24.

While Ailey choreographed more than 100 ballets for his dancers, he insisted that the company perform pieces by other choreographers rather than stand as a singular vehicle for his voice.

Though AAADT was formed to celebrate African-American culture and to provide performances for black dancers, who were frequently denied opportunities due to racist mores of the time, Ailey proudly employed artists based solely on artistic talent and integrity, regardless of their background. In addition to his work as artistic director and choreographer with AAADT, Ailey also choreographed ballets for other companies including American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet, and The Metropolitan Opera. For American Ballet Theatre, he created &quot;The River&quot; (1970), one of several choreographies he set to the jazz music of Duke Ellington.

=== Commercial work ===
Throughout his career, Ailey continued to pursue work as a commercial theater choreographer, re-staging &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (August 1959) and Jamaica (1960) for Summer stock theater and staging dances for the theatrical review &quot;African Holiday&quot; (1960) and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (May 1960). These commercial engagements remained segregated, with African-American casts generally hired to entertain mostly white audiences. Ailey also studied acting with Stella Adler from 1960 to 1962, acting in non-dancing roles in dramatic plays including Call Me by My Rightful Name (January 1961) with costars Robert Duvall and Joan Hackett, and &quot;Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright&quot;, also starting Roscoe Lee Browne, Al Freeman Jr., Claudia McNeil, Diana Sands, and Cicely Tyson. These plays all constructed race as a societal force and &quot;agent of division&quot;.

In 1964, at a direct request from Langston Hughes, Ailey directed Jerico-Jim Crow with William Hairston. His one attempt at Broadway choreography, La Strada (musical), opened and closed in one performance on December 14, 1969.

===The Ailey School===
In 1969, Ailey founded the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center with the famed Martha Graham Dance Company principal and choreographer Pearl Lang as his co-director of the school. Their aim was to provide access to arts and dance to under-resourced communities. They started off in Brooklyn with 125 students. A year later the school relocated to Manhattan behind the Lincoln Center complex. In 1984, Denise Jefferson assumed directorship. Under her leadership, the school developed a Bachelor of Fine Arts Program in partnership with Fordham University in 1998.

The school was renamed The Ailey School in 1999. Several years later, the school moved into The Joan Weill Center for Dance. Following Jefferson&#x27;s death in 2010, Tracy Inman and Melanie Person assumed stewardship of the school as co-directors of the school. In 2012, after leading Ailey 2 for 38 years, Sylvia Waters retired. The second company&#x27;s resident choreographer and associate director Troy Powell took over her role as artistic director. With the addition of the Elaine Wynn and Family Education Wing, the Ailey school is still growing and is now the largest place in New York City committed to training dancers.

From her joining in 1965, the dancer Judith Jamison served as Ailey&#x27;s muse. In 1971 she premiered &quot;Cry&quot;, which he dedicated to his mother and black women everywhere. She took over as artistic director following his death in 1989.

Other important figures in the company include Sylvia Waters, who in 1974, after performing with the company for six year was asked by Ailey to lead The Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble — a junior company, known today as Ailey 2, that prepares leading students for professional dance careers - and Masazumi Chaya, who danced with the company for 15 years then became rehearsal director, and was appointed associate artistic director in 1991.

==Personal life==
Ailey was uncomfortable with the label &quot;Black choreographer&quot; and preferred being known simply as a choreographer, while also acknowledging to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1987: &quot;Of course there is something black in my work: me and my 56 years.&quot; Ailey, who was gay and bipolar, was known to be private about his personal life.

===Death===
Ailey died from an AIDS-related illness on December 1, 1989 at the age of 58. He asked his doctor to announce that his death was caused by terminal blood dyscrasia in order to shield his mother from the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS.

On December 9, 1989, more than 4,000 mourners attended his funeral at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The funeral, which lasted two hours, featured his friend Maya Angelou reading an oral interpretation of her poem &quot;For Alvin Ailey&quot;, drumming by Max Roach, a reading of a statement from President George H. W. Bush, and eulogies by Carmen de Lavallade, Judith Jamison, and New York City Mayor David Dinkins. The funeral also included performances of Ailey&#x27;s choreography on a makeshift stage constructed around his casket. These included Dudley Williams performing &quot;Song for You&quot;, Donna Wood dancing an excerpt from &quot;Cry&quot;, and excerpts from &quot;Revelations&quot; performed by Mari Kajiwara, John Parks, and members of his dance company.

Ailey was buried in Los Angeles.

After his death, Ailey’s personal papers were housed at the Black Archives of Mid-America in Kansas City, Missouri.

===Documentary===
In 2021, the documentary &quot;Ailey&quot; by director Jamila Wignot was released in the United States. Wignot first discovered the work of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater by attending a performance while she was a student at Wellesley College; in her documentary more than twenty years later, Alexandra Villarreal of &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes, &quot;What emerges is a towering figure who won worldwide acclaim with art steeped in personal experience, yet was too afraid to openly share his full identity even in death.&quot;

Though Ailey&#x27;s work has been met with popular and critical acclaim, there have been detractors of his theatrical style. Marcia Siegel accused the company of &quot;selling soul&quot;, and of amplifying and transforming the emotivity characteristic of Martha Graham and his modern dance teachers into &quot;metaphors of the American black experience&quot; ,while creating a positive stereotype of &quot;supremely physical, supremely sensitive beings&quot; at the expense of &quot;genuineness&quot;.

Ailey responded to such criticism by stating, &quot;The black pieces we do that come from blues, spirituals and gospels are part of what I am. They are as honest and truthful as we can make them. I&#x27;m interested in putting something on stage that will have a very wide appeal without being condescending; that will reach an audience and make it part of the dance; that will get everybody into the theater. If it&#x27;s art and entertainment — thank God, that&#x27;s what I want to be.&quot;

<text>Walter Plinge is a pseudonym, used in British theatres since the 19th century on occasions when it is not possible or desirable to make an actor&#x27;s real name known.
==Name and usage==
Walter Plinge is a pseudonym traditionally used in British theatres when a part has not been cast, an actor is playing two parts, or an actor does not want their name in the programme. The name has also been used in radio and television credits. &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Theatre&quot; has this entry for the name:
In 1939 Alfred Wareing, a former member of Benson&#x27;s company, wrote in &quot;The Stage&quot; that the real Walter Plinge had been the landlord of the public house in Wellington Street near the stage door of the Lyceum Theatre, London. Wareing recalled that Plinge was not entirely pleased at having his name used by Benson, particularly as the company already had other pseudonyms in use when needed. These included &quot;R. Sherard&quot; and &quot;T. Ashman&quot; – the latter used by among others Oscar Asche when doubling roles, although in Asche&#x27;s case, according to Wareing, the false name &quot;never deceived the knowing public&quot;. Another former Bensonian recalled the pseudonym &quot;Hugh S. Hay&quot; being used when the American actor Walter Hampden was in the company. The actor-manager Murray Carrington recalled that in the 1920s his company had featured not only Walter Plinge Jr. but also a female counterpart, Juliet Plinge.

The name Walter Plinge has been used occasionally in American theatre, where the more usual equivalent is &quot;George Spelvin&quot;. Analogous pseudonyms – for writers rather than actors – are Alan Smithee in Hollywood and David Agnew at the BBC. From its earliest years the BBC has used &quot;Walter Plinge&quot; in its listings of acting roles, and &quot;he&quot; is the corporation&#x27;s longest-serving broadcaster, having made his first broadcast in 1925, with subsequent appearances up to 2018.

Walter Plinge is also used as the name of a character in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s novel &quot;Maskerade&quot;, which is a parody of opera and musical theatre. The character is an amalgam of two parts played by Michael Crawford: Frank Spencer and the Phantom of the Opera.

<text>William Gordon Claxton DSO, DFC &amp; Bar (June 1, 1899 – September 28, 1967) was a Canadian World War I flying ace credited with 37 victories. He became the leading ace in his squadron.

==Background==

Born on June 1, 1899, in Gladstone, Manitoba, Claxton enlisted with the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in Canada upon his eighteenth birthday in 1917. After pilot&#x27;s training at Camp Borden, he was assigned to No. 41 Squadron in France the following March flying S.E.5a aircraft. Claxton arrived on the Western Front late in the war but he had a run of victories that saw him emerge from the war as his squadron&#x27;s most successful airman. He claimed 37 air victories in 79 days during the War&#x27;s final year. This meteoric career was marked by several multiple victory days. His calmness under fire earned him the nickname &quot;Dozy&quot;. It also led him into situations where his planes experienced battle damage. In June 1918 alone, he crash-landed once and brought home shot planes twice.

==Career as a fighter pilot==

Claxton opened his tally of &#x27;kills&#x27; on May 27, 1918, in the skies above East Estaires, downing a German Fokker Dr.I aircraft. The following day he brought down two Pfalz D.III aircraft.

Between June 12 and June 30, Claxton successfully downed 17 German aircraft plus an observation balloon. Thirteen of these planes fell in a four-day stretch, from June 27 through June 30. On June 30, alone he brought down six enemy aircraft. On that incredible day, he flamed a Pfalz D.II, destroyed two Albatros D.Vs, and drove another Pfalz D.III down out of control — all before lunch. In the afternoon, he destroyed yet another Pfalz D.III and shot a DFW C model down in flames.
By the end of July, he had increased his total to 27. On August 3, 1918, Claxton was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and appointed flight commander. By that time, his victory list had grown to 30.

On August 17, 1918, Claxton was shot down by Leutnant Johannes Gildemeister during an encounter with Jasta 20 in which he and fellow pilot Frederick McCall were outnumbered 20-to-1; by this time he had amassed 37 air successes. In this dogfight, he brought down three enemy planes before being hit. Claxton crash-landed behind enemy lines with a serious head wound and was only saved by prompt attendance of a German doctor, who performed cranial surgery.

Claxton&#x27;s final score was two observation balloons destroyed, 16 aircraft driven down out of control, and 19 aircraft destroyed. Two of the planes he destroyed were shared victories with 41 Squadron&#x27;s second ranking ace, Frederick McCall.

==Post war==

He remained a prisoner of war until the armistice. Claxton was repatriated on December 1, 1918. Returning to his homeland Claxton, who had received a Bar to his DFC and the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) took up a career as a financial journalist.

He died in Toronto on September 28, 1967, aged 68. He was cremated.

==Text of citations==

===Distinguished Flying Cross===
&quot;Lt. William Gordon Claxton.
This officer at all times shows fine courage and disregard of danger. He has accounted for six enemy aeroplanes and one kite balloon, three of the aeroplanes being destroyed and three driven down out of control. On a recent occasion, having destroyed a hostile balloon, he pursued an enemy scout ten miles and eventually drove it down; he was then attacked by five enemy triplanes and other scouts, but managed to return to our lines, though his machine was riddled with bullets.&quot;

===Distinguished Flying Cross - Bar===
&quot;Lieut. William Gordon Claxton, D.F.C.
This officer is conspicuous for his courage in attack. Recently in one day he destroyed six enemy aeroplanes—four in the morning and two in the evening. In thirteen days he accounted for fourteen machines. His utter disregard of danger inspires all who serve with him.&quot;

===Distinguished Service Order===
&quot;Lieut. William Gordon Claxton, D.F.C.
Between 4 July and 12 August this officer destroyed ten enemy aeroplanes and one kite balloon, making in all thirty machines and one &quot;kite balloon to his credit. Untiring in attack in the air or on the ground, this officer has rendered brilliant service.&quot;
