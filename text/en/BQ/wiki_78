<text>Robert Ridgway (July 2, 1850 – March 25, 1929) was an American ornithologist specializing in systematics. He was appointed in 1880 by Spencer Fullerton Baird, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to be the first full-time curator of birds at the United States National Museum, a title he held until his death. In 1883, he helped found the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, where he served as officer and journal editor. Ridgway was an outstanding descriptive taxonomist, capping his life work with &quot;The Birds of North and Middle America&quot; (eight volumes, 1901–1919). In his lifetime, he was unmatched in the number of North American bird species that he described for science. As technical illustrator, Ridgway used his own paintings and outline drawings to complement his writing. He also published two books that systematized color names for describing birds, &quot;A Nomenclature of Colors for Naturalists&quot; (1886) and &quot;Color Standards and Color Nomenclature&quot; (1912). Ornithologists all over the world continue to cite Ridgway&#x27;s color studies and books.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
Ridgway was born in Mount Carmel, Illinois to David and Henrietta (née Reed) Ridgway. He was the oldest of ten children. He was educated at common schools in his native town, where he showed a special fondness for natural history. This interest to explore nature, both shooting with a gun given to him by his father, as well as drawing from life, was encouraged by his parents, his uncle William, and his aunt Fannie Gunn.

In 1871 he met Julia Evelyn Perkins, the daughter of one of the engravers for &quot;The History of North American Birds.&quot; Ridgway&#x27;s courtship of the girl who became known as &quot;Evvie&quot; lasted until she reached the age of eighteen, and they were married on October 12, 1875.

===Ornithological training and the King expedition===
In 1864, at the age of thirteen, the young Ridgway wrote to the Commissioner of Patents, seeking advice on the identification of a bird he had seen. He enclosed a full-sized color drawing of what turned out to be a pair of purple finches. His letter eventually was referred to Spencer Fullerton Baird of the Smithsonian Institution. Baird replied, identifying the bird and praising the boy&#x27;s artistic abilities, yet cautioning him to learn and use the scientific names of birds in further correspondence.

The mentor and protégé continued their exchange of letters, which led to Ridgway&#x27;s appointment, in the spring of 1867, as the naturalist on Clarence King&#x27;s Survey of the 40th Parallel. After a brief, intensive stint of training in Washington, where he learned to prepare study skins, Ridgway joined the expedition in May. Starting from Sacramento, California, the team explored parts of Nevada, Utah Territory, and Idaho Territory. A highlight of the trip was a stop at Nevada&#x27;s Pyramid Lake. In the fall of 1868, the members of the team were reduced for funding reasons, but Ridgway returned in 1869 for more work in Utah. In an undertaking that lasted nearly two years, Ridgway collected 1,522 bird-related specimens (753 nests and eggs and 769 skins) and served as a key member on one of the four great surveys of the American West. He observed 262 species, most of these on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. He had written most of his portion of King&#x27;s report by 1872, but the &quot;Ornithology&quot; section was not published until 1877.

===The Washington years===

Upon his return to Washington, Ridgway illustrated and wrote for Baird and Thomas M. Brewer&#x27;s &quot;History of North American Birds&quot; project. He formally joined the Smithsonian in 1874, under the supervision of curator George Brown Goode. In 1880 he received the job title of curator (variously, of ornithology or of the department of birds); he was titled Curator of Birds from 1886 until his death. Working with the institution&#x27;s collection of approximately fifty thousand bird skins, Ridgway devoted himself to unraveling the taxonomic relationships among North American bird species. As well, he continued his field work to collect new specimens, making several trips to his home state of Illinois, Florida, other states of the U.S., and Costa Rica. The Smithsonian exchanged study skins with other museums, either by donation or loan, and provided material and publications to collectors such as José Castulo Zeledón of the Costa Rican National Museum in exchange for specimens.

Ridgway was articulate and literate, and served as the Smithsonian&#x27;s mouthpiece and representative for many years in the study of birds. He welcomed visits to the museum from colleagues and the general public alike, and would give tours. One of his responsibilities involved assembling public exhibits. In the interest of accessibility, he made books available for browsing and displayed examples of birds described in popular natural histories. As well, he showed birds from well-known poetry, species like the nightingale that are not found in North America. Returning the favor that Baird had paid him, he responded to letters from the public to identify birds and provided artist&#x27;s materials to a painter in California. Nevertheless, friends and colleagues described him as almost painfully shy, and he generally shirked publicity and the limelight.

Among Ridgway&#x27;s colleagues at the Smithsonian was Pierre Louis Jouy, who provided an important collection of Asian birds in 1883. Charles Wallace Richmond joined the institution in 1893 (at first, as a night watchman) and was soon tasked by Ridgway with writing reviews and other short pieces. During Samuel Pierpont Langley&#x27;s tenure as Secretary, Ridgway assisted Langley&#x27;s aviation research. He provided calculations of the wing loading and other aerodynamic characteristics of species like the wandering albatross, turkey vulture, and other soaring birds.

In 1883, Robert Ridgway was a founding member of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union (AOU) and he became an associate editor of the organization&#x27;s journal &quot;The Auk&quot;. He was prevailed upon to serve as an officer of the organization, but on the condition that he not be required to preside at public meetings. He served as a vice president of the AOU (September 1883 – November 1891) and as its president (November 1898 – November 1900).

As scientific knowledge expanded quickly in the second half of the nineteenth century, the need for reorganizing the system of names used to describe North American birds grew commensurately. For example, certain names assigned by William Bartram in his catalog of 1791 were now deemed unusable. Robert Ridgway addressed this need with two publications in 1880 and 1881, while Elliott Coues published a competing checklist in 1882. Ridgway and Coues, along with Joel Asaph Allen, William Brewster, and Henry W. Henshaw, came together as a committee on nomenclature and classification, serving the newly founded AOU, to reconcile the various systems and catalogs. In 1886, the committee released &quot;The Code of Nomenclature and Check-List of North American Birds&quot;, both a consistent checklist and a set of rules for the naming of birds to be described in the future. The Code settled the disagreement about capitalization of species names and established today&#x27;s order of presentation, with waterbirds first and passerines last. Several of the handbook&#x27;s innovations were adopted by other branches of zoology, and were incorporated into the 1905 version of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

The committee&#x27;s work served to standardize the way that birds are described, identifying them at the subspecies level and using a three-part trinomial name. While American ornithologists embraced the descriptive detail, European researchers of the time were reluctant to adopt it. Ridgway was an enthusiastic supporter of trinomial nomenclature, although his thinking in later life became more moderate.

===Other affiliations===
Robert Ridgway was a corresponding member of the Zoological Society of London; was associated with the Davenport (Iowa) Academy of Natural Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences, the Brookville, Indiana, Society of Natural History, and the Chicago Academy of Sciences; and was a foreign member of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union. He was a member of the permanent ornithological committee of the first international congress at Vienna in 1884. Ridgway was also honorary member of the Nuttall Ornithological Club of Cambridge, Massachusetts, for which he contributed illustrations and 48 articles to its &quot;Bulletin&quot;.

The short-lived Ridgway Ornithological Club of Chicago, Illinois (active from 1883 to about 1890) was named in Ridgway&#x27;s honor, and he was an honorary member.

Although he lacked formal post-secondary education, Ridgway received an honorary master&#x27;s degree in science from Indiana University in 1884, as a sign of gratitude for his supplying them with bird specimens after their museum burned down. He was listed with the title of Professor in Smithsonian annual reports and staff directories, despite his lack of a teaching appointment. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;Dr. Ridgway,&quot; particularly by writers from his home state of Illinois. Ella Dean&#x27;s profile is an example.

===The Harriman expedition===

In 1899, Robert Ridgway joined E. H. Harriman on his famous Harriman Alaska Expedition. John Muir, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, John Burroughs, Edward S. Curtis, and a number of other scientists and artists made a four-month expedition to study the flora and fauna of Alaska&#x27;s coastline. However, the trip did not yield significant publications by Ridgway.

===Other family members===
Robert and Julia Ridgway had one son, Audubon Whelock Ridgway (May 15, 1877 – February 22, 1901). &quot;Audie&quot; had begun a promising career in ornithology at the Field Museum of Natural History when his life was cut short by a fatal bout of pneumonia.

Robert Ridgway&#x27;s second-born brother, John Livzey Ridgway (February 28, 1859 – December 27, 1947), was a nationally prominent bird illustrator who worked for many years at the United States Geological Survey, as well as the Smithsonian, the California Institute of Technology, and the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science, and Art. The two brothers often collaborated on illustrations, sometimes with Robert doing the drawing and John the coloring.

===Later life and death===

In early June 1913, Robert Ridgway and his wife Julia (&quot;Evvie&quot;) moved to Olney, Illinois, to reduce physical and mental stress so that he might complete &quot;The Birds of North and Middle America&quot;, of which five of eight parts had already appeared. They built a new house on that they had purchased in 1906, and named the place Larchmound for two large larch trees growing on the property. Ridgway also acquired a tract of located in the country, to be called Bird Haven, which he developed as a private nature reserve for birds and as a nursery for cultivation of non-native plants. His skill in landscaping and tending to the grounds was such that his expertise in that area was in some demand. Bird Haven, in part, is now an Olney city park.

Evvie&#x27;s death on May 24, 1927, was a severe blow to Robert. Robert continued to live at Larchmound, tending to his beloved trees and shrubs, until his death on March 25, 1929, at the age of 78. Robert was buried at Bird Haven where Julia&#x27;s ashes had been scattered.

==Works==
Robert Ridgway&#x27;s first publication, at the age of 18, was an article about the belted kingfisher. In the course of the next 60 years, he would go on to publish more than 500 titles and 13,000 printed pages, most of it concerning North American birds.

Ridgway collaborated with Brewer and Baird on the five-volume &quot;History of North American Birds&quot; (three volumes on the land birds published in 1874, and two volumes published as &quot;The Water Birds of North America&quot; in 1884). In its time, the work was considered the standard work on North American ornithology. While Ridgway primarily contributed illustrations to the land bird volumes, he wrote the bulk of the water bird volumes.

Ridgway provided full-color illustrations for his own books and those of others. He was at the peak of his artistic proficiency in the late 1870s. Even though certain of his contemporaries (for instance, Daniel Giraud Elliot) may have produced more artistically pleasing renderings, Ridgway&#x27;s were the most accurate. In the words of his biographer Daniel Lewis, Ridgway &quot;may have had the best grasp of bird coloration in the country.&quot;

With the publication of &quot;A Manual of North American Birds&quot; in 1887, Robert Ridgway condensed what was known about the continent&#x27;s birds into a relatively compact 642 pages and 464 outline drawings. A prototype of today&#x27;s field guides, it was quite successful, going into a second edition in 1896, and was described by Montague Chamberlain as &quot;far away the best thing we have for the working naturalist.&quot; Nevertheless, its bulk was unwieldy for use in the field, and its identification keys depended on characteristics of the bird in the hand, not field marks. Harry Oberholser characterized the quality of the illustrations as &quot;rarely equaled, never excelled&quot; in beauty and accuracy.

With Stephen Alfred Forbes, he wrote a two-volume work, &quot;The Ornithology of Illinois&quot;. Ridgway&#x27;s contributions were published in two parts, in 1889 and 1895. Ridgway also published a number of papers dealing with the woody plants of his region. He contributed twenty short pieces to &quot;Forest and Stream&quot;, a magazine edited by George Bird Grinnell.

===The color books===
Robert Ridgway published two books whose goal was to standardize the names of colors used by ornithologists to describe birds. The first, &quot;A Nomenclature of Colors for Naturalists,&quot; appeared in 1886, and was relatively small in scope, illustrating 186 colors. It proposed a simple classification system, doing away with many subjective and evocative names that were currently popular.

Ridgway sought to improve and expand upon this work. By 1898, he was in discussions with Secretary Langley about a new, expanded dictionary of color, to be published by (or at least supported by) the Smithsonian. An advisory committee was formed, with scientific illustrator William Henry Holmes as chairman and Richard Rathbun (newly appointed assistant secretary) as one of its five members. Children&#x27;s game inventor Milton Bradley, who had devised a color wheel for instructional use, was consulted by the project. Langley thought it important that the work include spectral information about the colors to be cataloged, and he proposed physicist and color theorist Ogden Rood as a co-editor of the work. In 1901, however, the tension between the committee&#x27;s broad vision of commercial applications for the project and Ridgway&#x27;s narrow objective of a naturalist&#x27;s reference book ended the Ridgway-Smithsonian collaboration in the endeavor.

Ridgway published &quot;Color Standards and Color Nomenclature&quot; himself in 1912, financed in part by a loan from his friend and colleague Zeledón. The work became a standard reference used by ornithologists for decades after Ridgway&#x27;s death, as well as specialists in such wide-ranging fields as mycology, philately, and food coloring. The book named 1,115 colors, illustrated with painted samples reproduced on 53 plates. Special care was taken to ensure consistency of color reproduction across the edition, as well as the prevention of fading. The color samples were printed as large sheets by A. Hoen &amp; Co., cut into swatches one inch by one-and-one-half inches, and pasted into each bound book.

In the book&#x27;s foreword, Ridgway acknowledged the assistance of many, among them his brother John, Zeledón, and ornithologist John Thayer. With more than a thousand colors to be named, Ridgway devised some of his own imaginative identifiers (such as Dragons-blood Red and Pleroma Blue). He also paid tribute to colleagues, including Rood (with colors like Rood&#x27;s Lavender), Bradley (Bradley&#x27;s Blue), field guide pioneer Frank Chapman, watercolorist Samuel Prout, and others.

===Descriptions of new forms===
A significant proportion of Ridgway&#x27;s output consisted of formal scientific descriptions of new forms of birds (new genera, species, and subspecies), many of them native to Central and South America. Many of these papers were short reports dealing with a single taxon, but he also would describe tens of new forms in a single publication, as in a paper describing 22 species from the Galápagos Islands or his &quot;Manual of North American Birds&quot; (four new genera, 39 new species and subspecies). As subsequent research has revised the taxonomy of birds, not all of the forms that Ridgway described remain recognized as distinct, but his contributions are still substantial. During his lifetime, no other ornithologist described more new taxa of American birds than Ridgway.

While most of the forms described and named by Ridgway came from outside the United States, in one instance he identified a new taxon first collected no earlier than 1881, in the Catskill Mountains of New York, an area already well-explored by ornithologists. From two specimens collected by Eugene Bicknell, Ridgway wrote the description of Bicknell&#x27;s thrush as a subspecies of gray-cheeked thrush, naming it for Bicknell. The bird, a breeder of New England and southern Canada, has since been recognized as a distinct species.

From specimens collected in 1888, Ridgway was the first to describe hood mockingbird, Española cactus finch, &quot;Geospiza conirostris&quot;, and medium tree finch, all endemic to the Galápagos. The latter two are members of the so-called Darwin&#x27;s finch group of tanagers, significant for their impact on Charles Darwin&#x27;s reasoning about evolution and the emergence of new species.

===&quot;The Birds of North and Middle America&quot;===
Robert Ridgway&#x27;s career-crowning work, on bird systematics, was the monumental 6,000-page &quot;The Birds of North and Middle America,&quot; published by the Smithsonian in eleven volumes between 1901 and 1950. He began the work in 1894 at the direction of Goode. A major objective of the work was to resolve problems of naming and classification in the scientific literature of the time and to identify synonyms. Dry, rigorous, and technically detailed in its language, the book was not considered to be accessible by the general reading public. Continuing the pattern of the &quot;Manual&quot; (and Baird&#x27;s earlier &quot;Review of American Birds&quot;), each volume featured an appendix of engraved outline drawings of generic characteristics.

Ridgway published the eighth installment of the work, commonly known as &quot;Bulletin 50,&quot; in 1919. Although he continued to work on the project, outlining a projected two more volumes, it was incomplete at the time of his death in 1929. Following Ridgway&#x27;s plan but doing his own writing, Herbert Friedmann of the Smithsonian completed the final three volumes.

&quot;The Birds of North and Middle America&quot; and &quot;Color Standards and Color Nomenclature&quot; are complementary works, and indeed Ridgway divided his time between the two projects in the first decade of the century. He used his own color terms extensively throughout &quot;Bulletin 50&quot;.

==Legacy and recognition==
Spencer Fullerton Baird and his followers emphasized precision of description, traceability through the literature, the accumulation of empirical evidence (that is, numerous specimens), and deductions drawn from facts — in opposition to the so-called &quot;European school&quot; of the time, which depended on personal authority. Harris calls Robert Ridgway and his &quot;Birds of North and Middle America&quot; the culmination of the &quot;Bairdian school&quot; of bird study. However, as ornithology around the turn of the twentieth century began to focus on bird behavior, reproduction strategies, and other aspects of the living organism, Ridgway fell behind the advances made by his colleagues of the succeeding generations. Paradoxically, because the overwhelming &quot;Bulletin 50&quot; was so authoritative, no new publication could replace it for many years. Accordingly, systematics declined in importance as a means to study birds.

Birds named for Ridgway include the buff-collared nightjar, &quot;Caprimulgus ridgwayi&quot; (once known as Ridgway&#x27;s whip-poor-will); the turquoise cotinga, &quot;Cotinga ridgwayi&quot;; the Caribbean subspecies of the osprey, &quot;Pandion haliaetus ridgwayi&quot;; a Big Island subspecies of the elepaio, &quot;Chasiempis sandwichensis ridgwayi&quot;; Ridgway&#x27;s hawk, &quot;Buteo ridgwayi&quot;; Ridgway&#x27;s rail, &quot;Rallus obsoletus&quot;; Juniper Titmouse, &quot;Baeolophus ridgwayi;&quot; and many other species and subspecies. The monotypic genus &quot;Ridgwayia&quot; is named for him; it consists of Aztec thrush, &quot;R. pinicola&quot;.

In 1919, Ridgway was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences for his &quot;Birds of North and Middle America&quot;. The academy elected him to membership in 1926. In 1921, he was the first to receive the AOU&#x27;s William Brewster Memorial Award, which recognizes &quot;an exceptional body of work on birds of the Western Hemisphere.&quot;

The American Birding Association has established the Robert Ridgway Award for Publications in Field Ornithology, which recognizes professional achievements in field ornithology literature.

<doc id="504238" wikidata="Q1418928" url="?curid=504238" title="Silent Service (video game)">
<text>Silent Service is a submarine simulator video game designed by Sid Meier and published in 1985 by MicroProse for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, and IBM PC compatibles, then ported to other home computers. A Nintendo Entertainment System version developed by Rare was published in 1989 by Konami in Europe and by Konami&#x27;s Ultra Games subsidiary in North America. &quot;Silent Service II&quot; was released in 1990. Tommo purchased the rights to this game and published it online through its Retroism brand in 2015.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Silent Service&quot; is set in the Pacific Ocean during World War II, with the player assuming control of a U.S. &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine for various war patrols against Japanese shipping. &quot;Silent Service&quot; was a nickname for the US Navy&#x27;s submarine force in the Pacific during World War II. The player can choose when to attack from a range of realistic tactics, including the End Around and near invisibility at night (if the sub&#x27;s profile is kept to a minimum). It allows four projectiles concurrently, a challenge when battling multiple destroyers. Real-time is accelerated when not in combat.

Sid Meier described several key factors that influenced the design of the game: The size of the theater, the variety of tactical situations, and evolving technology, such as the use of surface radar and torpedoes that did or did not leave trails of bubbles on the surface—only simulations set after their real-life introduction had access to these. Tasks such as navigation, damage repair, and firing were compartmentalized into different screens to allow players access to a great deal of information, but also to focus on the immediate task.

==Development==
The game was designed by Sid Meier, the art which was made by Michael O. Haire. &quot;Silent Service&quot; was in development for eight months and its creation was inspired by a fractal technological trick. It was the first game for which Meier did not create the artwork; MicroProse cofounder Bill Stealey hired an illustrator whose work persuaded Meier that others&#x27; talent was superior.

==Reception==

&quot;Silent Service&quot; was MicroProse&#x27;s second best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. The company sold 250,000 copies by March 1987, and roughly 400,000 overall.

&quot;Info&quot; in 1985 rated &quot;Silent Service&quot; for the Commodore 64 four stars out of five, stating that its quality and graphics &quot;are all unmistakably MicroProse&quot; and &quot;ensure a satisfying level of play for any wargamer&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; wrote in 1986 that &quot;Sid Meier and his team of simulation experts at MicroProse have outdone themselves&quot;. The magazine approved of how the game offered both beginner modes and &quot;complex, historically accurate, and challenging war patrol scenarios&quot; for experts, and noted the Atari 8-bit version&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; graphics and &quot;well done&quot; manual&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; in 1987 also liked the Atari ST version&#x27;s graphics, sound, adjustable difficulty levels, and documentation, concluding: &quot;It&#x27;s a traditional MicroProse product and it&#x27;s nice to see that they&#x27;ve remained dedicated to detail&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; wrote in 1986 that &quot;like &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle&quot;, &quot;Silent Service&quot; is both intriguing and addictive... a superior product&quot;.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1986 called &quot;Silent Service&quot; &quot;easily the best [submarine simulator] for its simplicity of use and execution&quot;. It praised the game&#x27;s realism and only criticized the lack of a save game feature. Gregg Williams reviewed the Atari 8-bit home computer version, complimenting the graphics and sound and saying that they support the illusion of realism. A 1987 overview of World War II simulations rated the game five out of five stars, praising its &quot;superb graphics coupled with detailed rules, historical accuracy and layers of complexity&quot;. In 1993 a survey of wargames gave the game two stars out of five, stating that &quot;it has been rendered obsolete by time and superseded by &quot;Silent Service II&quot;&quot;. In 1996 the magazine ranked it as the 86th best game of all time, for having &quot;introduced the control-room interface for submarine games on variety of platforms&quot;.

&quot;Silent Service&quot; was awarded the Charles S. Roberts Award for &quot;Best Adventure Game for Home Computer of 1985&quot;.

<text>Serenity is a 2005 American space Western film written and directed by Joss Whedon in his feature directorial debut. The film is a continuation of Whedon&#x27;s short-lived 2002 Fox television series &quot;Firefly&quot; and stars the same cast, taking place after the events of the final episode. Set in 2517, &quot;Serenity&quot; is the story of the crew of &quot;Serenity&quot;, a &quot;&quot;Firefly&quot;-class&quot; spaceship. The captain and first mate are veterans of the Unification War, having fought on the losing Independent side against the Alliance. Their lives of smuggling and cargo-running are interrupted by a psychic passenger who harbors a dangerous secret.

The film stars Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau and Chiwetel Ejiofor. &quot;Serenity&quot; was released in North America on September 30, 2005, by Universal Pictures to generally positive reviews and several accolades, including the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the Prometheus Special Award and the Nebula Award for Best Script, but underperformed at the box office.

==Plot==
In the 26th century, humanity has colonized a new solar system. The central planets formed the Alliance and won a war against the outer planet Independents who resisted joining the Alliance. Child genius River Tam is conditioned by Alliance scientists into becoming a psychic and an assassin but is rescued as a teenager by her brother Dr. Simon Tam. During her training, River inadvertently read the minds of several top government officials and learned their secrets. Consequently, an Alliance agent known only as the Operative is tasked with recapturing her.

The siblings have found refuge aboard the transport spaceship &quot;Serenity&quot; with Captain Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Reynolds, first mate Zoe Washburne, her husband, pilot Hoban &quot;Wash&quot; Washburne, mercenary Jayne Cobb, and mechanic Kaylee Frye. Despite Simon&#x27;s objections, Mal brings River on a bank robbery. River warns them that savage and cannibalistic Reavers are coming. They escape, but Simon decides he and River will leave &quot;Serenity&quot; at the next port. Once there, however, a subliminal message in a television commercial causes River to attack numerous bar patrons, and Mal takes the siblings back aboard the ship. The crew contacts reclusive hacker Mr. Universe, who discovers the message designed to trigger River&#x27;s mental conditioning. He notes River whispered &quot;Miranda&quot; before attacking and warns that someone else has viewed the footage.

Mal receives an invitation from courtesan Inara Serra. Realising it is a trap, Mal goes to confront the Operative who promises to let him go free if he hands over River. Mal barely escapes. Miranda is discovered to be a planet located beyond a region of space swarming with Reavers. The crew flies to the planet Haven but find it devastated and their old friend Shepherd Book mortally wounded. The Operative promises to kill anyone who assists them until he gets River.

Mal has the crew disguise &quot;Serenity&quot; as a Reaver ship and they travel to Miranda undetected. They find its 30 million colonists dead, and a recording that explains an experimental chemical to suppress aggression had been added into Miranda&#x27;s atmosphere. The population became so docile they stopped performing all activities of daily living and placidly died. A small proportion of them had the opposite reaction and became insanely aggressive and violent. The Alliance had accidentally created the Reavers and this was the secret in River&#x27;s subconscious.

Mr. Universe agrees to broadcast the recording. However, the Operative kills him and prepares an ambush. Knowing this, the crew provoke the Reaver fleet into chasing them toward the Alliance armada. The Reavers and Alliance battle while Wash pilots &quot;Serenity&quot; through the crossfire. He crash lands near the broadcast tower before being fatally impaled by a Reaver spear.

The crew make a last stand against the Reavers to buy Mal time to broadcast the recording. The crew retreats behind a set of blast doors that fail to properly close. Simon is shot, and River dives through the doors to throw back Simon&#x27;s medical kit and close the doors before the Reavers drag her away. At the transmitter, Mal fights the Operative, finally subduing him and forcing him to watch as the recording is broadcast. Mal returns to the crew. The blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers. The Operative orders the Alliance troops to stand down.

The Operative provides medical aid and resources to repair &quot;Serenity.&quot; He tells Mal the broadcast has weakened the Alliance government, but while he will try to convince the Parliament that River and Simon are no longer threats, he warns that they may continue their pursuit in retribution for getting the word out. &quot;Serenity&quot; takes off, with River as Mal&#x27;s new pilot.

==Cast==


==Production==
===Development===
The film is based on &quot;Firefly&quot;, a television series canceled by the Fox Broadcasting Company in December 2002, after 11 of its 14 produced episodes had aired. Attempts to have other networks acquire the series failed, and creator Joss Whedon started to sell it as a film. He had been working on a film script since the show&#x27;s cancellation. Shortly after the cancellation, he contacted Barry Mendel, who was working with Universal Studios, and &quot;flat-out asked him&quot; for a way to continue the series as a film, including as a low-budget television film. Mendel introduced Whedon to then Universal executive Mary Parent. She had seen &quot;Firefly&quot; and immediately signed on to the project, even though Whedon had yet to create a story. Whedon remarked: 
In July 2003, Whedon said that though there was interest in the project, &quot;I won&#x27;t know really until I finish a draft whether or not it&#x27;s genuine.&quot; He felt that any film deal was contingent on keeping the show&#x27;s original cast, though he later stated that retaining the cast was &quot;never an issue&quot; as Universal executives believed the cast suitable after watching every episode of the series.

In early September 2004, a film deal with Universal was publicly confirmed. Universal acquired the rights to &quot;Firefly&quot; shortly before the confirmation. Whedon felt that the strong sales of the &quot;Firefly&quot; DVD, which sold out in less than 24 hours after the pre-order announcement, &quot;definitely helped light a fire and make them [Universal] go, &#x27;Okay, we&#x27;ve really got something here.&#x27; It definitely helped them just be comfortable with the decisions they were making, but they really had been supporting us for quite some time already.&quot; Whedon felt it was &quot;important people understand that the movie isn&#x27;t the series&quot;, and so the project was titled &quot;Serenity&quot;.

===Writing===
After Universal acquired the film rights from Fox, Whedon began writing the screenplay. His task was to explain the premise of a television series that few had seen without boring new viewers or longtime fans. He based his story on original story ideas for &quot;Firefly&quot;″s un-filmed second season. Whedon&#x27;s original script was 190 pages, and attempted to address all major plot points introduced in the series. After presenting the script to Barry Mendel under the title &quot;The Kitchen Sink&quot;, Whedon and Mendel collaborated on cutting down the script to a size film-able under his budget constraints. All nine principal cast members from the television series were scheduled to return for the movie, but Glass and Tudyk could not commit to sequels, leading to the death of their characters in the second draft of the script. The tightened script and a budget Mendel and Whedon prepared were submitted to Universal on a Friday and on the following Monday morning, Stacey Snider, then head of Universal, called Mendel to officially greenlight the movie.

Universal planned to begin shooting in October 2003, but delays in finishing the script postponed the start of shooting to June 2004.

===Filming===

Principal photography for &quot;Serenity&quot; was originally estimated to require 80 days, lasting a typical 12 to 14 hours each, with a budget of over $100 million. Unwilling to approve of such a large budget, Universal Studios wished to shoot abroad to minimize production costs. However, Whedon, reluctant to uproot his family, insisted that filming take place locally and maintained that it was possible for a local production to cost fewer days and less than half the expected budget. On March 2, 2004, the film was greenlit for production with a budget of under $40 million. At the project&#x27;s completion, the film spent $39 million, considered low for a science fiction action film featuring heavy special effects.

&quot;Serenity&quot; was filmed over a period of 50 ten-hour days, beginning June 3, 2004, and ending September 17, 2004. The film was primarily shot on Universal Studio sound stages with locations throughout Los Angeles. The sequence where the crew is pursued by Reavers after a bank robbery was filmed along the Templin Highway north of Santa Clarita. The shoot typically would have lasted 30 days, but the production completed filming the sequence in five days. Pyrotechnics were shot at Mystery Mesa, near Santa Clarita, over a period of three days rather than a typical two weeks. The scenes on the planet Miranda were filmed at Diamond Ranch High School in Pomona.

The production expected to save money by reusing the &quot;Serenity&quot; ship interior set from the &quot;Firefly&quot; television series, but the set was not available. Instead the ship was rebuilt, using DVD images of the television series as a guide. Construction was completed over 14 weeks on Universal Studios&#x27; Stage 12 by 23 supervised crews working independently but in coordination with one another. Universal was concerned about the extra cost but were satisfied when it was completed in just 14 weeks, according to executive producer David Lester.

===Visual effects===
As the budget for the film was considerably smaller than for the TV series, practical special effects were used as much as possible: if a computer-generated imagery (CGI) composite was required, as many tangible sets and props as possible were constructed to minimize the use of computer effects. The most technically challenging scene was the mule skiff chase. For budgetary reasons, a gimbal and CGI, much like those used in the pod race in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, were quickly ruled out. Instead, the crew fashioned a trailer with a cantilevered arm attached to the &quot;hovercraft&quot; and shot the scene while riding up Templin Highway north of Santa Clarita. Zoic Studios, the company that produced the graphics for the series, had to perform a complete overhaul of their computer model of &quot;Serenity&quot;, as the television model would not stand up to the high-definition scrutiny of cinema screens.

===Musical score===

In pre-production memos, Whedon described his vision for the score as &quot;spare, intimate, mournful and indefatigable&quot;. Just as the landscape and speech drew from elements of the Western, he wished the same of the musical style and instrumentation. However, he did not want to step too far into Western clichés to &quot;cause justified derision&quot; and hoped the score would also draw from Chinese and other Asian musical elements. He wanted the musical elements &quot;mixed up, hidden, or it&#x27;s as much a cliché as the western feel. We don&#x27;t want to be too specific about culture or time. We want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to let them take us out of the story, but not so comfortable that we begin to be told where the story is.&quot; Music was to draw heavily on what could be carried, and he highlighted four instruments: voice, percussion, woodwind, strings particularly guitar. He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be &quot;either too airy or too sophisticated&quot;.

Universal Studios wanted a composer with experience scoring films, ruling out &quot;Firefly&quot; composer Greg Edmonson. Whedon first thought of Carter Burwell, of whom Whedon was a huge fan. However, Whedon later felt that Burwell was not the right choice because as the film changed, the needs of the score changed as well. Burwell found working on the project difficult as it required he work &quot;opposite&quot; to his usual approach. The production would have continued with Burwell, but his other obligations left him little time to compose an entirely new score for &quot;Serenity&quot;. Burwell was dropped from the project a few weeks before the scheduled February 2005 recording.

David Newman was recommended by Universal&#x27;s music executives when Whedon requested a composer capable of &quot;everything&quot; and &quot;quickly&quot;. Whedon&#x27;s instructions to Newman for the ship &quot;Serenity&quot; theme was something homemade and mournful, evoking the idea of pioneers who had only what they could carry. Whedon wished the theme to let viewers know they were now home. River Tam&#x27;s theme was played on a uniquely shaped, square, antique piano that was slightly out of tune. The piano reminded Newman of River and composed a &quot;haunting, haunted, vaguely eastern and achingly unresolved&quot; theme that Whedon felt proved Newman&#x27;s understanding of the film&#x27;s musical needs.

The score was performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony under Newman&#x27;s direction. The official soundtrack was released September 27, 2005.

==Release==
&quot;Serenity&quot; had its world premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on August 22, 2005. The premiere sold out, and the festival arranged for two more screenings on August 24, which sold out in twenty-four hours, and in the &quot;Best of the Fest&quot; line-up on August 28. The film was theatrically released September 30, 2005.

&quot;Serenity&quot; was originally released on traditional film prints. Because the original 2K digital intermediate scans were readily available, the film was chosen by Universal Pictures to test conversion to a Digital Cinema Distribution Master of the film and to &quot;test the workflow required to create a .&quot; &quot;Serenity&quot; became the first film to fully conform to Digital Cinema Initiatives specifications, marking &quot;a major milestone in the move toward all-digital projection&quot;.

===Marketing===
In April 2005, Universal launched a three-stage grassroots marketing campaign. A rough cut of the film was previewed in a total of thirty-five North American cities where the &quot;Firefly&quot; television series received the highest Nielsen ratings. The screenings did not bear the name of the film and relied on word-of-mouth within the fanbase for promotion. All screenings sold out in less than twenty-four hours, sometimes in as quickly as five minutes. The first screening was held May 5, 2005, in ten cities. The second screening on May 26 increased the number of cities to twenty. In the twenty-four hours following the announcement of the second screening, the &quot;Firefly&quot; fanbase launched trial and error efforts to uncover the theaters holding the screenings, leading the event to be sold out before the official listing was released. The third screening on June 23 was held in thirty-five cities. A final screening was held at San Diego Comic-Con, followed by a panel with Whedon and the cast.

====Session 416 ====
Session 416, also known as the R. Tam Sessions, are a series of five short videos anonymously released by Whedon through various websites and message boards as viral marketing. The first video, bearing the title card &quot;R. Tam, Session 416, Second Excerpt&quot;, was released on the iFilm website on August 16, 2005. By September 7, 2005, all five videos had been released.

The series grew out of Universal executives&#x27; request that Whedon supply content for an online viral marketing campaign (though a representative from Universal Studios denied knowledge of the videos&#x27; origin). He decided to explore events before the film and the television series. The clips were filmed with a &quot;tiny&quot; crew in a single day and are shot in grainy, low quality, black-and-white. They were later included on the Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD.

The videos, sequenced out of chronological order, depict excerpts of counseling sessions between River Tam, played by Summer Glau, and her unnamed therapist, played by Whedon, while she is held at the Alliance Academy. They follow her change from shy and sweet child prodigy to the mentally unstable girl of the television series.

===Home media===
&quot;Serenity&quot; was released on Region 1 DVD, VHS and UMD on December 20, 2005. The DVD ranked #3 in sales for the week ending December 25, 2005. Bonus features on the DVD version include audio commentary from Whedon; deleted scenes and outtakes; a short introduction by Whedon for advance screenings; a hidden featurette on the creation of the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial; and three featurettes on the &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot; universe, special effects, and the revival of the television series to film. Region 2 releases included an additional making-of featurette, and Region 4 releases included additional extended scenes, a tour of the set, a feature on cinematographer Jack Green, and a question-and-answer session with Whedon filmed after an advance screening in Australia.

&quot;Serenity&quot; was released on HD DVD on April 18, 2006, the first Universal Studios film released on the format. In January 2007, it became the first full-resolution rip of an HD DVD release uploaded to the BitTorrent network after its title key was ripped from a software player and released online.

A 2-disc Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD was released for Region 1 on August 21, 2007. It included the special features on the Region 4 disc, except the question-and-answer session; Session 416, a documentary on the film; and a second commentary with Whedon and actors Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau, and Ron Glass. The film was released on Blu-ray on December 30, 2008, adding to the special features a video version of the cast commentary, picture-in-picture visual commentary, two databases of in-universe material, and a digital tour of &quot;Serenity&quot;. Serenity was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on October 17, 2017.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Despite high anticipation, &quot;Serenity&quot; performed poorly at the box office. Although several pundits predicted a #1 opening, the film opened at #2 in the United States, taking in $10.1 million on its first weekend, spending two weeks in the top ten, and closed on November 17, 2005 with a domestic box office gross of $25.5 million. Movie industry analyst Brandon Gray described &quot;Serenity&quot;″s box office performance as &quot;like a below average genre picture&quot;.

&quot;Serenity&quot;″s international box office results were mixed, with strong openings in the UK, Portugal and Russia, but poor results in Spain, Australia, France and Italy. United International Pictures canceled the film&#x27;s theatrical release in at least seven countries, planning to release it directly to DVD instead. The box office income outside the United States was $14.9 million, with a worldwide total of $40.4 million.

===Critical reception===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 187 reviews, with an average rating of 7.15/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Snappy dialogue and goofy characters make this Wild Wild West soap opera in space fun and adventurous.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Ebert and Roeper gave the film a &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot; rating. Roger Ebert, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film three out of four stars, commenting that it is &quot;made of dubious but energetic special effects, breathless velocity, much imagination, some sly verbal wit and a little political satire&quot;. &quot;The movie plays like a critique of contemporary society&quot;, he observed, also stating that in this way it was like &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Peter Hartlaub in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;a triumph&quot;, comparing its writing to the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as a modest but superior science fiction film. Science fiction author Orson Scott Card called &quot;Serenity&quot; &quot;the best science fiction film ever&quot;, further stating &quot;If &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; can&#x27;t be this kind of movie, and this good a movie, then I want it never to be made. I&#x27;d rather just watch &quot;Serenity&quot; again.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot; film critic Claudia Puig wrote that &quot;the characters are generally uninteresting and one-dimensional, and the futuristic Western-style plot grows tedious&quot;. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; declared that the film &quot;bounces around to sometimes memorable effect but rarely soars&quot;.

===Awards===
&quot;Serenity&quot; won several awards after its release. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation—Long Form, the Nebula Award for Best Script, and the Prometheus Special Award. The film was also named film of the year by &quot;Film 2005&quot; and FilmFocus, and it was determined by &quot;SFX&quot; magazine to be the best science fiction movie of all time in 2007. IGN Film awarded &quot;Serenity&quot; Best Sci-Fi, Best Story, and Best Trailer for the year, and it won second for Overall Best Movie after &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. The SyFy Genre Awards awarded it runner-up in the categories for Best Movie, Best Actor in a film (Nathan Fillion), and Best Actress in a film (Summer Glau), losing in all categories to &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. &quot;Serenity&quot; later ranked 383 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Films of All Time and 90 of the 301 Greatest Movies of All Time as voted by the magazine&#x27;s readers.

===Cultural impact===
NASA astronaut Steven Swanson, an ardent fan of the series, took the Region 1 &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot; DVDs with him on Space Shuttle Atlantis&#x27; STS-117 mission, which lifted off on Friday June 8, 2007, to be added to the ISS entertainment library.

On February 20, 2009, NASA announced an online poll to name Node 3 of the ISS; NASA-suggested options included Earthrise, Legacy, Serenity, and Venture. At the March 20, 2009 poll close, &#x27;Serenity&#x27; led those four choices with 70% of the vote. In the end, the poll was discarded and the node was named &#x27;Tranquility&#x27;.

====Charity screenings====
Beginning in January 2006, fans (with Universal&#x27;s blessing) began organizing charity screenings of &quot;Serenity&quot; to benefit Equality Now, a human rights organization supported by Joss Whedon. By mid-June, 41 such screenings had been confirmed for cities in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and United States, and as of June 19, 2006, there were 47 scheduled screenings. The project was referred to as &quot;Serenity Now/Equality Now&quot; on the official website, but was often referred to in shortened form as &quot;Serenity Now&quot;, and was coordinated through &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop The Serenity&quot;. The name officially changed in 2007 to Can&#x27;t Stop The Serenity (CSTS)

This has become a multi-venue event held each calendar year in various countries and cities and on various dates throughout the year. Funds raised by the events go to Equality Now (and other charities).

=== Comics ===

Universal Studios wanted to do an animated prequel to the &quot;Serenity&quot; film, but after Whedon and Brett Matthews wrote a story, Universal scuttled the project. The story was rewritten into a three-issue comic book miniseries intended to bridge the gap between the television series and the film. &quot;&quot; was released from July through September 2005 by Dark Horse Comics.

After &quot;Those Left Behind&quot;, other comics of the series were also published.

=== Books ===
A novelization of the film was written by Keith DeCandido and published by Simon &amp; Schuster under their Pocket Star imprint on August 30, 2005. Titan Publishing published &quot;Serenity: The Official Visual Companion&quot; on September 1, 2005, and Titan Magazines released a one-shot souvenir magazine. Margaret Weis Productions released the &quot;Serenity&quot; tabletop role-playing game based on the film on September 19, 2005.

=== Trading card set and action figures ===
Inkworks issued a 72-card trading card set, including autographed cards and cards with swatches of costumes used in the film, on September 21, 2005. The set won Diamond Comics&#x27; 2005 Non-Sports Card Product of the Year Gem Award. Diamond Select Toys released five six-inch action figures initially featuring Malcolm Reynolds, Jayne Cobb, and a Reaver, later adding River Tam, Inara Serra, and Zoe Washburne. The line was deemed to be &quot;disappointing&quot; with the figure of Malcolm Reynolds particularly singled out; both won MWCToys&#x27; silver award for Worst Line and Worst Male Figure under twelve inches for 2005.

==Themes and cultural allusions==
While the film depicts the Alliance as an all-powerful, authoritarian-style regime, Whedon states it is not so simple. &quot;The Alliance isn&#x27;t some evil empire&quot;, he explains, but rather a largely benevolent bureaucratic force. The Alliance&#x27;s main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone, regardless of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not. What the crew of &quot;Serenity&quot; represent—specifically Mal and his lifestyle—is the idea that people should have the right to make their own decisions, even if those decisions are bad.

The Operative embodies the Alliance and is, as Whedon describes, the &quot;perfect product of what&#x27;s wrong with the Alliance&quot;. He is someone whose motives are to achieve a good end, a &quot;world without sin&quot;. The Operative believes so strongly in this idea that he willingly compromises his humanity in furtherance of it—as he himself admits, he would have no place in this world. In contrast, Mal is, at the movie&#x27;s beginning, a man who has lost all faith. By the movie&#x27;s ending, Mal has finally come to believe so strongly in something—individual liberty—that he becomes willing to lay down his life to preserve it.

Whedon has said that the most important line spoken in the film is when Mal forces the Operative to watch the Miranda footage at the climax of the film, promising him: &quot;I&#x27;m going to show you a world without sin&quot;. Whedon makes the point that a world without sin is a world without choice, and that choice is ultimately what defines humanity. According to Whedon, the planet &quot;Miranda&quot; was named for William Shakespeare&#x27;s Miranda in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, who in Act V, scene I says: &quot;O brave new world, / That has such people in&#x27;t!&quot; A spaceship found on the planet Miranda carries the codename &quot;C57D&quot;, a reference to the flying saucer in the 1956 film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. The plot to &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is based on &quot;The Tempest&quot; and, like &quot;Serenity&quot;, features a character struggling with his subconscious. The Alliance had hoped that Miranda would be a new kind of world, filled with peaceful, happy people, and represents the &quot;inane optimism of the Alliance&quot;.

The Fruity Oaty Bar commercial shown in the Maidenhead spaceport bar, which carried the subliminal message that triggered River Tam, is partially inspired by Mr. Sparkle, the mascot of a fictional brand of dish-washing detergent, who was featured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;In Marge We Trust&quot;. Whedon mentions in a DVD feature that when the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial was being designed, he constantly asked the animators to redesign it and make it even &quot;more&quot; bizarre than the previous design, until it arrived at the version presented on screen.

==Canceled sequel==
Fans had hoped that if &quot;Serenity&quot; had been successful, it might lead to either a sequel or a film trilogy.

The first major sequel rumor began on December 1, 2005, when IGN Filmforce reported that Universal had expressed an interest in making a &quot;Serenity&quot; television movie for broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel. It was expected that commissioning of a television sequel would be contingent on strong DVD sales of &quot;Serenity&quot;. In a January 2006 interview, Whedon doubted the chances of a sequel. On October 1, 2006, Whedon posted a comment to the Whedonesque.com website, debunking a rumor that he was working on a sequel.

In an interview at the 2007 Comic-Con, Whedon stated that he believes hope for a sequel rests in the sales of the Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD. In an August 2007 interview with Amazon.com prior to the Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD release, Whedon stated, &quot;It&#x27;s still on my mind, I mean, but I don&#x27;t know if mine is the only mind that it&#x27;s on.&quot; He later said, &quot;You know, whether or not &quot;anybody&quot; who&#x27;s involved would be available at that point—everybody&#x27;s working, I&#x27;m happy to say—is a question, but whether I would want to do another one is not a question.&quot;

<text>Flotsam and Jetsam is an American thrash metal band that was formed in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1981. Before settling on its current name in 1984, the band had existed under three different names, Paradox, Dredlox and Dogz. Their current lineup includes vocalist Eric &quot;A.K&quot; Knutson, guitarists Michael Gilbert and Steve Conley, bassist Bill Bodily, and drummer Ken Mary. Flotsam and Jetsam went through several lineup changes over the years, leaving Knutson as the only constant member. They are also notable for featuring a then-unknown Jason Newsted, who was Flotsam and Jetsam&#x27;s bassist from 1981 to 1986, when he left the band shortly after the release of their debut album to join Metallica.

Flotsam and Jetsam has released fifteen studio albums in their career, with the latest being 2024&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Weapon&quot;. The band emerged as part of the second wave of thrash metal during the mid-to-late 1980s (along with Sepultura, Testament and Death Angel), and achieved moderate success with the albums &quot;No Place for Disgrace&quot; (1988), &quot;When the Storm Comes Down&quot; (1990) and &quot;Cuatro&quot; (1992), with the first two entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the latter cracking the top 30 on the Heatseekers chart.

== Band history ==
=== 1981–1986: Early days ===
The group was founded in 1981 under the name Paradox by drummer Kelly David-Smith and guitarists Pete Mello and Dave Goulder, who were later joined by bassist Jason Newsted. Newsted had answered an advertisement that David-Smith had placed in the local newspaper, looking for a bass player. Newsted came to Phoenix with his band Gangster, from Michigan, on their way to California, but Gangster broke up while in Phoenix. David-Smith got a call from a couple of his high school friends, Mark Vasquez and Kevin Horton, looking for some people to jam with playing covers of bands such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, MSG, and UFO. The band then morphed into Dredlox together with the new recruits, and Newsted was now the main vocalist.

David-Smith saw &quot;A.K.&quot; (Eric A. Knutson) singing &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; at his high school talent show. In 1982, they were in the same summer school class and David-Smith asked Knutson if he wanted to audition. They put him on two-week probation and he later joined the band. Due to the provisional nature of his membership, the band referred to Knutson as &quot;the 2 weeker&quot;. Ed Carlson, from another local rival band called Exodus (not to be confused with the San Francisco Bay Area thrash metal band of the same name), also joined in 1983, after Horton&#x27;s departure from the band. The name of the band changed into The Dogz, but it did not last long. Eventually the band renamed itself &quot;Flotsam and Jetsam&quot;, after writing a song inspired by a chapter (Book III, chapter 9) from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which bore the same name.

The band made its live debut in local clubs and in California and had the opportunity to play with bands such as Megadeth, Armored Saint, Alcatrazz, Malice, Exciter, Mercyful Fate, Riot, Autograph and Icon. In 1985, Mark Vasquez stepped out and then-17-year-old Michael Gilbert joined the band. Flotsam and Jetsam released two demo tapes &quot;Iron Tears&quot; and &quot;Metal Shock&quot; that same year.

They created their first video &quot;Hammerhead&quot; from the &quot;Metal Shock&quot; demo: &quot;We taped it in Jason and Ed&#x27;s apartment living room. We also made a live video at the infamous Bootlegger in Phoenix&quot; (owned by Gloria Cavalera, currently married to Max Cavalera). These videos and the band&#x27;s demos made a good impression on record labels. After the band contributed to the &quot;Speed Metal Hell II&quot; and &quot;Metal Massacre VII&quot; compilations, they then signed a deal with Metal Blade Records.

=== 1986–1989: &quot;Doomsday for the Deceiver&quot; and &quot;No Place for Disgrace&quot; ===
Flotsam and Jetsam recorded their debut album &quot;Doomsday for the Deceiver&quot; in Los Angeles, with producer Brian Slagel and engineer Bill Metoyer. The album was released on July 4, 1986, and was the first in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s history to achieve the 6K rating.

Newsted, who was also the band&#x27;s main lyric writer, departed soon after to join Metallica, replacing their bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a bus accident. On Halloween night 1986, he played his last gig with Flotsam and Jetsam. The band had asked another local bassist Phil Rind of Sacred Reich to fill in for a short time. They then hired Michael Spencer from the Sacramento band Sentinel Beast. Flotsam and Jetsam signed a deal with Metallica&#x27;s then-label Elektra Records before opening for Megadeth in 1987 on the &quot;Peace Sells&quot; tour in Europe and North America. After touring with Megadeth, the band played selected shows in America with Slayer, Dark Angel, Possessed, Celtic Frost, Sacred Reich and Excel.

Michael Spencer left Flotsam and Jetsam shortly after a U.S. tour in the fall of 1987; his replacement was Troy Gregory. Their second studio album, &quot;No Place for Disgrace&quot;, was released in May 1988, and includes a cover of Elton John&#x27;s hit &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot;, for which a music video was shot. The band toured heavily behind &quot;No Place for Disgrace&quot; throughout 1988 and 1989. They opened for King Diamond in North America, and supported Megadeth, Testament and Sanctuary in Europe on the &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; tour. The band also toured or played shows with Testament, The Crumbsuckers, Fates Warning, Destruction, Metal Church, Death Angel, D.R.I., Acid Reign and Kreator, and landed a billing for festivals, such as Milwaukee Metalfest, and played at Aardschokdag twice (in May 1988 and April 1989).

=== 1989–1995: MCA era ===
In 1989, Flotsam and Jetsam were signed to MCA Records and began work on their third album &quot;When the Storm Comes Down&quot;, which was released in May 1990. The band expected to gain recognition with this album, but it suffered from a variety of mixed reviews. A video made for &quot;Suffer the Masses&quot; did however receive heavy rotation on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. Musically and lyrically, &quot;When the Storm Comes Down&quot; marked the beginning of at least two changes for Flotsam and Jetsam: it mirrored much of the occult and dark themes evidenced in the lyrical content of their previous two albums, instead focusing on politics and society in general, and saw the band expanding their thrash roots and using elements of the progressive and technical style of their later albums. The band toured for about a year and a half in support of &quot;When the Storm Comes Down&quot;; they co-headlined a U.S. tour with Prong, and subsequently toured or played selected shows with bands such as Testament, Savatage, Exodus, Vio-Lence, Sacred Reich, Wrathchild America and then-unknown Pantera.

Shortly after the &quot;When the Storm Comes Down&quot; tour ended, bassist Troy Gregory departed to join Prong. Holding auditions in Phoenix, the band hired Jason Ward to fill the role. With Ward as their new bassist, Flotsam and Jetsam released their fourth album &quot;Cuatro&quot; in October 1992. It marked an evolution in style and songwriting, moving from thrash to a slower, slightly more, melodic sound, while also continuing the progressive and technical song structures used on &quot;When the Storm Comes Down&quot;. The band released four singles this time, two of which (&quot;Swatting at Flies&quot; and &quot;Wading Through the Darkness&quot;) were shot as music videos and both received regular rotation on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. Flotsam and Jetsam promoted &quot;Cuatro&quot; with a year-long tour, playing with bands like Body Count, Sepultura, Testament, White Zombie, Nudeswirl and Damn the Machine, as well as doing a US tour with Mercyful Fate, Cathedral and Anacrusis.

Slowing down after the moderate success of their previous albums, it took nearly three years until Flotsam and Jetsam released their fifth album &quot;Drift&quot; in April 1995, which was dedicated to Jason&#x27;s older brother Jeff Ward, former drummer of such bands as Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Revolting Cocks and Lard, who died in 1993. Three singles were released off of the record, and one of them (&quot;Smoked Out&quot;) had a music video. However, with &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; already off the air in the U.S., and many heavy metal radio stations changing formats, &quot;Drift&quot; did not sell as well as the band&#x27;s previous albums, and about the same time they toured the U.S. with Megadeth and Korn during the summer of 1995, MCA&#x27;s six-year relationship with Flotsam and Jetsam had ended.

=== 1996–2001: Return to Metal Blade ===
After taking a break in most of 1996 and resigning from MCA to Metal Blade, Flotsam and Jetsam resurfaced in 1997 with their sixth album &quot;High&quot;. The album&#x27;s song titles were designed with the font types/logos of famous bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Kiss, Van Halen, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Misfits, etc. to pay homage to those whom came before and inspired the band while it was coming up the ranks. The music was more experimental than before, and the album also featured the Lard cover song &quot;Fork Boy&quot;. Music video was released, &quot;Monster&quot; to follow-up.

Michael Gilbert and Kelly Smith left the band after the release and were replaced by guitarist Mark Simpson and drummer Craig Nielsen (at the suggestion of then-Megadeth drummer Nick Menza). With the new line-up Flotsam and Jetsam toured in Europe together with Anvil and Exciter.

&quot;Unnatural Selection&quot; was released in 1999 and Mark Simpson took a short break. He joined the band again in 2000 to record a new album, &quot;My God&quot; released in May 2001. At that time Eric A.K. had founded a country band, the A.K. Corral. He left the band for a short time to take a break from Metal and pursue his side project. (AK) &quot;I had given Metal my life for a solid 15 years, I took some time to explore other musical flavors&quot;. Though Flotsam and Jetsam did not disband, there was a long break at that time. They found a new singer, James Rivera, who took over vocal duties live. Later the band felt that no one other than Eric A.K. could be their singer and Rivera left the band soon after.

=== 2002–2010: &quot;Live in Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Dreams of Death&quot; and &quot;The Cold&quot; ===

During 2002 and 2003, the band were active only sporadically, but Eric A.K. rejoined for live dates in the Phoenix and Los Angeles areas in 2003. Tory Edwards was a guest for this tour. A live recording of these shows was released in 2004 as a live concert DVD under the title &quot;Live in Phoenix&quot;. Signed to the Crash Music label in May 2004 and with Eric A.K. joining the band again officially, they hit the road with Overkill and Death Angel for a series of sold-out concerts in Japan.

Spring 2005 Flotsam and Jetsam returned to the studio to work on their new album. The lyrics were mostly inspired by Eric&#x27;s nightmares. This resulted into a concept album entitled &quot;Dreams of Death&quot; – like track 2 of &quot;No Place for Disgrace&quot;. The album was released July 2005.

The live DVD &quot;Live in Japan&quot; was released in February 2006 and shows their concert in front of hundreds of screaming Japanese fans at the Citta Club in Tokyo 2004.

&quot;Doomsday for the Deceiver&quot; was re-released in November 2006 by Metal Blade Records to celebrate the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary. This set (two CDs and one DVD) includes the original recording of Doomsday and a re-mixed and re-mastered(Digitized)version and also the two Flotsam and Jetsam demos. The bonus DVD includes rare live material, an interview filmed at David-Smith&#x27;s High School and a photo slide-show.

In March 2008, Flotsam and Jetsam toured in Europe and played at the Metalmania Festival in Poland. This show was filmed and released as DVD &quot;Once in a Deathtime&quot; in July. In mid-2008 the band were signed to Driven Music Group, founded by former KORN guitarist Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch.

After a tour in Europe with support act Neurasthenia in April 2010 Flotsam and Jetsam finished their album &quot;The Cold&quot;. It was released on September 14, 2010. It was the last album with Mark Simpson on guitar. He left the band in friendship and was replaced by returning guitarist Ed Carlson, who had quit the band in March 2010, to be replaced by Michael Gilbert.

=== 2011–2013: &quot;Ugly Noise&quot; ===
On September 19, 2011, Flotsam and Jetsam announced they had parted ways with Craig Nielson and reunited with founding drummer David-Smith. The band also announced a crowdfunding campaign on PledgeMusic to fund the recording of their next studio album.

On June 13, 2012, the band announced &quot;Ugly Noise&quot; as the title of the next album. In July, guitarist Michael Gilbert said the album would feature songwriting contributions from former bassist Jason Newsted. The album was released on December 21, 2012.

After tracking, Jason Ward was no longer able to commit to touring with the band any further due to his current personal commitments. He was replaced by Michael Spencer, who had previously replaced Newsted in 1986.

During the tour, Edward Carlson started to have extreme physical pain in his lower back and numbness in his right arm. After the tour, an MRI revealed that he had bulging disks in his upper and lower back causing the dysfunction to occur. Flotsam and Jetsam then recruited guitarist Steve Conley of F5 to step in while they finished out their live commitments.

=== 2013–2014: &quot;No Place For Disgrace 2014&quot; ===
&quot;No Place For Disgrace 2014&quot; featured guest musicians Mark Simpson, Chris Poland and Tory Edwards. In June 2013, the band headlined at the Warriors of Metal Festival in Columbus Ohio.

Flotsam and Jetsam embarked on a 29-date European tour with Sepultura, Legion of the Damned and Mortillery. The tour kicked off on February 7, 2014, in Bochum, Germany.

Flotsam toured Europe 4 times in 2014 with a total of 40 shows in all. Returning home from Europe on August 11, the band planned to start writing for a new release in 2015. Michael Spencer and Steve Conley would be involved this time in the process. Spencer had written some material previously in 1987 that he took with him after his departure. Flotsam used at some of the archive material from Spencer.

=== 2014–2021: &quot;Flotsam and Jetsam&quot;, &quot;The End of Chaos&quot; and &quot;Blood in the Water&quot; ===
In December 2014, drummer and founding member, David-Smith decided to leave the band due to unexpected family matters that required him to be home with his family. Handpicked by Smith to replace him on drums, was longtime friend and Shadows Fall drummer Jason Bittner. Bittner was present on Flotsam and Jetsam&#x27;s self-titled twelfth studio album, which was released on May 20, 2016. The band did a world tour to support this album, including Europe with Destruction, Enforcer and Nervosa, North America with Helstar and Hatchet, and then back to Europe with Dew-Scented and Izegrim. They also opened for HammerFall on their spring/summer 2018 North American tour.

On July 6, 2017, it was announced that Flotsam and Jetsam were replacing Bittner (who had just joined Overkill) with Ken Mary (Fifth Angel, Alice Cooper, House of Lords, TKO, Chastain, Impellitteri), and that they had begun working on their thirteenth studio album &quot;The End of Chaos&quot;, which was initially reported to be released in November 2018; however, the album&#x27;s release date was pushed back to January 18, 2019. In support of &quot;The End of Chaos&quot;, Flotsam and Jetsam (along with Destruction and Meshiaak) opened for Overkill on the European Killfest Tour in March 2019. A headlining US tour, titled Demolition of North America, was scheduled to take place in the spring of 2020, but it was postponed and then cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Less than a month after the release of &quot;The End of Chaos&quot;, frontman Eric &quot;A.K.&quot; Knutson stated in an interview with Jesse Capps of Loudist that Flotsam and Jetsam would &quot;probably start writing and recording&quot; a follow-up album in November 2019.

On November 13, 2020, the band announced Bill Bodily had replaced Michael Spencer as their new bassist, and that the final mixes for their upcoming album were almost finished.

On April 1, 2021, Flotsam and Jetsam announced &quot;Blood in the Water&quot; as the title of their fourteenth studio album and June 4 as its release date. A week later, the band released a music video for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Burn the Sky&quot;. Flotsam and Jetsam promoted &quot;Blood in the Water&quot; with a headlining US tour, and they were slated to open for Accept on the European trek of their &quot;Too Mean to Die&quot; tour in January and February 2022 (along with Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons), but &quot;many factors&quot; prompted the band to withdraw from the tour. Flotsam and Jetsam did, however, tour Europe in June 2022 as a headlining act.

=== 2021–present: &quot;I Am the Weapon&quot; ===
In an interview with AZ Central on June 5, 2021, the day after the release of &quot;Blood in the Water&quot;, frontman Eric &quot;A.K.&quot; Knutson mentioned a follow-up album, revealing that he &quot;probably [has] enough songs that didn&#x27;t make it on the last two records to do two more records&quot;.

On April 26, 2024, Flotsam and Jetsam released &quot;I Am the Weapon&quot; as the first single from their upcoming fifteenth studio album of the same name. On May 31, 2024, a music video for the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Primal&quot; was released, and on the same day, the band announced that &quot;I Am the Weapon&quot; would be released on September 13.

<text>The term Listserv (styled by the registered trademark licensee, L-Soft International, Inc., as LISTSERV) has been used to refer to electronic mailing list software applications in general, but is more properly applied to a few early instances of such software, which allows a sender to send one email to a list, which then transparently sends it on to the addresses of the subscribers to the list.

The original Listserv software, the Bitnic Listserv (also known as BITNIC LISTSERV) (1984–1986), allowed mailing lists to be implemented on IBM VM mainframes and was developed by Ira Fuchs, Daniel Oberst, and Ricky Hernandez in 1984. This mailing list service was known as Listserv@Bitnic (also known as LISTSERV@BITNIC) and quickly became a key service on the BITNET network. It provided functionality similar to a UNIX Sendmail alias and, as with Sendmail, subscriptions were managed manually.

In 1986, Éric Thomas developed an independent application, originally named &quot;Revised Listserv&quot; (also known as &quot;Revised LISTSERV&quot;), which was the first automated mailing list management application. Prior to Revised Listserv, email lists were managed manually. To join or leave a list, people would write to a list administrator and ask to be added or removed, a process that became more time-consuming as discussion lists grew in popularity.

By 1987, the users of the Bitnic Listserv had migrated to Thomas&#x27; version.

Listserv was freeware from 1986 through 1993 and is now a commercial product developed by L-Soft, a company founded by Thomas in 1994. A free version limited to ten lists of up to 500 subscribers each can be downloaded from the company&#x27;s web site.

Several other list-management tools were subsequently developed, such as Lyris ListManager in 1997 (now Aurea Email Marketing), Sympa in 1997, GNU Mailman in 1998, and Gaggle in 2015.

== Automated mailing list management ==
In 1986, Éric Thomas developed the concept of an automated mailing list manager. Whilst a student at École Centrale Paris, he developed the software now known as LISTSERV. Some of the early software features allowed joining or leaving a list without the need for human administration. The list owner could also add or remove subscribers, and edit templates for both welcome and system messages. Amongst other innovations LISTSERV introduced double opt-in in 1993 and the first spam filter in 1995.

After the release of Thomas&#x27; LISTSERV in 1986, LISTSERV@BITNIC was enhanced to provide automatic list management, but this enhancement was abandoned a few months later when Bitnic installed Thomas&#x27; LISTSERV.

Other than their name, Bitnic&#x27;s and Thomas&#x27; products are unrelated and neither product is based on the other product&#x27;s code.

Though electronic mailing lists (also known as &quot;email lists&quot;) are not as popular as they once were, they survive due to their ease of use.

== Trademark ==
LISTSERV was registered as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 1995, based on its use since 1986. It was registered with the Swedish Patent and Registration Office, PRV, in 2001. As such, in those jurisdictions, using the word &quot;listserv&quot; to describe a different product or as a generic term for any email-based mailing list of that kind is a trademark misuse. The standard generic terms are &quot;electronic mailing list&quot;, , or &quot;email list&quot; for the list itself, and &quot;email list manager&quot; or &quot;email list software&quot; for the software product that manages the list. Nevertheless, the generic use of the term has been common at times.

== Security ==
Individual user passwords were stored in plaintext until version 15.0. This made them available to users who are listed as &quot;Site Managers&quot; or &quot;Postmasters&quot; in the application configuration. Storing passwords in plaintext has the potential to allow anyone with access to the site, including attackers who might have compromised the site, to read the credentials. With the 2007 release of version 15.5, passwords are now stored hashed to defend against this attack.

== Editions ==
LISTSERV is available in several licensing options: LISTSERV Lite Free Edition for non-commercial hobby use; LISTSERV Lite for smaller workloads; LISTSERV, the standard, full-featured version; LISTSERV HPO (High Performance Option); and LISTSERV Maestro (for customized and targeted email publishing and reporting).

<doc id="504262" wikidata="Q564316" url="?curid=504262" title="2004 Malaysian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Malaysia on Sunday, 21 March 2004. Voting took place in all 219 parliamentary constituencies, each electing one Member of Parliament to the Dewan Rakyat, the dominant house of Parliament. They were the first elections for Abdullah Ahmad Badawi as Prime Minister following his appointment in 2003. State elections also took place in 505 state constituencies in twelve of the thirteen states (except Sarawak) on the same day, which also marked the first time Sabah held its state election parallel with the other states of Peninsular Malaysia.

The result was a victory for the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which received 64% of the vote (and would have gained a higher vote had all seats been contested) and won 198 seats to the combined opposition parties&#x27; 20 seats, with one independent. This was the largest majority that BN had won since the 1978. The dominant party in BN, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), won 109 seats, a gain of 37. UMNO&#x27;s allies also gained seats; the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) won 31 seats, a gain of two, and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) won nine seats, a gain of two.

The Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) managed to retain only seven of its 27 seats. PAS ran on a platform promising an Islamic state, which turned off many moderate voters. In addition, the PAS leader, Abdul Hadi Awang, lost his parliamentary seat. Another opposition party, the People&#x27;s Justice Party (PKR), lost four of its five seats. After five recounts, the party&#x27;s leader, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail (the wife of imprisoned former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim), retained her seat with a majority of just 590 votes.

The third opposition party, the Democratic Action Party (DAP), which was routed in the 1999 elections, improved its performance with the re-election of party chairman Lim Kit Siang in Ipoh Timor seat and his deputy, Karpal Singh in Bukit Gelugor seat although party secretary-general Kerk Kim Hock lost his seat. The DAP won 12 seats and regained the official leadership of the opposition in the national parliament from PAS. Most candidates who campaigned on platforms of Islamic issues lost their seats. This was a significant turnaround compared to the previous elections, where generally the more &quot;Islamic&quot; candidates had a greater chance of winning in the Malay heartland.

==Background==
On 2 March, the tenth national parliament and all state assemblies in Malaysia (with the exception of Sarawak) were dissolved by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong upon the advice of the Prime Minister. Sarawak&#x27;s last state election was held in 2001, and elections for the state assembly were not due till 2006.

The elections were held nine months earlier than required by the constitution. The constitution allowed for a parliamentary term of up to five years. Elections were required to be called three months after parliament is dissolved. The government had until the end of November 2004 to call elections.

==Campaign==
Candidates were nominated on 13 March, with the National Front winning 15 seats uncontested, and another two seats after the opposing candidates withdrew. The right to withdraw was only introduced as a new rule at these elections. Under this rule candidates are allowed a three-day period to withdraw following nomination day. Of the 17 parliamentary seats won uncontested, nine were in the state of Sabah, six in Sarawak and two in Johor.

PAS won a state assembly seat Senggarang in Johor for the first time, after the National Front candidate was disqualified because she was seconded by someone who was not a registered voter in the constituency that she wanted to contest. The requirement that the seconder be registered in the same constituency was only introduced in 2004. This seat was influenced by other opposition parties to gain many state seat in 2008 contest.

==Conduct==
The elections were marred by discrepancies, which were admitted by the electoral authorities. The head of the Election Commission, Ab Rashid Ab Rahman, made the statement &quot;I have been in this line for so long... it should not have happened at all. There must be reasons why this happened.&quot; He has served in the election commission for the last five elections, and has stated that he intends to resign if a report on the discrepancies implicates him in the foul-ups.

Among the discrepancies were wrongly printed ballots, registered voters being unable to vote and wide discrepancies in votes in various seats upon re-counting the ballots.

In the seat of Sungai Lembing in state of Pahang, the Keadilan symbol was printed wrongly on the ballot paper for PAS candidate Idris Ahmad. Illiterate voters tend to rely on familiar party symbols for voting purposes as they are unable to read the candidate&#x27;s names on the ballot. Voting was suspended for 5 hours before resuming. Polling was re-held for the seat on 28 March.

<text>Joel Asaph Allen (July 19, 1838 – August 29, 1921) was an American zoologist, mammalogist, and ornithologist. He became the first president of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, the first curator of birds and mammals at the American Museum of Natural History, and the first head of that museum&#x27;s Department of Ornithology. He is remembered for Allen&#x27;s rule, which states that the bodies of endotherms (warm-blooded animals) vary in shape with climate, having increased surface area in hot climates to lose heat, and minimized surface area in cold climates, to conserve heat.

==Early life==
Allen was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Joel Allen and Harriet Trumbull. He studied and collected specimen of natural history early in life, but he was forced to sell his relatively large collection so that he could attend the Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy in 1861. The following year, he transferred to Harvard University, where he studied under Louis Agassiz.

==Career as a field collector of natural history==
In 1865, he took part in his mentor&#x27;s 1865 expedition to Brazil in search of evidence of an ice age there, which Agassiz later claimed to have found. After returning to Massachusetts, chronic ill health caused him to return to his family farm in Springfield.

By 1867, Allen&#x27;s health had improved enough that he went on a flurry of collecting trips, including at Sodus Bay, and in Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana. Upon his return to Massachusetts, he took the position of curator of birds and mammals at Harvard&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology. In the winter of 1868–1869, he was one of two ornithologists, the other being Charles Johnson Maynard, to explore the relatively unknown state of Florida, which was still very much a wilderness in the late 1860s.

When he returned, he wrote a celebrated analysis of his trip entitled &quot;On the Mammals and Winter Birds of Eastern Florida,&quot; which was published in 1871. That same year he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

For the next few years, Allen ventured to the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and Dakota Territory on collecting trips for Harvard&#x27;s museum. Except for an 1882 collecting trip in Colorado with fellow ornithologist William Brewster, Allen never went field collecting again, primarily because of his fragile health.

==Career as a researcher and natural historian==
Following the end of his field-collecting days, Allen dedicated his life to research and editorial publication. In the early summer of 1876, Allen was elected by the Nuttall Ornithological Club to replace Charles Johnson Maynard and Henry Augustus Purdie as editor of their &quot;Bulletin&quot;. In 1883, Allen, along with William Brewster and Elliott Coues, created the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union. Allen, who was suffering ill health, was unable to attend their inaugural meeting, but was elected their first president, nonetheless. He also became the chief editor of their journal, &quot;The Auk&quot;.

In 1885, he was appointed as the first curator of birds and mammals at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, later becoming the first head of the museum&#x27;s Department of Ornithology. In 1886, he was one of the incorporators of the first Audubon Society, New York City. He was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of the American Philosophical Society.

The hundreds of letters which Elliott Coues sent to him over many decades form one of the cornerstones of the history of American ornithology. Allen famously memorialized Coues in the pages of &quot;The Auk&quot;, the union&#x27;s journal, after the latter&#x27;s death in 1899. He formulated what is now known as Allen&#x27;s rule, stating a correlation between body shape and climate, in 1877.

<text>STS-54 was a NASA &quot;Space Transportation System&quot; (Space Shuttle) mission using Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. This was the third flight for &quot;Endeavour&quot;, and was launched on January 13, 1993 with Endeavour returning to the Kennedy Space Center on January 19, 1993.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==
The primary payload was the fifth TDRS satellite, TDRS-F, which was deployed on day one of the mission. It was later successfully transferred to its proper orbit by the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS). Also carried into orbit in the payload bay was a Hitchhiker experiment called the Diffuse X-ray Spectrometer (DXS). This instrument collected data on X-ray radiation from diffuse sources in deep space.

Other middeck payloads to test the effects of microgravity included the Commercial General Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGPA) for-life sciences research; the Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space Experiment (CHROMEX) to-study plant growth; the Physiological and Anatomical Rodent Experiment (PARE) to examine the skeletal system and the adaptation of bone to space flight; the Space Acceleration Measurement Equipment (SAMS) to measure and record the microgravity acceleration environment of middeck experiments; and the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) to measure the rate of flame spread and temperature of burning filter paper.

Also, on day five, mission specialists Mario Runco Jr. and Gregory J. Harbaugh spent nearly 5 hours in the open cargo bay performing a series of space-walking tasks designed to increase NASA&#x27;s knowledge of working in space. They tested their abilities to move about freely in the cargo bay, climb into foot restraints without using their hands and simulated carrying large objects in the microgravity environment. The EVA completed after 4 hours, 28 minutes.

The EVA was a late addition to the mission plan as part of NASA&#x27;s objectives to hone EVA skills required for hardware assembly anticipating the International Space Station.

The mission completed on January 19, 1993, with a landing at Kennedy Space Center.

<text>STS-56 was a NASA Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; mission to perform special experiments. It was Discovery&#x27;s 16th flight. The mission was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 8, 1993.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==

The primary payload of the flight was the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-2 (ATLAS-2), designed to collect data on the relationship between the Sun&#x27;s energy output and Earth&#x27;s middle atmosphere and how these factors affect the ozone layer. It included six instruments mounted on a Spacelab pallet in the cargo bay, with the seventh mounted on the wall of the bay in two Get Away Special (GAS) canisters. Atmospheric instruments included the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment, the Millimeter Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS), and the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV/A) spectrometer (on the cargo bay wall). Solar science instruments were the solar spectrometry instrument SOLSPEC, the Solar Ultraviolet Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM), and the Active Cavity Radiometer (ACR) and Solar Constant (SOLCON) experiments.

ATLAS-2 is one element of NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth program. All seven ATLAS-2 instruments first flew on ATLAS-1 during STS-45, and flew a third time in late 1994 on STS-66.

On April 11, 1993, the crew used the remote manipulator arm (Canadarm) to deploy the Shuttle Point Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy-201 (SPARTAN-201), a free-flying science instrument platform designed to study velocity and acceleration of the solar wind and observe the Sun&#x27;s corona. Collected data was stored on tape for playback after return to Earth. SPARTAN-201 was retrieved on April 13, 1993.

The crew also made numerous radio contacts to schools around the world using the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX II), including brief radio contact with the Russian Mir space station, the first such contact between Space Shuttle and Mir using amateur radio equipment. It was arguably the first time that the astronauts received amateur television video from the ham radio club station (W5RRR) at JSC.

Other cargo bay payloads were the Solar Ultraviolet Experiment (SUVE), sponsored by Colorado Space Grant Consortium and located in a GetAway Special canister on the cargo bay wall.

The middeck payloads were the Commercial Materials Dispersion Apparatus Instrumentation Technology Associates Experiment (CMIX), the Physiological and Anatomical Rodent Experiment (PARE), Space Tissue Loss (STL-1) experiment, the Cosmic Ray Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM) experiment. the Hand-held, Earth-oriented, Real-time, Cooperative, User-friendly, Location-targeting and Environmental System (HERCULES), Radiation Monitoring Equipment (RME III), and an Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) calibration test.

<text>Phantom Entertainment, Inc. (known as Infinium Labs, Inc. until 2006) was a company founded in 2002 by Tim Roberts which made computer keyboards. However, Phantom was best known for the Phantom, a video game console advertised for Internet gaming on demand in 2004; it was never marketed, leading to suggestions that it was vaporware. The company&#x27;s website was last updated in late 2011, and Phantom&#x27;s ownership of the domain has since expired.

==History==
Infinium Labs was founded by Tim Roberts in 2002 as a private company. In January 2003 it issued a press release saying that it would soon release a &quot;revolutionary new gaming platform&quot; with an on-demand video-game service, delivering games through an online subscription. The press release had no specific information, but included a computer-generated prototype design. Due to the use of buzzwords and the lack of details, the product was derided nearly from the beginning by news sites such as &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Slashdot&quot; and in the &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; webcomic. The hardware and gaming site HardOCP researched and wrote an extensive article on the company and its operation, and was sued in turn. The Phantom placed first in &quot;Wired News&quot;″s &quot;Vaporware 2004&quot;. In 2004, Infinium Labs went public.

Roberts left the company in summer 2005 (with millions of shares of stock) before any products had been delivered. He later rejoined as chairman of the board, but in a July 2007 press release he again resigned from the company. Subsequent CEOs included Kevin Bachus (who took the post in August 2005), Greg Koler (in January 2006) and John Landino, who was appointed CEO and interim chief financial officer in July 2008.

In September 2006 the company (which had changed its name from Infinium Labs) promised to introduce its Phantom Lapboard product in November 2006, with a gaming service to follow in March 2007. In June 2008, the company released the Lapboard. In August 2007, Phantom Entertainment signed an agreement with ProGames Network to provide Lapboards and &quot;game-service content&quot; in hotels worldwide.

==The Phantom==

The Phantom is a cancelled home video game console whose development was supposedly begun by Phantom Entertainment–then known as Infinium Labs–in 2003. The device was said to be capable of playing current and future PC games, giving the system a large initial game library and making it easier for developers to produce games for the system. The system was said to feature a direct-download content delivery service, instead of the discs and cartridges used by most game consoles at the time.

Press releases said in 2003 that the console would be released that year, and the digital rights management software would be provided by DiStream. A prototype Phantom was first seen at the May 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), although it was rumored to be fake. Robrady Design was hired to develop the first Phantom prototype, and Synopse ID was later retained to develop second- and third-generation prototypes.

Two units of the first-generation prototype were known to exist, one publicly destroyed by HardOCP at QuakeCon 2004 as a result of their legal battles with the company (see below), the other was spotted by a computer repair shop in Venice, Florida in 2015 and reported by &quot;Ars Technica&quot;. In October 2021, a first-generation prototype unit was listed for auction, presumably the same unit that was previously reported by Ars Technica due to its listed repair history. A second-generation prototype unit shown at E3 2004 surfaced a year later after the discovery of the surviving 2003 prototype.

===Release===
The Phantom had an online release on August 17, 2003, with basic hardware specifications and a price of &quot;below $399&quot;. Options included customized hardware and the PhantomNet (a gaming-content service), priced at $9.95 a month. A sale date for the first quarter of 2004 was set. It was missed; the company later claimed it would go on sale in November for the holiday season, although it had not developed online-delivery software, licensed games or found any retailers. The second deadline was missed, with Infinium sending thousands of faxes claiming that the system would be released in January 2005.

When that deadline passed, Infinium predicted the system&#x27;s release for around March 2005. That date also passed, and Infinium Labs was absent from the 2005 E3. Kevin Bachus (former Infinium CEO) hinted that the Phantom would be released around the same time as the Xbox 360 in fall 2005, but that date was also missed. By August 2006, the Phantom Console was removed from the products page of the Phantom Entertainment website.

===Financial problems===
The company was unable to raise its projected $30 million to complete the Phantom and announced it would downsize and focus on the Phantom Lapboard, a wireless keyboard for home use. On May 16, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Phantom Entertainment founder and former CEO Timothy Roberts of running a &quot;pump and dump&quot; scheme in promoting the Phantom console in 2004. The Phantom lost credibility in the gaming and business worlds because its release date was continually pushed back, and because of financial scandals involving Phantom Entertainment (which lost more than $62.7 million since its creation).

==Lapboard==
The Phantom Lapboard is a wireless keyboard made by the company. It was released on June 23, 2008, two years after its originally planned release date. Designed as a component of the Phantom game console, it was ultimately sold for use with Internet TV and PC video games since the Phantom console was cancelled, and never made it to market. In 2010, a new model of the Lapboard was released to work with Internet TV, gaming and media centers.

===Announcement===
On January 3, 2006, Infinium Labs announced that the lapboard component of the console (a keyboard and mouse designed to be held on the lap, for example, seated on a couch in front of a television) was due to be released to online retailers by the second quarter of 2006. On April 19 it announced that the keyboard would not be released in time for Q2 2006, but the device (manufactured by Itron Technology) would be released in North America and Europe &quot;no later than October&quot; 2006. On August 15 it was announced that the price for the Lapboard would be $129.99, with customers who preordered receiving a $30 discount. The keyboard was then delayed until November. On August 22, 2007, Phantom Entertainment signed an agreement with ProGames Network to provide Lapboards and its game services content in hotels worldwide as well as with Alienware for their media center PCs (Alienware later pulled out of the agreement in December 2007 due to another delay in Lapboard&#x27;s launch). The keyboard was finally released on June 23, 2008, two years after its originally planned release date.

===Reception===

In April 2008 &quot;Maximum PC&quot; published a preview of the lapboard, describing it as &quot;extremely promising&quot; although the supplied mouse &quot;experienced signal dropouts at a distance of about 24 inches from the sensor&quot;. The author was able to use other wireless mice successfully. The preview states that the peripheral will be available in &quot;June for $130 in limited quantities&quot;. In the actual review, however, &quot;Maximum PC&quot; gave the Lapboard a verdict of 4 out of 10 saying: &quot;The bottom line is that this thing is bad. The mouse isn’t good for gaming, the angled keyboard is awful for typing, and for media playback you’d do much better with a slimmer wireless media keyboard with a built-in trackpad or ball, which are available for significantly less than the Lapboard’s $140 asking price.&quot; 
On July 20, 2009, a sample lapboard received a favorable review from the &quot;Hardware Heaven&quot; website. Despite its lukewarm review, in May 2010 About.com included the Phantom Lapboard in its Father&#x27;s Day gift guide. On July 19, 2010, Michael Welter posted a generally positive review of the Phantom Lapboard on &quot;Missing Remote&quot;.

==Legal controversies==

===HardOCP lawsuit===
In September 2003 HardOCP, a computer-hardware news website, published an investigative report by writer Steve Lynch critical of Infinium Labs and its founder. On February 19, 2004, Infinium Labs&#x27; lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to HardOCP&#x27;s editor demanding that the news site take down the article, claiming that it &quot;painted a portrait of a company intent on swindling the public&quot; and threatening to file a defamation suit. Rather than concede to Infinium&#x27;s demands, HardOCP owner Kyle Bennett filed a lawsuit for a declaratory judgment that his company had done nothing wrong. Infinium Labs then filed suit in Florida, denying that Texas was the proper jurisdiction (although it had previously maintained a staffed office in Richardson).

In September 2004, the judge required Infinium Labs to produce a number of financial records, including Roberts&#x27;s personal income-tax returns, by the end of that month. Because the company failed to produce the required documents, HardOCP won a court order compelling them to do so. The judge ruled that sanctions would be awarded to KB Networks and Kyle Bennett in an amount to be determined by the court (later reported as $50,000). Infinium Labs settled the suit, agreeing to drop the pending Florida suit, and admitting all allegations of KB Networks&#x27; Texas complaint; they paid $50,000 to end the suit.

===Other controversies===
In October 2005, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had notified Tim Roberts that charges were pending against him for violating federal securities laws. In a statement about the notice, Infinium said it was not notified of specific charges, but suspected they were related to an SEC investigation of the unlawful promotion of penny stocks (including Infinium&#x27;s). Roberts hired a stock promoter to send faxes claiming that the Phantom console&#x27;s release was imminent, and the company&#x27;s stock price might increase as much as 3,000 percent. The SEC alleged that the company never intended to release the console at the promised time due to significant unresolved &quot;technological and manufacturing hurdles&quot;, and the faxes were part of a pump and dump scheme on the part of Roberts. Roberts reached a settlement with the SEC in which he was barred from serving as an officer or public director of a public company or participating in penny-stock offerings for five years and paid a $30,000 fine. Roberts was again convicted of fraud in 2017 in a case involving his cloud commerce startup venture Savtira, which collapsed in 2011.

When Roberts was CEO of Infinium, the company failed to report a substantial amount of interest and penalties on unpaid payroll taxes. From its inception, the company had consistently reported a small amount of cash on hand amid extensive (and increasing) debt.

In January 2006, Infinium Labs reached an agreement to borrow up to $5,000,000 from Golden Gate Investors to finance the manufacturing of the Phantom Lapboard, scheduled for release later that year. This would have been the largest amount of money Infinium Labs had ever borrowed at one time. The loan would have been repaid over three years, with an option of repayment with shares of common stock.

In February, &quot;GameSpot&quot; reported that Phantom Entertainment was suspending the Phantom Game Service to develop the Lapboard. An SEC filing showed three-year losses in excess of $62.7 million, over half of which was marketing for the company and unreleased products. Over $24 million was spent on salaries and consultants, and $2.5 million on development. Infinium claimed it still intended to release the Lapboard if its financial situation improved, but it missed release dates for the second quarter of 2006, October 2006 and November 2006. On August 15, 2006, Phantom Entertainment removed all references to the Phantom Game Receiver from its website, claiming that the content-delivery system targeted for the Phantom would be available for PCs running the Microsoft Windows XP Media Center edition; it later indicated this service would be available in March 2007, after the initially planned November 2006 release of the Lapboard, the service did not materialize when the Lapboard ultimately launched in 2008.

<text>STS-55, or Deutschland 2 (D-2), was the 55th overall flight of the NASA Space Shuttle and the 14th flight of Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. This flight was a multinational Spacelab flight involving 88 experiments from eleven different nations. The experiments ranged from biology sciences to simple Earth observations.

== Crew ==

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Launch ==
&quot;Columbia&quot; was initially scheduled to launch in late February 1993. However, this date slipped to early March 1993 due to concerns with the tip-seal retainers in the main engines&#x27; oxidizer turbopumps. All three turbopumps were replaced at the pad but later inspection revealed the retainers to be in good condition. Further delays were caused by the burst of a hydraulic flex hose in the aft compartment during the Flight Readiness Test (FRT). The lines were removed and inspected and three replacements were installed.

== Mission highlights ==
&quot;Columbia&quot; carried to orbit the second reusable German Spacelab D-2 and demonstrated the shuttle&#x27;s ability for international cooperation, exploration, and scientific research in space. The Spacelab module and an exterior experiment support structure contained in &quot;Columbia&quot;″s payload bay comprised the Spacelab D-2 payload. The first German Spacelab flight, D-1, flew Shuttle mission STS-61-A in October 1985. The United States and Germany gained valuable experience for future space station operations.

The D-2 mission, as it was commonly called, augmented the German microgravity research program started by the D-1 mission. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) had been tasked by the German Space Agency (DARA – Deutsche Agentur für Raumfahrtangelegenheiten) to conduct the second mission. DLR, NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and agencies in France and Japan contributed to D-2&#x27;s scientific program. Eleven nations participated in the experiments. Of the 88 experiments conducted on the D-2 mission, four were sponsored by NASA.

The crew worked in two shifts around-the-clock to complete investigations into the areas of fluid physics, materials sciences, life sciences, biological sciences, technology, Earth observations, atmospheric physics, and astronomy. Many of the experiments advanced the research of the D-1 mission by conducting similar tests, using upgraded processing hardware, or implementing methods that took full advantage of the technical advancements since 1985. The D-2 mission also contained several new experiments which were not previously flown on the D-1 mission.

The mission surpassed the 365th day in space for the Space Shuttle fleet and the 100th day of flight time in space for &quot;Columbia&quot;, the fleet&#x27;s oldest Space Shuttle orbiter, on its fourteenth flight.

D-2 marked the first telerobotic capture of a free floating object by flight controllers in Germany. The crew conducted the first intravenous saline solution injection in space as part of an experiment to study the human body&#x27;s response to direct fluid replacement as a countermeasure for amounts lost during space flight. They also successfully completed an in-flight maintenance procedure for collection of orbiter waste water, which allowed the mission to continue.

STS-55 crew members participated in two amateur radio experiments, SAREX II from the United States and the German SAFEX. These experiments allowed students and amateur radio operators from around the world to talk directly with the Space Shuttle in orbit and participated in a SpaceMedicine conference with the Mayo Clinic.

<text>STS-57 was a NASA Space Shuttle-Spacehab mission of that launched June 21, 1993, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

== Crew ==
=== Spacewalk ===
* Personnel: Low and Wisoff
* Date: June 25, 1993 (13:07–18:57 UTC)
* Duration: 5 hours and 50 minutes

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==
The mission was launched on the summer solstice. During the course of the ten-day flight, the astronauts successfully conducted scores of biomedical and materials sciences experiments inside the pressurized SPACEHAB module. Two astronauts participated in a spacewalk (EVA) and European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) was retrieved by the crew and stowed inside &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s payload bay. EURECA had been deployed from the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; in August 1992 (STS-46) and contained several experiments to study the long-term effects of exposure to microgravity.

An improperly installed electrical connector on &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm), installed 180° off its correct position, prevented EURECA from recharging its batteries with orbiter power. A flight rule requiring antenna stowage was waived and EURECA was lowered into the payload bay without latching its antenna. Mission specialists David Low and Peter Wisoff safely secured EURECA&#x27;s dual antennas against the science satellite during the spacewalk. David Low was mounted on a foot restraint on the end of &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s robotic arm while Mission specialist Nancy J. Currie-Gregg positioned the arm so David Low could gently push the arms against EURECA&#x27;s latch mechanisms. Payload controllers then drove the latches to secure each antenna. The five-hour, fifty-minute spacewalk completed STS-57 mission&#x27;s primary goal of retrieving the EURECA science satellite. Afterwards, Low and Wisoff completed maneuvers for an abbreviated extravehicular activity (EVA) Detailed Test Objective (DTO) using the robot arm. Activities associated with each of the areas of investigation — mass handling, mass fine alignment and high torque — were completed with both EVA crewmen taking turns on the robot arm. Low and Wisoff wrapped up their spacewalk and returned to Endeavour&#x27;s airlock shortly before 3:00 p.m. CDT.

During the rest of the mission, the crew worked on experiments in the Spacehab module in the Shuttle&#x27;s lower deck. These experiments included studying body posture, the spacecraft environment, crystal growth, metal alloys, wastewater recycling and the behavior of fluids. Among the experiments was an evaluation of maintenance equipment that may be used on Space Station Freedom. The diagnostic equipment portion of the Tools and Diagnostics System experiment was performed by Nancy J. Currie-Gregg. Using electronics test instruments including an oscilloscope and electrical test meter, Currie-Gregg conducted tests on a mock printed circuit board and communicated with ground controllers via computer messages on suggested repair procedures and their results.

On June 22, 1993, all six crew members talked with President Clinton.

In addition, Brian Duffy and Jeff Wisoff ran experiments in transferring fluids in weightlessness without creating bubbles in the fluid. The experiment, called the Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Experiment (FARE), studied filters and processes that could improve methods of refueling spacecraft in orbit. By transferring water between -diameter transparent tanks on &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s middeck, engineers evaluated how the fluids behaved while the shuttle&#x27;s steering jets fired for small maneuvers. Janice Voss worked on the Liquid Encapsulated Melt Zone (LEMZ) experiment, which used a process called
floating zone crystal growth. The low-gravity conditions of space flight permit large crystals to be grown in space.

Ron Grabe, Brian Duffy and Janice Voss participated in the Neutral Body Position study. Flight surgeons had noted on previous flights that the body&#x27;s basic posture changes while in microgravity. This postural change, sometimes called the &quot;zero-g crouch&quot;, is in addition to the to lengthening of the spine during space missions. To better document this phenomenon over the duration of a space mission, still and video photography of crew members in a relaxed position were taken early and late in the mission. Researchers included these findings in the design specifications of future spacecraft to make work stations and living areas more efficient and comfortable for astronauts.

Currie-Gregg conducted the electronics procedures portion of the Human Factors Assessment. She set up a work platform, then hooked up a notebook computer and went through a simulated computer procedure for a space station propulsion system.

On June 28, 1993, Currie-Gregg performed an impromptu plumbing job on the Environmental Control Systems Flight Experiment, a study of wastewater purification equipment that may be used aboard future spacecraft. The EFE used a solution of water and potassium iodide to simulate wastewater, which was then pumped through a series of filters to purify it. During the flight, experimenters observed a reduced flow of water through the device and opted to perform maintenance. Currie-Gregg loosened a fitting on one water line inside the experiment, wrapped the loose fitting with an absorbent diaper, and, using a laptop computer on board, reversed a pump on the experiment for about 20 minutes in an attempt to flush out the clog. She then retightened the fitting and resumed normal operation of the experiment. Ground experimenters proceeded to monitor the EFE for about an hour and a half to ensure the clog had been cleared.

== Mission insignia ==
The five stars and shape of the robotic arm of the insignia symbolize the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence. The SpaceHab overall contours are represented as the inner red lining of the patch. Also visible is the EURECA, with 3 yellow contrails, that are representative of the astronaut insignia (EURECA replacing the traditional star atop), with the orbiter circling the Earth.

<text>STS-51 was a NASA Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; mission that launched the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) in September 1993. Discovery&#x27;s 17th flight also featured the deployment and retrieval of the SPAS-ORFEUS satellite and its IMAX camera, which captured spectacular footage of &quot;Discovery&quot; in space. A spacewalk was also performed during the mission to evaluate tools and techniques for the STS-61 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission later that year. STS-51 was the first shuttle mission to fly a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a Trimble TANS Quadrex. It was mounted in an overhead window where limited field of view (FoV) and signal attenuation from the glass severely impacted receiver performance. Full triple-redundant 3-string GPS would not happen until 14 years later with STS-118 in 2007.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Launch Preparations ==
STS-51 was notable for having been scrubbed three times on the launchpad, each time after the crew had boarded the spacecraft:

* On July 17, 1993, the launch was scrubbed on the pad due to a flaw in the pyrotechnic initiator controller that triggers the release of the solid rocket boosters from the mobile launcher platform.
* On July 24, 1993, problems with a hydraulic power unit in one of the solid rocket boosters caused another scrub on the pad. Because of the Perseids meteor shower, the next launch window did not open until the second week of August 1993.
* On August 12, 1993, the count reached the T−3 second mark, at which point the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSMEs) had ignited. A shutdown was then triggered by faulty fuel flow sensors in one of the SSMEs.
* STS-51 was successfully launched on September 12, 1993.

== Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) ==

The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) was built by Lockheed Martin Astro Space for NASA in East Windsor, NJ. The satellite was deployed on flight day 1 and served as a test bed for advanced experimental communications satellite concepts and technology. Its Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS) upper stage fired on time 45 minutes after deployment and boosted the satellite to geosynchronous orbit on the first day of the mission.

The first attempt to deploy ACTS was delayed by the crew when two-way communications were lost with Mission Control Center (MCC) about 30 minutes before the deploy time. Flight controllers could receive telemetry and voice communications from &quot;Discovery&quot;, however the crew could not receive communications from the ground. The crew waived off the 2:43 p.m. CDT deploy when they did not receive a &quot;go&quot; from MCC as called for in preflight plans made for just such an occurrence. After the waive off of deploy, the crew changed the shuttle&#x27;s S-Band communications system to a lower frequency and restored two-way communications with the ground. The two-way communications had been lost for a total of about 45 minutes. After consulting the crew, flight controllers began immediately planning for the second, and ultimately successful deploy.

During the deployment on September 12, 1993, two Super*Zip explosive cords in the Airborne Support Equipment cradle (ASE) designed to release the spacecraft, one primary and the other a backup, simultaneously detonated. This caused minor tears in two dozen insulation blankets mounted on the bulkhead between the payload bay and the AFT near the #3 APU. The ASE ring holding the TOS was damaged as well, and ejected debris was visible as the stack moved away from the orbiter.

The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), a significant activity of the NASA Space Communications Program, provided for the development and flight test of high-risk advanced communications satellite technology. Using multiple spot beam antennas and advanced on-board switching and processing systems, ACTS pioneered new initiatives in communications satellite technology. NASA Glenn Research Center was responsible for the development, management, and operation of ACTS as part of a long legacy of experimental communications satellites.

After fulfilling its original mission as a key part of the ACTS Gigabit Satellite Network, the spacecraft continued operations through a partnership between the space agency and a nonprofit consortium. It was shut down April 28, 2004, after funding dried up. The satellite was put into a flat spin with its solar array edges facing the Sun, which should theoretically prevent it from ever being restarted. The spacecraft was moved to its final graveyard orbit at 105.2° west longitude – where it poses minimal risk to other satellites – after NASA concluded in 2000 that it probably lacked the fuel to move to a higher graveyard orbit. Nevertheless, ACTS should not re-enter the atmosphere for thousands of years, according to Richard Krawczyk, the ACTS operations manager at Glenn Research Center.

== SPAS-ORFEUS ==
Another payload on this mission was the Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS) telescope mounted on the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) payload carrier. ORFEUS was designed to provide information on how stars are born and how they die, while studying gaseous interstellar clouds. Also in the cargo bay was the Limited Duration space environment Candidate materials Exposure (LDCE).

Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) began development of the SPAS carrier (flown previously on STS-7, STS-41-B, and STS-39) in 1986 into a free-flying astronomical platform. The DARA/NASA agreement called for four co-operative science missions, with &quot;Deutsche Agentur für Raumfahrtangelegenheiten&quot; (DARA) providing the satellite, NASA the Shuttle launch and deployment/retrieval services, and the two parties sharing the science instruments. NASA provided the Shuttle free of charge, in return for access to data and the inclusion of U.S. experiments. ORFEUS, the Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer, designed to measure radiation between 400 and 1280 angstroms, was released at 14:06 UTC, on September 13, 1993, and was retrieved at 11:50 UTC, on September 19, 1993. Science contributions came from the University of Tübingen, Sternwarte Heidelberg, University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University (IMPAS). ORFEUS&#x27; telescope was fabricated by Kayser-Threde in Germany; France&#x27;s REOSC provided the f/2.5 mirror. The separate 950–1150 Å Interstellar Medium Absorption Profile Spectrograph (IMAPS) added to the observations of hot galactic objects and the interstellar medium at high spectral resolution (240,000). Other payloads were Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR&#x27;s) Surface Effective Sample Monitor and Canada&#x27;s IMAX Cargo Bay Camera, which was used to film &quot;Discovery&quot; in orbit for the IMAX film &quot;Destiny in Space&quot;. A portion of this footage was also included in &quot;Space Station 3D&quot;. This was the fourth flight of the SPAS platform, of a total of seven during the space shuttle program. The SPAS-ORFEUS version was reflown on mission STS-80 in 1996.

== Extravehicular activity (EVA) ==
On September 16, 1993, spacewalkers James H. Newman and Carl E. Walz performed an extravehicular activity (EVA) designed to evaluate tools, tethers and a foot restraint platform. Their findings reassured the designers and planners of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing flight that their preparations were sound. This was the third and final shuttle mission to include a preparatory EVA in response to the weaknesses in EVA training exposed by the STS-49 mission. The new equipment tested during the extensive spacewalk would later be required for the December 1993 
Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, and was only part of the objectives of the spacewalk, with Newman and Walz fulfilling the other goals as they explained at length to Mission Control Center the differences they perceived between work in orbit and ground training. The two EVA crewmen were ahead of schedule much of the day, and completed more tasks than originally planned. As the two astronauts were cleaning up, a balky tool box lid slowed them down when they had to pry it free and close it for &quot;Discovery&quot;″s trip home. The toolbox lid stretched the spacewalk by about 45 minutes over what had been planned, with Newman and Walz logging a total seven hours, five minutes, and twenty-eight seconds of time outside the vehicle. This was the 112th EVA performed in the history of human spaceflight.

=== Spacewalk ===
* Newman and Walz – EVA 1
* EVA 1 Start: September 16, 1993 – 08:40 UTC
* EVA 1 End: September 16, 1993 – 15:45 UTC
* Duration: 7 hours 5 minutes

== Secondary experiments ==
In-cabin payloads included the Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS), the Auroral Photography Experiment (APE-B), the Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG), Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space (CHROMEX), High Resolution Shuttle Glow Spectroscopy (HRSGS-A), IMAX, Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP) and the Radiation Monitoring Equipment (RME-III) experiment. The Investigation into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP), is designed to research the mixing of various solvent systems in the absence of convection found on Earth in hopes of controlling the porosity of various polymer membranes. RME measures gamma ray, electron, neutron and proton radiation levels in the crew cabin throughout the flight.

On board, Mission specialist James Newman donned a special visor to perform a medical experiment testing vision in weightlessness as part of investigations into how vision compensates for the inner ear&#x27;s lack of balance in space. Newman also successfully tested a Global Positioning System receiver flying aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; as an evaluation of using such equipment to supplement the shuttle&#x27;s navigation. Also, in a precursor of space station operations, one of &quot;Discovery&quot;″s fuel cells was turned off and restarted.

In another medical evaluation, Commander Frank Culbertson and Mission specialist Daniel Bursch rode a stationary bike on &quot;Discovery&quot;″s lower deck as part of a continuing study of using exercise to counteract the effects of weightlessness on the body. The crew also powered up an experiment that looks at improving membrane filters in weightlessness and checked on another experiment that has been running well studying the effects of microgravity on plant cells.

Astronauts Carl Walz and Jim Newman operated the experiments designed to study the glowing effect, one a spectrometer that records the effect on film in fine detail and another that records the effect on still photographs. The experiments are hoped to provide information about just what types of gases – in addition to atomic oxygen – create the glow. The information on kinds of gases in the extreme reaches of the atmosphere may be coupled with the materials exposure experiment in the cargo bay to assist with the design and construction of future spacecraft.

== Mission insignia ==
The five white stars and one yellow star of the insignia symbolize the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence. The insignia also depicts the triangular SPAS-ORFEUS on the right.

== Documentary ==
The crew of STS-51 were followed by a camera crew from Channel 4 from the United Kingdom from the day they were assigned to the flight and then through their training and, finally, the mission itself. The documentary of this crew is called &quot;Space Shuttle Discovery&quot; and it was narrated by Heather Couper. It was released in 1993.

<text>A chādor (Persian, ), also variously spelled in English as chadah, chad(d)ar, chader, chud(d)ah, chadur, and naturalized as , is an outer garment or open cloak worn by many women in the Persian-influenced countries of Iran, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and to a lesser extent Tajikistan, as well as in Shia communities in Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon, India and Qatif in Saudi Arabia in public spaces or outdoors.

A chador is a full-body-length semicircle of fabric that is open down the front. The garment is pulled over the head, and is held closed at the front by the wearer; the chador has no hand openings, buttons, or clasps. It may also be held closed by being tucked under the wearer&#x27;s arms. The word in Classical Persian could be used in reference to almost any cloth, headscarf, or even tents. This definition is mostly retained in the Eastern Persian varieties Tajiki and Dari, which commonly use reflexes of &quot;chādar&quot; in reference to almost any cloth or scarf, including loosely worn scarves that would be inappropriate to call a chador in Iranian Persian.

Before the 1978–1979 Iranian Revolution, black chadors were reserved for funerals and periods of mourning; colorful, patterned fabrics were the norm for everyday wear. Currently, the majority of Iranian women who wear the chador use the black version outside, and reserve light-colored chadors for indoor use.

==Historical background==

=== Ancient and early Islamic times ===

Fadwa El Guindi locates the origin of the veil in ancient Mesopotamia, where &quot;wives and daughters of high-ranking men of the nobility had to veil&quot;. The veil marked class status, and this dress code was regulated by sumptuary laws.

One of the first representation of a chador is found on Ergili sculptures and the &quot;Satrap sarcophagus&quot; from Persian Anatolia.

Bruhn/Tilke, in their 1941 &quot;A Pictorial History of Costume&quot;, do show a drawing, said to be copied from an Achaemenid relief of the 5th century BC, of an individual with their lower face hidden by a long cloth wrapped around the head. Some have mistakenly claimed this to be a woman, but it is actually a Mede soldier. Achaemenid women in art were almost always uncovered. One of the earliest written records of &quot;chador&quot; can be found in Pahlavi scripts from the sixth century as a female head dress worn by Zoroastrian women.

It is likely that the custom of veiling continued through the Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian periods. Veiling was not limited to noble women but was practiced also by Persian kings. 

During the Islamic era, the chador retained the meaning of adornment to some extent in Iran, but over time, it took on the meaning of Islam and the Islamic hijab which was one of the concepts of Quran and Islam which was considered a limitation of women.

=== Before Islam ===
In some artifacts remaining from the Achaemenid period, such as a relief in Ergili (in northwestern Anatolia), a fabric design in Pazyryk, and certain Greek-Iranian seals, coverings resembling modern-day chadors can be observed. Some statues from the Parthian period depict women wearing coverings similar to chadors, placed over a headscarf. Zia Poor also refers to the head coverings of women in images depicted on a Sassanian silver plate as chadors.

=== After Islam ===
During the Islamic period, the chador merely represented one type of clothing adapted to comply with Islamic dress codes and has never had a uniform function, shape, stitching, size, or even color. Based on literary evidence, in both pre- and post-Islamic Iran, the chador was used both as a covering for the face or head and as a full-body garment.

In its latter meaning, the chador has found various synonyms in Arabic, one of which is &quot;Hibrā.&quot; This term referred to the women’s covering during the Umayyad period (41–132 AH) and was considered a type of mulāyah. Mulāyah was the common covering for women outside the home in the early Abbasid period (132–656 AH), which covered the entire body. In one of the illustrations from a copy of &quot;Al-Maqamat&quot; by Al-Hariri, women are seen wearing coverings similar to today’s chador at gatherings of sermon and justice, dating back to no later than the mid-6th century.

Our understanding of the exact description of this covering, regardless of its name, is largely related to more recent periods, particularly from the Safavid and Ottoman eras onwards. Accordingly, women did not view the chador solely as a veil or covering; aesthetic considerations, especially in the choice of fabric and decorations, played a significant role. The influence of women’s financial status and social class was evident in determining the fabric and embellishments of the chador.

Elite women in Fes, unlike ordinary women in Morocco, adorned the edges of their chadors with white silk or other colors during the Ottoman period, fastening them with large gold or silver rings at the chest. During the Qajar period, the chadors of elite women were often made of silk, while less affluent women used &quot;Dabit&quot; fabric for their chadors. Elite women embroidered their black chadors with gold thread and attached silver or silver-plated borders, which gradually gave way to red borders in colors like blue, brown, and white, measuring two fingers wide. During this period, &quot;Abaya&quot; chadors, which were highly valuable and imported from Baghdad, were in high demand among these women.

===Pahlavi ===

The 20th century Pahlavi ruler Reza Shah banned the &quot;chador&quot; and all hijab during the Kashf-e hijab in 1936, as incompatible with his modernizing ambitions. According to Mir-Hosseini, as cited by El Guindi, &quot;the police were arresting women who wore the veil and forcibly removing it&quot;. This policy outraged the Twelver Shia clerics, and ordinary men and women, to whom &quot;appearing in public without their cover was tantamount to nakedness&quot;. However, she continues, &quot;this move was welcomed by Westernized and upperclass men and women, who saw it in liberal terms as a first step in granting women their rights&quot;.

=== Iranian Revolution ===
After the Iranian Revolution, compulsory hijab were introduced, which was met with opposition from women during the International Women&#x27;s Day Protests in Tehran, 1979.

In April 1980, during the Iranian Cultural Revolution, it was decided that it would be mandatory for women in government offices and educational institutions to observe the veil. In 1983, a dispute regarding the veiling broke out, and public conflict was motivated by the definition of veiling and its scale (so-called &quot;bad hijab&quot; issue), sometimes followed even by clashes against those who were perceived to wear improper clothing. Government felt obligated to deal with this situation; so, on 26 July 1984, Tehran&#x27;s public prosecutor issued a statement and announced that stricter dress-code is supposed to be observed in public places such as institutions, theaters, clubs, hotels, motels, and restaurants, while in the other places, it should follow the pattern of the overwhelming majority of people. Stricter veiling implies both chador and more loosely khimar-type headscarf, along with overcoat.

== Usage ==

Before the 1978–1979 Iranian Revolution, black chadors were worn by many women and girls for different purposes. Light, printed fabrics were the norm for everyday wear. Currently, the majority of women who wear the chador reserve the usage of light-colored chadors for around the house or for prayers. Most women who still go outside in urban areas in a light-colored chador are elderly women of rural backgrounds. During the reign of the Shah of Iran, such traditional clothing was largely discarded by the wealthier urban upper-class women in favor of modernity for western clothing, although women in small towns and villages continued to wear the chador. Traditionally a light coloured or printed chador was worn with a headscarf (&quot;rousari&quot;), a blouse (&quot;pirahan&quot;), and a long skirt (&quot;daaman&quot;); or else a blouse and skirt or dress over pants (&quot;shalvar&quot;), and these styles continue to be worn by many rural Iranian women, in particular by older women.

On the other hand, in Iran, the chador does not require the wearing of a veil. Inside the home, particularly for urban women, both the chador and the veil have been discarded, and there, women and teenagers wore cooler and lighter garments; while in modern times, rural women continue to wear a light-weight printed chador inside the home over their clothing during their daily activities. The chador is worn by some Iranian women, regardless of whether they are Sunni or Shia, but is considered traditional to Persian Iranians, with Iranians of other backgrounds wearing the chador or other traditional forms of attire. For example, Arab Iranian women in Western and Southern Iran retain their overhead Abaya which is similar to the overhead Abaya worn in Iraq, Kuwait, and Bahrain.

== Color of Chador ==
The choice of chador color was influenced by women’s tastes, which were also affected by their age and social standing. For example, Egyptian women in the years 1249-1251 AH (1833-1835 AD) wore black silk chadors, while their daughters wore white ones. In Turkey, after the reforms, despite the prevalence of chadors in various colors, younger women preferred turquoise, jade, and purple shades.

In Qajar Iran, elite women often favored black or dark purple and blue chadors. Today, while in cities—especially larger ones—the color of women’s chadors worn outside the home is predominantly black, in rural areas and cities with traditional cultural symbols, colorful chadors are still observed. Women’s prayer chadors, both in urban and rural areas, are generally lighter in color and often white.

== Beyond Iran ==
The Persian word entered South Asia, and appeared in the Hindustani language as (, anglicized as &quot;chaddar&quot;, &quot;chuddar&quot; and &quot;chudder&quot;). 
However, an Indian and Pakistani cādar may more closely resemble a dupatta. The Hindustani word can also refer to other type of sheets, such as bed sheets.
There are also a small Haredi Jewish groups in which the women wear black head-to-toe cloaks similar to the chador, such as the extremist &quot;Lev Tahor&quot;.

<text>Aubervilliers () is a commune in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, Île-de-France region, northeastern suburbs of Paris, France.

==Geography==

=== Localisation ===
Aubervilliers is one of three communes in the &quot;Plaine Saint-Denis&quot;, north-east of the centre of Paris.

The Canal Saint-Denis traverses the commune on the western side from north to south.

===Transport and communications===
Aubervilliers is a commune close to Paris and has numerous means of transport including: the A86 autoroute from L&#x27;Ile-Saint-Denis in the west to Drancy in the east with Exit 9 on the northern border of the commune, Route nationale N301 from Stains in the north and joining the Paris ring road in the south, the D20 from Gennevilliers in the west, the D27 from Bobigny in the east, and the D115 from Pantin in the south-east. The Paris ring road is just outside the southern border of the commune and there are two access routes to it: by the &quot;Porte d&#x27;Aubervilliers&quot; and by the &quot;Porte de la Villette&quot;. These roads provide easy access to the network of roads and motorways around Paris as well as Le Bourget and Charles de Gaulle airports.


The Canal Saint-Denis once had important river ports and there was the Paris-Hirson railway and an industrial railway for Saint-Denis/Aubervilliers which served the &quot;Plaine Saint-Denis&quot;.

====Public transport in the commune====

The RER railway passes through the north of the commune and the station of La Courneuve-Aubervilliers, located just north of the commune on the N301 road, serves Aubervilliers. There are also two Metro stations on the south-western border on Avenue Jean-Jaures: &quot;Aubervilliers-Pantin-Quatre Chemins&quot; at the corner of Ave. de la Republique, and Fort d&#x27;Aubervilliers at the corner of Ave. de la Division Leclerc.

The commune is served by:
* Paris Métro Line 7 : stations Aubervilliers-Pantin-Quatre Chemins and Fort d&#x27;Aubervilliers;
* Sixteen bus routes: ;
* Gare de La Plaine-Stade de France: as far as Saint-Denis and Aubervilliers;
* Gare de La Courneuve - Aubervilliers: located in La Courneuve commune about 1 km to the north of the commune border.
* Paris Métro Line 12 since 18 December 2012 with the opening of the Front Populaire station and ultimately, in May 2022, it got extended to Mairie d&#x27;Aubervilliers station, with 1 intermediate stop at Aimé Césaire station.
* Ligne 3b of the Île-de-France tramway since 15 December 2012 with the opening of the &quot;Porte d&#x27;Aubervilliers&quot; located in the Paris area near the commune.

==Urbanism==
===Typology===
Aubervilliers is an urban commune, as it is one of the dense or intermediate density communes, as defined by the Insee communal density grid. It belongs to the urban unit of Paris, an inter-departmental conurbation comprising 407 communes and 10,785,092 inhabitants in 2017, of which it is a suburban commune.

The commune is also part of the functional area of Paris where it is located in the main population and employment centre of the functional area. This area comprises 1,929 communes.

===Urban morphology===
The main quarters or districts of the commune are:
* Quatre-Chemins;
* Quarante-Cinq at La Villette;
* Maladrerie (and its 800 lodgings which form a Sensitive urban zone or ZFU);
* Pont-Blanc/Vallès/Hemet (the agglomération is called &quot;Vallès la Frette&quot;);
* Landy (split between Aubervilliers and Saint-Denis);
* Cité Crèvecœur (Crèvecœur Housing Estate);
* Cité du 112 (112 Housing Estate);
* Cité République (official name) (République Housing Estate);
* Sadi-Carnot;
* Les Presles;
* Cité Heurtault (Heurtault Housing Estate);
* Les Fleurs;
* Cité Gabriel-Péri (Gabriel-Péri Housing EState);
* Les Fusains;
* Square of roses;
* Le fort.

==Toponymy==
The town is mentioned in the Latinised form &quot;Albertivillare&quot; in 1059. It is from this that the inhabitants are known as &quot;Albertivillarien&quot;.

The place name of &quot;-villiers&quot; (a variant of &quot;-villier&quot;, &quot;-villers&quot;, &quot;-viller&quot;, coming from the Low Latin &quot;villare&quot;, derived from &quot;villa&quot; - progressively meaning &quot;farm&quot;, &quot;village&quot;, then &quot;town&quot;) is a characteristic appellative for agricultural domains in the Merovingian and Carolingian periods. The first part is the Germanic personal name &quot;Adalbertus&quot; from which are derived the names Albert (English form) and Aubert (French form) and also became a surname. It is homonymous with a hamlet in Seine-et-Marne, Aubervilliers, and &quot;Auberville&quot; in Normandy (the others are explained by the Old Norse personal name Osbern giving &quot;Auber&quot;, the name of a Norman family).

==History==
===Origins===
As with many communes in the outer suburbs the town had long been a rural area. Formerly known as &quot;Notre-Dame-des-Vertus&quot;, the village was on a plain which produced the best vegetables around Paris.

===Middle Ages===
Aubervilliers first appears in the archives in 1059 as &quot;Albertivillare&quot;, meaning &quot;estate of Adalbert&quot;. In the following year Henry I donated it to the Priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs. In 1111 the serfs were freed in Aubervilliers. In 1182 the priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs, located in Paris, granted Paris butchers the right to freely graze their cattle in the fields after the harvest was over. In 1221, Guillaume Bateste, lord of Franconville, became the first Lord of Vivier les Aubervilliers. The church, which at the beginning of the 13th century depended on one of the parishes of Saint Denis, soon became famous for the miraculous appearance of an image of the Virgin.

In 1336 Father Jacques Du Breul, Prior of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, reported the &quot;Miracle of the rain&quot;: A young girl busy preparing flowers to adorn the statue of the Virgin in the church saw her face streaming with tears when the rain began to fall on the parched crops. In 1338 King Philip VI of France and his queen went to Aubervilliers to visit the image. From 1340 to 1792 people went there in droves each year from Paris and its surroundings. In 1402 Michel de Laillier, Lord of Ermenonville, became Lord of Vivier les Aubervilliers. In 1429 the town was occupied by the English but was retaken by Michel de Laillier in 1436. Louis XI went there in November 1474 to the house of Pierre L’Orfèvre, the new Lord of Vivier from then until August 1478. The image of the Virgin in lead that the king wore on his hat was a representation of the one at Aubervilliers.

In 1531 the Lordship of Vivier les Aubervilliers was sold to the Montholon family which held it until 1779. The facade and tower of the church were built in the reign of Henry II. Civil wars which the Armagnacs stirred up in France led to the destruction of the village but the abundant alms of the many pilgrims who came from all sides allowed a prompt reconstruction. On 10 November 1567 the Battle of Saint-Denis took place in the &quot;Plaine Saint-Denis&quot; between the Catholic army of Anne de Montmorency and the Protestant troops of the Prince of Condé.

Henri IV stayed in Aubervilliers during the Siege of Paris in 1590.

===From the Renaissance to the 18th century===
The visit by Louis XIII in 1613, then again in 1614 and 1628, allowed the development of pilgrimage to &quot;Notre-Dame des Virtues&quot;. Jacques Gallemant, pastor of Aubervilliers, allowed a community of Oratorians to settle in Aubervilliers in 1618. They took charge of the Church of Notre-Dame-des-Vertus and developed an important pilgrimage around the statue of the Virgin of Aubervilliers. The installation from 1622 of a &quot;House of Notre-Dame des Vertus&quot; by the Oratorians of John de Bérulle then its progressive extension throughout the 17th century made Aubervilliers an important centre of French Catholic spirituality. Thinkers, &quot;pious and famous faithful&quot; such as Francis de Sales, Vincent de Paul, John Eudes (he stayed for two years), Jean-Jacques Ollier, Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the philosopher Nicolas Malebranche, and the son of the great Jean Racine - the poet Louis Racine participated in a pilgrimage there and returned. At the end of the 17th century and in the first half of the 18th century, the &quot;House of Oratorians of Aubervilliers&quot; became a &quot;stronghold&quot; of the Jansenist dissent.

In 1649, during the Fronde, Aubervilliers fell into misery. Crops were destroyed, death reigned and population declined. There were 125 deaths in 1652 in a population of about 1,500 inhabitants. Nevertheless, the small town was reborn although until the 19th century it was populated by farmers. Proximity to the Paris markets promoted Market gardening, especially on the &quot;Plain of Vertus&quot; which was famous for its onions and a wide range of vegetables. The existence of the Mazier farm at 70 Rue Heurtault is attested by a document in 1699.

===French Revolution and Empire===
On 12 August 1787 the first meeting of the Municipal Assembly of Aubervilliers took place. In 1789 there was a list of grievances, complaints and remonstrances written by Mesme Monard, the parish priest, and one of the leaders against the Oratorians. On 24 January 1790 the election of the first mayor of Aubervilliers took place: Nicolas Lemoine was elected. In 1792 the boundary of the commune of Aubervilliers was delineated.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the &quot;Plain of Aubervilliers&quot; was, in 1814 and 1815, the scene of a bloody battle between French troops and the Prussians who took and re-took it several times. The French soldiers were overpowered by numbers and were eventually forced to abandon it.

===From the Restoration to the Paris Commune===

On 13 May 1821 the Canal Saint-Denis opened. In 1832, an outbreak of cholera decimated the population. In 1840 a factory was set up to manufacture soap from resin. The Fort d&#x27;Aubervilliers was built in 1843 - it was part of the Thiers wall, a structure authorised in 1840 by Adolphe Thiers to protect Paris and, where appropriate, to subdue its rebellions forming an elongated belt around Paris. It was used for the repression of the Paris Commune. The grounds of the fort and its surroundings are part of Aubervilliers commune. In 1861 the Central Market was created.

On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, a small part of the commune of Aubervilliers was annexed to the city of Paris. At the same time, the commune of &quot;La Chapelle-Saint-Denis&quot; was disbanded and divided between the city of Paris, Aubervilliers, Saint-Denis, and Saint-Ouen. Aubervilliers received a small part of the territory of La Chapelle-Saint-Denis.

The Industrial Revolution and the expansion of Paris radically changed the situation in Aubervilliers. Industries were established next to the canal. On 6 October 1862 Baron Hainguerlot began the operation of General Stores in Saint-Denis. In 1866 he moved to Aubervilliers. In 1866 Saint-Gobain purchased a factory manufacturing sulphuric acid from John Frédéric Boyd which was located on Rue du Landy. On 12 September 1867 Lady Lequin began operating a Match factory at a place called La Motte, Rue du Vivier.

During the Siege of Paris in 1870 the municipal government took refuge in Paris at 20 Boulevard de Strasbourg. At the beginning of 1877 a tramway arrived in the city centre. In 1879, the &quot;boyauderie&quot; (Tripe factory) owned by Mr. Jacquart was established. It was later purchased by Witt SA, a boyaudier from La Courneuve. The whole complex was bought in 1921 by the Wanner establishment who manufactured insulating materials: ceramic, plaster, and cork tiles. On 18 June 1897 a grease manufacturing factory (industrial oils and greases) was established on Chemin Haut de St Denis at Aubervilliers and remained in operation until the Second World War. In 1898 a tram depot was built at the corner of the Avenue de la République No. 30 and Rue du Midi.

===The Belle Époque to the Second World War===
At the end of the 19th century the life of the small town was already closely linked to nascent industrialization. People from Belgium, Lorraine, Alsace, Brittany, Spain, and Italy arrived in successive waves. This capacity to absorb and mix populations is characteristic of the history of the commune. Workers come to live in the suburbs which were cheaper than in Paris. Ever since Aubervilliers has been a multicultural city where more than 70 nationalities live.

For decades major industries shaped the identity of the city.

The district of Quatre-Chemins, which straddles the boundary of Aubervilliers and Pantin, was pejoratively nicknamed &quot;La Petite Prusse&quot; (Little Prussia) due to many immigrants coming to work in the Saint-Gobain glassworks - established in 1866 next to the canal. The identity of the district led them to ask in vain for the status of full-function commune at the end of the 19th century.

Despite a call for privacy at the funeral on 10 January, there was an eruption of demonstrators by the Gauche prolétarienne (Proletarian Left) and people such as Kateb Yacine, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Michel Rocard. The Aubervilliers slum was visited two days later by Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas, followed by a controversial televised debate on 14 January on &quot;Les Dossiers de l&#x27;écran&quot;.

The construction of the Stade de France (Stadium of France) just north of the commune in 1998 was a stimulating element in the Saint-Denis Plain. With its 750 hectares on the outskirts of Paris, The Saint-Denis Plain covers one third of Aubervilliers and extends over Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen. Since the early 2000s this area, which was one of the largest industrial areas in Europe, has been changing and should receive the &quot;Campus Condorcet&quot; in the late 2010s.

In 2014, the commune has been awarded &quot;two flowers&quot; by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

The Franco-Chinese Friendship Association stated that from November 2015 to August 2016 over 100 ethnic Chinese in Aubervilliers had been robbed. 49-year old Chaoling Zhang (张朝林 &quot;Zhāng Cháolín&quot;), beaten in a robbery, died on August 16, 2016.

===Heraldry===
==Politics and administration==

Until the law of 10 July 1964 the commune was part of the department of Seine. The redistribution of the former departments of Seine and Seine-et-Oise resulted in the commune becoming part of Seine-Saint-Denis after the administrative transfer effective from 1 January 1968.

Aubervilliers is the only commune of the canton of Aubervilliers, created in 2015. It is one of the 9 communes of the arrondissement of Saint-Denis.

===Political trends and results===

In the 2008 municipal elections, the PS came first in the first round of 9 March 2008 but lost against the list headed by the PCF. Despite the national agreements to desist in favour of the leftist list in the best position, the PS list led by Jacques Salvator was maintained in the second round and won the election with 41.48% of the vote against the list of the incumbent mayor, Pascal Beaudet (PCF), the UMP, and the MoDem.

In March 2011 in the cantonal elections (Canton of Aubervilliers-Est) Pascal Beaudet (PCF, PG, GU, ZIP, Federated) again led the first round (30.9%) in the context of a record abstention rate (72.3%). The Socialist candidate continued again in the second round, as in 2008 but this time Pascal Beaudet won the election in the second round (50.76%). The two cantons of Aubervilliers are now run by the communists (Jean-Jacques Karman and Pascal Beaudet).

===Twinning===

Aubervilliers has twinning associations with:
* Beit Jala, Palestine (since 1997)
* Bouly, Mauritania (since 1994)
* Jena, Germany (since 1999)

==Population and society==

===Immigration===

Ethnic Chinese from Wenzhou began arriving in Aubervilliers in the 1980s and 1990s to participate in the textile industry. In 2016 protests staged by ethnic Chinese occurred after several Chinese in Aubervilliers were attacked, including one murder of a local Chinese man by delinquent youths. 4,000 ethnic Chinese live in Aubervilliers.

===Demography===
The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Albertivillariens&quot; or &quot;Albertivillariennes&quot; in French.

The results of the 2017 Census conducted by INSEE shows that the upward trend in the population continues dramatically since in the last ten years the population has grown by 17.2% from 73,699 to 86,375 inhabitants. The number of dwellings have increased by 4,662 from 2007 to 2017 or 15.6%, and the number of vacant units has increased from 1,713 in 2007 to 1,997 in 2017.

Between 1982 and 1999 43,000 people reported that they would come to live in Aubervilliers (68.1% of the population in 1999) and, as the population decreased by 4,589 during the period, it can be concluded that nearly 48,000 people left Aubervilliers. We can deduce from these figures that only a third of the population is stable.

The decade 2000–2010 saw a marked relaunching of demographics in the wake of the economic revival of the Plaine-Saint-Denis. The migration in the commune became positive (+0.4% per year from 1999 to 2010) and was combined with a natural balance growth (+1.75% per year). The increase is particularly noticeable in the western canton of la Villette in Landy. This strong recovery makes it necessary for the joint construction of a school (kindergarten and primary) from 2010 to 2014.

In 2010 there were 31,379 immigrants in Aubervilliers (or 41.2% of the population of the commune - the highest proportion in the department), including 3,919 from the European Union, 1,418 from the rest of Europe, 11,313 from the Maghreb, and 6,810 from the rest of Africa According to demographer Michèle Tribalat, in 2005 about three-quarters of young people under 18 years old in the commune are foreign or French of foreign origin, mainly from the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa.

==Economy==
In economic terms Aubervilliers is the fourth largest city in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis with 30,000 jobs and 2,444 businesses in the private sector.

The city has a dense network of SMEs representing 25% of employment. These SMEs include research laboratories such as Rhodia (730 jobs) and Saint-Gobain (400 jobs), large public institutions such as Orange S.A., Documentation française, transport services such as La Poste, and the workshops of La Villette such as the Paris Métro and a large RATP bus depot.

77% of available jobs are today in services, transport, and retailing. Industrial activities are present with companies such as &quot;lampes Aric&quot;, Thyssen elevators, Messier-Bugatti-Dowty, and Vesuvius plc. Headquarters and administrative departments of large firms have also established here: Rhodia, KDI, Motul, Lapeyre-GME (3,400 staff), and Zurich Insurance).

New industries have developed in recent years:
* Telecommunications: (TelecityGroup, Interxion, Completel, etc.) and telematic services (Atos, FNAC Direct, Acticall, etc.)
* Audiovisual and Cinema: (Euromédia, Carrere Group, Studios d&#x27;Aubervilliers, Ciné-Lumières, Téléshoping, NPA, etc..)
* Textiles and fashion (Kookai, Redskins, Hugo Boss, Afflelou, etc.)

Another sign of this change has been the strengthening of wholesale and import-export activities. With more than 300 establishments concentrated in the &quot;Entrepôts et Magasins généraux de Paris&quot; (Warehouses and General Stores of Paris) (EMGP) and also around the Port of Aubervilliers (district of La Haie-Coq), this sector is a new business area in strong development. Haie-Coq imports are cheap manufactured goods of all kinds (textiles, watches, toys, decoration, gadgets), usually from Chinese products, which distributed throughout France. The CIFA - Fashion Business Center is the centre of this business.

==Culture and heritage==
===Civil heritage===
* The Old Match Factory (1904) at 124 rue Henri-Barbusse (now Documentation française) is registered as a historical monument.
* The Maladrerie District: Renée Gailhoustet conceived the master plan for the Maladrerie District for a thousand housing units where there was previously a &quot;quasi-slum&quot;. The land area of 9 hectares was urbanised in ten phases from 1975 to 1984 under the supervision of the architects Magda Thomsen, Vincent Fidon, and Yves and Luc Euvremer with the concept of a mainly continuous pedestrian space and varied sizes of buildings in relation to the existing low-rise buildings. As well as Green roofs, patios, and neat gardens, the project increased the number of covered walkways and service roads for the inhabitants which was at odds with the HLM stereotypes for construction and without reference to dividing into City blocks. In addition to a retirement home, offices, shops, a childcare centre, and a socio-cultural centre (Espace Renaudie), there are artists&#x27; studios which were not anticipated at the outset.
* Le Corbusier School, 1997–2003, expanded and rebuilt by the architect Pierre Riboulet.
* The Tower La Villette
* Fort d&#x27;Aubervilliers
* The Hôtel de Ville (town hall) contains the following items that are registered as historical objects:
** Two decorative panels in the Hall of Commissions, depicting Abundance &amp; Peace and Work (1928 &amp; 1931)
** Painting: Allegory of the Liberation (1945)

===Religious heritage===

* The Church of Notre-Dame-des-Vertus (16th century) is registered as a historical monument. The church is the old centre of Aubervilliers and it was built on a rectangular plan like a covered market. The vault of the nave is decorated with a keystone representing the Virgin. The bell tower was erected in 1541 under François I and the facade of the building in 1628 when Louis XIII decided to build in the Jesuit style to express his gratitude to the Virgin after his victory over the Protestants. The church contains many items which are registered as historical objects:
** Statue: Virgin and Child (17th century)
** Statue: Virgin and Child (19th century)
** The Stained glass windows were blown out by an explosion in the gunpowder factory in La Courneuve fort on 15 March 1918 and they were redone by the Charles Champigneulle workshop. Many of them represent the miracles of Our Lady of Virtues. They are registered as three objects:
*** 3 Stained glass windows (Bays 3, 4, and 16) (20th century)

<text>A terrace in agriculture is a flat surface that has been cut into hills or mountains to provide areas for the cultivation for crops, as a method of more effective farming. Terrace agriculture or cultivation is when these platforms are created successively down the terrain in a pattern that resembles the steps of a staircase. As a type of landscaping, it is called terracing. 

Terraced fields decrease both erosion and surface runoff, and may be used to support growing crops that require irrigation, such as rice. The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of the significance of this technique.

== Uses ==

Terraced paddy fields are used widely in rice, wheat and barley farming in east, south, southwest, and southeast Asia, as well as the Mediterranean Basin, Africa, and South America. Drier-climate terrace farming is common throughout the Mediterranean Basin, where they are used for vineyards, olive trees, cork oak, and other crops.

==Ancient history==

The Yemen Highlands are known for their terrace systems which were constructed at the beginning of Bronze Age in the 3rd millennium BC. Terracing is also used for sloping terrain; the Hanging Gardens of Babylon may have been built on an artificial mountain with stepped terraces, such as those on a ziggurat. At the seaside Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, the villa gardens of Julius Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law were designed in terraces to give pleasant and varied views of the Bay of Naples.

Intensive terrace farming is believed to have been practiced before the early 15th century AD in West Africa. Terraces were used by many groups, notably the Mafa, Ngas, Gwoza, and the Dogon.

==Recent history==
It was long held that steep mountain landscapes are not conducive to, or do not even permit, agricultural mechanization. In the 1970s in the European Alps, pasture farms began mechanizing the management of alpine pastures and harvesting of forage grasses through use of single axle two-wheel tractors (2WTs) and very low center of gravity articulated steering 4-wheel tractors. Their designs by various European manufacturers were initially quite simple but effective, allowing them to cross slopes approaching 20%. In the 2000s new designs of wheels and tires, tracks, etc, and incorporation of electronics for better and safer control, allowed these machines to operate on slopes greater than 20% with various implements such as reaper-harvesters, rakes, balers, and transport trailers.

In Asian sub-tropical countries, a similar process has begun with the introduction of smaller, lower-tech and much lower-priced 2WTs in the 4-9 horsepower range that can be safely operated in the small, narrow terraces, and are light enough to be lifted and lowered from one terrace to the next. What is different from the Alpine use is that these 2WTs are being used for tillage and crop establishment of maize, wheat, and potato crops, and with their small 60-70cm-wide rotovators and special cage wheels are puddling the terraces for transplanted and broadcast rice. Farmers are also using the engines as stationary power sources for powering water pumps and threshers. Even more recently farmers are experimenting with use of small reaper-harvester attachments. In Nepal, the low costs of these mostly Chinese-made machines and the increased productivity they produce have meant that this scale-appropriate machinery is spreading across Nepal&#x27;s Himalaya Mountains and likely into the other countries of the Himalaya and Hindu Kush.

== In specific areas ==

=== South America ===
In the South American Andes, farmers have used terraces, known as &quot;andenes,&quot; for over a thousand years to farm potatoes, maize, and other native crops. Terraced farming was developed by the Wari culture and other peoples of the south-central Andes before 1000 AD, centuries before they were used by the Inca, who adopted them. The terraces were built to make the most efficient use of shallow soil and to enable irrigation of crops by allowing runoff to occur through the outlet.

The Inca people built on these, developing a system of canals, aqueducts, and puquios to direct water through dry land and increase fertility levels and growth. These terraced farms are found wherever mountain villages have existed in the Andes. They provided the food necessary to support the populations of great Inca cities and religious centres such as Machu Picchu.

=== Myanmar ===
In mountainous areas of Myanmar, terrace farming is known locally as the staircase or ladder farming (in Myanmar: ) ‌and the agriculture technique of that kind is known as လှေခါးထစ်စိုက်ပျိုးနည်း.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, some of the &quot;100 Selected Terraced Rice Fields&quot; (in Japanese: 日本の棚田百選一覧), from Iwate in the north to Kagoshima in the south, are slowly disappearing, but volunteers are helping the farmers both to maintain their traditional methods and for sightseeing purposes.

=== Canary Islands ===

Terraced fields are common in islands with steep slopes. The Canary Islands present a complex system of terraces covering the landscape from the coastal irrigated plantations to the dry fields in the highlands. These terraces, which are named &quot;cadenas&quot; (chains), are built with stone walls of skillful design, which include attached stairs and channels.

=== England ===
In Old English, a terrace was also called a &quot;lynch&quot; (lynchet). An example of an ancient Lynch Mill is in Lyme Regis. The water is directed from a river by a duct along a terrace. This set-up was used in steep hilly areas in the UK.

=== Israel ===

Ancient terraces are a common feature in the Jerusalem Mountains, often found in conjunction with ancient rock-cut agricultural structures including quarries, winepresses, olive oil presses, water holes, lime kilns, roads, and agricultural watchtowers. According to Zvi Ron&#x27;s estimation, these terraces encompass approximately 56% of the open grounds in the area.

Despite their prevalence, there is a lack of consensus among scholars regarding their construction date. Various theories have been proposed, with Zvi Ron suggesting that their origins date back to ancient times, Finkelstein proposing the Middle Bronze Age, and Feig, Stager, and Harel suggesting the Iron Age. Archaeologists Gibson and Edelstein conducted research on terrace systems in the Rephaim valley, proposing that the ones in &quot;Khirbet er-Ras&quot; were built during the Iron Age II, whereas those in &quot;Ein Yael&quot; were linked to the Second Temple and Roman periods. Seligman suggested that while some terraces were established in ancient times, the majority of them are more likely to have originated during the Roman and Byzantine periods. A 2014 research study on terraces near Ramat Rachel, using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), yielded dates ranging from the Hellenistic period to Mamluk and Ottoman times. The majority of the samples fell within the latter periods. However, the study&#x27;s ability to precisely determine the original construction date remains uncertain, as the results could also reflect subsequent agricultural modifications that affected exposure to sunlight.

<doc id="504294" wikidata="Q1796243" url="?curid=504294" title="Tasmanian Greens">
<text>The Tasmanian Greens are a political party in Australia which developed from numerous environmental campaigns in Tasmania, including the flooding of Lake Pedder and the Franklin Dam campaign. They form a part of the Australian Greens.

Following the 2024 Tasmanian State Election, the party holds five seats in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, and is currently led by Dr Rosalie Woodruff. At a federal level, two Tasmanian senators – Nick McKim and Peter Whish-Wilson – are members of the Greens.

The party&#x27;s current shadow ministry can be found at Woodruff Shadow Ministry.

==History==
The party&#x27;s history can be traced back to the formation of the United Tasmania Group (UTG) (the first established &#x27;Green&#x27; party in the world), which first ran candidates in the 1972 election. Many people involved in that group went on to form the Tasmanian Greens. Bob Brown stood as an Australian Senate candidate for UTG in 1975.

===1980s===
In the 1982 state election, Bob Brown stood unsuccessfully as an independent in the Denison electorate. In December of that year, Norm Sanders—a sitting member for the Australian Democrats—stood down from state parliament to contest the Senate in a Federal election. A countback of votes followed and Bob Brown was elected to the vacancy, commencing his term in January 1983. The two had much in common—both having been directors of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society—Norm Sanders being considered to be Australia&#x27;s first elected &quot;green&quot; member of parliament.

Immediately prior to taking the seat, Bob Brown had spent 19 days in Risdon Prison for obstructing workers at the Franklin River dam site. He took his seat on the day of his release. He was re-elected in the 1986 election along with Gerry Bates in the Franklin electorate.

In the 1989 state election a total of 5 Greens—Christine Milne, Lance Armstrong, Di Hollister, Gerry Bates and Bob Brown—were elected after a community backlash against a proposed paper pulp mill at Wesley Vale near Devonport. At the time of the election they were known simply as The Independents. In December 1991 they changed their name to The Green Independents. They held the balance of power in the government for three years, keeping Michael Field&#x27;s minority Labor Party government in power after signing an agreement known as the Labor–Green Accord. The February 1992 election saw all five sitting Greens re-elected but with a majority Liberal government in power.

Greens supporter Neville Curtis started the magazine &quot;Daily Planet&quot; in 1989, which later became the official magazine of the Green Independents.

===1990s===
During 1990-1991 Brown advocated for a merger of the Green Independents with the Australian Democrats to form the &quot;Green Democrats&quot;, as opposed to confederating with other Green Parties and forming the Australian Greens. However, following a change in leadership in the Democrats, this plan could not continue and the Independents aligned themselves towards a unified Green Party.

In August 1992 the Green Independents moved to officially form the Tasmanian Greens.

In 1993 Bob Brown stood down to contest the lower house seat of Denison in the federal election and Peg Putt took his seat on a recount. Christine Milne became leader. In May 1995 Gerry Bates resigned and his seat was taken by Mike Foley.

At the 1996 election, four Greens were returned (Lance Armstrong lost his seat in Bass) and they again held the balance of power, this time with a Liberal government.

After seven years of minority governments, the Labor and Liberal parties passed a bill reducing the number of Lower House seats, thus increasing the quota of votes needed under Tasmania&#x27;s Hare Clark voting system from 12.5% to 16.67%. In 2011, Labor MP David Llewellyn confirmed to ABC Radio that the two major parties had &quot;conspired&quot; to reduce the number of seats in the House specifically to increase the quota for minor parties such as the Greens: &quot;I could admit now that being part of the government back in 1998 or 1997 in conspiring, suppose that&#x27;s not the best of words but that&#x27;s what it was, between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party to reduce the size of Parliament on the basis that it would take more percentage for minor parties to actually win a seat.&quot;

The 1998 election returned a majority Labor government, as well as a sole Green member—Peg Putt—who had little chance of exercising any influence, but would offer bills into Parliament knowing they would in all likelihood be voted against by both Liberal and Labor parties.

===2000s===
The 2002 election saw a major resurgence of their popularity, with the party winning 4 seats, and outpolling the Liberal party in the Hobart based seat of Denison. The swing was primarily against the Liberal Party, while the Labor party continued in the majority. The statewide 18.2% vote in 2002 was the highest vote recorded for a Green party at a state or national level anywhere in the world.

At the 2004 federal election, former Tasmanian Greens leader Christine Milne and WA&#x27;s Rachel Siewert joined Bob Brown and NSW&#x27;s Kerry Nettle in the Senate, doubling the Green representation.

On 23 July 2005 the Greens celebrated 33.3 years of political activity and achievements, with a large party entitled &quot;33-and-a-third – Now we&#x27;re Long Playing!&quot;

The 2006 election saw a 1.5% swing against the Greens but all four sitting members were returned. In the lead up to this election Tasmanians for a Better Future organised a campaign against minority government suggesting it was a risky outcome for commerce and industry.

Peg Putt resigned from the House of Assembly on 7 July 2008, and was replaced as party leader by Nick McKim. Cassy O&#x27;Connor was elected as her replacement in Denison after a recount of votes.

===2010s===
During the 2010 Tasmanian state election, the Tasmanian Greens secured a swing of 5% for a total of 21.6% of the primary vote (The highest ever vote the greens recorded in any state election as of 2024), picking up a seat in Braddon and securing the balance of power in parliament, with the Tasmanian Greens members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly being Cassy O&#x27;Connor, Nick McKim, Kim Booth, Tim Morris and Paul O&#x27;Halloran.

On 16 January 2014, Premier Lara Giddings announced that a power sharing arrangement with the Tasmanian Greens was over.

At the 2014 Tasmanian state elections there was a 7.8% swing away from the Greens with the party losing two of its five seats. The re-elected Greens leader Nick McKim said the swing against the Greens was due to electoral support for the conservatives and the &quot;tarnish&quot; of the Greens association with the previous Labor government. Subsequently, Kim Booth was appointed as party leader, however he resigned as leader and from the Tasmanian Parliament on 20 May 2015. Cassy O&#x27;Connor was elected to replace him on 11 June 2015.

In mid 2015, with the resignations of Kim Booth and Nick Mckim and being replaced by Andrea Dawkins and Rosalie Woodruff respectively, the Tasmania Greens was entirely made up of female representatives in the Tasmanian Parliament, until the election of Vica Bayley in 2023.

=== 2020s ===
On 13 July 2023, Cassy O&#x27;Connor announced her resignation from her House of Assembly seat of Clark, and as Tasmanian Greens Leader. O&#x27;Connor also announced she would seek preselection to contest the seat of Hobart in the Tasmanian Legislative Council in 2024. Rosalie Woodruff was confirmed to replace O&#x27;Connor as leader of the party following the election of Vica Bayley to the seat of Clark.

At the 2024 Tasmanian Election, the Greens received 13.9% of the primary vote with a positive swing of 1.5% towards the party. The party increased its representation from two seats to five, electing members in the divisions of Lyons and Bass, in addition to re-electing party Leader Rosalie Woodruff in Franklin, and Deputy Leader Vica Bayley in Clark. The party also picked up a second seat in Clark for the first time.

The Greens would go onto win their first seat in the Tasmanian Legislative Council in the party’s history, with the election of Cassie O&#x27;Connor to the Division of Hobart in May 2024. The party now holds six seats across Tasmania’s two Houses of Parliament, their highest level of representation to date. 

==Electoral results==
===State===
===Federal elections===

At the 2013 federal election, for the lower house, the Tasmanian Greens secured 8.32% of first preference votes which represented an 8.7% swing away from the Greens.
==Structure==
There are five Electorate Branches—one representing each state/federal electorate—that are responsible for choosing candidates at all levels of government.

The party has an annual state conference and annual general meeting. The State Executive is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the party.

The Tasmanian Greens, together with other state and territory parties, form the Australian Greens.

==Local government==
Unlike other political parties in the state, the Tasmanian Greens officially endorse candidates to run in local government elections. They first stood local government candidates in 1999 with two candidates elected. Following the 2005 elections there were ten elected Greens councillors. This expanded to 13 after the 2007 elections.

<text>Drancy () is a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris in the Seine-Saint-Denis department in northern France. It is located 10.8 km (6.7 mi) from the center of Paris.

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The name Drancy comes from Medieval Latin &quot;Derenciacum&quot;, and before that &quot;Terentiacum&quot;, meaning &quot;estate of Terentius&quot;, a Gallo-Roman landowner.

=== Origins to 20th century ===
In the 17th century, Drancy was divided into two distinct villages: Drancy le Grand and le Petit Drancy. The quarter &quot;Village Parisien&quot; is built on the old location of the hamlet of Groslay, which was surrounded by the Forest of Bondy: hence the name of rue des Bois de Groslay. The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1859.

The end of nineteenth century was marked by industrialisation and the development of rail transport. During the Franco-Prussian war, Le Bourget was the site of an important battle and the castle of Ladoucette in Drancy was destroyed.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
During World War II, Drancy was the site of the Drancy internment camp where Jews, Gypsies, and others were held before being shipped to the Nazi concentration camps. In 1976, the Memorial to the Deportation at Drancy was created by sculptor Shlomo Selinger to commemorate the French Jews imprisoned in the camp. In 2009 the memorial was vandalised. The French government vowed to find those responsible for painting swastikas on it.

<text>STS-61 was NASA&#x27;s first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, and the fifth flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The mission launched on December 2, 1993, from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. The mission restored the spaceborne observatory&#x27;s vision (marred by spherical aberration in its mirror) with the installation of a new main camera and a corrective optics package (COSTAR). This correction occurred more than three and a half years after the Hubble was launched aboard STS-31 in April 1990. The flight also brought instrument upgrades and new solar arrays to the telescope. With its very heavy workload, the STS-61 mission was one of the most complex in the Shuttle&#x27;s history. 

STS-61 lasted almost 11 days, and crew members made five spacewalks (extravehicular activities (EVAs)), an all-time record; even the re-positioning of Intelsat VI on STS-49 in May 1992 required only four. The flight plan allowed for two additional EVAs, which could have raised the total number to seven; the final two contingency EVAs were not made. In order to complete the mission without too much fatigue, the five EVAs were shared between two pairs of different astronauts alternating their shifts. During the flight, mission specialist Jeffrey A. Hoffman also spun a dreidel for the holiday of Hanukkah to a live audience watching via satellite.

=== Launch ===
&quot;Endeavour&quot; was switched from Pad 39A to Pad 39B due to contamination of the Payload Changeout Room after a windstorm on October 30, 1993. The internal HST payload package was not affected because it was tightly sealed, and the contamination appeared to have been caused by sandblasting grit from recent Pad A modifications. On November 18, 1993, &quot;Endeavour&quot; experienced a failure of a transducer on the elevon hydraulic actuator. To replace the actuator would have required a rollback to the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) because access to the actuator was only through the Main Landing Gear wheel well. Since there were 4 delta-P transducers and the Launch commit criteria (LCC) required only 3 of 4, the transducer was depinned and would not be consulted during flight. The flight crew arrived at the KSC Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) on November 27, 1993, and the payload bay doors were closed at 20:20 UTC on November 28, 1993. The first launch attempt on December 1, 1993, was scrubbed due to weather constraint violations at the Shuttle Landing Facility. Just before the scrub the range was also in a no-go situation due to an long ship in the restricted sea zone. A 24‑hour scrub turnaround was put into effect with a launch window extending from 09:26 to 10:38 UTC on December 2, 1993. Launch mass was . Payload mass was . After launch, the astronauts carried out a series of checks on the vehicle and went to sleep seven and a half hours after liftoff.

=== Flight Day 2 ===
&quot;Endeavour&quot; performed a series of burns that allowed the shuttle to close in on the Hubble Space Telescope at a rate of per 95-minute orbit. The crew made a detailed inspection of the payload and checked out both the robot arm (Canadarm) and the spacesuits. All of &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s systems functioned well as the crew got a full day&#x27;s sleep in preparation for the evening&#x27;s rendezvous. At the end of Flight Day 2, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was behind HST and closing.

=== Flight Day 3 ===
HST was sighted by astronaut Jeffrey A. Hoffman using binoculars, whereupon he noted that the right-hand solar array was bent at a 90° angle. These solar arrays, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), were scheduled to be replaced during the second spacewalk because they wobbled 16 times a day (as the telescope heated up and cooled off while passing from the nighttime side of the Earth to the daytime side and vice versa), thus disturbing Hubble&#x27;s ability to maintain precise pointing.

The closing speed remained the same until the next reaction control system (RCS) firing, at 02:34 UTC, December 4, 1993. This height-adjusting (&quot;NH&quot; for &quot;Nominal Height&quot;) burn changed the shuttle&#x27;s velocity by , modified the high point of &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s orbit, and fine-tuned its course toward a point behind HST. The next burn, an orbital maneuvering system firing designated NC3, was scheduled for 03:22 UTC and changed &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s velocity by . &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s catch-up rate was adjusted to about per orbit and put it behind HST two orbits later. A third burn of just , called NPC and designed to fine-tune the spacecraft&#x27;s ground track, was executed at 15:58 UTC. The multi-axis RCS terminal initiation (TI) burn, which placed Endeavour on an intercept course with HST and set up commander Dick Covey&#x27;s manual control of the final stages of the rendezvous, occurred at 05:35 UTC. Covey maneuvered &quot;Endeavour&quot; within of the free-flying HST before mission specialist Claude Nicollier used &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s robot arm to grapple the telescope at 08:48 UTC, when the orbiter was several hundred kilometers east of Australia over the south Pacific Ocean. Nicollier berthed the telescope in the shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay at 09:26 UTC. Everything was on schedule for the first planned spacewalk scheduled for 04:52 UTC. After capture, additional visual inspections were performed using the camera mounted on the -long shuttle remote manipulator arm (Canadarm).

Earlier in the day, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC&#x27;s) Space Telescope Operations Control Center uplinked commands to stow HST&#x27;s two high-gain antennas. Controllers received indications that both antennas had nested properly against the body of the telescope, but microswitches on two latches of one antenna and one latch on the other did not send the &quot;ready to latch&quot; signal to the ground. Controllers decided not to attempt to close the latches, as the antennas were in a stable configuration. The situation was not expected to affect plans for rendezvous, grapple and servicing of the telescope.

=== Spacewalk #1 (Flight Day 4) ===
Story Musgrave and Jeffrey A. Hoffman started the first EVA about an hour earlier than scheduled by stepping into the cargo bay at 03:46 UTC. They began by unpacking tools, safety tethers and work platforms. Hoffman then installed a foot restraint platform onto the end of the shuttle&#x27;s remote manipulator arm (Canadarm), which he then snapped into his feet. Nicollier drove the arm from within the shuttle and moved Hoffman around the telescope. Meanwhile, Musgrave installed protective covers on Hubble&#x27;s aft low gain antenna and on exposed voltage bearing connector covers. The astronauts then opened the HST equipment bay doors and installed another foot restraint inside the telescope. Musgrave assisted Hoffman into the restraint and Hoffman proceeded to replace two sets of Rate Sensing Units (RSUs). These units contain gyroscopes that help keep Hubble pointed in the right direction. By 17:24 UTC, Hoffman had finished replacing RSU-2 (containing Gyros 2–3 and 2–4) and then replaced RSU-3 (containing Gyros 3–5 and 3–6). The astronauts then spent about 50 minutes preparing equipment for use during the second space walk and then replaced a pair of electrical control units (ECUs) (ECU-3 and ECU-1) that control RSU-3 and RSU-1. The astronauts also changed eight fuse plugs that protect the telescope&#x27;s electrical circuits. Hubble now had a full set of six healthy gyroscopes.

The astronauts struggled with the latches on the gyro door when two of four gyro door bolts did not reset after the astronauts installed two new gyro packages. Engineers who evaluated the situation speculated that when the doors were unlatched and opened, a temperature change might have caused them to expand or contract enough to keep the bolts from being reset. With the efforts of determined astronauts in &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s payload bay and persistent engineers on the ground, all four bolts finally latched and locked after the two spacewalkers worked simultaneously at the top and bottom of the doors. Musgrave anchored himself at the bottom of the doors with a payload retention device which enabled him to use some body force against the doors. Hoffman, who was attached to the robot arm, worked at the top of the doors. The duo successfully latched the doors when they simultaneously latched the top and bottom latches.

The spacewalkers also set up the payload bay for mission specialists Tom Akers and Kathy Thornton who would replace the telescope&#x27;s two solar arrays during the second spacewalk. In anticipation of that spacewalk, Musgrave and Hoffman prepared the solar array carrier which is located in the forward portion of the cargo bay, and attached a foot restraint on the telescope to assist in the solar array replacement.

Musgrave and Hoffman&#x27;s spacewalk became the second longest spacewalk in NASA history, lasting 7 hours 50 minutes. The longest spacewalk occurred on STS-49 in May 1992 during &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s maiden flight. Spacewalking crew members during that flight were Thomas D. Akers, Richard J. Hieb and Pierre J. Thuot. A number of spacewalks have since surpassed these. (See Lists of spacewalks and moonwalks)

In spite of the kink in array (about a panel and a half from the end), after a review by HST program managers, flight controllers decided to continue with the pre-flight plan and attempt to roll up and retract the solar arrays at the end of the first EVA. The stowage of the solar arrays is a two step process with the initial step involving the rolling up of the solar arrays and the second step involving the actual folding up of the arrays against the telescope. Each array stands on a four-foot mast that supports a retractable wing of solar panels long and wide. They supply the telescope with 4.5 kW of power.

=== Spacewalk #2 ===
Flight Day 5 began on Monday afternoon (December 6, 1993) at 15:35 UTC. Astronauts Thomas D. Akers and Kathryn C. Thornton replaced HST&#x27;s solar arrays during the second planned EVA (Thornton had red dashed s on her spacesuit while Tom Akers had diagonal red dashed stripes, which helped flight controllers tell the two spacewalkers apart). At the start of the EVA, the pressure in Thornton&#x27;s vent garment was instead of the normal pressure of . This was due to a possible ice plug in the suit&#x27;s plumbing which shortly melted. Thornton then topped off her suit. There were also other problems with Thornton&#x27;s EVA suit. Her communications receiver malfunctioned in a way that allowed her to communicate to Akers but not to Mission Control Center, Houston. The crew decided to use a technique of relaying all commands for Thornton via Akers instead of switching to the backup comm channel. The backup channel is used for suit biomedical telemetry and would have limited Mission Control&#x27;s ability to monitor that telemetry.

Akers started the EVA by installing a foot restraint on the Canadarm for Thornton and proceeded to begin disconnecting three electrical connectors and a clamp assembly on the solar array. He had a slight problem with the clamp assembly but had the connectors demated by 04:17 UTC. Thornton held the array in place so that it would not drift freely after being detached. The solar arrays weigh and are long when folded. The astronauts dismounted the damaged array at 04:40 UTC above the Sahara (during a nighttime pass to minimize electrical activity), and Thornton held the array until the next daylight pass (approximately 12 minutes) before throwing it overboard at 04:52 UTC over Somalia. The jettison during daylight allowed the astronauts and flight controllers to accurately track its position and relative velocity. The release by Thornton imparted zero velocity to the arrays and then the orbiter did a small burn to put some distance between it and the array. The array, moving away from Endeavour at , separated about each orbit. The crew then installed a new array, (finishing around 06:40 UTC) and rotated the telescope 180°. They then replaced the second solar array which was stowed away for return to ESA. After the 6.5 hours EVA, successful functional tests were performed by the Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) on four of HST&#x27;s six gyros. Gyros 1 and 2 were not able to be tested due to the orientation of the telescope and were tested during the crew sleep period Monday night (December 6, 1993).

=== Spacewalk #3 (Flight Day 6) ===
The third EVA began December 7, 1993, at 03:34 UTC while Endeavour was over Australia. Hoffman installed guide studs on the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC, commonly referred to as &quot;Whiffpick&quot;) and prepared the WF/PC for removal while Musgrave set up a work platform and worked on opening an access door to allow observation of WF/PC status lights. Hoffman attached the support handle to the WF/PC and, with assistance by Claude Nicollier on the arm and a free floating Story Musgrave, removed the WF/PC during the night pass starting at 04:41 UTC. The WF/PC was clear of the telescope by 04:48 UTC and moved back into its storage container. A protective hood was then removed on the new Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) (protecting its fragile external mirror) and the WFPC2 was then installed at 06:05 UTC. Ground controllers then ran an Aliveness Test and 35 minutes later reported that the new camera successfully performed its series of initial tests. The new Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 had a higher rating than the previous model, especially in the ultraviolet range, and included its own spherical aberration correction system.

Following the WFPC2 installation, Hoffman changed out two magnetometers on board HST. The magnetometers, which are located at the top of the telescope, are the satellite&#x27;s &quot;compass&quot;. They enable HST to find its orientation with respect to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Both original units were suffering from problems of background noise. During installation, two pieces peeled off the magnetometers. The EVA lasted 6 hours and 47 minutes.

=== Spacewalk #4 (Flight Day 7) ===
The fourth EVA began on December 8, 1993, while &quot;Endeavour&quot; was flying over Egypt at 03:13 UTC with Thornton and Akers. The primary task of the EVA was to replace HST&#x27;s High Speed Photometer (HSP) with the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) system which would correct HST&#x27;s spherical aberration of the main mirror for all instruments except the WFPC2 camera, which had its own built-in corrective optics. Akers received a go for the opening of HST&#x27;s -V2 aft shroud doors at 22:45 EST. The doors were scheduled to be opened during a night pass to minimize thermal changes and reduce the possibility of out-gassing of components that could contaminate the optics. The High Speed Photometer (HSP) was powered down at 03:54 UTC and the door opening started at 03:57 UTC. Shortly after partially opening the door, the astronauts practiced reclosing the door. The door exhibited the same reluctance upon closing that was experienced on different doors during previous EVAs. The doors were fully opened by 04:00 UTC and four power and data connectors plus one ground strap were disconnected from the HSP. The HSP was removed at 04:27 UTC and then reinserted to practice for the COSTAR installation. HSP was then parked on the side of the payload bay while COSTAR was removed from stowage and successfully installed in the HST by about 05:35 UTC. The astronauts closed the HST equipment bay doors and stowed the HSP. At 07:25 UTC they started upgrading HST&#x27;s onboard computer by bolting on an electronics package containing additional computer memory and a co-processor. The computer system was then reactivated and passed its functionality tests at 09:41 UTC. The EVA was 100% successful and lasted for 6 hours 50 minutes.

Pilot Kenneth D. Bowersox, using &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s RCS system, performed two orbital maneuvers and boosted HST from a orbit to a circular orbit at 02:14 UTC. COSTAR functional tests were also completed. There was some concern about the health of the onboard HST DF-224 computer and recently installed memory and co-processor when a memory dump failed. After much analysis by a team at the GSFC, it was determined that the dump failure was due to noise on the communications link between the spacecraft and the ground.

=== Spacewalk #5 (Flight Day 8) ===
The fifth EVA began on December 9, 1993, at 03:14 UTC with a &quot;go&quot; for airlock depress over the Indian Ocean with Musgrave and Hoffman performing the EVA. Musgrave&#x27;s EVA suit failed its initial leak check, and Musgrave performed steps on the contingency checklist. He rotated the EVA suit&#x27;s lower arm joints and the suit passed two subsequent leak checks. The EVA started at 10:30 UTC and lasted 7 hours 21 minutes.

Musgrave&#x27;s and Hoffman&#x27;s first task was to replace the Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE) and they began the SADE operation while ground controllers initiated the first step in solar array deployment by commanding the Primary Drive Mechanism (PDM). &quot;Endeavour&quot; was placed in free drift to disable any RCS firings that could disrupt the solar arrays and the PDM motors were engaged at 03:48 UTC. The latches were unlocked but the arrays failed to rotate to the deploy position. No motion was detected and the STOCC sent commands to drive a single array with two motors with no success. Finally, the astronauts cranked the deployment mechanism by hand and deployment was successful. After the SADE was replaced the crew fitted an electrical connection to the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph at 08:30 UTC and it passed its functionality test. The crew then installed some covers on the magnetometers, fabricated on board by Claude Nicollier and Kenneth D. Bowersox. These covers would contain any debris caused by the older magnetometers that showed some signs of UV decay. The EVA ended at 05:51 EST bringing the total EVA time for this mission to 35 hours 28 minutes. During this flight day, Hoffman spun a dreidel in front of a live audience for the holiday of Hanukkah and brought a travel Hanukkah menorah. The HST High Gain Antenna (HGA) was deployed at 11:49 UTC and completed by 11:56 UTC. Release time for HST was set for 07:08 UTC.

=== Release of Hubble and landing ===
Flight Day 9 began on December 9, 1993, but concerns about one of HST&#x27;s four onboard Data Interface Units (DIUs) delayed release. Each of the DIUs transfer data between the HST&#x27;s main computer, solar arrays and other critical systems. A failure on Side A of DIU #2 experienced erratic current fluctuations and some data dropouts. Controllers at the STOCC and mission control came up with a troubleshooting procedure to determine the extent of the problem. HST was transferred to internal power and disconnected from its power umbilical at 04:43 UTC. Controllers then switched channels on the DIU from the A side to the B side and then back to the A side. They determined HST should be deployed. The drum brakes on the new solar array were applied to prevent them from vibrating during future observations. Claude Nicollier then took hold of the satellite with the Canadarm. The satellite was then lifted and moved away from Endeavour. The telescope&#x27;s aperture door was then reopened (a 33-minute procedure) and then released at 10:26 UTC. Commander Dick Covey and pilot Kenneth D. Bowersox fired &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s small maneuvering jets and moved the shuttle slowly away from HST. Landing of the Shuttle occurred at Kennedy Space Center on Runway 33 at 05:26 UTC on December 13, 1993.

=== Post-landing crew appearances ===
The STS-61 crew appeared in an episode of the American TV show &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Season 3, Episode 24, titled &quot;Reality Bytes&quot;, aired May 18, 1994. The Hubble repair crew appeared on the fictional Tool Time segment, where they showed some of the tools they used in space. During the closing credits, Covey also presented the cast and crew of &quot;Home Improvement&quot; with a frame containing a flag, crew patch and some photographs. The flag and patch had flown around four million miles in space.

<text>STS-58 was a NASA mission flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 18, 1993. The missions was primarily devoted to experiments concerning the physiological effects in space. This was the first in-flight use of the &quot;Portable In-flight Landing Operations Trainer&quot; (PILOT) simulation software. It was also the last time &quot;Columbia&quot; would land at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

STS-58 was a 1993 shuttle mission dedicated to life sciences research. &quot;Columbia&quot;″s crew performed a series of experiments to gain knowledge on how the human body adapts to the weightless environment of space. Experiments focused on cardiovascular, regulatory, DNA, neurovestibular and musculoskeletal systems of the body. The experiments performed on &quot;Columbia&quot;″s crew and on laboratory animals (48 rats held in 24 cages), along with data collected on the SLS-1 mission (STS-40) in June 1991, will provide the most detailed and interrelated physiological measurements acquired in the space environment since the Skylab program in 1973 and 1974.

Crew members conducted experiments aimed at understanding bone tissue loss and the effects of microgravity on sensory perception. Two neurovestibular experiments investigating space motion sickness and perception changes were performed on the 2nd day as well. Astronauts Lucid and Fettman wore a headset, called an Accelerometer Recording Unit (ARU), designed to continually record head movements throughout the day.

Only one minor issue came up on October 19, 1993, associated with a circuit breaker that tripped, cutting off power temporarily to one of the rodent cages in the module. Flight controllers in Houston reported it was not caused by a short in the electrical system and the breaker was reset, restoring power to the cage.

McArthur and Blaha began using the Lower Body Negative Pressure device on flight day 3 (FD 3), which is being tested as a countermeasure for the detrimental effects of microgravity. All three flight crew members will collect urine and saliva samples and keep logs of their exercise and food and fluid intake as part of the Energy Utilization detailed supplementary objective. DSO 612 looks at the nutritial and energy requirements of crew members on long-duration space flights and the relationship between fluid and food consumption.

On October 20, 1993, though the space toilet is working fine, the crew detected a slight leak around the filter door before going to bed. They removed the filter and cleaned up about a teaspoon of water — much less than had been expected. As a precaution, a secondary fan separator unit was used to separate fluid from the air before cycling the air back into the cabin through the filter.

On October 21, 1993, Mission specialists Margaret Rhea Seddon (Payload commander), Shannon Lucid and David Wolf and Payload specialist Martin Fettman collected additional blood and urine samples for the series of metabolic experiments. Some of the samples will follow-up on the calcium absorption experiment performed on October 20, 1993. The experiment, sponsored by Dr. C. D. Arnaud of the University of California, San Francisco, studies the mechanisms of how calcium is maintained and used in bone metabolism in space. Based on preliminary results from the 1991 SLS-1 mission (STS-40), Dr. Arnaud believes the decrease in bone density is due to increased bone breakdown that is not compensated for by a subsequent increase in bone formation.

On October 22, 1993, using the on-board ham radio called SAREX-2 for Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment, Blaha and Searfoss contacted school children at the Sycamore Middle School in Pleasant View, Tennessee, Gardendale Elementary in Pasadena, Texas and Naparima College in Trinidad and Tobago on November 4, 1993. The Standard Interface Rack (SIR), was tested by Searfoss to demonstrate that equipment can be removed from one rack location and reintegrated into another by a single crew member during orbital operations while maintaining reliable mechanical, data and power interfaces.

Another test flying aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; was the &quot;Portable In-flight Landing Operations Trainer&quot; (PILOT), a laptop computer simulator that was flown to qualify its use as a tool for helping the mission commander and pilot maintain their proficiency for approach and landing during longer duration Space Shuttle flights. The laptop was controlled using a joy stick hand controller similar to the one used to fly the orbiter in the final minutes before landing. The simulator would continue to see use up to and including the final Shuttle flight (STS-135).

On October 23, 1993, the payload crew members were scheduled to devote much of their time to metabolic studies of the 48 rodents on board the Spacelab science workshop. Payload commander Rhea Seddon, and crewmates David Wolf, Shannon Lucid and veterinarian Marty Fettman were scheduled to draw blood from the tails of some of the rodents, then inject a special isotope into the rodents to measure the volume of their plasma. Another blood draw would follow, to measure how weightlessness may be affecting the red blood cell count of the animals.

After several ham radio contacts around the country and work in a vacuum bag designed to ease the body&#x27;s readaptation to Earth&#x27;s environment, the orbiter crew made up of Commander John Blaha, Pilot Richard Searfoss and Mission specialist William McArthur oversaw a short firing of one of the orbital maneuvering system engines to drop the low end of &quot;Columbia&quot;″s orbit from to increase the landing opportunities should the mission be extended for weather or a system problem that would keep the crew in orbit two extra days.

On October 27, 1993, Pilot Rick Searfoss put &quot;Columbia&quot; through some maneuvers as part of the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE). The main goal of the experiment was to accurately measure the aerodynamic forces that act on the shuttle in orbit and during the early stages of entry. The information will be useful to scientists and engineers planning future Spacelab microgravity research flights in which experiments will need a quiet, motion-free environment to produce the best possible data. On October 28, 1993, after enjoying a half a day off, the astronauts aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; continued to collect scientific data on how humans and animals adapt to the absence of Earth&#x27;s gravity.

Payload commander Rhea Seddon sent down a special message to her husband, Astronaut Office Chief Robert L. Gibson when she surpassed his total of 632 hours, 56 minutes in space. &quot;He&#x27;s still a really good guy, I still love him a lot, but I&#x27;ve got more hours in space than he does, so there!&quot; she teased. Seddon acknowledged, however, that he has more launches and landings, having flown four times to her three.

Pilot Rick Searfoss took time out from snapping some infrared photography of the wildfires burning in southern California to say that the crew&#x27;s thoughts are with the firefighters working to quell the flames and the residents whose homes are being threatened. He said he hoped the fires would be brought under control soon, and added that the photographs he was taking will be among some 4,000 frames that will be returned to Earth for meteorologists, geologists, ecologists and archeologists to study after the flight.

<text>A terrace garden is a garden with a raised flat paved or gravelled section overlooking a . A raised terrace keeps a house dry and provides a transition between the hardscape and the softscape. 
==History==
===Persia===
Since a level site is generally regarded as a requisite for comfort and repose, the terrace as a raised viewing platform made an early appearance in the ancient Persian gardening tradition, where the enclosed orchard, or paradise, was to be viewed from a ceremonial tent. Such a terrace had its origins in the far older agricultural practice of terracing a sloping site (see Terrace (agriculture)). The Hanging Gardens of Babylon must have been built on an artificial mountain with stepped terraces, like those on a ziggurat.

===Ancient Rome===
Lucullus brought back to Rome first-hand experience of Persian gardening in the hilly sites of Asia Minor; the villa gardens of Maecenas, which included libraries open to scholars, incurred the disdain of Seneca. At Praeneste during the early Imperial period, the sanctuary of Fortuna was enlarged and elaborated, the natural slope being shaped into a series of terraces linked by stairs.

The imperial villas at Capri were built to take advantage of varied terraces. At the seaside Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, the villa gardens of Julius Caesar&#x27;s father-in-law fell away in a series of terraces, giving pleasant and varied views of the Bay of Naples. Only some of them have been excavated. At Villa of Livia, probably part of Livia Drusilla&#x27;s dowry brought to the Julio-Claudian dynasty, rooms in the cryptoporticus beneath terracing were frescoed with trees in bloom and fruit.

===Italian Renaissance===
During the Italian Renaissance, the formalized, civilizing imprint of human control over wild nature expressed in terracing that was combined with stairs and water features, drew villa patrons and garden designers to escarpments that surveyed a handsome prospect. At the influential Cortile del Belvedere at the Vatican Palace, perfected under a series of popes from the earliest 16th century, the backdrop within the enclosed court was a raised terrace. The view in this case was from the Stanze of Raphael on an upper floor of the Palace.

===English landscape garden===
Even in the most naturalistic landscape gardens of Capability Brown, a raised gravelled or paved terrace along the garden front offered a dry walk in damp weather and a transition between the hard materials of the architecture and the rolling greensward beyond.

==Contemporary==
Contemporary terrace gardens, in addition to being in the garden and landscape, often occur in urban areas and are terrace architecture elements that extend out from an apartment or residence at any floor level other than ground level. They are often discussed in conjunction with roof gardens, although they are not always actual roof gardens, instead being balconies and decks. These outdoor spaces can become lush gardens through the use of container gardening, automated drip irrigation and low-flow irrigation systems, and outdoor furnishings.

<text>Boissière () is a station of the Paris Métro serving line 6 at the intersection of the &quot;Rue Boissière&quot; and the &quot;Avenue Kleber&quot; in the 16th arrondissement.

==History==
The station opened on 2 October 1900 as a branch of line 1 from Étoile to Trocadéro. On 5 November 1903 this line was extended to Passy and the line from &quot;Étoile&quot; to &quot;Trocadéro&quot; and &quot;Passy&quot; became known as line 2 South as part of a planned ring line around central Paris to be built under or over the boulevards built in place of the demolished Wall of the Farmers-General; this circle is now operated as two lines: 2 and 6. On 12 October 1907 the line from &quot;Étoile&quot; to &quot;Trocadéro&quot;, Place d&#x27;Italie and Gare du Nord became part of line 5. On 6 October 1942 the section of line 5 from &quot;Étoile&quot; to &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot;, including &quot;Boissière&quot;, was transferred to line 6.

In 1730, &quot;Rue Boissière&quot; was a road out of the city which was an extension of the &quot;Rue de la Croix-Boissière&quot; (French for &quot;street of the wooden cross&quot;) inside Paris. Its name came from the custom of remembering the crucifixion by hanging up boxwood on Palm Sunday. The station is close to the location of the &quot;Barrière des Réservoirs&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the nineteenth century.

<text>Trocadéro () is a station on Line 6 and Line 9 of the Paris Métro in the 16th arrondissement. It serves and is named after the Place du Trocadéro.

==History==
The station opened on 2 October 1900 as a branch of Line 1 from Étoile to Trocadéro. On 5 November 1903, the line was extended to Passy; the line from Étoile to Trocadéro and Passy became known as Line 2 South as part of a planned ring line around central Paris to be built under or over the boulevards built in place of the demolished Wall of the Farmers-General; this circle is now operated as two lines: 2 and 6. On 14 October 1907, the line from Étoile to Trocadéro, Place d&#x27;Italie and Gare du Nord became part of line 5. On 6 October 1942 the section of line 5 from Étoile to Trocadéro and Place d&#x27;Italie was transferred to Line 6. The Line 9 platforms opened on 8 November 1922 as part of the first section of the line from Trocadéro to Exelmans.

The Place de Trocadéro owes its name to the fortified position in Puerto Real, on the Bay of Cadiz in the south of Spain, which was captured in the Battle of Trocadero by French troops led by Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, Charles X&#x27;s son in 1823. This name was also given to the &quot;Moorish&quot; palace built for the World Fair of 1878. The palace was demolished in 1937 and was replaced by the current &quot;Palace of Chaillot&quot;.

The station is near the &quot;Barrière Sainte-Marie&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in 1830.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has six entrances:
* Access No. 1 - &quot;Avenue du Président-Wilson&quot;;
* Access No. 2 - &quot;Avenue Kléber&quot;;

=== Station layout ===


===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. Two per stopping point, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical.

The line 6 station is decorated in the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the 2000s metro revival, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls and tunnel exits. The vault is coated and painted white. The advertising frames are made of white ceramic and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plaques. The seats are the &quot;Akiko&quot; style in green.

The platforms of line 9 are furnished in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two green light canopies, while the benches, the tunnel exits and outlets of the corridors are treated in flat green tiles and &quot;Motte&quot; seats of the same colour. This decoration is married with the white flat tiles applied to the walls and vault. The advertisements are devoid of frames and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. It is one of the few stations to still have the entire &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; layout.

The name of the station is subtitled Eiffel Tower, named after the nearby Eiffel Tower. This name appears only on the plaques placed in the corridors of line 9 (line 6 already has this subtitle for Bir-Hakeim station).

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 22, 30, 32 and 63 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by line N53 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Passy () is an above-ground station on Line 6 of the Paris Métro in the 16th arrondissement. 

The station and its approaches have notable views, as it is built on a viaduct that abuts the slope of the 25 meter high Chaillot hill just below its crest.  Eastbound trains exit the station onto the Pont de Bir-Hakim bridge over the Seine. Westbound trains enter a tunnel under the hill. The Rue Marietta-Alboni runs under the viaduct from the Seine to the foot of the slope, where it becomes two parallel sets of pedestrian stairways to the hilltop, whence the Rue resumes. The station is entered from the stairways. An upward-moving escalator parallels the northern stairway.

The metro and the stairways bisect the Square Alboni, a chic residential subdivision on the hillside whose properties were assembled and developed between 1894 and 1930. Named, like the Rue, after a famous opera contralto of the day, the Square has several buildings designed by Louis Dauvergne, with the others intended to harmonize. The buildings around the Square and the (private) park in its center, are not much visible from the platform, but can be seen from the stairways and the streets. Dauvergne also designed Les Grands Hotels du Trocadéro, the now-iconic turreted buildings on both sides of the Rue Marietta-Alboni above and below the hillside. They were built as hotels for visitors to the 1900 International Exposition and afterwards rented as apartments.
==History==
The station opened on 6 November 1903, when the branch of Line 1 from Étoile to Trocadéro that had serviced the 1900 Exposition was extended southward to this new, temporary terminus and renamed Line 2 Sud. On 24 April 1906, Line 2 Sud was extended across the Seine and the southern districts of Paris to Place d&#x27;Italie. (In 1907, the line from Etoile to Place d’Italie was incorporated into Line 5; in 1942 it was incorporated into Line 6.)

The Rue Marietta-Alboni has a width of only 15 meters (including sidewalks), as compared to the 40 meter width of the Boulevards Exterieurs over which the other elevated sections of Lines 2 and 6 were built. The land for the Rue was given to the city by the subdivision developers in 1893. 

The station was named after the nearby Quai de Passy, a riverside stretch of the road from Paris to Versailles that during the ancien régime ran near the village of Passy, located on the hilltop above the station. The Quai de Passy was renamed Avenue du President Kennedy in 1964.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two accesses from Rue Marietta-Alboni, on either side of the station, each divided into two adjoining entrances:
* access 1 - &quot;Place du Costa Rica, Maison de Balzac - Musée Georges Clemenceau&quot;, equipped with an ascending escalator complemented by fixed stairs to the road, located on the north-east side of the station to the right of Square Alboni;
* access 2 - &quot;Avenue du Président Kennedy, Maison de la Radio - Musée du Vin&quot; located on the south-west side, near the Consulate General of Algeria.

A corridor passing under the station connects these two accesses to each other.

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
Passy is a station of standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks. It has the particularity of being underground at its western end and elevated at the other end, because of the slope of the terrain. The ceiling of the first consists of a metal deck whose beams, silver in colour, are supported by vertical walls, while the rest of the platforms is sheltered by awnings supported by grey pillars. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls (the elevated part is also covered with bricks drawing geometric patterns on the outside) and the north-west tunnel exit, the opposite tunnel exit being glazed. The advertising frames are made of white ceramic and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plaques, projecting on the elevated side. The seats are yellow &quot;Motte&quot; style and lighting is provided by independent tubes. Access is mid-platform.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 32 and 72 of the RATP Bus Network.

==Nearby==
The area is a quiet, well-heeled residential neighborhood, not heavily touristed.

The Pont de Bir-Hakeim (formerly the Pont de Passy) is a road, pedestrian, and metro bridge across the Seine completed in 1906 primarily to carry the metro. In 1986 it was classified an historical monument. Opposite is the Grenelle district in the 15th arrondissement. The Île aux Cygnes midway in the Seine can be accessed by foot from the bridge.

The Parc de Passy, a public park opened in 2004 on the site of a cleared neighborhood, is 200 meters to the southwest.

The Maison de Balzac, a museum honoring the writer in a house he lived in during the 1840s, is 500 meters to the southwest.

The Maison de la Radio et de la Musique (formerly &quot;Maison de Radio France)&quot; is about 750 meters to the southwest.

The Musée Clemenceau, the apartment and garden of the French statesman, is 200 meters to the north.

The Palais de Chaillot and the Jardins du Trocadéro, opposite the Seine from the Eiffel Tower, are about 550 meters to the northeast.

Among the nearby buildings are the Majestic Passy cinema, and the Lycée Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague high school.

<text>Bir-Hakeim () is an elevated station of the Paris Métro serving line 6 in the Boulevard de Grenelle in the 15th arrondissement. It is situated on the left bank of the Pont de Bir-Hakeim over the Seine and is the closest station to the Eiffel Tower. After being built in 1906 as &quot;Grenelle&quot;, it was renamed together with the bridge to commemorate the World War II battle of Bir Hakeim. The signs on the station walls now say &quot;Bir-Hakeim — Tour Eiffel&quot;. 

The station is above the RER C line and the station Champ de Mars - Tour Eiffel is within walking distance.

==History==

The station opened as part of the former Line 2 South on 24 April 1906, when it was extended from Passy to Place d&#x27;Italie. On 14 October 1907 &quot;Line 2 South&quot; was incorporated into Line 5. It was incorporated into line 6 on 12 October 1942. The station was called &quot;Quai de Grenelle&quot; until 18 June 1949, when it was renamed to commemorate the battle of Bir Hakeim. A commemorative panel is situated at the entrance of the platform for trains traveling towards Nation. The station was the location of the &quot;Barrière de la Cunette&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the nineteenth century.

==Passenger services==

===Access===
The station has three entrances established on the central median of the Boulevard de Grenelle:
* access 1 - &quot;Rue Nélaton&quot; leading to the right of numbers 6 and 11 of the boulevard near the former street;
* access 2 - &quot;Place des Martyrs-Juifs - Tour Eiffel&quot; opposite the Place des Martyrs-Juifs-du-Vélodrome-d&#x27;Hiver, to the right of Nos. 2 and 3 of the boulevard;
* access 3 - &quot;Boulevard de Grenelle&quot; is located opposite nos. 2 and 3 of the boulevard.
Each opens onto a communal area under the viaduct from which access to the platforms is via fixed stairs, escalators, or elevators.

===Station layout===

===Platform===
Bir-Hakeim is an elevated station with a standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks, all covered by a glass roof in the marquee style of the stations of the time. The vertical walls are covered with bevelled white ceramic tiles on the inside, and bricks with geometric patterns on the outside. The advertising frames are made of white ceramic and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plaques. The seats are a white &quot;Motte&quot; style arranged on convex-shaped benches covered with flat white ceramic tiles. The lighting is semi-direct, projected on the floor by blue ceiling lights, on the walls by partially concealed lighting tubes and on the framework by blue light projectors.

When it was renovated in 2008, the station received a work by the American visual artist Judy Ledgerwood, &quot;Night and Day&quot;. It is a double stained-glass window placed on the glass roof above the tracks at each end of the station. The work was offered to the RATP in exchange for a Guimard entrance for the Van Buren Street station of the Chicago subway.

===Other connections===
The station connects to the Champ de Mars–Tour Eiffel station on RER C line via an underground connecting corridor.

In addition, it is served by line 30 of the RATP Bus Network.

==Places of interest==

It is the station closest to the Eiffel Tower. Near the station is the site of the former Vélodrome d&#x27;hiver (Winter Velodrome or &quot;Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv&quot;), which was famous for its cycling competitions but became infamous as the first place of detention for thousands of Parisian Jews who were rounded up by the police on 16 and 17 July 1942 before their deportation to Nazi concentration camps. The velodrome was destroyed in 1960 in the course of work done on the bank of the Seine (Front de Seine). A commemorative monument has been raised near the south side of the station, above the tracks of the RER C.

In the film &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, Maria Schneider&#x27;s character has an argument which leads to a physical altercation with her boyfriend in the Bir-Hakeim station.

<doc id="504325" wikidata="Q193370" url="?curid=504325" title="Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis">
<text>Montreuil (), also known unofficially as Montreuil-sous-Bois (), is a commune in the eastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris, in the Seine-Saint-Denis department and in the Métropole du Grand Paris. With a population of 111,367 as of 2020, Montreuil is the third most populous suburb of Paris after Boulogne-Billancourt and Saint-Denis. It is located north of Paris&#x27;s Bois de Vincennes (in the 12th arrondissement), on the border with Val-de-Marne.

==Name==
The name Montreuil was recorded for the first time in a royal edict of 722 as , meaning &quot;little monastery&quot; in Medieval Latin. The settlement of Montreuil started as a group of houses built around a small Merovingian monastery.

==History==
A small monastery was recorded on the site during the Merovingian period on a hill that overlooked Vincennes, which is most likely where Montreuil gained its name.

Under the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XVI the &quot;Peach Walls&quot; which provided the royal court with the fruits were located in Montreuil. It was also later home to the Lumière brothers and George Méliès whose workshops were located in lower Montreuil.

On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, the commune of Charonne was disbanded and divided between the city of Paris, Montreuil, and Bagnolet. Montreuil received a small part of the territory of Charonne.

Today Montreuil is divided into several districts:

* Le bas Montreuil (which joins together the old workshops (bordering on Saint-Mandé), the &quot;marché aux puces&quot; (bordering on Paris, carries of Montreuil),
* The Mairie (the malls, la croix de Chavaux, the Hôtel de Ville (town hall), and the Church of St Peter and St Paul),
* La Noue (parc des Guilands, city of du Val, Robespierre, bordering on Bagnolet),
* Le Bel Air (Jean Moulin housing estate, park des Beaumonts, city of Bel Air, city of Grand Pechers),
* La Boissière (all the north of Montreuil including parc Montreau and parc des Beaumonts, bordering on Romainville, Noisy-le-Sec, Rosny-sous-Bois and Fontenay-sous-Bois).

===Main artistic heritage===
* Decorations (ceramics and frescoes) in the state school &quot;Voltaire&quot; by Maurice Boitel (1954).
* Many definitive street art murals on several buildings of the city, like the tribute to Frantz Fanon, French psychiatrist and philosopher from the French overseas department of Martinique (boulevard Théophile Sueur). 
* &quot;Au temps d&#x27;harmonie&quot;, pointillist painting from famous 19th century French painter Paul Signac, in the town hall.
* Polyptych (enamels), in the cathedral entrance of the Georges Méliès student residence by Guillaume Bottazzi.

<text>Nicholas Constantine Metropolis (Greek: ; June 11, 1915 – October 17, 1999) was a Greek-American physicist.

Metropolis received his BSc (1937) and PhD in physics (1941, with Robert Mulliken) at the University of Chicago. Shortly afterwards, Robert Oppenheimer recruited him from Chicago, where he was collaborating with Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller on the first nuclear reactors, to the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

He arrived in Los Alamos in April 1943, as a member of the original staff of fifty scientists. He came back to Los Alamos in 1948 to lead the group in the Theoretical Division that designed and built the MANIAC I computer in 1952 that was modeled on the IAS machine, and the MANIAC II in 1957.

== Early life and education ==
Nicolas Metropolis was born on June 11, 1915, in Chicago, US. Metropolis received his BSc (1936) and PhD in chemical physics (1941) at the University of Chicago. During his PhD he worked with Robert Mulliken. After graduation, he worked as an instructor at the University of Chicago with James Franck. Shortly afterwards, in 1943, Robert Oppenheimer recruited him from Chicago for the Manhattan Project, where he worked in Harold C. Urey&#x27;s group. Later he joined University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory and worked under Edward Teller&#x27;s supervision, who encouraged him to move into theoretical physics. At Los Alamos Metropolis worked together with Richard Feynman on &quot;electromechanical devices used for hand computations&quot;.

==After World War II==
After World War II, he returned to the faculty of the University of Chicago as an assistant professor. He came back to Los Alamos in 1948 to lead the group in the theoretical division that designed and built the MANIAC I computer in 1952 that was modeled on the IAS machine, and the MANIAC II in 1957. (John von Neumann thought this acronym too frivolous; Metropolis claims to have chosen the name &quot;MANIAC&quot; in the hope of stopping the rash of such acronyms for machine names, but may have instead further stimulated such use.) From 1957 to 1965 he was a full professor of physics at the University of Chicago and was the founding director of its Institute for Computer Research. In 1965 he returned to Los Alamos, where he was made a laboratory senior fellow in 1980.

==Monte Carlo method==
At Los Alamos in the late 1940s and early 1950s a group of researchers led by Metropolis, including John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam, developed the Monte Carlo method. This is a class of computational approaches that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results, named in reference to Ulam&#x27;s relative&#x27;s love for the casinos of Monte Carlo. Metropolis was deeply involved in the very first use of the Monte Carlo method, rewiring the ENIAC computer to perform simulations of a nuclear core in 1948. In 1953 Metropolis was credited as a co-author of a paper entitled &quot;Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines&quot;. This landmark paper showed the first numerical simulations of a liquid and introduced a new Monte Carlo computational method for doing so.

In applications of the Monte Carlo method to problems in statistical mechanics prior to the introduction of the Metropolis algorithm, a large number of random configurations of the system would be generated, the properties of interest (such as energy or density) would be computed for each configuration, and then a weighted average computed where the weight of each configuration was its Boltzmann factor, formula_1, where formula_2 is the energy, formula_3 is the temperature, and formula_4 is the Boltzmann constant. The key contribution of the paper was the idea that

The algorithm for generating samples from the Boltzmann distribution was later generalized by W.K. Hastings and has become widely known as the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.

In recent years a controversy has arisen as to whether Metropolis actually made significant contributions to the &quot;Equation of State Calculations &quot;paper.

==Associations and honors==
Metropolis was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and the American Mathematical Society. In 1987 he became the first Los Alamos employee honored with the title &quot;emeritus&quot; by the University of California. Metropolis was also awarded the Pioneer Medal by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and was a fellow of the American Physical Society.

The Nicholas Metropolis Award for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Work in Computational Physics is awarded annually by the American Physical Society.

==Acting career==
Metropolis played the part of a scientist in the Woody Allen film &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992).

==Personal life==
Metropolis had a son, Christopher, and two daughters, Penelope and Katharine. He was an avid skier and tennis player until his mid-seventies. He died at a nursing home in Los Alamos, New Mexico.

==Anecdotes==
In his memoirs, Stanislaw Ulam remembers that a small group, including himself, Metropolis, Calkin, Konopinski, Kistiakowsky, Teller and von Neumann, spent several evenings at Los Alamos playing poker. They played for very small sums, but: &quot;Metropolis once described what a triumph it was to win ten dollars from John von Neumann, author of a famous treatise on game theory. He then bought his book for five dollars and pasted the other five inside the cover as a symbol of his victory.&quot; In another passage of his book, Ulam describes Metropolis as &quot;a Greek-American with a wonderful personality.&quot;

==Erdős number==
Metropolis has an Erdős number of 2 and he enabled Richard Feynman to have an Erdős number of 3.

*1993 Audio Interview with Nicholas Metropolis by Richard Rhodes Voices of the Manhattan Project
* Oral history interview with Nicholas C. Metropolis, Conducted by William Aspray at Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota. Metropolis, the first director of computing services at Los Alamos National Laboratory, discusses John von Neumann&#x27;s work in computing. Most of the interview concerns activity at Los Alamos: how von Neumann came to consult at the laboratory; his scientific contacts there, including Metropolis, Robert Richtmyer, and Edward Teller; von Neumann&#x27;s first hands-on experience with punched card equipment; his contributions to shock-fitting and the implosion problem; interactions between and comparisons of von Neumann and Enrico Fermi; and the development of Monte Carlo techniques. Other topics include: the relationship between Alan Turing and von Neumann; work on numerical methods for non-linear problems; and the ENIAC calculations done for Los Alamos.

<text>La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle () is a station of the Paris Métro, at the interconnection of line 6, line 8, and line 10 in the 15th arrondissement. The station combines underground and elevated platforms. It is a major métro interchange on the Rive Gauche, the biggest west of Montparnasse.

==History==

The elevated station first opened on 24 April 1906 under the name &quot;La Motte-Piquet,&quot; as part of the extension of line 2 South from Passy to Place d&#x27;Italie. It was named after the nearby avenue de La Motte-Picquet, after Admiral Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de La Motte (1720–1791), and boulevard de Grenelle, a former commune until it was annexed by Paris in 1860.

On 14 October 1907, line 2 South was incorporated into line 5, which now plied between &quot;Étoile&quot; (now Charles de Gaulle–Étoile) and Lancry (now Jacques Bonsergent)

On 13 July 1913, line 8&#x27;s platforms opened as part of the initial section of the line from &quot;Beaugrenelle&quot; (now Charles Michels) and Opéra. On the same day, the station was renamed &quot;La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle&quot;, which it still remains today. These are the current platforms served by lines 8 towards &quot;Créteil&quot; and 10 towards &quot;Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz&quot;. It was originally intended for line 8 to run from &quot;Opéra&quot; with two branches, one to &quot;Porte d&#x27;Auteuil&quot; and the other to &quot;Balard&quot;, with the line branching from &quot;La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle&quot;. Hence, the island platform was designed to accommodate trains coming from both branches then onwards to &quot;Opéra&quot;. The platform used today for line 10&#x27;s service to &quot;Boulogne&quot; would have been the southbound platform for service to the two branches, although this had not been built yet.

From 17 May to 6 December 1931, the section between &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot; and &quot;Étoile&quot; of line 5 was temporarily transferred to line 6 to provide service to the colonial exhibition held at Bois de Vincennes that year. It was eventually returned to line 5.

The section of line 8 from &quot;La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle&quot; to Porte d&#x27;Auteuil was transferred to line 10 on 27 July 1937 when line 8 was extended south to Balard. However, service between Porte d&#x27;Auteuil and Jussieu was not provided with service initially limited to La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle until the underground connection for line 10 was opened linking &quot;La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle&quot; and Duroc two days later. This was part of the reconfiguration of lines 8, 10, and the old line 14. The platform for line 8&#x27;s services to Balard was built beneath the existing platforms due to the narrow confines of the streets above. Line 8&#x27;s platforms on the island platform were extended to 105 m to cater for seven-car trains in the future, although the plan did not materialise in the end.

On 6 October 1942, the section of line 5 between &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot; and &quot;Étoile&quot;, including &quot;La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle,&quot; was transferred back to line 6 in anticipation of the opening of the extension of line 5 to Eglise de Pantin on 12 October that same year. This was to prevent line 5 from becoming too long.

In 1969, the platform used for line 8 services to &quot;Balard&quot; was renovated in the &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; style with its characteristic orange coloured tiles instead of the typical bevelled white tiles used extensively elsewhere in the network.

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the access corridors to line 6 were renovated in 2007 along with its platforms in 2008. The platform used for line 8 services to &quot;Balard&quot; was also renovated in 2014, removing the &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; style decoration on the side wall of the platform (the side walls of the tracks still retains it), bringing back the use of the white tiles. From 1 July to 31 August 2020, the station was closed to replace their asphalt flooring with anthracite gray tiling along the access corridors to line 6 as well as the platforms of lines 8 and 10. In 2022, some of the staircases in the station were installed with street art by artist Chris Puddy.

In 2019, the station was used by 7,958,383 passengers, making it the 30th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 3,428,458 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 44th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 5,117,708 passengers, making it the 34th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

==Passenger services==

===Access===
The station has five accesses:

*Access 1: rue de Commerce
*Access 2: avenue de La Motte-Picquet (with an escalator)
*Access 3: boulevard de Grenelle
*Access 4: rue de Pondichéry (access to lines 8 and 10 only)
*Access 5: avenue de Suffren (access to lines 8 and 10 only)

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
Line 6&#x27;s station is elevated and has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. On the other hand, the underground platforms for lines 8 and 10 have a unique configuration. 

On the upper level are the tracks of lines 8 and 10 both heading east on either side of an island platform, measuring 105 m (line 8) and 75 m (line 10) respectively, as well as the track of line 10 in the direction of &quot;Boulogne&quot; located in a half-station separated by a wall on the east of the island platform, comprising a single track with a side platform measuring 105 m in length, a feature unique on the line. The island platform is contained in an elliptical vault, except for the northeast end of the platform for line 8 when it was extended in 1937. It has a horizontal ceiling painted white.

On the lower level is a half station for line 8 services to &quot;Balard&quot;, also with a single platform and track and is 105 m long. It has almost entirely vertical side walls and a low, flat ceiling, inclined towards the platform, barring the northeastern end which has a slightly higher elliptical vault. The side walls are also clad with flat white tiles arranged vertically instead of in staggered rows like most other stations on the métro, a feature only found at Père Lachaise on line 2 and at Gare du Nord on line 4 (until 2017).

===Other connections===
The station is also served by lines 80 and 82 of the RATP bus network.

<doc id="504330" wikidata="Q3595074" url="?curid=504330" title="The Discovery of India">
<text>The Discovery of India was written by the Indian freedom fighter Jawaharlal Nehru (later India&#x27;s first Prime Minister) during his incarceration in 1942–1945 at Ahmednagar Fort in present-day Indian state of Maharashtra by British colonial authorities before the independence of India. The book was written in 1944 but published in 1946.

==Synopsis==
The journey in &quot;The Discovery of India&quot; begins from ancient history, leading up to the last years of the British Raj. Nehru uses his knowledge of the Upanishads, Vedas, and textbooks on ancient history to introduce to the reader the development of India from the Indus Valley civilization, through the changes in socio-political scenario every foreign invader brought, to the present day conditions. Nehru was jailed for his participation in the Quit India Movement along with other Indian leaders, and he used this time to write down his thoughts and knowledge about India&#x27;s history. The book provides a broad view of Indian history, philosophy, and culture as viewed from the eyes of an Indian fighting for the independence of his country. He wrote the book during his imprisonment.

==Other contributors==

Nehru attributes some of the content of the book to his fellow prisoners at Ahmednagar jail. He gives special mention to four of them namely Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Govind Ballabh Pant, Narendra Deva and Asaf Ali. All his fellow prisoners (eleven of them) were political prisoners from various parts of the country, having deep knowledge about the various aspects of India which the book discusses. They also participated in proofreading Nehru&#x27;s work and providing him with creative suggestions.

==Edition ==
The book was first published from Signet Press at Calcutta (now Kolkata), India on March 1946.
The book is presently published by the &#x27;Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund&#x27; and the copyright for the book is held by his grand daughter-in-law Sonia Gandhi.

* &quot;The Discovery of India&quot; by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, 
* &quot;The Discovery of India&quot; by Jawaharlal Nehru (paperback, thirteenth edition), 

==Adaptations==
The book became the basis of the 53-episode Indian television series &quot;Bharat Ek Khoj&quot; (1988), directed by Shyam Benegal, first broadcast in 1988 on state-run Doordarshan channel. A modified version of this book is taught as a Hindi supplement in 8th grade.

==City symbols==
Motosu city&#x27;s tree is the persimmon tree, which is found growing naturally in the mountainous areas of Motosu. As persimmons are also cultivated in Motosu, it was chosen to represent the agricultural industry in the area.

The city flower is the usuzumi cherry blossom found in the recently merged Neo. This unique cherry blossom initially sprouts pale pink flowers, which become white in full bloom, and a light black colour when the flowers die. Neo is also home to one of the three largest cherry blossom trees in Japan, which is reported to be the oldest cherry blossom tree in Japan.

&quot;Ayu&quot; or sweetfish, has been chosen to be the representative fish of the city. Known as &quot;the queen of clear streams&quot;, the fish is found in the Neo River that flows through Motosu. Highly regarded for its flavour in Japan, it is fished throughout summer in the rivers.

The Motosu city bird is the &quot;uguisu&quot; or Japanese bush warbler, found in shrub thickets throughout Motosu. The bush warbler is known for its greenish brown colouring on its back, and white belly. Female birds can also be recognised by their dash pattern on their backs. It is also known as the &quot;flower-viewing&quot; bird, for its appearance near the many cherry blossom trees in the area.

In order to commemorate the three-year anniversary Motosu-city&#x27;s amalgamation of Itonuki, Neo, Shinsei and Motosu, the municipal government began working on a theme song that best represented their vision of the future. The lyrics of the theme song, &quot;Habataite&quot;, are intended to convey the ideas of nature and people living harmoniously together. The song is played every afternoon on the loudspeakers to warn children to return home before nightfall. The music was written by the world-renowned ocarina player Soujirou, who was commissioned by the local city government to write the theme song.

==History==
The area around Motosu was part of traditional Mino Province. During the Edo period, much of the area was under the control of Ogaki Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. In the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, Motosu District in Gifu Prefecture was created.

<doc id="504335" wikidata="Q3169073" url="?curid=504335" title="Jean-Pierre Brard">
<text>Jean-Pierre Brard (born 7 February 1948), is a French politician. He was formerly the deputy mayor of the city of Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, later being elected mayor in 1984. A former member of the French Communist Party (until 1996), he is affiliated to the parliamentary group of the Democratic and Republican Left. He is known for his anti-cult and secular activism.

== Early life ==
Jean-Pierre Brard was born 7 February 1948, in Flers, Orne, France.

== Political career ==
He entered politics and was elected was deputy mayor of Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, a post he held until 1984 when he was elected mayor of the same city. He remained mayor until March 2008. He ran again for this post later.

He is a member of the Convention for a Progressive Alternative (CAP) and a deputy to the French National Assembly since 1988. A former member of the French Communist Party (until 1996), he is affiliated to the parliamentary group of the Democratic and Republican Left. He is a member of the Parliamentary Office for evaluation of scientific and technological options, and he participates in various task forces and commissions on sects, the economy and finance. In February 2005 he convinced all but one of the present members of the National Assembly present across the political spectrum to support an amendment making education about religious a school educational component in public schools.

== Anti-cult and secular activism ==
Brard is known for his anti-cult and secular stance,&quot;&quot; for which he has been involved in several legal battles. He is particularly known for his opposition to Protestant groups. He was the vice-president of the Guyard Commission into cults in 1995. In 1999, he wrote the &quot;Sects and Money&quot; report alongside Jacques Guyard, published by a different French parliamentary commission dedicated to investigating the financial status of cults.

In 1998 he was sued by the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses; Brard had been one of the leading actors in the French state&#x27;s attempt to control the group. He was sued for claiming that the group was responsible for many suicides; it was ruled that though the statement was defamatory it did not constitute &quot;religious bias&quot;, resulting in his acquittal. He was sued again by them in 2006, after Brard said their denial of blood transfusions resulted in people&#x27;s deaths, that they did not pay taxes, and that they covered up serious in-group crimes; this was ruled defamatory but as the statement was deemed to have been made in &quot;good faith&quot; he was again acquitted.

In June 1999 he and Guyard were both sued following Guyard&#x27;s negative statement on a television show about the group Anthroposophy. Both men&#x27;s lawyers plead parliamentary immunity as a result of their work on the commission, which was invoked by Brard. In 2001, the Court of Appeal of Paris ruled that while Brard had in fact made defamatory statements, as he had chaired the commission for the Sects and Money report it had been done in good faith and was not guilty. Brard was then sued by the group Landmark Education in 2004, which he had deemed a cult, following his appearance in the 2004 television documentary &quot;Voyage to the Land of the New Gurus.&quot; The host of the program had questioned Brard over his deeming Landmark a cult without having researched them, to which Brard responded that they were a cult because the program of Landmark made one &quot;relinquish critical thought&quot;, and that it was merely done to gain money.

In his most notorious legal battle, in 2005, a Montreuil church (with residents mostly from Zaire and Haiti) was deemed too loud by local residents, who complained to Brard. Brard, according to eyewitnesses, barged into the church and told them &quot;Stop! What you are doing is not rational! There is no God! You must stop!&quot; For this action he was condemned by the president of the Protestant Federation of France, who called his actions a menace and also illegal. The president of the École pratique des hautes études stated in response that &quot;Not since the maréchal of MacMahon during the crisis of May 16 under the Third Republic have we seen in France a public official interrupting an act of worship.&quot; The next year, in an unrelated incident, he was found guilty of religious discrimination and fined , in addition to in court costs and damages, after he cut the microphone of an alderman during a council meeting and claimed that her wearing of a Catholic cross violated laïcité.

<text>Saint-Jacques () is a station on Line 6 of the Paris Métro. It serves Place Saint-Jacques in the 14th arrondissement. The Boulevard Saint-Jacques and Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Jacques also intersect the square. It is one of only a few Métro stations that have a combined entrance and ticket hall at street-level.

==Location==
The station is located in the middle of the Boulevard Saint-Jacques, at the intersection with the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Jacques and Rue de la Tombe-Issoire.

==History==
The station opened as part of the former Line 2 South on 24 April 1906, when it was extended from Passy to Place d&#x27;Italie. On 14 October 1907, Line 2 South was incorporated into Line 5. It was incorporated into Line 6 on 12 October 1942.

Saint-Jacques station was one of a number of Paris locations of Stanley Donen&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;Charade&quot;, starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn.

==Name==
The station is named after the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Jacques, which was originally the Roman road to Orléans and main street of the Roman city of Lutetia. In the Middle Ages it became the pilgrimage route of St James (French: &quot;Saint-Jacques&quot;) from Paris to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Hence the street inside Paris&#x27; wall became known as Rue Saint-Jacques and its extension outside the wall through suburban development (French: &quot;Faubourg&quot;), became known as the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Jacques. The station was the location of the &quot;Barrière Saint-Jacques&quot; (known as the &quot;Barrière d&#x27;Arcueil&quot; during the French Revolution), a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the nineteenth century.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The only access to the station is on the central Boulevard Saint-Jacques, at the junction with the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Jacques and La Tombe-Issoire. It is one of the few stations to have an edicule above the tracks, from which one accesses the public road and to the platforms.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Saint-Jacques is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by metro tracks. On the other hand, it is distinguished by its location, on ground-level, and its decoration. In the direction of Charles de Gaulle–Étoile, the tracks enter underground at the exit of the station, while, towards Nation, they rise above the ground. The station is therefore aerial and the platforms are equipped with canopies supported by poles located in the middle of the platforms. The lighting is made by means of simple fluorescent tubes. The right walls are exposed stone protected by a backlit glazing. The name of the station, also backlit, is written with Parisine font. The seats are &quot;Motte&quot; style, gray, installed on circular masonry benches covered with flat gray tiles. This tiling also covered the ground until 2018 when it was replaced by asphalt. The platforms do not have advertising. This development is a unique case on the network.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 64, 216 and Orlybus of the RATP Bus Network.

==Places of interest==
Nearby are the La Santé Prison and the Institut d&#x27;astrophysique de Paris.

<text>Quai de la Gare () is a station on Line 6 of the Paris Métro. It is located at the intersection of the Quai de la Gare and Boulevard Vincent Auriol, in the 13th arrondissement.

==History==

The station opened on 1 March 1909 with the opening of the original section of Line 6 from Place d&#x27;Italie to Nation (although part of Line 5—some dating back to 2 October 1900—was incorporated into Line 6 on 12 October 1942). It is named after the Quai de la Gare on the Rive Gauche of the Seine, which was a wharf opened in 1770 and serving the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. Nearby was the location of the &quot;Barrière de la Gare&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in 1819.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du metro&quot; program, the station was completely renovated in the 2000s. In 2021, attendance is gradually rising, with 1,735,465 passengers entering this station, placing it in the 202nd position of metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two accesses leading to either side of the central median of Boulevard Vincent-Auriol:
* Access 1 - &quot;Avenue de France&quot; located to the right of nos. 11 and 12 of the boulevard;
* Access 2 - &quot;Pont de Bercy&quot; facing nos. 1 and 2 of the boulevard.
Each opens onto a communal area under the viaduct from where access to the platforms is by means of fixed stairs, escalators, or elevators.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Quai de la Gare is an elevated station of standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks, all established in a very slight curve and covered with a glass roof. The vertical walls are covered with bevelled white ceramic tiles on the inside, and bricks layered in geometric patterns on the outside. The advertising frames are made of white ceramic and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plaques. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are white and arranged on convex benches covered with flat white ceramic tiles. The lighting is semi-direct, projected on the ground by blue ceiling lights, on the walls by partially concealed tubes and on the frame by blue light projectors. Access is via the eastern end.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 61, 71, 89, 215 and 325 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N131 and N133 of the Noctilien bus network.

==Nearby==
Nearby are the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and AccorHotels Arena, although best served by the next station towards Nation, Bercy, which Line 6 reaches by crossing the Pont de Bercy.

<text>Noisy-le-Grand () is a commune in the eastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris. The commune of Noisy-le-Grand is part of the sector of Porte de Paris, one of the four sectors of the &quot;new town&quot; of Marne-la-Vallée.

Some of the postmodern architecture in the commune has been used as a shooting location in movies including &quot;Brazil&quot; and &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;.

==Name==
The name Noisy comes from Medieval Latin &quot;nucetum&quot;, meaning &quot;walnut grove&quot;, after the walnut trees () covering the territory of Noisy-le-Grand in ancient times.

The epithet &quot;le-Grand&quot; (Medieval Latin: &quot;Magnum&quot;), meaning &quot;the Great&quot;, was added in the Middle Ages, probably to distinguish Noisy-le-Grand from the smaller settlement of Noisy-le-Sec, which was sometimes referred to as &quot;Nucenum Minus&quot; (&quot;Noisy the Small&quot;).

==Demographics==
Like many other Seine-Saint-Denis cities, the commune is very cosmopolitan, home of many communities, with many of its locals coming from various continents and countries. It has a large African population, mostly from sub-Saharan countries (Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast and many others) and East Asian countries, such as China, Vietnam and Cambodia. The city also includes significant, but less numerous, communities from Portugal and North African countries like Morocco and Algeria. Recently, the department, and the Parisian suburbs in general, has seen a new wave of immigration coming from Eastern Europe. Noisy-le-Grand now has communities from former Eastern Bloc countries like Romania, Bulgaria and Russia.

As of 1998 there were 2,700 East Asians in Noisy le Grand, making up about 5-6% of the city; many of them lived in the same complexes occupied by Africans and other foreigners, and Asians were widely distributed around the commune.

==Administration==
The canton of Noisy-le-Grand comprises two communes: Noisy-le-Grand and Gournay-sur-Marne.

==Economy==
Previously Star Airlines (now XL Airways France) had its headquarters in the Immeuble Horizon building in the commune. Cédric Pastrour, the founder of the airline, said that the company chose the Noisy site because the airline did not yet know which airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport or Orly Airport, would serve as the airline&#x27;s base, and that the Noisy site was equidistant to both airports. Pastour added that the Noisy site had access to the A4 and the A86 autoroutes and was close to the Francilienne, and that the costs in the Noisy area were lower than the costs in the airport area.

==Education==
The commune has municipal preschools and elementary schools.

Junior high schools:
* Collège du Clos Saint-Vincent
* Collège François-Mitterrand
* Collège Françoise-Cabrini
* Collège international
* Collège Jacques-Prévert
* Collège Saint-Exupéry
* Collège Victor-Hugo

Senior high schools/sixth form colleges:

*Lycée Flora-Tristan (Noisy-le-Grand)
*Lycée Françoise-Cabrini (Noisy-le-Grand)
*Lycée International de l&#x27;Est Parisien  (Noisy-le-Grand)

==Transport==
Noisy-le-Grand is served by two stations on Paris RER line A: Noisy-le-Grand–Mont d&#x27;Est station and Noisy–Champs station.

Noisy-le-Grand is also served by Les Yvris–Noisy-le-Grand station on Paris RER line E.

<doc id="504351" wikidata="Q415416" url="?curid=504351" title="Karen National Union">
<text>The Karen National Union (; abbreviated KNU) is a political organisation with an armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), that claims to represent the Karen people of Myanmar. It operates in mountainous eastern Myanmar and has underground networks in other areas of Myanmar where Karen people live as a minority group.

Some of the Karen, led primarily by the Karen National Union (KNU), have waged a war against the central government since early 1949. The aim of the KNU at first was independence. Since 1976 the armed group has called for a federal system rather than an independent Karen State.

The Karen conflict is the second longest internal war in the world after the Dagohoy rebellion in the Philippines, having been waged for 85 years until 1829.

==History==
===1947 – 1959===
The KNU was founded in 1947. Following Myanmar&#x27;s independence in January 1948, KNU leaders instructed local organisers to establish local defence militias, collectively grouped under the Karen National Defence Organisation in their districts. The KNU launched its armed campaign against the Myanma government in early 1949.

By the early 1950s, factions within Karen politics were influencing the strategic posture of the KNU. In 1953, Mahn Ba Zan and other KNU leaders established the Karen National Unity Party (KNUP), a communist-influenced group that supported a shift leftward in KNU politics.

===1960 – 1969===
By 1960, KNUP members had become the dominant figures within KNU structures, despite the KNUP being a &quot;minority&quot; tendency within Karen politics, as described by Paul D. Kenny. The KNUP was strongest in the Irrawaddy Delta.

Under KNUP influence, the KNU was centralised, the KNLA was reorganised along Maoist lines, and agricultural cooperatives were created in some KNU-controlled villages.

By 1963, the KNU numbered approximately 10,000.

As the KNU trended leftward internally, its outward posture was complicated by the broader alignment of forces within Myanmar. Chinese support for the Communist Party of Burma – a rival of the KNU – led the organisation into a tacit understanding with the Kuomintang, which had been displaced into northern Myanmar following defeat in the Chinese Civil War.

Ideological and strategic disagreement precipitated the breaking away of senior figure Tha Hmwe in April 1963, with approximately 400 men, to found the Karen Revolutionary Council (KRC). The KRC was wound-up following Tha Hmwe&#x27;s capture in 1964.

In KNU-controlled territory along the Thai border, a more successful reaction against the KNUP influence within the KNU took place. These areas, at some distance from KNUP strength in the Irrawaddy Delta, had come under the sway of S&#x27;gaw Karen figures, especially commanders Shwe Hser and Bo Mya.

In 1966, Bo Mya – then head of the Karen Armed Force&#x27;s Eastern Division – seized control of the Dawna Range and much of the Thai border region and ordered KNUP cadres to leave his territory. Bo Mya was able to maintain an army approximately 10,000 men by taxing illegal trade along the border with Thailand.

In 1967, Mahn Ba Zan and four other senior KNUP officials reconciled with Bo Mya, forming the Karen National Unity Front (KNUF). This reconciliation paved the way both for Bo Mya&#x27;s ultimate ascension to KNU presidency in 1976.

===1970 – 1999===
By 1970, following KNUP military defeats in the Irrawaddy Delta, the KNU had become the dominant representative body for the Karen Movement.

The 9th KNU congress was held in September 1974, and the 11th KNU congress was held in 1995.

Bo Mya dominated the KNU leadership for three decades from 1976 to 2000. For many years, the KNU was able to fund its activities by controlling black market trade across the border with Thailand, and through local taxation. After the failed 8888 Uprising of the Myanmar people in 1988, the Myanmar military government turned to China for help in consolidating its power. Various economic concessions were offered to China in exchange for weapons. The Myanmar Army was massively expanded and began to offer deals to groups fighting the government. The groups were offered the choice of co-operating with the military junta or being destroyed.

In 1994, a group of Buddhist soldiers in the KNLA, citing discrimination by the KNU&#x27;s overwhelmingly Christian leadership against the Buddhist Karen majority, broke away and established the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA). They were led by U Thuzana, an influential Karen monk. The DKBA quickly agreed to a ceasefire with the Myanmar army and was granted business concessions at the expense of the KNU . The KNU and DKBA have since been in regular fighting, with the DKBA actively supported by the Myanmar army.

The KNU&#x27;s effectiveness was severely diminished after its headquarters were captured in the Fall of Manerplaw, near the Thai border, in 1995.

===2000 – 2009===
The 12th KNU congress was held in 2000, the 13th KNU congress was held from 12 to 16 December 2005, and the 14th KNU congress was held from 6 to 20 October 2008.

Padoh Mahn Sha La Phan, the secretary-general of the union was shot dead in his home in Mae Sot, Thailand, on 14 February 2008, possibly by soldiers of the DKBA.

In 2009, the KNU&#x27;s fighting force was reduced to around 3000 to 5000 soldiers, and on 25 June 2009 the KNLA&#x27;s Brigade 7 headquarters was overrun.

===2010 – present===
On 2 November 2010, the Karen National Union became a member of an alliance which included the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), the Chin National Front (CNF), the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), the New Mon State Party (NMSP) and the Shan State Army North (SSA-N).

In January 2012, Myanmar&#x27;s military-backed civilian government signed a ceasefire deal with the KNU in Hpa-an, the capital of eastern Kayin State. Aung Min, the Railway Minister, and General Mutu Sae Poe of the KNU led the peace talks.

In March 2012, a senior political leader of KNU, P&#x27;doh Mahn Nyein Maung, was found guilty of high treason under the Illegal Association Act, for his involvement with the Karen rebellion and sentenced to 20 years. He was freed soon afterward and sent back to Thailand.

The Karen National Union held its 15th congress at Lay Wah on 26 November 2012. This meeting was held at a pivotal moment in the KNU&#x27;s history, as it occurred at a time of political in-fighting in regards to how the KNU should negotiate a ceasefire agreement with the Myanmar government.

From 30 October to 2 November 2013, an unprecedented meeting took place at the Kachin Independence Organisation headquarters in Laiza. For the first time, representatives of 17 armed ethnic opposition groups were able to meet in Myanmar with the consent of the government. The conference resulted in the formation of a 13-member Nationwide Ceasefire Coordinating Team (NCCT) and the signing of an &quot;11-Point Common Position of Ethnic Resistance Organisations on Nationwide Ceasefire&quot; or the Laiza Agreement. The NCCT&#x27;s current mandate was to take responsibility on writing the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement based on mutual understanding between the different armed groups in the NCCT. At the Law Khee Lah Conference, it was agreed that the NCCT had the mandate to discuss and change the document technically, except at the policy level. When the final document was ready, the respective ethnic organisation leaders decided and discussed with the Union Peacemaking Working Committee (UPWC) on the nationwide ceasefire.

On 15 October 2015, the KNU signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) with the government of Myanmar, along with several other insurgent groups.

In September 2016, KNLA fighters began clashing with members of the Mon National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the New Mon State Party (NMSP), in the Tanintharyi Region. Both the KNU and NMSP were signatories of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) at the time of the fighting. A temporary bilateral truce was reached between the two groups on 14 March 2018.

Tensions between the KNU and the Tatmadaw increased as unrest swept the country following the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état. On 27 March 2021, KNU Brigade 5 overran a Myanmar Army base near the Thai border, killing ten soldiers including a deputy battalion commander. The Myanmar army launched multiple airstrikes on Karen villages in retaliation. In 2021, KNU became a member of the National Unity Consultative Council.

Following the coup, the KNU launched an investigation on Nerdah Bo Mya, a commander of the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO), the KNU&#x27;s other main armed wing, for his role in the extrajudicial execution of 25 men. He refused to cooperate with the investigation and instead formed a splinter group, the Kawthoolei Army. The Kawthoolei Army has since banded with two resistance units, the Venom Commando and the Lion Battalion, both of which had previously been supervised by the KNLA&#x27;s Brigade 6.

==Conditions of ceasefire==
The group announced it will never enter into ceasefire talks with the military unless three conditions are met:
# The military must agree to leave politics completely.
# The military must face justice during the transition period – junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing should not get immunity for the offenses they committed.
# The military must accept a new constitution that is suitable for the establishment of a federal democratic union.

==Leadership==
The Karen National Union leadership is a democratically elected body with individuals elected at a four-yearly congress. The KNU Congress is recognised as the KNU&#x27;s supreme legislative body and it is here that the President, vice-president, General Secretary, Joint Secretaries 1 and 2 and the Central Executive Committee (CEC), the Central Standing Committees (CSC) and candidate members are elected. The seven KNU districts are responsible for electing their own District Chairmen and District Standing Committee leaders every two years. As the District Chairmen and Brigade Commanders are elected at local levels, they are automatically appointed as Central Standing Committee Members. The District Chairmen and Brigade Commanders together with nominated District Standing Committee Members attend the KNU congresses. In addition, elected Central Standing Committee members would provide the ministers for 14 Departments including Culture, Defence, Education, Forestry, Foreign Affairs, Health, and Mining. The CEC comprises eleven members responsible for the day-to-day running of the KNU. The CSC meets annually when issues arise that directly affect the KNU policies and/or the existence of the KNU organisation, the CEC will call a CSC Emergency Meeting.

Additionally, the Foreign Affairs Department appoints KNU representatives. These representatives are based among the Karen communities who support KNU&#x27;s political goals and objectives in their respective countries.

The incumbent leaders elected at the 15th KNU Congress are:

<text>CIF (&quot;Common Intermediate Format&quot; or &quot;Common Interchange Format&quot;), also known as FCIF (&quot;Full Common Intermediate Format&quot;), is a standardized format for the picture resolution, frame rate, color space, and color subsampling of digital video sequences used in video teleconferencing systems. It was first defined in the H.261 standard in 1988.

As the word &quot;common&quot; in its name implies, CIF was designed as a common compromise format to be relatively easy to convert for use either with PAL or NTSC standard displays and cameras. CIF defines a video sequence with a resolution of 352 × 288, which has a simple relationship to the PAL picture size, but with a frame rate of 30000/1001 (roughly 29.97) frames per second like NTSC, with color encoded using a YCbCr representation with 4:2:0 color sampling. It was designed as a compromise between PAL and NTSC schemes, since it uses a picture size that corresponds most easily to PAL, but uses the frame rate of NTSC. The compromise was established as a way to reach international agreement so that video conferencing systems in different countries could communicate with each other without needing two separate modes for displaying the received video.

==Technical details==
The simple way to convert NTSC video to CIF is to capture every other field (e.g., the top fields) of interlaced video, downsample it by 2:1 horizontally to convert 704 samples per line to 352 samples per line, and upsample it vertically by a ratio of 6:5 vertically to convert 240 lines to 288 lines. The simple way to convert PAL video to CIF is to similarly capture every other field, downsample it horizontally by 2:1, and introduce some jitter in the frame rate by skipping or repeating frames as necessary. Since H.261 systems typically operated at low bit rates, they also typically operated at low frame rates by skipping many of the camera source frames, so introducing some jitter in the frame rate tended not to be noticeable. More sophisticated conversion schemes (e.g., using deinterlacing to improve the vertical resolution from an NTSC camera) could also be used in higher quality systems.

In contrast to the CIF compromise that originated with the H.261 standard, there are two variants of the SIF (&quot;Source Input Format&quot;) that was first defined in the MPEG-1 standard. SIF is otherwise very similar to CIF. SIF on 525-line (&quot;NTSC&quot;) based systems is 352 × 240 with a frame rate of 30000/1001 frames per second, and on 625-line (&quot;PAL&quot;) based systems, it has the same picture size as CIF (352 × 288) but with a frame rate of 25 frames per second.

Some references to CIF are intended to refer only to its &quot;resolution&quot; (352 × 288), without intending to refer to its frame rate.

The YCbCr color representation had been previously defined in the first standard digital video source format, CCIR 601, in 1982. However, CCIR 601 uses 4:2:2 color sampling, which subsamples the Cb and Cr components only horizontally. H.261 additionally used vertical color subsampling, resulting in what is known as 4:2:0.

QCIF means &quot;Quarter CIF&quot;. To have one quarter of the area, as &quot;quarter&quot; implies, the height and width of the frame are halved.

Terms also used are SQCIF (Sub Quarter CIF, sometimes Sub-QCIF), 4CIF (4 × CIF), 9CIF (9 × CIF) and 16CIF (16 × CIF). The resolutions for all of these formats are summarized in the table below.

xCIF pixels are not square, instead having a ″native″ aspect ratio (pixel aspect ratio (PAR)) of 12:11 (PAR = DAR : SAR =  :  = ), as with the standard for 625-line systems (see CCIR 601). On square-pixel displays (e.g., computer screens and many modern televisions) xCIF rasters should be rescaled so that the picture covers a 4:3 area, in order to avoid a &quot;stretched&quot; look: CIF content expanded horizontally by 12:11 results in a 4:3 raster of 384 × 288 square pixels (384 = 352 * 12/11). (This can happen on larger graphics displays of any aspect ratio in a window of square pixels or enlarged to full screen on any larger 4:3 graphic display.)

The CIF and QCIF picture dimensions were specifically chosen to be multiples of 16 because of the way that discrete cosine transform based video compression/decompression was handled in H.261, using 16 × 16 macroblocks and 8 × 8 transform blocks. So a CIF-size image (352 × 288) contains 22 × 18 macroblocks and a QCIF image (176 × 144) contains 11 × 9 macroblocks. The 16 × 16 macroblock concept was later also used in other compression standards such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2, H.263, and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.

<text>For the Norwegian hip hop trio, see &quot;Warlocks&quot;
The Warlocks are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1998 by the guitarist/singer Bobby Hecksher. The band&#x27;s music has ranged from psychedelic rock to drone music. There have been many changes in personnel since its formation, with Hecksher the only constant member.

==History==
=== Formation and signing to Bomp! ===
The band was founded in 1998 in Los Angeles by Bobby Hecksher, adopting a name used by both the Velvet Underground and the Grateful Dead in their early days. At the age of fifteen, Hecksher moved to Los Angeles from Florida with his family. Hecksher&#x27;s first instrument was cello, eventually moving on to bass guitar. Hecksher&#x27;s grandfather owned a radio station.

In the years before the formation of the band, Hecksher was busy with a number of other projects in Los Angeles, including Charles Brown Superstar, Don Knotts Overdrive (Hecksher left DKO in 1995 and the band eventually changed its name to Head Set due to legal threats from the actual Don Knotts), and Magic Pacer, played bass guitar with Beck on the &quot;Stereopathic Soulmanure&quot; album and also with The Brian Jonestown Massacre for a brief period.

The Warlocks played their first gig on July 4, 1998. Receiving comparisons with &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;-era Velvet Underground and Spacemen 3, the band signed a two-album deal with the renowned indie label Bomp! in October 2000. Supposedly signed in Hecksher&#x27;s blood, the contract with Bomp! yielded the band&#x27;s first release in 2000, the mini-album &quot;The Warlocks&quot;. This was followed by the release of its first full-length record, &quot;Rise and Fall&quot;, in 2001. &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; received a four-and-a-half-star review from &quot;AllMusic&quot;, with Bryan Thomas describing it as a &quot;solid effort&quot;. Hecksher worked as a games tester for DreamWorks until at least 2001.

=== Birdman and Mute contracts ===
After the release of &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; the band left Bomp! and signed with Birdman Records. The EP &quot;Phoenix&quot; was released by Birdman in 2002 and was followed by a full-length album also called &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which was also released in 2002, to positive acclaim. &quot;Phoenix&quot; included a collaboration with Peter Kember (Sonic Boom), of Spacemen 3 and Spectrum, on the song &quot;Hurricane Heart Attack&quot;. &quot;Shake the Dope Out&quot; and &quot;Baby Blue&quot; were also released as singles. The group toured the US and overseas with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Raveonettes and Interpol.

Following &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the Warlocks signed to Mute and released &quot;Surgery&quot; in 2005, produced by Tom Rothrock. The record represents a departure from their earlier psychedelic sound into dreamier pop territory, while retaining the band&#x27;s hard-edged brand of rock. The songs on this record are shorter and more structured than some of their previous work. &quot;Come Save Us&quot; was released as a single. &quot;Surgery&quot; received a mixed reception from critics; A PopMatters review by Stephen Haag rated it at 6 out of 10, while a Pitchfork review gave the album only a 1.7 out of 10 rating, with Nick Sylvester describing the album as &quot;A mopey bunch of trite sap O.D.-type tales almost as unstomachable as the band&#x27;s former crapothecary hymns.&quot; Prefix gave the album 8.0 out of 10, describing it as &quot;far more approachable&quot; than their earlier releases. The album&#x27;s lack of commercial success led to the end of their deal with Mute.

=== Later releases ===
In the years after &quot;Surgery&quot;, the band toured internationally and sustained changes to the lineup, leading up to the 2007 release of &quot;Heavy Deavy Skull Lover&quot; on Tee Pee. The album was, according to Hecksher, recorded over a single weekend, with the band members quitting afterwards. The album is considered darker than their previous work, with the band exploring a more experimental direction. A review in &quot;Spin&quot; described the album as &quot;funereal&quot; and &quot;sluggishly unrealised&quot;, while AllMusic called it &quot;uneven&quot;. &quot;Heavy Deavy Skull Lover&quot; was recorded as a four-piece and marks a brief hiatus from the band for founding member John Christian Rees, who later returned before work began on their 2009 album, &quot;The Mirror Explodes&quot;. &quot;The Mirror Explodes&quot; was released in 2009 by Tee Pee. Production of the record was assisted by Joey Santiago of the Pixies.

The years following &quot;The Mirror Explodes&quot; saw two online releases by the band, available through Bandcamp, as well as a reissue of &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; via Zap Banana/Cargo in October 2010 which included previously unreleased rarities and artwork by Darren Grealish. The first of the online releases, the highly experimental &quot;EXP&quot;, was released on January 1, 2010. The second, &quot;Enter At Your Own Skull: Unreleased Volume One&quot;, a compilation of B-sides, demos and outtakes, was released on June 9, 2011. Besides the online releases and &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; reissue, the years after &quot;The Mirror Explodes&quot; were filled with intermittent touring and more line-up changes, resulting in the band solidifying as a five-piece.

The band provided another commercial release in 2013 with &quot;Skull Worship&quot;, also via Zap Banana/Cargo (distribution). &quot;Skull Worship&quot; was released on November 26, 2013.

The Warlocks&#x27; seventh studio album, &quot;Songs from the Pale Eclipse&quot;, was released on September 2. A single, &quot;Lonesome Bulldog&quot;, was released in promotion for the album in June 2016.

The Warlocks&#x27; eighth studio album, &quot;Mean Machine Music&quot;, was released on May 31, 2019.

The Warlocks&#x27; ninth studio album, &quot;The Chain&quot;, was released on April 3, 2020.

The Warlocks&#x27; tenth studio album, &quot;In Between Sad&quot; was released on September 22, 2023.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s music has been described as psychedelic rock. In 2008, Hecksher said of the band&#x27;s sound &quot;...even though it&#x27;s seemingly chaotic, achieving our sound is a really specific process. We need all these big, hollow-bodied guitars going through old Fender amps with reverb, or it won’t work.&quot;

In 2007, the bass guitarist Jenny Fraser described the songwriting process: &quot;Hecksher writes the skeleton of the songs and everyone writes their own parts. He always draws the picture and we paint it in.&quot;

Hecksher acknowledges influences including The Velvet Underground, Spacemen 3, Spiritualized and The Jesus and Mary Chain.

<doc id="504356" wikidata="Q5384204" url="?curid=504356" title="Equality feminism">
<text>Equality feminism is a subset of the overall feminism movement and more specifically of the liberal feminist tradition that focuses on the basic similarities between men and women, and whose ultimate goal is the equality of both genders in all domains. This includes economic and political equality, equal access within the workplace, freedom from oppressive gender stereotyping, and an androgynous worldview.

Feminist theory seeks to promote the legal status of women as equal and undifferentiated from that of men. While equality feminists largely agree that men and women have basic biological differences in anatomy and frame, they argue that on a psychological level, the capability of using of rationality or reason is equal between men and women. For equality feminists, men and women are equal in terms of their ability to reason, achieve goals, and prosper in both the work and home front.

Equality feminism was the dominant version of feminism following Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792). Wollstonecraft made the case that women&#x27;s equality to men manifests itself in education and worker&#x27;s rights and further produced a proverbial roadmap in order for future women to follow in terms of activism and feminist theorizing. Since then, active equality feminists have included Simone de Beauvoir, the Seneca Falls Convention Leaders, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Coffin Mott, Susan B. Anthony, Betty Friedan, and Gloria Steinem.

While equality feminism was the dominant perspective of feminism during the 19th and 20th century, the 1980s and 1990s brought about a new focus in popular feminism on difference feminism, or the essential differences between men and women. In opposition to equality feminism, this view advocates for the celebration of the &quot;feminine&quot; by focusing on traditionally viewed female traits, such as empathy, nurturing, and care. While equality feminists view human nature as essentially androgynous, difference feminists claim that this viewpoint aligns the &quot;good&quot; with male-dominated stereotypes, thus operating within the patriarchal framework of society.

== History ==

In both law and in theology, women were portrayed as both physically and intellectually inferior. One of the first feminist documents that set the stage for feministic movements occurred when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; in 1792. While this literature was seen as rebellious at the time, it echoed the feelings of women throughout France as women&#x27;s republican clubs demanded that liberty, equality, and fraternity should be applied to both genders. While this movement gained notoriety, it was eventually extinguished by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s Code Napoleon that established that the husband had complete control over the family.

While much of the equality feminism movements that occurred in France were not successful, they influenced much of the movements that occurred in North America in the 1800s. Both Abigail Adams and Mercy Otis Warren fought for woman&#x27;s emancipation to be included in the constitution of 1776, to no avail. However, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Coffin Mott, along with thousands of other women, forever changed the dynamics of equality feminism with the women&#x27;s convention at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. Here, along with independence, they demanded full legal equality in all aspects of life (education, commercial opportunities, compensation, voting rights, etc.). With the influence of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, this movement expanded into Europe. In 1869, John Stuart Mill published &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;, in which he argued that equality between the sexes would translate to more moral and intellectual advancement, which in turn would result in more human happiness for everyone.

After its expansion into Europe, the movement&#x27;s growth slowed until 1920, when the woman suffrage movement occurred; many women were divided on the issue of whether or not women were on equal standing with men. This continued until the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women was established in 1946 to secure equal political, economic, and educational opportunities for women throughout the world. In 1949, French existentialist Simone de Beauvoir published the work &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, in which she debunks many of the claims made regarding women and the fight for gender equality. In 1963, another literature pertaining to equality feminism arose, Betty Friedan&#x27;s &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, in which she discussed &quot;the problem that has no name,&quot; referring to the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s. She uses this information to describe many of the gender inequalities that society has created that have resulted in this unhappiness, citing the personal example of giving up her psychology career to tend to her children. Using these literatures as a guide, feminism once again arose in the United States with the development of the National Organization for Women (NOW) formed in 1966. This organization fought for the removal of all legal and social barriers placed upon women to once again influence true equality between men and women. In 1972, women leaders such as Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan, and Gloria Steinem pushed the Equal Rights Amendment through Congress; however, it fell short of ratification by 1982.

== Equality feminist theory ==

Equality feminist theory is the extension of the equality of the male and female into theoretical and philosophical fields of thought. At its core, equality feminist theory advocates for the equal standing of both men and women in terms of desires, wants, goals, and achievement. Thus, from this viewpoint, the basis of human nature outside of culture is androgynous, neutral, and equal.

Much of equality feminism focuses on the relation of reason as the central tenet of both men and women equally. Mary Wollstonecraft in &quot;A Vindication on the Rights of Women&quot; (1792) claimed that women should enjoy the same legal and political rights as men on the grounds that they are human beings. Specifically, Wollstonecraft argues for &quot;[a]sserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for&quot;. In this way, both men and women should have equal access to rights because they have an equal access to the capacity to reason. Similarly, &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot; (1869), John Stuart Mill advocated that society ought to be arranged according to reason and that &#x27;accidents of birth&#x27; is irrelevant. Thus, because both men and women are governed by principles of reason, then the biological elements such as sex, gender, and race are not contributing factors to the essence of the individual. Mill notes that within a patriarchal society, &quot;Men hold women in subjection by representing to them meekness, submissiveness resignation of all individual will into the hands of a man as an essential part of sexual attractiveness&quot;. In this way, to say that women have essential characteristics of submission by nature of their sex is an oppressive measure that contradicts the basic principle of reason that governs all human nature.

== Important figures ==

===Mary Wollstonecraft===
In 1792 Wollstonecraft wrote one of the earliest works in feminist philosophy and though she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal she does call for equality in various realms of life which set the stage for future equality feminist works. In her piece &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects&quot;, Wollstonecraft argues that women should have an education comparable to their position in society. She articulates her argument by claiming that since women were the primary care givers they could be able to better educate their own children and be seen as &quot;companions&quot; to the husband rather than wives if they were given this opportunity. Instead of being considered &quot;property&quot; that were exchanged through marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that women are human beings and therefore deserve equal fundamental rights as men.

===John Stuart Mill===
In 1869, John Stuart Mill with the help of his wife Harriet Taylor Mill published &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;, in it he argued for equality between the sexes. John Stuart Mill was able to draw off of some of the arguments his wife made in her essay &quot;The Enfranchisement of Women&quot;, in which she opened the door of favoring equality for both men and women. Mill believe that the moral and intellectual advancement from giving women the opportunity to be considered equal would translate to greater happiness for everyone involved. He believed that all humans had the capability of being educated and civilized, with which he argued women should be given the right to vote. Throughout the book Mill continues to argue that both men and women should be able to vote to defend their rights and be able to have the opportunity to stand on their own two feet morally and intellectually, and constantly used his position in Parliament to advocate for women&#x27;s suffrage.

Mill attacks many of the arguments that women are inferior at certain activities and therefore be forbidden from doing them by saying that women are not given the opportunities and therefore we do not know what women are capable of. He claims that males are making an authoritative statement without evidence, an argument solely based on speculation. Mill claims that by giving women this opportunity to figure out exactly what they were capable of would double the mass of mental faculties to serve humanity, and could produce a great impact on human development.

===Simone de Beauvoir===
Simone de Beauvoir played a large role in equality feminism with the publishing of her book &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, broken into three parts. In the first part, &quot;Destiny&quot;, de Beauvoir discusses the relationship of male to female in a variety of creatures before comparing human beings. This physiological data along with psychoanalytical data help her come to the conclusion that there was not a historical defeat of the female sex. Part two, &quot;History&quot;, outlines the two factors in the evolution of women&#x27;s condition: participation in production and freedom from reproductive slavery. In these chapters, de Beauvoir compares being a woman to being like an animal, similar to the way male animals dominated a female. Finally in part three, &quot;Myths&quot;, de Beauvoir discusses the perceived &quot;everlasting disappointment&quot; of women from a male heterosexual point of view. She then comes back and discusses full reality of the situation to show the discrepancies between perception and reality. Throughout her literary career, de Beauvoir helped unravel some of the &quot;myths&quot; associated with perceptions in gender and set forth a strong message that men and women should be treated equal with equal rights.

===Betty Friedan===
Betty Friedan became one of the most recognized equality feminists after writing the book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, in which she discusses &quot;the problem that has no name&quot;, female unhappiness in the 1950s and 1960s. It was through this book that Friedman was able to address many of the problems and the widespread recognition allowed her to later become president of the National Organization for Women (NOW).

Throughout the piece Friedan addressed the problem that women had &quot;wanting more than a husband, children, and a home&quot;. Friedan discusses the societal expectations of raising children and how this caused many women to not be able to do what they wanted. Many decisions that were made for women were made by men and this had worn out many women. She discusses the problem of education and that many families solely focused on education for the male children and women were instead &quot;assigned to be married to fulfill child-bearing expectations&quot;. It was through the impact of this piece of literature that women were finally given a voice to say it was okay to not want to conform to societal expectations and fight for equality of opportunities, choices, marriage, education, and voting.

== Objections ==

The main objection raised to equality feminism comes in the form of difference feminism, the belief that emphasizes the differences between men and women. This viewpoint, as championed by such feminists such as Carol Gilligan, Joan Tronto, Eva Feder Kittay, Genevieve Lloyd, Alison Jaggar, and Ynestra King, developed out of the rejection of the androgynous view of human nature as emphasized in equality feminism. Begun largely in the 1980s, this viewpoint makes the case that equality feminism fails to account for the uniquely female experience, and thus creates the male perspective as the dominant aspiration.

<doc id="504357" wikidata="Q1136996" url="?curid=504357" title="User-centered design">
<text>User-centered design (UCD) or user-driven development (UDD) is a framework of processes in which usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks and workflow of a product, service or brand are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. This attention includes testing which is conducted during each stage of design and development from the envisioned requirements, through pre-production models to post production.

Testing is beneficial as it is often difficult for the designers of a product to understand the experiences of first-time users and each user&#x27;s learning curve. UCD is based on the understanding of a user, their demands, priorities and experiences, and can lead to increased product usefulness and usability. UCD applies cognitive science principles to create intuitive, efficient products by understanding users&#x27; mental processes, behaviors, and needs.

UCD differs from other product design philosophies in that it tries to optimize the product around how users engage with the product, in order that users are not forced to change their behavior and expectations to accommodate the product. The users are at the focus, followed by the product&#x27;s context, objectives and operating environment, and then the granular details of task development, organization, and flow.

== History ==
The term &quot;user-centered design&quot; (UCD) was coined by Rob Kling in 1977 and later adopted in Donald A. Norman&#x27;s research laboratory at the University of California, San Diego. The concept became popular as a result of Norman&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;User-Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction&quot; and the concept gained further attention and acceptance in Norman&#x27;s 1988 book &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;, in which Norman describes the psychology behind what he deems &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; design through examples. He exalts the importance of design in our everyday lives and the consequences of errors caused by bad designs.

Norman describes principles for building well-designed products. His recommendations are based on the user&#x27;s needs, leaving aside what he considers secondary issues like aesthetics. The main highlights of these are:

* Simplifying the structure of the tasks such that the possible actions at any moment are intuitive.
* Making things visible, including the conceptual model of the system, actions, results of actions and feedback.
* Achieving correct mappings between intended results and required actions.
* Embracing and exploiting the constraints of systems.

In a later book, &quot;Emotional Design&quot;, Norman returns to some of his earlier ideas to elaborate what he had come to find as overly reductive.

== Models and approaches ==

The UCD process considers user requirements from the beginning and throughout the product cycle. Requirements are noted and refined through investigative methods including: ethnographic study, contextual inquiry, prototype testing, usability testing and other methods. Generative methods may also be used including: card sorting, affinity diagramming and participatory design sessions. In addition, user requirements can be inferred by careful analysis of usable products similar to the product being designed.

UCD takes inspiration from the following models:
* Cooperative design ( co-design) which involves designers and users on an equal footing. This is the Scandinavian tradition of design of IT artifacts and it has been evolving since 1970.
* Participatory design (PD), a North American model inspired by cooperative design, with focus on the participation of users. Since 1990, bi-annual conferences have been held.
* Contextual design (CD, a.k.a. customer-centered design) involves gathering data from actual customers in real-world situations and applying findings to the final design.

The following principles help in ensuring a design is user-centered:
* Design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.
* Users are involved throughout design and development.
* Design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.
* Process is iterative (see below).
* Design addresses the whole user experience.
* Design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.

== User-centered design process ==
The goal of UCD is to make products with a high degree of usability (i.e., convenience of use, manageability, effectiveness, and meeting the user&#x27;s requirements). The general phases of the UCD process are:
# Specify context of use: Identify the primary users of the product and their reasons, requirements and environment for product use.
# Specify requirements: Identified the detailed technical requirements of the product. This can aid designers in planning development and setting goals.
# Create design solutions and development: Based on product goals and requirements, create an iterative cycle of product testing and refinement.
# Evaluate product: Perform usability testing and collect user feedback at every design stage.
The above procedure is repeated to further refine the product. These phases are general approaches and factors such as design goals, team and their timeline, and environment in which the product is developed, determine the appropriate phases for a project and their order. Practical models include the waterfall model, agile model or any other software engineering practice.

== Analysis tools ==
There are a number of tools that are used in the analysis of UCD, mainly: personas, scenarios, and essential use cases.

=== Persona ===
During the UCD process, the design team may create a persona, an archetype representing a product user which helps guide decisions about product features, navigation, interactions, and aesthetics. In most cases, personas are synthesized from a series of ethnographic interviews with real people, then captured in one- or two-page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and environment, and possibly fictional personal details to give it more character.

<doc id="504363" wikidata="Q4769652" url="?curid=504363" title="Annual dry season offensive">
<text>Annual dry season offensive is a type of low intensity warfare typically practiced by national governments against ethnic insurgent groups fighting for independence or autonomy. This type of warfare usually occurs in countries with poor transportation infrastructure and a climate that makes fighting battles or even holding territory during parts of the year very difficult.

The governments of Myanmar and Sudan have engaged in annual dry season offensives in the 21st century. Cambodia and Vietnam have engaged in such offensives during their war against Cambodian insurgent groups in the past. North Vietnam historically engaged in such offensives during a proxy war between irregular groups in Laos during the Vietnam War.

== Mechanism ==
Such an offensive is carried out by focusing troop movement and supply to the dry season. Government forces usually move out of well-established base areas into insurgent territory where they attempt to take and hold as much territory as possible while inflicting as many casualties as possible on the insurgent army. The army will also typically inflict as much material damage as possible in areas supporting the insurgency. The offensive also typically extends to collective punishments of the civilian population of the country. At the end of the offensive, the army gives back all of the territory taken and returns to its base areas until the next dry season. 

The strategy behind annual dry season offensives is to slowly wear down an insurgency or to at least contain it. It can also prevent insurgent groups from gaining de facto independence from the government. The strategy has never on its own defeated an insurgent movement, but it can pressure insurgent groups into political negotiations. It is often used against groups that demand independence from a government and have a large base of local ethnic support.

<doc id="504367" wikidata="Q1074585" url="?curid=504367" title="Chipko movement">
<text>The Chipko movement () is a forest conservation movement in India. Opposed to commercial logging and the government&#x27;s policies on deforestation, protesters in the 1970s engaged in tree hugging, wrapping their arms around trees so that they could not be felled.

Today, beyond its eco-socialist reputation, the movement is seen increasingly as an ecofeminist one. Although many of its leaders were men, women had a much more significant participation, as they were the ones most affected by the rampant deforestation, which led to a lack of firewood and fodder as well as water for drinking and irrigation. Over the years they also became primary stakeholders in a majority of the afforestation work that happened under the Chipko movement. In 1987, the Chipko movement was awarded the Right Livelihood Award &quot;for its dedication to the conservation, restoration and ecologically-sound use of India&#x27;s natural resources&quot;.

== Background ==
Inspired by Karan Singh and the Jyoti Kumari movement, in the year 1964 &quot;Dasholi Gram Swarajya Sangh&quot; (&quot;Dasholi Society for Village Self-Rule&quot;), was set up by Gandhian social worker Chandi Prasad Bhatt in Chamoli Gopeshwar, with an aim to set up small industries using the resources of the forest. Their first project was a small workshop making farm tools for local use. Its name was later changed to DGSM from the original &quot;Dashauli Gram Swarajya Sangh&quot; (DGSS) in the 1980s. Here they had to face restrictive forest policies, a hangover of colonial era still prevalent, as well as the &quot;contractor system&quot;, in which these pieces of forest land were commodified and auctioned to big contractors, usually from the plains, who brought along their own skilled and semi-skilled laborers, leaving only the menial jobs like hauling rocks for the hill people, and paying them next to nothing. On the other hand, the hill regions saw an influx of more people from the outside, which only added to the already strained ecological balance.

Hastened by increasing hardships, the Garhwal Himalayas soon became the centre for a rising ecological awareness of how reckless deforestation had denuded much of the forest cover, resulting in the devastating Alaknanda River floods of July 1970, when a major landslide blocked the river and affected an area starting from Hanumanchatti, near Badrinath to 320 kilometers (200 miles) downstream till Haridwar, further numerous villages, bridges and roads were washed away. Thereafter, incidents of landslides and land subsidence became common in an area which was experiencing a rapid increase in civil engineering projects.

==Event==
Villagers including women began to organise themselves under several smaller groups. It was started in 1973, taking up local causes with the authorities, and stand up against commercial logging operations that threatened their livelihoods. In October 1971, the Sangha workers held a demonstration in Gopeshwar to protest against the policies of the Forest Department. More rallies and marches were held in late 1972, but to little effect, until a decision to take shaurya direct action was taken. The first such occasion occurred when the Forest Department turned down the Sangh&#x27;s annual request for ten ash trees for its farm tools workshop, and instead awarded a contract for 300 trees to Simon Company, a sporting goods manufacturer in distant Allahabad, to make tennis racquets. In March 1973, the lumbermen arrived at Gopeshwar, and after a couple of weeks, they were confronted at village Mandal on 24 April 1973, where about a hundred villagers and DGSS workers were beating drums and shouting slogans, thus forcing the contractors and their lumbermen to retreat.

This was the first confrontation of the movement, The contract was eventually cancelled and awarded to the Sangh instead. By now, the issue had grown beyond the mere procurement of an annual quota of the ash trees and encompassed a growing concern over commercial logging and the government&#x27;s forest policy, which the villagers saw as unfavourable towards them. The Sangh also decided to resort to tree-hugging, or Chipko, as a means of non-violent protest.
But the struggle was far from over, as the same company was awarded more ash trees, in the Phata forest, 80 km (50 miles) away from Gopeshwar. Here again, due to local opposition, starting on 20 June 1974, the contractors retreated after a stand-off that lasted a few days. Thereafter, the villagers of Phata and Tarsali formed a vigil group and watched over the trees until December, when they had another successful stand-off when the activists reached the site in time. The lumbermen retreated leaving behind the five ash trees that felled.

A few months later, the final flashpoint began when the government announced an auction scheduled in January 1974, for 2,500 trees near Reni village, overlooking the Alaknanda River. Bhatt set out for the villages in the Reni area and incited the villagers, who decided to protest against the actions of the government by hugging the trees. Over the next few weeks, rallies and meetings continued in the Reni area.

On 25 March 1974, the day the lumbermen were to cut the trees, the men of Reni village and DGSS workers were in Chamoli, diverted by the state government and contractors to a fictional compensation payment site, while back home labourers arrived by the truckload to start logging operations. A local girl rushed to inform Gaura Devi, the head of the village &quot;Mahila Mangal Dal&quot;, at Reni village (Laata was her ancestral home and Reni adopted home). Gaura Devi led 27 of the village women to the site and confronted the loggers. When all talking failed, and the loggers started to shout and abuse the women, threatening them with guns, the women resorted to hugging the trees to stop them from being felled. The women kept an all-night vigil guarding their trees against the cutters until a few of them relented and left the village. The next day, when the men and leaders returned, the news of the movement spread to the neighbouring Laata and other villages including Henwalghati, and more people joined in. Eventually, after a four-day stand-off, the contractors left.

==Effect==
The news soon reached the state capital, where the state Chief Minister, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna, set up a committee to look into the matter, which eventually ruled in favour of the villagers. This became a turning point in the history of eco-development struggles in the region and around the world.

The struggle soon spread across many parts of the region, and such spontaneous stand-offs between the local community and timber merchants occurred at several locations, with hill women demonstrating their new-found power as non-violent activists. As the movement gathered shape under its leaders, the name Chipko movement was attached to their activities. According to Chipko historians, the term originally used by Bhatt was the word &quot;angalwaltha&quot; in the Garhwali language for &quot;embrace&quot;, which later was adapted to the Hindi word, &quot;Chipko&quot;, which means to stick.

Over the next five years, the movement spread to many districts in the region, and within a decade throughout the Uttarakhand Himalayas. Larger issues of ecological and economic exploitation of the region were raised. The villagers demanded that no forest-exploiting contracts should be given to outsiders and local communities should have effective control over natural resources like land, water, and forests. They wanted the government to provide low-cost materials to small industries and ensure development of the region without disturbing the ecological balance. The movement took up economic issues of landless forest workers and asked for guarantees of minimum wage. Globally Chipko demonstrated how environment causes, up until then considered an activity of the rich, were a matter of life and death for the poor, who were all too often the first ones to be devastated by an environmental tragedy. Several scholarly studies were made in the aftermath of the movement. In 1977, in another area, women tied sacred threads, called Rakhi, around trees destined for felling. According to the Hindu tradition of Raksha Bandhan, the Rakhi signifies a bond between brother and sisters. They declared that the trees would be saved even if it cost them their lives.

Women&#x27;s participation in the Chipko agitation was a very novel aspect of the movement. The forest contractors of the region usually doubled up as suppliers of alcohol to men. Women held sustained agitations against the habit of alcoholism and broadened the agenda of the movement to cover other social issues. The movement achieved a victory when the government issued a ban on felling of trees in the Himalayan regions for fifteen years in 1980 by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, until the green cover was fully restored. One of the prominent Chipko leaders, Gandhian Sunderlal Bahuguna, took a 5,000 kilometre (3000 mile) trans-Himalaya foot march in 1981–83, spreading the Chipko message to a far greater area. Gradually, women set up cooperatives to guard local forests, and also organized fodder production at rates conducive to local environment. Next, they joined in land rotation schemes for fodder collection, helped replant degraded land, and established and ran nurseries stocked with species they selected.

==Participants==

One of Chipko&#x27;s most salient features was the mass participation of female villagers. As the backbone of Uttarakhand&#x27;s Agrarian economy, women were most directly affected by environmental degradation and deforestation, and thus related to the issues most easily. How much this participation impacted or derived from the ideology of Chipko has been fiercely debated in academic circles.

Despite this, both female and male activists did play pivotal roles in the movement including Gaura Devi, Sudesha Devi, Bachni Devi, Chandi Prasad Bhatt, Sundarlal Bahuguna, Govind Singh Rawat, Dhoom Singh Negi, Shamsher Singh Bisht and Ghanasyam Raturi, the Chipko poet, whose songs are still popular in the Himalayan region. Chandi Prasad Bhatt was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1982, and Sunderlal Bahuguna was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 2009.

== Legacy ==
In Tehri District, Chipko activists would go on to protest limestone mining in the Doon Valley in the 1980s, as the movement spread through the Dehradun district, which had earlier seen deforestation of its forest cover leading to heavy loss of flora and fauna. Finally quarrying was banned after years of agitation by Chipko activists, followed by a vast public drive for afforestation, which turned around the valley, just in time. Also in the 1980s, activists like Bahuguna protested against construction of the Tehri dam on the Bhagirathi River, which went on for the next two decades, before founding the &quot;Beej Bachao Andolan&quot;, the Save the Seeds movement, that continues to the present day.

Over time, as a United Nations Environment Programme report mentioned, Chipko activists started &quot;working a socio-economic revolution by winning control of their forest resources from the hands of a distant bureaucracy which is only concerned with the selling of forestland for making urban-oriented products&quot;. The Chipko movement became a benchmark for socio-ecological movements in other forest areas of Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar; in September 1983, Chipko inspired a similar, Appiko movement in Karnataka state of India, where tree felling in the Western Ghats and Vindhyas was stopped. In Kumaon region, Chipko took on a more radical tone, combining with the general movement for a separate Uttarakhand state, which was eventually achieved in 2001.

In recent years, the movement not only inspired numerous people to work on practical programmes of water management, energy conservation, afforestation, and recycling, but also encouraged scholars to start studying issues of environmental degradation and methods of conservation in the Himalayas and throughout India.

On 26 March 2004, Reni, Laata, and other villages of the Niti Valley celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Chipko movement, where all the surviving original participants united. The celebrations started at Laata, the ancestral home of Gaura Devi, where Pushpa Devi, wife of late Chipko Leader Govind Singh Rawat, Dhoom Singh Negi, Chipko leader of Henwalghati, Tehri Garhwal, and others were celebrated. From here a procession went to Reni, the neighbouring village, where the actual Chipko action took place on 26 March 1974. This marked the beginning of worldwide methods to improve the present situation. Recently, by following the legacy of the Chipko movement, in 2017 rapid deforestation over the century-old trees, forming almost a canopy in Jessore Road of the district of North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, has also sparked a huge movement in the form of the campaign of saving 4000 trees by the local masses.

On 26 March 2018, a Chipko movement conservation initiative was marked by a Google Doodle on its 45th anniversary.

<doc id="504371" wikidata="Q3042333" url="?curid=504371" title="Constitutional debate in Canada">
<text>The Constitutional debate of Canada is an ongoing debate covering various political issues regarding the fundamental law of the country. The debate can be traced back to the Royal Proclamation, issued on October 7, 1763, following the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1763) wherein France ceded most of New France to Great Britain in favour of keeping Guadeloupe.

Since the enactment of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, which brought the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia together as Canada, the debate has focused on these issues:

*The interpretation of the Constitution
*The division of powers between the federal and provincial governments
*The type of federalism to be applied within the federation
*The way the constitution should be amended
*The inclusion of specific civil rights in the constitution

== Historical overview ==
The initial policy of Great Britain with regards to its newly acquired colony of Quebec was revealed in a Royal Proclamation on October 7, 1763. The proclamation renamed Canada &quot;The Province of Quebec&quot;, redefined its borders, and established a British appointed colonial government. The new governor of the colony was given the power and direction to summon and call general assemblies of the people&#x27;s representatives.

== The status quo ==
The current Constitution of Canada consists of the 1867 &quot;British North America Act&quot; (BNA) and subsequent amendments.

=== Distribution of legislative powers ===
The BNA Act defined the areas of jurisdiction for the provinces and the federal government. There are 29 exclusive federal jurisdictions and 16 provincial jurisdictions. The provincial jurisdictions are listed under sections 92, 93 and 95 of the constitution.

The BNA Act granted the federal parliament all &quot;residuary&quot; powers not already defined as provincial. It also gave the federal government a veto power over provincial legislation. The members of the Senate of Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada, judges and the judges of all of the provinces&#x27; highest courts are appointed by the federal executive.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, did not change the divisions of responsibilities between the provincial and the federal legislatures, except for the provincial jurisdiction over natural resources and energy, which was clarified and slightly expanded.

=== Charter of rights and freedoms ===
The &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; was enshrined into the constitution of Canada in 1982. The charter covers fundamental liberties, democratic rights, mobility rights, legal rights, equality rights, language rights and minority language education rights.

=== Amendment process ===
The 1982 constitutional reform introduced an amendment process that no longer involved the approval of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The amendment formula is described in section 37 to 49 of the constitution. In general, amendments can be passed by the House of Commons, the Senate, and a two-thirds majority of the provincial legislatures (7 of the 10) representing at least 50% of the Canadian population (the 7/50 formula). Certain types of amendments use other amending formulas.

== Debated areas ==
=== Interpretation of the British North America Act ===
====Foundation of the nation====
In Canada West (Ontario), the confederation process was promoted as the act of foundation of a new British nation. The project generally received wide support in the press and in the political class. It is primarily the politicians of Canada West that, with the Great Coalition, orchestrated the process which led to the legislative union of the British North American colonies.

The anti-Confederation movement was however quite strong in one of the two Maritime provinces that were initially federated by the BNAA. The Liberal politicians of the Maritime provinces did not support the movement of the Great Coalition before or after the fact.

In Nova Scotia, 36 out of 38 seats of the provincial legislature and 18 out of 19 seats of the new federal legislature went to anti-Confederation candidates at the first election. Premier William Annand and federal MP Joseph Howe pushed for the removal of Nova Scotia from the new Dominion. Howe eventually accepted a position in the federal government of McDonald, while Annand kept fighting Confederation up until 1869.

The movement died shortly after when the idea of reversing the process of confederation was abandoned. The point of view that the confederation is the act of foundation of the Canadian nation was and still is today the policy of the federal government.

==== Pact between two founding peoples ====
In Canada East (Quebec), the confederation project was promoted by the and opposed by the . George-Étienne Cartier supported and promoted the project as a way to regain the political autonomy that Lower Canada had lost with the forced Union of 1840. Reluctant at first, the Catholic clergy eventually supported confederation when it became known that education and &quot;health&quot; were going to be exclusive provincial jurisdictions.

After 1867 and up until the 1960s, the idea that the BNAA was a legal document containing guarantees to the equality of the two founding peoples was taken for granted by most members of the intellectual elite of French Canada. Nationalist politicians from Quebec (sometimes Liberal, sometimes Conservative) were elected on programs which stated how they were to defend the constitutional guarantees granted by Great Britain to French Canadians in order to protect their nationality. Federal politicians, such as Henri Bourassa, advocated more autonomy for Canada within the British Empire, while provincial politicians such as Honoré Mercier defended the autonomy of the province of Quebec within the Canadian Dominion.

====Just another British Act====
The of Canada East opposed the confederation process, just as its ancestor party, the Parti patriote, had opposed the Union process. Some such as Antoine-Aimé Dorion, demanded that the project be submitted to a direct vote by the people, convinced it would be rejected. The process which led to the confederation was considered illegitimate because in their opinion it was undemocratic.

Other liberals suggested a highly decentralized confederation that would have given only certain limited powers to the union government. The party lead the anti-confederation campaign and at the first provincial elections, 13 out of 65 anti-confederation candidates were elected, obtaining 45% of the recorded votes.

Much later, in the late 1950s, the opinions of the would be supported by the first advocates of the independence of Quebec.

=== Nature of Canadian federalism ===
====Confederation / federation====
Since the creation of the federal state, the role of this new level of government has been the object of debate. As of 1867, some politicians have seen the federal government as the central, national government of Canada whereas others have seen it as a confederal government, the creation of the provinces, responsible for administering things the latter had in common.

====Symmetrical and asymmetrical federalism====
Symmetrical federalism refers to a political organization where all federated states have equal status and autonomy within the greater ensemble.

Asymmetrical federalism refers to a political organization where the federated states have variable levels of autonomy within the greater ensemble.

====Binationalism, bilingualism and biculturalism====
Mostly supported by French Canadians, the binational confederation was seen as a way for French Canadians and British Canadians to coexist within the same country and share common institutions. Since French Canadians viewed themselves as a distinct nation and wished for this nation to keep existing, many political leaders from Quebec promoted the official recognition of the French language by the federal government and all provincial governments. This view is today associated with the pre-Quiet Revolution era.

====Multicultural nation state====

Promoted by the Liberals during Pierre E. Trudeau&#x27;s prime ministership, this view of Canada is at once readily embraced by a great number of Canadians and is enshrined in Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is, however, seen as unacceptable because it is insufficient by essentially all Quebec provincial politicians. To them, the multicultural nation state model alone fails at recognizing the national character of Quebec society and the consequences of this for the Quebec state as a member state of the Canadian federation.

The concept of a pluralistic society is generally perceived positively in Quebec, which is also a land open to immigration. However, Quebec policies speak of civic &quot;interculturalism&quot; rather than multiculturalism, which is associated with ghettoization. The Canadian multiculturalism policy is often perceived negatively, for it depicts the French-speaking majority of Quebec as one of the many ethnic groups of Canada, therefore denying the national character of Quebec, and undermining the efforts of the Quebec state to integrate immigrants into its mainstream French-speaking society. Debates over issues of cultural pluralism such as reasonable accommodations for religious observance in public spaces have been prominent in Quebec politics and society in the 21st century, as in the Bouchard-Taylor Commission of 2007-08, the Quebec Charter of Values proposed in 2013 but abandoned in 2014, and the Act respecting the laicity of the State which became law in 2019.

====Multinational state====
Many politicians and public figures think that Canada would move forward in the recognition of its own diversity by declaring itself a multinational state. With regards to Quebec, this view would be more in line with the &quot;nation within the nation&quot; of former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in the pre-Trudeau era.

====One nation, one country====
Many Canadians outside Quebec think of Canada as a monolithic nation with 10 equal provinces. Since they see only one nation in the country, they are opposed to any kind of asymmetrical relation with Quebec or any other province. Believing that Canada needs a strong federal government to defend and promote national unity, some are by principle reluctant to decentralization of powers to the provinces. Others accept broad provincial powers so long as those given to Quebec are no different from those given to the other provinces (essentially the position of the Reform Party during the Meech Lake debate, as described in Preston Manning&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;The New Canada&quot;.

====Two nations, two countries====
With secession, many Quebec nationalists think they have the answer to Canada&#x27;s continual constitutional debate. Marginalized after the Patriotes rebellion of 1837–38, the secessionist option was resurrected as a credible solution in the wake of the 1960s Quiet Revolution of Quebec. Some politicians see independence as the normal conclusion of the Quebec struggle for the conservation of its autonomy within the Canadian federal framework. Some see it in a broader perspective of every people&#x27;s right to self-determination and what they see as the normal evolution of a 400-year-old former French colony that fell victim to the colonial wars between Great Britain and France.

====Treaty federalism====

The doctrine of treaty federalism states that Canada consists of two unions, one of ten provinces and the federal government, and the other of the Crown with the Aboriginal peoples of Canada. Under this doctrine, The First Nations, Inuit, and Métis are thought of as sovereign nations who are in a compact with Canada, rather than minority groups within the Canadian nation-state.

The report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996) stated that 

== Positions ==
=== Maintain status quo ===
The official position of the federal government of Canada, an overwhelming majority of Canadians outside Quebec and a minority of people (20%) inside Quebec. The Liberal Party of Canada is the main actor behind the efforts to maintain the constitutional status quo.

=== Constitutional reforms ===
Position of many federalists from English-speaking Canada and Quebec. Seen as the only way to avoid the secession of Quebec. Since the rise of the sovereignty movement, this option seems to gather a solid 40% of support among Quebec voters. Efforts to reform the Canadian constitution in order to recognize Quebec&#x27;s specificity (or distinct society) and provide a means to accommodate its need for greater autonomy have resulted in the Meech Lake Accord which collapsed before it came into effect and the Charlottetown Accord which was rejected by a majority of Canadians and also a majority of Quebecers in referendum in 1995. The option is still supported, with more or less energy, by the Liberal Party of Quebec.

=== Independence of Quebec ===
This is the position of the Quebec sovereigntists. Seen as the best or only way to ensure the normal development of the Quebec society from a cultural, economic and social point of view. Since the 1980s, this option seems to gather, from one survey to the next a solid 40% of support among Quebec voters. In 1980, the Quebec government held a referendum on sovereignty-association, which was rejected by 60% of the Quebec electorate, and a second one on sovereignty with an optional partnership, which was rejected by 50.6% of the same electorate. The option is presently supported by the and , both provincial parties in Quebec. Secession is not considered an option by federal-level parties other than the and essentially all the population of the English-speaking provinces.

<text>Dugommier () is a station of the Paris Métro on Line 6 in the 12th arrondissement.

==History==
The station opened on 1 March 1909 with the opening of the original section of Line 6 from Place d&#x27;Italie to Nation. It was initially named Charenton, due to its proximity to the Rue de Charenton, an artery which ran from Bastille to the suburban town of Charenton-le-Pont. On 12 July 1939, it was renamed after the nearby Rue Dugommier to avoid confusion: a station at Porte de Charenton had been added to the system in 1931, and another at Charenton-le-Pont would open in 1942. The street was named after Jacques François Dugommier (1738–1794), a general in the American and French Revolutionary wars. The station was located on the site of the &quot;Barrière de Charenton&quot;, a tollgate for the collection of taxation in the Wall of the Farmers-General, which was built in 1784-88 and demolished in 1860.

As part of RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du Métro&quot; programme, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated by 29 November 2002. In 2021, attendance is gradually rising, with 1,725,412 passengers entering this station, placing it in the 204th position of metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single access called &quot;Boulevard de Reuilly&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase decorated with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle and a Dervaux-type balustrade, leading to the right of no.1 of this boulevard.
===Station layout===

===Platforms===
Dugommier is a station of standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for most metro stations. The lighting strips are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls and tunnel exits. The vault is coated and painted white. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The seats are &quot;Motte&quot; style and green. The stairs leading to the platforms are tiled, as well as the perimeter of the platforms and the floor under the seats.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 71, 77, 87 and 215 of the RATP Bus Network.

==Nearby==
0.3 kilometers (330 yards) to the north is the Promenade Plantée—a long elevated linear park that follows an abandoned commuter railway trace (Ligne de Paris-Bastille à Marles-en-Brie) from the former Gare de la Bastille railway station to the Boulevard Périphérique. The railway&#x27;s Gare de Reuilly station remains at the east end of Rue Dugommier, repurposed for municipal offices. 160 meters to the west, the SNCF railway corridor separates the neighborhood from the redeveloped Bercy district along the Seine.

<text>Daumesnil () is a station on Line 6 and Line 8 of the Paris Métro in the 12th arrondissement.

==History==
The station opened on 1 March 1909 with the opening of the original section of Line 6 from Place d&#x27;Italie to Nation (although part of Line 5—some dating back to 2 October 1900—was incorporated into Line 6 on 12 October 1942). The Line 8 platforms opened on 5 May 1931 with the extension of the line from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Charenton.

It is named after Avenue Daumesnil, which honours General Pierre Yrieix Daumesnil (1776–1832) who lost a leg at the Battle of Wagram. This station is near Place Félix Éboué and its name plates refer to Félix Éboué (1884–1944), who brought Chad over to the Free French Forces in 1940 and as a result was made Governor General of French Equatorial Africa. It was the location of the &quot;Barrière de Reuilly&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the 19th century.

Nearby is the Promenade Plantée—a 4.5 km long elevated garden along the abandoned railway which led to the former Gare de la Bastille railway station.

Like a third of the stations on the network between 1974 and 1984, the platforms of both lines were modernized in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, in this case red on line 6 and blue for line 8, with the retention of the original bevelled white tiles in both cases.

As part of the RATP &quot;Un metro + beau program&quot;, the corridors of the station were renovated in turn and opened on 29 June 2014.

According to RATP estimates, the station saw 4,954,004 passengers enter in 2019, which places it in 86th position among metro stations for its attendance. In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, its annual traffic fell to 2,723,508 passengers, which ranked it 63rd.

In January 2021, the characteristic &quot;Motte&quot; masonry benches were removed from the platforms of Line 6, as well as the seats they had been surmounted until then, replaced by &quot;Akiko&quot; models of the same shade.

The station&#x27;s traffic gradually recovered in 2021 with 3,634,023 entrants recorded, relegating it to the 70th position of the stations of the network for its attendance that year.

==Passenger Services==
===Access===
The station has four entrances:
* Access 1 - &quot;Place Félix-Éboué&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase lined with an escalator going up, decorated with a candelabra and a Dervaux-type balustrade, leading to the south of this square to the right of No. 6;
* Access 2 - &quot;Rue Claude-Decaen&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase also decorated with a mast and a Dervaux surround, located south-east of the square facing no. 100 Rue Claude-Decaen;
* Access 3 - &quot;Avenue Daumesnil&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase lined with an escalator going up, decorated with a Guimard entrance classified as a historic monument (decree of 12 February 2016) and a Dervaux totem, located at the corner formed by Boulevard de Reuilly and Avenue Daumesnil opposite no. 199 of the latter;
* Access 4 - &quot;Rue de Reuilly&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase with a Dervaux balustrade, leading to the right of no. 118 of this street.
===Station layout===


==Platforms==
The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. Two per stopping point, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical.

They are furnished in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in both cases. Those of line 6 have two red illuminated canopies, benches, and corridor outlets in flat tiles of the same shade and burgundy &quot;Akiko&quot; seats (flat red tile benches surmounted by red &quot;Motte&quot; seats), while those of line 8 have the same components in blue as well as blue &quot;Motte&quot; seats, flat coloured tiles covering the tunnel exits. This decoration is married with the bevelled white tiles for both lines. On the one hand, it is applied to the wall and tunnel exits on line 6, the vault being coated and painted white, while it covers the walls and the vault on line 8. In addition, the name of the station, inscribed on enamelled plaques, is in Parisine font for line 6 and in capital letters for line 8. The advertising frames are respectively metallic and honey-coloured ceramic with plant motifs in the interwar style of the original CMP.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 29, 46, 64 and 71 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Bel-Air () is a station on Line 6 of the Paris Métro in the 12th arrondissement. The station is located in the middle of the Boulevard de Picpus, between the districts of Picpus and Bel-Air.

==History==
The station was opened on 1 March 1909 with the extension of the line from Place d&#x27;Italie to Nation. The station was closed during World War II and remained closed for a prolonged period, not reopening until 7 January 1963. It is named after the Bel-Air quarter. This station, along with the other elevated stations on the 1909 extension to Nation, were the last above ground stations on the Paris Métro until Créteil–L&#x27;Échat station was opened on Line 8 in 1973.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three accesses located in front of nos. 15, 32 and 34 of Boulevard de Picpus.

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
The station is in the open air at ground level, but the lines are underground to the north and to the south: the trains ascend to the surface before the station to descend when leaving it. This layout was required to clear the railway that connected the former Gare de la Bastille railway station (near the current metro station) to the valley of the Marne, via the former station of Reuilly near Bel-Air. This line was diverted to become part of RER A in 1969.

The station&#x27;s single entrance to the station leads to the back of trains from and to the front of trains from .

===Bus connections===
The station has no connection with the RATP bus network.

==Places of interest==

The old railway to Paris-Bastille was converted in the 1990s into the Promenade Plantée — a long elevated garden connecting to the Bastille to the Porte de Saint-Mandé. Cycling and rollerskating is allowed on this section.

The Rothschild Hospital is in the immediate vicinity and the Armand Trousseau Hospital for children is further off.

<text>In modern historiography, the Western Roman Empire was the western provinces of the Roman Empire, collectively, during any period in which they were administered separately from the eastern provinces by a separate, independent imperial court. Particularly during the period from AD 395 to 476, there were separate, coequal courts dividing the governance of the empire into the Western provinces and the Eastern provinces with a distinct imperial succession in the separate courts. The terms Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire were coined in modern times to describe political entities that were &quot;de facto&quot; independent; contemporary Romans did not consider the Empire to have been split into two empires but viewed it as a single polity governed by two imperial courts for administrative expediency. The Western Empire collapsed in 476, and the Western imperial court in Ravenna disappeared by AD 554, at the end of Justinian&#x27;s Gothic War. 

Though there were periods with more than one emperor ruling jointly before, the view that it was impossible for a single emperor to govern the entire Empire was institutionalized by emperor Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegrations of the Crisis of the Third Century. He introduced the system of the Tetrarchy in 286, with two senior emperors titled &quot;Augustus&quot;, one in the East and one in the West, each with an appointed subordinate and heir titled &quot;Caesar&quot;. Though the tetrarchic system would collapse in a matter of years, the East–West administrative division would endure in one form or another over the coming centuries. As such, the unofficial Western Roman Empire would exist intermittently in several periods between the 3rd and 5th centuries. Some emperors, such as Constantine I and Theodosius I, governed, if briefly, as the sole &quot;Augustus&quot; across the Roman Empire. On the death of Theodosius in 395, the empire was divided between his two infant sons, with Honorius as his successor in the West governing briefly from Mediolanum then from Ravenna, and Arcadius as his successor in the East governing from Constantinople.

In 476, after the Battle of Ravenna, the Roman army in the West suffered defeat at the hands of Odoacer and his Germanic &quot;foederati&quot;. Odoacer forced the abdication of the emperor Romulus Augustulus and became the first King of Italy. In 480, following the assassination of the previous Western emperor Julius Nepos, the Eastern emperor Zeno dissolved the Western court and proclaimed himself the sole emperor of the Roman Empire. The date of 476 was popularized by the 18th-century British historian Edward Gibbon as a demarcating event for the fall of the Western Roman Empire and is sometimes used to mark the transition from Antiquity to the Middle Ages. Odoacer&#x27;s Italy and other barbarian kingdoms, many of them representing former Western Roman allies that had been granted lands in return for military assistance, would maintain a pretense of Roman continuity through the continued use of the old Roman administrative systems and nominal subservience to the Eastern Roman court.

In the 6th century, Emperor Justinian I re-imposed direct Imperial rule on large parts of the former Western Roman Empire, including the prosperous regions of North Africa, the ancient Roman heartland of Italy and parts of Hispania. Political instability in the Eastern heartlands, combined with foreign invasions, plague, and religious differences, made efforts to retain control of these territories difficult and they were gradually lost for good. Though the Eastern Empire retained territories in the south of Italy until the eleventh century, the influence that the Empire had over Western Europe had diminished significantly. The papal coronation of the Frankish king Charlemagne as Roman Emperor in 800 marked a new imperial line that would evolve into the Holy Roman Empire, which presented a revival of the Imperial title in Western Europe but was in no meaningful sense an extension of Roman traditions or institutions. The Great Schism of 1054 between the churches of Rome and Constantinople further diminished any authority the emperor in Constantinople could hope to exert in the West.

==Background==

As the Roman Republic expanded, it reached a point where the central government in Rome could not effectively rule the distant provinces. Communications and transportation were especially problematic given the vast extent of the Empire. News of invasion, revolt, natural disasters, or epidemic outbreak was carried by ship or mounted postal service, often requiring much time to reach Rome and for Rome&#x27;s orders to be returned and acted upon. Therefore, provincial governors had &quot;de facto&quot; autonomy in the name of the Roman Republic. Governors had several duties, including the command of armies, handling the taxes of the province and serving as the province&#x27;s chief houses.

Prior to the establishment of the Empire, the territories of the Roman Republic had been divided in 43 BC among the members of the Second Triumvirate: Mark Antony, Octavian and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Antony received the provinces in the East: Achaea, Macedonia and Epirus (roughly modern Greece, Albania and the coast of Croatia), Bithynia, Pontus and Asia (roughly modern Turkey), Syria, Cyprus, and Cyrenaica. These lands had previously been conquered by Alexander the Great; thus, much of the aristocracy was of Greek origin. The whole region, especially the major cities, had been largely assimilated into Greek culture, Greek often serving as the lingua franca.
Octavian obtained the Roman provinces of the West: Italia (modern Italy), Gaul (modern France), Gallia Belgica (parts of modern Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), and Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal). These lands also included Greek and Carthaginian colonies in the coastal areas, though Celtic tribes such as Gauls and Celtiberians were culturally dominant. Lepidus received the minor province of Africa (roughly modern Tunisia). Octavian soon took Africa from Lepidus, while adding Sicilia (modern Sicily) to his holdings.

Upon the defeat of Mark Antony, a victorious Octavian controlled a united Roman Empire. The Empire featured many distinct cultures, all experienced a gradual &quot;Romanization&quot;. While the predominantly Greek culture of the East and the predominantly Latin culture of the West functioned effectively as an integrated whole, political and military developments would ultimately realign the Empire along those cultural and linguistic lines. More often than not, Greek and Latin practices (and to some extent the languages themselves) would be combined in fields such as history (e.g., those by Cato the Elder), philosophy and rhetoric.

===Rebellions and political developments===
Minor rebellions and uprisings were fairly common events throughout the Empire. Conquered tribes or oppressed cities would revolt, and the legions would be detached to crush the rebellion. While this process was simple in peacetime, it could be considerably more complicated in wartime. In a full-blown military campaign, the legions were far more numerousas, for example, those led by Vespasian in the First Jewish–Roman War. To ensure a commander&#x27;s loyalty, a pragmatic emperor might hold some members of the general&#x27;s family hostage. To this end, Nero effectively held Domitian and Quintus Petillius Cerialis, Governor of Ostia, who were respectively the younger son and brother-in-law of Vespasian. Nero&#x27;s rule was ended by a revolt of the Praetorian Guard, who had been bribed in the name of Galba. The Praetorian Guard, a figurative &quot;sword of Damocles&quot;, was often perceived as being of dubious loyalty, primarily due its role in court intrigues and in overthrowing several emperors, including Pertinax and Aurelian. Following their example, the legions at the borders increasingly participated in civil wars. For instance, legions stationed in Egypt and the eastern provinces would see significant participation in the civil war of 218 between Emperor Macrinus and Elagabalus.

As the Empire expanded, two key frontiers revealed themselves. In the West, behind the rivers Rhine and Danube, Germanic tribes were an important enemy. Augustus, the first emperor, had tried to conquer them but had pulled back after the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Whilst the Germanic tribes were formidable foes, the Parthian Empire in the East presented the greatest threat to the Empire. The Parthians were too remote and powerful to be conquered and there was a constant Parthian threat of invasion. The Parthians repelled several Roman invasions, and even after successful wars of conquest, such as those implemented by Trajan or Septimius Severus, the conquered territories were forsaken in attempts to ensure a lasting peace with the Parthians. The Parthian Empire would be succeeded by the Sasanian Empire, which continued hostilities with the Roman Empire.

Controlling the western border of Rome was reasonably easy because it was relatively close to Rome itself and also because of the disunity among the Germans. However, controlling both frontiers simultaneously during wartime was difficult. If the emperor was near the border in the East, the chances were high that an ambitious general would rebel in the West and vice versa. This wartime opportunism plagued many ruling emperors and indeed paved the road to power for several future emperors. By the time of the Crisis of the Third Century, usurpation became a common method of succession: Philip the Arab, Trebonianus Gallus and Aemilianus were all usurping generals-turned-emperors whose rule would end with usurpation by another powerful general.

The idea of co-emperorship was first tested by Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180), who decided to rule alongside his adoptive brother Lucius Verus. There was, however, much precedent. The consulate of the Republic was a twin magistracy, and earlier emperors had often had a subordinate lieutenant with many imperial offices. Many emperors had planned a joint succession in the past—Augustus planned to leave Gaius and Lucius Caesar as joint emperors on his death; Tiberius wished to have Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus do so as well; as Claudius with Nero and Britannicus. All of these arrangements had ended in failure, either through premature death (Gaius and Lucius) or murder (Gemellus and Britannicus). Marcus Aurelius ruled mostly from the West, while Verus spent most of his reign campaigning in the East, against Parthia. Verus accompanied Marcus at the start of the Marcomannic Wars, but died shortly after. Decades later, Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) appointed his sons Geta and Caracalla as joint heirs. However, Caracalla murdered his brother shortly after succeeding to the throne.

===Crisis of the Third Century===

With the assassination of the emperor Alexander Severus in March 235 by his own troops, the Roman Empire sank into a 50-year period of civil war now known as the Crisis of the Third Century. During this period, the Empire saw the combined pressures of barbarian invasions and migrations into Roman territory, civil wars, peasant rebellions and political instability, with multiple usurpers competing for power. The idea of dividing the empire was first developed in this time; Valerian and his son Gallienus divided the empire between them, the former ruling from the East and the latter from the West. However, Valerian was captured by the Sassanids at the Battle of Edessa, leaving Gallienus as sole emperor.

Saloninus, Gallienus&#x27; infant son, and the praetorian prefect Silvanus resided in Colonia Agrippina (modern Cologne) to solidify the loyalty of the local legions. Nevertheless, Postumusthe local governor of the German provincesrebelled, and his assault on Colonia Agrippina resulted in the deaths of Saloninus and the prefect. In the confusion that followed, an independent state known in modern historiography as the Gallic Empire emerged. Its capital was Augusta Treverorum (modern Trier), and it quickly expanded its control over the German and Gaulish provinces, all of Hispania and Britannia. It had its own senate, and a partial list of its consuls still survives. It maintained Roman religion, language, and culture, and was far more concerned with fighting the Germanic tribes, fending off Germanic incursions and restoring the security the Gallic provinces had enjoyed in the past, than in challenging the Roman central government. 

In the reign of Claudius Gothicus (268–270), large expanses of the Gallic Empire were restored to Roman rule. At roughly the same time, however, several eastern provinces seceded to form the Palmyrene Empire, under the rule of Queen Zenobia.

In 272, Emperor Aurelian finally managed to reclaim Palmyra and its territory for the empire. With the East secure, his attention turned to the West, invading the Gallic Empire a year later. Aurelian decisively defeated Tetricus I in the Battle of Châlons, and soon captured Tetricus and his son Tetricus II. Both Zenobia and the Tetrici were pardoned, although they were first paraded in a triumph.

===Tetrarchy===

Diocletian divided the Roman Empire when, in 286, he elevated Maximian to the rank of &quot;Augustus&quot; (emperor) and gave him control of the Western Empire, while he continued to rule the East. In 293, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus were appointed as their subordinate (caesars), as a way to avoid the civil unrest that had marked the 3rd century. This system effectively divided the Empire into four major regions, the First Tetrarchy: in the West, Maximian made Mediolanum (now Milan) his capital, and Constantius made Trier his. In the East, Galerius made his capital Sirmium and Diocletian made Nicomedia his. On 1 May 305, Diocletian and Maximian abdicated, replaced by Galerius and Constantius, who, in turn, appointed Maximinus II and Valerius Severus, respectively, as their caesars, thus creating the Second Tetrarchy.

The Tetrarchy collapsed after the unexpected death of Constantius in 306.
His son, Constantine, was declared Western emperor by the British legions, but several other claimants arose and attempted to seize the Western Empire. In 308, Galerius revived the Tetrarchy by dividing the Western Empire between Constantine and Licinius. However, Constantine was more interested in conquering the whole empire so, by 314, began to compete against Licinius, finally defeating him in 324 at the Battle of Chrysopolis. After Constantine unified the empire, he refounded the city of Byzantium in modern-day Turkey as &quot;Nova Roma&quot; (&quot;New Rome&quot;), later called Constantinople, and made it the capital of the Roman Empire. Although the Tetrarchy was ended, the concept of physically dividing the Roman Empire into East and a West continued, as happened after the deaths of Constantine and Theodosius I.

===Further divisions===
The Roman Empire was under the rule of a single emperor, but, with the death of Constantine in 337, the empire was partitioned between his surviving male heirs. Constantius, his third son and the second by his wife Fausta (Maximian&#x27;s daughter) received the eastern provinces, including Constantinople, Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, and Cyrenaica; Constantine II received Britannia, Gaul, Hispania, and Mauretania; and Constans, initially under the supervision of Constantine II, received Italy, Africa, Illyricum, Pannonia, Macedonia, and Achaea. The provinces of Thrace, Achaea and Macedonia were shortly controlled by Dalmatius, nephew of Constantine I and a &quot;caesar&quot;, not an &quot;Augustus&quot;, until his murder by his own soldiers in 337. The West was unified in 340 under Constans, who was assassinated in 350 under the order of the usurper Magnentius. After Magnentius lost the Battle of Mursa Major and committed suicide, a complete reunification of the whole Empire occurred under Constantius in 353.

Constantius II focused most of his power in the East. Under his rule, the city of Byzantium – only recently re-founded as Constantinople – was fully developed as a capital. At Constantinople, the political, economic and military control of the Eastern Empire&#x27;s resources would remain safe for centuries to come. The city was well fortified and located at the crossroads of several major trade and military routes. The site had been acknowledged for its strategic importance already by emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla, more than a century prior.

In 361, Constantius II became ill and died, and Constantius Chlorus&#x27; grandson Julian, who had served as Constantius II&#x27;s Caesar, assumed power. Julian was killed in 363 in the Battle of Samarra against the Sasanian Empire and was succeeded by Jovian, who ruled for only nine months. Following the death of Jovian, Valentinian I emerged as emperor in 364. He immediately divided the Empire once again, giving the eastern half to his brother Valens. Stability was not achieved for long in either half, as the conflicts with outside forces (barbarian tribes) intensified. In 376, the Visigoths, fleeing before the Ostrogoths, who in turn were fleeing before the Huns, were allowed to cross the river Danube and settle in the Balkans by the Eastern government. Mistreatment caused a full-scale rebellion, and in 378 they inflicted a crippling defeat on the Eastern Roman field army in the Battle of Adrianople, in which Emperor Valens also died. The defeat at Adrianople was shocking to the Romans, and forced them to negotiate with and settle the Visigoths within the borders of the Empire, where they would become semi-independent foederati under their own leaders.

More than in the East, there was also opposition to the Christianizing policy of the emperors in the western part of the Empire. In 379, Valentinian I&#x27;s son and successor Gratian declined to wear the mantle of Pontifex Maximus, and in 382 he rescinded the rights of pagan priests and removed the Altar of Victory from the Roman Curia, a decision which caused dissatisfaction among the traditionally pagan aristocracy of Rome. 

The political situation was unstable. In 383, a powerful and popular general named Magnus Maximus seized power in the West and forced Gratian&#x27;s half-brother Valentinian II to flee to the East for aid; in a destructive civil war the Eastern emperor Theodosius I restored him to power. In 392, the Frankish and pagan &quot;magister militum&quot; Arbogast assassinated Valentinian II and proclaimed an obscure senator named Eugenius as emperor. In 394 the forces of the two halves of the Empire again clashed with great loss of life. Again Theodosius I won, and he briefly ruled a united Empire until his death in 395. He was the last emperor to rule both parts of the Roman Empire before the West fragmented and collapsed. 

Theodosius I&#x27;s older son Arcadius inherited the eastern half while the younger Honorius got the western half. Both were still minors and neither was capable of ruling effectively. Honorius was placed under the tutelage of the half-Roman/half-barbarian &quot;magister militum&quot; Flavius Stilicho, while Rufinus became the power behind the throne in the east. Rufinus and Stilicho were rivals, and their disagreements would be exploited by the Gothic leader Alaric I who again rebelled in 408 following the massacre by Roman legions of thousands of barbarian families who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire.

Neither half of the Empire could raise forces sufficient even to subdue Alaric&#x27;s men, and both tried to use Alaric against the other half. Alaric himself tried to establish a long-term territorial and official base, but was never able to do so. Stilicho tried to defend Italy and bring the invading Goths under control, but to do so he stripped the Rhine frontier of troops and the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi invaded Gaul in large numbers in 406. Stilicho became a victim of court intrigues and was killed in 408. While the East began a slow recovery and consolidation, the West began to collapse entirely. Alaric&#x27;s men sacked Rome in 410.

==History==
===Reign of Honorius===

Honorius, the younger son of Theodosius I, was declared &quot;Augustus&quot; (and as such co-emperor with his father) on 23 January in 393, at the age of 9. Upon the death of Theodosius, Honorius inherited the throne of the West at the age of ten whilst his older brother Arcadius inherited the East. The western capital was initially Mediolanum, as it had been during previous divisions, but it was moved to Ravenna in 401 upon the entry of the Visigothic king Alaric I into Italy. Ravenna, protected by abundant marshes and strong fortifications, was far easier to defend and had easy access to the imperial fleet of the Eastern Empire but made it more difficult for the Roman military to defend the central parts of Italy from regular barbarian incursions. Ravenna would remain the western capital until 450 when Valentinian III moved the court back to Rome. Most western emperors from 450 until 475 reigned from Rome. The last de facto western emperor Romulus Augustulus resided in Ravenna from 475 until his deposition in 476 and Ravenna would later be the capital of both the Ostrogothic Kingdom and the Exarchate of Ravenna.

Despite the moved capital, economic power remained focused on Rome and its rich senatorial aristocracy which dominated much of Italy and Africa in particular. After Emperor Gallienus had banned senators from army commands in the mid-3rd century, the senatorial elite lost all experience of – and interest in – military life. In the early 5th century the wealthy landowning elite of the Roman Senate largely barred its tenants from military service, but it also refused to approve sufficient funding for maintaining a sufficiently powerful mercenary army to defend the entire Western Empire. The West&#x27;s most important military area had been northern Gaul and the Rhine frontier in the 4th century, when Trier frequently served as a military capital of sorts for the Empire. Many leading Western generals were barbarians.

The reign of Honorius was, even by Western Roman standards, chaotic and plagued by both internal and external struggles. The Visigothic &quot;foederati&quot; under Alaric, &quot;magister militum&quot; in Illyricum, rebelled in 395. Gildo, the &quot;Comes Africae&quot; and &quot;Magister utriusque militiae per Africam&quot;, rebelled in 397 and initiated the Gildonic War. Stilicho managed to subdue Gildo but was campaigning in Raetia when the Visigoths entered Italy in 402. Stilicho, hurrying back to aid in defending Italy, summoned legions in Gaul and Britain with which he managed to defeat Alaric twice before agreeing to allow him to retreat back to Illyria.
The weakening of the frontiers in Britain and Gaul had dire consequences for the Empire. As the imperial government was not providing the military protection the northern provinces expected and needed, numerous usurpers arose in Britain, including Marcus (406–407), Gratian (407), and Constantine III who invaded Gaul in 407. Britain was effectively abandoned by the empire by 410 due to the lack of resources and the need to look after more important frontiers. The weakening of the Rhine frontier allowed multiple barbarian tribes, including the Vandals, Alans and Suebi, to cross the river and enter Roman territory in 406.

Honorius was convinced by the minister Olympius that Stilicho was conspiring to overthrow him, and so arrested and executed Stilicho in 408. Olympius headed a conspiracy that orchestrated the deaths of key individuals related to the faction of Stilicho, including his son and the families of many of his federated troops. This led many of the soldiers to instead join with Alaric, who returned to Italy in 409 and met little opposition. Despite attempts by Honorius to reach a settlement and six legions of Eastern Roman soldiers sent to support him, the negotiations between Alaric and Honorius broke down in 410 and Alaric sacked the city of Rome. Though the sack was relatively mild and Rome was no longer the capital of even the Western Empire, the event shocked people across both halves of the Empire as this was the first time Rome (viewed at least as the symbolic heart of the Empire) had fallen to a foreign enemy since the Gallic invasions of the 4th century BC. The Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius II, the successor of Arcadius, declared three days of mourning in Constantinople.

Without Stilicho and following the sack of Rome, Honorius&#x27; reign grew more chaotic. The usurper Constantine III had stripped Roman Britain of its defenses when he crossed over to Gaul in 407, leaving the Romanized population subject to invasions, first by the Picts and then by the Saxons, Angli, and the Jutes who began to settle permanently from about 440 onwards. After Honorius accepted Constantine as co-emperor, Constantine&#x27;s general in Hispania, Gerontius, proclaimed Maximus as emperor. With the aid of general Constantius, Honorius defeated Gerontius and Maximus in 411 and shortly thereafter captured and executed Constantine III. With Constantius back in Italy, the Gallo-Roman senator Jovinus revolted after proclaiming himself emperor, with the support of the Gallic nobility and the barbarian Burgundians and Alans. Honorius turned to the Visigoths under King Athaulf for support. Athaulf defeated and executed Jovinus and his proclaimed co-emperor Sebastianus in 413, around the same time as another usurper arose in Africa, Heraclianus. Heraclianus attempted to invade Italy but failed and retreated to Carthage, where he was killed.

With the Roman legions withdrawn, northern Gaul became increasingly subject to Frankish influence, the Franks naturally adopting a leading role in the region. In 418, Honorius granted southwestern Gaul (Gallia Aquitania) to the Visigoths as a vassal federation. Honorius removed the local imperial governors, leaving the Visigoths and the provincial Roman inhabitants to conduct their own affairs. As such, the first of the &quot;barbarian kingdoms&quot;, the Visigothic Kingdom, was formed.

===Escalating barbarian conflicts===
Honorius&#x27; death in 423 was followed by turmoil until the Eastern Roman government installed Valentinian III as Western emperor in Ravenna by force of arms, with Galla Placidia acting as regent during her son&#x27;s minority. Theodosius II, the Eastern emperor, had hesitated to announce the death of Honorius and in the ensuing interregnum, Joannes was nominated as Western emperor. Joannes&#x27; rule was short and the forces of the East defeated and executed him in 425.After a violent struggle with several rivals, and against Placidia&#x27;s wish, Aetius rose to the rank of &quot;magister militum&quot;. Aetius was able to stabilize the Western Empire&#x27;s military situation somewhat, relying heavily on his Hunnic allies. With their help Aetius undertook extensive campaigns in Gaul, defeating the Visigoths in 437 and 438 but suffering a defeat himself in 439, ending the conflict in a status quo ante with a treaty.

Meanwhile, pressure from the Visigoths and a rebellion by Bonifacius, the governor of Africa, induced the Vandals under King Gaiseric to cross from Spain to Tingitana in what is now Morocco in 429. They temporarily halted in Numidia in 435 before moving eastward. With Aetius occupied in Gaul, the Western Roman government could do nothing to prevent the Vandals conquering the wealthy African provinces, culminating in the fall of Carthage on 19October 439 and the establishment of the Vandal Kingdom. By the 400s, Italy and Rome itself were dependent on the taxes and foodstuffs from these provinces, leading to an economic crisis. With Vandal fleets becoming an increasing danger to Roman sea trade and the coasts and islands of the western and central Mediterranean, Aetius coordinated a counterattack against the Vandals in 440, organizing a large army in Sicily.

However, the plans for retaking Africa had to be abandoned due to the immediate need to combat the invading Huns, who in 444 were united under their ambitious king Attila. Turning against their former ally, the Huns became a formidable threat to the Empire. Aetius transferred his forces to the Danube, though Attila concentrated on raiding the Eastern Roman provinces in the Balkans, providing temporary relief to the Western Empire. In 449, Attila received a message from Honoria, Valentinian III&#x27;s sister, offering him half the western empire if he would rescue her from an unwanted marriage that her brother was forcing her into. With a pretext to invade the West, Attila secured peace with the Eastern court and crossed the Rhine in early 451. With Attila wreaking havoc in Gaul, Aetius gathered a coalition of Roman and Germanic forces, including Visigoths and Burgundians, and prevented the Huns from taking the city of Aurelianum, forcing them into retreat. At the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, the Roman-Germanic coalition met and defeated the Hunnic forces, though Attila escaped.

Attila regrouped and invaded Italy in 452. With Aetius not having enough forces to attack him, the road to Rome was open. Valentinian sent Pope Leo I and two leading senators to negotiate with Attila. This embassy, combined with a plague among Attila&#x27;s troops, the threat of famine, and news that the Eastern emperor Marcian had launched an attack on the Hun homelands along the Danube, forced Attila to turn back and leave Italy. When Attila died unexpectedly in 453, the power struggle that erupted between his sons ended the threat posed by the Huns.

===Internal unrest and Majorian===
Valentinian III was intimidated by Aetius and was encouraged by the Roman senator Petronius Maximus and the chamberlain Heraclius to assassinate him. When Aetius was at court in Ravenna delivering a financial account, Valentinian suddenly leaped from his seat and declared that he would no longer be the victim of Aetius&#x27; drunken depravities. Aetius attempted to defend himself from the charges, but Valentinian drew his sword and struck the weaponless Aetius on the head, killing him on the spot. On 16 March the following year, Valentinian himself was killed by supporters of the dead general, possibly acting for Petronius Maximus. With the end of the Theodosian dynasty, Petronius Maximus proclaimed himself emperor during the ensuing period of unrest.

Petronius was not able to take effective control of the significantly weakened and unstable Empire. He broke the betrothal between Huneric, son of the Vandal king Gaiseric, and Eudocia, daughter of Valentinian III. This was seen as a just cause of war by King Gaiseric, who set sail to attack Rome. Petronius and his supporters attempted to flee the city at the sight of the approaching Vandals, only to be stoned to death by a Roman mob. Petronius had reigned only 11 weeks. With the Vandals at the gates, Pope Leo I requested that the King not destroy the ancient city or murder its inhabitants, to which Gaiseric agreed and the city gates were opened to him. Though keeping his promise, Gaiseric looted great amounts of treasure and damaged objects of cultural significance such as the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. The severity of the Vandal sack of 455 is disputed, though with the Vandals plundering the city for a full fourteen days as opposed to the Visigothic sack of 410, where the Visigoths only spent three days in the city, it was likely more thorough.

Avitus, a prominent general under Petronius, was proclaimed emperor by the Visigothic king Theodoric II and accepted as such by the Roman Senate. Though supported by the Gallic provinces and the Visigoths, Avitus was resented in Italy due to ongoing food shortages caused by Vandal control of trade routes, and for using a Visigothic imperial guard. He disbanded his guard due to popular pressure, and the Suebian general Ricimer used the opportunity to depose Avitus, counting on popular discontent. After the deposition of Avitus, the Eastern emperor Leo I did not select a new western &quot;Augustus&quot;. The prominent general Majorian defeated an invading force of Alemanni and was subsequently proclaimed Western emperor by the army and eventually accepted as such by Leo.

Majorian was the last Western emperor to attempt to recover the Western Empire with his own military forces. To prepare, Majorian significantly strengthened the Western Roman army by recruiting large numbers of barbarian mercenaries, among them the Gepids, Ostrogoths, Rugii, Burgundians, Huns, Bastarnae, Suebi, Scythians and Alans, and built two fleets, one at Ravenna, to combat the strong Vandalic fleet. Majorian personally led the army to wage war in Gaul, leaving Ricimer in Italy. The Gallic provinces and the Visigothic Kingdom had rebelled following the deposition of Avitus, refusing to acknowledge Majorian as lawful emperor. At the Battle of Arelate, Majorian decisively defeated the Visigoths under Theoderic II and forced them to relinquish their great conquests in Hispania and return to &quot;foederati&quot; status. Majorian then entered the Rhone Valley, where he defeated the Burgundians and reconquered the rebel city of Lugdunum. With Gaul back under Roman control, Majorian turned his eyes to the Vandals and Africa. Not only did the Vandals pose a constant danger to coastal Italy and trade in the Mediterranean, but the province they ruled was economically vital to the survival of the West. Majorian began a campaign to fully reconquer Hispania to use it as a base for the reconquest of Africa. Throughout 459, Majorian campaigned against the Suebi in northwestern Hispania.

The Vandals began to increasingly fear a Roman invasion. King Gaiseric tried to negotiate a peace with Majorian, who rejected the proposal. In the wake of this, Gaiseric devastated Mauretania, part of his own kingdom, fearing that the Roman army would land there. Having regained control of Hispania, Majorian intended to use his fleet at Carthaginiensis to attack the Vandals. Before he could, the fleet was destroyed, allegedly by traitors paid by the Vandals. Deprived of his fleet, Majorian had to cancel his attack on the Vandals and conclude a peace with Gaiseric. Disbanding his barbarian forces, Majorian intended to return to Rome and issue reforms, stopping at Arelate on his way. Here, Ricimer deposed and arrested him in 461, having gathered significant aristocratic opposition against Majorian. After five days of beatings and torture, Majorian was beheaded near the river Iria.

===Collapse===
The final collapse of the Empire in the West was marked by increasingly ineffectual puppet emperors dominated by their Germanic &quot;magistri militum&quot;. The most pointed example of this is Ricimer, who effectively became a &quot;shadow emperor&quot; following the depositions of Avitus and Majorian. Unable to take the throne for himself due to his barbarian heritage, Ricimer appointed a series of puppet emperors who could do little to halt the collapse of Roman authority and the loss of the territories re-conquered by Majorian. The first of these puppet emperors, Libius Severus, had no recognition outside of Italy, with the Eastern emperor Leo I and provincial governors in Gaul and Illyria all refusing to recognize him.

Severus died in 465 and Leo I, with the consent of Ricimer, appointed the capable Eastern general Anthemius as Western emperor following an eighteen-month interregnum. The relationship between Anthemius and the East was good, Anthemius is the last Western emperor recorded in an Eastern law, and the two courts conducted a joint operation to retake Africa from the Vandals, culminating in the disastrous Battle of Cape Bon in 468. In addition Anthemius conducted failed campaigns against the Visigoths, hoping to halt their expansion.

The trial and subsequent execution of Romanus, an Italian senator and friend of Ricimer, on the grounds of treachery in 470 made Ricimer hostile to Anthemius. Following two years of ill feeling, Ricimer deposed and killed Anthemius in 472, elevating Olybrius to the Western throne. During the brief reign of Olybrius, Ricimer died and his nephew Gundobad succeeded him as &quot;magister militum&quot;. After only seven months of rule, Olybrius died of dropsy. Gundobad elevated Glycerius to Western emperor. The Eastern Empire had rejected Olybrius and also rejected Glycerius, instead supporting a candidate of their own, Julius Nepos, &quot;magister militum&quot; in Dalmatia. With the support of Eastern emperors Leo II and Zeno, Julius Nepos crossed the Adriatic Sea in the spring of 474 to depose Glycerius. At the arrival of Nepos in Italy, Glycerius abdicated without a fight and was allowed to live out his life as the Bishop of Salona.

The brief rule of Nepos in Italy ended in 475 when Orestes, a former secretary of Attila and the &quot;magister militum&quot; of Julius Nepos, took control of Ravenna and forced Nepos to flee by ship to Dalmatia. Later in the same year, Orestes crowned his own young son as Western emperor under the name Romulus Augustus. Romulus Augustus was not recognised as Western emperor by the Eastern Court, who maintained that Nepos was the only legal Western emperor, reigning in exile from Dalmatia.

On 4 September 476, Odoacer, leader of the Germanic &quot;foederati&quot; in Italy, captured Ravenna, killed Orestes and deposed Romulus. Though Romulus was deposed, Nepos did not return to Italy and continued to reign as Western emperor from Dalmatia, with support from Constantinople. Odoacer proclaimed himself ruler of Italy and began to negotiate with the Eastern emperor Zeno. Zeno eventually granted Odoacer patrician status as recognition of his authority and accepted him as his viceroy of Italy. Zeno, however, insisted that Odoacer had to pay homage to Julius Nepos as the emperor of the Western Empire. Odoacer accepted this condition and issued coins in the name of Julius Nepos throughout Italy. This, however, was mainly an empty political gesture, as Odoacer never returned any real power or territories to Nepos. The murder of Nepos in 480 prompted Odoacer to invade Dalmatia, annexing it to his Kingdom of Italy.

===Fall of the Empire===

By convention, the Western Roman Empire is deemed to have ended on 4 September 476, when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustus, but the historical record calls this determination into question. Indeed, the deposition of Romulus Augustus received very little attention in contemporary times. Romulus was a usurper in the eyes of the Eastern Roman Empire and the remaining territories of Western Roman control outside of Italy, with the previous emperor Julius Nepos still being alive and claiming to rule the Western Empire in Dalmatia. Furthermore, the Western court had lacked true power and had been subject to Germanic aristocrats for decades, with most of its legal territory being under control of various barbarian kingdoms. With Odoacer recognising Julius Nepos, and later the Eastern emperor Zeno, as his sovereign, nominal Roman control continued in Italy. Syagrius, who had managed to preserve Roman sovereignty in an exclave in northern Gaul (a realm today known as the Domain of Soissons) also recognized Nepos as his sovereign and the legitimate Western emperor.

The authority of Julius Nepos as emperor was accepted not only by Odoacer in Italy, but by the Eastern Empire and Syagrius in Gaul (who had not recognized Romulus Augustulus). Nepos was murdered by his own soldiers in 480, a plot some attribute to Odoacer or the previous, deposed emperor Glycerius, and the Eastern emperor Zeno chose not to appoint a new Western emperor. Zeno, recognizing that no true Roman control remained over the territories legally governed by the Western court, instead chose to abolish the juridical division of the position of emperor and declared himself the sole emperor of the Roman Empire. Zeno became the first sole Roman emperor since the division after Theodosius I, 85 years prior, and the position would never again be divided. As such, the (eastern) Roman emperors after 480 are the successors of the western ones, albeit only in a juridical sense. These emperors would continue to rule the Roman Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, nearly a thousand years later. As 480 marks the end of the juridical division of the empire into two imperial courts, some historians refer to the death of Nepos and abolition of the Western Empire by Zeno as the end of the Western Roman Empire.

Despite the fall, or abolition, of the Western Empire, many of the new kings of western Europe continued to operate firmly within a Roman administrative framework. This is especially true in the case of the Ostrogoths, who came to rule Italy after Odoacer. They continued to use the administrative systems of Odoacer&#x27;s kingdom, essentially those of the Western Roman Empire, and administrative positions continued to be staffed exclusively by Romans. The Senate continued to function as it always had, and the laws of the Empire were recognized as ruling the Roman population, though the Goths were ruled by their own traditional laws. Western Roman administrative institutions, in particular those of Italy, thus continued to be used during &quot;barbarian&quot; rule and after the forces of the Eastern Roman empire re-conquered some of the formerly imperial territories. Some historians thus refer to the reorganizations of Italy and abolition of the old and separate Western Roman administrative units, such as the Praetorian prefecture of Italy, during the sixth century as the &quot;true&quot; fall of the Western Roman Empire.

Roman cultural traditions continued throughout the territory of the Western Empire for long after its disappearance, and a recent school of interpretation argues that the great political changes can more accurately be described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall.

==Political aftermath==
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic kingdoms, often referred to as &quot;barbarian kingdoms&quot;, founded during its collapse continued to grow and prosper. Their beginnings, together with the end of the Western Roman Empire, mark the transition from Late Antiquity to the Middle Ages. The practices of the barbarian kingdoms gradually replaced the old Roman institutions, specifically in the praetorian prefectures of Gaul and Italy, during the sixth and seventh centuries. In many places, the Roman institutions collapsed along with the economic stability. In some regions, notably Gaul and Italy, the settlement of barbarians on former Roman lands seems to have caused relatively little disruption, with barbarian rulers using and modifying the Roman systems already in place. The Germanic kingdoms in Italy, Hispania and Gaul continued to recognise the emperor in Constantinople as a somewhat nominal sovereign, the Visigoths minted coins in their names until the reign of Justinian I in the sixth century.

Some territories under direct Roman control continued to exist in the West even after 480. The Domain of Soissons, a rump state in Northern Gaul ruled by Syagrius, survived until 486 when it was conquered by the Franks under King Clovis I after the Battle of Soissons. Syagrius was known as the &quot;King of the Romans&quot; by the Germanic peoples of the region and repeatedly claimed that he was merely governing a Roman province, not an independent realm. Under Clovis I from the 480s to 511, the Franks would come to develop into a great regional power. After their conquest of Soissons, the Franks defeated the Alemanni in 504 and conquered all Visigothic territory north of the Pyrenees other than Septimania in 507. Relations between the Franks and the Eastern Empire appear to have been positive, with Emperor Anastasius granting Clovis the title of consul following his victory against the Visigoths. At the time of its dissolution in the 800s, the Frankish Kingdom had lasted far longer than the other migration period barbarian kingdoms. Its divided successors would develop into the medieval states of France (initially known as West Francia) and Germany (initially known as East Francia).

A Mauro-Roman realm survived in the province of Mauretania Caesariensis until the early 8th century. An inscription on a fortification at the ruined city of Altava from the year 508 identifies a man named Masuna as the king of &quot;Regnum Maurorum et Romanarum&quot;, the Kingdom of the Moors and Romans. It is possible that Masuna is the same man as the &quot;Massonas&quot; who allied himself with the forces of the Eastern Roman Empire against the Vandals in 535. This Kingdom was defeated by the Eastern Roman &quot;magister militum&quot; Gennadius in 578 and its coastal territories were incorporated into the Empire once more.

===Germanic Italy===
The deposition of Romulus Augustus and the rise of Odoacer as ruler of Italy in 476 received very little attention at the time. Overall, very little changed for the people; there was still a Roman emperor in Constantinople to whom Odoacer had subordinated himself. Interregna had been experienced at many points in the West before and the deposition of Romulus Augustus was nothing out of the ordinary. Odoacer saw his rule as entirely in the tradition of the Roman Empire, not unlike Ricimer, and he effectively ruled as an imperial &quot;governor&quot; of Italy and was even awarded the title of &quot;patricius&quot;. Odoacer ruled using the Roman administrative systems already in place and continued to mint coins with the name and portrait of Julius Nepos until 480 and later with the name and portrait of the Eastern &quot;Augustus&quot;, rather than in his own name.

When Nepos was murdered in Dalmatia in 480, Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins and established his own rule in Dalmatia at the same time. Odoacer established his power with the loyal support of the Roman Senate, a legislative body that had continued even without an emperor residing in Italy. Indeed, the Senate seems to have increased in power under Odoacer. For the first time since the mid-3rd century, copper coins were issued with the legend &quot;S C&quot; (&quot;Senatus Consulto&quot;). These coins were copied by Vandals in Africa and also formed the basis of the currency reform carried out by Emperor Anastasius in the East.

Under Odoacer, Western consuls continued to be appointed as they had been under the Western Roman Empire and were accepted by the Eastern Court, the first being Caecina Decius Maximus Basilus in 480. Basilus was made the praetorian prefect of Italy in 483, another traditional position which continued to exist under Odoacer. Eleven further consuls were appointed by the Senate under Odoacer from 480 to 493 and one further Praetorian Prefect of Italy was appointed, Caecina Mavortius Basilius Decius (486–493).

Though Odoacer ruled as a Roman governor would have and maintained himself as a subordinate to the remaining Empire, the Eastern emperor Zeno began to increasingly see him as a rival. Thus, Zeno promised Theoderic the Great of the Ostrogoths, &quot;foederati&quot; of the Eastern Court, control over the Italian peninsula if he was able to defeat Odoacer. Theoderic led the Ostrogoths across the Julian Alps and into Italy and defeated Odoacer in battle twice in 489. Following four years of hostilities between them, John, the Bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty in 493 between Odoacer and Theoderic whereby they agreed to rule Ravenna and Italy jointly. Theoderic entered Ravenna on 5March and Odoacer was dead ten days later, killed by Theoderic after sharing a meal with him.

Theoderic inherited Odoacer&#x27;s role as acting viceroy for Italy and ostensibly a &quot;patricius&quot; and subject of the emperor in Constantinople. This position was recognized by Emperor Anastasius in 497, four years after Theoderic had defeated Odoacer. Though Theodoric acted as an independent ruler, he meticulously preserved the outward appearance of his subordinate position. Theoderic continued to use the administrative systems of Odoacer&#x27;s kingdom, essentially those of the Western Roman Empire, and administrative positions continued to be staffed exclusively by Romans. The senate continued to function as it always had and the laws of the Empire were recognized as ruling the Roman population, though the Goths were ruled by their own traditional laws. As a subordinate, Theoderic did not have the right to issue his own laws, only edicts or clarifications. The army and military offices were exclusively staffed by the Goths, however, who largely settled in northern Italy.

Though acting as a subordinate in domestic affairs, Theodoric acted increasingly independent in his foreign policies. Seeking to counterbalance the influence of the Empire in the East, Theoderic married his daughters to the Visigothic king Alaric II and the Burgundian prince Sigismund. His sister Amalfrida was married to the Vandal king Thrasamund and he married Audofleda, sister of the Frankish king Clovis I, himself. Through these alliances and occasional conflicts, the territory controlled by Theoderic in the early sixth century nearly constituted a restored Western Roman Empire. Ruler of Italy since 493, Theoderic became king of the Visigoths in 511 and exerted hegemony over the Vandals in North Africa between 521 and 523. As such, his rule extended throughout the western Mediterranean. The Western imperial regalia, housed in Constantinople since the deposition of Romulus Augustulus in 476, were returned to Ravenna by Emperor Anastasius in 497. Theoderic, by now Western emperor in all but name, could not, however, assume an imperial title, not only because the notion of a separate Western court had been abolished but also due to his &quot;barbarian&quot; heritage, which, like that of Ricimer before him, would have barred him from assuming the throne.

With the death of Theodoric in 526, his network of alliances began to collapse. The Visigoths regained autonomy under King Amalaric and the Ostrogoths&#x27; relations with the Vandals turned increasingly hostile under the reign of their new king Athalaric, a child under the regency of his mother Amalasuntha. After the collapse of Theoderic&#x27;s control of the western Mediterranean, the Frankish Kingdom rose to become the most powerful of the barbarian kingdoms, having taken control of most of Gaul in the absence of Roman governance.

Amalasuntha continued the policies of conciliation between the Goths and Romans, supporting the new Eastern emperor Justinian I and allowing him to use Sicily as a staging point during the reconquest of Africa in the Vandalic War. With the death of Athalaric in 534, Amalasuntha crowned her cousin and only relative Theodahad as king, hoping for his support. Instead, Amalasuntha was imprisoned and, even though Theodahad assured Emperor Justinian of her safety, she was executed shortly after. This served as an ideal &quot;casus belli&quot; for Justinian, who prepared to invade and reclaim the Italian peninsula for the Roman Empire.

===Imperial reconquest===

With Emperor Zeno having juridically reunified the Empire into one imperial court, the remaining Eastern Roman Empire continued to lay claim to the areas previously controlled by the Western court throughout Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Though military campaigns had been conducted by the Western court prior to 476 with the aim of recapturing lost territory, most notably under Majorian, the reconquests, if successful at all, were only momentary. It was as a result of the campaigns of the generals Belisarius and Narses on behalf of the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I from 533 to 554 that long-lasting reconquests of Roman lands were witnessed.

Despite also suffering from barbarian incursions, the Eastern Empire had survived the fifth century mostly intact. The Western Roman Empire, less urbanized than the Eastern and more thinly populated, may have experienced an economic decline throughout the Late Empire in some provinces. Southern Italy, northern Gaul (except for large towns and cities), and to some extent Spain and the Danubian areas may have suffered. The East fared better economically, especially as Emperors such as Constantine the Great and Constantius II had invested heavily in the eastern economy. As a result, the Eastern Empire could afford large numbers of professional soldiers and to augment them with mercenaries, while the Western Roman Empire could not afford this to the same extent. Even after major defeats, the East could, although not without difficulties, buy off its enemies with a ransom or &quot;protection money&quot;. Numbering more than 300,000 soldiers, the Eastern Roman army of Justinian I was among the most powerful in the world.

Unlike the Visigoths and Ostrogoths, the Vandals in Africa minted their own coinage and were both &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; independent, often being enemies of both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. With the pro-Roman Vandal king Hilderic having been deposed by Gelimer in 530, Justinian prepared an expedition led by Belisarius. It swiftly retook North Africa between June 533 and March 534, returning the wealthy province to Roman rule. Following the reconquest, Justinian swiftly reintroduced the Roman administrations of the province, establishing a new Praetorian Prefecture of Africa and taking measures to decrease Vandal influence, eventually leading to the complete disappearance of the Vandalic people.

Following the execution of the pro-Roman Ostrogoth queen Amalasuntha and the refusal of Ostrogoth King Theodahad to renounce his control of Italy, Justinian ordered the expedition to move on to reconquer Italy, ancient heartland of the Empire. From 534 to 540, the Roman forces campaigned in Italy and captured Ravenna, the Ostrogothic and formerly Western Roman capital, in 540. The Gothic resistance revived under King Totila in 541. They were finally defeated following campaigns by the Roman general Narses, who also repelled invasions into Italy by the Franks and Alemanni, though some cities in northern Italy continued to hold out until the 560s. Justinian promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction to reorganize the governance of Italy and the province was returned to Roman rule. The end of the conflict saw Italy devastated and considerably depopulated, which, combined with the disastrous effects of the Plague of Justinian, made it difficult to retain over the following centuries.

At the time of the collapse of the Western Empire in 476–480, the Visigoths controlled large areas of southern Gaul as well as a majority of Hispania. Their increased domain had been partly conquered and partly awarded to them by the Western emperor Avitus in the 450s–60s. Justinian undertook some limited campaigns against them, recovering portions of the southern coast of the Iberian peninsula. Here, the province of Spania would last until the 620s, when the Visigoths under King Suintila reconquered the south coast. These regions remained under Roman control throughout the reign of Justinian. Three years after his death, the Lombards invaded Italy. The Lombards conquered large parts of the devastated peninsula in the late 500s, establishing the Lombard Kingdom. They were in constant conflict with the Exarchate of Ravenna, a polity established to replace the old Praetorian Prefecture of Italy and enforce Roman rule in Italy. The wealthiest parts of the province, including the cities of Rome and Ravenna, remained securely in Roman hands under the Exarchate throughout the seventh century.

Although other Eastern emperors occasionally attempted to campaign in the West, none were as successful as Justinian. After 600, events conspired to drive the Western provinces out of Constantinople&#x27;s control, with imperial attention focused on the pressing issues of war with Sasanian Persia and then the rise of Islam. For a while, the West remained important, with Emperor Constans II ruling from Syracuse in Sicily a Roman Empire that still stretched from North Africa to the Caucasus in the 660s. Thereafter, imperial attention declined, with Constantinople itself being besieged in the 670s, renewed war with the Arabs in the 680s, and then a period of chaos between 695 and 717, during which time Africa was finally lost once and for all, being conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate. Through reforms and military campaigns, Emperor Leo III attempted to restore order in the Empire, but his doctrinal reforms, known as the Iconoclastic Controversy, were extremely unpopular in the West and were condemned by Pope Gregory III.

The Roman Empire was not the only Christian nation affected by the Islamic conquests, as the Visigothic Kingdom finally fell to the Umayyad Caliphate in the 720s. The Kingdom of Asturias was founded by Pelagius of Asturias around the same time and was the first Christian realm to be established in Iberia following the defeat of the Visigoths. Asturias would be transformed into the Kingdom of León in 924, which would develop into the predecessors of modern-day Spain.

The religious disagreements between Rome and Constantinople eventually led to the breakdown in imperial rule over Rome itself, and the gradual transition of the Exarchate of Ravenna into the independent Papal States, led by the Pope. In an attempt to gain support against the Lombards, the Pope called for aid from the Frankish Kingdom instead of the Eastern Empire, eventually crowning the Frankish king Charlemagne as &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; in AD 800. Though this coronation was strongly opposed by the Eastern Empire, there was little they could do as their influence in Western Europe decreased. After a series of small wars in the 810s, Emperor Michael I recognized Charlemagne as an &quot;Emperor&quot;. He refused to recognize him as a &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; (a title which Michael reserved for himself and his successors), instead recognizing him as the slightly less prestigious &quot;Emperor of the Franks&quot;.

Imperial rule continued in Sicily throughout the eighth century, with the island slowly being overrun by the Arabs during the course of the ninth century. In Italy, a few strongholds in Calabria provided a base for a later, modest imperial expansion, which reached its peak in the early eleventh century, with most of southern Italy under Roman rule of a sort. This, however, was undone by further civil wars in the Empire, and the slow conquest of the region by the Empire&#x27;s former mercenaries, the Normans, who finally put an end to imperial rule in Western Europe in 1071 with the conquest of Bari. The last emperor to attempt reconquests in the West was Manuel I Komnenos, who invaded southern Italy during a war with the Norman Kingdom of Sicily in the 1150s. The city of Bari willingly opened its gates to the emperor and after successes in taking other cities in the region, Manuel dreamed of a restored Roman Empire and a union between the churches of Rome and Constantinople, separated since the schism of 1054. Despite initial successes and Papal support, the campaign was unsuccessful and Manuel was forced to return east.

==Legacy==

As the Western Roman Empire crumbled, the new Germanic rulers who conquered its constituent provinces maintained most Roman laws and traditions. Many of the invading Germanic tribes were already Christianized, although most were followers of Arianism. They quickly changed their adherence to the state church of the Roman Empire. This helped cement the loyalty of the local Roman populations, as well as the support of the powerful Bishop of Rome. Although they initially continued to recognize indigenous tribal laws, they were more influenced by Roman law and gradually incorporated it. Roman law, particularly the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; collected on the orders of Justinian I, is the basis of modern civil law. In contrast, common law is based on Germanic Anglo-Saxon law. Civil law is by far the most widespread system of law in the world, in force in some form in about 150 countries.

Latin as a language did not disappear. Vulgar Latin combined with neighboring Germanic and Celtic languages, giving rise to modern Romance languages such as Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and a large number of minor languages and dialects. Today, more than 900 million people are native speakers of Romance languages worldwide. In addition, many Romance languages are used as lingua francas by non-native speakers.

Latin also influenced Germanic languages such as English and German. It survives in a &quot;purer&quot; form as the language of the Catholic Church; the Catholic Mass was spoken exclusively in Latin until 1969. As such it was also used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; by ecclesiasticals. It remained the language of medicine, law, and diplomacy, as well as of intellectuals and scholarship, well into the 18th century. Since then the use of Latin has declined with the growth of other &quot;lingua francas&quot;, especially English and French. The Latin alphabet was expanded due to the split of I into I and J, and of V into U, V, and, in places (especially Germanic languages and Polish), W. Latin script is the basis for the largest number of alphabets of any writing system and is the
most widely adopted writing system in the world. Roman numerals continue to be used in some fields and situations, though they have largely been replaced by Arabic numerals.

A very visible legacy of the Western Roman Empire is the Catholic Church. Church institutions slowly began to replace Roman ones in the West, even helping to negotiate the safety of Rome during the late 5th century. As Rome was invaded by Germanic tribes, many assimilated, and by the middle of the medieval period ( 9th and 10th centuries) the central, western, and northern parts of Europe had been largely converted to Roman Catholicism and acknowledged the Pope as the Vicar of Christ. The first of the Barbarian kings to convert to the Church of Rome was Clovis I of the Franks; other kingdoms, such as the Visigoths, later followed suit to garner favor with the papacy.

When Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; in 800, he both severed ties with the outraged Eastern Empire and established the precedent that no man in Western Europe would be emperor without a papal coronation. Although the power the Pope wielded changed significantly throughout the subsequent periods, the office itself has remained as the head of the Catholic Church and the head of state of the Vatican City. The Pope has consistently held the title of &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; since before the fall of the Western Roman Empire and retains it to this day; this title formerly used by the high priest of the Roman polytheistic religion, one of whom was Julius Caesar.

The Roman Senate survived the initial collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Its authority increased under the rule of Odoacer and later the Ostrogoths, evident by the Senate in 498 managing to install Symmachus as pope despite both Theodoric of Italy and Emperor Anastasius supporting another candidate, Laurentius. Exactly when the senate disappeared is unclear, but the institution is known to have survived at least into the 6th century, inasmuch as gifts from the senate were received by Emperor Tiberius II in 578 and 580. The traditional senate building, Curia Julia, was rebuilt into a church under Pope Honorius I in 630, probably with permission from the Eastern emperor, Heraclius.

===Nomenclature===
Marcellinus Comes, a sixth-century Eastern Roman historian and a courtier of Justinian I, mentions the Western Roman Empire in his &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which primarily covers the Eastern Roman Empire from 379 to 534. In the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, it is clear that Marcellinus made a clear divide between East and West, with mentions of a geographical east (&quot;&quot;Oriens&quot;) and west (&quot;Occidens&quot;) and of an imperial east (&quot;Orientale imperium&quot; and &quot;Orientale respublica&quot;) and an imperial west (&quot;Occidentalie imperium&quot;, &quot;Occidentale regnum&quot;, &quot;Occidentalis respublica&quot;, &quot;Hesperium regnum&quot;, &quot;Hesperium imperium&quot; and &quot;principatum Occidentis&quot;&quot;). Furthermore, Marcellinus specifically designates some emperors and consuls as being &quot;Eastern&quot;, &quot;&quot;Orientalibus principibus&quot; and &quot;Orientalium consulum&quot;&quot; respectively. The term &quot;Hesperium Imperium&quot;, translating to &quot;Western Empire&quot;, has sometimes been applied to the Western Roman Empire by modern historians as well.

Though Marcellinus does not refer to the Empire as a whole after 395, only to its separate parts, he clearly identifies the term &quot;Roman&quot; as applying to the Empire as a whole. When using terms such as &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our generals&quot;, and &quot;our emperor&quot;, Marcellinus distinguished both divisions of the Empire from outside foes such as the Sasanian Persians and the Huns. This view is consistent with the view that contemporary Romans of the 4th and 5th centuries continued to consider the Empire as a single unit, although more often than not with two rulers instead of one. The first time the Empire was divided geographically was during the reign of Diocletian, but there was precedent for multiple emperors. Before Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, there had been a number of periods where there were co-emperors, such as with Caracalla and Geta in 210–211, who inherited the imperial throne from their father Septimius Severus, but Caracalla ruled alone after the murder of his brother.

===Attempted restorations of a Western court===
The positions of Eastern and Western &quot;Augustus&quot;, established under Emperor Diocletian in 286 as the Tetrarchy, had been abolished by Emperor Zeno in 480 following the loss of direct control over the western territories. Declaring himself the sole &quot;Augustus&quot;, Zeno only exercised true control over the largely intact Eastern Empire and over Italy as the nominal overlord of Odoacer. The reconquests under Justinian I would bring back large formerly Western Roman territories into Imperial control, and with them the Empire would begin to face the same problems it had faced under previous periods prior to the Tetrarchy when there had been only one ruler. Shortly after the reconquest of North Africa a usurper, Stotzas, appeared in the province (though he was quickly defeated). As such, the idea of dividing the Empire into two courts out of administrative necessity would see a limited revival during the period that the Eastern Empire controlled large parts of the former West, both by courtiers in the East and enemies in the West.

The earliest attempt at crowning a new Western emperor after the abolition of the title occurred already during the Gothic Wars under Justinian. Belisarius, an accomplished general who had already successfully campaigned to restore Roman control over North Africa and large parts of Italy, including Rome itself, was offered the position of Western Roman emperor by the Ostrogoths during his siege of Ravenna (the Ostrogothic, and previously Western Roman, capital) in 540. The Ostrogoths, desperate to avoid losing their control of Italy, offered the title and their fealty to Belisarius as Western &quot;Augustus&quot;. Justinian had expected to rule over a restored Roman Empire alone, with the &quot;Codex Justinianeus&quot; explicitly designating the new Praetorian Prefect of Africa as the subject of Justinian in Constantinople. Belisarius, loyal to Justinian, feigned acceptance of the title to enter the city, whereupon he immediately relinquished it. Despite Belisarius relinquishing the title, the offer had made Justinian suspicious and Belisarius was ordered to return east.

At the end of Emperor Tiberius II&#x27;s reign in 582, the Eastern Roman Empire retained control over relatively large parts of the regions reconquered under Justinian. Tiberius chose two &quot;Caesares&quot;, the general Maurice and the governor Germanus, and married his two daughters to them. Germanus had clear connections to the western provinces, and Maurice to the eastern provinces. It is possible that Tiberius was planning to divide the empire into western and eastern administrative units once more. If so, the plan was never realized. At the death of Tiberius, Maurice inherited the entire empire as Germanus had refused the throne. Maurice established a new type of administrative unit, the Exarchate, and organized the remaining western territories under his control into the Exarchate of Ravenna and the Exarchate of Africa.

===Later claims to the Imperial title in the West===
In addition to remaining as a concept for an administrative unit in the remaining Empire, the ideal of the Roman Empire as a mighty Christian Empire with a single ruler further continued to appeal to many powerful rulers in western Europe. With the papal coronation of Charlemagne as &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot; in AD 800, his realm was explicitly proclaimed as a restoration of the Roman Empire in Western Europe under the concept of &quot;translatio imperii&quot;. Though the Carolingian Empire collapsed in 888 and Berengar, the last &quot;Emperor&quot; claiming succession from Charlemagne, died in 924, the concept of a papacy- and Germanic-based Roman Empire in the West would resurface in the form of the Holy Roman Empire in 962. The Holy Roman Emperors would uphold the notion that they had inherited the supreme power and prestige of the Roman emperors of old until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.

Charlemagne, and the subsequent Holy Roman Emperors, were not, and did not claim to be, rulers of a restored Western Roman Empire. Pope Leo III and contemporary historians were fully aware that the notion of a separate Western court had been abolished over three centuries prior and considered the Roman Empire to be &quot;one and indivisible&quot;. The ruler of the Roman Empire at the time of Charlemagne&#x27;s coronation was Irene of Athens, the mother of emperor Constantine VI who she had deposed. Leo III considered Irene to be a usurper and illegitimate to rule due to her gender and as such considered the imperial throne to be vacant. Thus, Charlemagne was not crowned as the ruler of the Western Roman Empire and successor to Romulus Augustulus, but rather as the successor of Constantine VI and as sole Roman Emperor. Irene was deposed and replaced by Emperor Nikephoros soon after, and the Eastern Empire refused to recognize the Imperial title of Charlemagne. Following several wars in the 810s Emperor Michael I Rangabe eventually recognized Charlemagne as an &quot;Emperor&quot;, but as the slightly humiliating &quot;Emperor of the Franks&quot; rather than &quot;Roman Emperor&quot;, a title he reserved for himself. For centuries to come, the &quot;revived&quot; Western court and the Eastern court, in direct succession to the Roman emperors of old, would make competing claims to be rulers of the whole Roman Empire. With the Eastern Empire terming the Holy Roman Empire as an &quot;Empire of the Franks&quot;, the term &quot;Empire of the Greeks&quot; was popularized in the Frankish court as a way to refer to the Empire centered in Constantinople.

Following the end of the Eastern Roman Empire after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; became widespread among European monarchs. The Austrian Empire laid claim to be the heir of the Holy Roman Empire as Austria&#x27;s Habsburgs attempted to unite Germany under their rule. The German Empire, established in 1871, also claimed to be a successor of Rome through the lineage of the Holy Roman Empire. Both of these empires used the imperial title &quot;Kaiser&quot; (derived from the Latin word &quot;Caesar&quot;), the German word for emperor. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary, successor of the Austrian Empire, would both fall in the aftermath of the First World War along with the Russian and Ottoman Empires which had also claimed succession from the Eastern Roman Empire.

== List of Western Roman emperors==

With junior colleagues and heirs are listed below the reign of each emperor.

===Tetrarchy (286–313)===
* Maximian: 286–305
** Constantius I: 293–305
Maximian was elevated to &quot;caesar&quot; by Diocletian in 285, after Diocletian defeated Carinus. He became Western emperor in 286, with the establishment of the Tetrarchy. On 1 May 305, both Maximian and Diocletian abdicated, leaving Constantius and Galerius as emperors.
* Constantius I: 305–306
** Severus II: 305–306
Constantius was elevated to &quot;caesar&quot; in 293, under Maximian. Constantius became the Western emperor in 305, after the abdication of Maximian. Constantius died on 25 July 306, leaving a highly contested succession in his wake.
* Severus II: 306–307
** Constantine I: 306–307
Valerius Severus was elevated to &quot;caesar&quot; by Constantius in 305, after the abdication of Maximian and Diocletian. After the death of Constantius in 306, Severus became Western emperor. Severus was forced to deal with the revolt of Maxentius, the son of Maximian. Maxentius invaded in early 307, and captured the Western Empire. He had Severus put to death soon after his capture.
* Maxentius: 306–312
** Maximian: 306–308 
Maxentius was proclaimed emperor in 306, in opposition to Valerius Severus, and ruled alongside his father Maximian. They succeeded in capturing the Western Empire in 307, and had Severus killed soon after. The Western Empire was invaded in 312 by Constantine, who on 28 October 312 decisively defeated Maxentius, who drowned when his forces were pushed back into the Tiber river. Maximian had relinquished the title of &quot;augustus&quot; in 308, but rebelled in Gaul once again in 310. He was defeated by Constantine shortly after.
* Licinius: 308–313
** Valens I: 317 
** Martinian: 324 
Licinius was made emperor of the Eastern Empire, and parts of the Western Empire, all of which was actually held by Maxentius, at the Council of Carnuntum, which was held in 308 in order to try to end the civil war in the Western Empire. Constantine invaded Licinius&#x27; section of the Western Empire in 313, and forced him to sign a treaty in which he forfeited his claim to the Western Empire, and only controlled the Eastern Empire. Licinius attempted twice to replace Constantine, first with Valerius Valens in 316 and then Martinian in 324, but they were both killed shortly after their elevation.

===Constantinian dynasty (309–363)===

* Constantine I: 306–337 .
** Crispus: 317–326
Constantine I was proclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; of the Western Empire by his father&#x27;s troops on 25 July 306 and was accepted as &quot;caesar&quot; by Galerius later that year. In 307 Maximian accepted him to &quot;augustus&quot; (although Maximian himself was considered an usurper) and in 309 he proclaimed himself as the Western emperor, in opposition to Maxentius and Licinius. He ruled alone in the West from 312 and became sole Roman emperor following the defeat of Licinius at the Battle of Chrysopolis. 
* Constantine II 337–340 .
Constantine II was proclaimed &quot;caesar&quot; of the Eastern Empire in late 317. In 335, Constantine I allotted the inheritance his sons would receive after his death, which would take place two years later in 337, giving Constantine II the Praetorian prefecture of Gaul, which also included Britannia and Hispania. Constantine II&#x27;s relationship with Constans I was tense, and in 340, Constantine took advantage of Constans absence from Italy and invaded it. However, in the same year, he was ambushed by Constans&#x27; forces in Aquilea, and was killed.
* Constans I 337–350 .
Constans was given the Praetorian prefecture of Italy and Africa on the death of Constantine I. After Constantine II was killed in 340, while attempting to invade Constans&#x27; territory in Italy, Constans took control of the entire Western Empire. Constans was contemptuous of his army, who as a result proclaimed Magnentius as emperor in 350. Constans fled toward Hispania, but was captured and executed by an agent of Magnentius on the border.

* Magnentius 350–353 
** Vetranio: 350 
** Nepotianus: 350 

Magnentius was defeated by Constantius II at the Battle of Mursa Major in 351, but continued to rule Italy and Gaul until his final defeat at the Battle of Mons Seleucus.
* Constantius II 351–361 .
** Constantius Gallus: 351–354
** Julian: 355–361
Constantius II was proclaimed &quot;caesar&quot; in 334, and became Eastern emperor in 337, after the death of Constantine I. After Constans was killed by the usurper Magnentius, Constantius laid claim to the Western Empire, and after defeating Magnentius took possession of it, becoming sole emperor. Constantius II died in 361, of a violent fever.
* Julian: 361–363 .
Julian was proclaimed &quot;caesar&quot; in 355. He was proclaimed emperor by his troops shortly before Constantius&#x27; death. Julian died in March 363, of wounds sustained during the Battle of Samarra.

===Non-dynastic (363–364)===
* Jovian: 363–364 .

When Julian died in 363, he left no heir, causing a succession crisis. The Roman Army elected Jovian as sole emperor. Jovian reigned only seven months, in which he signed a humiliating peace treaty with the Sasanian Empire, under Shapur II. In this agreement, Rome surrendered five provinces and 18 fortresses to the Sasanians, in exchange for a 30-year truce. Jovian died on 16 February 364, due to either indigestion or charcoal vapour inhalation.

===Valentinianic dynasty (364–392)===

* Valentinian I: 364–375
** Gratian: 367–375

After the death of Jovian, Valentinian I was elected. He divided the Empire between himself and his younger brother, Valens, giving himself the West and Valens the East. Valentinian spent much of his reign defending Gaul against repeated attacks by barbarian tribes, only leaving the region in 373. In 375, while meeting with the Quadi, he suffered a stroke brought on by rage.
* Gratian: 375–383
** Valentinian II: 375–383

Valentinian I elevated his son, Gratian, to &quot;augustus&quot; in 367, however after his death in 375 his leading generals elevated his much younger son, Valentinian II, to &quot;augustus&quot; alongside Gratian and Valens who was emperor in the East. Gratian showed a strong preference for the barbarian mercenaries in his army, especially his Alanic guard, which inflamed the Roman population, to the point that in 383, Roman troops in Britain declared Magnus Maximus emperor, in opposition to Gratian. Maximus landed troops in Gaul, and attacked Gratian&#x27;s troops near Paris. Gratian was defeated, and fled to Lyons, where he was murdered on 25 August 383.
* Valentinian II: 383–392

After the death of Gratian, Valentinian II succeeded him, although he only controlled Italy itself, with all other Western Roman provinces recognizing Maximus. In 387 Maximus invaded Italy, to depose Valentinian. Valentinian fled to the court of Theodosius, where he succeeded in convincing Theodosius to attack Maximus, and to reinstate himself as Western emperor, which was done after Maximus was defeated in battle near Aquileia. Valentinian continued to rule the Western Empire until 392, when he was probably murdered by Arbogast.
* Magnus Maximus: 383–388
** Victor: 383/384–388
Magnus Maximus was elected emperor by his men in 383, in opposition to Gratian, and defeated him in battle in 383. Maximus was recognized as the Western emperor by Eastern emperor Theodosius I in 384, however this recognition was revoked by him when Maximus invaded Italy and deposed Valentinian II in 387. Valentinian II fled to the Eastern Roman Empire, and convinced Theodosius I to invade the Western Roman Empire and restore him to the Western Roman throne, which he did in 388. Maximus was defeated in battle near Aquileia, and executed.

===Theodosian dynasty (392–455)===

* Theodosius I: 394–395 

Theodosius was proclaimed Eastern Emperor by Gratian on 19 January 379, after securing victory against invading barbarians along the Danube. He became sole emperor in August 394, after defeating the usurper Eugenius. Theodosius died of edema in January 395.
* Honorius: 395–423
** Constantine III: 409–411 
*** Constans II: 409–411 
** Priscus Attalus: 409–410 
** Constantius III: 421
Honorius became Western emperor in 395, after the death of his father Theodosius. His reign was beset by barbarian invasions, and for much of his early reign, until 408, he was controlled by Stilicho, whose influence over Honorius would create a standard for puppet Western Emperors. After 408 his reign was greatly influenced by the general Constantius, who briefly reigned as his co-emperor for a few months before dying of natural causes. He also faced the usurpation of Priscus Attalus, a senator who was proclaimed emperor at Rome in 409, and Constantine, who took over Britain and Gaul around the same time. Honorius died of edema in 423.

* Joannes: 423–425 

Valentinian III was designated Honorius&#x27; heir in 421, although he was not proclaimed &quot;caesar&quot;, only given the title of &quot;nobilissimus puer&quot;. In 423, after the death of Honorius, a usurper named Joannes rose up, forcing Valentinian III to flee with his family to the court of the Eastern emperor Theodosius II. Joannes was defeated by Theodosius in Ravenna. 
* Valentinian III: 425–455
Valentinian III was killed on 16 March 455, by Optila, a friend of Aetius, whom Valentinian had killed.

===Non-dynastic (455–480)===
The following last emperors of the West were all accepted by the Senate but only two of them (Anthemius and Julius Nepos) were recognized in the East. In fact, these two emperors were installed by the Eastern emperor. 

* Petronius Maximus: 455 

Petronius Maximus became the Western Roman emperor on 17 March 455, after assassinating Valentinian III. During his short reign, he provoked Gaiseric, the Vandal king, into invading the Western Empire and sacking Rome, by breaking a marriage agreement made between Gaiseric and Valentinian III. Maximus and his son Palladius attempted to flee on 31 May 455, however they were apprehended by a group of peasants, and either killed by them, or by palace servants wishing to curry favor with them.
* Avitus: 455–456 
Avitus was proclaimed Western emperor on 9July 455, with the support of the Visigoth King Theodoric II. While he held support from the Visigoths, his rule alienated both the Roman Senate and people. In 456 Ricimer, a senior officer, had Avitus deposed, and ruled the Western Empire through a series of puppet emperors until his death in 472.
* Majorian: 457–461 
Majorian was proclaimed Western emperor on 28 December 457. On 7August 461, Majorian was compelled to abdicate, and reportedly died five days later of dysentery, although modern historians have asserted he was likely murdered by Ricimer, who became the power behind the throne.
* Libius Severus: 461–465 
Libius Severus was proclaimed Western emperor on 19 November 461. His rule, even as a puppet emperor, extended little beyond Italy, with Aegidius splitting off from the Western Empire, and establishing the Kingdom of Soissons. Libius Severus incited the hostility of the Vandals, who invaded Italy and Sicily. During these events, Libius Severus died on 14November 465, possibly due to being poisoned by Ricimer.
* Anthemius: 467–472
Anthemius was proclaimed Western emperor on 12April 467 by Leo I. Under Anthemius, the Western Empire, which had become increasingly isolated from the Eastern Empire, grew closer, although this collaboration came too late to save the Western Empire. Anthemius&#x27; friendly attitude towards the Eastern Empire angered Ricimer, who deposed him in March or April of 472.
* Olybrius: 472 

Olybrius was proclaimed emperor in April 472. His brief reign, lasting only five or six months, was dominated by Gundobad, who had replaced his uncle Ricimer as the true power behind the throne, after the former&#x27;s death. Olybrius died in October or November 472, of edema.
* Glycerius: 473–474 
After the death of both Olybrius and Ricimer, Glycerius was proclaimed Western emperor by the Western Roman army, on 3 or 5May 473. He was deposed by Julius Nepos in July 474, and sent to live in a monastery, where he remained until his death.
* Julius Nepos: 474–475 

The Eastern Roman Empire had rejected the coronation of both Olybrius and Glycerius, instead supporting Julius Nepos, &quot;magister militum&quot; in Dalmatia as Western Roman emperor. Nepos, with support from the East, deposed Glycerius in the spring of 474. Orestes, &quot;magister militum&quot; of Nepos, deposed him a year later in 475, forcing Nepos to flee Ravenna to his estates in Dalmatia. Orestes crowned his son Romulus as Western emperor, though the Eastern Empire and the Western possessions outside of Italy maintained recognition of Nepos as the legitimate Emperor. Nepos continued to rule as &quot;Western emperor&quot; in exile in Dalmatia until his murder in 480 and would be the last holder of the title.
* Romulus Augustus: 475–476 

Romulus Augustus was crowned as Western emperor after his father Orestes deposed Julius Nepos. The rule of Romulus would be brief; in the autumn of 476 the &quot;foederati&quot; under the control of Odoacer rebelled when their demands for a third of the land of Italy were ignored. Orestes was captured and executed on 28August of the same year and Romulus was deposed by Odoacer a week later. Romulus was spared and allowed to live in the Castellum Lucullanum in Campania, where he might have been alive as late as AD 507.

With the deposition of Romulus Augustus by Odoacer, direct Roman control ceased to exist in Italy. Odoacer assumed control of the peninsula as a &quot;de jure&quot; representative of Western Roman emperor Nepos. With the death of Nepos in 480, the Eastern Roman emperor Zeno abolished the title and position of Western Roman emperor and assumed the role of Odoacer&#x27;s sovereign. The position of Roman emperor would never again be divided, though some new candidates for the position of Western emperor were proposed during and after the Eastern Roman re-conquests of the sixth century, such as Belisarius in 540 and Germanus in 582.

<text>Cyril Holland (born Cyril Wilde, 5 June 1885 – 9 May 1915) was the older of the two sons of Oscar Wilde and Constance Lloyd and brother to Vyvyan Holland.

==Life==
According to his brother Vyvyan Holland&#x27;s accounts in his autobiography, &quot;Son of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1954), Oscar was a devoted and loving father to his two sons. Their childhood was a relatively happy one. However, after Wilde&#x27;s well-publicized trials in Britain, conviction in 1895, and imprisonment for gross indecency, their mother Constance took their children to Europe.

She began using the surname Holland for both the boys and herself in order to protect them from public scrutiny. She relocated with the boys to Switzerland and enrolled them at Neuenheim College, an English-speaking boarding school in Heidelberg, Germany. Oscar Wilde died in 1900; neither of his sons saw him again after he went to prison. When he was released, he went to France and never lived in the UK again.

From 1899 to 1903 Cyril attended Radley College, a private school then in Berkshire. After ending school, he became a gentleman cadet at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.

Holland was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant, Royal Field Artillery, on 20 December 1905. He was promoted to lieutenant on 20 December 1908 and served in the United Kingdom for nearly three years. He was posted to India, where he served from September 1911 until 1914 with No. 9 Ammunition Column, RFA at Secunderabad. He was promoted to captain on 30 October 1914.

==Death==
When the First World War began, Captain Holland was posted to British forces on the Continent. He participated in the battle for Neuve-Chapelle, where he was killed in France by a German sniper on 9 May 1915, during the Battle of Festubert. His grave is maintained by the War Graves Commission in St Vaast Post Military Cemetery, Richebourg-l&#x27;Avoué, France.

The station was opened on 1 March 1909 as Saint-Mandé with the extension of the line from Place d&#x27;Italie to Nation. It is named after the district of Picpus and the Boulevard de Picpus. It was renamed Picpus on 1 March 1937 to avoid confusion with Saint-Mandé on Line 1. The station has the additional name of Courteline, after author Georges Courteline (1858–1929). It was the location of the &quot;Barrière de Saint-Mandé&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the 19th century.
