<text>is an athletic game that was popular in Japan during the Heian (794–1185) and Kamakura period (1185–1333). It resembles a game of keepie uppie or hacky sack. The game was popular in Kyoto, the capital, and the surrounding Kinki (Kansai region), and over time it spread from the aristocracy to the samurai class and &quot;chōnin&quot; class. Nowadays, &quot;kemari&quot; is played as a seasonal event mainly at Shinto shrines in the Kansai region, and players play in a costume called &quot;kariginu&quot; (:ja:狩衣), which was worn as everyday clothing by court nobles during the Heian period.

==History==
The earliest &quot;kemari&quot; was created under the influence of the Chinese sport &quot;cuju&quot;, which has the same kanji. It is often said that the earliest evidence of &quot;kemari&quot; is the record of 644 CE in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, but this theory is disputed. In 644, Prince Naka-no-Ōe and Nakatomi no Kamatari, who later initiated the Taika Reforms, became friends during a ball game described as &quot;打鞠&quot;, but it may have been a hockey-like ball game using a cane instead of &quot;kemari&quot;. The earliest reliable documentary evidence of the word &quot;kemari&quot; (蹴鞠) is found in a record of an annual event called &quot;Honchō gatsuryo&quot; (:ja:本朝月令) written in the middle of the Heian period. According to the records, a &quot;kemari&quot; games were played in May 701.

&quot;Kemari&quot; became popular as a game for the nobility in the late Heian period (794–1185) in the 11th century, and in the 12th century, Fujiwara no Narimichi (:ja:藤原成通) and Nanba Yorisuke (:ja:難波頼輔) gained fame as masters of &quot;kemari&quot;. Fujiwara no Narimichi had made more than 50 visits to the Kumano Hongū Taisha to pray that his &quot;kemari&quot; skills would improve, and he had performed the &quot;kemari&quot; feat known as a &quot;ushiro mari&quot; (後ろ鞠, backward ball) in front of the shrine where Susanoo was enshrined. This technique is a keepie uppie performed on the heel.

It reached its peak between the end of the 12th century and around the 13th century in the early Kamakura period (1185–1333), and &quot;kemari&quot; games were often played during the reign of Minamoto no Yoriie. This led to the establishment of a variety of new rules, equipment and techniques, and the completion of a structured art form called &quot;kemaridō&quot; (蹴鞠道). In the Kamakura period, &quot;kemari&quot; became popular among the samurai class, and in the Muromachi period (1336–1573), &quot;kemari&quot;, along with various other performing arts such as &quot;waka&quot; (Japanese poetry) and the Japanese tea ceremony, was regarded as one of the art forms that the samurai class was encouraged to master.
In the Sengoku period (1467–1615), sumo became popular and &quot;kemari&quot; declined, but in the Edo period (1683–1868) it became popular again as a game played by &quot;chōnin&quot; class in the Kinai (Kansai region).

In the past, aristocrats living in Kyoto used to play &quot;kemari&quot; as an annual event on New Year&#x27;s Day, January 4. Emperor Meiji feared that the rapid modernization of Japan would lead to the loss of various traditional Japanese cultures, and in 1903, an association was established to preserve &quot;kemari&quot; by contributing an imperial grant. Today, &quot;kemari&quot; is performed as a seasonal event in Shinto shrines around the Kansai region such as Shimogamo Shrine, Shiramine Jingū, Fujimori Shrine (:ja:藤森神社), Tanzan Shrine, Hirano Shrine and Kotohira-gū. Seidaimyōjin (精大明神), enshrined as one of the sessha (auxiliary shrine) of Shiramine Shrine, is the kami of the &quot;mari&quot; (&quot;kemari&quot; ball) and is therefore respected by players of various ball games, mainly association football.

George H. W. Bush played the game on one of his presidential visits to Japan.

==Description==

It is a non-competitive sport. The object of Kemari is to keep one ball in the air, with all players cooperating to do so. Players may use any body part with the exception of arms and hands: their head, feet, knees, back, and depending on the rules, elbows to keep the ball aloft. The ball, known as a &quot;mari&quot;, is made of deerskin with the hair facing inside and the hide on the outside. The ball is stuffed with barley grains to give it shape. When the hide has set in this shape, the grains are removed from the ball, and it is then sewn together using the skin of a horse. The one who kicks the ball is called a &quot;mariashi.&quot; A good mariashi makes it easy for the receiver to control the mari, and serves it with a soft touch to make it easy to keep the mari in the air.

&quot;Kemari&quot; is played on a flat ground, about 6–7 meters squared. The uniforms that the modern players wear are reminiscent of the clothes of the Heian period and include a crow hat. This type of clothing was called &quot;kariginu&quot; (:ja:狩衣) and it was fashionable at that time.

<doc id="493465" wikidata="Q220305" url="?curid=493465" title="North American plate">
<text>The North American plate is a tectonic plate containing most of North America, Cuba, the Bahamas, extreme northeastern Asia, and parts of Iceland and the Azores. With an area of , it is the Earth&#x27;s second largest tectonic plate, behind the Pacific plate (which borders the plate to the west).

It extends eastward to the seismically active Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the Azores triple junction plate boundary where it meets the Eurasian plate and Nubian plate.
and westward to the Chersky Range in eastern Siberia. The plate includes both continental and oceanic crust. The interior of the main continental landmass includes an extensive granitic core called a craton. Along most of the edges of this craton are fragments of crustal material called terranes, which are accreted to the craton by tectonic actions over a long span of time. Much of North America west of the Rocky Mountains is composed of such terranes.

==Boundaries==
The southern boundary with the Cocos plate to the west and the Caribbean plate to the east is a transform fault, represented by the Swan Islands Transform Fault under the Caribbean Sea and the Motagua Fault through Guatemala. The parallel Septentrional and Enriquillo–Plantain Garden faults running through Hispaniola and bounding the Gonâve microplate, and the parallel Puerto Rico Trench running north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and bounding the Puerto Rico–Virgin Islands microplate, are also a part of the boundary. The rest of the southerly margin which extends east to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and marks the boundary between the North American plate and the South American plate is vague but located near the Fifteen-Twenty fracture zone around 16°N.

On the northerly boundary is a continuation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge called the Gakkel Ridge. The rest of the boundary in the far northwestern part of the plate extends into Siberia. This boundary continues from the end of the Gakkel Ridge as the Laptev Sea Rift, on to a transitional deformation zone in the Chersky Range, then the Ulakhan Fault between it and the Okhotsk microplate, and finally the Aleutian Trench to the end of the Queen Charlotte Fault system (see also: Aleutian Arc).

The westerly boundary is the Queen Charlotte Fault running offshore along the coast of Alaska and the Cascadia subduction zone to the north, the San Andreas Fault through California, the East Pacific Rise in the Gulf of California, and the Middle America Trench to the south.

On its western edge, the Farallon plate has been subducting under the North American plate since the Jurassic period. The Farallon plate has almost completely subducted beneath the western portion of the North American plate, leaving that part of the North American plate in contact with the Pacific plate as the San Andreas Fault. The Juan de Fuca, Explorer, Gorda, Rivera, Cocos and Nazca plates are remnants of the Farallon plate. The boundary along the Gulf of California is complex. The gulf is underlain by the Gulf of California Rift Zone, a series of rift basins and transform fault segments from the northern end of the East Pacific Rise in the mouth of the gulf to the San Andreas Fault system in the vicinity of the Salton Trough rift/Brawley seismic zone. It is generally accepted that a piece of the North American plate was broken off and transported north as the East Pacific Rise propagated northward, creating the Gulf of California. However, it is as yet unclear whether the oceanic crust between the rise and the mainland coast of Mexico is actually a new plate beginning to converge with the North American plate, consistent with the standard model of rift zone spreading centers generally.

Two major islands of the Azores, Flores and Corvo, lie on the eastern edge of the North American plate, just west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and near the Azores triple junction. The other major islands of the Azores lie on the African or Eurasian plates.

==Hotspots==
A few hotspots are thought to exist below the North American plate. The most notable hotspots are the Yellowstone (Wyoming), Jemez Lineament (New Mexico), and Anahim (British Columbia) hotspots. These are thought to be caused by a narrow stream of hot mantle convecting up from the Earth&#x27;s core–mantle boundary called a mantle plume, although some geologists think that upper mantle convection is a more likely cause. The Yellowstone and Anahim hotspots are thought to have first arrived during the Miocene period and are still geologically active, creating earthquakes and volcanoes. The Yellowstone hotspot is most notable for the Yellowstone Caldera and the many calderas that lie in the Snake River Plain, while the Anahim hotspot is most notable for the Anahim Volcanic Belt in the Nazko Cone area.

==Plate motion==
For the most part, the North American plate moves in roughly a southwest direction away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at a rate of about 2.3 centimeters (~1 inch) per year. At the same time, the Pacific plate is moving to the northwest at a speed of between 7 and 11 centimeters (~3-4 inches) per year. The motion of the plate cannot be driven by subduction as no part of the North American plate is being subducted, except for a small section comprising part of the Puerto Rico Trench; thus other mechanisms continue to be investigated. One study in 2007 suggests that a mantle convective current is propelling the plate.

<text>Live Box is a set of 4 live CDs, a live DVD and a 36-page booklet by Icelandic musician Björk, released in August 2003. Each live CD roughly corresponds to one album in her (at the time of release) four album solo discography. The 4 live CDs were later released separately in June 2004

==Background==
When Björk was pregnant with her daughter Ísadóra in 2002 she decided to start sorting through the hundreds of hours of live recordings she had collected from her tours. Assisted in the process by the head of Smekkleysa, Ásmundur Jónsson, they decided on the best performances from each of the tours to include on the live albums. This release of live material was initially confirmed by the inclusion of live tracks on the &quot;It&#x27;s in Our Hands&quot; single in 2002, credited to the &quot;Forthcoming album &quot;Vespertine Live&quot;&quot;. This was followed by an announcement in 2003 of a distribution-deal with US record company Navarre that would include &quot;both CDs and DVDs&quot;. Björk&#x27;s official website later confirmed the release of a box set containing live recordings, not only from &quot;Vespertine&quot; but from the past ten years of Björk&#x27;s solo career. Björk only started to have soundboard recordings of her live shows from the Homogenic tour onwards, so the first two discs (&quot;Debut Live&quot; and &quot;Post Live&quot;) are made up primarily of the audio from the corresponding live DVDs. Shortly before the official release, a free download of &quot;Hyperballad&quot; from the &quot;Post Live&quot; disc was made available on the Abercrombie Vintage website. The originally announced track listing for &quot;Post Live&quot; included 18 tracks (the final version has 13), and so would have included nearly the full audio from the &quot;Live at Shepherds Bush Empire&quot; DVD, from which the album takes most of its material.

The box set also includes a 36-page booklet featuring numerous photos and an in-depth conversation with Björk and Ásmundur in Björk&#x27;s home, discussing her career, her recordings and her live tours. The box set was originally announced as a limited release of 30,000 copies, although it is still available for purchase. The individual live discs were later released separately in May 2004.

==Artwork==
The artwork was designed by M/M Paris, whom Björk has worked extensively with since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Volumen&quot; release. At the time of release many online stores displayed an incorrect earlier version of the artwork for the box set, which features alternate artwork for the &quot;Post Live&quot; and &quot;Homogenic Live&quot; albums. For the album artwork of each live album, Björk herself found a selection of different photos available on the Internet. Due to the low resolution of the image chosen for &quot;Homogenic Live&quot;, it appears pixelated on the album cover.

==&quot;Live Book&quot;==
To accompany the release of the &quot;Live Box&quot;, a separate book was released titled &quot;Live Book&quot;. This features the interview with Ásmundur Jónsson that is also included in the 36-page booklet that comes with the &quot;Live Box&quot;, but also new interviews with Lynn Fox, Zeena Parkins, Matmos and Leila, who were all involved in Björk&#x27;s 2003 tour. Although now largely out of print, the book is still available for purchase at the official Björk online store.

<text>Oddar Meanchey (, UNGEGN: &quot;Ŏttâr Méanchoăy&quot;, ALA-LC: &quot;Uttar Mānjăy&quot; ; ) is a province of Cambodia in the remote northwest. It borders the provinces of Banteay Meanchey to the west, Siem Reap to the south and Preah Vihear to the east. Its long northern boundary demarcates part of Cambodia&#x27;s international border with Thailand. The capital is Samraong.

The province was created on 27 April 1999, after being carved from the northern half of Siem Reap province and part of Banteay Meanchey. It existed as a province already from 1962 to 1970 under Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s Sangkum regime, but later became an administrative no-man&#x27;s-land, with its status alternating between a province and a district under successive regimes.

==Etymology==
&quot;Oddar Meanchey&quot; means &#x27;victorious North&#x27;. The province&#x27;s name is of Sanskrit origin through Pali and is derived from the words &quot;uttarā&quot; (उत्तर), meaning &#x27;north&#x27;, and &quot;jaya&quot; (जय) which means &#x27;victory&#x27;. Khmer &quot;Mean&quot; (មាន) means &#x27;to have&#x27;.

==Administrative divisions==
The province is subdivided into 1 municipality (&quot;krong&quot;) and 4 districts (&quot;srok&quot;), and further subdivided into 19 communes (&quot;khum&quot;) and 5 quarters (&quot;sangkat&quot;).

==Ecology==
This province is in the Dângrêk Mountains. There is a serious problem of deforestation in the area. However, the first community-based mosaic REDD+ project in Asia was awarded Verified Carbon Standard and Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard validation for its forest conservation work in the province.

Forest fires are common in the dry forest and there is much illegal logging as a result of economic land concessions and migrant forest encroachment.

==History==
The mountainous and forested area that now makes up Oddar Meanchey province was part of Siamese province of Monthon Isan from 1795 to 1907 under the supervision of Sangkha. After the neighboring Thai province of Inner Cambodia and Oddar Meanchey were returned to Cambodia in 1907, King Sisowath split the province into Battambang and Siem Reap (Oddar Meanchey was included with Siem Reap). Following the Franco-Thai War from 1941 to 1946 the province was under Siamese administration as Phibunsongkhram province. The province was returned to Cambodian rule in 1946 following French diplomatic efforts at the end of World War II. The province was officially organized in 1966. During the Cambodian Civil War, the remote area was used as a base by the Khmer Rouge when they fought against the Khmer Republic led by general Lon Nol.

The Khmer Rouge of Democratic Kampuchea led by Pol Pot (&quot;Saloth Sar&quot;) and Khieu Samphan rebuilt their former jungle bases in the Dangrek mountain range area, along the border with Thailand and made Anlong Veng their base from 1989 till 1997. Oddar Meanchey province is one of the most landmine-ridden areas in Cambodia.

<text>Pursat (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: , ; meaning &quot;Floating Banyan&quot;) is a province of Cambodia. It is in the western part of the country and borders clockwise from the north: Battambang province, the Tonlé Sap, Kampong Chhnang province, Kampong Speu province, Koh Kong province, and East Thailand. It lies between the Tonle Sap and the northern end of the Cardamom Mountains. The Pursat River bisects the province, running from the Cardamoms in the west to the Tonle Sap in the east.

The fourth largest province of Cambodia in area, Pursat ranks only 14th in population. The region is accessible by National Highway 5, by boat, rail and by numerous smaller roads. The capital, Pursat town, lies 174 kilometres north west of capital Phnom Penh by road and 106 kilometres south east of Battambang.

Pursat is home to Wat Bakan, considered to be among the oldest active pagodas in Cambodia and revered as one of the most holy sites of Cambodian Buddhism. The province also hosts the annual River Run Race, an event that includes 5 km and 10 km races that generally follow the path of the Pursat River for men and women, including those requiring wheelchairs. Since its inaugural race in 2007, the event has grown to the second largest of its kind in Cambodia

==Etymology==

&quot;Pursat&quot; is derived from the transliteration of its name in Khmer script &quot;Poŭthĭsăt&quot; () means &quot;floating banyan&quot; in Khmer. It&#x27;s composed of &quot;Poŭthĭ-&quot; (, ), a Khmer word derived from the Sanskrit and Pali word of the tree named &quot;bodhi&quot; (), which is where the Buddha became enlightened, and &quot;-săt&quot; (, ) which comes from the Khmer word &quot;rôsăt&quot; (, ) meaning &quot;to float&quot;.

==Geography==
The physical geography of Pursat encompasses many bioregions ranging from densely forested mountains to fertile plains to the Tonle Sap basin. Forests cover approximately 58% of Pursat. The mountains of the Cardamom range rise high in the west and southwest of the province along the border with Thailand and the coast. The land slopes toward the northeast, opening into the plains that continue into Battambang and from which much of Cambodia&#x27;s rice crop is harvested. The Pursat River follows this orientation and drains into the Tonle Sap which forms Pursat&#x27;s eastern boundary. Pursat is one of the nine provinces that are part of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve.

==Religion==
The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 96.9% of the people in Pursat are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years. A small percentage follow Christianity.

== Economy==
===Thmada===
Chinese investors have disbursed close to 10 billion baht to develop a new city in Thmada, a border village in Veal Veang District in the province. The new town is to be built in five phases, and about 80% of the first phase, 1,000 condominiums, has been built as of 2019, together with a luxury hotel, restaurants, casinos, and other businesses. The project is to be completed by 2022 or 2025.

===Agarwood===
Due to the geography and climate of Pursat, &quot;Aquilaria&quot; thrives in its forest. Aquilaria species, specifically &quot;Aquilaria crassna&quot;, infected with the parasitic mold &quot;Phaeoacremonium parasitica&quot; are the source of agarwood. There was an abundance in wild agarwood in the past. Due to its distinct fragrance, the trees were sought after and felled for gift offerings to the royal family and officials.

Agarwood harvested from Pursat was the most valuable and highly in demand. In the early-1970s, &quot;oud Cambodi&quot; was the most sought after oud oil on the market because of the belief that it contains a psychoactive substance that affects the mind and emotions.

The depletion of wild trees from rampant cutting of agarwood has resulted in the trees being listed and protected as an endangered species. Projects are being implemented to infect cultivated &quot;Aquilaria&quot; trees artificially, to produce agarwood in a sustainable manner.

In 2015, Lieutenant General Ouk Kosa of Cambodia&#x27;s Ministry of National Defense signed an MOU with a Singaporean company, giving the company access to six million mature Aquilaria trees, which they will inoculate to produce agarwood.

==Administrative divisions==
The province is divided into six districts and one municipality, further divided into 51 communes.

<doc id="493480" wikidata="Q14691920" url="?curid=493480" title="Elohim City, Oklahoma">
<text>Elohim City (also known as Elohim City Inc. and Elohim Village) is a private community in Adair County, Oklahoma, United States. The rural retreat was founded in 1973 by Robert G. Millar, a Canadian immigrant, former Mennonite, and &quot;one of the most important leaders&quot; in America&#x27;s Christian Identity movement, a theology common to an assortment of right-wing extremist groups. The community gained national attention for its ties to members of The Order in the 1980s, as well as with convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in the 1990s.

The enclave consists of approximately one dozen structures, some of them mobile homes and others modernistic dome houses. The center of activity is the church-community center, where residents meet for hour-long sessions each morning.

Robert G. Millar died on May 28, 2001. After his death, his second-oldest son, John Millar, became the leader of Elohim City. John Millar died on February 28, 2019.

==History==

Robert G. Millar emigrated in the 1950s from Kitchener, Ontario to Oklahoma City, where he established a church. In the mid-1960s, Millar moved to Maryland, where he ran an evangelical camp near Ellicott City. This camp was located in Howard County on Frederick Road about one mile (1.6 km) west of US Route 29, at the former location of St. Charles College, a Catholic minor seminary destroyed by fire in 1911.

In 1973, Millar returned to Oklahoma with around 18 followers, some of whom were related to him by birth or marriage, to found Elohim City.

===Criminal events===
In 1986, a Canadian woman and her children sought refuge in the city, contravening a court order awarding custody of the children to her husband. Officers attempting to arrest the woman were met by an armed man.

By the mid-1990s, four members of the Aryan Republican Army (Michael William Brescia, Kevin McCarthy, Scott Stedeford, and Mark Thomas) were residents of Elohim City. Brescia was engaged to Millar&#x27;s step-granddaughter and stayed in the city for almost two years. Between 1994 and 1995, these four, together with other members of the ARA (known by the media as the &quot;Midwest Bank Robbers&quot;), were responsible for a series of 22 bank robberies totaling over $250,000 in the American Midwest, which they used to finance white supremacist causes. Millar denied any knowledge of the robberies. 

It is believed that the ARA may have also recruited members at Elohim City and/or may have sent recruits to Elohim City for &quot;re-education.&quot; Reports also indicate that Elohim City may have provided ARA with training grounds and assisted them in distributing monies received from other groups.
The Mueller family, who were brief residents of Elohim City, reportedly left the compound in fear they would be assassinated by the ARA. The Muellers were supposedly privy to information connecting the ARA to the Oklahoma City bombing. Soon after, the Mueller family were tortured and assassinated by Chevie Kehoe and Daniel Lewis Lee under the direction of the ARA.

The remains of former Elohim City guest Richard Snell were released to Elohim City residents following his April 19, 1995 execution in Arkansas. Snell taunted jailers that something drastic would happen on the day of his execution. The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed by explosives in the hours before he died. Earlier criminal proceedings had produced evidence that Snell and other affiliates visited the Murrah Building in 1983 to examine it as a possible bombing target. 

However, when Snell watched televised reports of the Oklahoma City bombing prior to his execution, according to Millar, who was with Snell at the time, Snell was appalled by what he saw. This contrasts with reports that he was seen nodding in agreement while watching the broadcast. McVeigh is known to have telephoned Elohim City two weeks before the bombing of the Murrah building.

In 2008 an Adair County man, who had been evicted from Elohim City, was charged with threatening to commit violence against several Elohim City residents. He was acquitted in 2009, following a two-day jury trial in which he represented himself.

By 2023, Elohim was seen locally as only a small religious town in spite of its past associations.

==Customs and ideology==
The town is run by a board of directors whose members are called &quot;elders&quot;. The residents believe in and advocate white supremacism. Polygamy was acceptable at one time.

In an interview with &quot;The Oklahoman&quot;, Millar asserted that if anyone, including government agents, were to come to Elohim City to commit criminal acts, the community would defend itself.

==Income==
According to Robert Millar, Elohim City operates a small sawmill and trucking enterprise on its property. Millar&#x27;s son, Bruce, owns a fleet of motor-freight rigs that he leases to National Carriers Inc., a hauling company that transports general commodities and hazardous materials.

==Religion==
Elohim City&#x27;s particular brand of faith draws heavily from the Old Testament. The community&#x27;s residents attend daily religious services, and singing and dancing play a large role in the ceremonies. Religious services are held in a meeting center with a domed roof made of polyurethane. An estimated 60% of the community&#x27;s residents attend these daily 1-2 hour meetings, where they also make announcements or discuss community and family business. Saturday is the community&#x27;s day of rest.

Robert G. Miller declared that the CSA leader James Ellison was a &quot;prophet full of vision&quot; who would unite the attending groups so they could do battle with the so-called Zionist Occupied Government.

==Law enforcement investigations==
The US government has monitored the private community since the 1980s due to its alliance with various white supremacist groups and members of the Aryan Nations.

Prior to July 1995, FBI informant Richard Schrum was sent to infiltrate Elohim City, but he was unable to find anything illegal on the compound.

Sometime before the Oklahoma City bombing, federal officials had planned to raid Elohim City. As a precaution, police scanners were monitored by the community and spotters were on the lookout to advise them of approaching suspect vehicular traffic. During this time, Millar also noted an increase in flights over Elohim City.
===Alleged illegal activities===
An unnamed source, disclosed in a 1995 FBI report, has stated that Elohim City received approximately 96 yards of concrete that had been transported via 122 truckloads from a local concrete company. While the anonymous individual was uncertain of what the purpose of the concrete was, additional sources have indicated the existence of bunkers and weapon storage facilities on the Elohim City compound. 

This same FBI document noted that a number of sources alleged the community was generating income through the sale of illegal drugs, which were allegedly produced and grown on the compound. Similarly, Author David Hoffman claims in his 1998 book &quot;The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror&quot; that at one time, law enforcement officials had received reports that the compound was believed to be generating income through the sale of illegal drugs. He adds that an unnamed source &quot;familiar with the community&quot; had told him about an incident when resident Bruce Millar (a son of Robert Millar) was supposedly &quot;strung out&quot; on methamphetamine.

==Population==
The total population of Elohim City is unknown, but was estimated in the 1990s to be between 70 and 90.

In 2015, it was estimated that there were about 100 residents, most of them descendants of Robert Millar.

===Millar family===
Robert Millar had a total of eight children. His four sons all live at Elohim City.
* Dorcas Millar - The wife of John Millar.
* Lorraine Allen Millar - the late wife of Elohim City&#x27;s founder, Robert Millar.

===Other residents===
Other individuals who either stayed or lived at Elohim City (some of whom later appeared in national news) include:

* Rokus den Hartog, Millar&#x27;s protégé who (along with his wife and seven daughters) lived on the compound for a couple of years in the 1980s. 
* George Eaton, founder of Present Truth Ministries and publisher/editor of a right-wing, anti-Semitic newsletter called &quot;The Patriot Report,&quot; of which Timothy McVeigh was a known subscriber.
* James Ellison, white supremacist leader of The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord.
* Michael J. Fortier, an army buddy of Timothy McVeigh&#x27;s, who was imprisoned for failing to warn authorities of the Oklahoma City bombing.
* Carol Howe, ATF informant who worked undercover in Elohim City.
* Chevie Kehoe, a self-proclaimed white supremacist and convicted murderer.
* Willie Ray Lampley, a self-proclaimed prophet, leader of the now-defunct Oklahoma Constitutional Militia and the head of the Universal Church of God (Yahweh). For unknown reasons, Lampley had planned to test a homemade bomb at Elohim City, but was thwarted by the FBI. He was also friends with Robert Millar as the two were both firm believers of Christian Identity.
* Faron Earl Lovelace, convicted in a separate case of murdering a man he believed was a federal informant.
* Dennis Mahon, a former imperial dragon in the Oklahoma Ku Klux Klan and an organizer for White Aryan Resistance.
* Kerry Noble, the second-in-command of The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord. He was part of the plot to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in 1983.
* Zera Patterson IV
* Andreas Strassmeir, German immigrant, head of Elohim City security, phoned by Timothy McVeigh two weeks before the OKC bombing.
* Pete Ward Jr.

<text>10,000 (ten thousand) is the natural number following 9,999 and preceding 10,001.

==Name==
Many languages have a specific word for this number: in Ancient Greek it is (the etymological root of the word myriad in English), in Aramaic , in Hebrew [], in Chinese (Mandarin , Cantonese , Hokkien &quot;bān&quot;), in Japanese [], in Khmer [], in Korean [], in Russian [], in Vietnamese , in Sanskrit अयुत [&quot;ayuta&quot;], in Thai [], in Malayalam [], and in Malagasy &quot;alina&quot;. In many of these languages, it often denotes a very large but indefinite number.

The classical Greeks used letters of the Greek alphabet to represent Greek numerals: they used a capital letter mu (Μ) to represent ten thousand. This Greek root was used in early versions of the metric system in the form of the decimal prefix myria-.

Depending on the country, the number ten thousand is usually written as 10,000 (including in the UK and US), 10.000, or 10 000.

==In mathematics==
In scientific notation, it is written as 104 or 1 E+4 (equivalently 1 E4) in E notation. It is the square of 100 and the square root of 100,000,000.

The value of a myriad to the power of itself, 1000010000 = 1040000.

It has a total of 25 divisors, whose geometric mean is a whole number, 100 (the number of primes below this value is 25).

It has a reduced totient of 500, and a totient of 4,000, with a total of 16 integers having a totient value of 10,000.

There are a total of 1,229 prime numbers less than ten thousand, a count that is itself prime. 
A myriagon is a polygon with ten thousand edges and a total of 25 dihedral symmetry groups when including the myriagon itself, alongside 25 cyclic groups as subgroups.

<doc id="493500" wikidata="Q856788" url="?curid=493500" title="Prey Veng province">
<text>Prey Veng ( ; ) is a province (&quot;khaet&quot;) of Cambodia. The capital is Prey Veng. With a population of 1.1 million people, it is the third most populous province.

This densely populated agricultural region is located on the east bank of the Mekong. The name literally means &quot;long forest&quot; in khmer, but the last great forests have gradually disappeared there over 30-year to provide for agricultural land.

==History==

In early Christian era, the province was a major center of the kingdom of Funan, between economic and political capitals of the country what were Oc Eo (now in the Vietnamese province of An Giang) and Angkor Borei (in the Cambodian province of Takéo province).

However, with the advent of Chen-la, the hub of the kingdom moved farther west, to Koh Ker and Angkor and the region lost its importance.

In the 15th century, the Khmer emperors, under threat from the Siamese (former name of people of current Thailand) decided to resettle back to the east, to Oudong, Lovek then Phnom Penh. Prey Veng did not favor them as it was too close to another danger, namely the Annam. Nevertheless, they formed an army at Ba Phnom in 1473 to defend against an invasion of Siam.

Under the French protectorate, the colonial authorities saw potential of the region in terms of agriculture and fishing and its proximity to the French colony of Cochin China. Mass deforestation took place, to create land for agriculture.

In 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took power, the province experienced its first famine, until 1977. Thousands of people in Prey Veng province were killed by the Khmer Rouge and buried in mass graves.

As the Vietnamese army advanced in January 1979, the region regained its position and became one of the first areas of Cambodia liberated from the Khmer Rouge.

==Geography==
The province is bordered by those of Kampong Cham to the northwest, Tbong Khmum to the northeast, Kandal to the west, and Svay Rieng to the east and by Vietnam (Đồng Tháp, Long An and Tây Ninh) or Kampuchea Krom (Phsar Dek, Kampong Kho and Rong Domrey) to the south. It is crossed by two major rivers of the country, namely the Mekong and Tonle Bassac.

The total land area of the province is 4,883 km2, which equals 2.7% of the total land area of Cambodia (181,035 km2). This consists of 445.18 km2 or 9.12% of human settlements, 3,100 km2 or 63.49% of agricultural land use, 194.61 km2 or 3.99% of forested area, 1,082.86 km2 or 22.18% of public land, infrastructure and water bodies. The remaining 60.35 km2 or 1.24% are unused areas.

==Population==
The total population is 947,357 persons or 7.07% of the total population of 13,388,910 persons in Cambodia In the above number are also consisting of 825,818 person or 80.54% are farmers, 140,685 person or 13.72% are fishermen, 44,561 person or 4,35% are traders, 14,267 person or 1.39% are government&#x27;s officers. The average density 194.0 person per km2.

The majority of the population is of Khmer origin and only 1.13% are from ethnic minorities such as Kinh (Viet), the Muslim Chams or Laos.

==Economy==
The province boasts of silt deposited in each flood, this makes the region conducive to agriculture and fishing. It is part of what is called the &quot;great green belt&quot; of Cambodia.

The main crop of rice and has the largest area devoted to rice in the country, contributing about 10% in the national crop and is among those that emerge each year the largest surplus. Tobacco, mung beans, cane sugar, palm sugar, cassava, sesame and fruits such as coconuts, mangoes and cashews are grown in Prey Veng. Rubber trees have played an important economic role in the past, but the plantations were abandoned during the wars that bloodied the country decades ago.

==Districts==
The province contains 1139 villages organized by 116 communes and 12 districts and 1 municipality. The districts are:

==Religion==
The state religion is Theravada Buddhism. More than 99.5% of the people in Prevy Veng are Buddhists. Chams have been practicing Islam for hundreds of years. A small percentage follow Christianity.

==Tourist Sites==

===Ba Phnom===
Ba Phnom is located 78 kilometers east of Phnom Penh and 45 kilometres south of the provincial capital. Its name literally means &quot;ancestor of the hill&quot;. There is actually a mound of 139 meters.

Archaeological research has shown that it was an important cultural center of the kingdom of Fu-Nan, and a sacred place in which they worshipped Shiva. The site seems to have retained its sacred character throughout the Angkor period, and traces of animist and Buddhist rituals have also been found.

===Prey Veng===
The provincial capital is located on the National Road 11 between Neak Leung and Kampong Cham. It is located about 2 and half hours by road from Phnom Penh and 3 hours from Ho Chi Minh City. This quaint town is off the usual tourist trail and is uncrowded. It houses several old dilapidated colonial homes. There is a large lake west of the city which is dry from March to August.

<text>Ratanakiri (, UNGEGN: &quot;Rôtânôkĭri&quot;, ALA-LC: &quot;Ratanagirī&quot; ; ) is a province of northeast Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Mondulkiri to the south and Stung Treng to the west and the countries of Laos (Attapeu in Khmer Language is Ach Krapeu) and Vietnam (Gia Lai and Kon Tum) to the north and east, respectively. The province extends from the mountains of the Annamite Range in the north, across a hilly plateau between the Tonlé San and Tonlé Srepok rivers, to tropical deciduous forests in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have scarred Ratanakiri&#x27;s environment, long known for its beauty.

For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland Khmer Loeu people, who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the region&#x27;s early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as slaves by neighboring empires. The slave trade economy ended during the French colonial era, but a harsh Khmerization campaign after Cambodia&#x27;s independence again threatened Khmer Loeu ways of life. The Khmer Rouge built its headquarters in the province in the 1960s, and bombing during the Vietnam War devastated the region. Today, rapid development in the province is altering traditional ways of life.

Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 184,000 residents make up just over 1% of the country&#x27;s total population. Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence shifting agriculture. Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men&#x27;s life expectancy is 39 years, and women&#x27;s is 43 years. Education levels are also low, with just under half of the population illiterate.

==History==
Ratanakiri has been occupied since at least the Stone or Bronze Age, and trade between the region&#x27;s highlanders and towns along the Gulf of Thailand dates to at least the 4th century A.D. The region was invaded by Annamites, the Cham, the Khmer, and the Thai during its early history, but no empire ever brought the area under centralized control. From the 13th century or earlier until the 19th century, highland villages were often raided by Khmer, Lao, and Thai slave traders. The region was conquered by local Laotian rulers in the 18th century and then by the Thai in the 19th century. The area was incorporated into French Indochina in 1893, and colonial rule replaced slave trading. The French built huge rubber plantations, especially in Labansiek (present-day Banlung); indigenous workers were used for construction and rubber harvesting. While under French control, the land comprising present-day Ratanakiri was transferred from Siam (Thailand) to Laos and then to Cambodia. Although highland groups initially resisted their colonial rulers, by the end of the colonial era in 1953 they had been subdued.

Ratanakiri Province was created in 1959 from land that had been the eastern area of Stung Treng Province. The name &quot;Ratanakiri&quot; (រតនគិរី) is formed from the Khmer words រតនៈ (&quot;rôtânô&quot; &quot;gem&quot; from Sanskrit &quot;ratna&quot;) and គិរី (&quot;kĭri&quot; &quot;mountain&quot; from Sanskrit &quot;giri&quot;), describing two features for which the province is known. During the 1950s and 1960s, Norodom Sihanouk instituted a development and Khmerization campaign in northeast Cambodia that was designed to bring villages under government control, limit the influence of insurgents in the area, and &quot;modernize&quot; indigenous communities. Some Khmer Loeu were forcibly moved to the lowlands to be educated in Khmer language and culture, ethnic Khmer from elsewhere in Cambodia were moved into the province, and roads and large rubber plantations were built. After facing harsh working conditions and sometimes involuntary labor on the plantations, many Khmer Loeu left their traditional homes and moved farther from provincial towns. In 1968, tensions led to an uprising by the Brao people in which several Khmer were killed. The government responded harshly, torching settlements and killing hundreds of villagers.
In the 1960s, the ascendant Khmer Rouge forged an alliance with ethnic minorities in Ratanakiri, exploiting Khmer Loeu resentment of the central government. The Communist Party of Kampuchea headquarters was moved to Ratanakiri in 1966, and hundreds of Khmer Loeu joined CPK units. During this period, there was also extensive Vietnamese activity in Ratanakiri. Vietnamese communists had operated in Ratanakiri since the 1940s; at a June 1969 press conference, Sihanouk said that Ratanakiri was &quot;practically North Vietnamese territory&quot;. Between March 1969 and May 1970, the United States undertook a massive covert bombing campaign in the region, aiming to disrupt sanctuaries for communist Vietnamese troops. Villagers were forced outside of main towns to escape the bombings, foraging for food and living on the run with the Khmer Rouge. In June 1970, the central government withdrew its troops from Ratanakiri, abandoning the area to Khmer Rouge control. The Khmer Rouge regime, which had not initially been harsh in Ratanakiri, became increasingly oppressive. The Khmer Loeu were forbidden from speaking their native languages or practicing their traditional customs and religion, which were seen as incompatible with communism. Communal living became compulsory, and the province&#x27;s few schools were closed. Purges of ethnic minorities increased in frequency, and thousands of refugees fled to Vietnam and Laos. Preliminary studies indicate that bodies accounting for approximately 5% of Ratanakiri&#x27;s residents were deposited in mass graves, a significantly lower rate than elsewhere in Cambodia.

After the Vietnamese defeated the Khmer Rouge in 1979, government policy toward Ratanakiri became one of benign neglect. The Khmer Loeu were permitted to return to their traditional livelihoods, but the government provided little infrastructure in the province. Under the Vietnamese, there was little contact between the provincial government and many local communities. Long after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, however, Khmer Rouge rebels remained in the forests of Ratanakiri. Rebels largely surrendered their arms in the 1990s, though attacks along provincial roads continued until 2002.

Ratanakiri&#x27;s recent history has been characterized by development and attendant challenges to traditional ways of life. The national government has built roads, encouraged tourism and agriculture, and facilitated rapid immigration of lowland Khmers into Ratanakiri. Road improvements and political stability have increased land prices, and land alienation in Ratanakiri has been a major problem. Despite a 2001 law allowing indigenous communities to obtain collective title to traditional lands, some villages have been left nearly landless. The national government has granted concessions over land traditionally possessed by Ratanakiri&#x27;s indigenous peoples, and even land &quot;sales&quot; have often involved bribes to officials, coercion, threats, or misinformation. Following the involvement of several international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), land alienation had decreased in frequency as of 2006. In the 2000s, Ratanakiri also received hundreds of Degar (Montagnard) refugees fleeing unrest in neighboring Vietnam; the Cambodian government was criticized for its forcible repatriation of many refugees.

==Geography and climate==

The geography of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland watersheds, and crater lakes. Two major rivers, Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, flow from east to west across the province. The province is known for its lush forests; as of 1997, 70–80% of the province was forested, either with old-growth forest or with secondary forest regrown after shifting cultivation. In the far north of the province are mountains of the Annamite Range; the area is characterized by dense broadleaf evergreen forests, relatively poor soil, and abundant wildlife. In the highlands between Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, the home of the vast majority of Ratanakiri&#x27;s population, a hilly basalt plateau provides fertile red soils. Secondary forests dominate this region. South of the Srepok River is a flat area of tropical deciduous forests.

Like other areas of Cambodia, Ratanakiri has a monsoonal climate with a rainy season from June to October, a cool season from November to January, and a hot season from March to May. Ratanakiri tends to be cooler than elsewhere in Cambodia. The average daily high temperature in the province is , and the average daily low temperature is . Annual precipitation is approximately . Flooding often occurs during the rainy season and has been exacerbated by the recently built Yali Falls Dam.
Ratanakiri has some of the most biologically diverse lowland tropical rainforest and montane forest ecosystems in mainland Southeast Asia. One 1996 survey of two sites in Ratanakiri and one site in neighboring Mondulkiri recorded 44 mammal species, 76 bird species, and 9 reptile species. A 2007 survey of Ratanakiri&#x27;s Virachey National Park recorded 30 ant species, 19 katydid species, 37 fish species, 35 reptile species, 26 amphibian species, and 15 mammal species, including several species never before observed. Wildlife in Ratanakiri includes Asian elephants, gaur, and monkeys. Ratanakiri is an important site for the conservation of endangered birds, including the giant ibis and the greater adjutant. The province&#x27;s forests contain a wide variety of flora; one half-hectare forest inventory identified 189 species of trees and 320 species of ground flora and saplings.

Nearly half of Ratanakiri has been set aside in protected areas, which include Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary and Virachey National Park. Even these protected areas, however, are subject to illegal logging, poaching, and mineral extraction. Though the province has been known for its relatively pristine environment, recent development has spawned environmental problems. The unspoiled image of the province often conflicts with the reality on the ground: visitors &quot;expecting to find pristine forests teeming with wildlife are increasingly disappointed to find lifeless patches of freshly cut tree stumps&quot;. Land use patterns are changing as population growth has accelerated and agriculture and logging have intensified. Soil erosion is increasing, and microclimates are being altered. Habitat loss and unsustainable hunting have contributed to the province&#x27;s decreasing biodiversity.

==Government and administrative divisions==
Government in Ratanakiri is weak, largely due to the province&#x27;s remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal framework is poor, and the rule of law is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.

Thon Saron is the provincial governor. As of the 2017 communal elections, commune councils in Ratanakiri are composed of 207 members representing the CPP, 51 members representing the Cambodia National Rescue Party, and two members representing the Grassroots Democracy Party. Political scientist Caroline Hughes has suggested that the CPP&#x27;s overwhelming dominance in rural areas such as Ratanakiri stems from the central government&#x27;s ability to suppress collective action, which in urban areas is offset by international donors and NGOs that provide support for opposition parties. Fifty-one commune council members in Ratanakiri (20%) were women as of the 2012 communal elections, and 98% of Ratanakiri&#x27;s government staff was Khmer as of 2006. Bou Lam, a member of the CPP, represents Ratanakiri in the National Assembly of Cambodia.

Village government in Ratanakiri has both traditional and administrative components. Traditional forms of government, namely village elders and other indigenous institutions, are dominant. Members of each village designate one or more community elders to manage village affairs, mediate conflicts, and ensure that villagers follow customary laws, particularly about land and resource use. Elders do not play an autocratic role, and are instead primarily respected advisors and consensus builders. Village elders are generally male, but women also play a role in the management of the community and its resources. A village may also have a village chief, i.e., a local government person who is appointed by a higher governmental official. The village chief serves as a liaison between the village and outside government officials, but lacks traditional authority. The role of the village chief in village governance may be poorly defined; in one Kreung village, residents told a researcher that they were &quot;very unclear exactly what the work of the village chief entailed.&quot;

The province is divided into eight districts and one municipality, further divided into 50 communes, as follows:

==Economy and transportation==
The vast majority of workers in Ratanakiri are employed in agriculture. Most of the indigenous residents of Ratanakiri are subsistence farmers, practicing slash and burn shifting cultivation. (See Culture below for more information on traditional subsistence practices.) Many families are beginning to shift production to cash crops such as cashews, mangoes, and tobacco, a trend that has accelerated in recent years. Ratanakiri villagers have traditionally had little contact with the cash economy. Barter exchange remains widespread, and Khmer Loeu villagers tended to visit markets only once per year until quite recently. As of 2005, monetary income in the province averaged US$5 per month per person; purchased possessions such as motorcycles, televisions, and karaoke sets have become extremely desirable.

Larger-scale agriculture occurs on rubber and cashew plantations. Other economic activities in the province include gem mining and commercial logging. The most abundant gem in Ratanakiri is blue zircon. Small quantities of amethyst, blue sapphire and Peridot are also produced. Gems are generally mined using traditional methods, with individuals digging holes and tunnels and manually removing the gems; recently, however, commercial mining operations have been moving into the province. Logging, particularly illegal logging, has been a problem both for environmental reasons and because of land alienation. In 1997, an estimated 300,000 cubic meters of logs were exported illegally from Ratanakiri to Vietnam, compared to a legal limit of 36,000 cubic meters. John Dennis, a researcher for the Asian Development Bank, described the logging in Ratanakiri as a &quot;human rights emergency&quot;.

Ratanakiri&#x27;s tourist industry has rapidly expanded in recent years: visits to the province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region&#x27;s tourism development strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents&#x27; consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.

Ox-cart and motorcycle are common means of transportation in Ratanakiri. The provincial road system is better than in some parts of the country, but remains in somewhat bad condition. National Road 78 between Banlung and the Vietnam border was built between 2007 and 2010; the road was expected to increase trade between Cambodia and Vietnam. There is a small airport in Banlung, but commercial flights to Ratanakiri have long been discontinued.

==Demographics and towns==
As of 2013, Ratanakiri Province had a population of approximately 184,000. Its population nearly doubled between 1998 and 2013, largely due to internal migration. In 2013, Ratanakiri made up 1.3% of Cambodia&#x27;s total population; its population density of 17.0 residents per square kilometer was just over one fifth the national average. About 70% of the province&#x27;s population lives in the highlands; of the other 30%, approximately half live in more urbanized towns, and half live along rivers and in the lowlands, where they practice wetland rice cultivation and engage in market activities. Banlung, the provincial capital located in the central highlands, is by far the province&#x27;s largest town, with a population of approximately 25,000. Other significant towns include Veun Sai in the north and Lomphat in the south, with populations of 2,000 and 3,000 respectively.

In 2013, 37% of Ratanakiri residents were under age 15, 52% were age 15 to 49, 7% were age 50 to 64, and 3% were aged 65 or older; 49.7% of residents were male, and 50.3% were female. Each household had an average of 4.9 members, and most households (85.6%) were headed by men.

While highland peoples have inhabited Ratanakiri for well over a millennium, lowland peoples have migrated to the province in the last 200 years. As of 2013, various highland groups collectively called Khmer Loeu made up approximately half of Ratanakiri&#x27;s population, ethnic Khmers made up 36%, and ethnic Lao made up 10%. Within the Khmer Loeu population, 35% were Tampuan as of 1996, 24% were Jarai, 23% were Kreung, 11% were Brou, 3% were Kachok, and 3% were Kavet, with other groups making up the remaining one percent. There are also very small Vietnamese, Cham, and Chinese minorities. Though the official language of Ratanakiri (like all of Cambodia) is Khmer, each indigenous group speaks its own language. Less than 10% of Ratanakiri&#x27;s indigenous population can speak Khmer fluently.

==Health, education, and development==

Health indicators in Ratanakiri are the worst in Cambodia. Life expectancy is 39 years for men and 43 years for women. Malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, cholera, diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases are endemic. Ratanakiri has very high rates of maternal and child mortality; in Ratanakiri and neighboring Mondulkiri (whose figures were combined in the most recent survey), over 10% of children die before the age of five. Ratanakiri also has the country&#x27;s highest rates of severe malnutrition. Ratanakiri residents&#x27; poor health can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poverty, remoteness of villages, poor quality medical services, and language and cultural barriers that prevent Khmer Loeu from obtaining medical care. The province has one referral hospital, 10 health centers, and 17 health posts. Medical equipment and supplies are minimal, and most health facilities are staffed by nurses or midwives, who are often poorly trained and irregularly paid.
As of 1998, Ratanakiri had 76 primary schools, one junior high school, and one high school. Education levels, particularly among Khmer Loeu, are very low. A 2002 survey of residents in six villages found that fewer than 10% of respondents had attended any primary school. Access to education is limited because of the expense of books, distance to schools, children&#x27;s need to contribute to their families&#x27; livelihood, frequent absence of teachers, and instruction that is culturally inappropriate and in a language foreign to most students. Only 55% of Ratanakiri adults were literate as of 2013 (compared to 80% in Cambodia overall). Bilingual education initiatives, in which students begin instruction in native languages and gradually transition to instruction in Khmer, began in Ratanakiri in 2002 and appear to have been successful. The programs aim to make education more accessible to speakers of indigenous languages, as well as to give Khmer Loeu access to national political and economic affairs by providing Khmer language skills.

Ratanakiri is one of the least developed provinces in Cambodia. As of 2013, the average home had 1.9 rooms, and only 14.9% of buildings in the province had permanent roofs, walls, and flooring. Relatively few households (27.8%) had toilet facilities. The largest share of households (38.0%) obtained water from springs, streams, ponds, or rain; much of the remainder obtained water from protected (23.9%) or unprotected (15.1%) dug wells. Only 21.6% of Ratanakiri residents obtained water from sources that are considered safe (purchased water, piped water, or tube/piped wells). Household water sources were within the home for 28.0% of households, near the home for 39.1%, and away from the home for 32.9%. The most common source of light was battery power (39.5%), followed by government-provided power (25.5%), and kerosene (16.5%). Most households (85%) used firewood as the main fuel for cooking. A variety of NGOs, including Oxfam and Health Unlimited, work to improve health and living conditions in the province.

==Culture==

Khmer Loeu typically practice subsistence slash and burn shifting cultivation in small villages of between 20 and 60 nuclear families. Each village collectively owns and governs a forest territory whose boundaries are known though not marked. Within this land, each family is allocated, on average, 1–2 hectares (2.5–5 acres) of actively cultivated land and 5–6 hectares (12.5–15 acres) of fallow land. The ecologically sustainable cultivation cycle practiced by the Khmer Loeu generally lasts 10 to 15 years. Villagers supplement their agricultural livelihood with low-intensity hunting, fishing, and gathering over a large area.

Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri are largely dictated by the food that is available for harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, cassava, and taro. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild game and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest. (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, jackfruit, papayas, and mangoes.
Houses in rural Ratanakiri are made from bamboo, rattan, wood, saek, and kanma leaves, all of which are collected from nearby forests; they typically last for around three years. Village spatial organization varies by ethnic group. Kreung villages are constructed in a circular manner, with houses facing inwards toward a central meeting house. In Jarai villages, vast longhouses are inhabited by all extended families, with the inner house divided into smaller compartments. Tampuan villages may follow either pattern.

Nearly all Khmer Loeu are animist, and their cosmologies are intertwined with the natural world. Some forests are believed to be inhabited by local spirits, and local taboos forbid cutting in those areas. Within spirit forests, certain natural features such as rock formations, waterfalls, pools, and vegetation are sacred. Major sacrificial festivals in Ratanakiri occur during March and April, when fields are selected and prepared for the new planting season. Christian missionaries are present in the province, and some Khmer Loeu have converted to Christianity. Indigenous community representatives have described the missionaries as a major threat to their society. The region&#x27;s ethnic Khmer are Buddhist. There is also a small Muslim community, consisting mainly of ethnic Cham.

Because of the province&#x27;s high prevalence of malaria and its distance from regional centers, Ratanakiri was isolated from Western influences until the late 20th century. Major cultural shifts have occurred in recent years however, particularly in villages near roads and district towns; these changes have been attributed to contact with internal immigrants, government officials, and NGO workers. Clothing and diets are becoming more standardized, and traditional music is being displaced by Khmer music. Many villagers have also observed a loss of respect for elders and a growing divide between the young and the old. Young people have begun to refuse to abide by traditional rules and have stopped believing in spirits.

<text>K-PAX is an American science fiction novel by Gene Brewer, the first in the &quot;K-PAX&quot; series. The series deals with the experiences on Earth of a being named Prot. It is written in the first person from the point of view of Prot&#x27;s psychiatrist.

&quot;K-PAX&quot; was adapted into a theatrical film of the same name, released in 2001.

==Series==
* &quot;K-PAX&quot; (1995)
* &quot;K-PAX II: On a Beam of Light&quot; (2001)
* &quot;K-PAX III: Worlds of Prot&quot; (2002)
* &quot;K-PAX IV: A New Visitor from the Constellation Lyra&quot; (2007)
* &quot;K-PAX V: The Coming of the Bullocks&quot; (2014)

==Synopsis==
In 1990, a man is picked up by the New York Police after being found bending over the victim of a mugging at Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan. After responding to the police questions with somewhat strange answers, he is transferred to Bellevue Hospital for evaluation. Although not physically ill, he is found to harbor the strange delusion that he is from a planet called K-PAX in the Lyra constellation. The patient calls himself &quot;prot&quot; (pronounced to rhyme with &quot;goat&quot;, and intentionally written in lower-case to reflect the insignificance of an individual life form in the universe). He is eventually transferred to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute (MPI), where he becomes the patient of Dr. Gene Brewer.

Prot is extremely fond of fruit, including banana skins and apple cores, which he eats during each session. He tells Brewer that he is 337 Earth years old, that he has visited Earth often, and that on this visit he has traveled to most of the world&#x27;s countries for the past four years and nine months. He exhibits a sense of humor, reassuring Brewer on the first session that, despite being one, an alien will not burst out of his chest. Brewer discovers that prot is also a savant who possesses arcane information about astronomy that excites a group of astronomers who meet him. Prot states that he possesses at least rudimentary conversational knowledge of most human languages as well as the languages of animals, including whale song and the apparent gibberish of some schizophrenic patients.

Though prot&#x27;s dialogue is usually satirical, he turns out to be highly suggestible and easily hypnotized. Once Brewer learns this, he begins more serious therapy. With the help of journalist Giselle Griffin, Brewer discovers that prot may be Robert Porter, who was traumatized by the murder of his wife and child, and his subsequent killing of the perpetrator, and that prot may be an alter ego resulting from dissociative identity disorder. Brewer speculates that the name prot is derived from Porter&#x27;s surname.

When prot &quot;returns&quot; to his own planet, Robert Porter is left in a catatonic state. However, Bess, another patient prot had promised to take with him, disappears along with a box of souvenirs prot has been collecting. Before departing, prot promises to return in five Earth years.

==Adaptations==
The 2001 film &quot;K-PAX&quot; was directed by Iain Softley and based on the first book in this series. Kevin Spacey portrays prot, and Jeff Bridges plays the psychiatrist.

&quot;K-PAX&quot; was made into a stage play, also written by Gene Brewer, and has been performed at the Lion and Unicorn Theatre, directed by Victor Sobchak. In 2010, the play made its North American debut at The Geneva Underground Playhouse in Geneva, Illinois directed by Eric Peter Schwartz.

==Reception==
&quot;Booklist&quot; called the novel &quot;fascinating&quot;. Psychiatrist Allan Beveridge wrote that the novel is a good example of &quot;why psychiatrists should read fiction&quot;, saying that it shows &quot;how to approach moral quandaries and decision-making&quot;. Science fiction scholar David Ketterer compares it with the novel &quot;Star-Begotten&quot; by H.G. Wells. Reviewer Michael Berry wrote &quot;There aren&#x27;t many possible denouements for a book like this, and Brewer steers a middle course between the extremes of outright fantasy and predictable mundaneness. &quot;K-PAX&quot; displays the mildly off-putting attitude found in such movies as &quot;Rain Man&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, that we all can learn so much about ourselves from the simple-minded, but one can&#x27;t deny that some of the story&#x27;s episodes are genuinely funny and touching.&quot; Reviewer Lisa Koosis wrote that Prot &quot;is one of the more extraordinary characters found in current science fiction&quot; and that the author, &quot;without actually having the characters set foot on another planet, manages to bring an alien world to life&quot;.

==Lawsuit==
Upon the release of the film version of the book, Argentinian director Eliseo Subiela claimed that &quot;K-PAX&quot; plagiarized his 1986 film &quot;Man Facing Southeast&quot;, and sued Brewer. The complaint was later withdrawn when Subiela could not afford continued litigation, but maintained his stated position on the matter until his death in late 2016. Brewer went on to release a memoir exploring his inspiration for the books, called &quot;Creating K-PAX or Are You Sure You Want to Be a Writer?&quot;

<text>Human Life International (HLI) is a Roman Catholic, U.S.-based anti-abortion organization. It is one of the largest anti-abortion organizations in the United States. It describes itself as &quot;the largest international pro-life organization in the world&quot;, saying that it has affiliates and associates in over 80 nations worldwide and has sent representatives to approximately 160. The group is led by clergy. It has been based in Front Royal, Virginia since 1996.

Human Life International was established in 1981 in Gaithersburg, Maryland by Paul Marx, as a continuation of the Human Life Center founded by Marx at Saint John&#x27;s University, Minnesota in 1972. Its mission is to train and organize anti-abortion movement leaders — priests, crisis pregnancy centers, civic leaders, radio and television programmers, and family counselors. HLI bases its activism on Catholic anti-abortion beliefs, which propose that life begins at conception. The group also advocates against contraceptives. It has supported the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda.

In the mid-1990s, Jennifer Gonnerman described HLI&#x27;s anti-abortion campaign as more influential than that of the Operation Save America. In 1997, Human Life International supported the founding of the Center for Family and Human Rights. The group is affiliated with the Population Research Institute. From 2000 to 2014, the group used $7.9 million for anti-abortion causes.

Shenan J. Boquet became president of HLI in November 2011.

In 2017, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that several US crisis pregnancy center (CPC) and anti-abortion groups including Human Life International (HLI), have been providing money and assistance to networks of CPC&#x27;s in Latin America, as well as lobbying against the liberalization of abortion laws throughout the region. HLI started their network of CPC&#x27;s in the region in the 1980&#x27;s, with the total number of locations having increased to approximately 130 CPC&#x27;s across 20 countries by 2015.

<text>The Tübinger Stift () is a hall of residence and teaching; it is owned and supported by the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg, and located in the university city of Tübingen, in South West Germany. The Stift was founded as an Augustinian monastery in the Middle Ages. After the Reformation, in 1536, Duke Ulrich turned the Stift into a seminary which served to prepare Protestant pastors for Württemberg. To this day the scholarship is still given to students in preparation for the ministry or teaching in Baden-Württemberg. Students receive a scholarship which consists of boarding, lodging and further academic support.

Some of the well known &quot;Stiftlers&quot; are the astronomer Johannes Kepler and his associate, statesman Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin who had as roommates the philosophers G. W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Schelling (although the latter was five years their junior), the theologians David Friedrich Strauß, Johann Albrecht Bengel, Friedrich Christoph Oetinger, Ferdinand Christian Baur and Eberhard Nestle, and the philologist August Pauly.

<doc id="493521" wikidata="Q1134475" url="?curid=493521" title="Flux (metallurgy)">
<text>In metallurgy, a flux is a chemical reducing agent, flowing agent, or purifying agent. Fluxes may have more than one function at a time. They are used in both extractive metallurgy and metal joining.

Some of the earliest known fluxes were sodium carbonate, potash, charcoal, coke, borax, lime, lead sulfide and certain minerals containing phosphorus. Iron ore was also used as a flux in the smelting of copper. These agents served various functions, the simplest being a reducing agent, which prevented oxides from forming on the surface of the molten metal, while others absorbed impurities into slag, which could be scraped off molten metal.

Fluxes are also used in foundries for removing impurities from molten nonferrous metals such as aluminium, or for adding desirable trace elements such as titanium.

As reducing agents, fluxes facilitate soldering, brazing, and welding by removing oxidation from the metals to be joined. In some applications molten flux also serves as a heat-transfer medium, facilitating heating of the joint by the soldering tool.

==Uses==
===Metal joining===
In high-temperature metal joining processes (welding, brazing and soldering), fluxes are nearly inert at room temperature, but become strongly reducing at elevated temperatures, preventing oxidation of the base and filler materials. The role of flux is typically dual: dissolving the oxides already present on the metal surface to facilitate wetting by molten metal, and acting as an oxygen barrier by coating the hot surface, preventing oxidation.

For example, tin-lead solder attaches very well to copper metal, but poorly to its oxides, which form quickly at soldering temperatures. By preventing the formation of metal oxides, flux enables the solder to adhere to the clean metal surface, rather than forming beads, as it would on an oxidized surface.
====Soldering====
In soldering metals, flux serves a threefold purpose: it removes any oxidized metal from the surfaces to be soldered, seals out air thus preventing further oxidation, and improves the wetting characteristics of the liquid solder. Some fluxes are corrosive, so the parts have to be cleaned with a damp sponge or other absorbent material after soldering to prevent damage. Several types of flux are used in electronics.

A number of standards exist to define the various flux types. The principal standard is J-STD-004.

Various tests, including the ROSE test, may be used after soldering to check for the presence of ionic or other contaminants that could cause short circuits or other problems.

====Brazing and silver soldering====

Brazing (sometimes known as silver soldering or hard soldering) requires a higher temperature than soft soldering (&gt; 450 °C). As well as removing existing oxides, rapid oxidation of the metal at the elevated temperatures has to be avoided. This means that fluxes need to be more aggressive and to provide a physical barrier. Traditionally borax was used as a flux for brazing, but there are now many different fluxes available, often using active chemicals such as fluorides as well as wetting agents. Many of these chemicals are toxic and due care should be taken during their use.

===Smelting===

In the process of smelting, inorganic chlorides, fluorides (see fluorite), limestone and other materials are designated as &quot;fluxes&quot; when added to the contents of a smelting furnace or a cupola for the purpose of purging the metal of chemical impurities such as phosphorus, and of rendering slag more liquid at the smelting temperature. Slag is a liquid mixture of ash, flux, and other impurities. This reduction of slag viscosity with temperature, increasing the flow of slag in smelting, is the origin of the word &quot;flux&quot; in metallurgy. 

The flux most commonly used in iron and steel furnaces is limestone, which is charged in the proper proportions with the iron and fuel.

==Drawbacks==
Fluxes have several serious drawbacks:
* Corrosivity, which is mostly due to the aggressive compounds of the activators; hygroscopic properties of the flux residues may aggravate the effects
* Interference with test equipment, which is due to the insulating residues deposited on the test contacts on electronic circuit boards
* Interference with machine vision systems when the layer of flux or its remains is too thick or improperly located
* Contamination of sensitive parts, e.g. facets of laser diodes, contacts of connectors and mechanical switches, and MEMS assemblies
* Deterioration of electrical properties of printed circuit boards, as soldering temperatures are above the glass transition temperature of the board material and flux components (e.g. glycols, or chloride and bromide ions) can diffuse into its matrix; e.g. water-soluble fluxes containing polyethylene glycol were demonstrated to have such impact
* Deterioration of high-frequency circuit performance by flux residues
* Deterioration of surface insulation resistance, which tends to be as much as three orders of magnitude lower than the bulk resistance of the material
* Electromigration and growth of whiskers between nearby traces, aided by ionic residues, surface moisture and a bias voltage
* The fumes liberated during soldering have adverse health effects, and volatile organic compounds can be outgassed during processing
* The solvents required for post-soldering cleaning of the boards are expensive and may have adverse environmental impact

In special cases the drawbacks are sufficiently serious to warrant using fluxless techniques.

===Dangers===
Acid flux types (not used in electronics) may contain hydrochloric acid, zinc chloride or ammonium chloride, which are harmful to humans. Therefore, flux should be handled with gloves and goggles, and used with adequate ventilation.

Prolonged exposure to rosin fumes released during soldering can cause occupational asthma (formerly called &quot;colophony disease&quot; in this context) in sensitive individuals, although it is not known which component of the fumes causes the problem.

While molten solder has low tendency to adhere to organic materials, molten fluxes, especially of the resin/rosin type, adhere well to fingers. A mass of hot sticky flux can transfer more heat to skin and cause more serious burns than a comparable particle of non-adhering molten metal, which can be quickly shaken off. In this regard, molten flux is similar to molten hot glue.

===Fluxless techniques===
In some cases the presence of flux is undesirable; flux traces interfere with e.g. precision optics or MEMS assemblies. Flux residues also tend to outgas in vacuum and space applications, and traces of water, ions and organic compounds may adversely affect long-term reliability of non-hermetic packages. Trapped flux residues are also the cause of most voids in the joints. Flux-less techniques are therefore desirable there.

For successful soldering and brazing, the oxide layer has to be removed from both the surfaces of the materials and the surface of the filler metal preform; the exposed surfaces also have to be protected against oxidation during heating. Flux-coated preforms can also be used to eliminate flux residue entirely from the soldering process.

Protection of the surfaces against further oxidation is relatively simple, by using vacuum or inert atmosphere. Removal of the native oxide layer is more troublesome; physical or chemical cleaning methods have to be employed and the surfaces can be protected by e.g. gold plating. The gold layer has to be sufficiently thick and non-porous to provide protection for reasonable storage time. Thick gold metallization also limits choice of soldering alloys, as tin-based solders dissolve gold and form brittle intermetallics, embrittling the joint. Thicker gold coatings are usually limited to use with indium-based solders and solders with high gold content.

Removal of the oxides from the solder preform is also troublesome. Fortunately some alloys are able to dissolve the surface oxides in their bulk when superheated by several degrees above their melting point; the Sn-Cu1 and Sn-Ag4 require superheating by 18–19 °C, the Sn-Sb5 requires as little as 10 °C, but the Sn-Pb37 alloy requires 77 °C above its melting point to dissolve its surface oxide. The self-dissolved oxide degrades the solder&#x27;s properties and increases its viscosity in molten state, however, so this approach is not optimal.

Solder preforms are preferred to be with high volume-to-surface ratio, as that limits the amount of oxide being formed. Pastes have to contain smooth spherical particles, preforms are ideally made of round wire. Problems with preforms can be also sidestepped by depositing the solder alloy directly on the surfaces of the parts or substrates, by chemical or electrochemical means for example.

A protective atmosphere with chemically reducing properties can be beneficial in some cases. Molecular hydrogen can be used to reduce surface oxides of tin and indium at temperatures above 430 and 470 °C; for zinc the temperature is above 500 °C, where zinc is already becoming volatilized. (At lower temperatures the reaction speed is too slow for practical applications.) Very low partial pressures of oxygen and water vapor have to be achieved for the reaction to proceed.

Other reactive atmospheres are also in use. Vapors of formic acid and acetic acid are the most commonly used. Carbon monoxide and halogen gases (for example carbon tetrafluoride, sulfur hexafluoride, or dichlorodifluoromethane) require fairly high temperatures for several minutes to be effective.

Atomic hydrogen is much more reactive than molecular hydrogen. In contact with surface oxides it forms hydroxides, water, or hydrogenated complexes, which are volatile at soldering temperatures. A practical dissociation method is an electrical discharge. Argon-hydrogen gas compositions with hydrogen concentration below the low flammable limit can be used, eliminating the safety issues. The operation has to be performed at low pressure, as the stability of atomic hydrogen at atmospheric pressure is insufficient. Such hydrogen plasma can be used for fluxless reflow soldering.

Active atmospheres are relatively common in furnace brazing; due to the high process temperatures the reactions are reasonably fast. The active ingredients are usually carbon monoxide (possibly in the form of combusted fuel gas) and hydrogen. Thermal dissociation of ammonia yields an inexpensive mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen.

Bombardment with atomic particle beams can remove surface layers at a rate of tens of nanometers per minute. The addition of hydrogen to the plasma augments the removal efficiency by chemical mechanisms.

Mechanical agitation is another possibility for disrupting the oxide layer. Ultrasound can be used for assisting tinning and soldering; an ultrasonic transducer can be mounted on the soldering iron, in a solder bath, or in the wave for wave soldering. The oxide disruption and removal involves cavitation effects between the molten solder and the base metal surface. A common application of ultrasound fluxing is in tinning of passive parts (active parts do not cope well with the mechanical stresses involved); even aluminium can be tinned this way. The parts can then be soldered or brazed conventionally.

Mechanical rubbing of a heated surface with molten solder can be used for coating the surface. Both surfaces to be joined can be prepared this way, then placed together and reheated. This technique was formerly used to repair small damages on aluminium aircraft skins.

A very thin layer of zinc can be used for joining aluminium parts. The parts have to be perfectly machined, or pressed together, due to the small volume of filler metal. At high temperature applied for long time, the zinc diffuses away from the joint. The resulting joint does not present a mechanical weakness and is corrosion-resistant. The technique is known as diffusion soldering.

Fluxless brazing of copper alloys can be done with self-fluxing filler metals. Such metals contain an element capable of reaction with oxygen, usually phosphorus. A good example is the family of copper-phosphorus alloys.

== Properties ==
Fluxes have several important properties:
* Activity – the ability to dissolve existing oxides on the metal surface and promote wetting with solder. Highly active fluxes are often acidic or corrosive in nature.
* Corrosivity – the promotion of corrosion by the flux and its residues. Most active fluxes tend to be corrosive at room temperatures and require careful removal. As activity and corrosivity are linked, the preparation of surfaces to be joined should allow use of milder fluxes. Some water-soluble flux residues are hygroscopic, which causes problems with electrical resistance and contributes to corrosion. Fluxes containing halides and mineral acids are highly corrosive and require thorough removal. Some fluxes, especially those based on borax used for brazing, form very hard glass-like coatings that are difficult to remove.
* Cleanability – the difficulty of removal of flux and its residues after the soldering operation. Fluxes with higher content of solids tend to leave larger amount of residues; thermal decomposition of some vehicles also leads to formation of difficult-to-clean, polymerized and possibly even charred deposits (a problem especially for hand soldering). Some flux residues are soluble in organic solvents, others in water, some in both. Some fluxes are no-clean, as they are sufficiently volatile or undergo thermal decomposition to volatile products, that they do not require the cleaning step. Other fluxes leave non-corrosive residues that can be left in place. However, flux residues can interfere with subsequent operations; they can impair adhesion of conformal coatings, or act as undesired insulation on connectors and contact pads for test equipment.
* Residue tack – the stickiness of the surface of the flux residue. When not removed, the flux residue should have smooth, hard surface. Tacky surfaces tend to accumulate dust and particulates, which causes issues with electrical resistance; the particles themselves can be conductive or they can be hygroscopic or corrosive.
* Volatility – this property has to be balanced to facilitate easy removal of solvents during the preheating phase but to not require too frequent replenishing of solvent in the process equipment.
* Viscosity – especially important for solder pastes, which have to be easy to apply but also thick enough to stay in place without spreading to undesired locations. Solder pastes may also function as a temporary adhesive for keeping electronic parts in place before and during soldering. Fluxes applied by e.g. foam require low viscosity.
* Flammability – relevant especially for glycol-based vehicles and for organic solvents. Flux vapors tend to have low autoignition temperature and present a risk of a flash fire when the flux comes in contact with a hot surface.
* Solids – the percentage of solid material in the flux. Fluxes with low solids, sometimes as little as 1–2%, are called low solids flux, low-residue flux, or no clean flux. They are often composed of weak organic acids, with addition of small amount of rosin or other resins.
* Conductivity – some fluxes remain conductive after soldering if not cleaned properly, leading to random malfunctions on circuits with high impedances. Different types of fluxes are differently prone to cause these issues.

== Composition ==
===Fluxes for metal joining===
The composition of fluxes is tailored for the required properties - the base metals and their surface preparation (which determine the composition and thickness of surface oxides), the solder (which determines the wetting properties and the soldering temperature), the corrosion resistance and ease of removal, and others.

Fluxes for soft soldering are typically of organic nature, though inorganic fluxes, usually based on halogenides or acids, are also used in non-electronics applications. Fluxes for brazing operate at significantly higher temperatures and are therefore mostly inorganic; the organic compounds tend to be of supplementary nature, e.g. to make the flux sticky at low temperature so it can be easily applied.

The surface of the tin-based solder is coated predominantly with tin oxides; even in alloys the surface layer tends to become relatively enriched by tin. Fluxes for indium and zinc based solders have different compositions than fluxes for ordinary tin-lead and tin-based solders, due to different soldering temperatures and different chemistry of the oxides involved.

Organic fluxes are unsuitable for flame soldering and flame brazing, as they tend to char and impair solder flow.

Some metals are classified as &quot;unsolderable&quot; in air, and have to be either coated with another metal before soldering or special fluxes or protective atmospheres have to be used. Such metals are beryllium, chromium, magnesium, titanium, and some aluminium alloys.

Fluxes for high-temperature soldering differ from the fluxes for use at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures even relatively mild chemicals have sufficient oxide-disrupting activity, but the metal oxidation rates become fairly high; the barrier function of the vehicle therefore becomes more important than the fluxing activity. High molecular weight hydrocarbons are often used for this application; a diluent with a lower molecular weight, boiling off during the preheat phase, is usually used to aid application.

Common fluxes are ammonium chloride or resin acids (contained in rosin) for soldering copper and tin; hydrochloric acid and zinc chloride for soldering galvanized iron (and other zinc surfaces); and borax for brazing, braze-welding ferrous metals, and forge welding.
=== Organic fluxes ===
Organic fluxes typically consist of four major components:
* Activators – chemicals disrupting/dissolving the metal oxides. Their role is to expose unoxidized, easily wettable metal surface and aid soldering by other means, e.g. by exchange reactions with the base metals.
** Highly active fluxes contain chemicals that are corrosive at room temperature. The compounds used include metal halides (most often zinc chloride or ammonium chloride), hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, and hydrobromic acid. Salts of mineral acids with amines are also used as aggressive activators. Aggressive fluxes typically facilitate corrosion, require careful removal, and are unsuitable for finer work. Activators for fluxes for soldering and brazing aluminium often contain fluorides.
** Milder activators begin to react with oxides only at elevated temperature. Typical compounds used are carboxylic acids (e.g. fatty acids (most often oleic acid and stearic acid), dicarboxylic acids) and sometimes amino acids. Some milder fluxes also contain halides or organohalides.
* Vehicles – high-temperature tolerant chemicals in the form of non-volatile liquids or solids with suitable melting point; they are generally liquid at soldering temperatures. Their role is to act as an oxygen barrier to protect the hot metal surface against oxidation, to dissolve the reaction products of activators and oxides and carry them away from the metal surface, and to facilitate heat transfer. Solid vehicles tend to be based on natural or modified rosin (mostly abietic acid, pimaric acid, and other resin acids) or natural or synthetic resins. Water-soluble organic fluxes tend to contain vehicles based on high-boiling polyols - glycols, diethylene glycol and higher polyglycols, polyglycol-based surfactants and glycerol.
* Solvents – added to facilitate processing and deposition to the joint. Solvents are typically dried out during preheating before the soldering operation; incomplete solvent removal may lead to boiling off and spattering of solder paste particles or molten solder.
* Additives – numerous other chemicals modifying the flux properties. Additives can be surfactants (especially nonionic), corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers and antioxidants, tackifiers, thickeners and other rheological modifiers (especially for solder pastes), plasticizers (especially for flux-cored solders), and dyes.

=== Inorganic fluxes ===
Inorganic fluxes contain components playing the same role as in organic fluxes. They are more often used in brazing and other high-temperature applications, where organic fluxes have insufficient thermal stability. The chemicals used often simultaneously act as both vehicles and activators; typical examples are borax, borates, fluoroborates, fluorides and chlorides. Halogenides are active at lower temperatures than borates, and are therefore used for brazing of aluminium and magnesium alloys; they are however highly corrosive.

===Behavior of activators===
The role of the activators is primarily disruption and removal of the oxide layer on the metal surface (and also the molten solder), to facilitate direct contact between the molten solder and metal. The reaction product is usually soluble or at least dispersible in the molten vehicle. The activators are usually either acids, or compounds that release acids at elevated temperature.

The general reaction of oxide removal is:
:Metal oxide + Acid → Salt + Water
Salts are ionic in nature and can cause problems from metallic leaching or dendrite growth, with possible product failure. In some cases, particularly in high-reliability applications, flux residues must be removed.

The activity of the activator generally increases with temperature, up to a certain value where activity ceases, either due to thermal decomposition or excessive volatilization. However the oxidation rate of the metals also increases with temperature.

At high temperatures, copper oxide reacts with hydrogen chloride to water-soluble and mechanically weak copper chloride, and with rosin to salts of copper and abietic acid which is soluble in molten rosin.

Some activators may also contain metal ions, capable of exchange reaction with the underlying metal; such fluxes aid soldering by chemically depositing a thin layer of easier solderable metal on the exposed base metal. An example is the group of fluxes containing zinc, tin or cadmium compounds, usually chlorides, sometimes fluorides or fluoroborates.

=== Inorganic activators ===

Common high-activity activators are mineral acids, often together with halides, amines, water or alcohols:
* hydrochloric acid, most common
* phosphoric acid, less common, use limited by its polymerization at higher temperatures

Inorganic acids are highly corrosive to metals even at room temperature, which causes issues during storage, handling and applications. As soldering involves high temperatures, compounds that decompose or react, with acids as products, are frequently used:
* zinc chloride, which at high temperatures reacts with moisture, forming oxychloride and hydrochloric acid
* ammonium chloride, thermally decomposing to ammonia and hydrochloric acid
* amine hydrochlorides, decomposing to the amine and hydrochloric acid

==Rosin fluxes==

The terms resin flux and rosin flux are ambiguous and somewhat interchangeable, with different vendors using different assignments. Generally, fluxes are labeled as rosin if the vehicle they are based on is primarily natural rosin. Some manufactures reserve &quot;rosin&quot; designation for military fluxes based on rosin (R, RMA and RA compositions) and label others as &quot;resin&quot;.

Rosin has good flux properties. A mixture of organic acids (resin acids, predominantly abietic acid, with pimaric acid, isopimaric acid, neoabietic acid, dihydroabietic acid, and dehydroabietic acid), rosin is a glassy solid, virtually nonreactive and noncorrosive at normal temperature, but liquid, ionic and mildly reactive to metal oxides at molten state. Rosin tends to soften between 60–70 °C and is fully fluid at around 120 °C; molten rosin is weakly acidic and is able to dissolve thinner layers of surface oxides from copper without further additives. For heavier surface contamination or improved process speed, additional activators can be added.

There are several possible activator groups for rosins:
* halide activators (organic halide salts, e.g. dimethylammonium chloride and diethylammonium chloride)
* organic acids (monocarboxylic, e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and dicarboxylic, e.g. oxalic acid, malonic acid, sebacic acid)

There are three types of rosin: gum rosin (from pine tree oleoresin), wood rosin (obtained by extraction of tree stumps), and tall oil rosin (obtained from tall oil, a byproduct of kraft paper process). Gum rosin has a milder odor and lower tendency to crystallize from solutions than wood rosin, and is therefore preferred for flux applications. Tall oil rosin finds increased use due to its higher thermal stability and therefore lower tendency to form insoluble thermal decomposition residues. The composition and quality of rosin differs by the tree type, and also by location and even by year. In Europe, rosin for fluxes is usually obtained from a specific type of Portuguese pine; in America a North Carolina variant is used.

Natural rosin can be used as is, or can be chemically modified by e.g. esterification, polymerization, or hydrogenation. The properties being altered are increased thermal stability, better cleanability, altered solution viscosity, and harder residue (or conversely, softer and more tacky residue). Rosin can be also converted to a water-soluble rosin flux, by formation of an ethoxylated rosin amine, an adduct with a polyglycol and an amine.

One of the early fluxes was a mixture of equal amounts of rosin and vaseline. A more aggressive early composition was a mixture of saturated solution of zinc chloride, alcohol, and glycerol.

Fluxes can be also prepared from synthetic resins, often based on esters of polyols and fatty acids. Such resins have improved fume odor and lower residue tack, but their fluxing activity and solubility tend to be lower than that of natural resins.

===Rosin flux grades===

Rosin fluxes are categorized by grades of activity: L for low, M for moderate, and H for high. There are also other abbreviations for different rosin flux grades:
* R (Rosin) – pure rosin, no activators, low activity, mildest
* WW (water-white) – purest rosin grade, no activators, low activity, sometimes synonymous with R
* RMA (rosin mildly activated) - contains mild activators, typically no halides
* RA (rosin activated) – rosin with strong activators, high activity, contains halides
* OA (organic acid) – rosin activated with organic acids, high activity, highly corrosive, aqueous cleaning
* SA (synthetically activated) – rosin with strong synthetic activators, high activity; formulated to be easily soluble in organic solvents (chlorofluorocarbons, alcohols) to facilitate cleaning
* WS (water-soluble) – usually based on inorganic or organic halides; highly corrosive residues
* SRA (superactivated rosin) – rosin with very strong activators, very high activity
* IA (inorganic acid) – rosin activated with inorganic acids (usually hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid), highest activities, highly corrosive

R, WW, and RMA grades are used for joints that can not be easily cleaned or where there is too high corrosion risk. More active grades require thorough cleaning of the residues. Improper cleaning can actually aggravate the corrosion by releasing trapped activators from the flux residues.

==Special fluxes==
===Fluxes for soldering certain metals===
Some materials are very difficult to solder. In some cases special fluxes have to be employed.
====Aluminum and its alloys====
Aluminium and its alloys are difficult to solder due to the formation of the passivation layer of aluminium oxide. The flux has to be able to disrupt this layer and facilitate wetting by solder. Salts or organic complexes of some metals can be used; the salt has to be able to penetrate the cracks in the oxide layer. The metal ions, more noble than aluminium, then undergo a redox reaction, dissolve the surface layer of aluminium and form a deposit there. This intermediate layer of another metal then can be wetted with a solder.

One example of such flux is a composition of triethanolamine, fluoroboric acid, and cadmium fluoroborate. More than 1% magnesium in the alloy impairs the flux action, however, as the magnesium oxide layer is more refractory. Another possibility is an inorganic flux composed of zinc chloride or tin(II) chloride, ammonium chloride, and a fluoride (e.g. sodium fluoride). Presence of silicon in the alloy impairs the flux effectivity, as silicon does not undergo the exchange reaction aluminium does.

====Magnesium alloys====
Magnesium alloys. A putative flux for soldering these alloys at low temperature is molten acetamide. Acetamide dissolves surface oxides on both aluminium and magnesium; promising experiments were done with its use as a flux for a tin-indium solder on magnesium.

====Stainless steel====
Stainless steel is a material which is difficult to solder because of its stable, self-healing surface oxide layer and its low thermal conductivity. A solution of zinc chloride in hydrochloric acid is a common flux for stainless steels; it has however to be thoroughly removed afterwards as it would cause pitting corrosion. Another highly effective flux is phosphoric acid; its tendency to polymerize at higher temperatures however limits its applications.

===Metal salts as flux in hot corrosion===
Hot corrosion can affect gas turbines operating in high salt environments (e.g., near the ocean). Salts, including chlorides and sulfates, are ingested by the turbines and deposited in the hot sections of the engine; other elements present in fuels also form salts, e.g. vanadates. The heat from the engine melts these salts which then can flux the passivating oxide layers on the metal components of the engine, allowing corrosion to occur at an accelerated rate.

==List of fluxes==

* Borax – for brazing

==Flux recovery==
During the submerged arc welding process, not all flux turns into slag. Depending on the welding process, 50% to 90% of the flux can be reused.

==Standards==
Solder fluxes are specified according to several standards.

===ISO 9454-1 and DIN EN 29454-1===

The most common standard in Europe is ISO 9454-1 (also known as DIN EN 29454-1).

This standard specifies each flux by a four-character code: flux type, base, activator, and form. The form is often omitted.

Therefore, 1.1.2 means rosin flux with halides.

===DIN 8511===

The older German DIN 8511 specification is still often in use in shops. In the table below, note that the correspondence between DIN 8511 and ISO 9454-1 codes is not one-to-one.

===J-STD-004===

One standard increasingly used (e.g. in the United States) is J-STD-004. It is very similar to DIN EN 61190-1-1.

Four characters (two letters, then one letter, and last a number) represent flux composition, flux activity, and whether activators include halides:

* First two letters: Base
** RO: rosin
** RE: resin
** OR: organic
** IN: inorganic
* Third letter: Activity
** L: low
** M: moderate
** H: high
* Number: Halide content
** 0: less than 0.05% in weight (“halide-free”)
** 1: halide content depends on activity:
*** less than 0.5% for low activity
*** 0.5% to 2.0% for moderate activity
*** greater than 2.0% for high activity

Any combination is possible, e.g. ROL0, REM1 or ORH0.

J-STD-004 characterizes the flux by reliability of residue from a surface insulation resistance (SIR) and electromigration standpoint. It includes tests for electromigration and surface insulation resistance (which must be greater than 100 MΩ after 168 hours at elevated temperature and humidity with a DC bias applied).

===MIL-F-14256 and QQ-S-571===

The old MIL-F-14256 and QQ-S-571 standards defined fluxes as:
*R (rosin)
*RMA (rosin mildly activated)
*RA (rosin activated)
*WS (water-soluble)

Any of these categories may be no-clean, or not, depending on the chemistry selected and the standard that the manufacturer requires.

<doc id="493525" wikidata="Q4874616" url="?curid=493525" title="Baylor University basketball scandal">
<text>The Baylor University basketball scandal occurred in the early 2000s, when Baylor University&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball program was investigated and punished for numerous infractions by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The scandal broke out after the 2003 murder of Baylor basketball player Patrick Dennehy. Dennehy&#x27;s teammate Carlton Dotson pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to a 35-year prison term.

Shortly after Dennehy&#x27;s initial disappearance, Baylor and the NCAA began investigations into multiple allegations, ranging from drug use among players to improper payments to players by the coaching staff. Baylor self-imposed punishments, which the NCAA augmented to include extended probation for the school through 2010, the elimination of one year of non-conference play, and a ten-year show-cause penalty on resigned head coach Dave Bliss. The sanctions so crippled the basketball program that they didn&#x27;t have another winning season until 2008. It is one of the harshest penalties ever imposed on a Division I program that didn&#x27;t include the NCAA&#x27;s &quot;death penalty&quot;.

==Disappearance and murder of Patrick Dennehy==

Patrick Dennehy was a junior forward who transferred to Baylor University following his sophomore season at the University of New Mexico (UNM) in 2001–2002. In the summer of 2003, Dennehy and his new teammate Carlton Dotson indicated that they were concerned about their safety. After both men failed to attend a party, there were indications that something had gone wrong when Dennehy&#x27;s family had not heard from him and Dennehy&#x27;s roommate returned home to find that his dog had not been fed. On June 25, Dennehy&#x27;s car was found in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with its license plates removed.

An affidavit filed on June 23, which was unsealed on June 30, which sought a search warrant for Dennehy&#x27;s computer reported that an informant in Delaware told police that Dotson, who was by now at home in Hurlock, Maryland, told a cousin that he had shot and killed Dennehy during an argument while firing guns in the Waco, Texas area. On July 21, Dotson was charged with Dennehy&#x27;s murder and taken into custody in Maryland. On July 26, a badly decomposed body was found in a gravel pit near Waco and was later identified as Dennehy. On July 30, his death was ruled a homicide, and on August 7, a memorial service was held for Dennehy in San Jose, California.

Following a stint in which Dotson&#x27;s competency to stand trial was in question, he pleaded guilty to the murder on June 8, 2005, and was sentenced a week later to 35 years in prison. Dotson is currently an inmate of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and will be eligible for parole after he has served about half of his sentence.

==NCAA violations==
In early August 2003, allegations arose concerning Dennehy&#x27;s ability to remain with the Baylor basketball team during the 2002–2003 academic year without an athletic scholarship. Allegations of impropriety within Baylor&#x27;s athletic department surfaced and university president Robert B. Sloan appointed an investigative panel to determine if there were any potential violations of National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) rules at the school.

===Improper payments to players===
Having reached the limits on team scholarships, Baylor head coach Dave Bliss had surreptitiously paid Dennehy&#x27;s tuition and that of teammate Corey Herring. Herring and his family had no knowledge of this; he was under the impression that he was on scholarship. During the investigations, Bliss publicly claimed Dennehy had paid his tuition by being a drug dealer, but was soon under investigation by the university and the NCAA. Additionally, in the weeks preceding his resignation, Bliss flew to New York City—without the knowledge of anyone, including his wife—in an attempt to convince Herring&#x27;s mother to lie about paying $18,641. Later, Bliss pretended to be Herring&#x27;s father—in an attempt to determine what evidence school and NCAA investigators might find against him—when he called Baylor&#x27;s financial aid office to check on payments made to Herring&#x27;s account.

===Drug use===
On August 1, further allegations arose from Dotson&#x27;s estranged wife, Melissa Kethley, and by Sonya Hart, the mother of Baylor athlete Robert Hart. They reported widespread abuse of marijuana and alcohol among Baylor players that was subsequently ignored by Bliss and his staff. Sonya Hart revealed that she had raised concerns about the drug use with associate athletic director Paul Bradshaw, but that no one ever got back in contact with her.

===Recruiting violations===
On August 5, two members of the 2002–2003 Baylor basketball team told &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; that members of the coaching staff were present during a pickup game involving recruit Harvey Thomas during his official visit to Baylor. One of the two players said that Bliss and assistant coach Rodney Belcher were both present during the game. NCAA rules state that staff observation of a recruit&#x27;s athletic activities, directly or indirectly, during their official visit to their university constitute an &quot;illegal tryout.&quot;

===Prior violations at SMU===
It was also revealed that Bliss had apparently broken several NCAA regulations during his tenure at Baylor and during his tenure at Southern Methodist University (SMU) from 1980 to 1988. At the time, both schools were members of the Southwest Conference. On August 2, an NCAA memo obtained by the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; detailed major rules violations, including booster payments of $2,000 to $5,000 to center Jon Koncak during his junior and senior years. Both Bliss and SMU received no NCAA penalties for the infractions because the university had already received the death penalty for massive violations in their football program in February 1987, and the decision was made not to further punish the SMU athletic department. Shortly after the investigation, Bliss left SMU to take a position at New Mexico in 1988, before joining the Baylor program in 1999.

==Bliss resignation==
For his part, Bliss denied all allegations saying, &quot;We have followed the rules, however difficult they may be, for 30 years.&quot; However, on the day after Dennehy&#x27;s memorial service, Bliss met with Baylor investigators and was told that Dennehy&#x27;s girlfriend had accused him of paying the portions of Dennehy and Herring&#x27;s tuition not covered by financial aid. Both payments violated NCAA rules. Bliss confessed to making the payments, which totaled $7,000. This, combined with the violations of Baylor&#x27;s drug test policy and Bliss&#x27; presence at Thomas&#x27; official visit to Baylor, led Sloan to force his resignation on August 8, 2003. Athletic director Tom Stanton resigned on the same day. Although there was no evidence that Stanton knew of the violations, he resigned to take responsibility for what happened.

===Preliminary sanctions imposed===
On the same day that Bliss resigned, Baylor&#x27;s investigative committee announced their preliminary findings and imposed preliminary sanctions on the basketball program. Baylor placed itself on two years&#x27; probation and withdrew from the 2003-04 Big 12 Conference tournament, effectively removing itself from postseason consideration. A full release was granted to every player in the men&#x27;s basketball program; any player who wished to transfer would be allowed to do so without penalty.

===Lying to investigators===
On August 16, the &quot;Star-Telegram&quot; reported that Bliss had told players to lie to investigators by indicating that Dennehy had paid for his tuition by dealing drugs. These conversations were taped on microcassette by assistant coach Abar Rouse from July 30 to August 1. On the tapes, Bliss was heard instructing players to fabricate the story of Dennehy being a drug dealer to Baylor investigators and also said that talking to the McLennan County Sheriff&#x27;s Department would give him the opportunity to &quot;practice&quot; his story. The tapes also showed that Bliss and his staff knew that Dennehy had been threatened by two teammates when they publicly denied such knowledge. Rouse taped the conversations after Bliss threatened to fire him if he did not go along with the scheme. The revelations shocked Baylor and the college basketball community. However, despite the potential allegations of extortion, obstruction of justice and witness tampering, no criminal charges were filed against Bliss.

==Penalties==
Baylor continued to investigate the basketball program over the next seven months and released their final report on February 26, 2004. The full list of major program violations included:

* Bliss paying for tuition for two players, Dennehy and Herring, and attempting to conceal it.
* Coaching staff providing meals, transportation, lodging and clothing to athletes.
* Coaching staff paying for tuition and fees for a recruit at another school.
* Bliss&#x27;s encouragement of school boosters to donate to a foundation tied to a basketball team that included prospective Baylor recruits.
* Failure to report positive drug test results by athletes.
* Failure by the entire coaching staff to &quot;exercise institutional control over the basketball program.&quot;

Other improprieties of a lesser nature were also discovered.

As a result, Baylor imposed further penalties on the basketball program. The program&#x27;s probation was extended for an additional year, scholarships were reduced for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons, expense-paid recruiting visits were also reduced for the next two seasons, other recruiting abilities were also inhibited, and one exhibition game was eliminated for the 2004–05 season. Baylor announced that it would re-certify its entire athletic department conformed to NCAA rules. Baylor forwarded its findings to the NCAA, who imposed further penalties on the school on June 23, 2005:

* The university&#x27;s probation was extended until June 22, 2010.
* Baylor was barred from playing any nonconference games for the 2005–06 season, the first time such a &quot;half-season&quot; penalty had been imposed.
* The NCAA further reduced Baylor&#x27;s paid recruiting visits from twelve to nine for the 2006–07 season. (Baylor had already imposed restrictions on recruiting visits for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons.)
* In addition, other smaller penalties were also imposed on Baylor.

The NCAA also imposed a ten-year show-cause penalty on Bliss for &quot;unethical conduct.&quot; This meant that until 2015, any NCAA member school that wanted to hire Bliss had to report to the organization every six months stating that he was in compliance with any restrictions the NCAA imposed on him, unless that school could demonstrate that Bliss had served his punishment. It is the most severe penalty the NCAA can hand a coach. As most schools will not even consider hiring someone with a show-cause order outstanding, the order had the effect of blackballing Bliss from the NCAA coaching ranks for the duration of the penalty. The NCAA found that Bliss and his staff had demonstrated &quot;a blatant and sweeping disregard&quot; for their rules. Besides paying parts of Dennehy and Herring&#x27;s tuition, Bliss admitted that he&#x27;d concealed under-the-table payments to Herring and lied to both the NCAA and Baylor investigators. He also admitted to telling assistant coaches to file false expense reports and lie to Baylor investigators.

Doug Ash, who had been Bliss&#x27;s top assistant throughout Bliss&#x27;s coaching career at Oklahoma, SMU, New Mexico and Baylor, was hit with a five-year show-cause order. Another former assistant, Rodney Belcher, was hit with a seven-year show-cause order.

In its final report, the NCAA called the violations at Baylor as serious as those which occurred at SMU almost twenty years earlier. Indeed, Baylor was eligible for the death penalty since its men&#x27;s tennis program was on probation for major violations; the NCAA can hand down the death penalty for a second major violation within five years, even if it occurs in a different sport. However, the organization praised Baylor for taking prompt action once the violations came to light (in marked contrast to SMU, where there was evidence that administrators knew about the violations and did nothing).

==Aftermath==
The scandal left Baylor&#x27;s basketball program in ruins. Lawrence Roberts, John Lucas III, Kenny Taylor, and Tyrone Nelson transferred to other schools. Two of the four became immediate stars at programs that would win regular-season conference titles in 2004 – Roberts became the main inside force at Mississippi State, leading their team in scoring and rebounding and being selected as a first-team All-American, while Lucas stayed in the conference at Oklahoma State, becoming their second-leading scorer and assists leader while helping his team to reach the Final Four. Taylor transferred to the University of Texas at Austin and Nelson enrolled at Prairie View A&amp;M University. A year later, Herring transferred to Canisius College.

Bliss&#x27; successor, Scott Drew, was hired two weeks after Bliss&#x27; ouster. Due to his unusually late hiring–two months before practice and three months before the season opener–and the crippling sanctions imposed by both the school and the NCAA, Baylor only won a total of 36 games, including only thirteen conference games, from 2003 to 2007. However, Drew quickly turned the program around after his recruits arrived; Baylor made the 2008 NCAA tournament, finished second in the 2009 NIT, and advanced to the Elite Eight of the 2010 and 2012 NCAA tournaments—the school&#x27;s deepest NCAA run since going to the Final Four in 1950. In 2019–20, Drew led the Bears to the greatest season in school history at the time. Baylor finished with a 26-4 regular-season record, was ranked 4th in the final Coaches Poll, and was projected to a #1 seed in the 2020 NCAA tournament which would&#x27;ve been a first for the program. Unfortunately for Baylor, the 2020 Tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following season, Baylor won the Big 12 regular season title for the first time in program history, received a #1 seed for the 2021 NCAA tournament&#x27;s South Region, advanced to its first Final Four appearance since 1950, and made its first title game appearance since 1948, where the Bears won their first national championship.

Rouse sued his attorney in 2005 for releasing the incriminating tapes of Bliss, claiming that it breached the attorney–client privilege. Rouse&#x27;s attorney claims she did not know how the tapes got transcribed, but the journalist who published them said he got them from her.

After Baylor, Rouse worked as a graduate assistant coach at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. He left the position in October 2007 and has not had another basketball job since; he has said that he has been effectively blackballed from the collegiate ranks for taping Bliss&#x27;s statements. Despite the near-universal revulsion at Bliss&#x27;s actions, many leading members of the college basketball coaching fraternity considered Rouse&#x27;s recordings a serious breach of trust. For example, Mike Krzyzewski said that if he ever found out one of his assistants had been secretly taping him, &quot;there&#x27;s no way he would be on my staff&quot;. Jeff Ray, the Midwestern coach who hired Rouse, commented: &quot;I&#x27;m right in the middle of it, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But sometimes the things you see are pretty disgusting. Why is there this black cloud hanging over him? He did nothing wrong. To me, this is all a testimony to the sad state of affairs of our profession.&quot;

Bliss eventually returned to the college basketball coaching ranks, in 2015, as head coach at Southwestern Christian University, an NAIA member. He resigned that position in April 2017, following the airing of the Showtime documentary &quot;Disgraced&quot;, which chronicled the cover-up at Baylor.

<text>In mathematics, the order of a finite group is the number of its elements. If a group is not finite, one says that its order is &quot;infinite&quot;. The &quot;order&quot; of an element of a group (also called period length or period) is the order of the subgroup generated by the element. If the group operation is denoted as a multiplication, the order of an element of a group, is thus the smallest positive integer such that , where denotes the identity element of the group, and denotes the product of copies of . If no such exists, the order of is infinite. 

The order of a group is denoted by or , and the order of an element is denoted by or , instead of formula_1 where the brackets denote the generated group.

Lagrange&#x27;s theorem states that for any subgroup of a finite group , the order of the subgroup divides the order of the group; that is, is a divisor of . In particular, the order of any element is a divisor of .

==Example==
The symmetric group S3 has the following multiplication table.

This group has six elements, so . By definition, the order of the identity, , is one, since . Each of , , and squares to , so these group elements have order two: . Finally, and have order 3, since , and .

==Order and structure==
The order of a group &quot;G&quot; and the orders of its elements give much information about the structure of the group. Roughly speaking, the more complicated the factorization of |&quot;G&quot;|, the more complicated the structure of &quot;G&quot;.

For |&quot;G&quot;| = 1, the group is trivial. In any group, only the identity element &quot;a = e&quot; has ord(&quot;a)&quot; = 1. If every non-identity element in &quot;G&quot; is equal to its inverse (so that &quot;a&quot;2 = &quot;e&quot;), then ord(&quot;a&quot;) = 2; this implies &quot;G&quot; is abelian since formula_2. The converse is not true; for example, the (additive) cyclic group Z6 of integers modulo 6 is abelian, but the number 2 has order 3:

:formula_3.

The relationship between the two concepts of order is the following: if we write
:formula_4
for the subgroup generated by &quot;a&quot;, then
:formula_5

For any integer &quot;k&quot;, we have
:&quot;ak&quot; = &quot;e&quot;   if and only if   ord(&quot;a&quot;) divides &quot;k&quot;.

In general, the order of any subgroup of &quot;G&quot; divides the order of &quot;G&quot;. More precisely: if &quot;H&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, then
:ord(&quot;G&quot;) / ord(&quot;H&quot;) = [&quot;G&quot; : &quot;H&quot;], where [&quot;G&quot; : &quot;H&quot;] is called the index of &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, an integer. This is Lagrange&#x27;s theorem. (This is, however, only true when G has finite order. If ord(&quot;G&quot;) = ∞, the quotient ord(&quot;G&quot;) / ord(&quot;H&quot;) does not make sense.)

As an immediate consequence of the above, we see that the order of every element of a group divides the order of the group. For example, in the symmetric group shown above, where ord(S3) = 6, the possible orders of the elements are 1, 2, 3 or 6.

The following partial converse is true for finite groups: if &quot;d&quot; divides the order of a group &quot;G&quot; and &quot;d&quot; is a prime number, then there exists an element of order &quot;d&quot; in &quot;G&quot; (this is sometimes called Cauchy&#x27;s theorem). The statement does not hold for composite orders, e.g. the Klein four-group does not have an element of order four. This can be shown by inductive proof. The consequences of the theorem include: the order of a group &quot;G&quot; is a power of a prime &quot;p&quot; if and only if ord(&quot;a&quot;) is some power of &quot;p&quot; for every &quot;a&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.

If &quot;a&quot; has infinite order, then all non-zero powers of &quot;a&quot; have infinite order as well. If &quot;a&quot; has finite order, we have the following formula for the order of the powers of &quot;a&quot;:
:ord(&quot;ak&quot;) = ord(&quot;a&quot;) / gcd(ord(&quot;a&quot;), &quot;k&quot;)
for every integer &quot;k&quot;. In particular, &quot;a&quot; and its inverse &quot;a&quot;−1 have the same order.

In any group, 
:formula_6

There is no general formula relating the order of a product &quot;ab&quot; to the orders of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. In fact, it is possible that both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; have finite order while &quot;ab&quot; has infinite order, or that both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; have infinite order while &quot;ab&quot; has finite order. An example of the former is &quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 2−&quot;x&quot;, &quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1−&quot;x&quot; with &quot;ab&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;−1 in the group formula_7. An example of the latter is &quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;+1, &quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;−1 with &quot;ab&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;. If &quot;ab&quot; = &quot;ba&quot;, we can at least say that ord(&quot;ab&quot;) divides lcm(ord(&quot;a&quot;), ord(&quot;b&quot;)). As a consequence, one can prove that in a finite abelian group, if &quot;m&quot; denotes the maximum of all the orders of the group&#x27;s elements, then every element&#x27;s order divides &quot;m&quot;.

==Counting by order of elements==
Suppose &quot;G&quot; is a finite group of order &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; is a divisor of &quot;n&quot;. The number of order &quot;d&quot; elements in &quot;G&quot; is a multiple of φ(&quot;d&quot;) (possibly zero), where φ is Euler&#x27;s totient function, giving the number of positive integers no larger than &quot;d&quot; and coprime to it. For example, in the case of S3, φ(3) = 2, and we have exactly two elements of order 3. The theorem provides no useful information about elements of order 2, because φ(2) = 1, and is only of limited utility for composite &quot;d&quot; such as &quot;d&quot; = 6, since φ(6) = 2, and there are zero elements of order 6 in S3.

==In relation to homomorphisms==
Group homomorphisms tend to reduce the orders of elements: if &quot;f&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; is a homomorphism, and &quot;a&quot; is an element of &quot;G&quot; of finite order, then ord(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)) divides ord(&quot;a&quot;). If &quot;f&quot; is injective, then ord(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)) = ord(&quot;a&quot;). This can often be used to prove that there are no homomorphisms or no injective homomorphisms, between two explicitly given groups. (For example, there can be no nontrivial homomorphism &quot;h&quot;: S3 → Z5, because every number except zero in Z5 has order 5, which does not divide the orders 1, 2, and 3 of elements in S3.) A further consequence is that conjugate elements have the same order.

==Class equation==
An important result about orders is the class equation; it relates the order of a finite group &quot;G&quot; to the order of its center Z(&quot;G&quot;) and the sizes of its non-trivial conjugacy classes:
:formula_8
where the &quot;di&quot; are the sizes of the non-trivial conjugacy classes; these are proper divisors of |&quot;G&quot;| bigger than one, and they are also equal to the indices of the centralizers in &quot;G&quot; of the representatives of the non-trivial conjugacy classes. For example, the center of S3 is just the trivial group with the single element &quot;e&quot;, and the equation reads |S3| = 1+2+3.

<text>Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy and College is a religious school of the Society of St. Pius X located in St. Marys, Kansas.

== The original St. Mary&#x27;s College ==
The original college at this location, St. Mary&#x27;s College, was founded by the Jesuits in 1848 as an Indian mission. The school is the site of the first cathedral west of the Missouri River and east of the Rockies, the 1851 &quot;log cathedral&quot; of Bishop John Baptist Miège, S.J., Apostolic Vicar of Kansas under Pope Pius IX known familiarly as &quot;The Bishop East of the Rockies&quot;.

When the Potawatomi were forcibly removed, the Jesuits turned it into a boarding school for boys, until it closed during the Great Depression. After 1931 the 465 acre (1.9 km²) plot hosted the divinity school of St. Louis University. With the movement of seminaries to the city after Vatican II, the land was sold and the Jesuit divinity school returned to St. Louis in 1967.

=== Athletics ===
The St. Mary&#x27;s athletic teams were called the Knights. The college was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) from 1902–03 to 1930–31, the season where the school closed.

===Notable people===
;Alumni
* Robert Casey (1890–1962), combat veteran, newspaper correspondent and columnist for &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;.
* Charles Comiskey (1859–1931), baseball player, manager, team owner. He was the founding owner of the Chicago White Sox. Comiskey Park was named for him.
;Faculty
* Ernest Quigley (1880–1960), basketball referee, umpire in Major League Baseball, football coach at Kansas Wesleyan University. At St. Mary&#x27;s College, he was coach, teacher, athletic director from 1903 to 1912.

== Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy and College ==
In 1978, the Society of Saint Pius X acquired the property along with 12 major buildings. The school is now incorporated in Kansas as &quot;The Society of Saint Pius X of Saint Mary&#x27;s, Inc.&quot; It has no ties with the previous St. Mary&#x27;s College.

In 2002, the governor of Kansas formally recognized Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy and College for the excellence of its educational curriculum. While neither the Academy nor the College are accredited by any accreditation agencies, they do operate with approval from the Kansas Board of Regents.

As of 2024, the Academy had an enrollment of over 900 students K-12 and the two-year college has expanded to a four-year bachelors program with an enrollment of 60 in a liberal arts curriculum. St. Mary&#x27;s does not have a seminary program.

The school has operated its own radio station, KSMK-LP 98.3 FM, since 2002.

=== Athletics ===

The Academy teams play in the Kansas Christian League in football and soccer and against some non-league teams.

==== Controversy ====
In February 2008, St. Mary&#x27;s Academy made news when a female referee was told that she could not officiate at the high school basketball game. The other referee allegedly claimed that someone told him it was because she &quot;could not be put in a position of authority over boys because of the academy&#x27;s beliefs&quot;. The Academy denied this belief. St. Mary&#x27;s Academy was removed from the Kansas State High School Activities Association list of approved schools. They were reinstated two years later.

St. Mary&#x27;s official reply to the incident was in a press release:

: This alleged reason was neither stated nor is it held by any official of St. Mary&#x27;s Academy, as evidenced by the fact that the faculty and staff of St. Mary&#x27;s includes many honorable ladies of talent and erudition...
: St. Mary&#x27;s Academy follows the directives of the Catholic Church regarding co-education. The Church has always promoted the ideal of forming and educating boys and girls separately during the adolescent years, especially in physical education (Cf. Divini Illius Magistri - Encyclical on the Christian Education of Youth, by Pope Pius XI, 1929 and The Instruction of the Sacred Congregation of Religious on Co-Education, A.A.S., 25 (1958) pp. 99-103). This formation of adolescent boys is best accomplished by male role models, as the formation of girls is best accomplished by women. Hence in boys&#x27; athletic competitions, it is important that the various role models (coaches and referees) be men.

In 2004, the school forfeited a football game against White City High School because the opponent had a girl on the team.

=== St. Mary&#x27;s Priory ===

St. Mary&#x27;s Academy and College is also a traditional Catholic congregation of approximately 4,300 persons (2023).

In 2019, St. Mary&#x27;s Academy and College announced plans for the construction of a new Immaculata Church, expected to hold 1500 people and to be the largest SSPX church in Kansas.

On May 3, 2023, the Immaculata Church was consecrated by Bishop Bernard Fellay.

<doc id="493552" wikidata="Q818106" url="?curid=493552" title="Benoni, South Africa">
<text>Benoni is a town on the East Rand, Gauteng, South Africa, some east of Johannesburg, within the City of Ekurhuleni municipality.

Benoni was also the setting for the MTV-inspired movie &quot;Crazy Monkey: Straight Outta Benoni&quot;, released internationally in 2005.

==History==

===Jewish community===
Benoni was previously home to a thriving Jewish community, peaking with 400 Jewish families. Jewish residents were also widely involved in the greater community, with five Jewish mayors.

The Benoni Shul congregation began with a synagogue located on Woburn Avenue in 1907, before relocating to a new, larger synagogue on Park Street in 1933. The synaogue served the community for 90 years, before closing in 2023. Rabbi Lionel Mirvis, father of Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, previously served the congregation. The synagogue was designed in a modernist style by the English architect, Arthur Furner, a partner in Hermann Kallenbach&#x27;s architectural firm, KKF. 

The community was also served by Hillel, a Jewish day school, which closed in 1989, amid Jewish migration to Johannesburg&#x27;s northern suburbs and emigration overseas.

A Jewish cemetery was also established in Benoni in 1912, it is administered by the Benoni Chevrah Kadisha.

Aura Herzog, the former First Lady of Israel, often spent shabbat in Benoni when she was a student in Johannesburg.

== Geography ==
Benoni is situated towards the centre of the East Rand and lies on the urban fringe where the urban area dissolves into the smallholdings and farmland to the north. It borders on Kempton Park to the north-west, Boksburg to the west, Brakpan to the south and Daveyton to the east. 

Benoni mainly encompasses a mixture of suburban areas and semi-rural acreage towards the north while the commercial central business district lies in the centre and a few industrial areas lie towards the south. 

== Transportation ==
=== Rail ===
Benoni lies on the main railway line between Johannesburg and Springs and the main railway line between Johannesburg and Daveyton, both operated by Metrorail which has temporarily suspended services on these commuter lines since 2020 and have remained closed due to vandalism on these lines.

Prior to 2020, Metrorail operated services on the Johannesburg-Springs line from Benoni to Johannesburg, Germiston, Boksburg, Brakpan and Springs. Benoni is served by three Metrorail railway stations on the Johannesburg-Springs line including: Benoni station, New Kleinfontein station and Apex station.

Prior to 2020, Metrorail operated services on the Johannesburg-Daveyton line from Benoni to Johannesburg, Germiston and Boksburg. Benoni is served by three Metrorail railway stations on the Johannesburg-Daveyton line including: Avenue station, Northmead station and Van Ryn station.

=== Road ===
The N12 is the major freeway that runs through Benoni. It enters the town from Boksburg and Johannesburg in the west, bisecting the town and bypassing the CBD to its immediate north before heading east towards eMalahleni. 

The R23 runs north-south from Kempton Park towards Brakpan and Heidelberg and runs through the CBD as Tom Jones Street (southbound) and Bunyan Street (northbound). The R29 runs east-west from Springs towards Boksburg and runs through the CBD as Ampthill Avenue (westbound) and Princess Avenue (eastbound). The R51 runs north-south from Bapsfontein, just outside Benoni towards Springs and barely by-passes Benoni to the east.

Benoni is also served by three metropolitan routes linking it to surrounding towns and cities in the East Rand. The M43 links Benoni with Kempton Park to the north-west and Vosloorus to the south-west. The M44 links Benoni with Boksburg to the west. The M45 links Benoni with Kempton Park to the north-west. The M53 links Benoni with Boksburg to the west and Brakpan to the south.

<doc id="493554" wikidata="Q184370" url="?curid=493554" title="Zeebra">
<text>, known professionally as , is a Japanese hip hop rapper and DJ who made his first appearance in 1995. Zeebra is a former member of the hip-hop group King Giddra, which also included DJ Oasis and K Dub Shine. He went on to pursue a solo career shortly after in 1997, and signed with the Future Shock record label.

Zeebra is one of the most popular rappers in Japan, and his popularity is not specific to either gender. He appears not only in hip-hop magazines, but also in fashion and street culture magazines. He often features in and produces other rappers&#x27; songs, and appears in their videos. He has also performed live with various rappers from America.

In 1998 Zeebra undertook his first solo tour. He became recognized as an individual rapper for the first time, making hip-hop more familiar to Japanese listeners. In the same year he started the radio program in Japan, titled &quot;Beats to the Rhyme&quot;. One of Zeebra&#x27;s songs was used in a Nike promotion video for NBA Japan games. The following year Zeebra released the single &quot;Mr. Dynamite&quot;, the first hip-hop single to break into the top 50 on the Japanese pop charts. In June 2000, he released his new album &quot;Based on a True Story&quot;, which sold 250,000 copies. At the end of that year Zeebra started his first Japan tour, the first hip-hop event to sell out. In 2001 Zeebra released the single &quot;Never Enuff&quot;, the theme song for a Japanese movie called &quot;Brother&quot;, directed by Takeshi Kitano and starring Claude Maki and Omar Epps. In 2002 he temporarily rejoined King Giddra, but has been doing solo work since 2003 and has released many songs. At present, he is producing songs not only for rap artists, but also for pop stars like Namie Amuro.

==Early life==
Zeebra was born and raised in Tokyo. During his childhood, he lived in the United States for a brief time while trying to become a professional tennis player.

He is the grandson of businessman Hideki Yokoi, former president of the Hotel New Japan. The hotel&#x27;s flagship property in central Tokyo caught fire in 1982, disgracing Hideki Yokoi and causing Zeebra to be bullied by his classmates. Zeebra eventually dropped out of high school during his first year.

He married around the age of 20 and fathered two sons, Kento and Ren Yokoi, before divorcing his first wife. Ren is a DJ who plays a mixture of House and Techno, where he is also a main MC for Tokyo Scene; Tokyo’s radio show by Inter FM 89.7. He kept custody of both sons, and later remarried to Miwa Nakabayashi, to whom he fathered two daughters, Kanon and Rima Nakabayashi of NiziU. In November 2020, Zeebra and Nakabayashi announced their divorce.

==Pioneer of Japanese Hip Hop==

Zeebra began his hip hop career in 1993, joining the rap group King Giddra. Zeebra, along with his group King Giddra, played an important role in the development of the Japanese hip hop scene. In the mid 1990s, King Giddra, then an underground rap group, began addressing social issues of the time. King Giddra&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;The Power from the Sky&quot; discussed contemporary issues, particularly the economic recession and the inability of many Japanese college graduates to find employment. Zeebra addressed this issue of working towards a good education and being unable to find employment in his song &quot;Bullet of Truth&quot;. Through their music, Zeebra and King Giddra &quot;challenged youth not only to recognize the difficulties faced by Japanese society but also to speak up about them.&quot;

King Giddra&#x27;s popularity grew in Japan. In 1996, he recorded his first solo track &quot;Untouchable&quot; produced by Gang Starr producer DJ Premier. By 1997 Zeebra left King Giddra to start a solo career, appearing frequently in trendy hip hop and street culture magazines and TV shows about hip hop. In 1999 he released the single &quot;Mr. Dynamite&quot;, which became the first hip-hop single to make it into the top 50 on the Japanese Oricon pop charts. Through his early and newer work, Zeebra became one of the most popular and influential, yet controversial, Japanese hip hop artists.

In 2008, after the MTV Video Music Awards Japan Ceremony, an unhappy Zeebra went onto YouTube and published a video criticizing the MTV Japan for not appreciating musicians.

<text>Mark Raymond Kennedy (born April 11, 1957) is an American businessman, politician, and university administrator. Following a career as a business executive, he served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Minnesota from 2001 to 2007. Kennedy did not seek reelection in 2006, instead running in the 2006 election for U.S. Senate, which he lost to Democratic–Farmer–Labor nominee Amy Klobuchar.

Afterward, he became director of The Graduate School of Political Management in 2012, until serving as the 12th president of the University of North Dakota from 2016 to 2019, and then becoming the 23rd president of the University of Colorado (CU) system, in office from 2019 to 2021.

In 2023, Kennedy began serving as Director of the Wilson Center&#x27;s Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition.

==Early life and business career==
Kennedy graduated from Pequot Lakes High School in 1975 and St. John&#x27;s University in 1979. He began his career as a certified public accountant and went on to receive his M.B.A. with distinction from the University of Michigan&#x27;s Ross School of Business in 1983.

Kennedy&#x27;s business career included working for the Pillsbury Company, assisting with its acquisition of Häagen-Dazs and arranging for financing to support its international expansion. As a senior executive at Federated Department Stores, he helped the company position itself for growth to become, as Macy&#x27;s, the world&#x27;s leading department store. He was profiled in May 1992&#x27;s &quot;Institutional Investor Magazine&quot;, which featured him as one of &quot;America&#x27;s top CFOs&quot;. At ShopKo Stores, he was responsible for merchandising, marketing and store management.

In 2000 Kennedy won the Republican nomination for the 2nd district and faced four-term Democratic incumbent David Minge. He had never run for political office before. In the second closest congressional race of that cycle, Kennedy defeated Minge by 155 votes.

Leading up to the 2002 elections, although Minnesota did not gain or lose any districts, Kennedy&#x27;s 2nd district—an enormous 28-county district stretching from the southwestern corner of the state to the fringes of the Twin Cities—was dismantled. Its territory was split up among four neighboring districts. Kennedy&#x27;s home outside Watertown was just inside the reconfigured 6th district, in the Twin Cities&#x27; northern suburbs.

In 2002 Kennedy initially expected to face the 6th district&#x27;s three-term Democratic incumbent, Bill Luther. But the new 6th was somewhat more Republican than its predecessor, and Luther opted to move to the reconfigured 2nd district, where he eventually lost to John Kline. Kennedy instead faced Janet Robert, a lawyer and longtime Democratic activist. In one of the most expensive congressional races in Minnesota history, Kennedy was elected with 57% of the vote.

In 2004, Kennedy faced child safety advocate Patty Wetterling. He received 54% percent of the vote to Wetterling&#x27;s 46%.

===2006 U.S. Senate election===

Kennedy did not seek reelection to the House in 2006. Instead he ran against DFL nominee and Hennepin County Attorney Amy Klobuchar for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by DFL incumbent Mark Dayton. Also in the race were the Independence Party nominee, Robert Fitzgerald; the Green Party nominee, Michael Cavlan; and the Constitution Party nominee, Ben Powers.

Klobuchar won the election, receiving 58% of the vote to Kennedy&#x27;s 38%.

===Political positions===
Kennedy&#x27;s support of the proposed surge in the Iraq War during the 2006 Senate election was described as &quot;bold and smart&quot; on the Brit Hume show on Fox News (Fox News, Brit Hume Show, 12-27-06). Anderson Cooper, an anchor on CNN, said that &quot;Kennedy doesn&#x27;t ignore the elephant in the room. To the contrary, he looks it straight in the eye&quot; (CNN, Anderson Cooper 360°, 10-25-06).

A proponent of free trade, Kennedy voted for giving the president fast-track authority and for the Central America Free Trade Agreement.

Kennedy supported the Bush tax cuts and voted for the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, while co-sponsoring three other bipartisan bills that year that would expand stem cell research. His also sponsored a line-item veto, a lifetime ban on all members of Congress becoming lobbyists, full deductibility of medical expenses, no parole for sex offenders, and Medicare Plan Enrollment Fraud Protection.

Kennedy&#x27;s record of bipartisanship included partnering with 20 Democrats to lead legislation and having more than half the Democrats in the House co-sponsor bills he introduced. Such bills included:
*the Teachers for Tomorrow&#x27;s Careers Act with Rush Holt from New Jersey,
*the Fair Care for the Uninsured Act with Dan Lipinski from Illinois,
*the Rural Access to Emergency Services Act with Earl Pomeroy from North Dakota,
*the Clean Alternatives for Energy Independence Act with Mark Udall from Colorado,
*the Emergency Wetlands Loan Act with Mike Thompson from California,
*the Child Support Enforcement Act with Juanita Millender-McDonald from California, and
*the SLAM Act (to increase penalties on those who traffic and sell methamphetamines) with Darlene Hooley from Oregon.

Kennedy called himself &quot;100% pro-life&quot;. He voted in favor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. He voted to sustain Bush&#x27;s veto of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005 while co-sponsoring three other bipartisan bills that year that would expand stem cell research.

== Post-congressional career (since 2007) ==

===Community activities===

In 2007 Kennedy was appointed to the President&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiation (ACTPN). Part of the Office of the United States Trade Representative, ACTPN considers trade policy issues in the context of overall national interest.

In 2008 Kennedy, along with former Representatives Tim Penny and Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, founded the Economic Club of Minnesota (ECOM), a nonpartisan platform for national and international leaders in business, government, and public policy to present their ideas on how Minnesota can better compete in an increasingly globalized economy. The Economic Club sponsors the Bill Frenzel Champion of Free Trade Award.

Also, in 2008 he established the Frontiers of Freedom Lecture Series at the Eugene J. McCarthy Center for Public Policy at his alma mater, St. John&#x27;s University.

Kennedy became a member of the Economic Club of Washington in 2013.

In 2015 Kennedy was elected to the Council on Foreign Relations.

In 2021 Kennedy was appointed as a United States Air and Space Forces Civic Leader supporting the Secretary of the Air Force.

===Employment===

From 2007 to 2010 Kennedy served as the global retail business development lead at Accenture, a global management consulting and technology services firm. In 2010 he formed Chartwell Strategic Advisors LLC. Kennedy&#x27;s activities through Chartwell include speaking on applying 360° Vision to bridge differences between business and society; the political left and right; the United States and the world.

From 2011 to 2013 Kennedy served as an executive in residence at Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Carey Business School in Baltimore, Maryland, teaching MBA courses on corporate statesmanship, global economic systems, as well as global immersion courses in Brazil and Turkey.

In January 2012 Kennedy accepted the position of director and professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management. During his tenure the school launched two new master&#x27;s programs—one in Spanish with a Latin American focus and one focused on advocacy in the global environment—and was designated as the PR Education Program of the Year by PR Week.

Between 2012 and 2017, Kennedy has also been an adjunct faculty member at Koç University in Istanbul, Turkey.

Kennedy introduced the concept of &quot;Shapeholders&quot; to the field of business strategy—the political, regulatory, media, and activist actors that shape a firm&#x27;s opportunities and risks. Kennedy teaches how to effectively engage shapeholders both at home and abroad to profitably advance business strategies while benefiting society.

=== University of North Dakota President (2016–2019) ===
On March 15, 2016, the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education announced that Kennedy had been selected as the twelfth President of the University of North Dakota. Kennedy, who had filed his application on January 2, 2016, was in February the third of six finalists to visit the school. He succeeded president Robert Kelley, who retired in January 2016, and Ed Schafer, who served as interim President until Kennedy took office on July 1. He was inaugurated on October 10, 2016.

Notable achievements by UND during Kennedy&#x27;s tenure include being ranked by U.S. News as one of the 25 Most Innovative Schools and being awarded the 2017 Big Sky Conference Presidents&#x27; Cup for outstanding student-athlete academic achievement while winning four conference championships in one year.

On May 9, 2017, Kennedy&#x27;s book Shapeholders: Business Success in the Age of Activism was published by Columbia Business School.

On April 9, 2019, Kennedy was named the sole finalist for the position of President at the University of Colorado. On April 10, he stated in an email that he would accept the position.

=== University of Colorado President (2019–2021)===
In April 2019, the University of Colorado Board of Regents named Kennedy the sole finalist for the university presidency in a 9–0 vote. After several contentious public hearings, the Board of Regents elected him to the position in a partisan 5–4 vote. Members of the CU community expressed concerns that Kennedy had insufficient experience to lead CU, and many raised specific concerns about Kennedy&#x27;s ability to lead the university on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. A Denver Post editorial observed, &quot;We are displeased and a little sickened by the orchestrated opposition to Kennedy based not on his qualifications but on his political affiliation. The CU Faculty Council has set out to demonize Kennedy in a disturbing manner that bodes poorly for attracting top candidates for this role in the future. What sane individual with a résumé worthy of any world-class institution would willfully subject himself or herself to the kind of ridicule and public haranguing that Kennedy has faced in recent weeks?&quot; Kennedy started as an employee on June 15 for a transition period with outgoing president Bruce Benson and became president on July 1.

Kennedy’s presidency was marked by several historic milestones for the university in advancing diversity and inclusion, including hiring its first systemwide chief diversity officer, the development of its first Indigenous lands recognition statement, providing support for CU Denver fulfilling its role as newly named Hispanic Servicing Institution, and expanding scholarships for less represented communities, including authorizing match funding for the Charles J. Blackwood, MD, Endowed Memorial Scholarship honoring the School of Medicine&#x27;s first black graduate. Kennedy drew criticism, however, for enacting changes to university policies that some believed might limit staff and faculty members&#x27; ability to publicly support vulnerable communities and to advocate for social change. CU Boulder’s Center for Native American and Indigenous Studies issued a public rebuke after Kennedy used the phrase &quot;trail of tears&quot; colloquially to describe the challenges CU would face if it did not expand online education opportunities. The written rebuke noted that Kennedy&#x27;s use of this term, demonstrated “ignorance of these atrocities at best, and willful verbal harm at worst.” Kennedy issued a formal apology within an hour of concern being raised. In 2021, two actions occurred in Boulder, ranked as America&#x27;s most liberal small town, that were not replicated at the other three communities hosting CU Campuses. CU Boulder&#x27;s Faculty Assembly cited the above examples and others in formally censuring Kennedy for “failure of leadership with respect to diversity, equity, and inclusion,” with 35 Assembly members supporting and 20 members opposing the motion (one abstaining). The other three campuses did not join the action. Kennedy received another rebuke from NAACP Boulder County, which in May 2021 conducted a vote of no confidence and urged the Regents to remove Kennedy from his position. Again, neither the counties that represented CU’s other three campuses, nor the statewide organization, joined the action.

Eight months into Kennedy’s presidency saw the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges associated with navigating a global pandemic, 36 Kennedy, working with the regents, advanced several key initiatives including shepherding a coordinated approach to expanding the university’s online offerings and strengthening its technological infrastructure. The university’s other notable achievements during this time include keeping net tuition flat; 39 garnering $1.4 billion in sponsored research funding and gifts in 2020; 40 increasing graduation and retention rates; creating the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Innovation Fund; 41 completing a strategic plan for the university; and achieving the second highest fundraising year in the university’s history – $455 million in 2020.

In January 2021, the University of Colorado Board of Regents switched partisan control for the first time in 40 years, with Democrats in the majority. On May 10, 2021, Kennedy announced that given changes in the board’s makeup and its focus, he was making plans to leave his position. On June 1, 2021, the Board of Regents announced that administrator Todd Saliman would serve as interim president of the university effective July 1, 2021. On June 17, 2021, the Board of Regents passed a resolution of appreciation for Kennedy, commending him for his service to the university and conferring upon him the title of president emeritus.

=== Wilson Center (since 2022) ===
Kennedy joined the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a non-partisan Washington DC–based think tank, as a Global Fellow focused on geopolitical strategic competition. Kennedy was named Director of the Wilson Center’s newly established Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition aimed at shaping conversations and proposing meaningful policy reforms to strengthen American leadership in the era of great power competition.

Apart from releasing twelve full-length studio albums and numerous collaborative works, Matmos is also well known for their collaboration with Icelandic singer and musician Björk, both on studio recordings and live tours. After being signed to Matador Records for nine years, Matmos signed with Thrill Jockey in 2012. The name &quot;Matmos&quot; refers to the seething lake of evil slime beneath the city Sogo in the 1968 film &quot;Barbarella&quot;.

==Notable work==
In 1998, Matmos remixed the Björk single &quot;Alarm Call&quot;. Subsequently, the duo worked with Björk on her albums &quot;Vespertine&quot; (2001) and &quot;Medúlla&quot; (2004), as well as the &quot;Vespertine&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; tours. In November 2004, Matmos spent 97 hours in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts as artists-in-residence&quot;,&quot; performing music with friends, musical guests and onlookers. The live album &quot;Work, Work, Work&quot;, essentially a &quot;best of&quot; collection of the session, was released as a free download from their website.

Matmos gained notoriety for their use of unconventional samples including &quot;freshly cut hair&quot; and &quot;the amplified neural activity of crayfish&quot; on their first album and &quot;recorded the snips, clicks, snaps, and squelches of various surgical procedures, then nipped and tucked them into seven remarkably accessible, melodic pieces of experimental techno&quot; for their album &quot;A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure&quot;.

In 2011, Matmos participated in a programmed evening of events with the visual arts organisation Auto Italia South East. The event was produced in collaboration with record label Upset The Rhythm and included contributions from experimental electronic musicians Jon Wiese and Birds of Delay. Matmos have since collaborated with a large number of visual artists and arts organisations, including Cafe Oto and Metal.

In 2015, Matmos appeared in the documentary &quot;Soundhunters&quot; directed by Beryl Koltz and broadcast on the Franco-German channel arte as well as on many channels abroad.

In September 2023, the duo announced their forthcoming album &quot;Return to Archive&quot;, marking the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Smithsonian Folkways label, with a three-hour free concert at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. in which they remixed field recordings from the label&#x27;s catalogue in octophonic sound.

===Hit Em===

In 2024, Daniel posted a tweet about a new musical genre called &quot;Hit Em&quot; he claims to have been told in a dream while he was asleep; in the tweet he described the genre to be fixed at 212 BPM and time signature. The post went viral, with electronic music producers attempting to create examples of the fictional genre.

==Personal lives==
Schmidt and Daniel are a couple.

Daniel received a Ph.D. in English from the University of California, Berkeley with a dissertation on the literary cult of melancholy directed by Janet Adelman. He is currently an associate professor in the Department of English at Johns Hopkins University. This brought the band to relocate from San Francisco to Baltimore in August 2007. Daniel also has a personal dance music project, the Soft Pink Truth. He is a contributing writer to the online music magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, and has written the &quot;33 1/3&quot; book on Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;20 Jazz Funk Greats&quot; as well as two books of literary criticism.

Schmidt formerly worked as a teacher in the New Genres Department at the San Francisco Art Institute, and is now a professor of music technology at Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Peabody Institute and the president of the High Zero Foundation, which organizes Baltimore&#x27;s annual High Zero festival of improvised music.

Both Schmidt and Daniel appeared in the Sagan music film &quot;Unseen Forces&quot; by Ryan Junell.

<doc id="493566" wikidata="Q831744" url="?curid=493566" title="Suzhou dialect">
<text>Suzhounese (Suzhounese: ; ), also known as the Suzhou dialect, is the variety of Chinese traditionally spoken in the city of Suzhou in Jiangsu, China. Suzhounese is a variety of Wu Chinese, and was traditionally considered the Wu Chinese prestige dialect. Suzhounese has a large vowel inventory and it is relatively conservative in initials by preserving voiced consonants from Middle Chinese.

==Distribution==
Suzhou dialect is spoken within the city itself and the surrounding area, including migrants living in nearby Shanghai.

The Suzhou dialect is mutually intelligible with dialects spoken in its satellite cities such as Kunshan, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, as well as those spoken in its former satellites Wuxi and Shanghai. It is also partially intelligible with dialects spoken in other areas of the Wu cultural sphere such as Hangzhou and Ningbo. However, it is &quot;not&quot; mutually intelligible with Cantonese or Standard Chinese; but, as all public schools and most broadcast communication in Suzhou use Mandarin exclusively, nearly all speakers of the dialect are at least bilingual. Owing to migration within China, many residents of the city cannot speak the local dialect but can usually understand it after a few months or years in the area.

==History==
==Grammar==

===Personal pronouns===

Second and third-person pronouns are suffixed with 笃 for the plural. The first-person plural is a separate root, 伲 .

===Demonstrative===
In the Suzhou dialect, &quot;geq8&quot; is a very special demonstrative that is used alongside a separate set of proximal and distal demonstratives. &quot;geq8&quot; can indicate referents appearing in a speech situation, which may be close to or far away from the deictic center, and under these conditions, &quot;geq8&quot; is always used in combination with gestures. Hence &quot;geq8&quot; can serve both proximal and distal functions.

哀 with 该 and 弯 with 归 means exactly the same thing and only differ in pronunciation. 
The use of neutral demonstrative pronoun became clear once proximal and neutral demonstrative pronouns are used.

* 哀杯茶是吾葛，掰杯茶是僚葛，弯杯茶是俚葛。

When &quot;搿&quot; refers to time, there is no need to use the proximal and distal in opposition. The role of the neutral demonstrative is very obvious.

* 抗战是民国二十六年到民国三十四年，掰歇(弯歇)辰光日脚勿好过。

In this sentence, &quot;掰歇(弯歇)&quot; cannot be replaced by &quot;哀歇&quot; because the Anti-Japanese War happened more than fifty years ago, so only the neutral or distal demonstrative can be used, not proximal.

When not referring to time, the proximal &quot;哀&quot; and the neutral demonstrative &quot;掰&quot; can be interchanged. For example, the &quot;掰&quot; in &quot;掰个人勿认得&quot; can be replaced by &quot;哀&quot;.

&quot;哀&quot;, &quot;该&quot;, &quot;掰&quot;, &quot;弯&quot; and &quot;归&quot; cannot be used as subjects or objects alone, but must be combined with the following quantifiers, locative words, etc.

Example phrases:
* 哀歇啥辰光则？
现在什么时候了？
What time is it now?
* 哀呛倷身体好啘？
现阵子你身体好吗？
How are you now?

==Varieties==
Some non-native speakers of Suzhou speak the Suzhou dialect in a &quot;stylized variety&quot; to tell tales.

==Phonology==
===Initials===

The Suzhou dialect has series of voiced, voiceless, and aspirated stops, and voiceless and voiced fricatives. Moreover, palatalized initials also occur.

===Finals===
 
:Syllabic continuants: 

Notes:
*The Suzhou dialect has a rare contrast between &quot;fricative vowels&quot; and ordinary vowels .
* is pronounced before rounded vowels.
* is a true mid vowel, . May also be transcribed with the Sinological symbol /ᴇ/. 
*In open syllables, is articulated close to a position for a close back vowel 
*Depending on the source, transcriptions differ:
** may also be transcribed as 
** may also be transcribed as ; also applies to on-glide final rhymes 
** may also be transcribed as 
**Close vowels may be analyzed as diphthongs and transcribed as 

====Historical Finals====

The Suzhou dialect allows a nasal coda but does not distinguish between them. As such, the Middle Chinese nasal codas have largely either merged or been lost depending on the vowel it follows. Historical rimes following certain vowels are distinguished as the nasalized vowels , but otherwise merge into modern . Historical and rimes are entirely merged and also result in modern , or are lost after certain vowels becoming modern . Modern also results from the monophthongization of the historical diphthong rime ( in Baxter&#x27;s notation, corresponding to the 咍 final).

Middle Chinese rimes have become glottal stops, . Like other Northern Wu varieties, syllables with an underlying glottal stop coda usually manifest as a shortening of the vowel instead of an actual glottal stop , unless before a pause or at the end of an utterance.

===Tones===
Suzhou is considered to have seven tones. However, since the tone split dating from Middle Chinese still depends on the voicing of the initial consonant. Yang tones are only found with voiced initials, namely [b d ɡ z v dʑ ʑ m n nʲ ŋ l ɦ], while the yin tones are only found with voiceless initials. These constitute just three phonemic tones: &quot;ping&quot;, &quot;shang,&quot; and &quot;qu.&quot; (&quot;Ru&quot; syllables are phonemically toneless.)

In Suzhou, the Middle Chinese 阳上 tone and 阳去 tones have fully merged as (2)31. The original 阳去 313 tone still occurs in tone sandhi patterns as the second element of a chain, following a 阴入 syllable. Therefore, 买 and 卖 has exactly the same pronunciation in literary and colloquial readings.

====Tone Sandhi====

The tone sandhi present in Suzhou dialect introduces 4 completely new tones. (33), (21), (212), and (2)

A. Stop final + stop final

The both two-character in this combination do not change tone.

* 脚色 tɕiɑʔ˦ səʔ˦
* 吃力 tɕʰiəʔ˨˧ liəʔ˨˧
* 白虱 bɑʔ˨˧ səʔ˦
* 特别 dəʔ˨˧ biəʔ˨˧

B. Stop final + clear final

The first character do not change tones. The second character do not change tone if it has a yin (阴) tone.

* 作兴 tsoʔ˦ ɕin˦
* 铁饼 tʰiəʔ˦ pin˥˨
* 国庆 kuəʔ˦ tɕʰin˦˩˨

If the second character is yangping (阳平), it becomes (44), the same as yinping (阴平).

* 失眠 səʔ˦ miɪ˦
* 黑魚 həʔ˦ ŋ˦

If the second character is yangqu (阳去), it becomes (21) or (212).

* 赤佬 tsʰəʔ˦ læ˨˩
* 吃饭 tɕʰiəʔ˦ ve˨˩˨

C. Clear final + stop final

The second character&#x27;s tone becomes (2). The first character does not change tone if it has a ping (平) or yinshang (阴上) tone.

* 书桌 sʮ˦ tsoʔ˨
* 牛角 nʲiʏ˨˨˦ koʔ˨
* 海蛰 he˥˨ zəʔ˨

If the first character is yinqu (阴去) it becomes (44) similar to yinping or (52) similar to yinshang.

* 信壳 sin˦ kʰoʔ˨
* 半日 pø˥˨ zəʔ˨

前字阳去多数变 (224) 调, 即与阳平同调; 少数不变。

* 料作 liæ˨˨˦ tsoʔ˨
* 满月 mø˨˨˦ ŋəʔ˨
* 技术 dʑi˦˩˨ zəʔ˨

D. Clear final + clear final

The first character does not change tone if it has a ping (平) or yinshang (阴上) tone.

If the first character is yinqu (阴去) it becomes (44) similar to yinping or (52) similar to yinshang.

If the first character is yangqu (阳去) it becomes (224) similar to yangping.

The second character becomes (21) after yinping tones.

The second character becomes (33), (21) after yinshang, yinqu, yangping, yangqu tones.

== Suzhou dialect in literature ==
Ballad-narratives

A &quot;ballad–narrative&quot; () known as &quot;The story of Xue Rengui crossing the sea and Pacifying Liao&quot; (), which is about the Tang dynasty hero Xue Rengui is believed to have been written in the Suzhou dialect.

Novels

Han Bangqing wrote &quot;The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai&quot;, one of the earliest novels in Wu dialect, in Suzhou dialect. Suzhou serves as an important drive for Han to write the novel. Suzhou dialect is used in innovative methods to demonstrate urban space and time, as well as the interrupted narrative aesthetics, making it an integral part of an effort, which is presented as a fundamental and self-conscious new thing. Han&#x27;s novel also inspired other authors to write in Wu dialect.

<doc id="493567" wikidata="Q1344812" url="?curid=493567" title="Epididymitis">
<text>Epididymitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the epididymis, a curved structure at the back of the testicle. Onset of pain is typically over a day or two. The pain may improve with raising the testicle. Other symptoms may include swelling of the testicle, burning with urination, or frequent urination. Inflammation of the testicle is commonly also present.

In those who are young and sexually active, gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently the underlying cause. In older males and men who practice insertive anal sex, enteric bacteria are a common cause. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. Conditions that may result in similar symptoms include testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, and testicular cancer. Ultrasound can be useful if the diagnosis is unclear.

Treatment may include pain medications, NSAIDs, and elevation. Recommended antibiotics in those who are young and sexually active are ceftriaxone and doxycycline. Among those who are older, ofloxacin may be used. Complications include infertility and chronic pain. People aged 15 to 35 are most commonly affected, with about 600,000 people within this age group affected per year in the United States.

==Signs and symptoms==

Those aged 15 to 35 are most commonly affected. The acute form usually develops over several days, with pain and swelling frequently in only one testis, which will hang low in the scrotum. There will often be a recent history of dysuria or urethral discharge. Fever is also a common symptom. In the chronic version, the patient may have painful point tenderness but may or may not have an irregular epididymis upon palpation, though palpation may reveal an indurated epididymis. A scrotal ultrasound may reveal problems with the epididymis, but such an ultrasound may also show nothing unusual. The majority of patients who present with chronic epididymitis have had symptoms for over five years.

===Complications===
Untreated, acute epididymitis&#x27;s major complications are abscess formation and testicular infarction. Chronic epididymitis can lead to permanent damage or even destruction of the epididymis and testicle (resulting in infertility and/or hypogonadism), and infection may spread to any other organ or system of the body. Chronic pain is also an associated complication for untreated chronic epididymitis.

== Causes ==
Though urinary tract infections in men are rare, bacterial infection is the most common cause of acute epididymitis. The bacteria in the urethra back-track through the urinary and reproductive structures to the epididymis. In rare circumstances, the infection reaches the epididymis via the bloodstream.

In sexually active men, &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; is responsible for two-thirds of acute cases, followed by &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot; (or other bacteria that cause urinary tract infection). Particularly among men over age 35 in whom the cause is &quot;E. coli&quot;, epididymitis is commonly due to urinary tract obstruction. Less common microbes include &quot;Ureaplasma&quot;, Mycobacterium, and &quot;cytomegalovirus&quot;, or &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; in patients with HIV infection. &quot;E. coli&quot; is more common in boys before puberty, the elderly, and men who have sex with men. In the majority of cases in which bacteria are the cause, only one side of the scrotum or the other is the locus of pain.

Non-infectious causes are also possible. Reflux of sterile urine (urine without bacteria) through the ejaculatory ducts may cause inflammation with obstruction. In children, it may be a response following infection with enterovirus, adenovirus, or &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;. Rare non-infectious causes of chronic epididymitis include sarcoidosis (more prevalent in black men) and Behçet&#x27;s disease.

Any form of epididymitis can be caused by genito-urinary surgery, including prostatectomy and urinary catheterization. Congestive epididymitis is a long-term complication of vasectomy. Chemical epididymitis may also result from drugs such as amiodarone.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. Conditions that may result in similar symptoms include testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, and testicular cancer. Ultrasound can be useful if the diagnosis is unclear.

Epididymitis usually has a gradual onset. Typical findings are redness, warmth, and swelling of the scrotum, with tenderness behind the testicle, away from the middle (this is the normal position of the epididymis relative to the testicle). The cremasteric reflex (elevation of the testicle in response to stroking the upper inner thigh) remains normal. This is a useful sign to distinguish it from testicular torsion. If there is pain relieved by elevation of the testicle, this is called Prehn&#x27;s sign, which is, however, non-specific and is not useful for diagnosis.
Before the advent of sophisticated medical imaging techniques, surgical exploration was the standard of care. Today, Doppler ultrasound is a common test: it can demonstrate areas of blood flow and can distinguish clearly between epididymitis and torsion. However, as torsion and other sources of testicular pain can often be determined by palpation alone, some studies have suggested that the only real benefit of an ultrasound is to assure the person that they do not have testicular cancer. Nuclear testicular blood flow testing is rarely used.

Additional tests may be necessary to identify underlying causes. In younger children, a urinary tract anomaly is frequently found. In sexually active men, tests for sexually transmitted infections may be done. These may include microscopy and culture of a first void urine sample, Gram stain and culture of fluid or a swab from the urethra, nucleic acid amplification tests (to amplify and detect microbial DNA or other nucleic acids) or tests for syphilis and HIV.

===Classification===

Epididymitis can be classified as acute, subacute, and chronic, depending on the duration of symptoms.

====Chronic epididymitis====

Chronic epididymitis is epididymitis that is present for more than 3 months. Chronic epididymitis is characterized by inflammation even when there is no infection present. Tests are needed to distinguish chronic epididymitis from a range of other disorders that can cause constant scrotal pain including testicular cancer (though this is often painless), enlarged scrotal veins (varicocele), calcifications, and a possible cyst within the epididymis. Some research has found that as much as 80% of visits to a urologist for scrotal pain are for chronic epididymitis. As a further complication, the nerves in the scrotal area are closely connected to those of the abdomen, sometimes causing abdominal pain similar to a hernia (see referred pain).

Chronic epididymitis is most commonly associated with lower back pain, and the onset of pain often co-occurs with activity that stresses the low back (i.e., heavy lifting, long periods of car driving, poor posture while sitting, or any other activity that interferes with the normal curve of the lumbar lordosis region).

==Treatment==
In both the acute and chronic forms, antibiotics are used if an infection is suspected. The treatment of choice is often azithromycin and cefixime to cover both gonorrhoeae and chlamydia. Fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended due to widespread resistance of gonorrhoeae to this class. Doxycycline may be used as an alternative to azithromycin. In chronic epididymitis, a four- to six-week course of antibiotics may be prescribed to ensure the complete eradication of any possible bacterial cause, especially the various chlamydiae.

For cases caused by enteric organisms (such as &quot;E. coli&quot;), ofloxacin or levofloxacin are recommended.

In children, fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are best avoided. Since bacteria that cause urinary tract infections are often the cause of epididymitis in children, co-trimoxazole or suited penicillins (for example, cephalexin) can be used.

Household remedies such as elevation of the scrotum and cold compresses applied regularly to the scrotum may relieve the pain in acute cases. Painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs are often used for the treatment of both chronic and acute forms. Hospitalisation is indicated for severe cases, and check-ups can ensure the infection has cleared up. Surgical removal of the epididymis is rarely necessary, causes sterility, and only gives relief from pain in approximately 50% of cases. However, in acute suppurating epididymitis (acute epididymitis with a discharge of pus), an epididymotomy may be recommended; in refractory cases, a full epididymectomy may be required. In cases with unrelenting testicular pain, removal of the entire testicle—orchiectomy—may also be warranted.

It is generally believed that most cases of chronic epididymitis will eventually &quot;burn out&quot; of the patient&#x27;s system if left untreated, though this might take years or even decades. However, some prostate-related medications have proven effective in treating chronic epididymitis, including doxazosin.

==Epidemiology==
Epididymitis makes up 1 in 144 visits for medical care (0.69 percent) in men 18 to 50 years old or 600,000 cases in males between 18 and 35 in the United States.

It occurs primarily in those 16 to 30 years of age and 51 to 70 years. As of 2008, there appears to be an increase in incidence in the United States that parallels an increase in reported cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea.

<text>The Strait of Baltiysk (, , ) is a strait enabling passage from the Baltic Sea into the brackish Vistula Lagoon, located in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia. The constructed strait separates the Vistula Spit from the peninsula (called Pillau Peninsula in Russia: Пиллауский полуостров, after the ) which was part of the Vistula Spit in the 15th century and now is part of Sambian Peninsula.

==Shipping==
The strait is the shipping connection from the high sea to the important Russian ports of Baltiysk and Kaliningrad in the northeastern lagoon, as well as to the Polish ports of Elbląg, Braniewo, Tolkmicko, Frombork, Sztutowo, Krynica Morska, and Nowa Pasłęka in the southeastern lagoon. 
On 17 September 2022, Poland opened a new canal through the Vistula Spit, which will allow ships to enter the Polish port of Elbląg without passing through the Strait of Baltiysk in Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad region.

===Russian blockade===
The Strait of Baltiysk is a strait where international navigation is governed by a non-suspendable innocent passage regime under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (dead-end strait). Despite the law since the 1990s Russia periodically blocks navigation via the strait to Polish ports.

Since 2006, Poland had considered digging another canal across the Vistula Spit in order to circumvent this restriction. The Vistula Spit canal started construction in 2019 and opened in 2022.

==History==
In 1497 a storm surge dug a new gat, then called the &quot;Neues [Pillauer] Tief&quot; or &quot;Pillauer Seetief&quot; (New [Pillau] Deep, Pillau Sea Deep), through the Vistula Spit. In 1510 another storm surge widened and deepened that gat to navigability. It measured in length and in width. In 1626 King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden landed with 37 ships next to the gat, at a spot already slightly fortified, transforming it into the , and holding it for ten years (till the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf), also in order to pressure his brother-in-law George William, Duke of Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg, to support him in the Polish–Swedish War and the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Swedes extended the adjacent Pillau village and built its first place of worship, a Lutheran church. In 1638 the Duke moved his residence to the close-by ducal capital Königsberg in Prussia.

In the 1960s the gat was expanded and now it measures in width and in depth.

<doc id="493572" wikidata="Q3568177" url="?curid=493572" title="Wilfrid Backhouse Alexander">
<text>Wilfrid Backhouse Alexander (4 February 1885 – 18 December 1965) was an English ornithologist and entomologist. He was a brother of Horace Alexander and Christopher James Alexander.

Alexander was born at Croydon in Surrey, England in 1885, and was introduced to natural history by his two uncles, James and Albert Crosfield. He was educated at Bootham School in York and Tonbridge School in Kent, and went on to study Natural Science at Cambridge University. During this time his main interest was botany, graduating in 1909 with first class honours.

==Career==
After graduation he stayed in Cambridge for a short time working as assistant superintendent of the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology and assistant demonstrator in Zoology and Comparative Anatomy for Cambridge University. In 1911, he took a job with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries as an assistant naturalist on an international exploration of the North Sea, but in August that year, he obtained the appointment of Assistant at the Western Australian Museum. He moved to Australia in early 1912 to take up the position, which he held for three years before being made Keeper of Biology at the museum.

===Australia===
He made a number of expeditions to collect material for the museum including the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition to the Abrolhos Islands in 1913. He became Honorary Secretary of and co-editor of the journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia in 1914. In 1916, the museum was under severe financial pressure and Alexander was granted leave without pay to take up a position as science abstractor to the Advisory Council of Science and Industry in Melbourne. He held this position until 1919, when he returned to the Western Australian Museum for a short time. During this period he also acted as librarian to the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, which he became vice-president of from 1923 to 1925. He was also editor of the union&#x27;s journal, &quot;Emu&quot;, from 1924 to 1925.

In 1920 the Commonwealth Prickly Pear Board was formed with the purpose of finding a way to control the several species of &quot;Opuntia&quot; that were taking over vast areas of subtropical eastern Australia and W. B. Alexander was appointed biologist to the board. The project took him on visits to North and South America in search of a suitable insect agent and in 1924 he was promoted to Officer-in-charge. The result of these overseas investigations was the highly successful use of &quot;Cactoblastis&quot; moths in controlling the &quot;Opuntia&quot; species in Australia and also arousing his interest in oceanic birds. So when he left Australia in 1926 he spent most of the year at the American Museum of Natural History preparing the book &quot;Birds of the Ocean&quot; (1928), a forerunner of later field guides, before returning to England.

===Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology===
He had no regular employment from 1926 until he was appointed superintendent of the Marine Biological Association’s Tees Estuary survey in 1929. Then in 1930 he was appointed Director of the Oxford Bird Census which developed into the Oxford University Research in Economic Ornithology in 1931, then an Institute of Field Ornithology, funded by the newly formed British Trust for Ornithology in 1933. In 1938, it was officially recognized by Oxford University as the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology. In 1945 he retired as director and became the institute&#x27;s librarian, remaining so until 1955. The donation of his personal collection of bird books had provided the original nucleus of the library, and it was named after him in 1947.

He was awarded the Tucker Medal of the British Trust for Ornithology in 1955 and the Union Medal of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1959.

He spent his retirement in Parkstone, Dorset, southern England, where he died on 8 December 1965.

<text>Collin Clark Peterson (born June 29, 1944) is an American accountant, politician, and lobbyist who served as the U.S. representative for from 1991 to 2021. A member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), he was chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture from 2019 to 2021 having previously held the office from 2007 to 2011; he had been ranking member from 2011 to 2019 and 2005 to 2007. Peterson was the most senior U.S. Representative from Minnesota and the dean of Minnesota&#x27;s congressional delegation. In 2020, Peterson was defeated by Michelle Fischbach, ending his 30-year tenure in the United States House of Representatives. In 2022, Peterson registered as a federal lobbyist after opening an eponymous consulting firm.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Collin Peterson was born in Fargo, North Dakota, grew up on a farm in Baker, Minnesota, and received his B.A. at Minnesota State University Moorhead.

Peterson was a member of the Minnesota Senate for the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (the Minnesota branch of the Democratic Party) from 1977 to 1986, representing a district in northwestern Minnesota. In 1976, he defeated Republican nominee Frank DeGroat 55%-45%. In 1982, he won re-election against state representative Cal Larson by just 200 votes, or 0.8% difference.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
====1980s====
In 1984, he ran for Minnesota&#x27;s 7th congressional district in Northwestern Minnesota, held by Republican Arlan Stangeland. Peterson lost 57%–43%. In 1986, he ran in a rematch and narrowly lost by just 121 votes. In 1988, he ran again but lost in the DFL primary to state senator Marv Hanson 55%–45%. Hanson went on to lose to Stangeland 55%–45%.

====1990s====
In 1990, he ran for a fourth time and won the primary. In the general election, he finally defeated seven-term incumbent Stangeland by 54%–46%. Stangeland&#x27;s stock had dropped sharply after he admitted to making a number of personal calls on his House credit card.

In 1992, Peterson narrowly won re-election by a 50%–49% margin against former state representative Bernie Omann. In a 1994 rematch, Peterson won again by a 51%–49% margin, despite the Republican Revolution. In 1996, he won re-election with 68% of the vote, and won every county in the district. In 1998, he won re-election with 72% of the vote.

====2000s====
In the 2000s, Peterson never faced a serious re-election challenge and only once did he win re-election with less than two-thirds of the vote. In 2000, he was mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate against Republican Rod Grams, but he chose to run for re-election, winning with 69% of the vote. In 2002, he won with 65% of the vote. In 2004, he won with 66% of the vote. In 2006, he won with 70% of the vote. In 2008, he won with 72% of the vote.

====2010s====
In 2010, Peterson survived another Republican wave election. This time, he defeated Lee Byberg 55%–38%, his worst election performance since 1994. In 2012, Peterson won re-election with 60.38% to Republican Lee Byberg&#x27;s 34.85% and Independent Adam Steele&#x27;s 4.67%.

In 2013, Republicans began pressuring Peterson, in hopes of convincing him to retire. His seat was one of only a handful represented by a Democrat which had been carried by Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. Republican opposition tactics included airing television advertisements, hiring a press staffer to give opposition research to reporters, hiring a tracker to follow him around his district and record him, and sending mobile billboards with critical statements on them to drive around his hometown. Peterson responded by saying, &quot;They don&#x27;t have anybody else to go after. It&#x27;s kind of ridiculous, but whatever.&quot; After Republicans spread rumors that Peterson was planning to buy a house in Florida and retire there, he said: &quot;I went from neutral on running again to 90 percent just because of this stupid stuff they&#x27;re doing. You can&#x27;t let these people be in charge of anything, in my opinion.&quot; On March 17, 2014, Peterson officially announced that he was running for re-election, saying, &quot;I still have a lot of work to do&quot;. Despite being heavily targeted by national Republican groups, Peterson defeated Republican State Senator Torrey Westrom in the general election by 54% to 46%.

In October 2014, Peterson said that he may keep running until 2020 because the Republicans &quot;made me mad&quot; with their efforts to defeat him or persuade him to retire. In January 2015, he stated that he was &quot;running at this point&quot; for re-election in 2016, saying that the efforts by Republicans to unseat him had &quot;energized me&quot; and &quot;got me fired up&quot;. He was challenged by Republican retired Air Force Major Dave Hughes and beat him in close races in 2016 and 2018.

Peterson held onto his seat despite a growing Republican trend in the region. From 2000 to 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried it by double digits three out of five times. This culminated in 2016, when Donald Trump carried the district with 62 percent of the vote, his best showing in the state. Peterson thus sat in one of the most Republican districts in the country to be represented by a Democrat.

In the November 2020 general election, Peterson was defeated for reelection by Republican former state senator and former lieutenant governor Michelle Fischbach. In that same election, Trump again carried the 7th with his best margin in the state, this time with 64 percent and a 29-point margin. Peterson lost to Fischbach by a 14-point margin, the largest margin of defeat for any House incumbent that year. Despite his loss, he was the top-performing Democratic representative compared to presidential nominee Joe Biden, outperforming him by 16 points in the district. Peterson was the only non-freshman member of the House of Representatives to lose re-election in 2020, and Minnesota&#x27;s 7th district was one of only two congressional districts that Republicans flipped in 2020 that they did not hold prior to 2018, the other being Iowa&#x27;s 2nd congressional district.

===Caucus membership===
* Military Veterans Caucus, Co-chairman
* Congressional Arts Caucus

==Political positions==
Peterson is one of the founders of the Blue Dog Coalition, the caucus of House Democrats who identify as moderates and conservatives. He was one of the most conservative Democrats in recent American history and frequently crossed the party line. Peterson had split from his party on issues such as gay marriage, healthcare, the estate tax, tort reform, gun control, the environment, DC statehood, and abortion. In 2008, a report by Congressional Quarterly found he had the lowest party loyalty score over the previous five years of any member of the Minnesota congressional delegation. In the 109th Congress, he was rated 50% conservative by a conservative group and 57% progressive by a liberal group.

During the first session of the 115th United States Congress, Peterson was ranked the most bipartisan member of the House of Representatives by the Bipartisan Index, a metric created by the Lugar Center and Georgetown&#x27;s McCourt School of Public Policy to assess congressional bipartisanship.

===Social issues===
Peterson is generally conservative on social issues; he strongly opposes legal abortion and has been one of the few Democrats to vote against embryonic stem cell research. He has voted to ban physician-assisted suicide and also to approve the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment to the United States Constitution. He also voted for the Defense of Marriage Act and supports the death penalty.

In January 2019, in reference to President Trump&#x27;s proposed wall across the southern border, Peterson said, &quot;I&#x27;d give him the whole thing ... and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this? We&#x27;re going to build that wall anyway, at some time.&quot; Peterson furthered that there could be stipulations requiring some funding go toward Border Patrol and security measures at ports of entry being improved.

On April 4, 2019, Peterson was the only Democrat to vote against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, citing his disappointment with the law being &quot;made partisan with the inclusion of language that would strip individuals&#x27; right to due process with respect to their 2nd Amendment rights.&quot;

===Hunting and conservationism===
His district contains some of the most conservative counties in the state and also the state&#x27;s most rural district; many DFLers outside the Twin Cities are hunters and trappers who oppose gun control. Peterson is a conservationist, but opposes &quot;excessive environmental regulation&quot; because he argues they harm farmers. He is an avid hunter and supports animal trapping, but in 2000 he joined with the Humane Society of the United States to pass legislation that stopped the interstate shipping of birds for cockfighting. He has supported legislation that would end protection for wolves in the Endangered Species Act.

In 2004, he joined with Minnesota attorney general Mike Hatch in suing the state of North Dakota over what they argued were discriminatory laws that forbade non–North Dakota residents from hunting during the first week of the waterfowl hunting season. Their case was rejected by the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota, a decision which was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

===Guns===
Peterson is a &quot;staunch&quot; supporter of gun rights. He has received successive &quot;A&quot; and &quot;A+&quot; ratings from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), with endorsements in 2010, 2014 and 2020.

===Economic issues===
Although he&#x27;s been called a strong fiscal conservative, he is somewhat closer to the left wing of his party on certain economic issues: he has voted against most free trade agreements, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Freedom to Farm Act, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. He also voted against both versions of the Patriot Act and he has been sharply critical of the No Child Left Behind Act, which he contends is unfair to rural students. He supports the FairTax, a national sales tax, estate-tax repeal and tort reform. He voted for the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act.

Peterson joined the House Republicans in voting against the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

Along with John Conyers, in April 2006 Peterson brought an action against George W. Bush and others alleging violations of the Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The case (&quot;Conyers v. Bush&quot;) was ultimately dismissed.

On January 28, 2009, Peterson was amongst the seven Democrats who voted in the House together with the unanimous Republican opposition against President Obama&#x27;s stimulus package (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009).

===International trade===
In 1998, as part of an effort to change what were considered unequal fishing regulations between the U.S. and Canada, Peterson gained attention by proposing a constitutional amendment that would allow the residents of Minnesota&#x27;s Northwest Angle to vote on whether they wanted to secede from the United States and join the Canadian province of Manitoba. Peterson said that the amendment, which was part of a mock secession movement, was successful in bringing the issue to the attention of the White House: &quot;In just the day after I introduced (the amendment), people from the vice president&#x27;s office have been asking questions, people in the White House (too). I&#x27;ve got meetings scheduled with the U.S. trade representative... we&#x27;ve educated people on both sides of the border, and I think we&#x27;ve brought it closer to the point where we&#x27;ll get this thing resolved.&quot;

=== Healthcare ===
In 2003, he was one of just 16 Democrats to vote for President Bush&#x27;s Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act.

On March 21, 2010, Peterson voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). In January 2016, he voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (he was the sole Democrat in the House to vote for the repeal). In 2017, he voted against Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

=== Agriculture ===
In January 2005, he was selected by the House Democratic Caucus to succeed former Texas congressman Charlie Stenholm as the ranking member on the Committee on Agriculture. He became the committee&#x27;s chairman after the Democrats won control of the House two years later.

Peterson was a cosponsor of the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act of 2005 which would provide job protection for three million illegal immigrant agricultural workers and their families, and extend the visas of legal immigrant agricultural workers.

In addition to this, Peterson was the chair of the House committee on Agriculture in the 116th Congress.

=== Military ===
Peterson was one of the few Democrats to vote in favor of the Military Commissions Act of 2006.

=== Price gouging ===
In May 2007, Peterson was the lone Democrat to vote against the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act.

=== Hate crimes ===
In April 2009, Peterson voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

=== Environmental issues ===
On May 6, 2009, Peterson voiced his opposition to climate change legislation proposed by the Obama administration saying, &quot;I will not support any kind of climate change bill – even if you fix this – because I don&#x27;t trust anybody anymore. I&#x27;ve had it.&quot; Peterson predicted that an Environmental Protection Agency proposal to assess indirect effects of ethanol production on greenhouse gas emissions, combined with the climate change legislation, could &quot;kill off corn ethanol.&quot;

=== Town meetings ===
On July 27, 2009, a controversy erupted after Peterson was quoted in a Politico.com article saying, &quot;25 percent of my people believe the Pentagon and Rumsfeld were responsible for taking the twin towers down. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t do town meetings.&quot; The state Republican Party denounced the remark as &quot;outrageous and offensive&quot;. Peterson apologized for the comment, which he described as &quot;off-hand&quot;.

=== Abortion ===
Peterson is an anti-abortion Democrat. In 2010, he was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee.

In 2011, he co-sponsored HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. The bill contained an exception for &quot;forcible rape,&quot; which opponents criticized as potentially excluding drug-facilitated rape, date rape, and other forms of rape. The bill also allowed an exception for minors who are victims of incest.

=== LGBT rights ===

Peterson supported a Constitutional Amendment that would ban legal recognition of same-sex marriages in the United States.

=== Yemeni civil war ===
Peterson was one of five House Democrats who voted for the US to continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia and to support the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Asked why he voted against the resolution and what he knew about the Yemeni civil war, Peterson said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know a damn thing about it&quot;. Peterson also said that the resolution on US involvement in the Yemeni civil war would have jeopardized a farm bill that was under consideration at the same time; according to New York magazine&#x27;s Eric Levitz, &quot;by all accounts, voting against the Yemen resolution would not have doomed the farm bill.&quot;

=== Impeachment of Donald Trump ===
On October 31, 2019, he was one of two Democrats to vote against Article I of the impeachment inquiries against President Donald Trump, and one of the three Democrats to vote against Article II. He again was one of two Democrats, alongside Jeff Van Drew, to vote against impeachment on December 18, 2019.

Peterson indicated that he would have voted in favor of the second impeachment if he was in the House.

=== D.C. statehood ===
On June 26, 2020, Peterson was the only Democratic representative to break with his party when he voted against H.R. 51, a bill that would allow for Washington, D.C. to be admitted as the country&#x27;s 51st state.

===Marijuana===
Peterson was one of six House Democrats to vote against the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act to legalize cannabis at the federal level in 2020.

<text>ISO/IEC 2022 &quot;Information technology—Character code structure and extension techniques&quot;, is an ISO/IEC standard in the field of character encoding. It is equivalent to the ECMA standard ECMA-35, the ANSI standard ANSI X3.41 and the Japanese Industrial Standard JIS X 0202. Originating in 1971, it was most recently revised in 1994.

ISO 2022 specifies a general structure which character encodings can conform to, dedicating particular ranges of bytes (0x00–1F and 0x7F–9F) to be used for non-printing control codes for formatting and in-band instructions (such as line breaks or formatting instructions for text terminals), rather than graphical characters. It also specifies a syntax for escape sequences, multiple-byte sequences beginning with the control code, which can likewise be used for in-band instructions. Specific sets of control codes and escape sequences designed to be used with ISO 2022 include ISO/IEC 6429, portions of which are implemented by ANSI.SYS and terminal emulators.

ISO 2022 itself also defines particular control codes and escape sequences which can be used for switching between different coded character sets (for example, between ASCII and the Japanese JIS X 0208) so as to use multiple in a single document, effectively combining them into a single stateful encoding (a feature less important since the advent of Unicode). It is designed to be usable in both 8-bit environments and 7-bit environments (those where only seven bits are usable in a byte, such as e-mail without 8BITMIME).

==Encodings and conformance==
The ASCII character set supports the ISO Basic Latin alphabet (equivalent to the English alphabet), and does not provide good support for languages which use additional letters, or which use a different writing system altogether. Other writing systems with relatively few characters, such as Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic or Hebrew, as well as forms of the Latin script using diacritics or letters absent from the ISO Basic Latin alphabet, have historically been represented on personal computers with different 8-bit, single byte, extended ASCII encodings, which follow ASCII when the most significant bit is 0 (i.e. bytes 0x00–7F, when represented in hexadecimal), and include additional characters for a most significant bit of 1 (i.e. bytes 0x80–FF). Some of these, such as the ISO 8859 series, conform to ISO 2022, while others such as DOS code page 437 do not, usually due to not reserving the bytes 0x80–9F for control codes.

Certain East Asian languages, specifically Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (collectively &quot;CJK&quot;), are written using far more characters than the maximum of 256 which can be represented in a single byte, and were first represented on computers with language-specific double-byte encodings or variable-width encodings; some of these (such as the Simplified Chinese encoding ) conform to , while others (such as the Traditional Chinese encoding Big5) do not. Control codes in ISO 2022 are always represented with a single byte, regardless of the number of bytes used for graphical characters. CJK encodings used in 7-bit environments which use mechanisms to switch between character sets are often given names starting with &quot;ISO-2022-&quot;, most notably ISO-2022-JP, although some other CJK encodings such as EUC-JP also make use of ISO 2022 mechanisms.

Since the first 256 code points of Unicode were taken from ISO 8859-1, Unicode inherits the concept of C0 and C1 control codes from ISO 2022, although it adds other non-printing characters besides the ISO 2022 control codes. However, Unicode transformation formats such as UTF-8 generally deviate from the ISO 2022 structure in various ways, including:
* Using 8-bit bytes, but not representing the C1 codes in their single-byte forms specified in ISO 2022 (most UTFs, one exception being the obsolete UTF-1)
* Representing all characters, including control codes, with multiple bytes (e.g. UTF-16, UTF-32)
* Mixing bytes with the most significant bit set and unset within the coded representation for a single code point (e.g. UTF-1, )

ISO 2022 escape sequences do, however, exist for switching to and from UTF-8 as a &quot;coding system different from that of ISO 2022&quot;, which are supported by certain terminal emulators such as xterm.

==Overview==

===Elements===
ISO/IEC 2022 specifies the following:

* An infrastructure of multiple character sets with particular structures which may be included in a single character encoding system, including multiple graphical character sets and multiple sets of both primary (C0) and secondary (C1) control codes,
* A format for encoding these sets, assuming that 8 bits are available per byte,
* A format for encoding these sets in the same encoding system when only 7 bits are available per byte, and a method for transforming any conformant character data to pass through such a 7-bit environment,
* The general structure of ANSI escape codes, and
* Specific escape code formats for identifying individual character sets, for announcing the use of particular encoding features or subsets, and for interacting with or switching to other encoding systems.

===Code versions===

A specific implementation does not have to implement all of the standard; the conformance level and the supported character sets are defined by the implementation. Although many of the mechanisms defined by the ISO/IEC 2022 standard are infrequently used, several established encodings are based on a subset of the ISO/IEC 2022 system. In particular, 7-bit encoding systems using ISO/IEC 2022 mechanisms include ISO-2022-JP (or JIS encoding), which has primarily been used in Japanese-language e-mail. 8-bit encoding systems conforming to ISO/IEC 2022 include ISO/IEC 4873 (ECMA-43), which is in turn conformed to by ISO/IEC 8859, and Extended Unix Code, which is used for East Asian languages. More specialised applications of ISO 2022 include the MARC-8 encoding system used in MARC 21 library records.

===Designation escape sequences===

The escape sequences for switching to particular character sets or encodings are registered with the ISO-IR registry (except for those set apart for private use, the meanings of which are defined by vendors, or by protocol specifications such as ARIB STD-B24) and follow the patterns defined within the standard. Character encodings making use of these escape sequences require data to be processed sequentially in a forward direction, since the correct interpretation of the data depends on previously encountered escape sequences.

Specific profiles such as ISO-2022-JP may impose extra conditions, such as that the current character set is reset to US-ASCII before the end of a line. Furthermore, the escape sequences declaring the national character sets may be absent if a specific ISO-2022-based encoding permits or requires this, and dictates that particular national character sets are to be used. For example, ISO-8859-1 states that no defining escape sequence is needed.

===Multi-byte characters===

To represent large character sets, ISO/IEC 2022 builds on ISO/IEC 646&#x27;s property that a seven-bit character representation will normally be able to represent 94 graphic (printable) characters (in addition to space and 33 control characters); if only the C0 control codes (narrowly defined) are excluded, this can be expanded to 96 characters. Using two bytes, it is thus possible to represent up to 8,836 (94×94) characters; and, using three bytes, up to 830,584 (94×94×94) characters. Though the standard defines it, no registered character set uses three bytes (although EUC-TW&#x27;s unregistered G2 does, as does the similarly unregistered CCCII).

For the two-byte character sets, the code point of each character is normally specified in so-called &quot;row-cell&quot; or &quot;kuten&quot; form, which comprises two numbers between 1 and 94 inclusive, specifying a row and cell of that character within the zone. For a three-byte set, an additional &quot;plane&quot; number is included at the beginning. The escape sequences do not only declare which character set is being used, but also whether the set is single-byte or multi-byte (although not how many bytes it uses if it is multi-byte), and also whether each byte has 94 or 96 permitted values.

==Code structure==

===Notation and nomenclature===
ISO/IEC 2022 coding specifies a two-layer mapping between character codes and displayed characters. Escape sequences allow any of a large registry of graphic character sets to be &quot;designated&quot; into one of four working sets, named G0 through G3, and shorter control sequences specify the working set that is &quot;invoked&quot; to interpret bytes in the stream.

Encoding byte values (&quot;bit combinations&quot;) are often given in column-line notation, where two decimal numbers in the range 00–15 (each corresponding to a single hexadecimal digit) are separated by a slash. Hence, for instance, codes 2/0 (0x20) through 2/15 (0x2F) inclusive may be referred to as &quot;column 02&quot;. This is the notation used in the ISO/IEC 2022 / ECMA-35 standard itself. They may be described elsewhere using hexadecimal, as is often used in this article, or using the corresponding ASCII characters, although the escape sequences are actually defined in terms of byte values, and the graphic assigned to that byte value may be altered without affecting the control sequence.

Byte values from the 7-bit ASCII graphic range (hexadecimal 0x20–0x7F), being on the left side of a character code table, are referred to as &quot;GL&quot; codes &quot;(with &quot;GL&quot; standing for &quot;graphics left&quot;)&quot; while bytes from the &quot;high ASCII&quot; range (0xA0–0xFF), if available (i.e. in an 8-bit environment), are referred to as the &quot;GR&quot; codes &quot;(&quot;graphics right&quot;)&quot;. The terms &quot;CL&quot; (0x00–0x1F) and &quot;CR&quot; (0x80–0x9F) are defined for the control ranges, but the CL range always invokes the primary (C0) controls, whereas the CR range always either invokes the secondary (C1) controls or is unused.

===Fixed coded characters===
The delete character DEL (0x7F), the escape character ESC (0x1B) and the space character SP (0x20) are designated &quot;fixed&quot; coded characters and are always available when G0 is invoked over GL, irrespective of what character sets are designated. They may not be included in graphical character sets, although other sizes or types of whitespace character may be.

===General syntax of escape sequences===
Sequences using the ESC (escape) character take the form codice_1, where the ESC character is followed by zero or more intermediate bytes () from the range 0x20–0x2F, and one final byte () from the range 0x30–0x7E.

The first byte, or absence thereof, determines the type of escape sequence; it might, for instance, designate a working set, or denote a single control function. In all types of escape sequences, bytes in the range 0x30–0x3F are reserved for unregistered private uses defined by prior agreement between parties.

Control functions from some sets may make use of further bytes following the escape sequence proper. For example, the ISO 6429 control function &quot;&quot;, which can be represented using an escape sequence, is followed by zero or more bytes in the range 0x30–0x3F, then zero or more bytes in the range 0x20–0x2F, then by a single byte in the range 0x40–0x7E, the entire sequence being called a &quot;control sequence&quot;.

===Graphical character sets===
Each of the four working sets G0 through G3 may be a 94-character set or a 94n-character multi-byte set. Additionally, G1 through G3 may be a 96- or 96n-character set.

In a 96- or 96n-character set, the bytes 0x20 through 0x7F when GL-invoked, or 0xA0 through 0xFF when GR-invoked, are allocated to and may be used by the set. In a 94- or 94n-character set, the bytes 0x20 and 0x7F are not used. When a 96- or 96n-character set is invoked in the GL region, the space and delete characters (codes 0x20 and 0x7F) are not available until a 94- or 94n-character set (such as the G0 set) is invoked in GL. 96-character sets cannot be designated to G0.

Registration of a set as a 96-character set does not necessarily mean that the 0x20/A0 and 0x7F/FF bytes are actually assigned by the set; some examples of graphical character sets which are registered as 96-sets but do not use those bytes include the G1 set of I.S. 434, the box drawing set from ISO/IEC 10367, and ISO-IR-164 (a subset of the G1 set of ISO-8859-8 with only the letters, used by CCITT).

===Combining characters===
Characters are expected to be spacing characters, not combining characters, unless specified otherwise by the graphical set in question. ISO 2022 / ECMA-35 also recognizes the use of the backspace and carriage return control characters as means of combining otherwise spacing characters, as well as the CSI sequence &quot;Graphic Character Combination&quot; (GCC) (codice_2).

Use of the backspace and carriage return in this manner is permitted by ISO/IEC 646 but prohibited by ISO/IEC 4873 / ECMA-43 and by ISO/IEC 8859, on the basis that it leaves the graphical character repertoire undefined. ISO/IEC 4873 / ECMA-43 does, however, permit the use of the GCC function provided that the sequence of characters is kept the same and merely displayed in one space, rather than being over-stamped to form a character with a different meaning.

===Control character sets===
Control character sets are classified as &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;secondary&quot; control code sets, respectively also called &quot;C0&quot; and &quot;C1&quot; control code sets.

A C0 control set must contain the ESC (escape) control character at 0x1B (a C0 set containing only ESC is registered as ISO-IR-104), whereas a C1 control set may not contain the escape control whatsoever. Hence, they are entirely separate registrations, with a C0 set being only a C0 set and a C1 set being only a C1 set.

If codes from the C0 set of ISO 6429 / ECMA-48, i.e. the ASCII control codes, appear in the C0 set, they are required to appear at their ISO 6429 / ECMA-48 locations. Inclusion of transmission control characters in the C0 set, besides the ten included by ISO 6429 / ECMA-48 (namely SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, ENQ, ACK, DLE, NAK, SYN and ETB), or inclusion of any of those ten in the C1 set, is also prohibited by the ISO/IEC 2022 / ECMA-35 standard.

A C0 control set is invoked over the CL range 0x00 through 0x1F, whereas a C1 control function may be invoked over the CR range 0x80 through 0x9F (in an 8-bit environment) or by using escape sequences (in a 7-bit or 8-bit environment), but not both. Which style of C1 invocation is used must be specified in the definition of the code version. For example, ISO/IEC 4873 specifies CR bytes for the C1 controls which it uses (SS2 and SS3). If necessary, which invocation is used may be communicated using announcer sequences.

In the latter case, single control functions from the C1 control code set are invoked using &quot;type Fe&quot; escape sequences, meaning those where the ESC control character is followed by a byte from columns 04 or 05 (that is to say, codice_3 through codice_4).

===Other control functions===
Additional control functions are assigned to &quot;type Fs&quot; escape sequences (in the range codice_5 through codice_6); these have permanently assigned meanings rather than depending on the C0 or C1 designations. Registration of control functions to type &quot;Fs&quot; sequences must be approved by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2. Other single control functions may be registered to type &quot;3Ft&quot; escape sequences (in the range codice_7 through codice_8), although no &quot;3Ft&quot; sequences are currently assigned (as of 2019). Some of these are specified in ECMA-35 (ISO 2022 / ANSI X3.41), others in ECMA-48 (ISO 6429 / ANSI X3.64). ECMA-48 refers to these as &quot;independent control functions&quot;.

Escape sequences of type &quot;Fp&quot; (codice_9 through codice_10) or of type &quot;3Fp&quot; (codice_11 through codice_12) are reserved for single private use control codes, by prior agreement between parties. Several such sequences of both types are used by DEC terminals such as the VT100, and are thus supported by terminal emulators.

===Shift functions===
By default, GL codes specify G0 characters and GR codes (where available) specify G1 characters; this may be otherwise specified by prior agreement. The set invoked over each area may also be modified with control codes referred to as shifts, as shown in the table below.

An 8-bit code may have GR codes specifying G1 characters, i.e. with its corresponding 7-bit code using Shift In and Shift Out to switch between the sets (e.g. JIS X 0201), although some instead have GR codes specifying G2 characters, with the corresponding 7-bit code using a single-shift code to access the second set (e.g. T.51).

The codes shown in the table below are the most common encodings of these control codes, conforming to ISO/IEC 6429. The LS2, LS3, LS1R, LS2R and LS3R shifts are registered as single control functions and are always encoded as the escape sequences listed below, whereas the others are part of a C0 or C1 control code set (as shown below, SI (LS0) and SO (LS1) are C0 controls and SS2 and SS3 are C1 controls), meaning that their coding and availability may vary depending on which control sets are designated: they must be present in the designated control sets if their functionality is used. The C1 controls themselves, as mentioned above, may be represented using escape sequences or 8-bit bytes, but not both.

Alternative encodings of the single-shifts as C0 control codes are available in certain control code sets. For example, SS2 and SS3 are usually available at 0x19 and 0x1D respectively in T.51 and T.61. This coding is currently recommended by ISO/IEC 2022 / ECMA-35 for applications requiring 7-bit single-byte representations of SS2 and SS3, and may also be used for SS2 only, although older code sets with SS2 at 0x1C also exist, and were mentioned as such in an earlier edition of the standard. The 0x8E and 0x8F coding of the single shifts as shown below is mandatory for ISO/IEC 4873 levels 2 and 3.

Although officially considered shift codes and named accordingly, single-shift codes are not always viewed as shifts, and they may simply be viewed as prefix bytes (i.e. the first bytes in a multi-byte sequence), since they do not require the encoder to keep the currently active set as state, unlike locking shift codes. In 8-bit environments, either GL or GR, but not both, may be used as the single-shift area. This must be specified in the definition of the code version. For instance, ISO/IEC 4873 specifies GL, whereas packed EUC specifies GR. In 7-bit environments, only GL is used as the single-shift area. If necessary, which single-shift area is used may be communicated using announcer sequences.

The names &quot;locking shift zero&quot; (LS0) and &quot;locking shift one&quot; (LS1) refer to the same pair of C0 control characters (0x0F and 0x0E) as the names &quot;shift in&quot; (SI) and &quot;shift out&quot; (SO). However, the standard refers to them as LS0 and LS1 when they are used in 8-bit environments and as SI and SO when they are used in 7-bit environments.

The ISO/IEC 2022 / ECMA-35 standard permits, but discourages, invoking G1, G2 or G3 in both GL and GR simultaneously.

===Registration of graphical and control code sets===
The &quot;ISO International register of coded character sets to be used with escape sequences&quot; (ISO-IR) lists graphical character sets, control code sets, single control codes and so forth which have been registered for use with ISO/IEC 2022. The procedure for registering codes and sets with the ISO-IR registry is specified by ISO/IEC 2375. Each registration receives a unique escape sequence, and a unique registry entry number to identify it. For example, the CCITT character set for Simplified Chinese is known as ISO-IR-165.

Registration of coded character sets with the ISO-IR registry identifies the documents specifying the character set or control function associated with an ISO/IEC 2022 non‑private-use escape sequence. This may be a standard document; however, registration does not create a new ISO standard, does not commit the ISO or IEC to adopt it as an international standard, and does not commit the ISO or IEC to add any of its characters to the Universal Coded Character Set.

ISO-IR registered escape sequences are also used encapsulated in a Formal Public Identifier to identify character sets used for numeric character references in SGML (ISO 8879). For example, the string can be used to identify the International Reference Version of ISO 646-1983, and the HTML 4.01 specification uses to identify Unicode. The textual representation of the escape sequence, included in the third element of the FPI, will be recognised by SGML implementations for supported character sets.

===Character set designations===
Escape sequences to designate character sets take the form codice_13. As mentioned above, the intermediate () bytes are from the range 0x20–0x2F, and the final () byte is from the range 0x30–0x7E. The first byte (or, for a multi-byte set, the first two) identifies the type of character set and the working set it is to be designated to, whereas the byte (and any additional bytes) identify the character set itself, as assigned in the ISO-IR register (or, for the private-use escape sequences, by prior agreement).

Additional bytes may be added before the byte to extend the byte range. This is currently only used with 94-character sets, where codes of the form codice_14 have been assigned. At the other extreme, no multibyte 96-sets have been registered, so the sequences below are strictly theoretical.

As with other escape sequence types, the range 0x30–0x3F is reserved for private-use bytes, in this case for private-use character set definitions (which might include unregistered sets defined by protocols such as ARIB STD-B24 or MARC-8, or vendor-specific sets such as DEC Special Graphics). However, in a graphical set designation sequence, if the second byte (for a single-byte set) or the third byte (for a double-byte set) is 0x20 (space), the set denoted is a &quot;dynamically redefinable character set&quot; (DRCS) defined by prior agreement, which is also considered private use. A graphical set being considered a DRCS implies that it represents a font of exact glyphs, rather than a set of abstract characters. The manner in which DRCS sets and associated fonts are transmitted, allocated and managed is not stipulated by ISO/IEC 2022 / ECMA-35 itself, although it recommends allocating them sequentially starting with byte 0x40 (codice_15); however, a manner for transmitting DRCS fonts is defined within some telecommunication protocols such as World System Teletext.

There are also three special cases for multi-byte codes. The code sequences codice_16, codice_17, and codice_18 were all registered when the contemporary version of the standard allowed multi-byte sets only in G0, so must be accepted in place of the sequences codice_19 through codice_20 to designate to the G0 character set.

There are additional (rarely used) features for switching control character sets, but this is a single-level lookup, in that (as noted above) the C0 set is always invoked over CL, and the C1 set is always invoked over CR or by using escape codes. As noted above, it is required that any C0 character set include the ESC character at position 0x1B, so that further changes are possible. The control set designation sequences (as opposed to the graphical set ones) may also be used from within ISO/IEC 10646 (UCS/Unicode), in contexts where processing ANSI escape codes is appropriate, provided that each byte in the sequence is padded to the code unit size of the encoding.

A table of escape sequence bytes and the designation or other function which they perform is below.
Note that the registry of bytes is independent for the different types. The 94-character graphic set designated by codice_21 through codice_22 is not related in any way to the 96-character set designated by codice_23 through codice_24. And neither of those is related to the 94n-character set designated by codice_25 through codice_26, and so on; the final bytes must be interpreted in context. (Indeed, without any intermediate bytes, codice_27 is a way of specifying the C1 control code 0x81.)

Also note that C0 and C1 control character sets are independent; the C0 control character set designated by codice_28 (which happens to be the NATS control set for newspaper text transmission) is not the same as the C1 control character set designated by codice_29 (the CCITT attribute control set for Videotex).

=== Interaction with other coding systems ===
The standard also defines a way to specify coding systems that do not follow its own structure.

A sequence is also defined for returning to ISO/IEC 2022; the registrations which support this sequence as encoded in ISO/IEC 2022 comprise (as of 2019) various Videotex formats, UTF-8, and UTF-1. A second byte of 0x2F (codice_30) is included in the designation sequences of codes which do not use that byte sequence to return to ISO 2022; they may have their own means to return to ISO 2022 (such as a different or padded sequence) or none at all. All existing registrations of the latter type (as of 2019) are either transparent raw data, Unicode/UCS formats, or subsets thereof.

Of particular interest are the sequences which switch to ISO/IEC 10646 (Unicode) formats which do not follow the ISO/IEC 2022 structure. These include UTF-8 (which does not reserve the range 0x80–0x9F for control characters), its predecessor UTF-1 (which mixes GR and GL bytes in multi-byte codes), and UTF-16 and UTF-32 (which use wider coding units).

Several codes were also registered for subsets (levels 1 and 2) of UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32, as well as for three levels of UCS-2. However, the only codes currently specified by ISO/IEC 10646 are the level-3 codes for UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 and the unspecified-level code for UTF-8, with the rest being listed as deprecated. ISO/IEC 10646 stipulates that the big-endian formats of UTF-16 and UTF-32 are designated by their escape sequences.

Of the sequences switching to UTF-8, codice_31 is the one supported by, for example, xterm.

Although use of a variant of the standard return sequence from UTF-16 and UTF-32 is permitted, the bytes of the escape sequence must be padded to the size of the code unit of the encoding (i.e. codice_32 for UTF-16), i.e. the coding of the standard return sequence does not conform exactly to ISO/IEC 2022. For this reason, the designations for UTF-16 and UTF-32 use a without-standard-return syntax.

For specifying encodings by labels, the X Consortium&#x27;s Compound Text format defines five private-use DOCS sequences.

=== Code structure announcements ===
The sequence &quot;announce code structure&quot; (codice_33) is used to &quot;announce&quot; a specific code structure, or a specific group of ISO 2022 facilities which are used in a particular code version. Although announcements can be combined, certain contradictory combinations (specifically, using locking shift announcements 16–23 with announcements 1, 3 and 4) are prohibited by the standard, as is using additional announcements on top of ISO/IEC 4873 level announcements 12–14 (which fully specify the permissible structural features). Announcement sequences are as follows:

==ISO/IEC 2022 code versions==
Six 7-bit ISO 2022 code versions (ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-CN-EXT, ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-JP-1, ISO-2022-JP-2 and ISO-2022-KR) are defined by IETF RFCs, of which ISO-2022-JP and ISO-2022-KR have been extensively used in the past. A number of other variants are defined by vendors, including IBM. Although UTF-8 is the preferred encoding in HTML5, legacy content in ISO-2022-JP remains sufficiently widespread that the WHATWG encoding standard retains support for it, in contrast to mapping ISO-2022-KR, ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXT entirely to the replacement character, due to concerns about code injection attacks such as cross-site scripting.

8-bit code versions include Extended Unix Code. The ISO/IEC 8859 encodings also follow ISO 2022, in a subset stipulated in ISO/IEC 4873.

===Japanese e-mail versions===
====ISO-2022-JP====
 is a widely used encoding for Japanese, in particular in e-mail. It was introduced for use on the JUNET network and later codified in IETF RFC 1468, dated 1993. It has an advantage over other encodings for Japanese in that it does not require 8-bit clean transmission. Microsoft calls it Code page 50220. It starts in ASCII and includes the following escape sequences:
* codice_34 to switch to ASCII (1 byte per character)
* codice_35 to switch to JIS X 0201-1976 (ISO/IEC 646:JP) Roman set (1 byte per character)
* codice_16 to switch to JIS X 0208-1978 (2 bytes per character)
* codice_18 to switch to JIS X 0208-1983 (2 bytes per character)

Use of the two characters added in JIS X 0208-1990 is permitted, but without including the IRR sequence, i.e. using the same escape sequence as JIS X 0208-1983. Also, due to being registered before designating multi-byte sets except to G0 was possible, the escapes for JIS X 0208 do not include the second -byte .

The RFC notes that some existing systems did not distinguish codice_34 from codice_35, or did not distinguish codice_16 from codice_18, but stipulates that the escape sequences should not be changed by systems simply relaying messages such as e-mails. The WHATWG Encoding Standard referenced by HTML5 handles codice_34 and codice_35 distinctly, but treats codice_16 the same as codice_18 when decoding, and uses only codice_18 for JIS X 0208 when encoding. The RFC also notes that some past systems had made erroneous use of the sequence codice_47 to switch away from JIS X 0208, which is actually registered for ISO-IR-11 (a Swedish variant of ISO 646 and World System Teletext).

====Versions with halfwidth katakana====
Use of codice_48 to switch to the JIS X 0201-1976 Kana set (1 byte per character) is not part of the ISO-2022-JP profile, but is also sometimes used. Python allows it in a variant which it labels ISO-2022-JP-EXT (which also incorporates JIS X 0212 as described below, completing coverage of EUC-JP); this is close in both name and structure to an encoding denoted ISO-2022-JPext by DEC, which furthermore adds a two-byte user-defined region accessed with codice_49 to complete the coverage of Super DEC Kanji. The WHATWG/HTML5 variant permits decoding JIS X 0201 katakana in ISO-2022-JP input, but converts the characters to their JIS X 0208 equivalents upon encoding. Microsoft&#x27;s code page for ISO-2022-JP with JIS X 0201 kana additionally permitted is Code page 50221.

Other, older variants known as JIS7 and JIS8 build directly on the 7-bit and 8-bit encodings defined by JIS X 0201 and allow use of JIS X 0201 kana from G1 without escape sequences, using Shift Out and Shift In or setting the eighth bit (GR-invoked), respectively. They are not widely used; JIS X 0208 support in extended 8-bit JIS X 0201 is more commonly achieved via Shift JIS. Microsoft&#x27;s code page for JIS X 0201-based ISO 2022 with single-byte katakana via Shift Out and Shift In is Code page 50222.

====ISO-2022-JP-2====
 is a multilingual extension of ISO-2022-JP, defined in RFC 1554 (dated 1993), which permits the following escape sequences in addition to the ISO-2022-JP ones. The ISO/IEC 8859 parts are 96-character sets which cannot be designated to G0, and are accessed from G2 using the 7-bit escape sequence form of the single-shift code SS2:
* codice_17 to switch to GB 2312-1980 (2 bytes per character)
* codice_51 to switch to KS X 1001-1992 (2 bytes per character)
* codice_52 to switch to JIS X 0212-1990 (2 bytes per character)
* codice_53 to switch to ISO/IEC 8859-1 high part, Extended Latin 1 set (1 byte per character) &quot;[designated to G2]&quot;
* codice_54 to switch to ISO/IEC 8859-7 high part, Basic Greek set (1 byte per character) &quot;[designated to G2]&quot;

ISO-2022-JP with the ISO-2022-JP-2 representation of JIS X 0212, but not the other extensions, was subsequently dubbed ISO-2022-JP-1 by RFC 2237, dated 1997.

====IBM Japanese TCP====
IBM implements nine 7-bit ISO 2022 based encodings for Japanese, each using a different set of escape sequences: IBM-956, IBM-957, IBM-958, IBM-959, IBM-5052, IBM-5053, IBM-5054, IBM-5055 and ISO-2022-JP, which are collectively termed &quot;TCP/IP Japanese coded character sets&quot;. CCSID 9148 is the standard (RFC 1468) ISO-2022-JP.
====JIS X 0213====
The JIS X 0213 standard, first published in 2000, defines an updated version of ISO-2022-JP, without the ISO-2022-JP-2 extensions, named ISO-2022-JP-3. The additions made by JIS X 0213 compared to the base JIS X 0208 standard resulted in a new registration being made for the extended JIS plane 1, while the new plane 2 received its own registration. The further additions to plane 1 in the 2004 edition of the standard resulted in an additional registration being added to a further revision of the profile, dubbed ISO-2022-JP-2004. In addition to the basic ISO-2022-JP designation codes, the following designations are recognized:
* codice_48 to switch to JIS X 0201-1976 Kana set (1 byte per character)
* codice_56 to switch to JIS X 0213-2000 Plane 1 (2 bytes per character)
* codice_57 to switch to JIS X 0213-2000 Plane 2 (2 bytes per character)
* codice_58 to switch to JIS X 0213-2004 Plane 1 (2 bytes per character, ISO-2022-JP-2004 only)

===Other 7-bit versions===
 is defined in RFC 1557, dated 1993. It encodes ASCII and the Korean double-byte KS X 1001-1992, previously named KS C 5601-1987. Unlike ISO-2022-JP-2, it makes use of the Shift Out and Shift In characters to switch between them, after including codice_59 once at the start of a line to designate KS X 1001 to G1.

&#x27; and &#x27; are defined in RFC 1922, dated 1996. They are 7-bit encodings making use both of the Shift Out and Shift In functions (to shift between G0 and G1), and of the 7-bit escape code forms of the single-shift functions SS2 and SS3 (to access G2 and G3). They support the character sets GB 2312 (for simplified Chinese) and CNS 11643 (for traditional Chinese).

The basic ISO-2022-CN profile uses ASCII as its G0 (shift in) set, and also includes GB 2312 and the first two planes of CNS 11643 (due to these two planes being sufficient to represent all traditional Chinese characters from common Big5, to which the RFC provides a correspondence in an appendix):
* codice_60 to switch to GB 2312-1980 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G1]&quot;
* codice_61 to switch to CNS 11643-1992 Plane 1 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G1]&quot;
* codice_62 to switch to CNS 11643-1992 Plane 2 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G2]&quot;

The ISO-2022-CN-EXT profile permits the following additional sets and planes.
* codice_63 to switch to ISO-IR-165 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G1]&quot;
* codice_64 to switch to CNS 11643-1992 Plane 3 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G3]&quot;
* codice_65 to switch to CNS 11643-1992 Plane 4 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G3]&quot;
* codice_66 to switch to CNS 11643-1992 Plane 5 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G3]&quot;
* codice_67 to switch to CNS 11643-1992 Plane 6 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G3]&quot;
* codice_68 to switch to CNS 11643-1992 Plane 7 (2 bytes per character) &quot;[designated to G3]&quot;

The ISO-2022-CN-EXT profile further lists additional Guobiao standard graphical sets as being permitted, but conditional on their being assigned registered ISO 2022 escape sequences:
* GB 12345 in G1
* GB 7589 or GB 13131 in G2
* GB 7590 or GB 13132 in G3

The character after the codice_69 (for single-byte character sets) or codice_70 (for multi-byte character sets) specifies the type of character set and working set that is designated to. In the above examples, the character codice_71 (0x28) designates a 94-character set to the G0 character set, whereas codice_72, codice_73 or codice_74 (0x29–0x2B) designates to the G1–G3 character sets.

ISO-2022-KR and ISO-2022-CN are used less frequently than ISO-2022-JP, and are sometimes deliberately not supported due to security concerns. Notably, the WHATWG Encoding Standard used by HTML5 maps ISO-2022-KR, ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXT (as well as HZ-GB-2312) to the &quot;replacement&quot; decoder, which maps all input to the replacement character (�), in order to prevent certain cross-site scripting and related attacks, which utilize a difference in encoding support between the client and server. Although the same security concern (allowing sequences of ASCII bytes to be interpreted differently) also applies to ISO-2022-JP and UTF-16, they could not be given this treatment due to being much more frequently used in deployed content.

In April 2024, a security flaw was found in the implementation of ISO-2022-CN-EXT in glibc, which lead to recommendations to disable the encoding entirely on Linux systems.

=== ISO/IEC 4873 ===

A subset of ISO 2022 applied to 8-bit single-byte encodings is defined by ISO/IEC 4873, also published by Ecma International as ECMA-43. ISO/IEC 8859 defines 8-bit codes for ISO/IEC 4873 (or ECMA-43) level 1.

ISO/IEC 4873 / ECMA-43 defines three levels of encoding:

*Level 1, which includes a C0 set, the ASCII G0 set, an optional C1 set and an optional single-byte (94-character or 96-character) G1 set. G0 is invoked over GL, and G1 is invoked over GR. Use of shift functions is not permitted. 
*Level 2, which includes a (94-character or 96-character) single-byte G2 and/or G3 set in addition to a mandatory G1 set. Only the single-shift functions SS2 and SS3 are permitted (i.e. locking shifts are forbidden), and they invoke over the GL region (including 0x20 and 0x7F in the case of a 96-set). SS2 and SS3 must be available in C1 at 0x8E and 0x8F respectively. This minimal required C1 set for ISO 4873 is registered as ISO-IR-105.
*Level 3, which permits the GR locking-shift functions LS1R, LS2R and LS3R in addition to the single shifts, but otherwise has the same restrictions as level 2.

Earlier editions of the standard permitted non-ASCII assignments in the G0 set, provided that the ISO/IEC 646 invariant positions were preserved, that the other positions were assigned to spacing (not combining) characters, that 0x23 was assigned to either £ or #, and that 0x24 was assigned to either $ or ¤. For instance, the 8-bit encoding of JIS X 0201 is compliant with earlier editions. This was subsequently changed to fully specify the ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV / ISO-IR No. 6 set (ASCII).

The use of the ISO/IEC 646 IRV (synchronised with ASCII since 1991) at ISO/IEC 4873 Level 1 with no C1 or G1 set, i.e. using the IRV in an 8-bit environment in which shift codes are not used and the high bit is always zero, is known as ISO 4873 DV, in which DV stands for &quot;Default Version&quot;.

In cases where duplicate characters are available in different sets, the current edition of ISO/IEC 4873 / ECMA-43 only permits using these characters in the lowest numbered working set which they appear in. For instance, if a character appears in both the G1 set and the G3 set, it must be used from the G1 set. However, use from other sets is noted as having been permitted in earlier editions.

ISO/IEC 8859 defines complete encodings at level 1 of ISO/IEC 4873, and does not allow for use of multiple ISO/IEC 8859 parts together. It stipulates that ISO/IEC 10367 should be used instead for levels 2 and 3 of ISO/IEC 4873. ISO/IEC 10367:1991 includes G0 and G1 sets matching those used by the first 9 parts of ISO/IEC 8859 (i.e. those which existed as of 1991, when it was published), and some supplementary sets.

Character set designation escape sequences are used for identifying or switching between versions during information interchange only if required by a further protocol, in which case the standard requires an ISO/IEC 2022 announcer sequence specifying the ISO/IEC 4873 level, followed by a complete set of escapes specifying the character set designations for C0, C1, G0, G1, G2 and G3 respectively (but omitting G2 and G3 designations for level 1), with an -byte of 0x7E denoting an empty set. Each ISO/IEC 4873 level has its own single ISO/IEC 2022 announcer sequence, which are as follows:

===Extended Unix Code===

Extended Unix Code (EUC) is an 8-bit variable-width character encoding system used primarily for Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese. It is based on ISO 2022, and only character sets which conform to the ISO 2022 structure can have EUC forms. Up to four coded character sets can be represented (in G0, G1, G2 and G3). The G0 set is invoked over GL, the G1 set is invoked over GR, and the G2 and G3 sets are (if present) invoked using the single shifts SS2 and SS3, which are used as CR bytes (i.e. 0x8E and 0x8F respectively) and invoke over GR (not GL). Locking shift codes are not used.

The code assigned to the G0 set is ASCII, or the country&#x27;s national ISO 646 character set such as KS-Roman (KS X 1003) or JIS-Roman (the lower half of JIS X 0201). Hence, 0x5C (backslash in US-ASCII) is used to represent a Yen sign in some versions of EUC-JP and a Won sign in some versions of EUC-KR.

G1 is used for a 94x94 coded character set represented in two bytes. The EUC-CN form of and EUC-KR are examples of such two-byte EUC codes. EUC-JP includes characters represented by up to three bytes (i.e. SS3 plus two bytes) whereas a single character in EUC-TW can take up to four bytes (i.e. SS2 plus three bytes).

The EUC code itself does not make use of the announcer or designation sequences from ISO 2022; however, it corresponds to the following sequence of four announcer sequences, with meanings breaking down as follows.

===Compound Text (X11)===
The X Consortium defined an ISO 2022 profile named Compound Text as an interchange format in 1989. This uses only four control codes: NL (newline, coded as , , and (in its 8-bit representation ), with the SDS CSI sequence being used for bidirectional text control. It is an 8-bit code using G0 and G1 for GL and GR, and follows ISO-8859-1 in its initial state. The following F-bytes are used:

For specifying encodings by labels, X11 Compound Text defines five private-use DOCS sequences: () for variable-length encodings, and through for fixed-length encodings using one through four bytes respectively. Rather than using another escape sequence to return to , the two bytes following the initial escape sequence specify the remaining length in bytes, coded in base-128 using bytes . The encoding label is included in ISO 8859-1 before the encoded text, and terminated with ().

==Comparison with other encodings==
===Advantages===
* As ISO/IEC 2022&#x27;s entire range of graphical character encodings can be invoked over GL, the available glyphs are not significantly limited by an inability to represent GR and C1, such as in a system limited to 7-bit encodings. It accordingly enables the representation of large set of characters in such a system. Generally, this 7-bit compatibility is not really an advantage, except for backwards compatibility with older systems. The vast majority of modern computers use 8 bits for each byte.
* As compared to Unicode, ISO/IEC 2022 sidesteps Han unification by using sequence codes to switch between discrete encodings for different East Asian languages. This avoids the issues associated with unification, such as difficulty supporting multiple CJK languages with their associated character variants in a single document and font.

===Disadvantages===
* Since ISO/IEC 2022 is a stateful encoding, a program cannot jump in the middle of a block of text to search, insert or delete characters. This makes manipulation of the text very cumbersome and slow when compared to non-stateful encodings. Any jump in the middle of the text may require a backup to the previous escape sequence before the bytes following the escape sequence can be interpreted.
* Due to the stateful nature of ISO/IEC 2022, an identical and equivalent character may be encoded in different character sets, which may be designated to any of G0 through G3, which may be invoked using single shifts or by using locking shifts to GL or GR. Consequently, characters can be represented in multiple ways, meaning that two visually identical and equivalent strings can not be reliably compared for equality.
* Some systems, like DICOM and several e-mail clients, use a variant of ISO-2022 (e.g. &quot;ISO 2022 IR 100&quot;) in addition to supporting several other encodings. This type of variation makes it difficult to portably transfer text between computer systems.
* UTF-1, the multi-byte Unicode transformation format compatible with ISO/IEC 2022&#x27;s representation of 8-bit control characters, has various disadvantages in comparison with UTF-8, and switching from or to other charsets, as supported by ISO/IEC 2022, is typically unnecessary in Unicode documents.
* Because of its escape sequences, it is possible to construct attack byte sequences in which a malicious string (such as cross-site scripting) is masked until it is decoded to Unicode, which may allow it to bypass sanitisation. Use of this encoding is thus treated as suspicious by malware protection suites, and 7-bit ISO 2022 data (except for ISO-2022-JP) is mapped in its entirety to the replacement character in HTML5 to prevent attacks. Restricted ISO 2022 8-bit code versions which do not use designation escapes or locking shift codes, such as Extended Unix Code, do not share this problem.
* Concatenation can pose issues. Profiles such as ISO-2022-JP specify that the stream starts in the ASCII state and must end in the ASCII state. This is necessary to ensure that characters in concatenated ISO-2022-JP and/or ASCII streams will be interpreted in the correct set. This has the consequence that if a stream that ends in a multi-byte character is concatenated with one that starts with a multi-byte character, a pair of escape codes are generated switching to ASCII and immediately away from it. However, as stipulated in Unicode Technical Report #36 (&quot;Unicode Security Considerations&quot;), pairs of ISO 2022 escape sequences with no characters between them should generate a replacement character (&quot;�&quot;) to prevent them from being used to mask malicious sequences such as cross-site scripting. Implementing this measure, e.g. in Mozilla Thunderbird, has led to interoperability issues, with unexpected &quot;�&quot; characters being generated where two ISO-2022-JP streams have been concatenated.

<text>The Europaturm (&quot;Tower of Europe&quot;) is a high telecommunications tower in Frankfurt, Germany.

== History == 
Designed by architect Erwin Heinle, the tower&#x27;s construction began in 1974. At its completion five years later, it became the tallest free-standing structure in the Federal Republic of Germany. With its height of , Europaturm became Germany&#x27;s second tallest structure, after the Fernsehturm Berlin (). Even without the height of the antenna at its top, the building is over high, which makes it Germany&#x27;s tallest structure by roof level. Its base, at thick, is the widest of any similar structure in the world.

The top of the tower can turn and provides a panoramic view of the Rhine Main area. For a number of years, the upper part of the structure housed a restaurant and discothèque, but since 1999, the Europaturm has been closed to the public.

In September, 2004, the antenna at the top of the tower was replaced, increasing its total height to . The six-ton antenna was lifted to the top in two parts by helicopter.

== Broadcast capability ==

With the new antenna, the tower became capable of broadcasting high-definition digital television signals using the DVB-T standard (which is the European counterpart to the ATSC digital standard used in the United States). It is capable of broadcasting four channels per transmitter, for a total of twenty-four channels, at 100 kilowatts per channel. It is capable of receiving satellite broadcasts and redistributing them via cable or terrestrial broadcasts.

The tower is owned and operated by T-Systems, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. At night, it is illuminated with magenta lighting, the company&#x27;s corporate colours.

Among Frankfurt&#x27;s residents, the tower is colloquially known as the &quot;Ginnemer Spaschel&quot; (Frankfurt dialect for &quot;The Ginnheimer Asparagus&quot;, or &quot;&quot;Ginnheimer Spargel&quot; in standard German), even though it is located in the Bockenheim district rather than close by Ginnheim. It is also simply called the &quot;Fernsehturm&quot;&quot; (&quot;Television Tower&quot;).

== Elevator test tower ==
Since around 2002 a small elevator company has used the tower for testing and demonstrations.

<doc id="493608" wikidata="Q3007751" url="?curid=493608" title="Curse of the Azure Bonds">
<text>Curse of the Azure Bonds is a role-playing video game developed and published by Strategic Simulations in 1989. It is the second in a four-part series of Forgotten Realms &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Gold Box games, continuing the events of &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;.

The game serves as a sequel to the 1988 novel, &quot;Azure Bonds&quot;, that was written by Kate Novak and Jeff Grubb, and is the first book of the &quot;Finder&#x27;s Stone&quot; trilogy. An adventure module of the same name, coded FRC2, was written based on the game.

==Gameplay==
A party of up to six player characters and two non-player characters is required to complete the various quests in the game. Player characters from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; (POR) can be transferred to &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;, although players do not need to have played POR to play this game. Characters can likewise be transferred from &quot;Hillsfar&quot;, another contemporaneous &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;-based game. The paladin and ranger are two new character classes available in this game. A player can generate new characters, choosing the options for each character from six races, nine alignments, two genders, and six character classes. Multi-class characters can be created for half-elf, elf, dwarf, halfling, and gnome characters. New characters begin with 25,000 experience points, which starts single-class characters at level 5. Multi-classed characters have the total number of experience points divided equally amongst their classes, giving either 12,500 or 8,333 experience points, for two or three classes, respectively. This means multi-class characters generally start at level 4, although a triple-classed character would start as a level 3 magic-user. The player can adjust the statistics for any character before beginning the game.

&quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; uses the style from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, with the main adventuring action using a first person perspective. The player uses the top left window to view the current location and move, and can view the status panel on the right and select from the commands along the bottom. Using these commands, the player can select from a range of actions and tasks including casting spells, switching weapons, or resting and preparing spells for the day. The player creates an icon to represent each character, which can be customized to taste.

During combat, the screen display changes so that the right half of the screen becomes the status panel, and the left half shows an overhead view of the combat. Characters can use spells and ranged weapons by lining up their targets.

===Game differences===

&quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; contained new features compared to its predecessor, &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;. The game primarily takes place in the Dalelands, and the overland map allows a player to select an adjacent location and automatically travel there. There are random encounters with monsters when traveling to locations. The player may now choose the classes of paladin and ranger for characters in addition to fighter, thief, magic-user, and cleric. A &quot;Fix&quot; command was added to the &quot;Encamp&quot; menu, which allows a party to be healed very quickly as long as a living and conscious cleric or paladin is in the party. The graphics were improved slightly, though everything was still drawn in 16 colors.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; takes place in the Forgotten Realms setting. The adventure begins in the city of Tilverton, a relatively small town that nonetheless contains sufficient shops and services to equip the party. Although the characters begin the game with no equipment, each character does receive money at the start of the game with which to buy weapons and armor. Outside the city of Tilverton, the characters may explore caverns, sewers, and the wilderness outside. Other locations include the Elven Forest, Zhentil Keep, the temple at Yulash, and the citadel at Hap, though these locations cannot be freely explored by the party. Instead, the player can use a menu to select places within the locations to visit. Yulash is under siege by marauders, and characters entering the town are also in danger from crumbling walls and sinkholes.

===Plot summary===
At the start of the game, the player characters are adventurers of great renown who wake up from a magic sleep to find themselves in a small inn in the city of Tilverton, with all of their possessions stolen and no memory of how it happened. A landlord passing by informs the characters that they have been unconscious for over a month after suffering an attack. Each of the player characters has five azure-colored markings similar to tattoos, called &quot;bonds&quot;, on one arm. The party had been ambushed while traveling on the road to Tilverton. They were taken captive and cursed with the magical bonds embedded on their arms; the quest for the characters is to get rid of these bonds. Characters can visit the sage Filani, who will give them information about the bonds. Each of these bonds represents a separate evil faction, and through the bonds, which glow when active and are the result of a spell with an affect similar to possession, the factions can control the actions of the characters.

The first bond forces the characters to attack the passing royal carriage, resulting in a fight with the royal guards. The characters begin searching for the first controlling faction, a band of assassins known as the Fire Knives. After defeating the Fire Knives which eliminates the first bond, the characters are banished from Tilverton for trying to kill the King. The characters may then journey to Shadowdale or Ashabenford. The player then spends the rest of the game deciding where to go next to remove another bond. As the story continues, the adventurers confront the King of Cormyr and his daughter the princess, save Dimswart the Sage, find three artifacts, and investigate Dagger Falls. Princess Nacacia of Cormyr went missing a year ago, when she fled a marriage that her father arranged, and it is up to the party to find her. The game combines mini-adventures with major adventures in the quest of the party to remove the Azure Bonds. The climax of the game features a battle against an old foe back from the dead.

The remaining four bonds are controlled by Mogion, leader of the cult of Moander, Dracandros the Red Wizard, Fzoul Chembryl and his beholder allies, and Tyranthraxus, the main antagonist from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;. The cult of Moander is based in Yulash, where the characters encounter Alias and Dragonbait, who can join the party. After defeating the cult, the party must also defeat three Bits O&#x27; Moander, which behave as powerful shambling mounds. Dracandros is found in the Red Tower in Haptooth, and the characters will face a beholder in Zhentil Keep, along with a group of minotaurs and a medusa.

After removing two bonds, the player gains the ability to use the &quot;Search&quot; command on the wilderness map to locate mini-dungeons under certain towns; these caverns are dangerous, but the party can gain both experience and treasure in them. When the player has successfully removed four of the bonds, the characters will need to fight Tyranthraxus, who takes the form of a storm giant, in the ruins of Myth Drannor. After defeating Tyranthraxus, the game is over.

==Development==
The game includes a manual to explain its game play, and an &quot;Adventurer&#x27;s Journal&quot; which contains contextual paragraphs intended to be read at specific points during the game. The game also includes a 2-ply code wheel featuring runes for protection against game piracy; on occasion during play, the player will be asked to enter a letter from the wheel before the characters can continue their journey.

&quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; (1989) was the first of three sequels to &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; (1988), and was followed by &quot;Secret of the Silver Blades&quot; (1990) and &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot; (1991). Players of &quot;Secret of the Silver Blades&quot; may begin the game by using characters previously generated in &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;. &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; was released on the Apple II, Commodore 64, and DOS in 1989, the Amiga and Macintosh in 1990, and the Atari ST in 1991. It was distributed in the UK by U.S. Gold. A Nintendo SNES videogame version was planned as a sequel to the NES conversion of &quot;Pool Of Radiance&quot;, but was abandoned; the publisher in both cases was FCI.

The game is linked to both an &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; adventure module and to a novel of the same name. The adventure module is based on the computer game.

==Novel==

The novel &quot;Azure Bonds&quot; is a Forgotten Realms fantasy adventure book, written by Jeff Grubb and Kate Novak and published by TSR in 1988. The story begins with an adventurer named Alias awakening in an inn with amnesia and a set of magical blue sigils on her arm. She soon learns that they represent five evil masters that can control her mind, forcing her to do their owners&#x27; will. With the aid of a mysterious lizard-creature named Dragonbait, a southern mage called Akabar Bel Akash, and a halfling bard named Olive Ruskettle, she sets out to learn more about the sigils&#x27; creators, and free herself of them. It is the first book of the &quot;Finder&#x27;s Stone&quot; trilogy, followed by &quot;The Wyvern&#x27;s Spur&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Song of the Saurials&quot; in 1991.

==Reception==
&quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; was almost as successful as &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, with SSI selling 179,795 copies. More than one third were the Commodore 64 version, benefiting from SSI being the last major American publisher of games for the computer. By 1996, the &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; series had reached combined global sales above 800,000 copies.

In the August 1989 edition of &quot;CU Amiga-64&quot;, Tony Dillon commented that &quot;the graphics are more or less the same as [&quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;], which is no bad thing, and thankfully the game is still as entertaining and involving as the original&quot;. He noted that the game&#x27;s first-person perspective is similar to that of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and also features an overhead view similar to that of &quot;Gauntlet&quot;. He gave the game an excellent overall score of 89%.

In the August 1989 edition of &quot;The Games Machine&quot; (issue 21), Paul Rigby previewed the upcoming release of &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; and noted he had not been happy with &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, which he felt was more like basic &quot;D&amp;D&quot; due to certain classes, spells, and other elements being unavailable. However he believed that &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; would allay his criticism, noting that &quot;six extra character classes, 20 extra high-level spells and a bunch of new monsters make &quot;CAB&quot; a very promising product&quot;. In the following issue of &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, Rigby reviewed the actual game, and confirmed that he considered it to be a dramatic improvement over &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, with introduction of new classes, better storylines, and an improved combat engine. He concluded by giving &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; an excellent overall score of 90%: &quot;Overall, &quot;CAB&quot; is an excellent RPG, much improved and polished over &quot;POR&quot; [...] With a good storyline and excellent graphics, &quot;CAB&quot; is recommended whatever version you have&quot;.

In the September 1989 edition of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; (issue 63), Scorpia reviewed the PC version and was critical of certain elements: she found the ending disappointing; believed that the game speed — which had been slow in &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; — was still a problem; was disappointed that little was added to the game except for the ranger and paladin class; and that the emphasis was still on hack-and-slash as opposed to puzzle-solving and genuine role-playing. Scorpia concluded the review by calling the game a &quot;standard follow-up&quot;, saying it was &quot;better than &quot;POR&quot; in some ways&quot;, but that &quot;combat still predominates&quot;. In a retrospective review in 1993, Scorpia called the game a &quot;sequel to &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; with a bit more plot&quot; and &quot;mainly hack&#x27;n&#x27;slash leading up to the usual &#x27;Kill [the evil villain]&#x27; ending&quot;.

The September 1989 edition of &quot;Zzap&quot; (issue 53) featured a review of the Commodore 64 version. The reviewer felt that the addition of more character classes &quot;allows the player more choice and a lot more scope to create a truly mixed band of adventurers, mirroring the original RPG well&quot;. The reviewer also felt the monsters were better drawn and the game&#x27;s plot had more depth than previous RPGs from SSI, although some innovation was lost because the game is a sequel. However, the reviewer said that &quot;with its intricate plot and superb player interaction &quot;Curse&quot; creates a very strong atmosphere with authenticity lent to the proceedings by the mass of options and the well executed tactical combat display&quot;. The reviewer concluded by giving the game an above-average rating of 86%.

In the September 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (issue 149), Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser found that &quot;both the user&#x27;s manual and the Adventurer&#x27;s Journal [...] are extremely well written&quot;. The pair also admired the number of encounters — more than in other adventure games — and the number of hours required to play, more than 120 hours by their count. They concluded by giving the game a perfect rating of 5 out of 5: &quot;As the adventure continues, you&#x27;ll find that tearing yourself away from &quot;CAB&quot; is the most difficult decision of all&quot;.

In the November 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot;, Jamie Thomson commented that &quot;the plot is good enough, although not that original for games of this kind&quot;, although he liked the role-playing aspects of the game, calling it &quot;a role-playing computer game in one of the purist (&quot;sic&quot;) forms I have yet encountered [...] surprisingly one of the best I have tried (and one of the very few I&#x27;ve had the enery to play to the bitter end)&quot;. Thomson concluded by giving the game above average scores of 4 out of 5 for both game play and graphics.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #18 (Nov./Dec., 1989), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s rare to find a computer game whose depth and size is truly epic and that manages to sustain the player&#x27;s interest over the course of the adventure without becoming repetitive and laborious. &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; manages to do just that. If &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; fell a little short of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;er&#x27;s expectations, &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; more than makes up for it. Truly the best of the official &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; computer games, this product is destined to be a classic.&quot;

In the January 1991 edition of &quot;Amiga Action&quot; (issue 16), Doug Johns and Alex Simmons reviewed the Amiga version of &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;. Johns felt that it was a very good RPG worth getting hold of, although he felt it was a bit too similar to other &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; computer games and less polished than &quot;Champions of Krynn&quot;. Simmons found the game decidedly average and less appealing compared to previous releases such as &quot;Champions of Krynn&quot;, but felt that RPG fanatics who enjoyed SSI&#x27;s other titles should consider purchasing it. They concluded by giving it an average rating of 72%.

In the March 1991 edition of &quot;.info&quot; magazine (issue 37), Judith Kilbury-Cobb reviewed the Amiga version, and felt that the graphics and animation were noticeably improved, and that combat encounters were still emphasized while being made more manageable. She concluded by giving the game an above-average rating of four out of five, calling it &quot;most playable &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game yet&quot;.

The January 1991 edition of &quot;Zzap&quot; reviewed the Amiga version, noting that this version of &quot;Curse&quot; is &quot;a game that has fallen victim to the steady trudge of progress&quot;. The reviewer felt that the game was so dated by 1991 that Amiga &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; devotees might want to buy the game to add it to their collections, but the reviewer could not &quot;help but wonder why SSI have bothered to release this conversion when they should be concentrating on bringing prompt Amiga versions of their newer titles&quot;. The reviewer concluded by giving the game an average rating of 71% overall.

The January 1991 issue of the German gaming magazine &quot;Amiga Joker&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; is once again [&quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot;] at its finest ... the combat is the best thing that the game has to offer, and has lots of variation therein&quot;. The reviewer criticized the small field of view as well as the sound effects and music, which they gave a poor score of 33%. They were frustrated by the dated controls and furthermore criticized its similarity to the rest of the series, saying &quot;the presentation of the game is admittedly the same as its predecessors ... and looks more like C64 rather than Amiga. This goes for the graphics as well as the infrequent sound effects, but applies most of all to the controls, with which one must laboriously agonise through the menus&quot;. The reviewer concluded by giving the Amiga version an average overall score of 74%.

A retrospective article on the website GameSpot titled &quot;History of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; commented that &quot;in terms of gameplay and structure, &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot; followed its predecessor more or less directly, though it broadened the path considerably&quot;. The reviewer mentioned that the game system benefited from material that had been missing from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, such as the ability for clerics and magic-users to attain higher character levels, the ability to enlist characters of paladin and ranger character classes, and the option for human characters to become dual-class characters.

In the 2003 book &quot;High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games&quot;, Rusel DeMaria and Johnny Wilson related that SSI ran into a play balance dilemma by allowing players to import experienced characters from &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;. In order to make the game playable for both beginners and players with built-up characters, the designers had most of the characters&#x27; weapons and equipment stolen at the beginning of the game. SSI received criticism for this decision, and had to come up with new solutions to balance play in future games.

In a retrospective review in 2004, the website &quot;GameSpy&quot; commented that &quot;Azure Bonds&quot; was a worthy addition to the series, and was, in many aspects, superior to its predecessor.

==Awards==
At the 1990 Origins Awards, the game was awarded &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1989&quot;.

<doc id="493609" wikidata="Q215172" url="?curid=493609" title="Chasuble">
<text>The chasuble () is the outermost liturgical vestment worn by clergy for the celebration of the Eucharist in Western-tradition Christian churches that use full vestments, primarily in Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches and in the Eastern Catholic Churches, the equivalent vestment is the phelonion.

&quot;The vestment proper to the priest celebrant at Mass and other sacred actions directly connected with Mass is, unless otherwise indicated, the chasuble, worn over the alb and stole&quot; (&quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot;, 337). Like the stole, it is normally of the liturgical colour of the Mass being celebrated.

== Origins ==

The chasuble originated as a sort of conical poncho, called in Latin a paenula or casula or &quot;little house&quot;, that was the common outer traveling garment in the late Roman Empire. It was simply a roughly oval piece of cloth, with a round hole in the middle through which to pass the head, that fell below the knees on all sides. It had to be gathered up on the arms to allow the arms to be used freely.

In its liturgical use in the West, this garment was folded up from the sides to leave the hands free. Strings were sometimes used to assist in this task, and the deacon could help the priest in folding up the sides of the vestment. Beginning in the 13th century, there was a tendency to shorten the sides a little. In the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, the chasuble took something like its modern form, in which the sides of the vestment no longer reach to the ankle but only, at most, to the wrist, making folding unnecessary.

At the end of the sixteenth century the chasuble, though still quite ample and covering part of the arms, had become less similar to its traditional shape than to that which prevailed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the chasuble was reduced to a broad scapular, leaving the whole of the arms quite free, and was shortened also in front and back. Additionally, to make it easier for the priest to join his hands when wearing a chasuble of stiff (lined and heavily embroidered) material, in these later centuries the front was often cut away further, giving it the distinctive shape often called &quot;fiddleback&quot;. Complex decoration schemes were often used on chasubles of scapular form, especially the back, incorporating the image of the Christian cross or of a saint; and rich materials such as silk, cloth of gold or brocade were employed, especially in chasubles reserved for major celebrations.

== Current usage ==

In the 20th century, there began to be a return to an earlier, more ample, form of the chasuble, sometimes called &quot;Gothic&quot;, as distinguished from the &quot;Roman&quot; scapular form, which is often associated with Traditional Catholicism, especially in circles which celebrate the Tridentine Mass. However, some traditionalist priests prefer ampler chasubles of less stiff material. 
This aroused some opposition, as a result of which the Sacred Congregation of Rites issued on 9 December 1925 a decree against it, &quot;De forma paramentorum&quot; which it explicitly revoked with the declaration &quot;Circa dubium de forma paramentorum&quot; of 20 August 1957, leaving the matter to the prudent judgement of local Ordinaries. There exists a photograph of Pope Pius XI wearing the more ample chasuble while celebrating Mass in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica as early as 19 March 1930.

After the Second Vatican Council, the more ample form became the most usually seen form of the chasuble, and the directions of the GIRM quoted above indicate that &quot;it is fitting&quot; that the beauty should come &quot;not from abundance of overly lavish ornamentation, but rather from the material that is used and from the design. Ornamentation on vestments should, moreover, consist of figures, that is, of images or symbols, that evoke sacred use, avoiding thereby anything unbecoming&quot; (n. 344). Hence, the prevalence today of chasubles that reach almost to the ankles, and to the wrists, and decorated with relatively simple symbols or bands and orphreys. By comparison, &quot;fiddleback&quot; vestments were often extremely heavily embroidered or painted with detailed decorations or whole scenes depicted.

Pope Benedict XVI sometimes used chasubles of the transitional style common at the end of the 16th century.

In the Slavic tradition, though not in the Greek, the phelonion, the Byzantine Rite vestment that corresponds to the chasuble, is cut away from the front and not from the sides, making it look somewhat like the western cope.

== In Catholicism ==
Called in Latin &quot;casula&quot;, &quot;planeta&quot; or &quot;pænula&quot;, and in early Gallic sources &quot;amphibalus&quot;. The chasuble is the principal and most conspicuous Mass vestment, covering all the rest. It is described in prayer as the &quot;yoke of Christ&quot; and said to represent charity. Nearly all ecclesiologists are now agreed that liturgical costume was simply an adaptation of the secular attire commonly worn throughout the Roman Empire in the early Christian centuries. The priest in discharging his sacred functions at the altar was dressed as in civil life, but the custom probably grew up of reserving for this purpose garments that were newer and cleaner than those used in his daily ministry, and out of this gradually developed the conception of a special liturgical attire.

== In Protestantism ==

Many, but not all, Lutheran and Anglican churches make use of the chasuble. 

The chasuble has always been used by the Lutheran denominations of Scandinavia, although in earlier times its use was not directly connected to the communion. German Lutherans used it for the first two hundred years after the Reformation but later replaced it with the Geneva Gown. A variety of practices emerged in North America but by the mid-20th century, the alb and stole became widely customary. More recently, the chasuble has been readopted for Communion services in both Germany and North America.

It is the stole, not the chasuble, that is the priestly vestment. 
The chasuble was never used by low-church Anglicans and rarely used by high-church Anglicans until the Oxford Movement in the 19th century, and even then not until the second generation of the Oxford Movement.

It is not customary and rarely seen in Protestantism outside of the liturgical churches.

== In popular culture ==
In Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1895 play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, Dr. Chasuble is a clergyman who, in the 2002 film adaptation, is seen wearing his namesake vestment.

In P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s comic short story Mulliner&#x27;s Buck-U-Uppo, Anglican cleric Stanley Brandon is in &quot;a very bad temper.&quot; &quot;He has just had a letter from the bishop, rebuking him for wearing too many orphreys on his chasuble, and it has upset him terribly.&quot;

<doc id="493615" wikidata="Q794586" url="?curid=493615" title="Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma">
<text>The Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma is a four-bladed, twin-engined medium transport/utility helicopter designed and originally produced by the French aerospace manufacturer Sud Aviation.

The Puma was developed as a new design during the mid-1960s in response to a French Army requirement for a medium-sized all-weather utility helicopter. Powered by a pair of Turbomeca Turmo turboshaft engines, it was designed to transport up to 16 seated soldiers, or a maximum of six litters with four attendants for casualty evacuation, along with carrying up to 2,500 kg of cargo either internally or using an external sling. The design of the Puma incorporated several innovations, including an automatic blade inspection system and relatively advanced anti-vibration measures integrated into the main gearbox and main rotor blades. It was also designed to be capable of operating at night, under inhospitable flying conditions and in climates from Arctic to desert. The Puma also has an intentionally high level of reserve power to permit effective flight even at its maximum weight with only a single operational engine.

On 15 April 1965, the first prototype performed its maiden flight; the first production standard Puma made its first flight during September 1968. Deliveries to the French Army commenced in early 1969; the type quickly proved itself to be a commercial success. Production of the Puma continued into the 1980s under Sud Aviation&#x27;s successor company Aérospatiale. It was also license-produced in Romania as the IAR 330; two unlicensed derivatives, the Denel Rooivalk attack helicopter and Atlas Oryx utility helicopter, were built in South Africa. Several advanced derivatives have been developed, such as the AS332 Super Puma and AS532 Cougar, and have been manufactured by Eurocopter and its successor company Airbus Helicopters since the early 1990s. These descendants of the Puma remain in production.

Significant operations include the Gulf War, the South African Border War, the Portuguese Colonial War, the Yugoslav Wars, the Lebanese Civil War, the Iraq War, and the Falklands War. Numerous operators have chosen to modernise their fleets, often adding more capabilities and new features, such as glass cockpits, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation, and defense measures. The type also saw popular use in the civilian field and has been operated by a number of civil operators. One of the largest civil operators of the Puma was Bristow Helicopters, which regularly used it for off shore operations over the North Sea.

==Development==
The SA 330 Puma was originally developed by Sud Aviation to meet a requirement of the French Army for a medium-sized all-weather helicopter capable of carrying up to 20 soldiers as well as various cargo-carrying duties. The choice was made to develop a new design for the helicopter, work began in 1963 with backing from the French government. The first of two Puma prototypes flew on 15 April 1965; six further pre-production models were also built, the last of which flew on 30 July 1968. The first production SA 330 Puma flew in September 1968, with deliveries to the French Army starting in early 1969.
In 1967, the Puma was selected by the Royal Air Force (RAF), who were impressed by the Puma&#x27;s performance. It was given the designation &quot;Puma HC Mk 1&quot;. A significant joint manufacturing agreement was signed between Aerospatiale and Westland Helicopters of the UK. The close collaboration between the French and British firms would lead to purchases of Aérospatiale Gazelle by the UK and the Westland Lynx by France. Under this agreement, Westland manufactured a range of components and performed the assembly of Pumas ordered by the RAF.

The SA 330 was a success on the export market, numerous countries purchased military variants of the Puma to serve in their armed forces; the type was also popularly received in the civil market, finding common usage by operators for transport duties to off-shore oil platforms. Throughout most of the 1970s, the SA 330 Puma was the best selling transport helicopter being produced in Europe. By July 1978, over 50 Pumas had already been delivered to civil customers, and the worldwide fleet had accumulated in excess of 500,000 operational hours.

Romania entered into an arrangement with Aerospatiale to produce the Puma under license as the IAR 330, manufacturing at least 163 of the type for the Romanian armed forces, civil operators, and several export customers of their own. Indonesia also undertook domestic manufacturing of the SA 330. South Africa, a keen user of the type, performed their own major modification and production program conducted by the government-owned Atlas Aircraft Corporation to upgrade their own Pumas, the resulting aircraft was named Oryx. In the 1990s, Denel would also develop an attack helicopter for the South African Air Force based on the Puma, known as the Denel Rooivalk.

In 1974, Aerospatiale began development of improved Puma variants, aiming to produce a successor to the type; these efforts would cumulate in the AS332 Super Puma. The first prototype AS332 Super Puma took flight on 13 September 1978, featuring more powerful engines and a more aerodynamically efficient extended fuselage; by 1980, production of the AS332 Super Puma had overtaken that of the originating SA 330 Puma. Production of the SA 330 Puma by Aérospatiale ceased in 1987, by which time a total of 697 had been sold; production in Romania would continue into the 21st Century.

==Design==

The Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma is a twin-engine helicopter principally intended for personnel transport and logistic support duties. As a troop carrier, up to 16 soldiers can be accommodated on foldable seats, while in a casualty evacuation configuration, the same cabin can hold up to six litters and four additional personnel. The Puma can also perform cargo transport duties, either via the external carriage of underslung payloads on a dedicated cargo hook or using the internal cabin space; up to a maximum weight of 2500 kg of cargo can be carried at a time. Civilian Pumas feature a variety of cabin layouts, typically intended for various forms of passenger transport, including VIPs. In a search and rescue capacity, a hoist is commonly installed, often mounted on the starboard fuselage.

A pair of roof-mounted Turbomeca Turmo turboshaft engines power the Puma&#x27;s four-blade main rotor. The rotors are driven via a five reduction stage transmission at a typical speed of 265 rpm. The design of the transmission featured several unique and uncommon innovations for the time, such as single-part manufacturing of the rotor shaft and the anti-vibration measures integrated into the main gearbox and main rotor blades. The Puma also featured an automatic blade inspection system, which guarded against and alerted crews to fatigue cracking in the rotor blades. It is furnished with a pair of hydraulic systems that intentionally operate independently of one another, one system powering only the aircraft&#x27;s flight controls while the other serves the autopilot, undercarriage, and rotor brake, as well as the flight controls.

In terms of flight performance, the Puma was designed to be capable of high speeds, exhibit great maneuverability, and possess favourable hot-and-high performance; the engines have an intentionally high level of reserve power to enable a Puma to fly effectively even at maximum weight with only one functioning engine and proceed with its mission if circumstances require. The cockpit is provisioned with conventional dual controls for both a pilot and copilot, a third seat is provided in the cockpit for a reserve crew member or commander. The Puma features a SFIM-Newmark Type 127 electro-hydraulic autopilot; the autopilot is capable of roll and pitch stabilization, the load hook operator can also directly perform corrective adjustments of the helicopter&#x27;s position from their station via the autopilot.

The Puma is readily air-transportable by tactical airlifters, such as the Transall C-160 and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules; the main rotor, landing gear, and tailboom are all detachable to lower space requirements. Ease of maintenance was one of the objectives pursued in the Puma&#x27;s design; many of the components and systems that would require routine inspection were positioned to be visible from ground level, use of life-limited components was minimised, and key areas of the mechanical systems were designed to be readily accessed. The Puma is also capable of operating at nighttime, in inhospitable flying conditions, or in a wide range of climates from Arctic to desert environments.

Although not included during the original production run, numerous operators of Pumas have installed additional features and modern equipment over the rotorcraft&#x27;s service life. The RAF have equipped their Puma fleet with Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation equipment, along with an assortment of self-defense measures including infrared countermeasures and automatic flares/chaff dispensers, and night vision goggles for night-time flights. The French Army Light Aviation have modernised their Pumas to meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards, this involved the addition of new digital systems, including mission command and control systems, such as the Sitalat data link. Third-party companies such as South Africa&#x27;s Thunder City have provided life extension and modernisation programmes for the Puma, some operators have opted to refurbish their fleets with glass cockpits.

==Operational history==

===Argentina===
During the Falklands War/Guerra de Malvinas of 1982, five SA 330 Pumas of the Argentine Army and one of the Argentine Coast Guard were deployed to the theatre; these could either operate from the decks of Navy vessels as well as performing missions across the breadth of the islands; all were lost in the ensuing conflict. On 3 April, while landing Argentine troops as part of the capture of South Georgia, a Puma was badly damaged by small arms fire from British ground forces and crashed into terrain shortly after. On 9 May, a single Puma was destroyed by a Sea Dart anti-aircraft missile launched from .

On 23 May, a pair of Royal Navy Sea Harriers intercepted three Argentine Pumas in the middle of a supply mission to Port Howard; during the subsequent engagement one Puma was destroyed by colliding with the terrain and a second was disabled and subsequently destroyed by cannon fire from the Sea Harriers, the third Puma escaped. On 30 May, a Puma was lost in the vicinity of Mount Kent under unclear circumstances, possibly due to friendly fire; an article in the Argentine newssite MercoPress reported that, on that same day, a Puma had been brought down by a Stinger missile fired by the SAS ground forces, near Mount Kent. Six National Gendarmerie Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded in the downing.

===France===
In September 1979, four Pumas were employed during Operation Barracuda to transport a French assault team directly upon the government headquarters of the Central African Empire; after which confiscated valuables and assorted diplomatic and political records were quickly extracted to the nearby French embassy by continuous air lifts by the Pumas.

One distinctive use of the Puma in French service was as a VIP transport for carrying the President of France both at home and during overseas diplomatic engagements; these duties were transferred to the larger AS332 Super Puma as that became available in sufficient numbers.
During the 1991 First Gulf War, France chose to dispatch several Pumas in support of coalition forces engaged in a conflict with Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq. Those Pumas that had been assigned to the role of performing combat search-and-rescue duties were quickly retrofitted with GPS receivers to enhance their navigational capabilities.

As part of France&#x27;s contribution to the 1990s NATO-led intervention in the Yugoslav Wars, a number of French Pumas operated in the region alongside other Puma operators such as Britain and the United Arab Emirates; one frequent mission for the type was the vital provision of humanitarian aid missions to refugees escaping ongoing ethnic genocide. In April 1994, a French Puma performed a nighttime extraction of a British SAS squad and a downed Sea Harrier pilot from deep inside hostile Bosnian territory, the aircraft came under small arms fire while retreating from the area. On 18 June 1999, a single coordinated aerial insertion of two companies of French paratroopers was performed by 20 Pumas, helping to spearhead the rapid securing of Kosovska Mitrovica by NATO ground forces.

By 2010, both the French Army and French Navy have opted to procure separate variants of the NHIndustries NH90 to ultimately replace the Puma in French military service. Starting in June 2014, a pair of Pumas of &quot;Escadron d&#x27;Hélicoptères 1/67 &#x27;Pyrénées&quot; (EH 1/60) were deployed to Chad and Niger from June 2014 as part of Operation Barkhane to disrupt Islamist insurgency in the Sahel region. Initially operated from N&#x27;Djamena in Chad, the detachment later moved forwards to Dirkou and Madama in Niger, supporting ground troops and interdicting supply routes for the insurgent; the detachment returned to France in September 2015 after being relieved by other French Army assets. Roughly 20 SA 330 Pumas remained in French Air and Space Force service by 2016.

===Lebanon===

Between 1980 and 1984, the Lebanese Air Force received from France ten SA 330C Pumas to equip its newly raised 9th transport squadron at Beirut Air Base, where it was initially based. In 1983, the squadron was relocated north of Beirut and its Pumas were dispersed across small improvised helipads around Jounieh and Adma for security reasons. On 23 August 1984, a Puma carrying the Lebanese Armed Forces&#x27; Chief-of-staff and commander of the Seventh Brigade, General Nadim al-Hakim, and eight other senior military officers crashed in thick fog near Beirut, killing all personnel aboard. On 1 June 1987, the Lebanese Prime-Minister Rachid Karami was assassinated aboard a Puma en route to Beirut when a bomb exploded in an attaché case on his lap; the explosion also injured Interior Minister Abdullah Rassi and three of the other twelve aides and crewmen on the Puma, which was severely damaged.

During the final phase of the Lebanese Civil War, the Puma fleet – now reduced to seven or six helicopters of flightworthy condition – was typically being used to conduct liaison flights with neighboring Cyprus on behalf of General Michel Aoun&#x27;s interim military government, although fuel shortages and maintenance problems forced their crews to typically ground them until the end of the war in October 1990.

After the conflict, the Lebanese Air Force Command made consistent efforts to rebuild its transport helicopter squadron with the help of the United Arab Emirates and seven IAR 330 SM helicopters formerly in service with the United Arab Emirates Air Force were delivered in 2010.

In 2013, the Lebanese Air Force converted an IAR 330 SM into a helicopter gunship by mounting on hardened side-swivel mounts a single ADEN Mk 4/5 30mm revolver cannon on a modified pod and a pair of SNEB 68mm rocket launchers taken from decommissioned Hawker Hunter FGA.70 and FGA.70A fighter aircraft. Re-designated SA 330SM, the resulting Puma gunship underwent trials on October 10 that same year during aerial maneuvers held in Hamat Air Base. Although the trials were successful, the SA 300SM was not accepted for active service, with the Lebanese Air Force Command settling instead on an armed version of the Eurocopter AS532 Cougar, of which seven helicopters were scheduled to be received over the next three years.

===Morocco===

In 1974, Morocco made an agreement with France for the purchase of 40 Puma helicopters for their armed forces. During the 1970s and 1980s, Moroccan Pumas saw combat service against Polisario Front separatists and helped exert greater control over the Western Sahara region; use of air power by Moroccan forces was severely curtailed after several aircraft were lost or damaged due to the presence of Soviet-provided 2K12 Kub anti-aircraft missiles in rebel hands in the early 1980s.

In October 2007, as part of a €2 billion deal between Morocco and France, a total of 25 Moroccan Pumas are to undergo extensive modernisation and upgrades.

===Portugal===
In 1969, Portugal emerged as an early export customer for the Puma, ordering 12 of the helicopters for the Portuguese Air Force; Portugal would also be the first country to employ the Pumas in combat operations during the Portuguese Colonial War; the type was used operationally to complement the smaller Alouette III helicopter fleet during the Angola and Mozambican wars of independence, the type had the advantages of greater autonomy and transport capacity over other operated helicopters.

During the 1980s, Portugal engaged in an illicit arrangement with South Africa in order to circumvent a United Nations embargo being enforced upon South Africa under which France had refused to provide upgrades and spares for South Africa&#x27;s own Puma fleet. In the secretive deal, Portugal ordered more powerful engines and new avionics with the public intention of employing them on its own Pumas, however many of the components were diverted via a Zaire-based front company to South African defense firm Armscorp, where they were used to overhaul, upgrade and rebuild the existing Pumas, ultimately resulting in the Atlas Oryx; the Portuguese Pumas also received significant upgrades which were paid for under the terms of the agreement.

In 2006, the Portuguese Air Force began receiving deliveries of the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, a larger and more capable helicopter, replacing the aging Puma fleet.

Starting in 2007, Portugal has been offering to sell eight of its withdrawn Pumas, they were still on sale by 2015.

===South Africa===
From 1972 onwards, Pumas operated by the SAAF were deployed on extended operations in South West Africa and Angola during the Border War. The Puma was involved in normal trooping; rapid deployment during &quot;follow up&quot; operations; acting as radio relays; evacuation of casualties; rescuing downed aircrew; insertion of Special Forces; and large scale cross border operations such as Savannah, Uric, Protea, Super, and Modular. The majority of South African Puma acquisitions, including of spare parts, were made in advance of an anticipated United Nations embargo that was applied in 1977. South Africa subsequently upgraded many of its Pumas, eventually arriving at the derived indigenous Atlas Oryx; external assistance and components were obtained via secretive transactions involving Portugal during the arms embargo era.

In December 1979, South Africa&#x27;s government acknowledged the presence of its military forces operating in Rhodesia; Pumas were routinely used in support of the South African Army&#x27;s ground forces. In June 1980, 20 Pumas accompanied a force of 8,000 troops during a South African invasion of Angola in pursuit of nationalist SWAPO fighters. In 1982, the government confirmed that 15 servicemen had been killed when a South African Puma was downed by SWAPO forces, it was one of the worst losses suffered in a single incident in the conflict.

During the 1990s, clandestine efforts to purchase surplus SAAF Pumas were made by then-President Pascal Lissouba of the Republic of Congo, most likely intended for use in the Congolese Civil War. When the cruise ship sank off the Wild Coast of South Africa in 1991, as many as 13 Pumas played crucial roles in the rescue efforts, winching 225 survivors to safety during bad weather conditions.

===United Kingdom===

The first two Pumas for the Royal Air Force were delivered on 29 January 1971, with the first operational squadron (33 Squadron) forming at RAF Odiham on 14 June 1971. The RAF would order a total of 48 Puma HC Mk 1 for transport duties; during the Falklands War, an additional SA 330J formerly operated by Argentine Naval Prefecture was captured by British forces and shipped back to Britain and used as a RAF static training aid for several years. This SA 330J was later refurbished by Westland using parts from damaged RAF Puma XW215 and put into RAF service after a lengthy rebuild as ZE449. The Puma became a common vehicle for British special forces, such as the SAS, and has been described as being &quot;good for covert tasks&quot;.

Between the early 1970s and the 1990s, RAF Pumas were normally based at RAF Odiham (33 Squadron and 240 OCU), RAF Gutersloh (230 Squadron) and No. 1563 Flight RAF at RAF Belize. During The Troubles, it was also common for a detachment to be based at RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland. In 1994, 230 Squadron relocated to RAF Aldergrove to provide a permanent presence to augment the Westland Wessex of 72 Squadron. In 2009, 230 Squadron relocated to RAF Benson together with 33 Squadron from RAF Odiham.
Royal Air Force Pumas have also seen active service in Venezuela, Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Zaire. Britain has frequently dispatched Pumas on disaster relief and humanitarian missions, such as during the 2000 Mozambique flood and the 1988 Jamaican flash flood; and to conduct peacekeeping operations in regions such as Zimbabwe and the Persian Gulf.

During the climax of the First Gulf War, a joint force of Pumas from 230 and 33 Squadrons proved decisive in rapidly mobilizing and deploying troops to prevent Iraqi troops from sabotaging the Rumaila oil field. From the beginning of the Iraq War, between 2003 and 2009, RAF Pumas would be used to provide troop mobility across the theatre. On 15 April 2007, two RAF Pumas collided during a special forces mission close to Baghdad, Iraq. In November 2007, a Puma crashed during an anti-insurgent operation in Iraq; an inquest found the cause to be pilot error primarily, however the Ministry of Defence (MoD) was criticised for failing to equip RAF Pumas with night vision goggles and inadequate maintenance checks compromising safety, these shortcomings were addressed following the incident.

In 2002, six ex-South African SA 330L were purchased by Britain to extend the type&#x27;s service life. An extensive upgrade programme saw the first Puma HC Mk2 enter service in late 2012 and completion in early 2014, permitting the RAF&#x27;s Pumas to stay in service until 2025. In 2008, it was planned for 30 Pumas to be upgraded, this was subsequently cut to 22, and was later revised upwards for a total of 24 HC Mk2 Pumas. Upgrades include the adoption of two Turbomeca Makila engines, new gearboxes and tail rotors, new engine controls, digital autopilot, a flight management system, an improved defensive aids suite, and ballistic protection for both crew and passengers. The HC Mk2 Puma can transport double the payload over three times the range of its predecessor, and has been deployed for tactical troop transport, fast contingent combat, and humanitarian missions.

RAF Pumas will cease flying on 31 March 2025 and withdrawn from service, the replacement rotorcraft being procured under the New Medium Helicopter programme.

===Private military companies===
The American private military company EP Aviation is known to have operated numerous Pumas in Afghanistan.

===Civil===
One of the largest and prominent operators of the type was Bristow Helicopters, where the Puma was regularly used for off shore operations over the North Sea. During the 1970s, Bristow had sought to begin replacing their Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, and the Puma was selected after a highly competitively-priced bid had been made by Aerospatiale; Puma G-BFSV was the first of the type to enter service with Bristow. From 1979 onwards, the Puma formed the mainstay of the Bristow fleet; the type took over the duties of Bristow&#x27;s retiring Westland Wessex helicopters in 1981. In 1982, Bristow opted to supplement their then-total fleet of 11 SA 330J Pumas via the introduction the more powerful Super Puma.

The American operator Erickson Inc. has operated at least four Pumas; they have been used under contract for Vertical replenishment (VERTREP) to the United States Fifth Fleet and United States Seventh Fleet.

<text>James Louis Oberstar (September 10, 1934 – May 3, 2014) was an American politician and Congressman who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 2011. Hailing from Minnesota and a member of the state&#x27;s local Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, he represented the northeastern eighth congressional district, which included the cities of Duluth, Brainerd, Grand Rapids, International Falls, and Hibbing, within an area of Minnesota known as the Iron Range. He chaired the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee from 2007 until his departure, having been the ranking minority member since 1995. In November 2010, he was defeated by a margin of 4,407 votes by Republican Chip Cravaack. He had the longest tenure of any Congressman from Minnesota.

==Early life, education and career==
Oberstar was born in Chisholm, Minnesota, and on his deathbed, he still owned his original family home in Chisholm. His father Louis, of German ancestry, was an iron ore miner and the first card-carrying member of the United Steelworkers (USW) on the Iron Range of Minnesota. Oberstar also has Slovenian ancestry.

Oberstar graduated from Chisholm High School in 1952 and went on to the College of St. Thomas (now the University of St. Thomas) in St. Paul, Minnesota where he received his B.A. degree in 1956. He received a master&#x27;s degree in European Studies from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium in 1957, with further study at Université Laval in Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

He spent four years as a civilian language teacher in the United States Marine Corps, teaching English to Haitian military personnel and French to American Marine officers and noncommissioned officers.

He served on the staff of Minnesota&#x27;s 8th District U.S. Representative John Blatnik for 12 years, from 1963 to 1974, rising to chief of staff. He was also the administrator of the Committee on Public Works for the U.S. House of Representatives from 1971 to 1974.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Oberstar was an internationally recognized expert on aviation and aviation safety. He served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee during his entire time in the House. (His predecessor Blatnik had chaired the committee, then known as the Public Works Committee, during his last two terms in Congress, with Oberstar as staff administrator.) He was also a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism.

In 1965, Oberstar helped create the Economic Development Administration, the only federal agency devoted to the creation and retention of jobs in economically distressed American communities.

Oberstar was a strong supporter of the Duluth-based aircraft manufacturer Cirrus Aircraft and even helped bring the company to Minnesota in 1994 from its first home in Baraboo, Wisconsin. That same year, he assisted in passing the General Aviation Revitalization Act, which was said to have reinvigorated the general aviation industry nationwide.
An avid cyclist, Oberstar championed the creation of trails for cycling and hiking to promote active lifestyles. In 2005, he authored, co-sponsored, and helped to pass the SAFETEA-LU act, a $295 billion program that funded transportation infrastructure, including highways, bridges, and public transportation, such as subways, buses, and passenger ferries and which includes the Safe Routes to Schools program. At the 2007 BikeWalk California conference and other bicycling conferences, Oberstar advocated converting the U.S.&#x27;s transportation system &quot;from a hydrocarbon-based system to a carbohydrate-based system.&quot;

He was rated the third most liberal member of the Minnesota delegation in the 109th Congress, scored at 13% by a conservative group and 86% progressive by a liberal group.

Along with John Conyers, in April 2006, Oberstar brought an action against George W. Bush and others alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution in the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The case, (&quot;Conyers v. Bush&quot;), was ultimately dismissed.

Within days after the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge, Oberstar introduced and succeeded in passing legislation to appropriate $250 million to the Minnesota Department of Transportation to quickly build a replacement bridge.

In 2004, Oberstar led the opposition to the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004, a bill that established a regulatory framework for private suborbital spaceflight, arguing that the bill did not sufficiently safeguard passenger and crew safety. &quot;I do not want to see people dead from a space experiment, and then the federal government comes in to regulate&quot;.

During his tenure in Congress, Oberstar held leadership positions on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, was House Democratic At-Large Whip, and was a member of the executive committee of the Democratic Study Group. He also served on the International Relations Committee. He was co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force and was a member of the Upper Mississippi Task Force and the Democratic Homeland Security Task Force. He co-chaired the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus and was a member of the following caucuses: the Bike Caucus; the Caucus for Sustainable Development; the Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety; the Congressional Human Rights Caucus; the Congressional Steel Caucus; the Medical Technology Caucus; the Mississippi River Caucus; the Native American Caucus; and the Renewable Energy Caucus.

==Political positions==

=== Social Issues ===
Oberstar was an anti-abortion Democrat, and believed it should only be allowed if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, or if the life of the mother was endangered. He sponsored multiple constitutional amendments to enshrine a right to life provision, and to prohibit abortion services unless the mother&#x27;s life was in danger.

One of his first congressional achievements was the passage of an amendment in 1976 to prohibit federal funding of the procedure. While the amendment, known as the Hyde Amendment, was officially introduced by fellow freshman member Henry Hyde (R-IL), Oberstar formulated the text himself, handwriting it on a slip of paper; due to the appeal of a Republican co-sponsor, and Hyde&#x27;s seat on the House Judiciary Committee, it was determined the amendment would have an easier chance of passing if Hyde introduced it. Prohibition of federal funding of abortion services, through the amendment, was one of the first legislative gains made by the anti-abortion movement after the Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide.

He voted in 2003 to ban intact dilation and extraction, also known as &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot;, and was present at the bill&#x27;s signing by President George W. Bush. He showed his full support in 2005–2006 to the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC). Oberstar voted against legislation in 2005 to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to research embryonic stem cells, and again in 2007, one of the only 14 and 16 Democratic members respectively to do so. He co-chaired the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, along with Republican Chris Smith of New Jersey.

Oberstar supported the bill to move the Terri Schiavo case to federal court, and appeared at a press conference with then-House Majority leader Tom DeLay to urge its passage.

During his congressional tenure, Oberstar had a generally supportive record on LGBT rights. The Defense of Marriage Act passed in 1996 with the support of 118 House Democratic members, including Oberstar. However, after that vote he started to vote more in line with LGBT advocacy groups, such as the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which gave him ratings of 86%, 88%, 69%, and 88% for the 108-111th Congress&#x27;. He voted in favor of making crimes motivated by discrimination against sexual orientation or gender identity a federal hate crime in 2009, and cosponsored a bill in 2003 to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

=== Economic Issues ===
Oberstar was a strong supporter of the Head Start Program, a national program from to promote school readiness by enhancing social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services. He considered it to be one of the most successful federal anti-poverty programs ever created. Oberstar also supported the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has been a leading voice promoting education and equality for women and girls nationwide; he fully supported the AAUW in 2007 and 2008. Interest groups, like the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), scored him at 100/100. In the early 1980s, Oberstar gave federal aid to the establishment of the Natural Resources Research Institute at the University of Minnesota Duluth to provide applied research and technology development to Minnesota&#x27;s natural resource-based economy.

Oberstar was rated 100 by Environment America and the League of Conservation Voters in 2009. The American Wind Energy Association also gave him a rating of 100 in 2006. He voted to pass the Energy and Environmental Law Amendments, which aimed to establish a program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in 2009. He also voted to pass a bill, Trade-in Vouchers for Fuel-Efficient Cars, in 2009, which granted a $3,500 voucher for trading in an old vehicle for one that got least 4 miles per gallon more, to increase the purchase of fuel-efficient cars. However, Oberstar went against most Democrats and voted in favor of allowing drilling in ANWR.

Oberstar was a strong supporter of organized labor. He was given an 100% rating by the AFL-CIO. Oberstar was also rated 92 by the American Federation of Government Employees in 2009 and 90 by Federally Employed Women in 2009. He voted for three unemployment benefits extension bills in 2010 and three Employment Discrimination Law Amendments in 2009.

According to the Minnesota Congressional Election 2008 Political Courage Test, Oberstar supported having taxation of corporate earnings, gasoline, and cigarettes. In 2008, Americans For Fair Taxation (AFFT) gave Oberstar their lowest possible rating, and the National Taxpayers Union gave Oberstar an &quot;F&quot;. He supported a tax plan containing tax relief for working families, investment tax credits for small businesses, and support for the states, including incentives for transportation construction projects that would immediately put people back to work. Oberstar did not support free trade agreements, such as North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). He believed that free trade under NAFTA and CAFTA offered little or no economic opportunity for American workers and producers due to inadequate provisions in the agreements.

==Political campaigns==
When John Blatnik opted not to run for a 15th term in 1974, he endorsed Oberstar as his successor. Oberstar won and was reelected 16 times without serious difficulty. Democrats Blatnik and Oberstar held the seat from 1947 until 2011. Oberstar&#x27;s lowest winning percentage was 59 percent in 1992, but after that, until 2010, he did not earn less than 60 percent of the vote. He is the longest-serving member of either house of Congress in Minnesota&#x27;s history, having served in the 94th through the 111th Congresses from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 2011.
During the 2006 elections, Oberstar&#x27;s Republican opponent was former United States Senator Rod Grams, whose lived in the southwestern corner of the 8th. Grams was the first reasonably well-funded Republican to run in the 8th in decades. Although some polls showed Oberstar only ahead by two points, in the end, he won by over 30 points and did not lose a single county in his district.

During the 2008 elections, Oberstar&#x27;s Republican opponent was political neophyte and businessman Michael Cummins. Cummins campaigned throughout the district but did not drum up enough support to pose a serious challenge to the veteran Democratic incumbent. Oberstar won with more than 67 percent of the vote. During the 2008 campaign, Oberstar appeared alongside other public officials in a TV ad supporting the reelection of Puerto Rico Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, a fellow Democrat.

During the 2010 elections, Oberstar lost a close race to political newcomer and Tea Party favorite Chip Cravaack, who won a plurality of 48 percent of the vote. The race was seen nationwide as a major upset for Democrats.

==Awards and honors==

In 2009, Oberstar received the Tony Jannus Award for distinguished leadership in commercial aviation.

In May 2011, a Great Lakes ore carrier, of the Interlake Steamship Company, which typically transports taconite pellets from Duluth, Silver Bay and Marquette to steel mills near Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago, was renamed after him, dubbed the &quot;MV Honorable James L. Oberstar&quot;.

On June 19, 2012, Oberstar was made Commander in the French &quot;Ordre national du Mérite&quot;.

In October 2015, the new passenger terminal of the Duluth International Airport was named in honor of Oberstar, who helped secure funding for the facility before its 2013 opening. A sculpture of him was also unveiled during the renamed terminal&#x27;s introduction.

In 2016, he was posthumously inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame.

<doc id="493618" wikidata="Q4626" url="?curid=493618" title="Kölsch (beer)">
<text> () is a style of beer originating in Cologne (Köln), Germany. In appearance, it is bright and clear with a straw-yellow hue. Kölsch is a top-fermenting beer. 

Since 1997, the term &quot;Kölsch&quot; has had a protected geographical indication (PGI) within the European Union, indicating a beer that is made within of the city of Cologne and brewed according to the &quot;Kölsch Konvention&quot; as defined by the members of the Cologne Brewery Association (Kölner Brauerei-Verband). Kölsch is one of the most strictly defined beer styles in Germany: according to the Konvention, it is a pale, highly attenuated, hoppy, bright (i.e. filtered and not cloudy) top-fermenting beer, and must be brewed according to the . It has an original gravity between 11 and 14 degrees Plato (specific gravity of 1.044 to 1.056). 

Kölsch is warm fermented with top-fermenting yeast, then conditioned at cold temperatures like a lager. This brewing process is similar to that used for Düsseldorf&#x27;s .

==History==

Bottom-fermented beer started to appear in the Cologne region in the early 17th century and its popularity threatened the business interest of the brewers of Cologne, who only produced top-fermented beers. In response, the town council of Cologne in 1603 forced young brewers to swear an oath &quot;that you prepare your beer, as of old, from good malt, good cereals, and good hops, well-boiled, and that you pitch it with top-yeast, and by no means with bottom yeast.&quot; In 1676 and again in 1698, the council again tried to legislate against bottom-fermented beer by forbidding its sale within the city walls. However, by 1750, Cologne brewers were competing against bottom-fermented beers by using a hybridized brewing process, first brewing their beer using top-fermenting yeast but then aging the beer in cold cellars like bottom-fermented beer.

This type of beer was first called in 1918 to describe the beer that had been brewed by the Sünner brewery since 1906, developed from the similar but cloudier variant (for &quot;white&quot; in the Kölsch dialect). By the start of World War II Cologne had more than forty breweries; only two were left by the end of the war.

In 1946, many of the breweries managed to re-establish themselves. In the 1940s and 1950s, still could not match the sales of bottom-fermented beer, but in the 1960s the style began to rise in popularity in the Cologne beer market. From a production of only in 1960, Cologne&#x27;s beer production peaked at in 1980. In the 21st century, price increases and changing drinking habits caused economic hardship for many of the traditional corner bars () and smaller breweries, and by 2005 output had declined to .

In 1986, 24 brewers of Cologne and vicinity agreed upon the &quot;Kölsch Konvention&quot;, which set out the brewing process that had to be used, and restricted the use of &quot;Kölsch&quot; to breweries in Cologne, and outside the city, which had already acquired a valuable asset in the designation &quot;Kölsch&quot; before the Convention came into force. 
Only two breweries later produce beer according to the Kölsch Konvention, Hellers from Cologne (opened 1991) and the Bischoff-Brauerei from Brühl (opened 1961, reopened 2001). Most of the brand on the list are still available, because another brewery took over the brand. 

Many breweries closed in the years that followed. Only six of the breweries listed are still active, Früh, Gaffel, Reissdorf (the big three), Erzquell, Päffgen and Malzmühle – after Malzmühle announced it will take over Sünner in 2022. Once-famous brands such as Dom, Küppers and Sion are now owned by the Radeberger Gruppe, which no longer has a brewery in Cologne. They are contract brewed at Früh so that the beer can still be called Kölsch. 

In 1997, became a product with protected geographical indication (PGI), expanding this protection to the entire EU. 

Exports of to the United States, Russia, Korea, China and Brazil are increasing. Exported does not need to strictly comply with the Provisional German Beer Law, the current implementation of the Reinheitsgebot.

==Serving==

In Cologne, is traditionally served in a tall, thin, cylindrical glass called a (&quot;pole&quot; or &quot;rod&quot;). The server, called a , carries eleven or twelve &quot;Stangen&quot; in a &quot;Kranz&quot; (&quot;wreath&quot;), a circular tray resembling a crown or wreath. Instead of waiting for the drinker to order a refill, the &quot;Köbes&quot; immediately replaces an empty &quot;Stange&quot; with a full one, marking a tick on the coaster under the &quot;Stange&quot;. If the drinker does not want another refill, they place the coaster on top of the empty &quot;Stange&quot; and pay for the number of beers marked on the coaster.

==Outside the EU==
As noted above, is a product which has a protected geographical indication (PGI) in the EU. This protection is not recognized outside the jurisdiction of the EU, and many breweries outside the EU produce and market beer as &quot;kolsch&quot; or &quot;kölsch&quot; with varying degrees of authenticity.

<doc id="493621" wikidata="Q607913" url="?curid=493621" title="Dalmatic">
<text>The dalmatic is a long, wide-sleeved tunic, which serves as a liturgical vestment in the Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, United Methodist, and some other churches. When used, it is the proper vestment of a deacon at Mass, Holy Communion or other services such as baptism or marriage held in the context of a Eucharistic service. Although infrequent, it may also be worn by bishops above the alb and below the chasuble, and is then referred to as pontifical dalmatic.

Like the chasuble worn by priests and bishops, it is an outer vestment and is supposed to match the liturgical colour of the day. The dalmatic is often made of the same material and decoration as a chasuble, so as to form a matching pair. Traditional Solemn Mass vestment sets include matching chasuble, dalmatic, and tunicle.

== History ==
In the Roman Empire, the dalmatic was an amply sleeved tunic (from Dalmatia) with wide stripes &quot;(clavi)&quot; that were sometimes worked with elaborate designs. Dalmatics had become typical attire for upper-class women in the latter part of the 3rd century AD. They are pictured in a few funerary portraits on shrouds from Antinoopolis in Roman Egypt. Literary sources record dalmatics as imperial gifts to individuals.

It was a normal item of clothing at the time when ecclesiastical clothes began to develop separately around the fourth century, worn over a longer tunic by the upper classes, and as the longest part of the dress of men of lower rank.

The dalmatic was a garment of Byzantine dress, and was adopted by Emperor Paul I of the Russian Empire as a coronation and liturgical vestment. In Orthodox icons of Jesus Christ as King and Great he is shown in a dalmatic.

== Roman Church ==
The dalmatic is a robe with wide sleeves; it reaches to at least the knees or lower. In 18th-century vestment fashion, it is customary to slit the under side of the sleeves so that the dalmatic becomes a mantle like a scapular with an opening for the head and two square pieces of the material falling from the shoulder over the upper arm. Modern dalmatics tend to be longer and have closed sleeves, with the sides being open below the sleeve. The distinctive ornamentation of the vestment consists of two vertical stripes running from the shoulder to the hem; according to Roman usage these stripes are narrow and sometimes united at the bottom by two narrow cross-stripes. Outside of Rome the vertical stripes are quite broad and the cross-piece is on the upper part of the garment. At a Pontifical High Mass, a dalmatic (usually made of lighter material) is worn by the bishop under the chasuble. At solemn papal liturgical occasions the Pope is assisted by two cardinal-deacons each vested in a dalmatic and wearing a &quot;mitra simplex&quot; (simple white mitre).

In the Roman Catholic Church the subdeacons wore a vestment called the tunicle, which was originally distinct from a dalmatic, but by the 17th century the two had become identical, though a tunicle was often less ornamented than a dalmatic, the main difference often being only one horizontal stripe versus the two becoming a deacon&#x27;s vestment. Additionally, unlike deacons, subdeacons do not wear a stole under their tunicle. Today, the tunicle is rare in the Roman Catholic Church as only certain authorized clerical societies (such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter) have subdeacons.

Traditionally the dalmatic was not used in the Roman Rite by deacons during Lent. In its place, depending on the point in the liturgy, was worn either a folded chasuble or what was called a broad stole, which represented a rolled-up chasuble. This tradition went back to a time at which the dalmatic was still considered an essential secular garment and thus not appropriate to be worn during the penitential season of Lent.

== Eastern tradition ==

In the Byzantine Rite the &quot;sakkos&quot;, which is elaborately decorated and amply cut, usually worn by the bishops as an outer vestment in place of a presbyter&#x27;s &quot;phelonion&quot; and which, like the &quot;phelonion&quot;, corresponds to the western chasuble and cope, is derived from Byzantine imperial dress, and hence is identical in origin to the Western dalmatic.

In all Eastern rites the &quot;sticharion&quot; (which is analogous to the Western alb), of the ornate sort worn by deacons and lower clergy, is sometimes referred to as a dalmatic.

<doc id="493626" wikidata="Q4624" url="?curid=493626" title="Colognian dialect">
<text>Colognian or Kölsch (; natively ) is a small set of very closely related dialects, or variants, of the Ripuarian group of dialects of the Central German group. These dialects are spoken in the area covered by the Archdiocese and former Electorate of Cologne reaching from Neuss in the north to just south of Bonn, west to Düren and east to Olpe in northwest Germany.

==Name==
In the Ripuarian dialects, &quot;&quot; is an adjective meaning or , thus equivalent to &quot;Colognian&quot;. Its nominalized forms (, etc.) denote the inhabitants of Cologne. The word &quot;&quot;, without an article, refers to either the dialect or the local Kölsch beer. Hence the humorous Colognian saying: &quot;Ours is the only language you can drink!&quot;

==Speakers==
In Cologne, it is actively spoken by about 250,000 people, roughly one quarter of the population.
Almost all speakers are also fluent in standard or high German.
It is widely understood in a region inhabited by some 10 million people (a conservative estimate).

There is a community of people who speak a variety of Kölsch in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States.

==Area==
There are local (decreasingly divergent) variants of Kölsch in the Quarters, most notably those only recently incorporated into the city, and the Hinterland. Sometimes, also the far more than 100 clearly distinct Ripuarian languages of Belgium, the Netherlands, and German Rhineland are incorrectly referred to as Kölsch, as well as the &quot;Rhinelandic regiolect&quot;. In fact, the regiolect is very different from Kölsch, being the regional variety of Standard German influenced only to a certain degree by the dialect. As such, many native speakers of the regiolect are in fact unaware of the fact that a “regiolect” exists, believing they speak plain Standard German.

==History and classification==
In its modern form, it is of comparatively recent origin. It developed from Historic Colognian, but has been under the influence of New High German since the 17th century. It was also influenced by French during the occupation of the Left Bank of the Rhine under Napoleon Bonaparte from 1794 to 1815, and therefore contains some more words from and expressions pertaining to French than does Standard German. There are also phonological similarities with French, which however may be coincidental.

Kölsch is one of the variants of the Ripuarian dialects (not part of the 
Rhinelandic regiolect, &quot;rheinisch&quot;), which belong to West Middle German family. It is closely related to the lower Rhineland (&quot;niederrheinisch&quot;) and Moselle Franconian (&quot;moselfränkisch&quot;) dialects and combines some features of them, as well employing a variety of words hardly in use elsewhere. Common with the Limburgish language group and other Ripuarian languages, it has a phonemic pitch accent, referred to as the &#x27;singing&#x27; Rhinelandic tone.

==Features in comparison to Standard German==
This list shows only the most important differences. Most of these are not uniquely Kölsch, but true for all Ripuarian dialects.

* Kölsch uses , or even instead of standard , so when Colonians say &quot;ich&quot;, it sounds more like &quot;isch&quot;.
* The Standard German phoneme is pronounced in the beginning of a word, and , , or in other positions, depending on the syllable structure. This gives rise to the erroneous belief that &quot;im Kölschen jibbet kein Je&quot; (Rheinlander regiolect German: &quot;In Colognian there is no &quot;G&quot;); in fact Colognian does have the phoneme /g/, just not where Standard German speakers expect: &quot;rigge&quot; &quot;to ride&quot; (German: &quot;reiten&quot;)
* Kölsch has three diphthongs pronounced , and , which are equivalent to but less frequent than , and in the standard.
* Voiceless stops are not aspirated, in contrast to Standard German and most varieties of English (although there are some dialects in Scotland and Northern England where voiceless stops are not aspirated).
* The sound is &quot;darker&quot; than in Standard German, and is replaced by throughout (&quot;Kölsch&quot;: (Colognian) ; (Standard German) )
* Words with an initial vowel are not separated from the preceding word by a glottal stop.
* Kölsch has a larger vowel system than Standard German. In Standard German and are always short, , and always long. In Kölsch all of these occur long and short, and the difference is phonemic.
* Vowel quality often differs between standard words and Kölsch words. Sometimes the standard has the more original form, sometimes Kölsch does. Standard , , often correspond to Kölsch , , , and , , often correspond to , , . Standard , , often correspond to Kölsch , and , and , often correspond to and . All of these patterns (and others to be found), however, have many exceptions and cannot be used to build Kölsch words blindly.
* Kölsch is even more non-rhotic than the standard. It often vocalizes &quot;r&quot; completely so that any hint of it is lost, e.g. std. &quot;kurz&quot;, ksh. &quot;koot&quot;.
** When it does not vocalize an &quot;r&quot;, it will often be pronounced more strongly than in German: &quot;Sport&quot; [ɕpɔxt] (often humorously spelled &quot;Spocht&quot;). This carries over into the Cologne accent of German.
* Being a Central German dialect, Kölsch has undergone some stages of the High German sound shift, but not all. Where the standard has &quot;pf&quot;, Kölsch uses &quot;p&quot;, as do Lower German and English. Compare: Standard German: &quot;Apfel, Pfanne&quot;; Kölsch: &quot;Appel, Pann&quot;, English: &quot;apple, pan&quot;. Moreover, where the standard has &quot;t&quot;, Kölsch usually keeps the older &quot;d&quot;: Standard German: &quot;Tag, tun&quot;; Kölsch: &quot;Daach, donn&quot;; English: &quot;day, do&quot;.
* Kölsch has shifted stem-internal and to . Again, this sound change is shared by Lower German and English. Compare: Standard German: &quot;leben, Ofen&quot;; Kölsch: &quot;levve, Ovve&quot;; English: &quot;live, oven&quot; (note that this does not affect shifted from older , e.g. Kölsch &quot;schlofe&quot;, English &quot;to sleep&quot;).
* As a typically Ripuarian phenomenon, and have changed into and in some cases, e.g. std. &quot;schneiden, Wein&quot;, ksh. &quot;schnigge, Wing&quot;.
** Specifically, Middle High German &quot;ît, îd, în&quot; , &quot;ût, ûd, ûn&quot; , &quot;iut, iud, iun&quot; &gt; Colognian &quot;igg, ugg, ügg; ing, ung, üng&quot; . The similar change to was originally near-universal, but has been lost in several words, most likely due to Standard German influence. (Münch gives for examples &quot;fryŋ̄k&quot;, &quot;kiŋ̄k&quot; &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, where modern Kölsch has &quot;Fründ&quot;, &quot;Kind&quot;. (German: &quot;Freund&quot;, &quot;Kind&quot;)
** The word &quot;dütsch&quot; (German), compare German &quot;deutsch&quot;, has also been influenced by surrounding dialects and the standard, and the fully Kölsch form *&quot;düksch&quot; is unheard of.
* In Kölsch, the final &quot;t&quot; after is dropped at the end of words followed by another consonant (except &quot;l, m, n, ng&quot;). When a vowel is added, a lost &quot;t&quot; can reoccur.
* In Kölsch the word-final schwa is dropped and the standard ending &quot;-en&quot; is often shortened to schwa. Therefore, Kölsch plurals often resemble Standard German singulars, e.g., std. &quot;&quot;Gasse&quot; &gt; &quot;Gassen&quot;, ksh. &quot;Jass&quot; &gt; &quot;Jasse&quot;&quot; (alley, alleys).
* Kölsch has a reduced case system, where the genitive is lost. The accusative and nominative are merged (except with personal pronouns), in most cases taking the form of the nominative; Standard German Der Mann läuft die Straße entlang; ich sehe den Mann&quot;, Kölsch Der Mann läuf de Stroß elans, ich sinn der Mann.&quot;. In the case of adjectives, including possessive pronouns, determiners and indefinite articles, Kölsch takes the form of the accusative; compare Standard German: &quot;mein Mann, meine Frau&quot;; to Kölsch: &quot;minge Mann, ming Frau&quot;, originally *&quot;mingen Mann, minge Frau&quot;, cf. the German accusative &quot;meinen Mann, meine Frau&quot;; English: &quot;my husband, my wife&quot;.
* Many regular verbs of Standard German have an irregular present tense form conjugation in Kölsch, e.g. the verb &quot;stonn&quot; (= std. &quot;stehen&quot; and English &quot;to stand&quot;) is conjugated as follows: &quot;ich stonn, du steihs, hä steiht, mir stonn, ehr stoht, se stonn&quot;.

=== Phonology ===
==Use==

In comparison to most other German dialects, Kölsch is unusually well documented through the work of the Akademie för uns Kölsche Sproch and scholars such as , whose publications include a dictionary, a grammar and a variety of phrase books. While Kölsch is not commonly taught in schools (although there are often extracurricular offerings) and a lot of young people do not have a proper command of it, many theaters exist that perform exclusively in Kölsch, most notably the &quot;Volkstheater Millowitsch&quot;, named after the late Willy Millowitsch (1909–1999) and the famous puppet theater, &quot;Hänneschen-Theater&quot;. There has also recently been an increase in literature written in this dialect and both traditional music and rock in Kölsch are very popular in and beyond Cologne, especially around Carnival, including bands such as Brings, , Bläck Fööss, Höhner and others. The Kölsch rock group BAP is even among the most successful rock bands in Germany. Another noticeable phenomenon is the usage of either a watered-down Kölsch dialect or the Rhinelandic regiolect by German TV personalities, especially comedians such as and others.

==The Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Kölsch==
This is a relatively recent, and modern, version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Colognian, by Jean Jenniches (1894–1979).
 &quot;Nota bene&quot;: This is not a literal, but an artistic rendition of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.
&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;
&quot;English translation:&quot;
 &quot;Nota bene&quot;: This is not a literal, but an artistic rendition of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.
&lt;poem&gt;
Our Father

Dear Lord God, holy is Your Name.
From the heavens You rule all the universe
according to Your will.
Like a father you care for humanity,
which awaits Your Kingdom here on Earth.
There is much need in the world, and thus we pray:
Make it so that no person should have to
suffer hunger anymore.
Take from us our debts,
so that every one of us is merciful to
his own debtors.
Help us to withstand all temptation,
and keep everything that could harm our
eternal salvation.

Amen.

<text>The Volcán de Colima, , also known as Volcán de Fuego, is part of the Colima Volcanic Complex (CVC) consisting of Volcán de Colima, Nevado de Colima () and the eroded El Cántaro (listed as extinct). It is the youngest of the three and as of 2015 is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico and in North America. It has erupted more than 40 times since 1576. One of the largest eruptions was on January 20–24, 1913. Nevado de Colima, also known as Tzapotépetl, lies north of its more active neighbor and is the taller of the two at . It is the 26th-most prominent peak in North America.

Despite its name, only a fraction of the volcano&#x27;s surface area is in the state of Colima; the majority of its surface area lies over the border in the neighboring state of Jalisco, toward the western end of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. It is about west of Mexico City and south of Guadalajara, Jalisco.

Since 1869–1878, a parasitic set of domes, collectively known as &quot;El Volcancito&quot;, has formed on the northeast flank of the main cone of the volcano.

==Geological history==
In the late Pleistocene era, a huge landslide occurred at the mountain, with approximately of debris traveling some 120 km, reaching the Pacific Ocean. An area of some 2,200 km2 was covered in landslide deposits. The currently active cone is within a large caldera that was probably formed by a combination of landslides and large eruptions. The lava is andesite containing 56-61% SiO2. About 300,000 people live within of the volcano, which makes it the most dangerous volcano in Mexico. In light of its history of large eruptions and situation in a densely populated area, it was designated a Decade Volcano, singling it out for study.

==Current activity==
In recent years, there have been frequent temporary evacuations of nearby villagers due to threatening volcanic activity. Eruptions have occurred in 1991, 1998–1999 and from 2001 to the present day, with activity being characterized by extrusion of viscous lava forming a lava dome, and occasional larger explosions, forming pyroclastic flows and dusting the areas surrounding the volcano with ash and tephra.

The largest eruption for several years occurred on May 24, 2005. An ash cloud rose to more than 3 km over the volcano and satellite monitoring indicated that the cloud spread over an area extending west of the volcano in the hours after the eruption. Pyroclastic flows travelled 4–5 km from the vent, and lava bombs landed 3–4 km away. Authorities set up an exclusion zone within 6.5 km of the summit.

On November 21, 2014, the volcano erupted again. An ash column was sent 5 km into the air, covering towns as far as 25 km away in ash. No fatalities were reported, and no evacuations took place. There were eruptions on January 10, 21 and 25, with the ash from the January 21 eruption falling in towns more than away. 
On 10 July 2015, there was another eruption. Another eruption occurred on September 25, 2016, sending a plume of ash and smoke into the sky. During December 2016, ash plumes occurred once or twice a day. On December 18, 2016, there were three eruptions. The biggest columns of ash reached 2 kilometers in height.
Colima volcano experienced another strong explosion at 06:27 UTC (00:27 CST) on January 18, 2017. The eruption spewed volcanic ash up to 4 km (13,123 feet) above the crater.

== Volcanological center ==
The volcano is monitored by the Colima Volcano Observatory at the University of Colima, Mexico. A team analyzes, interprets and communicates every event that occurs at this volcano.

In 2018, a webcam was installed close to the volcano, and volcanic activity can be seen in real-time.

<doc id="493649" wikidata="Q57489" url="?curid=493649" title="Killing of Benno Ohnesorg">
<text>Benno Ohnesorg (; 15 October 1940 – 2 June 1967) was a West German university student killed by a policeman during a demonstration in West Berlin. His death spurred the growth of the left-wing German student movement.

== Incident ==
===Protest===

On 2 June 1967, Ohnesorg participated in a student protest held near the Deutsche Oper in opposition to the state visit of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was attending a performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at the Deutsche Oper that night. It was the first political demonstration in which Ohnesorg had ever taken part.

===Violence and shooting===
The protest turned violent after pro-Shah demonstrators, including agents of the Shah&#x27;s intelligence service, began battling with students and the police overreacted, employing brutal tactics in their attempts to control the crowd. In the ensuing tumult, demonstrators dispersed into the side streets. In the courtyard of Krumme Straße 66, Ohnesorg was then shot in the back of the head by police officer Karl-Heinz Kurras. Ohnesorg died before he could be treated at a hospital. Kurras stood trial the same year and was acquitted, on 27 November 1967. Ohnesorg was a student of Romance and German studies. He was married and his wife was pregnant with their first child.

A week after Ohnesorg&#x27;s death, a funeral caravan accompanied his coffin as it was transported from West Berlin through checkpoints in East Germany to his hometown of Hanover in West Germany, where he was buried.

==Re-investigation==
More than forty years later, in 2009, it was revealed that at the time of the events Kurras had been an informal collaborator of the East German secret police Stasi and a long-time member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the ruling East German Communist party; however, the motive behind Kurras&#x27; act remains unclear. The new information was based on documents discovered in the Stasi archives. Initial reports indicated that the archives contained no evidence that Kurras was acting under Stasi orders when he shot Ohnesorg.

On the basis of the 2009 revelations about Kurras, the German prosecutor&#x27;s office initiated a new investigation, in order to clarify definitively whether there was any evidence that the killing of Ohnesorg could have been ordered by authorities in East Berlin; in November 2011, that investigation was officially closed with the determination that there was not enough evidence to justify reopening the case. The prosecutor&#x27;s office noted that, due to the passage of time, many participants in the trial were either no longer alive or otherwise unable to provide reliable testimony, and that documents relevant to the case were evidently among those destroyed by the East German foreign intelligence service in the interval between the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German reunification in 1990.

Following up in January 2012, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine reported that research carried out by federal prosecutors, as well as by the magazine, found that the shooting was not in self-defense as always claimed by Kurras and that it was certainly premeditated. Newly examined film and photographic evidence also implicated fellow officers and superiors, demonstrating that the police covered up the truth in subsequent investigations and trials. Additionally, medical staff who carried out the autopsy on Ohnesorg were ordered to falsify their report. However, the &quot;Spiegel&quot; report indicated that the new information was still unlikely to be sufficient for the case to be reopened.

== Legacy ==

Ohnesorg&#x27;s death served as a rallying point for the left, and spurred the growth of the left-wing German student movement. The Movement 2 June group, founded around 1971, was named for the day of his death. 

Student activist Rudi Dutschke led student protest actions in the period following Ohnesorg&#x27;s death. Just after Ohnesorg&#x27;s burial in Hanover, Dutschke, speaking at &quot;The University and Democracy: Conditions and Organization of Resistance&quot; conference held at the university, clashed with philosophy professor Jürgen Habermas over the future of the movement: Dutschke advocated radical, possibly illegal and violent action, although his first proposal was a peaceful sit-down strike. The conflict prompted Habermas, who had urged a more moderate approach, famously to characterize Dutschke&#x27;s ideology as amounting to &quot;left fascism&quot;, a formulation that he later retracted.

The student movement that swelled and, in part, became radicalised in the late 1960s, after Ohnesorg&#x27;s death, influenced many future German politicians who were in their teens and twenties at the time.

A monument next to the Deutsche Oper Berlin, which was designed by Austrian sculptor Alfred Hrdlicka, serves as a memorial for the killing. In December 2008, municipal authorities inaugurated an official memorial panel on the sidewalk in front of the house where Ohnesorg was shot, and in Ohnesorg&#x27;s hometown of Hanover, a bridge over the Ihme river is named after him.

===In film===
The opening scene of the 2008 film &quot;Der Baader Meinhof Komplex&quot; shows Ohnesorg&#x27;s death, with the role of Ohnesorg played by Martin Glade.

<doc id="493653" wikidata="Q862272" url="?curid=493653" title="Bill Luther">
<text>William Paul Luther (born June 27, 1945) is an American politician and lawyer from Minnesota. Luther was a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) member of the United States House of Representatives representing Minnesota&#x27;s 6th congressional district from January 3, 1995, to January 3, 2003, serving four consecutive terms.

== Biography ==
Luther was born in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, and was educated at the University of Minnesota, receiving a Bachelor of Science in 1967 and a Juris Doctor from the Law School in 1970.

=== Political career ===
He served on the Minnesota Governor&#x27;s Council on Consumer Affairs from 1974 to 1975 and was later a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1975 to 1976 and the Minnesota Senate from 1977 to 1994. During his career as a state legislator and a congressman, Luther gained an image as a moderate Democrat.

==== Congress ====
After the 2000 census, Minnesota&#x27;s congressional map was radically altered, even though the state didn&#x27;t gain or lose any districts. Luther&#x27;s 6th District in the northern Twin Cities suburbs was pushed slightly north and made significantly more Republican. After some consideration, Luther opted to run in the newly created 2nd District in the southern suburbs, which contained about 39 percent of his former territory. He faced a rematch against Republican John Kline, his opponent in 1998 and 2000.

During the campaign, Luther came under fire when one of his supporters, Sam Garst, filed for the race under the banner of the &quot;No New Taxes Party.&quot; This was done in retaliation for an ad the National Republican Congressional Committee ran in support of Kline that accused Luther of being soft on crime. Luther subsequently admitted that his campaign knew about Garst&#x27;s false flag campaign. Luther never really recovered and was soundly defeated, taking 42 percent of the vote.

He served in the 104th, 105th, 106th, and 107th congresses.

In 2006, Luther entered the DFL Party primary for the office of Minnesota Attorney General after endorsed candidate Matt Entenza withdrew from the race. He lost the primary to Lori Swanson.

=== Ethics appointment ===
He is an appointed member of the Office of Congressional Ethics, a nonpartisan, independent committee charged with overseeing outside ethics complaints against members of Congress.

<doc id="493654" wikidata="Q1480193" url="?curid=493654" title="Maniple (vestment)">
<text>The maniple is a liturgical vestment used primarily within the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, and occasionally by some Anglo-Catholic and Lutheran clergy. It is an embroidered band of silk or like fabric that hangs from the left forearm, worn over the alb. It is used only during Mass, and it is always of the same liturgical colour as other Mass vestments.

The original purpose of the maniple is unclear, but it probably originated as a cloth that the priest could use to wipe his hands and face. The maniple corresponds to the &quot;epimanikia&quot;, cuffs worn on both wrists in the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches.

==Current use==
In its 1967 instruction, &quot;Tres abhinc annos&quot;, issued while the Tridentine Mass was still the only form of the Mass in the Roman Rite, the Sacred Congregation of Rites removed the obligation to use the maniple at Mass. Thereafter, the maniple generally fell out of use. It is still required to be worn by those who, as authorized by Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s 2007 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, use the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal.

As Mauro Gagliardi, a consultor to the office for the Pope&#x27;s liturgical ceremonies, wrote in an article on the priest&#x27;s vesting prayers in the Tridentine Mass:

Citing this remark, John Zuhlsdorf has argued that, since the 1967 document did not formally abolish the maniple but only said it was no longer required, the maniple may be used even in what has, since 1970, been the Ordinary Form of the Mass. Edward McNamara, Professor of Liturgy at Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum in Rome, has rejected that view:
In fact, since 1970, the Roman Missal&#x27;s list of vestments to be used at Mass does not mention the maniple, although it does note another vestment, the amice, which is not always obligatory.

When used, the maniple is worn by a priest only when wearing a chasuble for celebrating the Mass. A bishop celebrating a Tridentine Low Mass dons the maniple only after the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. The 1960 Code of Rubrics, incorporated into the 1962 Roman Missal, states that the maniple is never worn with the cope (as, for instance, in the Asperges rite or in giving Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament); and, if no cope is available, it allows the priest to give such blessings vested in an alb and wearing a stole, but without chasuble and maniple.

The maniple is also worn with the dalmatic or tunicle, by the deacon and the subdeacon in a Solemn Mass, but only during the Mass proper. The maniple is not worn at other liturgical functions (e.g., the Asperges, processions) for which the dalmatic or tunicle is worn.

The maniple is also a vestment used in most of the other Latin liturgical rites.

With regard to what is now the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite, as revised in 1969, the General Instruction of the Roman Missal states: &quot;The vestment proper to the priest celebrant at Mass and other sacred actions directly connected with Mass is, unless otherwise indicated, the chasuble, worn over the alb and stole.&quot; For the deacon it says: &quot;The vestment proper to the deacon is the dalmatic, worn over the alb and stole. The dalmatic may, however, be omitted out of necessity or on account of a lesser degree of solemnity.&quot; In neither case is there any mention of the maniple as a vestment in use.

==Historical origin==
The visionary Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich described the maniple as already used by Jews at the time of Jesus.

Originally, the maniple was likely a piece of linen which clerics used to wipe their faces and hands, and has been described by some modern commentators as being akin to a handkerchief. It appears to have been used in the Roman liturgy since at least the 6th century. A maniple can vary widely in size, shape, and degree of embroidery and ornamentation.

Common symbolic comments refer to the maniple&#x27;s likeness to the rope by which Christ was led, and the chains which bound his hands. It has also become known as symbolic of the tears of penance, the burden of sin, and the fatigue of the priestly office. This understanding is reflected in the vesting prayer said while putting on the maniple before the Mass. Anglican commentators have described the maniple as a symbol of being a servant to the servants of God.

Alphonsus Liguori claimed: &quot;It is well known that the maniple was introduced for the purpose of wiping away the tears of devotion that flowed from the eyes of the priest; for in former times priests wept continually during the celebration of Mass.&quot; This echoes the rhymed vesting prayer the priest says when putting on the maniple:
In the older forms of a Papal Mass, the Pope wore a special maniple intertwined with red and gold threads, symbolizing the unity of the Eastern and Western rites of the Catholic Church.

<doc id="493657" wikidata="Q521718" url="?curid=493657" title="Murphy Brown">
<text>Murphy Brown is an American television sitcom created by Diane English that premiered on November 14, 1988, on CBS. The series stars Candice Bergen as the eponymous Murphy Brown, a famous investigative journalist and news anchor for &quot;FYI&quot;, a fictional CBS television newsmagazine, and later for &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot;, a cable morning news show.

The series originally ran until May 18, 1998, after airing a total of 247 episodes over ten seasons. In January 2018, it was announced that CBS ordered a 13-episode revival of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, which premiered on September 27, 2018. CBS canceled the revival after one season on May 10, 2019.

==Plot==
===Original run===
Murphy Brown (Candice Bergen) is a recovering alcoholic who, in the show&#x27;s first episode, returns to the fictional newsmagazine &quot;FYI&quot; for the first time following a stay at the Betty Ford Clinic residential treatment center. Over 40 and single, she is sharp-tongued and hard as nails. In her profession, she is considered one of the boys, having shattered many glass ceilings encountered during her career. Dominating the &quot;FYI&quot; news magazine, she is portrayed as one of America&#x27;s hardest-hitting (though not the warmest or most sympathetic) media personalities.

Her colleagues at &quot;FYI&quot; include stuffy veteran anchor Jim Dial (Charles Kimbrough), who affectionately addresses Murphy as &quot;Slugger&quot; and reminisces about the glory days of Murrow and Cronkite. Murphy&#x27;s best friend and sometime competitor is investigative reporter Frank Fontana (Joe Regalbuto), the only person who addresses her as &quot;Murph&quot;. Though a daredevil reporter, insecurities regarding fame and (especially) his personal relationships have him in psychotherapy for the majority of the series. In early seasons, there was a running gag about Frank&#x27;s toupée, which he hated, but which producers insisted he wear on the show.

Also present are the two newest members of the &quot;FYI&quot; team. Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud), a 25-year-old yuppie Harvard graduate and overachiever fresh from public television, is appointed the new executive producer of &quot;FYI&quot; during Murphy&#x27;s stay at Betty Ford. Naive and neurotic despite his lightning intellect, Miles is the perfect foil for Murphy&#x27;s wit. Shaud left at the end of the eighth season, and his character was replaced during Season 9 by veteran TV producer Kay Carter-Shepley (Lily Tomlin). Kay did not have a background in journalism but instead had made a career as a producer of game shows.

The other new-kid-on-the-block is Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford), who replaced Murphy during her stint in rehab. A former Miss America from the (fictional) town of Neebo, Louisiana, Corky is the bane of the other journalists with her perky, relentlessly sunny personality—and dumbfounding lack of sophistication. Due to overwhelming audience reaction, management decides to retain Corky&#x27;s services after Murphy&#x27;s return, usually assigning her to lifestyle pieces or lightweight celebrity profiles. Despite her omnipresent perkiness, Corky does mature and acquires a fair amount of worldliness over the years, not the least of which comes courtesy of her marriage to high school classmate and writer Will Forest (during which she humorously and cluelessly amends her on-air surname to &quot;Corky Sherwood-Forest&quot;), subsequent divorce, and later elopement with Miles, immediately after which the couple has second thoughts — even before consummating the relationship — and decides they should &quot;first&quot; date (despite already being married to one another), eventually separating on good terms.

The &quot;FYI&quot; team also frequently socializes at Phil&#x27;s, a bar-and-grill across the street from their office/studio in Washington, D.C. Phil, the bar owner, was played by Pat Corley. Phil&#x27;s was portrayed as a Washington institution, whose owner knew everything about everybody who had ever been anybody in the capital—ranging from what brand of lingerie J. Edgar Hoover preferred to the identity of Deep Throat (unknown to the public at the time of the series&#x27; production). In a running gag during early seasons, whenever someone entered Phil&#x27;s (casting bright sunlight from the open door into the dark, murky bar), the patrons shouted in unison, &quot;Close the door!&quot;

Brown was unmarried, but had a home life as well: she hired a laid-back, New Age philosophy-dispensing house painter named Eldin Bernecky (Robert Pastorelli) to repaint her house. He had so many grand ideas that he was in her employ for six seasons. Because he was a highly talented artist, his renovations were often delayed when he was struck by the urge to paint socially relevant murals throughout the house.

===Revival===
Some twenty years later, Murphy has been retired from broadcast journalism for a few years but constantly receives offers to return to the air. Following Donald Trump&#x27;s election as president of the United States, Brown decides to accept an offer from fictional cable news network CNC to host a new morning news show titled &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot;. She brings along her former &quot;FYI&quot; colleagues including Frank and Corky to co-host the program and Miles to produce it. The crew is joined by newcomer Pat Patel (Nik Dodani), who serves as the show&#x27;s social media manager. As the program gets closer to air, Brown is startled to learn that her son Avery (Jake McDorman) has been given his own morning news program on Murphy&#x27;s competitor, conservative cable news network Wolf News, with both of their shows scheduled to air against one another. Meanwhile, Murphy and the gang continue to spend their off-time at the bar and grill &quot;Phil&#x27;s Bar&quot;, now run by Phil&#x27;s sister Phyllis (Tyne Daly) following Phil&#x27;s death. Jim Dial, now in his 80s, widowed and retired, comes back on an occasional basis to act as an informal mentor to the &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot; gang.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===

* Candice Bergen as Murphy Brown, a famous investigative journalist and news anchor for &quot;FYI&quot;. In seasons 8 and 9, she also co-hosts a second show called &quot;Front and Center&quot;. Following a brief retirement, in 2018 Brown returns to television in her own morning news show &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot;. 
* Faith Ford as Corky Sherwood, a perky reporter (and former Miss America) hired to replace Murphy during her stay at the Betty Ford Clinic. Years later, she joins &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot; as a co-host after getting fired from her job on another morning talk show.
* Pat Corley as Phil (seasons 1–8; guest season 10), the extremely well-connected owner of Phil&#x27;s Bar where the staff of &quot;FYI&quot; are regulars.
* Charles Kimbrough as Jim Dial (seasons 1–10; recurring season 11), the trustworthy veteran news anchor for &quot;FYI&quot;. 
* Robert Pastorelli as Eldin Bernecky (seasons 1–7; guest season 10), an eccentric house painter that Murphy hires to renovate her house (and later employs as a live-in nanny). 
* Joe Regalbuto as Frank Fontana, an investigative reporter on &quot;FYI&quot; and later &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot;, and Murphy&#x27;s best friend.
* Grant Shaud as Miles Silverberg (seasons 1–8, 11), the very young and nervous, but also bright and competent, executive producer at &quot;FYI&quot; and later &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot;.
* Lily Tomlin as Kay Carter-Shepley (seasons 9–10), a crafty veteran television producer who has absolutely no news experience, and who replaces Miles at &quot;FYI&quot;.
* Dyllan Christopher (recurring seasons 7–8), Jackson Buckley (guest season 9), Haley Joel Osment (recurring season 10), and Jake McDorman (season 11) as Avery Brown, Murphy&#x27;s son and a journalist and a liberal commentator on the conservative-leaning Wolf Network. In the original run of the series, he appears as a young child while in the revival he is some twenty years older.
* Nik Dodani as Pat Patel (season 11), the director of social media for &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot;.
* Adan Rocha as Miguel Gonzales (season 11), a college student working at Phil&#x27;s Bar in order to make extra money for his tuition.
* Tyne Daly as Phyllis (Season 11), the sister of Phil and the current owner of Phil&#x27;s Bar.

===Recurring===
====Behind the scenes at FYI====
* John Hostetter as John, the stage manager at &quot;FYI&quot;.
* Ritch Brinkley as Carl Wishnitski, a cameraman at &quot;FYI&quot; who has an ongoing attraction to Murphy.
* Alan Oppenheimer as Gene Kinsella, a news-division executive. Seen as a recurring character in seasons 1–5, Kinsella is generally supportive of and liked by his FYI staff. In-show, the character is let go from his position and replaced with...
* Julius Carry as Mitchell Baldwin, the Machiavellian new boss who replaces Gene Kinsella. Baldwin, a Black man used the team&#x27;s liberal-Caucasian guilt to railroad through changes in &quot;FYI&quot;s format and content. Appears in seasons 5 and 6, and in a dream sequence in season 8. Essentially superseded as the network thorn in &quot;FYI&quot;s side by... 
* Garry Marshall as Stan Lansing, the very excitable, aggressive, and micro-managing network president. His frequent and impromptu whims are the bane of the &quot;FYI&quot; staff. Seen fairly regularly in seasons 6–9, and one final time in season 10.
* Paul Reubens as Andrew J. Lansing III, Stan Lansing&#x27;s sociopathic nephew. He is introduced as one of Murphy&#x27;s 93 secretaries &quot;du jour&quot; and was one of only three who measure up to Murphy&#x27;s standards. Like the few other secretaries who were actually competent, Andrew is lured away from Murphy by another job by the end of the episode; in his case, he is promoted to a network executive position through nepotism. He periodically appears in later episodes, although his network career is wildly unpredictable, largely due to the mercurial nature of his uncle and mentor—at various times, Andrew is a network VP, an executive producer, and a mailboy. Seen as an occasional character in seasons 7–9.
====On camera at FYI====
* Christopher Rich as Miller Redfield, an empty-headed, pretty-boy reporter with a local affiliate who had semi-regular appearances on the show. At first, he was a recurring substitute anchor, but after a gap of a few years, he became a regular member of the &quot;FYI&quot; team —- although the rest of the team frequently (usually unsuccessfully) conspired to get rid of him. Later co-hosted a separate news show with Murphy called &quot;Front and Center&quot;, produced out of the same office. Seen once per season in seasons 2–4, he was then seen very frequently in seasons 7–9.
* Wallace Shawn as Stuart Best, a buffoonish former &quot;FYI&quot; reporter who annoyed Murphy, Jim, and Frank to the point that the three colluded to have him fired —- twice. After the second firing, Stuart returned as a hopelessly inept party-line politician who invariably broke down under even the most sympathetic questions by Murphy while on-air. Appeared once a season in seasons 6–9.
* Scott Bakula as Peter Hunt, a reporter and occasional love interest of Murphy&#x27;s. Seen in seasons 6 through 8.
* Paula Cale as McGovern, a conservative young reporter based on MTV&#x27;s Kennedy. She was added to the program when management tried to appeal to a younger demographic. Seen for a run of episodes as a regular towards the end of season 7, the character was then quietly dropped without explanation and never mentioned again.
====Family and love interests====
* Colleen Dewhurst as Avery Brown, a museum curator and Murphy&#x27;s opinionated mother. Dewhurst won two Emmy Awards for her appearances, appearing in a total of four episodes in seasons 1–3. When Dewhurst died in 1991, the writers chose to have her character die as well, and dedicated the episode to the memory of Dewhurst. Murphy, who was pregnant at the time of her mother&#x27;s death, named her son Avery in her mother&#x27;s memory the following season.
* Darren McGavin as Bill Brown, a newspaper publisher and Murphy&#x27;s father. Bill shared an adversarial relationship with his ex-wife Avery—especially after marrying Karen, a fresh-faced twenty-something who taught yoga. McGavin appeared in four episodes as Bill Brown (in seasons 2, 4 and 5) and earned an Emmy nomination in 1990 for his performance.
* Jay Thomas as Jerry Gold, an abrasive tabloid talk show host who became a friend of Murphy&#x27;s and an occasional love interest, despite their significantly different journalistic values. Seen in seasons 2–4; returns in a dream sequence in 8, and in one episode (now about to get married) during season 10.
* Robin Thomas as Jake Lowenstein, an underground leftist radical and Murphy&#x27;s ex-husband from long before her FYI days. Seen very infrequently, for a total of five episodes in seasons 1, 3, 4 and 8. Murphy and Jake had a brief relationship during season three, which resulted in Murphy&#x27;s pregnancy.
* Jane Leeves as Audrey Cohen, Miles&#x27; girlfriend, seen occasionally in seasons 2–5.

==Episodes==

==Production==
===Early seasons===

The first season saw Murphy relearning her job without the use of two crutches—alcohol and cigarettes. In the pilot episode, she complained the only vice she had left herself was chewing yellow number-two pencils. It also set up the series-long running gag of Murphy&#x27;s battles with the off-beat and sometimes downright bizarre characters who were sent by Personnel to act as her secretary, none of whom ever last for more than an episode, save two; one played by Paul Reubens.

Action was divided between the &quot;FYI&quot; suite of offices and Murphy&#x27;s Georgetown townhouse. Reality often blended with fiction with the many cameos of then-current media and political personalities. The most prominent was when Murphy Brown was asked to guest star as herself in the pilot of a sitcom entitled &quot;Kelly Green&quot;, about a female investigative journalist. Life imitated art when, after a less-than stellar performance, Murphy was berated by television journalist Connie Chung (herself in a &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; cameo appearance) for crossing the line and compromising her credibility.

Subsequent seasons saw the emergence of story arcs involving network politics with Gene Kinsella, Frank and Murphy&#x27;s rivalry and Eldin&#x27;s ongoing infatuation with Corky. A standout event was Miss Sherwood&#x27;s marriage to Louisiana lawyer Will Forrest. During the brief engagement, a horrified Corky comes to the realization that she will now be &quot;Corky Sherwood-Forrest&quot;. In the wedding episode, maid-of-honor Murphy, dressed as an antebellum belle in a hoop-skirted nightmare of a bridemaid&#x27;s dress, rages her way through the entire affair while thwarting the press&#x27;s attempts to photograph the nuptials (mirroring the Sean Penn/Madonna wedding a few years earlier).

===Later seasons===
The fifth season continued after the departure of series creator and showrunner Diane English. Murphy&#x27;s struggles with parenthood were highlighted, as were the revolving-door of nanny characters mirroring her office tribulations. Corky&#x27;s marriage unraveled and ended in divorce as she and Will grew apart. (Right before the wedding, Forrest had decided to abandon the practice of law and follow his true calling—creative writing.) This tragedy saw Corky become less the Pollyanna as she began to model herself after role-model Murphy.

The show went on, and &quot;FYI&quot; featured several changes in on- and off-camera staff: Peter Hunt, McGovern and Miller Redfield temporarily joined the regulars at the anchor desk. The network moved &quot;FYI&quot; to a new studio with a trendy exterior &quot;Window on America&quot;. A significant story arc saw the network squelch an &quot;FYI&quot; exposé on the tobacco industry, leading to the resignation of first Dial, then the remainder of the cast. They all went to work reorganizing the poorly-performing news division of a fledgling network. In the end, Miles faced down the network; the &quot;suits&quot; relented, the staffers returned and the story aired. For his courage in standing up to the network brass, Miles was promoted to the news division&#x27;s headquarters in New York—to the detriment of his new marriage to Corky.

As well, after years of working as her housepainter, and later nanny, Eldin (who was seen increasingly infrequently after season 5) left Murphy&#x27;s employ during season 7 to study painting in Spain. (Actor Robert Pastorelli left &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; for his own starring vehicle, the sitcom &quot;Double Rush&quot;, which lasted one season in 1995.)
By the start of the 1996–97 season, viewership was beginning to decline. Shaud left the series and comedian Lily Tomlin was brought in to replace him in the role of executive producer Kay Carter-Shepley to help bolster the sitcom&#x27;s ratings. Kay proved that she had just as little journalistic experience as Miles Silverberg when he started with the show; the only experience Kay had in television—in spite of her venerable connections—was producing daytime game shows. Where Murphy had terrorized the younger Miles, the Machiavellian Kay often emerged victorious in her dealings with Murphy. Tomlin remained with the series for its last two years but ratings continued to drop, especially after a move off of Monday nights in favor of a slot on Wednesday nights. CBS did renew &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; for a tenth season, which was to be its last.

In the fall of 1997, the final season premiered and the entire season served as a story arc in which Murphy battled breast cancer. The storyline was not without controversy; an episode in which she used medical marijuana to relieve side effects of chemotherapy was attacked by conservative groups, and a women&#x27;s health group protested an episode in which Murphy, while shopping for prosthetic breasts, uttered the line &quot;Should I go with Demi Moore or Elsie the Cow?&quot;

However, the show&#x27;s handling of the subject was credited with a 30 percent increase in the number of women getting mammograms that year, and Bergen was presented an award from the American Cancer Society in honor of her role in educating women on the importance of breast cancer prevention and screening.

In the original run&#x27;s final episode, Murphy met and interviewed God (played by Alan King) and Edward R. Murrow in a dream while undergoing surgery. Computer editing was used to insert footage of the real Murrow, who died in 1965, into the show. Diane English, who created the show, made a cameo appearance as a nurse who delivered the results to Murphy after her surgery. At the end of the episode, Murphy walks through her house seemingly alone, only to have Eldin appear at the end, offering to &quot;touch up&quot; her house.

==Continuation==
===Development===
Following the end of the show&#x27;s original run, series creator Diane English had been approached multiple times about potentially reviving the series. Around 2008, the show came the closest to being brought back to the air following Sarah Palin&#x27;s nomination as the Republican vice-presidential nominee with comparisons being drawn between her and former &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; critic Dan Quayle. In 2017, Warner Bros. Television again approached English about reviving the series following the election of Donald Trump as president. English spent nine months developing an idea for a new iteration of the series before finally composing a script. Candice Bergen was then approached about signing on to the project and she agreed on the condition that Faith Ford, Joe Regalbuto, and Grant Shaud join as well.

On January 24, 2018, it was announced that CBS had given the production a series order for one season consisting of thirteen episodes set to air during the 2018–2019 season. English and Bergen were set to serve as executive producers of the revival which would, according to CBS, be set in &quot;a world of cable news, social media, fake news and a very different political and cultural climate.&quot; Production companies involved with the series were slated to consist of Bend in the Road Productions and Warner Bros. Television. On February 27, 2018, it was announced that Pam Fryman would direct the revival&#x27;s pilot episode.

On May 16, 2018, it was announced during the CBS upfronts presentation that the revival would now have Murphy anchoring a cable morning show, &quot;Murphy In the Morning&quot;, with her old team, lifestyle reporter Corky Sherwood, investigative journalist Frank Fontana, and producer Miles Silverberg, while Murphy&#x27;s son Avery would host a rival, cable morning show that airs opposite his mother&#x27;s program. On July 9, 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere on September 27, 2018. On September 21, 2018, it was reported that CBS had extended the running time of the premiere episode of the revival by five minutes.

On November 28, 2018, it was reported that the season would end after the thirteen episodes ordered by CBS had aired. However, it was further reported that the series was still under consideration by CBS to be renewed for another season. On May 10, 2019, CBS canceled the revival series after a single season.

===Casting===
Alongside the initial announcement of the revival, it was confirmed that Candice Bergen would reprise her role as Murphy Brown. On February 26, 2018, it was announced that Faith Ford, Joe Regalbuto, and Grant Shaud were joining the main cast and reprising their roles from the series&#x27; original run. It was also reported Charles Kimbrough would not be returning to the series full-time, but might make a guest appearance in the revival. On March 16, 2018, it was announced that Jake McDorman and Nik Dodani had also joined the main cast. McDorman was set to assume the role of Murphy Brown&#x27;s now adult son Avery. On April 19, 2018, it was announced that Tyne Daly had joined the main cast in the role of Phyllis, the sister of the deceased bar owner Phil from the series&#x27; original run. On August 5, 2018, it was confirmed during the Television Critics Association&#x27;s annual summer press tour that Kimbrough would reprise his role from the series&#x27; original run in a three-episode story arc. On September 13, 2018, it was reported that Adan Rocha had been cast in a series regular role. In October 2018, it was announced that Merle Dandridge had joined the cast in a recurring capacity and that Bette Midler, Brooke Shields, John Larroquette, Katie Couric, and Peter Gallagher would appear in guest-starring roles.

Before the premiere of the season, it was reported that the first episode would feature a guest appearance from a prominent individual. The identity of the guest was kept secret until the episode aired with the network going so far as to not include the scene in which they appeared in screeners for the press. Upon the episode&#x27;s release, it was revealed that the guest star was in fact former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an approval rating of 45% with an average rating of 6.00 out of 10, based on 47 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;This just in: while the nostalgia and wit are welcome, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;″s dated messaging tactics feel heavy-handed and smug, leaving this formerly formidably timely series feeling like a reboot reaching for the headlines.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 53 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
===Murphy as a single mother===
In the show&#x27;s 1991–92 season, Murphy became pregnant. When her baby&#x27;s father (ex-husband and current underground radical Jake Lowenstein) expressed his unwillingness to give up his own lifestyle to be a parent, Murphy chose to have the child and raise it alone. Another major fiction-reality blending came at Murphy&#x27;s baby shower: the invited guests were journalists Katie Couric, Joan Lunden, Paula Zahn, Mary Alice Williams and Faith Daniels, who treated the fictional Murphy and Corky as friends and peers.
At the point where she was about to give birth, she had stated that &quot;several people do not want me to have the baby. Pat Robertson; Phyllis Schlafly; half of Utah!&quot; Right after giving birth to her son Avery, Murphy sang the song &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot;. This storyline made the show a subject of political controversy during the 1992 American presidential campaign. On May 19, 1992, Vice President Dan Quayle spoke at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. During his speech, he criticized the Murphy Brown character for &quot;mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone&quot;.

Quayle&#x27;s remarks caused a public discussion on family values, culminating in the 1992–93 season premiere, &quot;You Say Potatoe, I Say Potato&quot;, where the television characters reacted to Quayle&#x27;s comments and produced a special episode of &quot;FYI&quot; showcasing and celebrating the diversity of the modern American family. Because Quayle&#x27;s actual speech made little reference to Murphy Brown&#x27;s fictional nature (other than the use of the word &quot;character&quot;), the show was able to use actual footage from his speech to make it appear that, within the fictional world of the show, Quayle was referring to Murphy Brown personally, rather than to the fictional character. At the end, Brown helps organize a special edition of &quot;FYI&quot; focusing on different kinds of families, then arranges a retaliatory prank in which a truckload of potatoes is dumped in front of Quayle&#x27;s residence while a disc jockey playfully commenting on the incident notes the Vice President should be glad people were not making fun of him for misspelling &quot;fertilizer&quot;. This referenced how, on June 15, 1992, at a spelling bee in Trenton, New Jersey, Quayle had erroneously corrected an elementary-school student&#x27;s spelling of &quot;potato&quot; to &quot;potatoe&quot;. The cue card used by the teacher read &quot;potatoe&quot;. When Candice Bergen won another Emmy that year, she thanked Dan Quayle. The feud was cited by E! as #81 on its list of &quot;101 Reasons the &#x27;90s Ruled&quot;.

In 2002, Bergen said in an interview that she personally agreed with much of Quayle&#x27;s speech, calling it &quot;a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable&quot; and adding that &quot;nobody agreed with that more than I did.&quot;

Quayle eventually displayed a sense of humor about the incident—after the controversy died down, he appeared for an interview on an independent Los Angeles TV station and for his final question was asked what his favorite TV show was. He responded with &quot;&quot;Murphy Brown&quot;—Not!&quot; The station later used the clip of Quayle&#x27;s response to promote its showing of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; re-runs in syndication.

Quayle&#x27;s complaint notwithstanding, prime-time TV in 1992 was &quot;boosting family values more aggressively than it has in decades&quot;, wrote &quot;Time&quot; magazine critic Richard Zoglin, citing everything from &quot;Home Improvement&quot; to &quot;Roseanne&quot;. &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; was worth highlighting in a vice-presidential speech &quot;not because it represented the state of television and the culture in general&quot; but because Murphy&#x27;s choice of single motherhood departed from it. The show has been seen as blazing a trail for single-mother characters in &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, and &quot;The Good Wife&quot;—and &quot;benefited from Bergen&#x27;s character going through a political maelstrom so none of them had to.&quot;

In 2010, Murphy was ranked #25 on the TV Guide Network special, &quot;25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time&quot;.

==Syndication==
&quot;Murphy Brown&quot; was unsuccessful when it was introduced in off-network syndication in the 1990s, in part because of costly music rights fees. Also, some topical news and cultural references featured in episodes of the show had quickly become dated. It was reintroduced to cable and digital multicast networks in the 2010s, beginning with a run on Encore Classic in 2013, with the series airing on Antenna TV as of 2018.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video released the first season of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on February 8, 2005. Due to low sales and high music licensing costs, no future releases are planned.

<text>Charles Philip Bednarik (May 1, 1925 – March 21, 2015), nicknamed &quot;Concrete Charlie&quot;, was an American professional football linebacker and center who played in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Penn Quakers, and was selected with the first overall pick of the 1949 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, where he played his entire 14-year NFL career from 1949 through 1962. Bednarik is ranked one of the hardest hitting tacklers in NFL history, and was one of the league&#x27;s last two-way players.

On November 20, 1960, Bednarik knocked New York Giants star halfback Frank Gifford unconscious with a tackle that was called &quot;professional football&#x27;s most notorious concussion&quot;. Bednarik&#x27;s career-altering tackle of the Giants&#x27; star is remembered in football lore as &quot;The Hit&quot;.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967, his first year of eligibility, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1969. He was named to the NFL 50th Anniversary All Time Team, the NFL 75th Anniversary All Time Two Way Team, and the NFL 100th Anniversary All Time Team.

==Early life and education==
Bednarik was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on May 1, 1925, to Charles Albert Bednarik and Mary A. (Pivovarnicek) Bednarik. Five years earlier, his parents had emigrated from Široké, a village in eastern Slovakia near Prešov, and settled in Bethlehem, where his father worked for Bethlehem Steel. His father never learned to read or write English and so could not advance to foreman. He first attended school at SS. Cyril &amp; Methodius, a Slovak parochial school in Bethlehem taught in Slovak. He then attended Bethlehem Catholic and later Liberty High School in Bethlehem, where he played football. In later life, Bednarik visited Slovakia three or four times. He went off to war before finishing high school, but was awarded a diploma and graduated in exchange for his service, an experience shared by football great Gino Marchetti.

===Military service===
Bednarik entered the U.S. Air Force, where he served as a B-24 waist gunner with the Eighth Air Force. During World War II, Bednarik flew on 30 combat missions over Nazi Germany. He was awarded the Air Medal, four Oak Leaf Clusters, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and four Battle Stars for his military service. His first mission was over Berlin on August 27, 1944, and last was over Zwiesel on April 20, 1945. After one mission, his flak-riddled plane crashed during a landing, and after skidding off the runway he had to kick out a window and jump 20 feet to the ground. He had the word MOTHER coming out of a blossoming flower tattooed on his forearm, so he could be identified if his plane was shot down.

===College===
Following World War II, in 1945, Bednarik entered the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia at 20 years old, where he was a 60-minute man, excelling as both center and linebacker, and sometimes as a punter for the Penn Quakers Football team . He married Emma Margetich in 1948. They first met at the Croatian Hall in Bethlehem.

At Penn, Bednarik was a two-time Consensus All-American in 1947 and 1948. Along with two of his teammates on the 1947 Penn team, George Savitsky (1991) and tailback Tony &quot;Skip&quot; Minisi (1985), and his coach, George Munger (1976), Bednarik was voted entry into the College Football Hall of Fame (1969). In 1948, Bednarik placed third in Heisman Trophy voting and won the Maxwell Award for outstanding college player that year. He was seventh place for the Heisman in 1947 and second team All-America in 1946. In 1969, he also was voted by a panel of sportswriters, coaches, and College Football Hall of Fame players as &quot;the greatest center of all-time.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; included him on its All-Century Team for college football.

The Chuck Bednarik Award is awarded annually by the Maxwell Football Club to the best defensive player in college football.

==Professional career==
Bednarik was the first player selected overall in the 1949 NFL draft, by the Philadelphia Eagles, where he went on to start on both offense as a center and on defense as a linebacker for the Eagles. He played 14 years for the Eagles (1949-1962). As a center, he proved to be a strong blocker and quick off the ball; and as a linebacker he was instinctive and could think like a coach.

Bednarik was a member of two Eagles&#x27; NFL Championship teams, in 1949 (a 14-0 win over the Los Angeles Rams) and again in 1960 (a 17-13 win over the Green Bay Packers). At 35 years old, in his twelfth season, he had been playing center, and had not been at middle linebacker for two years During the Eagles fifth game, left linebacker Bob Pellegrini suffered a broken leg and coach Buck Shaw asked Bednarik if he would step in at linebacker too, and Bednarik enthusiastically agreed; becoming a two-way player again.

Bednarik played 58 minutes in the 1960 NFL Championship Game. In the final play of that game, Bednarik was the last Eagles defensive player between the Green Bay Packers&#x27; Jim Taylor and the end zone. Bednarik tackled Taylor at the Eagles&#x27; eight-yard line, and remained atop Taylor as the final seconds ticked off the clock, ensuring the Packers could not run another play and preserving a 17–13 Eagles victory and the 1960 NFL championship. Once the clock ran out, Bednarik said, &quot;&#x27;You can get up now, Jim, this game is over...&#x27;&quot; The controversy surrounding this play led to the NFL putting in a rule penalizing defensive players for not allowing an offensive player to get up off the field.

Eagle quarterback Norm Van Brocklin was named the game&#x27;s MVP. After the game, Bednarik told Eagles receiver Pete Retzlaff that he felt like Paul Revere&#x27;s horse, &quot;&#x27;The horse did all the work ... but Paul Revere got all the credit.&#x27;&quot;

=== Gifford hit ===

On November 20, 1960, in a game between the Eagles and New York Giants at the original Yankee Stadium, Bednarik knocked Giants running back Frank Gifford out of football for over 18 months in one of the most famed tackles in NFL history, often referred to simply as The Hit. Bednarik&#x27;s clothesline tackle of Gifford dropped Gifford immediately to the ground, and Gifford immediately went unconscious. Gifford was transported from the field on a stretcher and then to a local hospital, where he was diagnosed with a deep concussion.

Bednarik was criticized after the game by Giants players and fans for apparently celebrating Gifford&#x27;s injury. A &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; photo of Bednarik standing over an unconscious Gifford became iconic, showing Bednarik in mid-celebration, right above Gifford as he lay unconscious on the field. Bednarik defended himself by saying that he was celebrating the fumble caused by the hit, which the Eagles recovered and clinched the victory for the Eagles, sending the team to 1960 NFL Championship Game. Years later, Gifford called the hit &quot;a clean shot&quot;, and said, &quot;Chuck hit me exactly the way I would have hit him.&quot; Gifford said, &quot;&#x27;I didn&#x27;t bear him any resentment and never have...&#x27;&quot; The play has been called &quot;one of the most iconic plays in NFL history.&quot;

===Quarrel with Noll===
Bednarik had a famous quarrel with future hall of fame coach Chuck Noll, who as a Cleveland Browns player, had smashed him in the face during a fourth-down punting play. A few years later, Bednarik punched Noll in an on-field confrontation after a game, which was being televised. NFL commissioner Bert Bell was upset about hurting the family-friendly image he wanted for the league, and subsequently fined Bednarik $500 and ordered him to apologize to Noll for the punch. According to Bednarik, when he gave the apology, Noll simply responded, &quot;Bullshit.&quot;

===Accomplishments and legacy===
Bednarik was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967, and was named to the NFL 50th Anniversary All Time Team as the center, the NFL 75th Anniversary All Time Two Way Team (center and linebacker), and the NFL 100th Anniversary All Time Team as a linebacker. He was named to the NFL All Decade Team for the 1950s as a center. He was selected All NFL nine times (as a center in 1950, and linebacker 1951-1957, 1960), and played in eight Pro Bowls. The Eagles retired his number 60 in 1987. They named him to their 75th Anniversary Team in 2007, where they honored Bednarik as the best center and middle linebacker in team history, Bednarik later saying, &quot;&#x27;On that day ... I felt like Benjamin Franklin.&#x27;&quot; In 2021, &quot;The Athletic&quot; named him the 54th greatest player ever.

He was MVP of the 1954 Pro Bowl, taking back an interception for a touchdown, recovering three fumbles, and even punting when the punter got injured.

He proved extremely durable, playing in 169 of 172 games in his 14 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, and two of his only three games missed were at the beginning of his rookie year. He spoke with coach Earle &quot;Greasy&quot; Neale after those games and asked to be traded if we was not going to play. He became a starter, playing linebacker and center, after that. He was the last of the NFL&#x27;s &quot;Sixty-Minute Men&quot;, players who played both offense and defense on a regular basis. Neale would give the induction speech for Bednarik when he joined the hall of fame.

Bednarik&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Concrete Charlie,&quot; originated from his off-season career as a concrete salesman for the Warner Company, not from his reputation as a ferocious tackler. Sportswriter Hugh Brown of &quot;The Evening Bulletin&quot; in Philadelphia, credited with bestowing Bednarik with the nickname, remarked that Bednarik &quot;is as hard as the concrete he sells.&quot;

Bednarik served as an analyst on the HBO program &quot;Inside The NFL&quot; for its inaugural season in 1977–78. The show was based in Philadelphia at its debut, with Bednarik and &quot;Big&quot; Al Meltzer as the hosts.

In 2021, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked the top 100 NFL players of all time, with Bednarik at 54. In 1999, he also was ranked number 54 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, making him the highest-ranking player to have spent his entire career with the Eagles, the highest-ranking offensive center, and the eighth-ranked linebacker in all of professional football.
In 2010, Bednarik was ranked 35th on the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot;. Ranked one spot ahead of Bednarik at #34 was Deion Sanders, a player for whom Bednarik had held open contempt in regards to being a two-way player.

General manager Ernie Accorsi called Bednarik &quot;&#x27;the John Wayne of football.&#x27;&quot;

==NFL career statistics==

==Opinions on current NFL players==
Bednarik was an outspoken, even bitter critic of modern NFL players for playing on only one side of the ball, calling them &quot;pussyfoots&quot;, noting that they &quot;suck air after five plays&quot; and that they &quot;couldn&#x27;t tackle my wife Emma&quot;. He even criticized Troy Brown of the New England Patriots and Deion Sanders of the Dallas Cowboys, two players who also have played both offense and defense. Bednarik noted that Brown and Sanders saw time at both wide receiver and cornerback, positions that did not require as much contact as he endured while playing both center and linebacker. He also believed a true two-way player had to play every down.

===Relationship with the Eagles===
Bednarik&#x27;s former Eagles number, 60, has been retired by the Eagles in honor of his achievements with the team and is one of only nine numbers retired in the history of the franchise.

When the Eagles established their Honor Roll in 1987, Bednarik was one of the first class of inductees. He attended reunions for the 25th anniversary of the 1960 NFL Championship team in 1985 and the 40th anniversary of the 1948–49 NFL Championship team in 1988 (though he had not played for the 1948 team), held in pregame ceremonies at Veterans Stadium.

Bednarik quarreled with current Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie in 1996. Lurie declined to buy 100 copies of Bednarik&#x27;s new book for $15 each for the entire team, as that was against NFL rules, and that grudge carried over into the Eagles&#x27; Super Bowl appearance in 2005, when he openly rooted against his former team. He later resolved his differences with Lurie. He was a consistent critic of several league issues, including his pension, today&#x27;s salaries, and one-way players.

During Eagles training camp in the summer of 2006, Bednarik and the Eagles reconciled, seemingly ending the feud between Bednarik and Lurie. At the same time, however, Bednarik made disparaging remarks regarding Reggie White, leading to a somewhat lukewarm reception of the reconciliation by Eagles&#x27; fans. In the edition of August 4 of Allentown&#x27;s &quot;Morning Call&quot; newspaper, however, it was reported that Bednarik apologized, stating he had been confused, and meant to make the statement about former Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens.

==Later life and death==

Bednarik was chairman of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission.

Bednarik died at 4:23 a.m. on March 21, 2015, in Coopersburg, Pennsylvania, after having fallen ill the previous day. He was 89. Although the Philadelphia Eagles released a statement saying he died after a &quot;brief illness&quot;, Bednarik&#x27;s eldest daughter, Charlene Thomas, disputed that claim, saying he had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and had been suffering from dementia for years and that football-related injuries played a role in his decline.

<text>The Dornier Do 13 was a short-lived 1930s German bomber design. It was the designation given to the aircraft resulting from attempts to improve on the Do 11. However, only a few were built, because the design changes caused serious problems, with many of the first flights ending in crashes. Another redesign ensued, resulting in the Do 23 and Do 13s under construction were converted to the Do 23 design.

<text>A counter pen is a pen designed to be affixed to the counter or table of an institution, such as a bank or a post office, typically by a chain, ball chain or plastic cord, making it less likely that the pen will be accidentally or purposefully removed.

A 1938 issue of &quot;The Bankers Monthly&quot; describes the concept: &quot;The pen also gives a better write than the ordinary counter pen. The ink stand cannot be stolen, for it is fastened to the counter or desk. Besides, a chain between pen and stand prevents anyone from wandering away with the pen.&quot;

<doc id="493671" wikidata="Q1245844" url="?curid=493671" title="Dornier Do 23">
<text>The Dornier Do 23 was a German medium bomber of the 1930s.

==Design and development==
The earlier Do 11 had exhibited several problems, so two initiatives were launched to address those shortcomings. The first resulted in the Do 13. The second effort was a more extensive rework which resulted in the Do 23. With additional landing flaps at the rear of the wings several of the handling problems were corrected, but crew and military equipment were analogous to the Do 11 and performance was still considered mediocre.

Between 1934 and 1935 282 Dornier Do 23s were built for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; of which 273 were assigned to the units. In 1936 the machines were replaced by the first versions of the Do 17 and were transferred to the training duties. During the war, some Do 23s were used as minesweepers, known as &quot;Minensuch&quot; — literally, &quot;mine-search&quot; aircraft in German — and fitted with a current-carrying degaussing ring under the airframe to create a magnetic field that triggered submerged naval mines. These aircraft were usually given an -&quot;MS&quot; suffix to designate them, as had been done with the similarly equipped Bv 138 MS or Ju 52MS aircraft.

Experiments with spraying devices to blow off chemical warfare agents were also carried out with Do 23 with some aircraft used to fight pests.

==Variants==
First aircraft received letters A, C, E and F which were designation of aircraft, not variants. The only production version was G.

*Do 23A: Aircraft WNr.231, registered as D-2485.
*Do 23C: Aircraft WNr.293, registered as D-AHYL.
*Do 23E: Aircraft WNr.294, registered as D-AGIR.
*Do 23F: Aircraft WNr.295, used for stress and vibration tests.
*Do 23G: Production version, manufactured in the Dornier main plants in Wismar and Friedrichshafen. Henschel and Blohm &amp; Voss were also involved in the production with 24 aircraft each.

==Operators==
*Luftwaffe
*Royal Hungarian Air Force

<doc id="493677" wikidata="Q19826127" url="?curid=493677" title="United Kingdom in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004">
<text>The United Kingdom participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004, which was held on 20 November 2004 in Lillehammer, Norway. National broadcaster ITV was responsible for their participation and organised a national final to select the British entry. Ultimately, Cory Spedding was selected with the song &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;.

The British entry was selected to perform thirteenth in the running order, following the entry from Latvia and preceding the entry from Denmark. The United Kingdom finished in second position with 140 points, which remains the UK&#x27;s highest placing in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest as of 2023.

==Before Junior Eurovision==

=== &quot;Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004: The British Final&quot; ===
A national final was held by Independent Television (ITV) to select the UK entry for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004. The final, broadcast on digital channel ITV2, was held on 4 September 2004 at the Granada Studios in Manchester and was presented by Holly Willoughby, Stephen Mulhern and Michael Underwood. Regional televoting was held to select the winner from the eight competing acts.

==At Junior Eurovision==
The 2004 Eurovision Song Contest was initially to be held in Manchester. However, ITV abandoned the project due to finance and scheduling problems. It was therefore moved to Lillehammer in Norway.

On the night of the contest, Cory Spedding performed 13th in the running order of the contest, following Latvia and preceding Denmark. At the close of the voting Cory received 140 points, placing 2nd of the 18 competing entries, beaten by María Isabel of Spain.

In the United Kingdom, the show was televised on digital channel ITV2 (due to poor viewing figures the previous year) with commentary by Matt Brown. The British spokesperson, who announced the British votes during the final, was national finalist Charlie Allan. A delayed broadcast, consisting of highlights, was aired on ITV1 the following afternoon.

<text>The cincture is a rope-like or ribbon-like article sometimes worn with certain Christian liturgical vestments, encircling the body around or above the waist. As usual with vestments, both the term and the object are taken from ordinary everyday dress of the distant past. There are two types of cinctures: one is a rope-like narrow girdle or rope-like belt around the waist. The other type is a broad ribbon of cloth that runs around the waist and usually has a section that hangs down from the waist; this type is often called a &quot;band cincture&quot; - it would be a &quot;waist-sash&quot; in secular contexts. One or both (or other) types are often used in various Christian denominations. Both types are used in the various Western rites of the Catholic Church and provinces of the Anglican Communion. Consecrated members of the various Eastern rites, whether in the Catholic Church, or in the various Orthodox communions, sometimes wear a belt referred to as a &quot;zone&quot;.

In the Western rites of the Catholic Church, as a matter of customary terminology, the term cincture is most often applied to a long, rope-like cord with tasseled or knotted ends, tied around the waist outside the alb. The colour may be white, or may vary according to the colour of the liturgical season. A Catholic bishop&#x27;s cincture is made of intertwining gold and green threads, a cardinal&#x27;s has red and gold, and the pope&#x27;s with white and gold. When the cincture is tied in the front and the ends draped on either side, it is called a Roman Knot.

The same rope-like vestment is widely used in the Anglican, Methodist and Lutheran churches, as well as some other Protestant churches. The band cincture in the Roman Catholic Church is usually known as the &quot;fascia&quot;.

<text>Timothy Joseph Penny (born November 19, 1951) is an American author, musician, and former politician from Minnesota. Penny was a Democratic-Farmer-Labor member of the United States House of Representatives, 1983–1995, representing Minnesota&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the 98th, 99th, 100th, 101st, 102nd and 103rd congresses.

==Early life==
Penny was born in Albert Lea, Minnesota, and was educated at Winona State College, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science in 1974. He was a member of the Minnesota Senate, 1976–1982. Penny served in the United States Naval Reserve and was commissioned a lieutenant commander.

==Political career==
In 1982, Penny won the DFL nomination for the 1st District and upset four-term 2nd District Republican Tom Hagedorn, becoming only the third Democrat to represent this district. Leading up to the election, Republicans were divided after the conservative Hagedorn narrowly defeated two-term First District moderate incumbent, Rep. Arlen Erdahl, in a contentious Republican Convention endorsement contest after redistricting; in addition, Democrats made large gains in congressional elections across the country, which contributed to Penny&#x27;s victory. Penny was reelected in 1984 with 56 percent of the vote, becoming the first non-Republican to win reelection in the district since statehood. He never faced another contest nearly that close, winning four more times by an average of 70 percent of the vote.

Penny was a somewhat conservative Democrat; he opposed gun control and abortion (though he has since become pro-choice). These stances were typical for a mostly rural district in southern Minnesota. He was best known for his work on fiscal policy. Although he had built a nearly unbreakable hold on his district, he announced in 1994 that he would not run for a seventh term. After Jesse Ventura was elected governor in 1998, Penny served an informal advisory role to the governor and assisted with the gubernatorial transition team.

==2002 Minnesota gubernatorial election==
Governor Ventura decided not to stand for reelection in 2002. In July of that year, Penny joined the Independence Party and presented himself as a &quot;sensible center&quot;, which resulted in winning the Independence nomination. Polls indicated a dead heat between him, DFL candidate Roger Moe, and Republican candidate Tim Pawlenty less than a month before the election. His running mate for the election was state senator Martha Robertson of Minnetonka, a moderate Republican. Polls in October had Penny in a near threeway tie. In the end, Penny was unsuccessful in his campaign, finishing with 16% of the vote.

==Electoral history==
*2002 Race for Governor
**Tim Pawlenty (R), 44%
**Roger Moe (DFL), 36%
**Tim Penny (IPM.), 16%
**Ken Pentel (Grn), 2%

==Post-Congressional career==

In 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for president and Independence Party candidate former senator Dean Barkley for US Senate.

Penny is president of the Southern Minnesota Initiative Foundation. He is also a senior fellow at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Humphrey Institute. He served for a time as the institute&#x27;s co-director alongside one of his former congressional colleagues, Republican Vin Weber.

He serves on the advisory board of the Institute for Law and Politics at the University of Minnesota Law School and is on the board of directors for the Energy Literacy Advocates. Penny also serves as vice chairman of the board of directors of ACDI/VOCA, a nonprofit U.S. international development organization. In addition, he is a co-chair of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

==Personal life==

Penny lives in Owatonna, Minnesota and has four children. He is the lead singer and guitarist in a band called Led Penny.

==Writings==
Penny is the co-author of three books, &quot;Payment Due&quot; (1996), &quot;Common Cents: A Retiring Six-Term Congressman Reveals How Congress Really Works — And What We Must Do to Fix It&quot; (1995), and &quot;The 15 Biggest Lies in Politics&quot; (1998). He is the lead author of &quot;The Road to Generational Equity&quot;, a manifesto that political analyst John Avlon characterizes as radical centrist.

<doc id="493684" wikidata="Q1268463" url="?curid=493684" title="Dwight Clark">
<text>Dwight Edward Clark (January 8, 1957 – June 4, 2018) was an American professional football wide receiver who played for nine seasons with the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1979 He was a member of San Francisco&#x27;s first two Super Bowl championship teams.

He caught the winning touchdown pass thrown by quarterback Joe Montana in the NFC Championship Game on January 10, 1982, against the Dallas Cowboys. The play, immortalized as &quot;the Catch&quot;, propelled the 49ers to their first Super Bowl championship. Clark played college football for the Clemson Tigers and was selected by the 49ers in the tenth round of the 1979 NFL draft. He served as the general manager of the 49ers from 1995 to 1998 and in the same capacity with the Cleveland Browns from 1999 to 2001.

==Early life==
Clark was born on January 8, 1957, in Kinston, North Carolina. He graduated from Garinger High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he played quarterback.

==College career==
At , Clark&#x27;s first love was basketball, but he accepted a scholarship to play college football at Clemson University.

As a freshman, Clark was moved to wide receiver, because the team had recruited four other quarterbacks. As a sophomore, he was named the starter at strong safety, but he disliked the position and left school to go back to his hometown in Charlotte instead. Clark was unhappy and considered transferring to play basketball at Appalachian State University, until he was finally allowed to play offense. After returning to the team, he was a backup wide receiver and finished with five receptions for 99 yards and a 19.8-yard average.

As a junior, Clark was named a starter at wide receiver and was part of the team that qualified Clemson to the Gator Bowl, its first bowl game in 18 years. He was third on the team with 17 receptions for 265 yards and one touchdown.

In Clark&#x27;s senior season in 1978, the Tigers were won the Gator Bowl over Ohio State, and finished sixth in the final AP poll. He was second on the team with 11 receptions for 207 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a career-high 68-yard touchdown catch against the University of Maryland that helped the Tigers win the ACC Championship.

At Clemson, Clark wore #30, posting only 33 catches for 571 yards, three touchdowns and a 17.3-yard average (seventh in school history). Unheralded as a collegian playing alongside wide receiver Jerry Butler, Clark felt fortunate to get to 

In 1988, Clark was inducted into the Clemson Hall of Fame. In 2018, he was inducted into the South Carolina Football Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
The San Francisco 49ers selected Clark with the first pick of the tenth round (249th overall) of the 1979 NFL draft, even though some people in the organization questioned the selection at the time, considering he was seen as an undrafted free agent. New head coach Bill Walsh had visited Clemson to scout quarterback Steve Fuller, Clark&#x27;s roommate. When the 49er contingent arrived on campus, Clark answered the phone by chance on his way out to play golf and was convinced to participate as Fuller&#x27;s pass catcher at the workout, where Walsh was impressed with his 

The 49ers were in 1978 and had the same record in 1979. But they soon greatly improved, winning the Super Bowl at the ends of the 1981 and 1984 seasons, and, starting in 1981, making the playoffs every year Clark was with them except 1982.

Clark tallied 506 catches for 6,750 yards and 48 touchdowns, along with 50 rushing yards in his nine NFL seasons with the 49ers. He led the NFL in receptions (60) during the strike-shortened 1982 season and made the Pro Bowl twice, in 1981 and 1982. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Paul Zimmerman named Clark his Player of the Year for 1982.

===The Catch===

In the 1981 NFC Championship game, on January 10, 1982, against the Dallas Cowboys, the 49ers trailed with 58 seconds to play. On 3rd-and-3, Clark leaped and caught a 6-yard pass from quarterback Joe Montana in the back of the end zone to tie the score, and Ray Wersching&#x27;s extra-point kick advanced the 49ers to Super Bowl XVI. That play, one of the most famous in the history of the NFL, has been immortalized as &quot;The Catch&quot;. Clark finished the game with eight receptions for 120 yards and two touchdowns. During the 1981 season, Walsh had Montana practice that part of the play back in training camp. Montana said, &quot;We&#x27;d never thrown the ball to Dwight on that play, at all.&quot; In the early 1990s, Clark&#x27;s catch had become the most requested clip in the archives of NFL Films, which was charging up to $5,000 for its use.

===Retirement and legacy===
After nine seasons with the 49ers, Clark retired following the 1987 season. He was a member of two Super Bowl-winning teams (XVI and XIX). To honor his contribution to 49ers, the club retired his #87 in 1988. He served as a team executive for the 49ers until 1998, when he resigned to become the first general manager in the expansion era of the Cleveland Browns, after following Carmen Policy who would run the team under the ownership of Al Lerner. In their first draft in 1999, the Browns went for quarterback Tim Couch, deciding to reject the calls from the Saints that offered their entire array of draft picks in order to try and draft Ricky Williams. He was executive vice president and director of football operations from On May 14, 2002, he resigned from his position with the Browns after new head coach Butch Davis requested the right to make personnel decisions. In the 2018 NFL Films documentary &quot;Dwight Clark: A Football Life&quot;, he was quoted as saying that it was probably a mistake to have accepted the position. He would later return to North Carolina to run his real estate business.

Clark built his restaurant, Clark&#x27;s By The Bay, the year he retired and decorated it with sports memorabilia including The Catch. Initially serving Cajun food, it later switched to prime rib and seafood. Located in Redwood City, California, the restaurant was sold in 1993.

===Media appearances===
Clark joined his 49er teammates Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott, and Riki Ellison in performing backup vocals on Huey Lewis and the News hit songs &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot; and &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; for the band&#x27;s &quot;Fore!&quot; album. Huey Lewis later indicated he was impressed by Clark&#x27;s singing abilities. Clark later took the lead role in the 1993 direct-to-video comedy &quot;Kindergarten Ninja&quot;. He also appeared in the video game &quot;All-Pro Football 2K8&quot;. He joined Comcast SportsNet Bay Area in 2011 as an analyst for &quot;49ers Postgame Live&quot;. Post-retirement, Clark expressed remorse about the end of Candlestick Park, saying that &quot;It was a dump [but] it was our dump, so we could talk bad about it, but we didn&#x27;t want anybody else to talk bad about it.&quot;

==NFL career statistics==

==Personal life==
Clark dated Miss Universe Shawn Weatherly from 1978 to 1982.

Clark met Ashley Stone in 1982; they married the following year. He had three children with Stone: a daughter, Casey, and two sons, Riley and Mac. They divorced in 2009.
Clark married Kelly Radzikowski in 2011. They moved to Santa Cruz.

==Illness and death==

On March 19, 2017, Clark announced that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. He stated that he believed he developed ALS as a result of playing football; he suffered three concussions during his playing career. &quot;I&#x27;ve been asked if playing football caused this,&quot; Clark wrote. &quot;I don&#x27;t know for sure. But I certainly suspect it did. And I encourage the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) and the NFL to continue working together in their efforts to make the game of football safer, especially as it relates to head trauma.&quot;

Clark died of the disease on June 4, 2018. At the time of his death, Clark lived in Whitefish, Montana, with his wife Kelly. He was the father-in-law of former NHL defenseman Peter Harrold. Clark had a close friendship with former 49ers owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. DeBartolo sent Clark to Japan in 2017 to bring back a three-month supply of the drug Radicava before it became available in the United States.

<text>The Open Document Architecture (ODA) and interchange format (informally referred to as just ODA) is a free and open international standard document file format maintained by the ITU-T to replace all proprietary document file formats. ODA is detailed in the standards documents CCITT T.411-T.424, which is equivalent to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 8613.

== Format ==
ODA defines a compound document format that can contain raw text, raster images and vector graphics. In the original release the difference between this standard and others like it is that the graphics structures were exclusively defined as CCITT raster image and Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM - ISO/IEC 8632). This was to limit the problem of having word processor and desktop publisher software be required to interpret all known graphics formats.

The documents have both logical and layout structures. Logically the text can be partitioned into chapters, footnotes and other subelements akin to HTML, and the layout fill a function similar to Cascading Style Sheets in the web world. The binary transport format for an ODA-conformant file is called &quot;Open Document Interchange Format&quot; (ODIF) and is based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language and Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1).

One of the features of this standard could be stored or interchanged in one of three formats: Formatted, Formatted Processable, or Processable. The latter two are editable formats. The first is an uneditable format that is logically similar to Adobe Systems PDF that is in common use today.

== History ==
In 1985, ESPRIT financed a pilot implementation of the ODA concept, involving, among others, Bull corporation, Olivetti, ICL and Siemens AG.

The intent was to have a universal storable and interchangeable document structure that would not go out of date and could be used by any word processor or desktop publisher. The rapid adoption of personal computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s by consumers and small businesses and the relative ease of writing applications for the primitive early PCs had resulted in a huge number of new word processing applications that were then duking it out around the world for market dominance. At the same time, large corporations who had purchased dedicated word processor devices in the 1970s were switching over to the new PCs that could run word processing software and much more. The result was a profusion of constantly evolving proprietary file formats. It was already clear by 1985 that this confusing and often frustrating situation would get much worse before it got better, as desktop publishing and multimedia computing were already on the horizon.

Thus, ODA was intended to solve the problem of software applications whose developers were continually updating their native file formats to accommodate new features, which frequently broke backward compatibility. Older native formats were repeatedly becoming obsolete and therefore unusable after only a few years. This led to a large financial impact on companies that were using &quot;ad hoc&quot; standard applications, such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, because their IT departments had to constantly assist frustrated users with transferring content between so many different formats, and also hire employees whose sole job was to import old stored documents into the latest version of applications before they became unreadable. The intended result of the ODA standard was that companies would not have to commit to an &quot;ad hoc&quot; standard for word processor or desktop publisher applications, because any application adhering to a common open standard could be used to read and edit long stored documents.

The initial round of documents that made up ISO 8613 was completed after a multi-year effort at an ISO/IEC JTC1/SC18/WG3 meeting in Paris La Defense, France, around Armistice (Nov. 11) 1987, called &quot;Office Document Architecture&quot; at the time. CCITT picked them up as the T.400 series of recommendations, using the term &quot;Open Document Architecture&quot;. Work continued on additional parts for a while, for instance at an ISO working group meeting in Ottawa in February 1989. Improvements and additions were continually being made. The revised standard was finally published in 1999. However, no significant developer of document application software chose to support the format, probably because the conversion from the existing dominant word processor formats such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word was difficult, offered little fidelity, and would only have weakened their advantage of vendor lock-in over their existing user base. There were also cultural obstacles because ODA was a predominantly European project that took a top-down design approach. It was unable to garner significant interest from the American software developer community or trade press. Finally, it took an extraordinarily long time to release the ODA format (the pilot was financed in 1985, but the final specification not published until 1999). Given a lack of products that supported the format, in part because of the excessive time used to create the specification, few users were interested in using it. Eventually interest in the format faded.

IBM&#x27;s European Networking Center (ENC) in Heidelberg, Germany, developed prototype extensions to IBM OfficeVision/VM to support ODA, in particular a converter between ODA and Document Content Architecture (DCA) document formats.

It would be improper to call ODA anything but a failure, but its spirit clearly influenced latter-day document formats that were successful in gaining support from many document software developers and users. These include the already-mentioned HTML and CSS as well as XML and XSL leading up to OpenDocument and Office Open XML.

<text>The North African campaign of World War II took place in North Africa from 10 June 1940 to 13 May 1943, fought between the Allies and the Axis Powers. It included campaigns in the Libyan and Egyptian deserts (Western Desert campaign, Desert War), in Morocco and Algeria (Operation Torch), and in Tunisia (Tunisia campaign). The Allied war effort was dominated by the British Commonwealth and exiles from German-occupied Europe. The United States officially entered the war in December 1941 and began direct military assistance in North Africa on 11 May 1942.

Fighting in North Africa started with the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940. On 14 June, the British 11th Hussars and part of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, (1st RTR) crossed the border from Egypt into Libya and captured Fort Capuzzo. This was followed by an Italian counter-offensive into Egypt and the capture of Sidi Barrani in September. The British recaptured Sidi Barrani in December during Operation Compass. The Italian 10th Army was destroyed and the German &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; was dispatched to North Africa in February 1941 in Operation Sonnenblume to reinforce the Italians and prevent an Axis defeat.

Battles for control of Libya and Egypt followed, with advances and retreats until the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 when the Eighth Army (Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery) defeated the German–Italian and forced its remnants into Tunisia. After Operation Torch, the Anglo-American landings in North-West Africa in November 1942 and fighting against Vichy France forces (which then changed sides), the Allies trapped about 250,000 German and Italian personnel in northern Tunisia, forcing their surrender in May 1943.

Information gleaned via British Ultra code-breaking was important in the Allied victory in North Africa. The Italian campaign followed, culminating in the downfall of the Fascist government in Italy and the elimination of Germany&#x27;s main European ally. German and Italian forces committed atrocities against prisoners of war and Jewish, Berber and Arab populations.

== Western Desert campaign ==
On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht started the Battle of France (or &quot;Westfeldzug&quot;). Six weeks later, France surrendered. The Armistice at Compiègne took place on 22 June 1940 leaving the Vichy government in control of French territory not occupied by Germany. This included all of French North Africa. On 10 June, Italy aligned itself with Nazi Germany and declared war upon France and the United Kingdom. British forces (along with Indian and Rhodesian troops) based in Egypt were ordered to take defensive measures, but to avoid provocation as much as possible. However, on 11 June they began a series of raids against Italian positions in Libya. Following the defeat of France on 25 June, Italian forces in Tripolitania – facing French troops based in Tunisia – redeployed to Cyrenaica to reinforce the Italian Tenth Army. This, coupled with the steadily degrading equipment of the British forces, led General Archibald Wavell to order an end to the raids and place the defence of the Egyptian border with a small screening force.

Italian dictator Benito Mussolini ordered the Tenth Army to invade Egypt by 8 August. Two days later, no invasion having been launched, Mussolini ordered Marshal Graziani that, the moment German forces launched Operation Sea Lion to invade Great Britain, he was to attack. Beaten in the Battle of Britain, the German invasion never took place. On 8 September, the Italians – hampered by a lack of transport, enfeebled by the low level of training among officers, and weakened by the state of its supporting equipment – were ordered to invade Egypt the following day. The battle plan was to advance along the coastal road while limited armoured forces operated on the desert flank. To counter the Italian advance, Wavell ordered his screening forces to harass the advancing Italians, falling back towards Mersa Matruh, where the main British infantry force was based. Positioned on the desert flank was the 7th Armoured Division, which would strike at the flank of the Italian force.
By 16 September, the Italian force had advanced to Maktila, around west of Mersa Matruh, where they halted due to supply problems. Despite Mussolini urging them to carry on, Graziani ordered his men to dig in around Sidi Barrani, and fortified camps were established in forward locations; additional troops were also positioned behind the main force. In response to the dispersed Italian camps, the British planned a limited five-day attack, Operation Compass, to strike at these fortified camps one by one. The British Commonwealth force, totalling 36,000 men, attacked the forward elements of the 10-division-strong Italian army on 9 December. Following their initial success, the forces of Operation Compass pursued the retreating Italian forces. In January, the small port at Bardia was taken, soon followed by the seizure of the fortified port of Tobruk.

Some 40,000 Italians were captured in and around the two ports, with the remainder of the Tenth Army retreating along the coast road back to El Agheila. Richard O&#x27;Connor sent the 7th Armoured Division across the desert with a small reconnaissance group. It reached Beda Fomm some ninety minutes before the Italians, cutting off their retreat. Although they tried desperately to overcome the British force at the Battle of Beda Fomm, the Italians were unable to break through, and the remnants of the retreating army surrendered. Over ten weeks Allied forces had destroyed the Italian Tenth Army and reached El Agheila, taking 130,000 prisoners of war in the process.

Mussolini requested help from his German allies, while the Italian &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; (&quot;high command&quot;) speedily sent several large motorized and armoured forces to protect their colonies in North Africa. This greatly expanded reinforcement included the soon-to-be-renowned &quot;Ariete&quot; Armoured division under General Ettore Baldassarre. Meanwhile, the Germans hastily assembled a motorized force, whose lead elements arrived in Tripoli in February. This relatively small expeditionary force, termed the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; by Adolf Hitler, was placed under the command of Erwin Rommel. His orders were to reinforce the Italians and block Allied attempts to drive them out of the region. However, the initial commitment of only one panzer division and subsequently, no more than two panzer and one motorized divisions, indicated the limited extent of German involvement and commitment to this theatre of operations. The bulk of the reinforcements were Italian and therefore it was up to the Italians to do the bulk of the fighting. The forward Allied force – now named XIII Corps – adopted a defensive posture and over the coming months was built up, before most of its veteran forces were redeployed to Greece to counter the German invasion there. In addition, the 7th Armoured Division was withdrawn to the Nile delta. The veteran forces were replaced by inexperienced newcomers, ill-equipped to face German armour.
Although Rommel had been ordered to simply hold the line, an armoured reconnaissance soon became a full-fledged offensive from El Agheila in March. In March–April, Allied forces were forced back and leading general officers captured. The Australian 9th Infantry Division fell back to the fortress port of Tobruk, and the remaining British and Commonwealth forces withdrew a further east to the Libyan–Egyptian border. With Tobruk under siege by the main Italian-German force, a small battlegroup continued to press eastwards. Capturing Fort Capuzzo and Bardia in passing, it then advanced into Egypt, and by the end of April it had taken Sollum and the tactically important Halfaya Pass. Rommel garrisoned these positions, reinforcing the battle-group and ordering it onto the defensive.

Though isolated on land, Tobruk&#x27;s garrison continued to receive supplies and replacements, delivered by the Royal Navy at night. German and Italian forces did not have the strength or training to take the fortress. This created a supply problem for his forward units. His front-line positions at Sollum were at the end of an extended supply chain that stretched back to Tripoli and had to bypass the coast road at Tobruk. Further, he was constantly threatened with a breakout of the British forces at Tobruk. Without Tobruk in Axis hands, further advances into Egypt were impractical.

The Allies launched a small-scale counter-attack called Operation Brevity in an attempt to push Axis forces off the key passes at the border, with some initial success. However they could not hold the advance positions and followed &quot;Brevity&quot; up with a much larger-scale offensive, Operation Battleaxe intended to relieve the siege at Tobruk, but this operation also failed. Following the failure of Operation Battleaxe, Archibald Wavell was relieved of command and replaced by Claude Auchinleck. The Western Desert Force was reinforced with a second corps, XXX Corps, with the two corps forming the Eighth Army. Eighth Army was made up of army forces from the Commonwealth nations, including the British Army, the Australian Army, the Indian Army, the New Zealand Army, the South African Army, and the Sudan Defence Force. There was also a brigade of Free French under Marie-Pierre Koenig.
The new formation launched a new offensive, Operation Crusader, in November. After a see-saw battle, the 70th Division garrisoning Tobruk was relieved and the Axis forces were forced to fall back. By January 1942, the front line was again at El Agheila.

After receiving supplies and reinforcements from Tripoli, the Axis attacked again, defeating the Allies in the Battle of Gazala in June and capturing Tobruk. The Axis forces drove the Eighth Army back over the Egyptian border, but their advance was stopped in July only from Alexandria in the First Battle of El Alamein.

Of great significance, on 29 June reports of British military operations in North Africa sent to Washington by the US military attaché in Cairo, Bonner Fellers, no longer used the compromised &quot;Black Code&quot; which the Axis forces had been reading, so the Axis could no longer learn of British &quot;strengths, positions, losses, reinforcements, supply, situation, plans, morale etc&quot; as they had since 1940.

General Auchinleck, although he had checked Rommel&#x27;s advance at the First Battle of El Alamein, was replaced by General Harold Alexander. Lieutenant-General William Gott was promoted from XIII Corps commander to command of the entire Eighth Army, but he was killed when his aircraft was intercepted and shot down over Egypt. He was replaced by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery.

At the end of June, Axis forces made a second attempt to break through the Allied defences at El Alamein at Alam Halfa, but were unsuccessful. After a lengthy period of build-up and training, the Eighth Army launched a major offensive, decisively defeating the Italian-German army in the Second Battle of El Alamein in late October, driving Axis forces west and capturing Tripoli in mid-January 1943. By February, the Eighth Army was facing the Italian-German &quot;Panzer&quot; Army near the Mareth Line and came under command of Alexander&#x27;s 18th Army Group for the concluding phase of the war in North Africathe Tunisia campaign.

==Operation Torch==
Operation Torch in November 1942 was a compromise operation that met the British objective of securing victory in North Africa while allowing American armed forces the opportunity to engage in the fight against Nazi Germany on a limited scale. In addition, as Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, had long been pleading for a second front to be opened to engage the Wehrmacht and relieve pressure on the Red Army, it provided some degree of relief for the Red Army on the Eastern Front by diverting Axis forces to the North African theatre. Over half the German Ju 52 transport planes that were needed to supply the encircled Axis forces at Stalingrad were tied up supplying Axis forces in North Africa.

Senior U.S. commanders were strongly opposed to proposed landings in North-West Africa. After the western Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) met in London on 30 July 1942 General George Marshall and Admiral Ernest King declined to approve the plan. Marshall and other U.S. generals advocated the invasion of northern Europe later that year, which the British rejected. After Prime Minister Winston Churchill pressed for a landing in French North Africa in 1942, Marshall suggested instead to President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the U.S. abandon the Germany first strategy and take the offensive in the Pacific. Roosevelt said it would do nothing to help Russia. With Marshall unable to persuade the British to change their minds, President Roosevelt gave a direct order that Operation Torch was to have precedence over other operations and was to take place at the earliest possible date, one of only two direct orders he gave to military commanders during the war.

The landings started on 8 November, and finished on 16 November. In an attempt to pincer German and Italian forces, Allied forces (American and British Commonwealth) landed in Vichy-held French North Africa under the assumption that there would be little to no resistance. Nevertheless, Vichy French forces put up a strong and bloody resistance to the Allies in Oran and Morocco, but not in Algiers, where a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by the French resistance on 8 November succeeded in neutralizing the French XIX Corps before the landing and arresting the Vichy commanders. Consequently, the landings met no practical opposition in Algiers, and the city was captured on the first day along with the entire Vichy African command. After three days of talks and threats, Generals Mark Clark and Dwight Eisenhower compelled Vichy Admiral François Darlan and General Alphonse Juin to order the cessation on 10–11 November of armed resistance from Vichy forces in Oran and Morocco, promising to make Darlan the head of a Free French administration. During Operation Torch, Americans fought Vichy French and German navy vessels in the Naval Battle of Casablanca, which ended in an American victory.

The Allied landings prompted the Axis occupation of Vichy France (Case Anton) including an attempt to capture the French fleet at Toulon, which did them little good, as the main portion of the fleet was scuttled to prevent their use by the Axis.

The Vichy Army in North Africa joined the Allies.

== Tunisian campaign ==

Following the Operation Torch landings – from early November 1942 – the Germans and Italians initiated a buildup of troops in Tunisia to fill the vacuum left by Vichy troops which had withdrawn. During this period of weakness, the Allies decided against a rapid advance into Tunisia while they wrestled with the Vichy authorities. Many of the Allied soldiers were tied up in garrison duties because of the uncertain status and intentions of the Vichy forces.
By mid-November, the Allies were able to advance into Tunisia, but only in single division strength. By early December, the Eastern Task Force – which had been redesignated as the British First Army under Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson – was composed of the British 78th Infantry Division, British 6th Armoured Division, 1st Parachute Brigade, No. 6 Commando and elements of US 1st Armored Division. But by this time, one German and five Italian divisions had been shipped from Europe and the remoteness of Allied airfields from the front line gave the Axis clear air superiority over the battlefield. The Allies were halted and pushed back having advanced eastwards to within of Tunis.

In early December, the Allies were met with the reality that they would not be successful in capturing the key cities of Tunis and Bizerta. The air campaigns by the Axis forces proved to be a difficult challenge for the British forces. However, the Allies were left with the advantage of having secured the island of Malta, enabling the Allies to carry out future aerial operations. Additionally, on land, allied British and American forces were able to hold onto their possessions. On December 4, 1942, the Allied Force Headquarters in North Africa reported that military operations were ongoing in the Tebourba area. The Axis powers attempted a second counter-attack in the neighborhood of Tebourba following their failed attempt on December 1. The attack was successfully repulsed by the Allied powers, and the enemy sustained significant damage to their weaponry. During the winter, there followed a period of stalemate during which time both sides continued to build up their forces. By the new year, the British First Army had one British, one US and one French Corps (a second British Corps headquarters was activated in April). In the second half of February, in eastern Tunisia, the Axis had some successes against the mainly inexperienced French and US troops, most notably in routing the US II Corps commanded by Major General Lloyd Fredendall at the Battle of Kasserine Pass.

By the beginning of March, the British Eighth Army – advancing westward along the North African coast – had reached the Tunisian border. Rommel and von Arnim found themselves in an Allied &quot;two army&quot; pincer. They were outflanked, outmanned and outgunned. Rommel went back to Germany for health reasons and was substituted by the Italian general Messe.

The British Eighth Army bypassed the Axis defence on the Mareth Line in late March after harsh fighting and First Army in central Tunisia launched their main offensive in mid-April to squeeze the Axis forces until their resistance in Africa collapsed. The Axis forces surrendered on 13 May 1943 yielding over 275,000 prisoners of war. The last Axis force to surrender in North Africa was the 1st Italian Army of General Messe. This huge loss of experienced troops greatly reduced the military capacity of the Axis powers, although some Axis troops escaped Tunisia. This defeat in Africa led to all Italian colonies in Africa being captured.

== Intelligence ==
=== Axis ===

The Axis had considerable success in intelligence gathering through radio communication intercepts and monitoring unit radio traffic. The most important success came through intercepting the reports of Fellers, the US military attaché in Egypt. He had been tasked by Marshall with providing detailed reports on the military situation in Africa. Fellers talked with British military and civilian headquarters personnel, read documents and visited the battlefront. Known to the Germans as &quot;die gute Quelle&quot; (the good source) or more jokingly as &#x27;the little fellow&#x27;, he transmitted his reports back to Washington using the &quot;Black Code&quot; of the US State Department. However, in September 1941, the Italians had stolen a code book containing the Black Code, photographed it and returned it to the US embassy in Rome. The Italians shared parts of their intercepts with their German allies. In addition the &quot;Chiffrierabteilung&quot; (German military cipher branch) were soon able to break the code. Fellers&#x27; reports were very detailed and played a significant role in informing the Germans of allied strength and intentions between January and June 1942

In addition, the Italian &quot;Servizio Informazioni Segrete&quot; or SIS code-breakers were able to successfully intercept much radio encrypted signals intelligence (SIGINT) from British aircraft traffic as well as first-class ciphers from British vessels and land bases, providing Supermarina (Regia Marina) with timely warnings of Allied intentions in the Mediterranean. Indeed, so successful was the Italian SIS in handling the bulk of Axis naval intelligence in the Mediterranean, that &quot;Britain&#x27;s offensive use of SIGINT was largely negated by Italy&#x27;s defensive SIGINT.&quot;

The Afrika Korps had the intelligence services of the 621st Signals Battalion mobile monitoring element which arrived in North Africa in late April 1941, commanded by Hauptmann Alfred Seeböhm. The 621st Signals Battalion monitored radio communications among British units. Unfortunately for the Allies, the British not only failed to change their codes with any frequency, they were also prone to poor radio discipline in combat. Their officers made frequent open, uncoded transmissions to their commands, allowing the Germans to more easily identify British units and deployments. The situation changed after a counterattack during the Battle of Gazala resulted in the 621st Signals Battalion being overrun and destroyed, and a number of their documents captured, alerting British intelligence to the problem. The British responded by instituting an improved call signal procedure, introducing radiotelephonic codes, imposing rigid wireless silence on reserve formations, padding out real messages with dummy traffic, tightening up on their radio discipline in combat and creating an entire fake signals network in the southern sector.

=== Allies ===

Allied codebreakers read much enciphered German message traffic, especially that encrypted with the Enigma machine. The Allies&#x27; Ultra programme was initially of limited value, as it took too long to get the information to the commanders in the field, and at times provided information that was less than helpful. In terms of anticipating the next move the Germans would make, reliance on Ultra sometimes backfired. Part of the reason the initial German attacks in March 1941 were so successful was that Ultra intercepts had informed Wavell that OKW had clearly directed Rommel not to take any offensive action, but to wait until he was further reinforced with the 15th Panzer Division in May. Rommel received this information, but placed more value on his own assessment of the situation. Trusting that the Germans had no intention of taking major action, the British command did not respond until it was too late. Furthermore, Rommel did not generally provide OKW or the Italian &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; details of his planned operations, for he thought the Italians too prone to leak the information. Thus on 21 January 1942, when Rommel struck out on his second offensive from El Agheila, &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; was just as surprised to learn of it as the British were. Ultra intercepts provided the British with such information as the name of the new German commander, his time of arrival, and the numbers and condition of the Axis forces, but they might not correctly reveal Rommel&#x27;s intentions.
The primary benefit of Ultra intercepts to the effort in North Africa was to aid in cutting the Axis supply line to Tunisia. Ultra intercepts provided valuable information about the times and routes of Axis supply shipments across the Mediterranean. This was critical in providing the British with the opportunity to intercept and destroy them. During the time when Malta was under heavy air attack, the ability to act on this information was limited, but as Allied air and naval strength improved, the information became instrumental to Allied success. It is estimated that 40% to 60% of Axis supply shipping was located and destroyed due to decrypted information. However, this claim is strongly disputed by the authors Vincent P. O&#x27;Hara and Enrico Cernuschi (2013) who claim that historians like F.H. Hinsley have greatly exaggerated the effects of Ultra. For example, they claim that intelligence provided by Ultra had little impact in stopping Italian convoys reaching North Africa. Of the 2.67 million tons of materiel, fuel, and munitions shipped to Africa – nearly all in Italian vessels and under Italian escort – 2.24 million tons managed to arrive despite the best efforts of Ultra and the British Navy to prevent it. In effect, &quot;Ultra did not deny the Axis armies the supplies they needed to reach the Nile.&quot;

Heavy losses of German paratroopers during the Battle of Crete, made possible by Ultra warnings of the drop times and locations, meant that Hitler hesitated in attacking Malta, which aided the British in gaining control of the Mediterranean, as did the losses of the Italian Navy at the Battle of Cape Matapan. To conceal the fact that German coded messages were being read, a fact critical to the overall Allied war effort, British command required a flyover mission be carried out before a convoy could be attacked in order to give the appearance that a reconnaissance flight had discovered the target.

== Atrocities ==

The North African campaign was often labeled a &quot;war without hate&quot;, a pure military clash in the desert without the partisan murders and ethnic cleansing that was occurring across Europe. This view has been challenged by recent historians, given that there were indeed many civilians who lived in the region and the campaign was marked by numerous atrocities and abuses by both Italian and German forces towards Allied prisoners of war and local Jewish, Berber, and Arab populations.

== Aftermath ==

After victory by the Allies in the North African campaign, the stage was set for the Italian campaign to begin. The invasion of Sicily followed two months later. Nearly 400,000 Axis and Allied troops were lost, injured or died of disease by the end of the North African campaign.

<text>The Italian campaign of World War II, also called the Liberation of Italy following the German occupation in September 1943, consisted of Allied and Axis operations in and around Italy, from 1943 to 1945. The joint Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) was operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the Mediterranean theatre and it planned and led the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, followed in September by the invasion of the Italian mainland and the campaign in Italy until the surrender of the Axis forces in Italy in May 1945.

The invasion of Sicily in July 1943 led to the collapse of the Fascist Italian regime and the fall of Mussolini, who was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July. The new government signed an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943. However, German forces soon invaded northern and central Italy, committing several atrocities against Italian civilians and army units who opposed the German occupation and started the Italian resistance movement. Mussolini, who was rescued by German paratroopers, established a collaborationist puppet state, the Italian Social Republic (RSI), to administer the German-occupied territory. On 13 October 1943, the Allies recognized Italy as a co-belligerent in the war against Germany. Thereafter, the Italian Co-Belligerent Army and the Italian partisans fought alongside the Allies against German troops and the collaborationist National Republican Army; an aspect of this period is the Italian civil war. In the summer of 1944, after the Axis defeats at Cassino and Anzio, central Italy, including Rome, was liberated. Northern Italy was liberated following the final spring offensive and the general insurrection of Italian partisans on 25 April 1945. Mussolini was captured by the Italian resistance and summarily executed by firing squad. The campaign ended when Army Group C surrendered unconditionally to the Allies on 2 May 1945, one week before the formal German Instrument of Surrender. Both sides committed war crimes during the conflict, and the independent states of San Marino and Vatican City surrounded by Italian territory also suffered damage.

It is estimated that between September 1943 and April 1945, 60,000–70,000 Allied and 38,805–50,660 German soldiers died in Italy. The number of Allied casualties was about 330,000 and the German figure (excluding those involved in the final surrender) was over 330,000. Fascist Italy, prior to its collapse, suffered about 200,000 casualties, mostly prisoners-of-war taken in the invasion of Sicily, including more than 40,000 killed or missing. Over 150,000 Italian civilians died, as did 35,828 anti-Nazi and anti-fascist partisans and some 35,000 troops of the Italian Social Republic. On the Western Front of World War II, Italy was the most costly campaign in terms of casualties suffered by infantry forces of both sides, during bitter small-scale fighting around strongpoints at the Winter Line, the Anzio beachhead and the Gothic Line. Casualties among infantry in Italy were proportionally higher than they were on the Western Front of WWI.

==Strategic background==
The British, especially the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, advocated their traditional naval-based peripheral strategy. Even with a large army, but greater naval power, the traditional British answer against a continental enemy was to fight as part of a coalition, blockading with their navy and mount small peripheral operations designed to gradually weaken the enemy. The United States, with the larger U.S. Army, favoured a more direct method of fighting the main force of the German Army in northwestern Europe. The ability to launch such a campaign depended on first winning the Battle of the Atlantic.

The strategic disagreement was fierce, with the U.S. service chiefs arguing for an invasion of France as early as possible, while their British counterparts advocated a policy centred on operations in the Mediterranean. There was even pressure from some Latin American countries to stage an invasion of Spain, which, under Francisco Franco, was friendly to the Axis nations, although not a participant in the war. The American staff believed that a full-scale invasion of France at the earliest possible time was required to end the war in Europe, and that no operations should be undertaken that might delay that effort.

Eventually the U.S. and British political leadership reached a compromise in which both would commit most of their forces to an invasion of France in early 1944, but also launch a relatively small-scale Italian campaign. A contributing factor was Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s desire to keep U.S. troops active in the European theatre during 1943 and his attraction to the idea of eliminating Italy from the war. It was hoped that an invasion might knock Italy out of the conflict, or at least increase the pressure on it and weaken it. The elimination of Italy would enable Allied naval forces, principally the Royal Navy, to dominate the Mediterranean Sea, securing the lines of communications with Egypt and thus Asia. Italian divisions on occupation and coastal defence duties in the Balkans and France would be withdrawn to defend Italy, while the Germans would have to transfer troops from the Eastern Front to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the Soviet Union.

==Campaign==
===Invasion of Sicily===
The initial plan was for landings in the south-east, south and north-west areas of the island which would lead to the rapid capture of key Axis airfields and except for Messina, all the main ports on the island. This would allow a rapid Allied build-up, as well as denying their use to the Axis. This was altered into a reduced number of landings but with more concentration of force.

The Allied invasion of Sicily, Operation Husky, began on 9 July 1943 with both amphibious and airborne landings at the Gulf of Gela. The land forces involved were the U.S. Seventh Army, under Lieutenant General George S. Patton, the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade under the command of Major-General Guy Simonds and the British Eighth Army, under General Bernard Montgomery.

The original plan required a strong advance by the British northwards along the east coast to Messina. The Canadians took the central position, with the British on their right and the Americans on the left. The Canadian War Cemetery in Agira is testament to the sacrifice made driving the Germans from the rugged terrain. The Americans had the important role of pushing Axis forces out of mainland Sicily on left flank. When the Eighth Army were held up by stubborn defences in the rugged hills south of Mount Etna, Patton amplified the American role with a wide advance northwest toward Palermo and then directly north to cut the northern coastal road. This was followed by an eastward advance north of Etna towards Messina, supported by a series of amphibious landings on the northern coast that propelled Patton&#x27;s troops into Messina shortly before the first units of the Eighth Army. The defending German and Italian forces were unable to prevent the Allied capture of the island, but they succeeded in evacuating most of their troops to the mainland, with the last leaving on 17 August 1943. The Allied forces gained experience in opposed amphibious operations, coalition warfare, and large airborne drops.

===Invasion of mainland Italy===
Forces of the British Eighth Army, still under Montgomery, landed in the &#x27;toe&#x27; of Italy on 3 September 1943 in Operation Baytown, the day the Italian government agreed to an armistice with the Allies. The armistice was publicly announced on 8 September by two broadcasts, first by General Eisenhower and then by a proclamation by Marshal Badoglio. Although the German forces prepared to defend without Italian assistance, only two of their divisions opposite the Eighth Army and one at Salerno were not tied up disarming the Royal Italian Army.

On 9 September, forces of the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, expecting little resistance, landed against heavy German resistance at Salerno in Operation Avalanche; in addition, British forces landed at Taranto in Operation Slapstick, which was almost unopposed. There had been a hope that, with the surrender of the Italian government, the Germans would withdraw to the north, since at the time Adolf Hitler had been persuaded that Southern Italy was strategically unimportant. However, this was not to be; although, for a while, the Eighth Army was able to make relatively easy progress up the eastern coast, capturing the port of Bari and the important airfields around Foggia. Despite none of the northern reserves having been made available to the German 10th Army, it nevertheless came close to repelling the Salerno landing. The main Allied effort in the west initially centred on the port of Naples: that city was selected because it was the northernmost port that could receive air cover by fighter planes flying from Sicily. In the city itself, anti-Fascist Forces began an uprising, later known as the Four days of Naples, holding out despite continuous German reprisals until the arrival of Allied forces.

As the Allies advanced, they encountered increasingly difficult terrain: the Apennine Mountains form a spine along the Italian peninsula offset somewhat to the east. In the most mountainous areas of Abruzzo, more than half the width of the peninsula comprises crests and peaks over that are relatively easy to defend; and the spurs and re-entrants to the spine confronted the Allies with a succession of ridges and rivers across their line of advance. The rivers were subject to sudden and unexpected flooding, which had the potential to thwart the Allied commanders&#x27; plans.

===Allied advance on Rome===

In early October 1943, Hitler was persuaded by his Army Group Commander in Southern Italy, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, that the defence of Italy should be conducted as far away from Germany as possible. This would make the most of the natural defensive geography of Central Italy, whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields, each one being ever closer to Germany. Hitler was also convinced that yielding southern Italy would provide the Allies with a springboard for an invasion of the Balkans, with its vital resources of oil, bauxite, and copper.

Kesselring was given command of the whole of Italy and immediately ordered the preparation of a series of defensive lines across Italy, south of Rome. Two lines, the Volturno and the Barbara, were used to delay the Allied advance so as to buy time to prepare the most formidable defensive positions, which formed the &quot;Winter Line&quot; – the collective name for the Gustav Line and two associated defensive lines on the west of the Apennine Mountains, the Bernhardt and Hitler lines (the latter had been renamed the Senger Line by 23 May 1944).

The Winter Line proved a major obstacle to the Allies at the end of 1943, halting the Fifth Army&#x27;s advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army&#x27;s Adriatic front, and Ortona was liberated with heavy casualties to Canadian troops, the blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies&#x27; focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the Liri valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings behind the line at Anzio during Operation Shingle, advocated by Churchill, were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur because of disagreements that the American commander, Major General John P. Lucas, had with the battle plan, and his insistence that his forces were not large enough to accomplish their mission. Lucas entrenched his forces, during which time Kesselring assembled sufficient forces to form a ring around the beachhead. After a month of hard fighting against German and RSI forces, Lucas was replaced by Major General Lucian Truscott, who eventually broke out in May.

It took four major offensives between January and May 1944 before the line was eventually broken by a combined assault of the Fifth and Eighth Armies (including British, American, French, Polish, and Canadian corps) concentrated along a front between Monte Cassino and the western seaboard. In a concurrent action, Clark was ordered to break out of the stagnant position at Anzio and cash in on the opportunity to cut off and destroy a large part of the German 10th Army retreating from the Gustav Line between them and the Canadians. But this opportunity was lost on the brink of success, when Clark disobeyed his orders and sent his U.S. forces to enter the vacant Rome instead. Rome had been declared an open city by the German Army so no resistance was encountered.

The American forces took possession of Rome on 4 June 1944. The German 10th Army was allowed to get away and, in the next few weeks, may have been responsible for doubling the Allied casualties in the next few months.

===Allied advance into Northern Italy===

After the capture of Rome, and the Allied invasion of Normandy in June, the U.S. VI Corps and the French Expeditionary Corps (CEF), which together amounted to seven divisions, were pulled out of Italy during the summer of 1944 to participate in Operation Dragoon, codename for the Allied invasion of Southern France. The sudden removal of these experienced units from the Italian front was only partially compensated for by the gradual arrival of three divisions, the Brazilian 1st Infantry Division, the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division, both in the second half of 1944, and the U.S. 10th Mountain Division in January 1945.

In the period from June to August 1944, the Allies advanced beyond Rome, taking Florence and closing up on the Gothic Line. This last major defensive line ran from the coast some north of Pisa, along the jagged Apennine Mountains chain between Florence and Bologna to the Adriatic coast, just south of Rimini. In order to shorten the Allied lines of communication for the advance into Northern Italy, the Polish II Corps advanced towards the port of Ancona and, after a month-long battle, succeeded in capturing it on 18 July.

During &quot;Operation Olive&quot;, which commenced on 25 August, the Gothic Line defences were penetrated on both the Fifth and Eighth Army fronts; but, there was no decisive breakthrough. Churchill, the British Prime Minister, had hoped that a major advance in late 1944 would open the way for the Allied armies to advance northeast through the &quot;Ljubljana Gap&quot; (the area between Venice and Vienna, which is today&#x27;s Slovenia) to Vienna and Hungary to forestall the Red Army from advancing into Eastern Europe. Churchill&#x27;s proposal had been strongly opposed by the U.S. Chiefs of Staff, despite its importance to British postwar interests in the region, as they did not believe that it aligned with overall Allied war priorities.

In October, Lieutenant General Sir Richard McCreery succeeded Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese as the commander of the Eighth Army. In December, Lieutenant General Mark Clark, the Fifth Army commander, was appointed to command the 15th Army Group, thereby succeeding the British General Sir Harold Alexander as commander of all Allied ground troops in Italy; Alexander succeeded Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson as the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean Theatre. Clark was succeeded in command of the Fifth Army by now-Lieutenant General Truscott. In the winter and spring of 1944–45, extensive partisan activity in Northern Italy took place. As there were two Italian governments during this period, (one on each side of the war), the struggle took on some characteristics of a civil war.

The poor winter weather, which made armoured manoeuvre and the exploitation of overwhelming air superiority impossible, coupled with the massive losses suffered to its ranks during the autumn fighting, the need to transfer some British troops to Greece (as well as the need to withdraw the British 5th Infantry Division and I Canadian Corps to northwestern Europe) made it impractical for the Allies to continue their offensive in early 1945. Instead, the Allies adopted a strategy of &quot;offensive defence&quot; while preparing for a final attack when better weather and ground conditions arrived in the spring.

In late February-early March 1945, &quot;Operation Encore&quot; saw elements of the U.S. IV Corps (1st Brazilian Division and the newly arrived U.S. 10th Mountain Division) battling forward across minefields in the Apennines to align their front with that of the U.S. II Corps on their right. They pushed the German defenders from the commanding high point of Monte Castello and the adjacent Monte Belvedere and Castelnuovo, depriving them of artillery positions that had been commanding the approaches to Bologna since the narrowly failed Allied attempt to take the city in the autumn. Meanwhile, damage to other transport infrastructure forced Axis forces to use sea, canal and river routes for re-supply, leading to Operation Bowler against shipping in Venice harbour on 21 March 1945.

The Allies&#x27; final offensive commenced with massive aerial and artillery bombardments on 9 April 1945. The Allies had 1,500,000 men and women deployed in Italy in April 1945. The Axis on 7 April had 599,404 troops of which 439,224 were Germans and 160,180 were Italians. By 18 April, Eighth Army forces in the east had broken through the Argenta Gap and sent armour racing forward in an encircling move to meet the U.S. IV Corps advancing from the Apennines in Central Italy and to trap the remaining defenders of Bologna. On 21 April, Bologna was entered by the 3rd Carpathian Division, the Italian Friuli Group (both from the Eighth Army) and the U.S. 34th Infantry Division (from the Fifth Army). The U.S. 10th Mountain Division, which had bypassed Bologna, reached the River Po on 22 April; the 8th Indian Infantry Division, on the Eighth Army front, reached the river on 23 April.

By 25 April, the Italian Partisans&#x27; Committee of Liberation declared a general uprising, and on the same day, having crossed the Po on the right flank, forces of the Eighth Army advanced north-northeast towards Venice and Trieste. On the front of the U.S. Fifth Army, divisions drove north toward Austria and northwest to Milan. On the Fifth Army&#x27;s left flank, the U.S. 92nd Infantry Division (the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers Division&quot;) went along the coast to Genoa. A rapid advance towards Turin by the Brazilian division on their right took the Italo-German Army Liguria by surprise, causing its collapse.

Between 26 April and 1 May there were the Battles of Collecchio-Fornovo di Taro, which resulted in the surrender of the 148th German Infantry Division to Brazilian soldiers of the FEB; the Brazilian soldiers captured about 15,000 German and RSI soldiers, the end of these battles marked the end of the conflicts in Italy and the end of the Italian fascist army.

As April 1945 came to an end, the German Army Group C, retreating on all fronts and having lost most of its fighting strength, was left with little option but surrender. General Heinrich von Vietinghoff, who had taken command of Army Group C after Albert Kesselring had been transferred to become Commander-in-Chief of the Western Front (OB West) in March 1945, signed the instrument of surrender on behalf of German forces in Italy on 29 April, formally bringing hostilities to an end on 2 May 1945. On 1 May, a day before the Axis forces in Italy capitulated, Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, the Minister of Defense of the Italian Social Republic, which had sent a delegation to surrender the RSI units, ordered the Army Group Liguria to surrender.

===Progress of the campaign===
==War crimes==
=== Axis crimes ===

Research in 2016 funded by the German government found the number of victims of Nazi war crimes in Italy to be 22,000. The victims were primarily Italian civilians, sometimes in retaliation for partisan attacks, and Italian Jews.

Approximately 14,000 Italian non-Jewish civilians, often women, children and elderly, have been documented to have died in over 5,300 individual instances of war crimes committed by Nazi Germany. The largest of those was the Marzabotto massacre, where in excess of 770 civilians were murdered. The Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema massacre saw 560 civilians killed while the Ardeatine massacre saw 335 randomly selected people executed, among them 75 Italian Jews. In the Padule di Fucecchio massacre up to 184 civilians were executed.

===Allied crimes===

Allied war crimes during the conflict were reported, including killing of civilians (such as the Canicattì massacre), execution of prisoners (such as two massacres at Biscari airfield on 14 July 1943), and rape (most notably the &quot;marocchinate&quot;).

<text>The Cessna O-2 Skymaster (nicknamed &quot;Oscar Deuce&quot;) is a military version of the Cessna 337 Super Skymaster, used for forward air control (FAC) and psychological operations (PSYOPS) by the US military between 1967 and 2010.

==Design and development==
In 1966, the United States Air Force (USAF) commissioned Cessna to build a military variant of the Model 337 Skymaster to supplement the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog in the role of forward air control.

Both the civilian and military Skymasters were low-cost twin-engine piston-powered aircraft, with one engine in the nose of the aircraft and a second in the rear of the fuselage. The push-pull configuration provided centerline thrust, allowing simpler operation than the low-wing mounting of most twin-engine light aircraft, and allowed a high wing to be used, providing clear observation below and behind the aircraft.

Modifications made for the military configuration included fore-and-aft seating for a pilot and observer, instead of the six seats of the civilian version; installation of view panels in the doors (for improved ground observation); installation of flame-retardant foam in the wing-mounted fuel tanks (slightly increasing weight, and reducing maximum fuel capacity by 3%); installation of military, rather than civilian, communication and navigation equipment and antennas; removal of propeller spinners; increased gross weight (5,400 lb vs. 4,400 lb in civilian version), with component strengthening as required to support the increase; and removal of interior upholstery.

The O-2 first flew in January 1967, and the plane went into production shortly thereafter in March. Performance (especially at cruising altitudes) was degraded due to the added antennas and significant weight increase, but was considered sufficient for the anticipated low-level operation.

==Operational history==
===United States===
====U.S. Air Force====
The USAF took delivery of the O-2 Skymaster in March 1967 and the O-2A also entered the U.S. Army&#x27;s inventory during 1967, from USAF stock. By June 1970, when production stopped, a total of 532 O-2s had been built for the USAF.

During the Vietnam War, the O-2A was introduced as a replacement for the O-1 Bird Dog, in the forward air control (FAC) aircraft and served in that role with the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron. The O-2B was equipped with loudspeakers and a leaflet dispenser for use in the psychological operations (PSYOPS) role.

While it was intended that the Skymaster be replaced in the FAC mission by the OV-10 Bronco, the O-2A continued to be used for night missions after the OV-10&#x27;s introduction, due to the OV-10&#x27;s high level of cockpit illumination, rendering night reconnaissance impractical. The O-2 was phased out completely after additional night upgrades to the OV-10.

A total of 178 USAF O-2 Skymasters were lost in the Vietnam War, to all causes.

Following the Vietnam War, the O-2 continued to operate with both U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard units into the late 1980s.

====U.S. Navy====
Six former USAF O-2A airframes were transferred to the U.S. Navy in 1983 for use as range controllers with Attack Squadron 122 (VA-122), the Pacific Fleet Replacement Squadron for the A-7 Corsair II at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California. These aircraft were later transferred to Strike Fighter Squadron 125 (VFA-125), the F/A-18 Hornet FRS at NAS Lemoore, in 1986 for use in the same range control role. These O-2A aircraft were eventually replaced by T-34C Turbomentor aircraft transferred from the Naval Air Training Command.

====U.S. Army====
Of the six USN aircraft mentioned above, two were transferred to the U.S. Army in late 1990. USAF O-2As were augmented by the 1990 aircraft transfer from the Navy. Several disassembled USAF O-2s remain in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. Two O-2As were used at Laguna Army Airfield, Arizona as part of testing programs carried out by the Yuma Proving Ground. These were retired in October 2010 and sent to a museum.

=== South Vietnam ===
35 USAF O-2 aircraft were later transferred to and operated by the former Republic of Vietnam Air Force.

===El Salvador===
During the Salvadoran Civil War, the Salvadoran Air Force received a total of 23 O-2As and 2 O-2Bs from the United States, the first arriving in 1981. They were employed to observe the movements of FMLN formations and direct air strikes against them, playing a major role in forcing the rebel movement to abandon large-scale operations.

Near the end of the war in 1990, the rebels&#x27; acquisition of SA-7 missiles resulted in the loss of two O-2As, while another was destroyed by mortar fire, and two more were lost in crashes.

===Civilian use===
====CAL FIRE====
In the mid-1970s, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, found that the contractor-owned air attack aircraft, mostly single-engine Cessna 182s and Cessna 210s, did not provide the airspeed and safety needed for the department&#x27;s new air tanker program. In 1974, Senior Air Operations Officer Cotton Mason inspected 40 USAF O-2s at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The best 20 were selected and shipped to Fresno, California. These aircraft had been FAC aircraft in Vietnam and were shipped back to the United States in containers, and were disassembled and on pallets when they arrived at Fresno. A crew of California Conservation Corps (CCC) members under the supervision of a CDF Battalion Chief, who was an FAA Certificated Mechanic with Inspection Authorization (IA), reassembled the aircraft.

They were placed in service in 1976, and served CAL FIRE for more than 20 years, until replaced by a fleet of OV-10 Broncos.

<doc id="493703" wikidata="Q968798" url="?curid=493703" title="Paul Brown">
<text>Paul Eugene Brown (September 7, 1908 – August 5, 1991) was an American football coach and executive in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), the National Football League (NFL), and the American Football League (AFL). Brown was both the co-founder and first coach of the Cleveland Browns, a team named after him, and later co-founded the Cincinnati Bengals. His teams won seven league championships in a professional coaching career spanning 25 seasons.

Brown began his coaching career at Severn School in 1931 before becoming the head football coach at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, where he grew up. His high school teams lost only 10 games in 11 seasons. He was then hired at Ohio State University and coached the school to its first national football championship in 1942. After World War II, he became head coach of the Browns, who won all four AAFC championships before joining the NFL in 1950. Brown coached the Browns to three NFL championships — in 1950, 1954 and 1955 — but was fired in January 1963 amid a power struggle with team owner Art Modell. In 1968, Brown co-founded and was the first coach of the Bengals. He retired from coaching in 1975 but remained the Bengals&#x27; team president until his death in 1991. The Bengals named their home stadium Paul Brown Stadium in his honor. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967.

Brown is credited with a number of American football innovations. He was the first coach to use game film to scout opponents, hire a full-time staff of assistants, and test players on their knowledge of a playbook. He invented the modern face mask, the practice squad and the draw play. He also played a role in breaking professional football&#x27;s color barrier, bringing the first African-Americans to play pro football in the modern era onto his teams. Despite these accomplishments, Brown was not universally liked. He was strict and controlling, which often brought him into conflict with players who wanted a greater say in play-calling. These disputes, combined with Brown&#x27;s failure to consult Modell on major personnel decisions, led to his firing as the Browns&#x27; coach in 1963.

==Early life==

Brown grew up in Massillon, Ohio, where he moved with his family from Norwalk when he was nine years of age. His father, Lester, was a dispatcher for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad. Massillon was a shipping and steel town obsessed with its high school and professional football teams, both called the Tigers. Massillon&#x27;s main rival at both levels was nearby Canton, a bigger and richer city. When the professional teams folded in the 1920s, the rivalry between the high school teams took center stage.

Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although he played football as a child, Brown was undersized for the game at less than 150 pounds and at first focused his athletic energies on the pole vault. Harry Stuhldreher, who went on to be one of Notre Dame&#x27;s legendary Four Horsemen, was then the high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown&#x27;s determination to be a good vaulter despite his small size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took over as the starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win–loss record of 15–3 in Brown&#x27;s junior and senior years as the starter.

Brown graduated in 1925 and enrolled at Ohio State University the following year, hoping to make the Buckeyes team. He never got past the tryout phase. After his freshman year, he transferred to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he followed Weeb Ewbank as the school&#x27;s starting quarterback. Under Coach Chester Pittser, Brown was named to the All-Ohio small-college second team by the Associated Press at the end of 1928. In two seasons at Miami, Brown guided the team to a 14–3 record. He was a member of the Kappa chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon. He married his high school sweetheart Katie Kester the following year. Brown had taken pre-law at Miami and considered studying history on a Rhodes Scholarship, but after college he instead took his first job as a coach. On Stewart&#x27;s recommendation, Severn School, a private prep school in Maryland, hired him in 1930.

==High school coaching career==

===Severn School===

Brown spent two very successful years at Severn. The team was undefeated in his first season and won the Maryland state championship. In 1931, the team&#x27;s win-loss-tie record was 5–2–1. Brown&#x27;s overall record was 12–2–1. After his second year, Massillon&#x27;s head coaching job became available, and Brown took the position.

===Massillon Tigers===

Brown returned to Massillon in 1932, when he was 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown&#x27;s old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6–2 record. Brown&#x27;s strategy was to build up a disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed to sit on the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke&#x27;s Jimmy DeHart and Purdue&#x27;s Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.

In his first season at Massillon, Brown&#x27;s team posted a 5–4–1 record, better than the previous year but far from Brown&#x27;s exacting standards. The Tigers improved again in 1933, ending with an 8–2 record but losing to their chief rivals, the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs. In 1934, Massillon won all of its games until a 21–6 defeat to McKinley in the final game of the season. As the pressure on Brown grew to turn the tables on McKinley, Massillon finally accomplished the feat the following year in an undefeated season, the first of several with Brown at the helm.

By then, Brown had put his system into place: a strict, systematic approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network that drew promising young players from Massillon&#x27;s junior high school football program. He paid no attention to race, and brought several African-American players onto the team at a time when many northern schools excluded them.

In the ensuing five seasons, Massillon lost only one game, a 7–0 defeat at New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1937 after several players came down with the flu. As the Tigers&#x27; prestige grew, Brown in 1936 convinced the school to build a new stadium almost triple the size of the existing 7,000-seat facility. The stadium was finished in 1939, and is now named after Brown. The pinnacle of Brown&#x27;s career at Massillon was a victory in the 1940 season against Toledo&#x27;s Waite High School. The Tigers and Waite both went undefeated in the 1939 season, and both claimed the state championship. The teams decided to settle the score the following year, and Brown&#x27;s team won 28–0. The Massillon 1940 squad is still regarded by historians as one of the best in the history of state high school football. In a pre-season scrimmage, the Massillon Tigers played the Kent State University Golden Flashes, and defeated the older college team 47–0.

During his nine years at Massillon, Brown invented the playbook, a detailed listing of formations and set plays, and tested his players on their knowledge of it. He also originated the practice of sending in plays to his quarterback from the sideline using hand signals. His overall record at the school was 80–8–2, including a 35-game winning streak. Between 1935 and 1940, the team won the state football championship five times and won the High School Football National Championship four times, outscoring opponents by 2,393 points to 168 over that span. After the early losses to Canton, the Tigers beat the Bulldogs six straight times.

Brown&#x27;s legacy in Massillon is still honored to this day: the Tiger teams wear his initials on the front shoulder of their uniforms, and a portrait of Brown is permanently displayed on the scoreboard of Paul Brown Tiger Stadium.

==College and military career==

===Ohio State Buckeyes===

Brown&#x27;s success at Massillon raised his profile in Ohio considerably; people started calling him the &quot;Miracle Man of Massillon.&quot; When Ohio State was looking for a new coach in 1940 – Francis Schmidt left after losing to the rival Michigan Wolverines three times in a row – Brown was a candidate for the job. Ohio State officials were skeptical about the 33-year-old making the transition to college football but were worried that they might lose talented high school recruits loyal to Brown if they did not sign him.

Ohio State offered Brown a $6,500 salary ($ in dollars), about $1,500 above his Massillon pay. He accepted in January 1941 and immediately began to institute his rigorous system. Players were drilled and quizzed, and Brown focused on preparing the freshmen to take starting roles as graduating seniors left. He conditioned his players to emphasize quickness, adopting the 40-yard dash as a measure of speed because that was the distance players needed to run to cover a punt.

Brown&#x27;s first year at Ohio State was a success. The Buckeyes won six of eight games in 1941; the only loss was to Northwestern University and its star quarterback, Otto Graham. The final game of the season was a 20–20 tie with Michigan, which the school&#x27;s supporters saw as a good outcome given that Ohio State was a heavy underdog. The Buckeyes tied for second place in the Western Conference, a grouping of college teams from the Midwestern United States (now known as the Big Ten), and finished 13th in the AP Poll. Brown was fourth in balloting for national Coach of the Year.

Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, threatened to derail the 1942 season, but most college teams played on, adjusting schedules to include military teams composed of players serving in the military. The Buckeyes opened the season by beating a Fort Knox team 59–0, followed by two more wins against Southern California and Indiana University. In the first AP Poll of the season, Ohio State was ranked best in the nation, the first time the school had achieved that mark. The 1942 team was the first composed mainly of players hand-picked by Brown, including Bill Willis, Dante Lavelli and star halfback Les Horvath. In the middle of the season, the Buckeyes lost to the University of Wisconsin after numerous players drank bad water and got sick. That was the team&#x27;s only loss of the season, which culminated with a 21–7 victory over Michigan. The Buckeyes won the Western Conference and claimed their first-ever national title after finishing the season at the top of the AP Poll.

The 1943 season was a disaster for Brown and the Buckeyes. Depleted by the military draft and facing tough competition from teams on Army and Navy bases, Brown was forced to play 17-year-old recruits who had not yet enlisted. Ohio State had affiliated itself with the Army Specialized Training Program, which did not allow its trainees to participate in varsity sports, while schools such as Michigan and Purdue became part of the Navy&#x27;s V-12 training program, which did. The Buckeyes ended with a 3–6 record. In three seasons at Ohio State, Brown amassed an 18–8–1 record.

===Great Lakes Bluejackets===

Brown was classified 1-A in 1944 and commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. He served at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside Chicago as head coach of its Bluejacket football team, which competed against other service teams and college programs. The station was a waypoint for Navy recruits between training and active service in World War II, but its commanders took athletics seriously and saw winning as a morale-booster and a point of personal pride. Brown could have been called up for active duty – Tony Hinkle, his predecessor, was already serving in the Pacific – but the war began to wind down as Brown arrived. Brown had little time to institute his system, and instead adopted Hinkle&#x27;s offensive scheme, borrowed from the Chicago Bears. He had a smattering of talented players, including defensive end George Young and halfback Ara Parseghian. In 1944, the team lost to Ohio State and Notre Dame, but finished with a 9–2–1 record and was among the top 20 teams in the AP Poll.

In September 1944, Arch Ward, the influential sports editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, proposed a new eight-team professional football league called the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) to compete against the more established National Football League (NFL) once the war was over. Ward lined up wealthy owners for the new league, which included teams in Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco and Cleveland. Arthur B. &quot;Mickey&quot; McBride, a taxi-cab magnate who made a fortune in the newspaper business, was the owner of the Cleveland franchise. As Brown was preparing for the 1945 Bluejackets season, Ward came on McBride&#x27;s behalf to ask Brown if he wanted to coach the new team. McBride offered $17,500 a year ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) – more than any coach at any level at the time. McBride also granted Brown full authority over football matters. He also received a stake in the team and a stipend while he was still in the military.

On February 8, 1945, Brown accepted the job, saying he was sad to leave Ohio State, but he &quot;couldn&#x27;t turn down this deal in fairness to my family.&quot; Brown was still Ohio State&#x27;s head coach in absentia, and the decision surprised and outraged school officials who expected him to return after the war. The AAFC did not start play until after the war, however, and Brown continued to get ready for the 1945 season at Great Lakes. That year, many of his best players were transferred to bases on the West Coast as the focus of the war shifted to the Pacific. The team started with a 0–4–1 record, but rattled off six straight wins after the war ended and players returned from service overseas. Within weeks of Brown&#x27;s final Bluejackets game, a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame, he set off for his new job in Cleveland.

==Professional coaching career==

===Cleveland Browns in the AAFC (1946–1949)===

By the time Brown arrived in Cleveland, the team had signed a number of players to its roster, including quarterback Otto Graham, whose Northwestern squad had beaten the Buckeyes in 1941. Many of the players came from Ohio State, Great Lakes and Massillon teams that Brown coached. Lou Groza, a placekicker and tackle, played for Brown at Ohio State before the war intervened. Receiver Dante Lavelli was a sophomore on Ohio State&#x27;s championship-winning team in 1942. Bill Willis, a defensive lineman whom Brown coached at Ohio State, and Marion Motley, a running back who grew up in Canton and played for Brown at Great Lakes, became two of the first black athletes to play professional football when they joined the team in 1946. Other signings included receiver Mac Speedie, center Frank Gatski and back Edgar &quot;Special Delivery&quot; Jones. Brown brought in assistants including Blanton Collier, who had been stationed at Great Lakes and met Brown at Bluejackets practices.

The name of the team was at first left up to Brown, who rejected calls for it to be christened the Browns in his honor. McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945, which yielded the name &quot;Panthers,&quot; which had previously been used by an earlier team that had played in Cleveland in the 1920s. However, the nickname was scrapped soon afterward. Depending on the source, Brown rejected it after learning that the Panthers had failed (according to this version, Brown said, &quot;That old Panthers team failed. I want no part of that name.&quot;), or McBride balked at paying the owner of the original Panthers for the rights to use the name. Whatever the case, in August, McBride gave in to popular demand and christened the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown&#x27;s objections.

For years, however, Brown claimed that the second name-the-team contest yielded the name &quot;Brown Bombers,&quot; after then-world heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis, whose nickname was &quot;The Brown Bomber.&quot; According to this version, when Brown rejected the nickname &quot;Panthers,&quot; he decided that the team needed a nickname befitting a champion, and felt the nickname &quot;Brown Bombers&quot; was appropriate. The name was reportedly shortened to simply &quot;Browns.&quot; This alternate history of the name was even supported by the team as being factual as recently as the mid-1990s, and it continues as an urban legend to this day. However, Paul Brown never held fast to the Joe Louis story, and later in his life admitted that it was false, invented to deflect unwanted attention arising from the team being named after him. The Browns and the NFL now both support the position that the team was indeed named after Paul Brown.

With the roster fixed and the team&#x27;s name chosen, Brown set out to build a dynasty. &quot;I want to be what the New York Yankees are in baseball or Ben Hogan is in golf&quot;, he said.

After a training camp at Bowling Green State University, the Browns played their first game in September 1946 at Cleveland Stadium. A crowd of 60,135 people showed up to see the Browns beat the Miami Seahawks 44–0, then a record attendance mark for professional football. That touched off a string of wins; the team ended the season with a 12–2 record and the top spot in the AAFC&#x27;s western division. The Browns then beat the AAFC&#x27;s New York Yankees in the championship.

Cleveland won the AAFC championship again in 1947 behind an offensive attack that employed the forward pass more frequently and effectively than was typical at the time. The Browns&#x27; offensive success was driven by Brown&#x27;s version of the T formation, which was gradually replacing the single-wing formation as football&#x27;s most popular and effective scheme.

The Browns won every game in the 1948 season, a feat that went unmatched until the Miami Dolphins (coached by Brown disciple Don Shula) did it in 1972. Cleveland then won the AAFC championship for the fourth time in a row in 1949. By then, however, the league was struggling for survival, due in part to the Browns&#x27; dominance. Attendance at games dwindled in 1948 and 1949 as fans lost interest in lopsided victories, and at the end of the 1949 season the AAFC dissolved. Three of its teams, the San Francisco 49ers, the Baltimore Colts and the Browns, merged into the NFL. The Browns picked up a few good former AAFC players from other teams, including offensive guard Abe Gibron and defensive end Len Ford, but some observers saw Brown&#x27;s team as the lone standout in an otherwise minor league.

===Cleveland Browns in the NFL (1950–1955)===

The Browns&#x27; first game in the NFL in 1950 was against the two-time defending champion Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia. They won the game 35–10, the first of 10 victories that year. After beating the New York Giants in a playoff game, the Browns went on to win the championship game against the Los Angeles Rams on a last-minute field goal by Groza. &quot;The flag of the late lamented AAFC flies high, and Paul Brown has the last laugh&quot;, the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot;&#x27;s editorial page proclaimed. Brown said his was &quot;the greatest football team a coach ever had, and there was never a game like this one.&quot; In 16 seasons, Brown had led his teams to 12 championships. He was the first head coach to win both a college and NFL championship, a feat not repeated until Jimmy Johnson and later Barry Switzer did it with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1990s, and Pete Carroll who accomplished the feat with USC in 2004 and the Seattle Seahawks in 2013.

As the Browns climbed to the top of the NFL, speculation began to mount that Brown might return to the Buckeyes. Wes Fesler had resigned as the team&#x27;s coach, and Brown was seen as a possible replacement. But Brown had also alienated many Ohio State alumni by failing to return to the school after World War II and for signing away players including Groza before their college eligibility expired. He interviewed with the university&#x27;s athletic board on January 27, 1951, but the board unanimously rejected Brown in favor of Woody Hayes, who was unanimously endorsed by the board of trustees.

The Browns reached the championship each of the next three years, but lost all of those games. In both 1952 and 1953, Cleveland lost championships to the Detroit Lions, who were then on the rise after decades of mediocrity. Before the 1953 season, McBride sold the team to a group of local businessmen led by David Jones for $600,000 ($ million in dollars). While Brown was upset that McBride did not consult him about the deal, the new owners said they would stay out of the picture and let Brown run the team. Brown saw this as a crucial issue: he felt he needed full control over personnel decisions and coaching to make his system work.

Graham announced in 1953 that the following season would be his last. But the team won the championship in 1954 in a rematch against the Lions, and Brown convinced Graham to come back. Cleveland finished 1955 with a 9–2–1 record, reaching the championship game again. The Browns beat the Rams for their second straight championship, and Graham retired after the season.

===Later years in Cleveland (1956–1963)===

With Graham gone and the quarterback situation in flux, the Browns ended 1956 with a 5–7 record, Paul Brown&#x27;s first losing season as a professional coach. In the next year&#x27;s draft, the team selected Jim Brown out of Syracuse University. As television began to help football leapfrog baseball as America&#x27;s most popular sport, Jim Brown became a larger-than-life personality. He was handsome and charismatic in private and dominant on the field. Paul Brown, however, was critical of some aspects of Jim Brown&#x27;s game, including his disinclination to block. In Jim Brown&#x27;s first season, the team reached the championship game, again against the Lions, but lost 59–14. The Browns did not contend for the championship in the following two years, when a Baltimore Colts team coached by Brown&#x27;s former protégé Weeb Ewbank won a pair of titles.

As Jim Brown&#x27;s star rose, players began to question Paul Brown&#x27;s leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism came to a head in a game against the Giants at the end of the 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank&#x27;s Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York&#x27;s 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he got up to throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal, defeated the Browns 10–0 in a playoff for the Eastern Conference title and reached the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.

Paul Brown blamed the struggles on quarterback Milt Plum, whom the team had drafted in 1957, saying the Browns had &quot;lost faith in Plum&#x27;s ability to play under stress.&quot; In truth, the players were instead losing faith in Paul Brown and his autocratic coaching style. Jim Brown started a weekly radio show, which Paul Brown did not like; it undercut his control over the team and its message. But the coach found it hard to question Jim Brown given his feats on the field, and the tension between the two men grew. The team finished second in its division in 1959 and 1960, even as Jim Brown racked up league-leading seasons in rushing.

Art Modell, a New York advertising executive, bought the team in 1961 for $4.1 million ($ million today). Modell, who was 35 years old at the time, bought out Brown&#x27;s 15% stake in the team for $500,000 and gave Brown a new eight-year contract. He said he and Brown would have a &quot;working partnership&quot;. To Brown&#x27;s chagrin, Modell took a very active role in team operations. In contrast, McBride and Jones had given Brown a free hand in football matters. Modell, who was single and only a few years older than most players, started to listen to their concerns about the coach. He became particularly close to Jim Brown, calling him &quot;my senior partner&quot;. Modell sat in the press box during games and could be overheard second-guessing Paul Brown&#x27;s play-calling, which drove a deeper wedge between the two men. At that time, Brown was the only coach who insisted on calling every offensive play, making use of rotating guards to ferry coaching instructions. Quarterback audibles to change the play at the line of scrimmage in response to defensive positioning were not permitted. When Plum openly questioned Paul Brown&#x27;s absolute control over play-calling, he was traded to Detroit.

The conflict between Brown and Modell reached a breaking point when Brown traded star halfback Bobby Mitchell for the rights to Ernie Davis, a Heisman Trophy-winning running back who broke all of Jim Brown&#x27;s rushing records at Syracuse. Paul Brown did not inform Modell of the move, and Modell only heard about it after getting a call from Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall. Davis, however, was diagnosed with leukemia before the 1962 season. He came to Cleveland to train after the cancer went into remission, but Brown would not allow him to play. Modell, however, wanted to give Davis a chance to play before he succumbed to the disease. Ultimately, the relationship between coach and owner was never repaired, and Ernie Davis never played in a professional game, dying on May 18, 1963.

===Departure from Cleveland===

As the rift between the players and Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A controversy developed over the timing of the decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players&#x27; views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown&#x27;s longtime assistant, was named the team&#x27;s new head coach. Brown remained with the team as vice president and continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract, though the position had no true power in what he told &quot;The New York Times&quot; was a &quot;vice president in charge of I-don&#x27;t-know-what.&quot;

Brown reportedly wished to purchase the Eagles, who were put on sale by the Happy Hundred on April 19, and he led a group of investors that offered $4.5 million. Modell supported his effort regardless of their dispute, telling the Associated Press that he would &quot;not stand in [Brown&#x27;s] way if he wants to buy the Eagles.&quot; Despite his success in Cleveland, the news drew mixed reaction from Philadelphians as opponents saw little reason to replace the current front office or were hesitant to see an &quot;outsider&quot; owning their team. By May, however, Brown had lost interest in the bid, and an article from &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; claimed it &quot;remains doubtful whether Brown ever seriously considered purchasing the Eagles&quot; and that &quot;no attempt was made to put together a group and he hasn&#x27;t visited Philadelphia since the Browns took a licking there last fall.&quot;

Out of football for the first time since 1930, Brown spent the next five years away from the sidelines, never once attending a Browns contest. As the team&#x27;s vice president, he spoke little to Modell, only briefly doing so in 1963 to discuss scouting; Modell explained in 1964 that he did not order Brown to carry out any major responsibilities as it &quot;would have been ludicrous to give a man of his stature piddling assignments.&quot; While he was secure financially, Brown&#x27;s frustration grew with each passing year. &quot;It was terrible&quot;, he later recalled. &quot;I had everything a man could want: leisure, enough money, a wonderful family. Yet with all that, I was eating my heart out.&quot; Because Brown was still receiving his annual salary and liked to play golf, it was said that the only two people who made more money playing golf were Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.

Brown explored coaching possibilities, but he was mindful not to put himself in a position where his control might be challenged as it had been in Cleveland. In 1963, the Titans of New York of the American Football League (AFL) offered him the head coach job for $50,000 but failed.

===Cincinnati Bengals===

Four years later, the AFL, which had formed to compete against the NFL and had recently reached a deal to merge into the older league, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown joined the ownership group. While he had the third-largest stake in the team, he was the public face of the ownership group. He became general manager and head coach, with complete control over the football side of the operation. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for him.

Brown called his new franchise the Bengals because Cincinnati had a team of that name in the 1930s and he thought it would provide a link to the past. Brown&#x27;s son Mike joined the front office and became his father&#x27;s top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.

The Bengals entered the NFL in 1970 as a result of the AFL–NFL merger and were placed in the newly formed American Football Conference alongside the Browns. A career-ending injury to Cook before the 1970 season forced the Bengals to rely on Virgil Carter, an emergency backup who could make accurate short passes but could not throw the ball deep like Cook once could. Brown and Walsh went to work designing an offense around Carter&#x27;s limitations, a scheme that was the genesis of the West Coast offense Walsh later used to great effect when he became coach of the San Francisco 49ers.

The Bengals lost their first meeting with the Browns 30–27 in 1970, and Brown was booed when he did not come on the field to shake Collier&#x27;s hand after the game. &quot;I haven&#x27;t shaken the other coach&#x27;s hands after a game for years&quot;, Brown explained. &quot;... I went up to him before the game, and we did our socializing then.&quot; The Bengals beat the Browns later in the season. Brown called it &quot;my greatest victory.&quot;

As the Bengals&#x27; head coach, Brown took the team to the playoffs three times including 1970. Despite finding a franchise quarterback in Ken Anderson, Brown&#x27;s team never got past the first round of the postseason tournament. Four days after the Bengals were eliminated from the playoffs in 1975, Brown announced he was retiring after 45 years of coaching. The game had changed dramatically during his time in the NFL, growing from America&#x27;s second sport to the country&#x27;s biggest and most lucrative pastime. Brown was 67 years old.

==Later life and death==

Bill Walsh was passed over in favor of Bill &quot;Tiger&quot; Johnson for the head coaching job when Brown retired. In a 2006 interview, Walsh said Brown worked against his candidacy to be a head coach anywhere in the league. &quot;All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them&quot;, Walsh said. &quot;And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep me out of the NFL.&quot; Brown stayed on as team president after stepping down as head coach, and the Bengals later made two trips to the Super Bowl, losing both games to Walsh and the 49ers. He rarely appeared in public, however. He died on August 5, 1991, at home from complications of
pneumonia.

Brown and Katie had three sons: Robin, Mike and Pete. Following Katie&#x27;s death of a heart attack in 1969, he married his former secretary Mary Rightsell in 1973. His son Robin died of cancer in 1978. Brown is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Massillon.
Brown was succeeded by his son Mike as Bengals&#x27; team president. Subsequently, in 2000, Cincinnati opened a new football facility on the Ohio River, naming it Paul Brown Stadium, a name it would keep until 2022. Brown was inducted in 1967 to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. &quot;I feel he&#x27;s as fine a coach as the game ever has had&quot;, Otto Graham said at the induction ceremony. &quot;I used to cuss him out and complain but now I&#x27;m happy that I played under him.&quot; In 2009, &quot;Sporting News&quot; named Brown as the 12th greatest coach of all time; only two other NFL coaches were listed above him.

==Legacy==

Although Brown coached dozens of successful teams at the high school, college and professional levels, his controlling personality and sharp criticisms made him unpopular with many players. Brown was a methodical and disciplined coach who tolerated no deviation from his system. His professional teams&#x27; planes did not wait for players who were late; anyone who missed the flight was forced to find one on his own and pay a fine to Brown. When the Browns practiced twice in a day in training camp, each session was exactly 55 minutes. Regular practices during the season lasted an hour and 12 minutes. Players who made mistakes in games were held up for ridicule during film review sessions. &quot;There got to be a saying&quot;, longtime Browns safety Ken Konz said years later. &quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s a right way, a wrong way and the Paul Brown way.&#x27; If you did it the Paul Brown way, you were right. He was a very strict coach, and he expected you to toe the line.&quot;

Brown was also a tough negotiator over salaries, often refusing to give players raises despite strong performance. He was called &quot;cold and brutal&quot; by sportswriters, and told players to be &quot;ready to fight for your financial lives&quot;. &quot;When I signed with Paul, he felt that $1,000 was $10 million&quot;, said Gene Hickerson, a guard who played for the Browns in the late 1950s and 1960s. Brown&#x27;s stingy approach to salaries frustrated his players and was a motivating force behind the formation of the National Football League Players Association, which represents players&#x27; interests in dealings with the league. Browns players including Dante Lavelli and Abe Gibron helped found the union in 1956 along with lawyer and former Browns assistant coach Creighton Miller. Brown was so annoyed by the union that he had a 1946 team photo in his office touched up to remove Miller.

Brown&#x27;s acrimonious departure from Cleveland was another source of criticism. His teams&#x27; winning ways had helped obscure his harsh methods and need for control, but Modell&#x27;s active involvement in the team exposed them. Despite that Modell owned the team, Brown refused to cede any authority or be diplomatic in his relationship with Modell. Modell felt Brown was unwilling to adapt to the way football was played in the early 1960s. Many players from that time agreed. &quot;Paul didn&#x27;t adjust to the changes in the game&quot;, former Browns cornerback Bernie Parrish said in 1997. &quot;By 1962, he was more worried about protecting his reputation as the Greatest Coach Who Ever Lived than he was about winning a title. ... By the end of the 1962 season, a lot of us wanted to be traded because we were convinced that we&#x27;d never win a title with Paul Brown – and we never believed Paul Brown was going anywhere.&quot; After his firing, Brown held a grudge against Modell for the rest of his life. He never forgave Collier for taking over as coach when he left, even though Collier had asked for and received his blessing.

Although he was criticized for his autocratic coaching style and strained relationships, Brown played a significant role in the evolution and modernization of football. The draw play he invented – a formation in which the quarterback drops back to pass but then hands off the ball to a running back – is still in wide use. In his autobiography, Brown said the play came about by accident in 1946 when Graham botched a play and improvised by making a late handoff to Marion Motley, who ran past the onrushing defenders for a large gain. He developed detailed passing patterns that were designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the defense. Brown is also credited with the creation of the passer&#x27;s pocket, an offensive line protection scheme that is designed to buy a quarterback a few extra seconds to find the open receiver.

Brown&#x27;s main contribution to the game, however, was not to the development of new plays but to the organization and administration of teams. Before Brown, football was seen as a chaotic affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy and preparation seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get an edge on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns&#x27; college draft.

The success of this systematic approach forced other teams to follow. Most of Brown&#x27;s organizational innovations are still in use today. &quot;No one, I mean no one, has ever had total command and respect like Paul Brown&quot;, Paul Wiggin, a former Browns defensive end, said in 1997. &quot;I believe that Paul Brown could have been a general in the Army ... you put Paul Brown in charge of anything and he would have been one of those special people who could organize and lead.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s approach influenced future generations of coaches down to the present day. Men he worked directly with, including Don Shula, Weeb Ewbank, Chuck Noll and Bill Walsh, all adopted his system to some degree.

While Brown&#x27;s tenure in Cleveland ended in bitterness, the coach was a prolific innovator with the team. One factor in Brown&#x27;s success was his decision to hire a full-time staff of dedicated position coaches, a break from the norm in an era when most assistants took second jobs in the offseason to make ends meet. Brown also invented the practice squad, known in that era as the taxi squad, a group of promising players who did not make the roster but were kept on reserve. Team owner Mickey McBride put them on the payroll of his taxi company, although they did not drive cabs.

Brown sat his players down in classrooms and relentlessly tested them on their knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public, and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season. According to Pat Summerall, Brown once traded a player, future Hall-of-Famer Doug Atkins, for burping out loud during a team meeting.

He was the first coach to use intelligence tests to evaluate players, scout opponents using game films and call plays for his quarterback using guards as messengers. He invented the draw play and helped develop the modern face mask after Len Ford and Otto Graham suffered facial injuries. Although critical of Brown&#x27;s coaching, Jim Brown said he integrated football in the right way:

Paul Brown integrated pro football without uttering a single word about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That&#x27;s how you do it. You don&#x27;t talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But this was a time in sports when you&#x27;d play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.

The Bengals stadium was named in his honor until 2022. He was a member of the Bengals&#x27; inaugural Ring of Honor class in 2021.
