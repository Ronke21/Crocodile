<text>The Piscataqua River (Abenaki: &quot;Pskehtekwis&quot;) is a tidal river forming the boundary of the U.S. states of New Hampshire and Maine from its origin at the confluence of the Salmon Falls River and Cochecho River to the Atlantic Ocean. The drainage basin of the river is approximately , including the subwatersheds of the Great Works River and the five rivers flowing into Great Bay: the Bellamy, Oyster, Lamprey, Squamscott, and Winnicut.

The river runs southeastward, with New Hampshire to the south and west and Maine to the north and east, and empties into the Gulf of Maine east of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The last before the sea are known as Portsmouth Harbor and have a tidal current of around . The cities/towns of Portsmouth, New Castle, Newington, Kittery and Eliot have developed around the harbor.

== History ==

Named by the area&#x27;s original Abenaki inhabitants, the word &quot;Piscataqua&quot; is believed to be a combination of &quot;peske&quot; (branch) with &quot;tegwe&quot; (a river with a strong current, possibly tidal). The first known European to explore the river was Martin Pring in 1603. Captain John Smith placed a spelling similar to &quot;Piscataqua&quot; for the region on his map of 1614. The river was the site of the first sawmill in the colonies in 1623, the same year the contemporary spelling &quot;Piscataqua&quot; was first recorded.

Once salmon, sturgeon, oysters, clams, scallops, lobsters, mussels, eels, seals, and many others species of marine life were common in the river, evidenced by such tributaries as the Salmon Falls River, Sturgeon Creek and Seal Rock in Eliot, Maine, the Oyster River in Durham, New Hampshire, and the Lamprey River in Newmarket, New Hampshire. All but the salmon and sturgeon remain, with fishing for striped bass and bluefish common recreational sports.

In the mid 1630s some of the region&#x27;s earliest European settlers built a sawmill in what is today&#x27;s Berwick, Maine, on a tributary above the head of tide of the Piscataqua. Thought to be the first over-shot water-powered site in America, it became known as the &quot;Great Works&quot;, giving name to today&#x27;s Great Works River.

After the Allies&#x27; European victory in the Second World War, four surrendered German U-boats traveled upriver to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, with their captains and crews interned as POWs at Portsmouth Naval Prison. U-805 was the first to arrive, towed up the river to a rendezvous with U.S. officials on a tugboat off the Navy Yard on May 15, 1945. U-873 and U-1228 arrived the next day.

U-234, by far the greatest prize, arrived on May 19, seized off Nova Scotia by the U.S. destroyer escort . It had left Germany with a cargo bound for Japan of a disassembled Messerschmitt Me 262 jet plane, the most sophisticated fighter of World War II; two top Japanese scientists; and two high-ranking Nazi officers. While this was enough to create a media sensation, it was decades later before the U.S. government revealed that the sub also carried a top secret load of uranium oxide produced by the German atomic weapons program bound for a last-ditch Japanese effort. Instead, the extremely valuable nuclear material was diverted to the U.S.&#x27; top secret Manhattan Project, and ended up part of the bomb the U.S. Army Air Corps dropped over Hiroshima to hasten the end of the Pacific war.

The shipyard is located on Seavey&#x27;s Island in Kittery, Maine near the Piscataqua&#x27;s mouth. Long regarded by some as being in New Hampshire, the yard was claimed by that state into the 2000s. However, the Piscataqua River border dispute over Seavey&#x27;s Island was settled by a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision which cited a 1977 decision affirming New Hampshire&#x27;s claim that the state borders met at the center of the river&#x27;s navigable channel as described in a 1740 decree, thus placing the island in Maine.

==Estuary==
The Piscataqua River and its tributaries, including Great Bay, form a substantial estuarine environment. Two rivers, the Salmon Falls and Cochecho, join to form the Piscataqua on the eastern edge of Dover, New Hampshire, at the northwest corner of Eliot, Maine. Five rivers with tidal stretches flow into Great Bay: the Bellamy, Oyster, Lamprey, Squamscott, and Winnicut, and the Great Works River drains into the tidal portion of the Salmon Falls.

<text>Biéville-Beuville () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. The hyphenated name originates from the former communes of &quot;Biéville-sur-Orne&quot; and &quot;Beuville&quot;, which were united in 1972.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Biéville&quot; is believed to come from the Old German name &quot;Boio&quot; or &quot;Boia&quot; combined with the Old French &quot;ville&quot;, meaning farm. Biéville was recorded as &quot;Boiavilla&quot; in 1082. Residents (of the combined town) are still known as &quot;Boevillais&quot;.

Similarly, &quot;Beuville&quot; is believed to come from the Old German name &quot;Bodo&quot;. It was recorded as &quot;Bodvilla&quot; in 1134.

Norman settlers from the area in Scotland and England carried surnames such as &quot;de Bouvelles&quot;, &quot;de Bovelles&quot;, &quot;de Boyuille&quot; and &quot;de Boyuill&quot;, and are believed to be the origin of the common surnames Boyle and Bowles.

==History==
Until the middle of the 16th century, the seignory of Beuville remained in the hands of the de Beuville family. In 1770, it fell to the Lecocq family; Louis Lecocq was the last lord of Beuville before the French Revolution overthrew the nobility.

The lordship of Bieville was a &quot;fiefferme&quot; (a fiefdom owned by the crown but leased to a local lord). The lords of Biéville were less powerful than the lords of other seignories such as Beuville, as their lands were not centralized. The lords of Biéville operated several other significant estates, including Rubercy, la Vallée, Balleroy, and la Londe.

During the Second World War, the British fought the Germans for more than a month nearby. The two parishes were united to form one commune in 1972.

==Population==
The population data before 1972 refer to the sum of the populations of the former communes Beuville and Biéville-sur-Orne.

==Geography==
Blainville-sur-Orne is on the west side of the Canal de Caen à la Mer, just south of Bénouville and the famous Pegasus Bridge of D-Day fame. The town is also home to a Renault Trucks (formerly Saviem) manufacturing plant. The plant is across the canal to the southeast, between the canal and the Orne River. Just across the river from the plant is the commune of Colombelles. Directly across the canal from Blainville-sur-Orne is the fourth commercial French port for the importation of exotic wood, generally coming from the Gulf of Guinea. The port also exports cereals that are produced in the area and has a silo capacity of 33,000 tons. It lies north of Caen and south of the English Channel.

<text>The Salmon Falls River is a tributary of the Piscataqua River in the U.S. states of Maine and New Hampshire. It rises at Great East Lake, Newichawannock Canal, and Horn Pond and flows south-southeast for approximately , forming the border between York County, Maine, and Strafford County, New Hampshire.

The Salmon Falls River joins the Cochecho River near Dover, New Hampshire, to form the Piscataqua River.

It provides hydroelectric power at the New Hampshire towns of Milton, North Rochester, East Rochester, New Hampshire, Somersworth, and Rollinsford, and in Maine at Berwick and South Berwick. The final three miles of the river, from South Berwick to the Piscataqua, are tidal.

Local Abenaki Indians called the river &quot;Newichawannock&quot; (New-ik-a-WAN-nok), meaning &quot;river with many falls&quot;. See Newichawannock Canal

<text>Joe Henry Engle (August 26, 1932 – July 10, 2024) was an American pilot, aeronautical engineer, and NASA astronaut. He was the commander of two Space Shuttle missions including STS-2 in 1981, the program&#x27;s second orbital flight. He also flew two flights in the Shuttle program&#x27;s 1977 Approach and Landing Tests. Engle was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the Air Force and NASA.

As an X-15 pilot, Engle made three flights above , thus qualifying for astronaut wings under the American convention for the boundary of space. In 1966, he was selected for NASA&#x27;s 5th Astronaut Group, joining the Apollo program. He was backup Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) for Apollo 14 and was originally scheduled to walk on the Moon as LMP for Apollo 17. However, cancellation of later flights prompted NASA to select geologist-astronaut Harrison Schmitt as the Lunar Module Pilot, displacing Engle.

==Biography==

===Personal life and education===
Engle was born on August 26, 1932, in Abilene, Kansas. He was raised in Chapman, Kansas, where he attended primary and secondary school. Engle graduated from Dickinson County High School in 1950. He was active as a Boy Scout and earned the rank of First Class. Engle received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Kansas in 1955, where he was a member of the Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity.

Engle was married to the former Mary Catherine Lawrence (1934–2004) of Mission Hills, Kansas, and had two children and one stepchild. After her death, he married Jeanie Carter of Houston, Texas. Engle&#x27;s recreational interests included flying (including World War II fighter aircraft), big game hunting, backpacking, and athletics. He was a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and became a Fellow in 2009. 

Engle died at his home in Houston, Texas on July 10, 2024, at the age of 91. With Engle&#x27;s death, all 12 pilots to fly the X-15 are now deceased.

===Flight experience===

Engle received his commission in the U.S. Air Force through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps at the University of Kansas. While in school he was a member of the Professional Engineering Fraternity Theta Tau, and decided to become a test pilot. While working at Cessna Aircraft during the summer, he learned how to fly from a fellow draftsman, Henry Dittmer.

Engle entered flying school in 1957, and received his pilot wings in 1958. He flew the F-100 Super Sabre with the 474th Fighter Day Squadron and the 309th Tactical Fighter Squadron at George Air Force Base, California. Chuck Yeager recommended Engle for Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School, from which he graduated in 1961, and he was later assigned to the third class of the Aerospace Research Pilot School, despite his reluctance to leave &quot;stick and rudder&quot; flying for a space capsule.

After serving as a test pilot in the Fighter Test Group at Edwards Air Force Base, California, Engle was a test pilot in the X-15 research program at Edwards from June 1963 until his assignment to the Manned Spacecraft Center (now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center). Engle had applied with fellow ARPS student Charles Bassett and Michael Collins to the third NASA astronaut group, but the Air Force withdrew Engle&#x27;s NASA application and instead chose him to replace Robert M. White in the X-15 program, which pleased Engle.

Engle&#x27;s parents witnessed his X-15 flight of June 29, 1965, which exceeded an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) and qualified him for astronaut wings; he again exceeded 50 miles twice during his career of 16 flights. On his final X-15 mission, free flight 153 (1-61-101), which took place on October 14, 1965, he became the first of only two pilots to accomplish a sub-orbital space flight in an X-15 without the benefit of the assistance provided by the MH-96 adaptive flight control system. Despite what he later called &quot;the best flying job in the world&quot;, Engle decided to apply again to NASA as he expected to be rotated to another Air Force assignment within a year and hoped to go to the Moon.

Engle flew over 185 different types of aircraft (25 different fighters) during his career, logging more than 15,400 hours flight time of which 9,000 were in jet aircraft.

===NASA career===
Engle was one of 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He served on the support crew for Apollo 10. He then served as backup Lunar Module Pilot for the Apollo 14 mission. He was due to land on the Moon as Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 17, but was replaced by geologist Harrison Schmitt. This was a result of pressure from the scientific community to have a professional geologist explore the Moon, and not just test pilot engineers who had been given rudimentary geology training. In response to getting bumped from the mission, he said &quot;When you think about it, the lunar missions were geology-oriented.&quot;

According to Engle, Deke Slayton asked him whether he would prefer to fly on Skylab, Apollo–Soyuz, or the Space Shuttle; Engle responded that he would prefer the Shuttle as it was an airplane.

Engle was commander of one of the two crews that flew the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Test Flights from June through October 1977. The Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; was carried to 25,000 feet on top of the Boeing 747 carrier aircraft, and then released for its two-minute glide flight to landing. In this series of flight tests, Engle evaluated the Orbiter handling qualities and landing characteristics, and obtained the stability and control, and performance data in the subsonic flight envelope for the Space Shuttle. He was the backup commander for STS-1, the first orbital test flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. Together with pilot Richard Truly he flew as commander on the second flight of the Space Shuttle, STS-2, becoming the last NASA rookie to command a spaceflight until Raja Chari in 2021 on SpaceX Crew-3. He was also mission commander on STS-51-I and logged over 225 hours in space.

Engle was one of two people to have flown into space on two different types of winged vehicles: the X-15 and the Space Shuttle, on STS-2 (the other person being Frederick W. Sturckow). Engle manually flew large numbers of flight-test maneuvers on the Shuttle during reentry and landing; periods of manually flown test maneuvers were interspersed with periods of computer control.

He served as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight at NASA Headquarters from March to December 1982. He retained his astronaut flight status and returned to Johnson Space Center in January 1983. He also participated in the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster investigation in 1986, and did other consulting work on the Shuttle well into the 1990s.

=== Post-NASA career ===
Engle retired from the USAF with the rank of colonel on November 14, 1986, and from NASA on November 28, 1986. On December 1, 1986, he was appointed by the Governor of Kansas and the United States Secretary of the Air Force to a billet in the Kansas Air National Guard at the rank of brigadier general, initially serving as a special assistant to the adjutant general. Under this arrangement, Engle was permitted to retain Houston residency. The discrepancy between his Air Force and Air National Guard ranks was rectified by Senate confirmation of his promotion on February 2, 1988. He subsequently served as Air National Guard assistant to the commander in chief, United States Space Command and North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), with headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. Engle ultimately retired from the Air National Guard around 1991 at the rank of major general, a promotion previously confirmed by the Senate on June 22, 1989.

In 1992, he was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor. In 2001, Engle was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame.

<text>Georgia State University (Georgia State, State, or GSU) is a public research university in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Founded in 1913, it is one of the University System of Georgia&#x27;s four research universities. It is also the second largest institution of higher education by enrollment based in Georgia with a student enrollment of around 50,000, including approximately 33,000 undergraduate and graduate students at the main campus downtown.

Georgia State is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;. The university is the most comprehensive public institution in Georgia, offering more than 250-degree programs in over 100 fields of study spread across 10 academic colleges and schools. Georgia State has two libraries: University Library, which is split between Library North and Library South on the main campus and also divided among the Perimeter College campuses, and Law Library, which is located on the main campus. Together, both libraries contain over 13 million holdings and serve as federal document depositories. Georgia State has a $2.5 billion economic impact in Georgia.

Georgia State University&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics teams, the Georgia State Panthers, compete in NCAA Division I&#x27;s Sun Belt Conference. Georgia State is a founding member of the Sun Belt Conference.

==History==
Initially intended as a night school, Georgia State University was established in 1913 as the Georgia School of Technology&#x27;s Evening School of Commerce. A reorganization of the University System of Georgia in the 1930s led to the school becoming the Atlanta Extension Center of the University System of Georgia and allowed night students to earn degrees from several colleges in the University System. During this time, the school was divided into two divisions: Georgia Evening College and Atlanta Junior College. In September 1947, the school became affiliated with the University of Georgia and was named the Atlanta Division of the University of Georgia.

For its first four decades, the school was treated as an offsite department of its parent institution, Georgia Tech, until 1947, and UGA after 1947. Accordingly, its chief executive was called a director. However, in 1955, the Board of Regents made it an autonomous four-year college under the name Georgia State College of Business Administration. Walter Sparks, who had served as director since 1927, became the newly autonomous institution&#x27;s first president. In 1961, other programs at the school had grown large enough that the name was shortened to Georgia State College. It became Georgia State University in 1969.

In 1995, the Georgia Board of Regents accorded Georgia State &quot;research university&quot; status, joining the University of Georgia, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Augusta University. 
The first African-American student became enrolled at Georgia State in 1962, a year after the integration of the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech. Annette Lucille Hall was a Lithonia social studies teacher who enrolled in the course of the Institute on Americanism and Communism, a course required for all Georgia social studies teachers.

The Peachtree Road Race was founded in 1970 by Georgia State cross-country coach and dean of men Tim Singleton, heading it in its first six years before turning it over to the Atlanta Track Club.

===Expansion periods===

====1913–1975====
Over its 100-plus-year history, Georgia State&#x27;s growth has required the acquisition and construction of more space to suit its needs. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, numerous buildings were constructed as part of a major urban renewal project, such as the Pullen Library in 1966, Classroom South in 1968, the expansion of the Pullen Library in 1968, the Arts and Humanities Building in 1970, the 10-story General Classroom Building in 1971 (now called Langdale Hall), the Sports Arena in 1973, and the 12-story Urban Life Building in 1974. In addition, a raised platform and walkway system was constructed to connect these buildings over Decatur Street and various parking structures.

====1980–1989====
In the 1980s, another round of expansion took place with the acquisition of the former Atlanta Municipal Auditorium in 1979, which was subsequently converted into Alumni Hall in 1982 and then to Dahlberg Hall in 2010, and currently houses Georgia State&#x27;s administrative offices. That same year, the College of Law was founded in the Urban Life Building, and the Title Building on Decatur Street was acquired and converted into the College of Education&#x27;s headquarters and classroom space. In 1988, the nine-story Library South was constructed on the south side of Decatur Street, which was connected to the Pullen Library via a three-story high foot bridge (officially referred to as a &quot;link&quot;) and effectively doubled the library&#x27;s space.

====1990–2004====
Georgia State continued this growth into the 1990s, with the expansion of Alumni Hall in 1991, the opening of the Natural Science Center in 1992, and the acquisition of the former C&amp;S Bank Building on Marietta Street in 1993, which is now the home of the Robinson College of Business. Georgia State&#x27;s first move into the Fairlie-Poplar district was the acquisition and renovation of the Standard Building, the Haas-Howell Building, and the Rialto Theater in 1996. The Standard and Haas-Howell buildings house classrooms, offices, and practice spaces for the School of Music, and the Rialto is home to Georgia State&#x27;s Jazz Studies program and an 833-seat theater. In 1998, the Student Center was expanded toward Gilmer Street and provided a new 400-seat auditorium and space for exhibitions and offices for student clubs. A new Student Recreation Center opened on the corner of Piedmont Avenue and Gilmer Street in 2001. In 2002, the five-story Helen M. Aderhold Learning Center opened on Luckie Street amid controversy over the demolition of historical buildings on its block. Most recently, in 2004, the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies was moved to the former Wachovia Bank Building at Five Points.

====2005–2015====
After the release of the 2006 master plan update, a host of new building activities occurred on campus. A $20 million refurbishment to the Pullen Library complex was completed during the 2006–07 school year. Multiple new units of on-campus housing were built, including the 2,000 bed University Commons in 2007, a new dormitory named Freshman Hall (later renamed Patton Hall) in 2009 and a conversion of a former Wyndham Garden Hotel and a Baymont Inn &amp; Suites into a new 1,100 occupancy dormitory named Piedmont North. New Greek housing was built in 2010 along Edgewood Avenue. The Citizens Trust Building on Piedmont Avenue was purchased by the university to make room for offices and student services in 2007. The Parker H. Petit Science Center was completed in 2010, opening up state-of-the-art science laboratories and teaching space. In 2013, Georgia State started operating from the original home of the Trust Company of Georgia and the SunTrust Bank, the 25 Park Place Building, a 26-floor skyscraper located adjacent to Woodruff Park in the heart of downtown Atlanta. The building currently houses many academic units of the College of Arts and Sciences, including the Dean&#x27;s Office, the University Advisement Center, and facilities of the School of Public Health. In May 2015, the College of Law was moved to its new building at 89 Park Place after the land was donated to the university.

====2016–present====
The newest incarnation of the university&#x27;s strategic plan gives an outline of the university&#x27;s growth from 2011 until 2016 and a brief overview that will be amended for up to 2021. In 2016, an extension to the Petit Science Center was completed. Plans exist for the building of graduate student housing behind the center.

On May 31, 2012, the athletics department released a new facilities master plan. The plan includes upgrades and renovations to the GSU Sports Arena including new outdoor sand volleyball courts (which have since been completed) as well as plans to build new baseball, softball, and soccer stadiums. These would replace the current stadiums in Panthersville. In May 2014, the university announced its intentions to pursue the Turner Field site once the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball club moves into Truist Park in 2017. The university intends to retrofit Turner Field into a 30,000-seat open-air football stadium and build a new baseball field on the site of the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, incorporating the wall where Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run. Additional retail and student housing development is also planned for the parking areas surrounding Turner Field.

On December 21, 2015, the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority announced that Georgia State&#x27;s bid to redevelop Turner Field had been accepted. On August 18, 2016, Georgia State and the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority reached a tentative purchase agreement for Turner Field, and the purchase and redevelopment plan was approved by the Board of Regents on November 9, 2016. On January 5, 2017, Georgia State&#x27;s acquisition of Turner Field, since renamed Georgia State Stadium, was officially closed, with the stadium conversion project beginning in February 2017. Georgia State Stadium hosted its first game on August 31, 2017.

In June 2021, M. Brian Blake became Georgia State University&#x27;s first African-American and person of color president.

In November 2024, Georgia State University secured $107 million to initiate significant upgrades to its downtown campus as part of a transformative plan featuring nine projects aimed at revitalizing and reimagining the campus experience. The effort was bolstered by an $80 million donation from the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, marking the largest gift ever made by the foundation to a University System of Georgia institution.

=====Consolidation with Georgia Perimeter College=====
On January 5, 2015, news broke that Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter College would merge. Over a year later, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved the merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College, a 2-year college with five campuses. The board also announced that the president of Georgia State would remain the president of the combined university, which retained the name Georgia State University. The merger created the largest university in the state of Georgia at about 52,000 students. Since Georgia State&#x27;s consolidation with Georgia Perimeter College in 2016, graduation rates at Perimeter College have almost tripled.

==Campus==

From Georgia State&#x27;s days as a single-building night school into the university it is today, Georgia State has built itself into the heart of urban Downtown Atlanta. Whereas the school&#x27;s nickname—dating from the early 1960s—of &quot;the Concrete Campus&quot; was once a source of mild embarrassment, the name has been embraced by the university community. The university embraced the slogan, &quot;a part of the city, not apart from the city&quot; as its growth into Downtown Atlanta increased. This has led to the widening of sidewalks around the campus, and a focus on Decatur Street as becoming the &quot;Main Street&quot; of the campus.

=== 25 Park Place ===
25 Park Place is a mixed-use classroom and office building that houses several departments at Georgia State University. The building was previously the Trust Company of Georgia Building, and before Georgia State University acquiring the building was the SunTrust Bank Building. The Georgia State University Foundation acquired the building in 2006 for $52 million.

=== Sparks Hall ===
Sparks Hall was the first building designed and built specifically for the school. It was designed by the Atlanta architectural firm of Cooper, Barrett, Skinner, Woodbury, and Cooper. Construction took place between 1952 and 1955 and cost about $2 million. The first classes were held in the building on April 21, 1955. On June 8, 1960, the building was named for George McIntosh Sparks, former president of the college. Currently, the building houses Undergraduate Admissions and the Financial Management Center. It also primarily houses classrooms and computer laboratory space.

After the 1996 Summer Olympics were held in Atlanta, Georgia State acquired its first on-campus dormitories in the 2,000-bed Olympic Village housing complex located at the southeast corner of Centennial Olympic Park Drive (formerly Techwood Drive) and North Avenue that was used to board Olympic athletes during the Games. The Village was later sold to the Georgia Institute of Technology and renamed the North Avenue Apartments.

====University Lofts====
In August 2002, the 450-bed University Lofts opened at the corner of Edgewood Avenue and Courtland Street on the northeast side of campus as housing for undergraduate students and student-athletes, as well as students with families and graduate students. In 2008, the Lofts were converted into multiperson dormitories as well as apartment-style dorms, raising the bed counts to its current number of 550 residents in 231 apartments.

====University Commons====
On August 10, 2007, Georgia State opened the University Commons, a US$165 million complex housing 1,992 students, occupying a city block bounded by Ellis Street, Piedmont Avenue, John Wesley Dobbs Avenue and Jesse Hill Jr. Drive. A GSU economics professor estimated the new dorm could have an economic impact of $10–12 million on downtown Atlanta. The university plans to ultimately accommodate 20% of its enrollment in housing near the downtown campus. With the planned opening of University Commons, it was announced on March 7, 2007, that the Georgia Institute of Technology was acquiring the Olympic Village housing, which is located across North Avenue from the institute. In 2011, the Commons were voted &quot;best overall dorms in the country&quot; by DormSplash.com. This was followed in 2012 by The Fiscal Times rating the Commons as some of the most luxurious dormitories in the country, rated third most &quot;insanely luxurious.&quot;

====Patton Hall====

In the fall of 2009, Georgia State opened a 325-bed residence hall exclusively for freshman students, originally named Freshman Hall. Renamed Patton Hall in 2013 after former Georgia State President Carl Patton, the dorms are located on the corner of Piedmont Avenue and Edgewood Avenue, approximately 0.2 miles from the heart of GSU&#x27;s campus. The facility includes a 24/4.5 dining hall offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a buffet style. The dining hall is open to all Georgia State students, and all residents of Patton Hall are required to have meal plans for the dining hall.

====Greek housing====
During the 2010 academic year, Georgia State opened its Greek Housing facility, located adjacent to Patton Hall on Edgewood Avenue. Each of the nine townhomes in the complex features a chapter room, kitchen, and bedrooms ranging from 9–19 beds.

====Piedmont North====
Most recently, Georgia State acquired two hotels in downtown Atlanta, the Wyndham Garden Hotel and Baymont Inn and Suites on Piedmont Avenue. The hotels and grounds have been renovated and changed into dorms, Piedmont North Buildings A and B, contributing to the university&#x27;s transformation into a more traditional campus. The complex now includes living and study space for approximately 1,100 students, as well as green space, recreational areas, and a brand new dining hall, the Piedmont North Dining Hall.

====Piedmont Central====
On May 14, 2014, the ground was broken on a new, 1,152-bed residence hall named Piedmont Central. The hall received its first residents in fall semester of 2016. The facility includes a 15,000-square-foot dining facility, conference rooms, communal kitchens, study rooms, and laundry facilities.
===Campus security===
The department is composed of more than 160 state-sworn police officers, 60 full-time security guards, 10 part-time security guards, 16 communications dispatchers and eight staff members, making it the largest campus law enforcement agency in Georgia.

===Perimeter College===
Perimeter College consists of five different campuses around the Metro Atlanta region. Campuses in Alpharetta, Clarkston, Decatur, Dunwoody, and Newton County each offer different amenities. The Alpharetta campus consists of two buildings, with students enrolled at that campus having free access to a nearby private gym, as well as access to the other Perimeter campus amenities. The Clarkston campus is a full campus with athletic facilities, (tennis courts, soccer field, gym) and 14 buildings. The Decatur campus includes greenhouses, tennis courts, as well as six academic buildings including a Student Success Center. The Dunwoody campus includes a gym, weight room, soccer field, tennis courts, an observatory, a gazebo, and eight academic buildings. The Newton campus consists of a baseball field, a softball field, a health and recreation center, and two academic buildings.

==Academics==



The President of Georgia State University (currently Dr. M. Brian Blake) is the head administrator and is appointed and overseen by the Georgia Board of Regents.

The university is composed of 11 colleges (although those divisions use &quot;college&quot;, &quot;school&quot;, or &quot;institute&quot;, those titles do not indicate any distinction between them):

===Schools and colleges===
* Andrew Young School of Policy Studies
* Byrdine F. Lewis College of Nursing and Health Professions
* College of the Arts
* College of Arts &amp; Sciences
* College of Education and Human Development
* J. Mack Robinson College of Business
* College of Law
* School of Public Health
* Institute for Biomedical Sciences
* Honors College
* Perimeter College†

† Unlike the other colleges that make up the university, students accepted to Perimeter College only have access to the five suburban campuses associated with that college and not the main campus. A Perimeter College student must apply for acceptance to the main downtown campus for access to bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

==Research and innovation==
GSU is one of four research universities in the University System of Georgia. In 2023, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked GSU the No. 2 most innovative university in the nation. Georgia State University&#x27;s research and development expenditures of over $200 million for the 2018 fiscal year ranked first in the nation among universities without an engineering or medical school. In 2013, Georgia State University was one of six universities in the nation and the only in Georgia to be named a &quot;Next Generation University&quot; by New America for its proven commitment to expanding enrollment, focus on the neediest of students, and the success of its ethnically diverse student body.

===Libraries===

Georgia State houses three university libraries. Additionally, many academic departments provide libraries for their students. The University Library (formerly known as the William Russell Pullen Library), housed in Library North and Library South, contains more than 1.4 million volumes, including 8,000 active serials and nearly 22,000 media materials. The library provides access to numerous electronic periodical and resource indexes (many with full text), more than 14,000 electronic journals, and about 30,000 electronic books. It is also a Federal Document Depository and holds more than 820,000 government documents with electronic access to many additional titles. From December 2015 through February 2016, the University Library received significant media attention for several armed robberies and other crimes against GSU students within the facility.

===SURAgrid===
On August 31, 2006, Georgia State announced that it would be participating in a supercomputing grid with the installation of an IBM P575 Supercomputer in its Network Operations Center. Through an initiative known as SURAGrid, eventually, 24 universities in 15 states throughout the Southeast United States will form the research backbone and at its peak, the network will be able to perform over 10 trillion calculations per second. University of Georgia and Kennesaw State University are also part of the SURAGrid.

===Physics and astronomy===
Physics at Georgia State is split between physics and astronomy. Areas of research range from atomic physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, neurophysics, nuclear physics, and physics education and innovative instruction. The astronomy program uses many observatories, including the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona and the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (or SMARTS) in Chile, and the CHARA array on Mount Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles County, California, Hard Labor Creek Observatory in Rutledge, Georgia, and the Urban Life Observatory, all of which are operated by Georgia State. Astronomy is now also a partner in the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-m telescope.

===Biology===
Biological research at Georgia State is divided into four categories; applied and environmental microbiology (AEM), cellular molecular biology and physiology (CMBP), molecular genetics and biochemistry, and neurobiology and behavior. The AEM program concentrates on the environmental, industrial, and medical aspects of microbiology, including bioremediation, toxicology, genetics, cellular responses, and natural product biosynthesis. Cellular and molecular biology and physiology focuses on the function and regulation of eukaryotic cells and organisms, doing research including signal transduction, cancer immunology, virology, immunology, and diabetes research. The MGB program ranges from lower eukaryotic programmed cell death to viral RNA replication. The neurobiology and behavior program is involved in research focusing on topics such as neurobiology, behavior, hormonal action, developmental neurobiology, and vertebrate sexual plasticity, to name a few.

Georgia State is currently the only university in the United States operating a BSL-4 lab (the highest bio-safety level) at level 4 conditions. These labs are currently used to investigate herpes B virus, hantavirus, and ebola.

===Research centers===
The College of Arts and Science is home to several centers, inst,itutes and areas of focus, under which the departments of chemistry, biology, psychology, and other college-wide departments can collaborate on interdisciplinary subjects.

*The Language Research Center specializes in language research, with bonobos and chimpanzees. Kanzi, a male bonobo raised at the center, has become famous after learning to communicate via lexigram with his researchers.
*The Center for Neuromics promotes the study of the nervous system using informatics and computational approaches.
*The Neuroscience Institute comprises neuroscience faculty in all departments across the College of Arts and Sciences.
*The Center for Research on Atypical Development and Learning was founded in 1998 to stimulate basic and applied research spanning developmental, clinical, and education psychology, neuropsychology, special education, and speech-language pathology.

Likewise, several university-level institutes exist, allowing collaboration between departments throughout the university as a whole.

*The Center for Behavioral Neuroscience is composed of more than 60 researchers from seven other Atlanta institutions, including Emory University and Georgia Tech. The institute was originally established in 1998 by a grant from the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation and expanded in November 1999 to become one of the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Science and Technology Centers.

*&quot;Creative License&quot;, an annual student-edited literature and arts publication from Perimeter College: The magazine is funded by Perimeter College&#x27;s Student Activity Fee and edited under the advisement of the college&#x27;s English faculty.

===Diversity===
Georgia State University has achieved the most ethnically diverse campus in Georgia and one of the most ethnically diverse in the nation. Since the early 2010s, Georgia State has been the nation&#x27;s leading non-profit institution to annually produce the most African Americans with bachelor&#x27;s degrees. As of 2020, Asians and Hispanics are the fastest growing demographics on campus.

===Student facilities===

====Student Recreation Center====
The on-campus Recreation Center features racquetball courts, a squash court, a 7,000-square-foot free-weight area, an aquatic center, a 35-foot climbing wall, game rooms, exercise rooms, aerobics, dance, and martial arts studios, and a gymnasium containing four basketball/volleyball courts. The top level includes a running track and omni gym. The aquatic center features a 9-lane lap pool, a &quot;leisure pool&quot; with vortex, a spa, and a sauna. The omni gym is outfitted to allow for different sports, including badminton, basketball, fencing, arena flag football, indoor soccer, and volleyball.

====Indian Creek Lodge====
Land in Indian Creek was purchased by the university in 1938, and in 1974 operation of the swimming pool in the facility was taken over by Recreation Services. Tennis courts, Indian Creek Lodge, and the rest of the 15.5 acres were taken over by Recreation Services in 1991.

====Panthersville====
The university&#x27;s outdoor intramural fields are currently located in Panthersville, a suburb of Atlanta. These facilities include two large lighted fields, a sundeck, restrooms, and parking. New land has been purchased by the university east of the University Commons to make room for new intramural fields.

====Cinefest====
Georgia State University operates Cinefest Film Theater, a student-run movie theater in the school&#x27;s University Center. Cinefest exhibits a wide array of motion pictures including international cinema, art house films, revival house movies, and second-run Hollywood fare. Cinefest also has had numerous classic 35-mm film festivals including the Film Fatale Film Festival, and the Summer Camp Nightmare Festival. These festivals often feature rare prints that cannot be seen anywhere else. It has played host to various special events including screening films for The Atlanta Underground Film Festival, the Atlanta Asian Film Festival, the Atlanta Philosophy Film Festival, and DragonCon. The theatre has 135 seats and is free to all Georgia State students, or $3 before 5 pm and $5 after 5 pm. The theatre was first named Cinefest in 1991, but was known as the Lyceum Film Series.

====Panther Dining====
Three dining halls are at Georgia State, one in Patton Hall, one in Piedmont Central, and another in Piedmont North dorms. In addition to these, food courts are in the University Center and in the Student Center.

===Campus transportation===

====Panther Express====

The university provides shuttles circulating campus following four different routes. The blue route circulates from the parking lots of Turner Field to the heart of campus with stops at Langdale Hall and Sparks Hall, and is active on weekdays from 7:00 am to 2:00 am. The red route circulates between the main campus and the Aderhold Learning Center with stops at the Arts and Humanities buildinnd at the Rialto Center/Aderhold. It is active on weekdays from 7:00 am to 2:00 am. The green route is active from 7:00 am to 2:00 am on weekdays with stops at the Student Center, the University Commons, and Piedmont North. The purple route is active on weekends from 5:00 pm to 12:00 am with stops at the Arts and Humanities building, the Student Center, the University Commons, Piedmont North, and the Rialto Center/Aderhold.

====MARTA====
Atlanta&#x27;s mass transit system, MARTA, provides Georgia State students with access to the system at a reduced rate when bought through the university. Georgia State is served by three MARTA rail stations; the Georgia State Station next to the Petit Science Center on the Blue and Green lines, Five Points Station on the Red, Gold, Blue, and Green lines with accommodations for both the Aderhold Learning Center and main campus, and the Peachtree Center Station on the Red and Gold lines, giving access to the Aderhold Learning Center, the University Commons, and the Piedmont North dormitories.

====Streetcar====
In December 2014, streetcars returned to Atlanta for the first time in 60 years. The Atlanta Streetcar’s current route transverses the campus along Edgewood and Auburn Avenues. It connects the main campus to the Aderhold building and Rialto Center for the Arts in Fairlie-Poplar, as well as the Sweet Auburn Curb Market, the Sweet Auburn Historic District, and popular dining and nightlife establishments along Edgewood Avenue.

====Parking====
The university has numerous parking locations, with restrictions in some to faculty and staff. Parking attendants are only on duty from 6:30 am to 10 pm on weekdays, after which parking permits must be used. Some dormitories have built-in parking such as Piedmont North and the University Commons, but parking in these dorms is restricted to students living in them. The University Lofts allow access to permit holders who are primarily residents of the Lofts, the Greek Housing, and Patton Hall. It also allows access to some nonresident holders, faculty, and staff. The G Deck is reserved for use by Georgia State faculty and staff, although on days in which the Sports Arena is in use, it becomes visitor parking for that game or event. The K and T Decks are available for students using cash or a budget card with a valid student parking permit. The N and S decks are for general parking, while the M Deck is reserved for students with a lottery-won permit.

Georgia State students are allowed access to the Georgia State Stadium parking lots just south of campus at the former site of Turner Field, although access to those lots is limited to weekdays between 7:00 am and 11:00 pm. During the Atlanta Braves&#x27; tenure at Turner Field, those times were further limited on home game days. With the conversion of the Turner Field site from a professional baseball venue to GSU&#x27;s football venue, it is expected that parking restrictions beyond the regular hours will be limited to days of Panthers home games. Due to its distance from the university, shuttle services run from the parking to the main campus.

===Greek life===
Georgia State University is home to 31 fraternities and sororities: seven of the North American Interfraternity Conference (IFC), five of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), seven of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), and 12 multicultural organizations operating as the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC). Georgia State added traditional Greek housing in 2010 to house five sororities and four fraternities.

==Arts==

===Rialto Center===

Georgia State University makes notable contributions to the cultural vitality of the downtown Atlanta community. A prominent cultural stage is the Rialto Center for the Arts, an 833-seat performing arts venue located in the heart of the Fairlie-Poplar district in downtown Atlanta. The venue is home to the Rialto Series, presenting the best of national and international jazz, world music, and dance; School of Music performances; the Atlanta Film Festival, and many others. The School of Music holds concerts featuring faculty, students, and guest performers in the Kopleff Recital Hall throughout the year. In addition, the Art Galleries, based in the Ernest G. Welch School of Art and Design, feature special exhibitions, student and faculty works, and visiting artist collections.

===DAEL===
The Digital Arts and Entertainment Laboratory (DAEL), housed in the Department of Communication, offers equipment and facilities for digital media research and production. The DAEL also holds a media festival featuring different productions and media produced by students.

===Digital Aquarium===
Georgia State hosts a multimedia lab allowing students access to multimedia-editing workstations, professional software, technology training workshops, and equipment that can be checked out. The facility also hosts a pro-level recording studio featuring full soundproofing, a dual-screened Mac Pro, a keyboard, and two microphones, although the area is set up to allow for students to bring their own equipment.

==Athletics and traditions==


===Sports===
The 16 Georgia State varsity athletic teams compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I, with their football program being in FBS. They are founding members of the Sun Belt Conference. Georgia State&#x27;s beach volleyball team, competes in Conference USA. The university has won conference championships in basketball (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), baseball, golf (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), softball, soccer (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), women&#x27;s tennis, and beach volleyball. The beach volleyball team has been ranked among the top ten programs in the country every year since its inception in 2013.

Georgia State began competition in all sports in the Sun Belt Conference in 2013, although it had already played all individual sports in the Sun Belt during the 2012–13 season. This marked a return to the conference that Georgia State had helped found in 1976. Before returning to the Sun Belt Conference, GSU played in the CAA from 2005 to 2013, participating for only one season (2012) as a football school. Before joining the CAA, the Panthers competed in the (then Trans America Athletic Conference, or TAAC) Atlantic Sun Conference, joining in 1983 and leaving for the CAA in 2005.
Georgia State University charges a fee to each student who enrolls at the school. This fee is used for athletic scholarships and other costs associated with competitive athletics. The athletic fee allows students to use their Panther Card (student identification card) for free access to athletic events.

The Panthers&#x27; most historic rivalry is with the Georgia Southern Eagles with basketball being played between the two since 1972. However, rivalries have grown since, including with South Alabama with the two programs starting football within a year of one another and playing each other and having played one another every season since Georgia States football&#x27;s inception except one.

Georgia State University&#x27;s first-ever national championship win was in esports in 2019. The university&#x27;s SMITE: Battleground of the Gods team played against Arizona State University at Dreamhack Atlanta and won with a final score of 2 - 0. The team has since won two additional championships, and participated in a third, becoming the winningest sport in the school&#x27;s history.

The university also boasts several nonvarsity sports, including badminton, rowing, rugby, and wrestling 

===1996 Summer Olympic Games===

Georgia State University was used during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, with the GSU Sports Arena hosting the badminton matches. Georgia State&#x27;s prominent position in downtown Atlanta allowed the city to build some of its venues with adaptive reuse in mind to be used by the university. The first on-campus dormitories at the university, the Village, was constructed as part of the Olympic Village to house athletes. This began the metamorphosis of GSU from a commuter college to a massive urban research institute, as well as one of the largest universities in the United States. Centennial Olympic Stadium, host of the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics, was after the games converted to Turner Field, home of MLB&#x27;s Atlanta Braves. After the Braves moved to SunTrust Park in suburban Cobb County, Turner Field and the surrounding grounds were purchased by Georgia State in January 2017. The university converted the stadium to a football field for the school&#x27;s football team, now called Center Parc Stadium (named Georgia State Stadium until 2020), and is building a new campus baseball stadium on the site of the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, and new classrooms and housing on the lot.

===Marching band===
In 2010, Georgia State University established its first-ever marching band. The marching band began its inaugural season in the fall of 2010. 150 students successfully auditioned for the band. In its first year, the band performed at all home football games, a high school marching band exhibition, and (most notably) during the Georgia State vs. Alabama football game on November 18, 2010, in Tuscaloosa. The band is a drum corps-style unit that focuses on precision musicality and movement. Like most ensembles, the band features a colorguard section, but in a departure from typical marching bands, the traditional auxiliary front sideline percussion section, or pit, has been replaced by a four-piece rock band consisting of a lead guitar, bass guitar, drum set, and keyboard synthesizer.

The Georgia State marching band has received many honors, includecludes performing in 2013 for the Second inauguration of Barack Obama, the 2014 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the 2019 Super Bowl LIII halftime show, and the 2022 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California.

===Coat of arms===
The school&#x27;s coat of arms is registered in the College of Arms in the City of London. The Latin motto means, &quot;Truth is strong and will conquer&quot; (or alternatively, &quot;Truth is valuable and shall overcome&quot;). The panther holds the symbol of education, with the quill in red to symbolize the fire in Atlanta&#x27;s city emblem. The gold coin indicates the university&#x27;s beginnings as a business school. The crown august is a representation of the Stone Mountain granite. The center flame is an eternal flame in honor of the first president, George Sparks, and represents flames of scholarship and the burning of Atlanta.

==Alumni and faculty==

Since its opening, Georgia State has graduated more than 227,000 alumni. Currently, an estimated 100,000 alumni live in the metro Atlanta area.

<text>The Selous Scouts was a special forces unit of the Rhodesian Army that operated during the Rhodesian Bush War from 1973 until the reconstitution of the country as Zimbabwe in 1980. It was mainly responsible for infiltrating the black majority population of Rhodesia and collecting intelligence on insurgents so that they could be attacked by regular elements of the security forces. The unit did this by forming small teams that posed as insurgents and usually included captured insurgents. Over time, the Selous Scouts increasingly attacked insurgents themselves and operated in the countries that neighboured Rhodesia. 

The unit developed a reputation for brutality and was responsible for attacking and killing civilians. The Selous Scouts were also involved in the Rhodesian chemical and biological weapons program and used poisons and biological agents in some of its operations. The methods used by the unit led to the deaths of large numbers of insurgents, but proved counter-productive as they further alienated the black majority population from the white minority Rhodesian government and increased international opposition to the regime.

Following the disbandment of the Selous Scouts after Rhodesia&#x27;s transition to Zimbabwe, many of its members were recruited into the Apartheid-era South African security forces. They contributed to the adoption of the Selous Scouts&#x27; methods by the South African Defence Force and South African Police, and some took part in operations to undermine the government of Zimbabwe.

==Background==

In November 1965 the government of the British colony of Southern Rhodesia issued an illegal Unilateral Declaration of Independence. This government represented the country&#x27;s small white minority and was led by Prime Minister Ian Smith. The black majority of the population had little influence on the government, which sought to continue white racial privileges. At the time of independence the Rhodesian Security Forces were relatively large and well trained and equipped.

Two groups with armed elements emerged as the opposition to the white Rhodesian regime. These were the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), whose military wing was the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), and the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU) and its armed wing the Zimbabwe People’s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). Both groups were initially based in Zambia, and from the late 1960s began dispatching insurgents into Rhodesia who used guerrilla tactics. These attacks initially proved ineffective and the Rhodesian military, which had been bolstered by forces from South Africa, was able to effectively counter them. Rhodesia&#x27;s security situation began to deteriorate from late 1972, when the guerrilla armies began making more effective attacks in the north-east of the country. The collapse of the Portuguese Empire in 1975 that led to the independence of Mozambique led to a further increase to the challenges facing the Rhodesian regime, with the guerrillas using that country as well as Botswana as bases.

A tactic in which security forces pose as &#x27;pseudo&#x27; insurgents to gather intelligence was developed prior to the Rhodesian Bush War, and had also been used by police forces. Pseudo operations involve security force personnel being trained to closely imitate insurgents. Teams of these personnel then enter regions where insurgents are active and portray themselves as insurgents. After establishing credibility, the team collects intelligence on actual insurgents and their sources of support. These tactics can be most necessary in regions where the insurgents have eliminated the government&#x27;s sources of intelligence, as was the case in north-eastern Rhodesia in 1973. In general, &#x27;pseudo&#x27; teams undertake only intelligence collection work, and do not attack insurgents themselves. &#x27;Pseudo&#x27; tactics are generally most effective when the teams include former insurgents who have been &#x27;turned&#x27; to side with the government. The effectiveness of these tactics is partially dependent on their use not becoming known, as this will lead to insurgents improving their security processes. Internationally, there has also been a risk of pseudo units breaking the law. If local civilians learn that the security forces are posing as insurgents and using this as cover to break the law, the tactics can be counter-productive as they will erode support for the government. The British authorities used pseudo tactics during the Malayan Emergency, with this coming to the attention of the Rhodesians who took part in that conflict.

==Unit history==
===Establishment===
The British South Africa Police&#x27;s Special Branch began pseudo operations to collect intelligence in 1966. The Rhodesian Army took part in a joint trial using these tactics with the British South Africa Police and Special Branch that year, but it was not successful for at that stage the black population was largely indifferent to the insurgents and so not able to provide intelligence on them.

The ZANLA began to gain control over north-eastern Rhodesia from 1971, and considerably strengthened its influence over the population in the region over the next year. This led to the networks of informers who had provided information to the Rhodesian Government ceasing to do so, which made it difficult for the security forces to locate and counter the insurgents. In response, Special Branch began to establish pseudo teams in January 1973. The Rhodesian Army also formed two such teams in February; these comprised members of C Squadron 22 (Rhodesian) SAS, black soldiers from the Rhodesian African Rifles and former insurgents. These teams enjoyed success, leading to a decision to expand pseudo operations.

Major Ronald Francis Reid-Daly was selected to command the unit that became the Selous Scouts in November 1973. He was personally selected for this role by Lieutenant General Peter Walls, the head of the Rhodesian Army. An initial group of 25 personnel were selected and trained at Makuti near Lake Kariba. The first troop completed training and began operations in January 1974, followed by two other troops in February and March that year. At this time, the Selous Scouts comprised about 120 personnel and all of its officers were white. Black soldiers were offered bonuses that almost doubled their salary if they agreed to serve with the Selous Scouts.

The unit was named after the British explorer Frederick Selous (1851–1917) and its motto was &quot;pamwe chete&quot;—a Shona phrase meaning &quot;all together&quot;, &quot;together only&quot; or &quot;forward together&quot;. The charter of the Selous Scouts directed them to &quot;the clandestine elimination of terrorism both within and without the country&quot;. The name Selous Scouts had previously been attached to the Rhodesian Armoured Car Regiment of the Federal Army of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

The South African Police&#x27;s Special Branch provided funding for the Selous Scouts. This formed part of the South African Government&#x27;s extensive support for the Rhodesian counterinsurgency effort. Many South African Defence Force personnel served in the Selous Scouts between 1973 and 1979, including during operations in Rhodesia, Mozambique and Zambia. After the South African Government publicly withdrew the South African Police units which had been deployed to Rhodesia in 1975 SADF personnel continued to serve with the Selous Scouts. A witness who testified at the post-Apartheid South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission stated that the Selous Scouts were covertly funded by the South African Police and South African police officers also served in the unit.

===Expansion===
Due to the success of the Selous Scouts, Walls directed in mid-1974 that it be expanded from three to six troops. This process was completed by December 1974, and included 50 former insurgents being added to the unit. A Reconnaissance Troop was formed in the second half of 1976 to conduct scouting operations in Mozambique and Zambia; this unit had a peak strength of twelve men.

As part of the expansion of the Selous Scouts, the Rhodesian Army&#x27;s Tracking Wing and Tracker Combat Unit were merged into it during 1974. The Tracking Wing became the Selous Scouts&#x27; Training Troop. The Selous Scouts continued to deliver training in tracking and trackers for the remainder of the war, with this forming a cover for the unit&#x27;s actual role. The Tracker Combat Unit was made up of white reservists; while these men were not suitable for Selous Scouts operations, they were retained to help provide cover. These changes reduced the effectiveness of the Rhodesian Army&#x27;s tracking capabilities.

The size of the Selous Scouts increased further over time, and eventually reached 1,800 men. Many of these were territorial soldiers who were not permanently attached. The rapid expansion of the Selous Scouts led to a drop in the quality of its personnel, which reduced the effectiveness of pseudo operations. This in turn caused the unit to increasingly undertake offensive operations where it directly attacked insurgents rather than gathered intelligence on them. From 1979 former Selous Scouts became part of a scheme where they were armed by the Rhodesian Army and paid bounties for killing insurgents.

The overlap in roles between the Selous Scouts and the SAS led to friction between the two units. They also competed for personnel, with the demands of the Selous Scouts leading to a decline in the effectiveness of the SAS as well as the Rhodesian Light Infantry and Rhodesian African Rifles.

The decline in the effectiveness and discipline within the Selous Scouts led to concerns from other elements of the Rhodesian Army. Selous Scouts were accused of poaching ivory, and Reid-Daly&#x27;s office was bugged by investigators. He was convicted by a court-martial after publicly confronting Lieutenant General John Hickman, the commander of the Rhodesian Army, over the bugging and left the Army afterwards.

===Disbandment===
Ahead of the multi-racial 1980 Southern Rhodesian general election the Selous Scouts and SAS were involved in preparing plans to annul its results. One of these plans would have involved killing the leadership of the black nationalist parties in Operation Hectic. Another, designated Operation Quartz would have involved attacking the insurgents in the camps where they had been concentrated within Rhodesia ahead of the election. These operations were not attempted.

Following the transition to majority rule and Rhodesia&#x27;s reconstitution as Zimbabwe, Prime Minister Robert Mugabe decided in March 1980 to disband the Selous Scouts by April that year. Mugabe stated that the unit needed to be disbanded as part of reforms to provide Zimbabwe with a &quot;respectable&quot; army. At this time it was expected that many of its white members would leave the military. Walls received a hostile reception from the unit&#x27;s officers and men when he visited its base in March 1980. During this visit members of the Selous Scouts called him a traitor. The Selous Scouts were disbanded without a formal ceremony to mark the occasion in April 1980. The unit had suffered between 30 and 35 fatalities during its existence.

Most of the white members of the Selous Scouts moved to South Africa to join that country&#x27;s security forces alobg with forming a security firm called Security Scouts The 900 black members of the unit were offered other positions within Zimbabwe&#x27;s security forces, and were mainly split across three battalions of the Rhodesian African Rifles. Many of the black former Selous Scouts were murdered following the transition to majority rule.

==Structure==
While an Army unit, the Selous Scouts came under the operational control of Special Branch from its establishment in November 1973. This involved Special Branch controlling where the unit operated and how the intelligence it collected was used. Special Branch also had some influence over the Selous Scouts&#x27; training. In terms of Army hierarchy, the Selous Scouts reported directly to Walls. The unit was under orders from Special Branch to not pass any information directly to the Rhodesian Directorate of Military Intelligence, which contributed to very little of the intelligence it collected being provided to Army units.

The Selous Scouts and other Rhodesian special forces continued to report directly to Walls for military purposes after he became the Commander of Combined Operations (COMOPS) in 1977. The Army headquarters provided administrative and logistical support. As the Selous Scouts increased in size and increasingly undertook offensive operations it became impossible for Special Branch to adequately oversee the unit.

Each troop within the Selous Scouts comprised three sections, each usually with nine to twelve men. The size of sections varied, however, and could be as large as 30 men. Selous Scout teams usually included both black and white personnel, with the men forming close bonds. Until almost the end of the war, all of the officers in the Selous Scouts were white.

==Tactics within Rhodesia==
In line with &#x27;pseudo&#x27; doctrine, the role of the Selous Scout was to infiltrate the black population of Rhodesia and penetrate networks of insurgents. They were to then collect intelligence on the locations of insurgent forces and guide attacks on them. Where possible, Selous Scout teams would remain in place for lengthy periods. Selous Scout teams were also used in a &#x27;hunter killer&#x27; role, in which they followed insurgent supply networks from contested areas within Rhodesia to neighbouring countries and killed any insurgents they located during the process. Selous Scout teams were usually successful in impersonating insurgents, even though their tradecraft was at times poor. The unit was more successful in penetrating ZANLA than ZIPRA, as the latter was better disciplined and had stronger command and control processes.

To prevent the regular army or police from firing at Selous Scout teams while they were operating, authorities would declare &quot;frozen areas&quot;, where all Army and Police units were ordered to temporarily cease all operations in, and withdraw from, without being told the actual rationale. Little information was provided to the Army units on the results of these operations or the intelligence that was collected. &#x27;Freezing&#x27; areas generally proved operationally successful, but there were several occasions in which the security forces inadvertently attacked and killed Selous Scouts.

The Rhodesian military established fireforce teams to exploit the intelligence collected by the Selous Scouts. These initially involved groups of soldiers that were inserted by helicopter, and were later expanded with paratroopers. The Rhodesian Light Infantry often provided the soldiers for fireforce teams.

A key element of the Selous Scouts&#x27; methods was &#x27;turning&#x27; captured insurgents to join the Rhodesian security forces. This was normally attempted shortly after insurgents were captured, with them being both threatened and offered incentives. The captured insurgent was usually approached by a former insurgent. In the resulting conversation, the former insurgent emphasised the hardships insurgents were experiencing and that those who were captured faced the death penalty under the &quot;Law and Order (Maintenance) Act&quot;. This legislation imposed severe penalties for people found to be members of subversive organisations, including the death penalty or long prison terms. The captured insurgent was also offered a lump sum payment as well as a soldier&#x27;s salary if they agreed to fight for the Rhodesian government. If an insurgent agreed to be &#x27;turned&#x27; and passed further vetting, they were assigned to a Selous Scout team and operated in regions in which they would not be recognised. Where possible, their family was housed on a Selous Scouts base. Only a small number of &#x27;turned&#x27; insurgents ever deserted or betrayed the unit. Some of the prisoners captured by the Selous Scouts who refused to be &#x27;turned&#x27; were killed.

One of the tactics used by the Selous Scouts was to violate local customs while posing as insurgents with the goal of reducing support for the actual insurgents. The Selous Scouts also sought to increase the divisions between the ZANLA and ZIPRA by posing as members of one group and then attacking members of the other group. These tactics became publicly known and embarrassed the government.

The Selous Scouts were probably responsible for killing black business owners in rural areas who provided support for the insurgents. These killings were conducted secretly.

Special Branch provided the Selous Scouts with poisoned clothing, food, beverages and medicines that the unit inserted into the guerrilla supply chains. The use of contaminated supplies resulted in the reported deaths of over 800 guerrillas, and the likely death toll probably reached well over 1,000.

The Rhodesian Directorate of Military Intelligence estimated in 1978 that the Selous Scouts were responsible for 68% of insurgent fatalities within Rhodesia. These casualties largely resulted from attacks by Rhodesian Army units on insurgents located by the Selous Scouts. However, the unit&#x27;s ruthless tactics were counter-productive as they contributed to further alienating Rhodesia&#x27;s black population from the government. This formed part of broader flaws in the Rhodesian counter-insurgency strategy, and the historian Jakkie Cilliers has written that &quot;the Selous Scouts were merely the instruments of an overly aggressive and punitive strategy, simply directed at killing as many insurgents as possible and punishing the rural black population to force them to desist from support for the insurgent forces.

The apparent success of the Selous Scouts led to the unit being glamorised. However, the Rhodesian leadership considered the all-white SAS to be more professional and security conscious than the Selous Scouts.

==External operations==
The Selous Scouts were involved in the Rhodesian military&#x27;s attacks on insurgents and their bases in neighbouring countries, often known as external operations (or &#x27;externals&#x27; for short). These operations became frequent from 1976. The unit&#x27;s role in external operations included intelligence collection and directly attacking insurgents. In the intelligence gathering role, the Selous Scouts&#x27; Reconnaissance Troop conducted one or two man long-range reconnaissance patrols to locate or gather information on insurgent bases in Mozambique and Zambia. During direct attacks the Selous Scouts often impersonated soldiers of the country they were operating in.

The Selous Scouts operated in eastern Botswana. This included fighting small actions against insurgents and a raid in which ZAPU leaders were captured in Francistown. The Selous Scouts also used pseudo tactics to collect intelligence in Francistown.

Operation Long John was launched on 25 June 1976, against two guerilla bases located in Mozambique. This operation used &#x27;flying column&#x27; tactics for the first time, which involved six vehicles manned by the Selous Scouts attacking the bases. Large quantities of munitions were destroyed, but few casualties were inflicted.

On August 9, 1976, the Selous Scouts carried out Operation Eland, a raid on a ZANLA and FRELIMO controlled refugee camp at Nyadzonia in Mozambique. The Selous Scouts, who were mostly black and disguised in FRELIMO uniforms, included former Portuguese Army soldiers and a former ZANLA commander. They drove into the camp past FRELIMO guards to the parade ground where many were assembled before the attack commenced. The head of the Selous Scouts, Ronald Francis Reid-Daly, claimed that captured ZANLA documents showed that the people killed in the raid were either trained guerrillas or were undergoing guerrilla instruction and training. Paul L. Moorcraft and Peter McLaughlin wrote in 1982, that &quot;although the camp did contain trained guerrillas and young recruits, many of its inhabitants were old people, women and young children who had fled from Rhodesia as refugees&quot;. They further wrote in 2010, that &quot;although nearly all the personnel in the camp were unarmed, many were trained guerillas or undergoing instruction&quot; and that documents captured from ZANLA, revealed more than 1,028 were killed in the operation. A 1994 Amnesty International publication described the operation as a massacre and stated that the camp at Nyadzonya housed refugees, and that a soldier who participated in the raid later stated: &quot;We were told that Nyadzonia was a camp containing several thousand unarmed refugees who could be recruited to join the guerrillas. It would be easier if we went in and wiped them out while they were unarmed and before they were trained rather than waiting for the possibility of them being trained and sent back armed into Rhodesia&quot;. According to Amnesty International, 1,000 people were killed and the operation was &quot;a gross human rights violation and a war crime&quot;. The South African government was angered by this escalation of the war, and withdrew its military and diplomatic support for the Rhodesian regime. Pressure from South Africa led Prime Minister Smith to accept the principle of black majority rule in Rhodesia in September 1976.

The Selous Scouts unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Joshua Nkomo, the leader of ZIPRA, while he was in Zambia.

While the attacks made outside of Rhodesia by the Selous Scouts were usually militarily successful, they worsened the country&#x27;s political position. This was because they resulted in civilians and members of the armed forces in the neighbouring countries being killed.

==Atrocities and illegal activities==
The Selous Scouts had a reputation for brutality. The unit conducted a number of atrocities against villages that were believed to have collaborated with the guerrillas. Members of the units also poached ivory, smuggled guns and beat and killed civilians. During attacks into Botswana, the Selous Scouts committed arson and abducted civilians. The use of insurgent uniforms and civilian clothing by the Selous Scouts may also have violated the 1907 Hague Convention and the Geneva Conventions which prohibit military personnel from wearing enemy uniforms in most circumstances and require that they clearly distinguish themselves from civilians.

Some of the actions undertaken by the Selous Scouts were illegal under Rhodesian law. Selous Scout teams at times attacked Rhodesian Security Forces units and white farms in attempts to persuade local civilians that they were actually insurgents. Another tactic involved repeatedly calling in air strikes and fireforce attacks on insurgents after they had left a specific kraal leading the insurgents to kill innocent civilians in the kraal because they suspected civilians of informing on their positions; it was intended that this would sow divisions between the insurgents and civilians. The Selous Scouts also labelled insurgents as traitors to the insurgent cause and then publicly killed them leading to &quot;disillusionment and bewilderment&quot; among local civilians; this led to several murder investigations being opened into members of the unit. While these illegal activities provided substantial short-term benefits for the Rhodesian government, over the longer term they became well known among civilians and undermined the rule of law and the government&#x27;s legitimacy.

Robert Mugabe accused the Selous Scouts of killing priests and missionaries. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted in 1979 that while no evidence had been provided to support this claim the Rhodesian Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace believed that an unnamed &quot;rogue unit&quot; of the Rhodesian security forces had been disciplined for killing seven religious figures in 1977. In 1980 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the Selous Scouts had bombed churches.

Atrocities conducted by Selous Scouts operating under the guise of insurgents were often blamed on the insurgents in Rhodesian propaganda publications and broadcasts. These atrocities included mutilating civilians, with photos of the victims being included in Rhodesian propaganda.

The unit was also involved with the Rhodesian chemical and biological weapons program. By 1975 some of the prisoners who were held at the Selous Scouts&#x27; secret detention centre at Mount Darwin were being used by the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) for human testing of chemical and biological weapons. The bodies of these prisoners were dumped in mine shafts. During 1976 members of the Selous Scouts disseminated &quot;V. cholerae&quot; in the Ruya River. The unit also used the material to contaminate the water supply of the town of Cochemane in Mozambique. Deaths from cholera occurred in both areas. The Selous Scouts may also have spread anthrax. According to former CIO Officer Henrik Ellert, an incident where Selous Scouts poisoned a well with unknown substances in an area of heavy rebel activity near Rhodesia&#x27;s border with Mozambique killed 200 civilians.

Historians hold differing views on the extent to which the Selous Scouts committed atrocities. Paul L. Moorcraft and Peter McLaughlin argued in 1982 that the Selous Scouts&#x27; &quot;notoriety for treachery and brutality was only partly deserved, for the bulk of its members were engaged on routine military tasks&quot;. They also stated that as the Selous Scouts came under the direct command of the Commander for Combined Operations, the most senior officers in the Rhodesian security forces were complicit in at least some of the atrocities the unit committed. Theodore L. Gatchel has written that the Selous Scouts were frequently accused of a wide range of crimes, but it is difficult to differentiate their real crimes from false accusations and atrocities committed by the actual insurgents. He noted that the unpopularity of the Rhodesian regime resulting from its colonial and racist policies meant that accusations made against the unit were widely believed. Michael Evans observed in 2007 that the Selous Scouts &quot;became rogue elements, as guilty of illegal activities as the very guerrillas they were fighting&quot; and &quot;significant numbers&quot; of the unit &quot;became implicated in activities that included torture, field executions, political assassination, kidnapping and the use of chemical warfare&quot;. Mpho G. Molomo described the Selous Scouts in 2009 as &quot;a terrorist unit within the Rhodesian security forces&quot;. Piers Brendon wrote in 2010 that &quot;the Selous Scouts committed the worst atrocities&quot; of any Rhodesian unit. Ian Martinez has written that the Selous Scout&#x27;s killings of prisoners and use of chemical and biological weapons were war crimes.

==Legacy==
Following the dissolution of the Selous Scouts in 1980, most of its white soldiers emigrated to South Africa and were integrated into the South African Special Forces and the South African Police&#x27;s special units. This formed part of an effort by the SADF to recruit white veterans of Rhodesian counter-insurgency units that was designated Operation Winter. Reid-Daly was among the Selous Scouts who moved to South Africa, and was appointed the head of Transkei Defence Force (the military of the nominally independent &#x27;bantustan&#x27; of Transkei) in the early 1980s. He recruited other former Selous Scouts to train the force, but was forced to resign in 1987 after Transkei&#x27;s rulers were overthrown by a military officer who had previously been trained by the Selous Scouts.

The former Selous Scouts contributed to the adoption by the South African security forces of the unit&#x27;s ruthless tactics. For instance, former Selous Scouts comprised most of the initial personnel of the South African Koevoet unit, and it used similar tactics. This unit was responsible for many human rights violations. The South African Police&#x27;s Vlakplaas paramilitary hit squad that was established in 1979 was also inspired by the Selous Scouts, as was the Civil Cooperation Bureau that was formed in 1986. Following the end of the Apartheid regime in South Africa some former Selous Scouts joined private military companies.

Reid-Daly&#x27;s memoirs &quot;Selous Scouts: Top Secret War&quot;, which were first published in 1982, have had a strong influence on the historiography of the Rhodesian Bush War. It was among the first such works to be published, and was followed by many books by white veterans of the war. The book has been widely cited, with historians and commentators arguing that it clearly illustrated the tactics used by the Rhodesians. It does not mention any of the atrocities committed by the Selous Scouts. Many other books have since been published about the Selous Scouts. These works often glorify the unit.

In 2018 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that glorification of the Selous Scouts formed part of online nostalgia for Rhodesia and had been taken up by far-right movements that were sympathetic to the white Rhodesian regime. Items branded with the slogan and insignia of the Selous Scouts were available for sale, and a company called the &quot;Selous Armory&quot; was selling a range of apparel glorifying the Rhodesian military. In 2021, the newly established Ranger Regiment in the British Army adopted a cap badge that was similar in appearance to the Selous Scouts&#x27; and may have been based on it. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;numerous officers have raised concerns&quot; over the badge. The British Army stated that the badge was &quot;designed around the peregrine falcon&quot; and not the osprey as used by the Rhodesian badge.

<doc id="503128" wikidata="Q442233" url="?curid=503128" title="Richard H. Truly">
<text>Richard Harrison Truly (November 12, 1937 – February 27, 2024) was an American fighter pilot, engineer and astronaut who served as a vice admiral in the United States Navy and as the eighth administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) from 1989 to 1992. He was the first former astronaut to head the space agency.

After his departure from NASA, he led the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1992 to 1997, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory from 1997 to 2005.

==Early life and education==
Born November 12, 1937, in Fayette, Mississippi, Truly attended segregated schools in Fayette and Meridian, Mississippi. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1959. He was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America, achieving its highest rank of Eagle Scout.

Being a member of the Navy ROTC at Georgia Tech, Truly entered the U.S. Navy, where he was ordered to flight school and was designated a naval aviator on October 7, 1960. His initial tour of duty was in Fighter Squadron 33 (VF-33) where he flew F-8 Crusaders aboard USS &quot;Intrepid&quot; and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. He made more than 300 carrier landings.

From 1963 to 1965, Truly was first a student and later an instructor at the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

==NASA career==
In 1965, Truly was among the first military astronauts selected to the United States Air Force&#x27;s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program in Los Angeles, California. He joined NASA Astronaut Group 7 in August 1969 after the cancellation of the MOL program. At NASA, he was a member of the astronaut support crew and capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for all three of the crewed Skylab missions in 1973, and the Apollo–Soyuz mission in 1975. He flew twice on one of the two-man crews for the 1977 Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and on the STS-2 mission in 1981, becoming the first man to be launched into space on his birthday. Truly then served as commander of STS-8 in 1983.

After STS-8, Truly left NASA to become the first commander of the Naval Space Command.

===Return to flight===
Three weeks after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, Truly returned to NASA to become NASA&#x27;s Associate Administrator for Space Flight on February 20, 1986. His primary task was to watch over the Space Shuttle&#x27;s return to flight status. Along with that, he was also responsible for such long term issues as whether or not &quot;Challenger&quot; would be replaced, the role the Shuttle would play in the future and the mixture of expendable spacecraft and the shuttle for upcoming missions. While it only took a few days to determine the technical reason for the accident, sorting out the root cause was more difficult. In the end, it took Truly and NASA&#x27;s &quot;Return to Flight&quot; program 31 months before the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; successfully flew on September 29, 1988, with STS-26. In March 1986, Truly noted in a memo that there were several actions NASA needed to accomplish before launching another Shuttle flight. They included &quot;Solid Rocket Motor joint redesign, Critical Items review, and Operations and Maintenance Instructions review&quot;.

===NASA Administrator===
Truly retired from the Navy as a vice admiral shortly before becoming NASA administrator. He was named to head NASA as its eighth administrator in May 1989, the first astronaut to do so. He held this position until May 1992. He was credited by Carl Sagan with interceding in an internal dispute regarding whether &quot;Voyager 1&quot; should be commanded to take one last photograph of Earth before completing its primary mission. The resulting photograph has since become known as the &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot; photograph.

On February 12, 1992, Truly was fired as Administrator. Two weeks before, Vice President Dan Quayle had met with Truly, requesting the Administrator step down and accept an ambassadorship. Truly considered the offer but ultimately declined.

When he was fired, Truly said, &quot;I&#x27;m floored. I can&#x27;t explain it&quot;. Senator Al Gore, who would succeed Quayle as vice president a year later, said he was concerned about the move, stating that Truly was &quot;a good man who did a good job under difficult circumstances&quot; and that &quot;I view this as a very troubling sign that ... Quayle&#x27;s space council may have forced Admiral Truly to leave this job because of the council&#x27;s insistence on running NASA from the vice president&#x27;s office.&quot;

Observers suggested the firing was due to Truly&#x27;s focus on large-scale projects like extending the life of the Space Shuttle rather than smaller, faster missions favored by the administration. It was suggested &quot;that he was captive of his bureaucracy and incapable of making the changes, the reforms, the administration wanted.&quot; Others pointed to the battle over the International Space Station, which unexpectedly ran into serious problems in Congress, requiring the administration to intervene to save it.

==Post-NASA activities==
After leaving NASA, Truly became Vice President and Director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute, part of the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta, Georgia. He served in this role from 1992 to 1997.

Then he served as director of the Department of Energy&#x27;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory and as executive vice president of the MRIGlobal (formerly Midwest Research Institute) from 1997–2005.

In May 2007, Retired Vice Admiral Richard Truly testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as a member of a military advisory board on the subject of the threats to U.S. national security posed by global climate change.

In 2010, Truly was appointed to the board of trustees of the Colorado School of Mines by Governor Bill Ritter. He served as the vice chairman of the board.

==Personal life and death==
Truly was married to Colleen &quot;Cody&quot; Hanner, and had three children. He died at his home in Genesee, Colorado, on February 27, 2024, at the age of 86.

==Decorations==

Truly was awarded the following military decorations and government awards:


In 1988, he was awarded the Society of Experimental Test Pilots James H. Doolittle Award. He also received that year the Collier Trophy for his role in assisting NASA&#x27;s return to launching crewed missions after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. He was awarded the Johnson Space Center Superior Achievement Award in 1972. He also received the American Astronautical Society&#x27;s Flight Achievement Award in 1977. In 1995, he was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. He was awarded the General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy for 1981.

<doc id="503139" wikidata="Q518935" url="?curid=503139" title="Wiglaf of Mercia">
<text>Wiglaf (died 839) was King of Mercia from 827 to 829 and again from 830 until his death in 839. His ancestry is uncertain: the 820s were a period of dynastic conflict within Mercia and the genealogy of several of the kings of this time is unknown. Wigstan, his grandson, was later recorded as a descendant of Penda of Mercia, so it is possible that Wiglaf was descended from Penda, one of the most powerful seventh-century kings of Mercia.

Wiglaf succeeded Ludeca, who was killed campaigning against East Anglia. His first reign coincided with the continued rise of the rival Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex under Ecgberht. Ecgberht drove Wiglaf from the throne in 829, and ruled Mercia directly for a year. Wiglaf recovered the kingdom in 830, probably by force, although it may be that Wiglaf remained subject to Ecgberht&#x27;s overlordship. Mercia never regained the south-eastern kingdoms, but Berkshire and perhaps Essex came back into Mercian control. The causes of the fluctuating fortunes of Mercia and Wessex are a matter of speculation, but it may be that Carolingian support influenced both Ecgberht&#x27;s ascendancy and the subsequent Mercian recovery. Although Wiglaf appeared to have restored Mercia&#x27;s independence, the recovery was short-lived, and later in the century Mercia was divided between Wessex and the Vikings.

Wiglaf died in about 839, and was eventually succeeded by Beorhtwulf, though one tradition records his son, Wigmund as having reigned briefly. Wiglaf is buried at Repton, near Derby.

==Historical context==
Mercia had been the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom for most of the 8th century, with Offa, who died in 796, the most powerful king of his time. Coenwulf, who took the Mercian throne shortly after Offa&#x27;s death, was able to retain Mercian influence in the kingdoms of Kent, East Anglia and Essex, and made frequent incursions across Offa&#x27;s Dyke into what is now Wales. Coenwulf&#x27;s death, in 821, marked the beginning of a period in which the political map of England was dramatically redrawn. Although one eleventh-century source claims that Coenwulf&#x27;s son, Cynehelm, briefly succeeded to the throne, it is more likely that Ceolwulf, Coenwulf&#x27;s brother, was the next king. He reigned for only two years before being deposed.

The next king, Beornwulf, was of no known royal line, though it has been conjectured on the basis of the common initial letter B that he was connected to the later kings Beorhtwulf and Burgred. It was probably Beornwulf whose defeat of the kingdom of Powys and destruction of the fortress of Deganwy are recorded in a Welsh chronicle, the &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;, in 823, and it is clear that Mercia was still a formidable military power at that time. In 825 Beornwulf was decisively defeated by Ecgberht, King of Wessex, at the battle of Ellendun, and died the next year in an unsuccessful invasion of East Anglia. His successor, Ludeca, of unknown lineage, also invaded East Anglia, and, like Beornwulf, died while campaigning there, in 827. These defeats, in rapid succession, are likely to have exacerbated the apparent dynastic contention for Mercian royal authority. Outside Mercia, the power of the kingdom of Wessex to the south was strong and growing when Wiglaf came to the throne.

==Ancestry==
Wiglaf&#x27;s ancestry is not known for certain. There are two main theories regarding the ancestry of Mercian kings of this period. One is that descendants of different lines of the royal family competed for the throne. In the mid-7th century, for example, Penda had placed royal kinsmen in control of conquered provinces. A Wigheard, who witnessed a charter in the late 7th century, was possibly a member of this line. The other theory is that a number of kin-groups with local power-bases may have competed for the succession. The sub-kingdoms of the Hwicce, the Tomsæte, and the unidentified Gaini are examples of such power-bases. Marriage alliances could also have played a part. Competing magnates, those called in charters &quot;dux&quot; or &quot;princeps&quot; (that is, leaders), may have brought the kings to power. In this model, the Mercian kings are little more than leading noblemen.

A medieval tradition preserved at Evesham records that Wiglaf&#x27;s grandson Wigstan was a descendant of Coenred, who was a grandson of Penda. Wigstan&#x27;s grandfathers were Wiglaf and Ceolwulf I; the tradition might be interpreted to mean that Wiglaf descended from Penda, but it might also be Wiglaf&#x27;s wife, Cynethryth, who was descended from Penda. Cynethryth&#x27;s name is known from two of Wiglaf&#x27;s charters, dated 831 and 836, and historian Pauline Stafford notes that her name &quot;seems to hark back to the kin of Coenwulf if not earlier royal lines&quot;, but as with Wiglaf himself, nothing certain is known of her ancestry. A different connection is mentioned in the medieval &quot;Life of St. Wigstan&quot;, which asserts that the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;W&quot; families were related.

Known descendants of Wiglaf include his son, Wigmund, and his grandson, Wigstan, both of whom share the &quot;Wig-&quot; at the start of his name; alliterative family names are frequent in Anglo-Saxon dynasties and are often thought to suggest possible kinship. Other possible descendants of Wiglaf include the last Mercian king, Ceolwulf II. A large number of &quot;duces&quot; or &quot;praefecti&quot; (ealdormen) with similar names are found as witnesses in Mercian charters of the late 8th and early 9th centuries, including Wigbald, Wigberht, Wigcga, Wigferth, and Wigheard, but there is no evidence that these nobles were related beyond the similarity of their names.

==First reign and defeat by Wessex==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records Wiglaf&#x27;s accession in the entry for 827 (erroneously recorded under the year 825). The entry reads &quot;Her Ludecan Myrcna cing 7 his fif ealdormenn mid him man ofsloh, 7 Wiglaf feng to rice&quot;, which means &quot;Here Ludeca, King of Mercia, was killed, and his five ealdormen with him, and Wiglaf succeeded to the kingdom&quot;. In 829, Ecgberht of Wessex successfully invaded Mercia and drove Wiglaf from his throne. The immediate consequence of Ecgberht&#x27;s defeat of Beornwulf in 825 at the battle of Ellendun had been the loss of Mercian control over the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, Essex and East Anglia; Beornwulf&#x27;s and Ludeca&#x27;s disastrous military expeditions against East Anglia in 826 and 827 also confirmed Mercia&#x27;s loss of control of that kingdom. Ecgberht&#x27;s defeat of Wiglaf in 829 completed his domination of southern England, and Ecgberht went on to receive the submission of Eanred of Northumbria at Dore, on the northern border of Mercia, later that year. These events led the anonymous scribe who wrote the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; to describe Ecgberht as the eighth &quot;bretwalda&quot;, or &#x27;Ruler of Britain&#x27;.

Ecgberht remained in control of Mercia until some time in 830. He was in power there long enough to issue coins (struck in London) bearing the title &quot;Rex M&quot;, for &quot;Rex Merciorum&quot;, or &quot;King of Mercia&quot;.

==Second reign==
The &quot;Chronicle&quot; reports that in 830, Wiglaf &quot;obtained the kingdom of Mercia again&quot;. Wiglaf&#x27;s return to the throne has generally been taken by historians to indicate the end of Ecgberht&#x27;s overlordship of Mercia. In particular, historian Frank Stenton argued that the wording of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; makes it probable that Wiglaf recovered the kingdom by force, and that if Ecgberht had given the kingdom to Wiglaf this would have been recorded. A charter of 836 has also been cited as evidence that Wiglaf was acting as an independent ruler at that time; it records a council at Croft, in Leicestershire, attended by the Archbishop of Canterbury and eleven bishops, including some from West Saxon sees. Wiglaf refers to the assembly as &quot;my bishops, &quot;duces&quot;, and magistrates&quot;, indicating not only a recovery of control over his own territory, but some level of authority over the southern church. It is significant that Wiglaf was still able to call together such a group of notables; the West Saxons, even if they were able to do so, held no such councils. Essex, which had been a Mercian dependency, may have been brought back under Mercian overlordship: a King Sigeric of the East Saxons, described as a &quot;minister&quot; of Wiglaf&#x27;s, witnessed a charter in Hertfordshire at some point between 829 and 837. London, where Ecgberht apparently lost control of the mint, remained a Mercian town through Wiglaf&#x27;s second reign and beyond. Berkshire also appears to have returned to Mercian control, though it is possible that this did not occur until after Wiglaf&#x27;s reign. Perhaps more surprisingly, given the new strength of Wessex, it appears that the territory along the middle Thames which had formed the heartland of the Gewisse (the precursor people of the 9th-century West Saxon state) remained firmly in Mercian hands. In the west, either Wiglaf or his successor, Beorhtwulf, brought the Welsh back under Mercian control at some point prior to 853, when a rebellion against Mercia is recorded.

A charter of 831, which Wiglaf calls &quot;the first year of my second reign&quot;, was issued at Wychbold near Droitwich; it is significant that Wiglaf makes no reference to any overlordship of Ecgberht&#x27;s in this charter, issued within a year of his recovery of power, and that he acknowledges his temporary deposition. In East Anglia, King Æthelstan minted coins, possibly as early as 827, but more likely c. 830 after Ecgberht&#x27;s influence was reduced with Wiglaf&#x27;s return to power in Mercia. This demonstration of independence on East Anglia&#x27;s part is not surprising, as it was probably Æthelstan who was responsible for the defeat and death of both Beornwulf and Ludeca.

Both Wessex&#x27;s sudden rise to power in the late 820s, and the subsequent failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for underlying causes. Dynastic uncertainty has been suggested as the reason for Mercia&#x27;s collapse; the 820s were certainly years of instability in the royal line. The lack of detailed information about Mercian and Wessex administration makes other theories hard to evaluate: for example, it has been suggested that the West Saxons had a stable tributary system that contributed to its success, or that Wessex&#x27;s mixed Saxon and British population, natural frontiers, and capable administrators were key factors.

Another proposed explanation for the events of these years is that Wessex&#x27;s fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious, the first of a series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have reduced Louis&#x27;s ability to support Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.

Wiglaf&#x27;s recovery was not complete. Ecgberht&#x27;s influence was certainly reduced after 830, but Mercia never recovered control of the south-east, except possibly for Essex, and East Anglia remained independent. It appears that Wulfred, the archbishop of Canterbury at the time of Ecgberht&#x27;s victory, remained loyal to Mercia: his coinage terminates when Ecgberht&#x27;s Kentish coinage begins; and, since a charter of 838 shows Ecgberht agreeing to return property to the church in Canterbury, it is evident that he had seized property from the church earlier. Æthelwulf, Ecgberht&#x27;s son, was king of Kent during his father&#x27;s reign, and fear of continuing Mercian influence in Kent may have been the reason he gave estates to Christ Church, Canterbury.

Coins from Wiglaf&#x27;s reign are very rare. They can be divided into portrait and non-portrait types, and, of these, only the two non-portrait coins may be from Wiglaf&#x27;s second reign. Other than these, there is no evidence of any Mercian coinage until the reign of Wiglaf&#x27;s successor, Beorhtwulf, which began in about 840. This may show that Wiglaf remained subject to Ecgberht&#x27;s overlordship after 830, though most historians consider Wiglaf to have recovered his independence at that time.

Charters survive from Wiglaf&#x27;s reign; these were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and were witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land. One such charter of Wiglaf&#x27;s, granting privileges to the monastery of Hanbury in 836, does not exempt the monks from the duty of constructing ramparts, indicating a concern for defence. Wessex charters do not begin to show such exemptions until 846. These clauses are explained by the increasing Viking presence throughout Britain: Viking raids had begun at least as early as 793, Viking armies were in Kent by 811, and from 835 Viking raids were a concern for the kings of Wessex.

The 836 charter also contains an early reference to the &quot;trimoda necessitas&quot;, the set of three obligations that kings of the era placed on their subjects. These duties were the building of royal residences, the obligation to pay &quot;feorm&quot;, or food rent, to the king, and hospitality to the king&#x27;s servants. The privileges granted came at a cost: Wiglaf and one ealdorman received life interests in estates, and another ealdorman was paid six hundred shillings in gold. It is perhaps notable that, in common with many other Mercian charters of the 9th century, this grant is of privileges rather than land: the chronicler Bede had commented a century earlier that excessive grants of land to monasteries were leaving kings without land to grant to the nobility, and the Mercian kings may have been responding to this problem.

==Succession==
The date of Wiglaf&#x27;s death is not given directly in any of the primary sources, but it can be determined from the known chronology of his successors. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Burgred was driven out of Mercia by the Vikings in 874, after a reign of twenty-two years, and charter evidence indicates that Burgred succeeded in the first half of 852. A regnal list credits his predecessor, Beorhtwulf, with a reign of thirteen years, which is consistent with date references in his charters. Hence it would appear that Wiglaf&#x27;s reign ended in 839. A tradition records the death of Wigstan in 849, and refers to Wigstan&#x27;s father, Wigmund, the son of Wiglaf, as having been king, but this is the only evidence for Wigmund having reigned and must be regarded with suspicion. The descent of Beorhtwulf is not known, but it appears that dynastic tension was a continuing factor in the Mercian succession, in contrast to Wessex, where Ecgberht established a dynasty that lasted with little disturbance throughout the 9th century.

Wiglaf was buried at Repton, in a crypt which still can be seen. The monastery church on the site at that time was probably constructed by Æthelbald of Mercia to house the royal mausoleum; other burials there include that of Wigstan, Wiglaf&#x27;s grandson. The vault and columns in the crypt are not original and may date from Wiglaf&#x27;s time rather than Aethelbald&#x27;s.

<text>VISCII is an unofficially-defined modified ASCII character encoding for using the Vietnamese language with computers. It should not be confused with the similarly-named officially registered VSCII encoding. VISCII keeps the 95 printable characters of ASCII unmodified, but it replaces 6 of the 33 control characters with printable characters. It adds 128 precomposed characters. Unicode and the Windows-1258 code page are now used for virtually all Vietnamese computer data, but legacy VSCII and VISCII files may need conversion.

==History and naming==
VISCII was designed by the Vietnamese Standardization Working Group (Viet-Std Group) led by Christopher Cuong T. Nguyen, Cuong M. Bui, and Hoc D. Ngo based in Silicon Valley, California in 1992 while they were working with the Unicode consortium to include pre-composed Vietnamese characters in the Unicode standard. VISCII, along with VIQR, was first published in a bilingual report in September 1992, in which it was dubbed the &quot;Vietnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange&quot;. The report noted a proliferation in computer usage in Vietnam and the increasing volume of computer-based communications among Vietnamese abroad, that existing applications used vendor-specific encodings which were unable to interoperate with one another, and that standardisation between vendors was therefore necessary. The successful inclusion of composed and precomposed Vietnamese in Unicode 1.0 was the result of the lessons learned from the development of 8-bit VISCII and 7-bit VIQR.

The next year, in 1993, Vietnam adopted TCVN 5712, its first national standard in the information technology domain. This defined a character encoding named VSCII, which had been developed by the TCVN Technical Committee on Information Technology (TCVN/TC1), and with its name standing for &quot;Vietnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange&quot;. VSCII is incompatible with, and otherwise unrelated to, the earlier-published VISCII. Unlike VISCII, VSCII is a &quot;Vietnamese Standard&quot; in the sense of a national standard.

VISCII and VIQR were approved as the informational-status , attributed to the Viet-Std group and dated May 1993. As is the case with IETF RFCs, RFC 1456 notes them to be &quot;conventions&quot; used by overseas Vietnamese speakers on Usenet, and that it &quot;specifies no level of standard&quot;. In spite of this, it continues to call VISCII the &quot;VIetnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange&quot; (the same name taken by VSCII). The labels codice_1 and codice_2 are registered with the IANA for VISCII, with reference to RFC 1456. (There is, on the other hand, no official IANA label for TCVN 5712 / VSCII, although codice_3 was previously supported by Mozilla Firefox.)

==Design==
A traditional extended ASCII character set consists of the ASCII set plus up to 128 characters. Vietnamese requires 134 additional letter-diacritic combinations, which is six too many. There are (short of dropping tone mark support for capital letters, as in VSCII-3) essentially four different ways to handle this problem:
#Use variable-width encoding (as does UTF-8)
#Include combining diacritical marks for tone marks (as do VSCII-2 and Windows-1258) or for diacritics in general (as do ANSEL and VNI)
#Replace some ASCII punctuation, preferably punctuation which is not invariant in ISO 646 (as does VNI for DOS)
#Replace at least six of the basic ASCII control characters (as do VPS and VSCII-1)

VISCII went for the last option, replacing six of the least problematic (e.g., least likely to be recognised by an application and acted on specially) C0 control codes (STX, ENQ, ACK, DC4, EM, and RS) with six of the least-used uppercase letter-diacritic combinations. While this option may cause programs that use those control codes to malfunction when handling VISCII text, it creates fewer complications than the other two options (the designers note that non-8-bit clean transmission had been found to pose more difficulty in practice than the control character re-use). Nonetheless, locations of both C0 or C1 control characters and the codes used for the non-breaking space in ISO-8859-1, Mac OS Roman and OEM-US were deliberately assigned to uppercase letters, with the intention of making use of lowercase codepoints with an all-capital font a serviceable workaround if graphical characters could not be displayed for those codes.

However, using up all the extended code points for accented letters left no room to add useful symbols, superscripted numbers, curved quotes, proper dashes, etc., like most other extended ASCII character sets.

Location of characters deliberately mostly follows ISO-8859-1 where there are characters in common between the two code pages (the uppercase Õ being noted as an exception), motivated by user friendliness concerns.

==Support==
VISCII is partially supported by the TriChlor Software Group in California, which has released various VISCII-compliant software packages, libraries, and fonts for MS-DOS and Windows, Unix, and Macintosh. VISCII-compliant software is available at many FTP sites.

VISCII was historically offered as an encoding for outgoing email by Mozilla Thunderbird. It was also supported by the Windows Vietnamese keyboard software, WinVNKey, created by Christopher Cuong T. Nguyen and later upgraded through various Windows versions by Hoc D. Ngo and others.

VISCII was mostly used by overseas Vietnamese speakers, with VSCII (TCVN) being more popular in northern Vietnam and VNI being more popular in southern Vietnam.

<text>The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine (; ) was a treaty between the victorious Allies of World War I on the one hand, and Bulgaria, one of the defeated Central Powers in World War I, on the other. The treaty required Bulgaria to cede various territories. 

The treaty was signed on 27 November 1919, in Neuilly-sur-Seine in the Hauts-de-Seine department, just west of Paris in France. The signing ceremony was held in the Hôtel de Ville (town hall) at Neuilly.

The Treaty of Neuilly was one of the series of treaties after World War I, which included the Treaty of Versailles, the Treaty of Saint-Germain, the Treaty of Trianon, and the Treaty of Sèvres, which were intended to diminish the military and political strength of the defeated members of the Central Powers. 

Like those treaties, the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine contained the Covenant of the League of Nations. As a result the United States did not ratify the treaty.

==Territorial concessions==
The treaty required Bulgaria: 
*to cede Western Thrace to the Entente (which awarded it to Greece at the San Remo conference) thereby cutting off Bulgaria&#x27;s direct outlet to the Aegean Sea. 
*to sign a convention on population exchange with Greece.
*to cede a further area of on its western border with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia).
*to return Dobruja, which according to the Treaty of Bucharest was partially ceded to Bulgaria and partially to the Central Powers (who later, on 25 September 1918, transferred this joint condominium to Bulgaria), to Romania, thus restoring the border set by the Treaty of Bucharest (1913).
*to return property removed from the occupied territory liberated by Bulgarian forces to its rightful owners, or to make compensation. 
*to reduce its army to 20,000 men.
*to pay reparations of £100 million.
*to recognize the existence of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

== Bulgarian response==
In Bulgaria, the results of the treaty are popularly known as the Second National Catastrophe. Bulgaria subsequently regained Southern Dobruja as a result of the Treaty of Craiova. During World War II, together with Nazi Germany, it temporarily reoccupied most of the other territories ceded under the treaty.

== Territories ceded to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ==
Four minor regions (historiographically referred to by Bulgarians as the Western Outlands) had been part of Bulgaria from its inception as a principality in 1878, except for the region around Strumitsa, which became part of Bulgaria in 1912. Bulgaria was internationally recognised as an independent country in 1908 and controlled these territories until 1919 when they were ceded to the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes under the Treaty of Neuilly. The cession of the region was partly a compensation for the occupation of the southern and eastern part of Serbia by Bulgarian troops between 1915 and 1918, and was partly motivated by strategic reasons. The old political boundary between Bulgaria and Serbia followed a chain of high mountain ridges, whereas the new one gave significant military and strategic advantages to the Serbs: it dangerously exposed the Bulgarian capital of Sofia and significantly reduced the military threat to eastern Serbia in case of a Bulgarian invasion (see also Balkan Wars and World War I).

===Area and population===

Territories ceded by the treaty to the then Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes cover an area of in what is now Serbia and in what is now North Macedonia.

In Serbia, to which the term generally applies in Bulgaria, the territory ceded is split between the modern Serbian District of Pirot (municipality of Dimitrovgrad and smaller parts of the municipalities of Pirot and Babušnica) and District of Pčinja (municipality of Bosilegrad and a small part of the municipality of Surdulica). It also includes a small section along the Timok River in the municipality and District of Zaječar, composed by eight localities (seven populated by Romanians and one populated by Bulgarians).

In 1919, the area corresponded to the following parts of the Bulgarian &quot;okrugs&quot;: Kyustendil, , Tzaribrod , Tran , Kula and Vidin . Bulgarian sources claim that the Bulgarian population made 98% of the population in Bosilegrad and 95% of the population in Tzaribrod at the time. In the Yugoslav census of 1931, all South Slavs were simply counted as Yugoslavs (Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Bulgarians) so a comparison could not be made. According to the last Census in Serbia from 2002, Bulgarians made 50% and 71% of population in Dimitrovgrad and Bosilegrad respectively.

<text>Windows-1258 is a code page used in Microsoft Windows to represent Vietnamese texts. It makes use of combining diacritical marks.

Windows-1258 is compatible with neither the Vietnamese standard (TCVN 5712 / VSCII), nor the various other encodings in use in practice (VISCII, VNI, VPS). Rather, it is very similar to Windows-1252, with the differences being that s-caron and z-caron (which were added to Windows-1252 later) are missing, five of the letters with diacritics have been replaced by combining diacritics for Vietnamese tone marks, one has been replaced with the đông sign, and eight others (four per case) have been changed to four otherwise-unsupported Vietnamese letters.

Use of combining diacritics means that Windows-1258 can cover the large number of combinations of letters and tone marks in Vietnamese without compromising coverage of control codes or symbols. However it also means that software must be careful to handle conversions between precomposed characters and combining sequences correctly when converting to/from other encodings and makes determining user-visible length of a string more difficult.

IBM uses code page 1258 (CCSID 1258 and euro sign extended CCSID 5354) for Windows-1258.

UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for Vietnamese in modern applications. Windows-1258 may not always round-trip Unicode encoded Vietnamese due to changes caused by Unicode normalization. Combining diacritics are encoded after the letter in both Windows-1258 and Unicode (like VNI, unlike ANSEL).

IBM&#x27;s code page 1129 (CCSID 1129 and euro sign extended CCSID 1163) is similar to code page 1258, but with the following differences:

<text>Ef or Fe (Ф ф; italics: &quot;Ф ф&quot;) is a Cyrillic letter, commonly representing the voiceless labiodental fricative , like the pronunciation of in &quot;fill, flee, or fall&quot;. The Cyrillic letter Ef is romanized as .

==History==

The Cyrillic letter Ef was derived from the Greek letter Phi (Φ φ). It merged with and eliminated the letter Fita (Ѳ) in the Russian alphabet in 1918.

The name of Ef in the Early Cyrillic alphabet is ( or ), in later Church Slavonic and Russian form it became ().

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Ef has a value of 500.

==Appearance and usage in Slavic languages==
The Slavic languages have almost no native words containing . This sound did not exist in Proto-Indo-European (PIE). It arose in Greek and Latin from PIE (which yielded Slavic ). In some instances in Latin, it represented historical th-fronting and derived from Proto-Indo-European . In the Germanic languages, the f sound arose from PIE via Grimm&#x27;s law, which remained unchanged in Slavic. The letter ф is thus almost exclusively found in words of foreign origin, especially Greek (from &quot;φ&quot; and sometimes from &quot;θ&quot;), Latin, French, German, Dutch, English, and Turkic languages

Example borrowings in Russian:
* from Greek: , &quot;catastrophe&quot; (from &quot;φ&quot;); , &quot;Theodore&quot; (from &quot;θ&quot;; cf. Bulgarian )
* from Latin: , &quot;federation&quot;; , &quot;effect&quot;
* from German: , &quot;potato&quot; (from &quot;Kartoffel&quot;); , &quot;pound&quot; (from &quot;Pfund&quot;)
* from Dutch: , &quot;flag&quot;
* from English: , &quot;office&quot;
* from French: , &quot;France&quot;

The few native Slavic words with this letter (in different languages) are examples of onomatopoeia (like Russian verbs , etc.) or reflect sporadic pronunciation shifts:
* from &quot;пв&quot; : Serbian &#x27;to hope&#x27; (cf. Church Slavonic &#x27;to hope&#x27;)
* from &quot;хв&quot; : Macedonian &#x27;(he) understands&#x27; (cf. Church Slavonic &#x27;to take, to catch&#x27;), Russian &#x27;bustard&#x27; (cf. Ukrainian &#x27;bustard&#x27;)
* from &quot;кв&quot; : Russian &#x27;eagle-owl&#x27; (cf. Ukrainian &#x27;to cry&#x27;)
* from &quot;х&quot; : Russian toponym &#x27;Fili&#x27; (from &#x27;sickly&#x27;)

===Slavic languages===
Ef is the 21st letter of the Bulgarian alphabet; the 22nd letter of the Russian alphabet; the 23rd letter of the Belarusian alphabet; the 25th letter of the Serbian and Ukrainian alphabet; and the 26th letter of the Macedonian alphabet. It represents the consonant unless it is before a palatalizing vowel, when it represents .

<text>Levi Strauss &amp; Co. ( ) is an American clothing company known worldwide for its Levi&#x27;s ( ) brand of denim jeans. It was founded in May 1853 when German-Jewish immigrant Levi Strauss moved from Buttenheim, Bavaria, to San Francisco, California, to open a West Coast branch of his brothers&#x27; New York dry goods business. Although the corporation is registered in Delaware, the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters is located in Levi&#x27;s Plaza in San Francisco.

==History==
===Origin and formation (1853–1890s)===

German-Jewish immigrant Levi Strauss began business at 90 Sacramento Street in San Francisco, then moved to 62 Sacramento Street. In 1858, the company was listed as &quot;Strauss, Levi (David Stern &amp; Lewis Strauss) importers clothing, etc. 63 &amp; 65 Sacramento St.&quot; (today, on the current grounds of the 353 Sacramento Street Lobby) in the San Francisco Directory with Strauss serving as its sales manager and his brother-in-law, David Stern, as its manager.

Jacob Davis, a Latvian-Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada, tailor who frequently purchased bolts of denim cloth from Levi Strauss &amp; Co.&#x27;s wholesale house. After one of Davis&#x27;s customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he thought of using copper rivets to reinforce points of strain, such as on pocket corners and the base of the button fly. Davis lacked sufficient funds to obtain a patent, so he wrote to Strauss proposing a business partnership. After Strauss accepted Davis&#x27;s offer, the two men received from the United States Patent and Trademark Office on May 20, 1873. The copper rivet was incorporated into the company&#x27;s jean design and advertisements. Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls began in the 1870s. In 1890, the rivet patent went into the public domain; the same year, lot numbers were assigned to company products, and &quot;501&quot; was used to designate the famous copper-riveted waist overalls. The company lost its records in the 1906 earthquake and there is no information why that number was chosen.

There are urban legends claiming that the first pair of Levi&#x27;s jeans were made of hemp, in despite being made from cotton by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company. This misinformation was likely spread by Jack Herer. The first hemp jeans from Levi&#x27;s were manufactured in March 2019.

===Growth in popularity (1910s–1960s)===

Modern jeans began to appear in the 1920s, but sales were largely confined to the working people of the western US, such as cowboys, lumberjacks, and railroad workers. Levi&#x27;s jeans were first introduced to the East during the dude ranch craze of the 1930s, when vacationing Easterners returned home with tales (and usually examples) of the hard-wearing riveted denim pants. Another boost came in World War II when blue jeans were declared an essential commodity and sold only to people engaged in defense work.

Between the 1950s and 1980s, Levi&#x27;s jeans became popular among a wide range of youth subcultures, including greasers, mods, rockers, and hippies. Levi&#x27;s popular shrink-to-fit 501s were sold as labeled, sized as manufactured, and had substantial shrinkage upon laundering. Although popular lore (abetted by company marketing) holds that the original design remains unaltered, the crotch rivet, watch pocket rivets, and waist cinch were removed during World War II to conform with War Production Board metal conservation rules and only the watch pocket rivets restored after. Additionally, the back pocket rivets, which had been covered in denim since 1937 to prevent scratching furniture, were removed in the 1950s (and replaced by bar tacks) as they eventually wore through and caused the problem anyway.

===Blue jeans era (1960s–1980s)===

From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss experienced significant business growth as the casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the &quot;blue jeans craze&quot;. Levi&#x27;s, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco, and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm&#x27;s clothing line by adding new fashions and models, such as &quot;stone-washed&quot; jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer, a technique still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company&#x27;s record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 in the US – and 23 overseas – from 1964 to 1974.

In the 1980s, the company closed approximately 60 manufacturing plants because of financial difficulties and strong competition.

The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 and sold primarily through department store chains, helped the company grow through the mid-1990s, as denim sales began to wane. Dockers were introduced into Europe in 1996 and led by CEO Jorge Bardina. Levi Strauss attempted to sell the Dockers division in 2004 to relieve part of the company&#x27;s $2.6 billion outstanding debt.

===Brand competition (1990s)===

By the 1990s, Levi&#x27;s faced competition from other brands and cheaper products from overseas and began accelerating the pace of its US factory closures and its use of offshore subcontractors. In 1991, Levi Strauss became implicated in a scandal involving pants made in the Northern Mariana Islands: some 3% of Levi&#x27;s jeans sold annually with the &quot;Made in the USA&quot; label were shown to have been made by Chinese laborers under what the U.S. Department of Labor called slave-like conditions. , only a few of the costlier higher-end styles are made domestically.

Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions, and other workplace abuses, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss&#x27; Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in US labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees. Levi Strauss claimed no knowledge of the offenses, severed ties to the Tan family, and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.

The activist group Fuerza Unida (United Force) formed following the January 1990 closure of a plant in San Antonio, Texas, in which 1,150 seamstresses – some of whom had worked for Levi Strauss for decades – saw their jobs exported to Costa Rica. During the mid-and late 1990s, Fuerza Unida picketed the Levi Strauss headquarters in San Francisco and staged hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest of the company&#x27;s labor policies.

The company took on multibillion-dollar debt in February 1996 to help finance a series of private leveraged stock buyouts among family members determined to consolidate the company under their ownership. At the time, shares in Levi Strauss stock were not publicly traded. As of 2016, the firm was owned almost entirely by indirect descendants and collateral relatives of Levi Strauss, whose four nephews inherited the San Francisco dry-goods firm after their uncle died in 1902. The corporation&#x27;s bonds are traded publicly, as are shares of the company&#x27;s Japanese affiliate, Levi Strauss Japan K.K.

In June 1996, the company offered to pay its workers an unusual dividend of up to $750 million in six years, having halted an employee-stock plan during the internal family buyout. However, the company failed to make cash-flow targets, and no worker dividends were paid.

The annual sales of the brand increased in 1997 to $7.1 billion.

===Later developments (2000–present)===

In 2002, Levi Strauss began a close business collaboration with Walmart, producing a line of &quot;Signature&quot; jeans and other clothes for sale only in Walmart stores until 2006.

In 2002, the company closed its Valencia Street plant in San Francisco, which opened in 1906, the year of the city&#x27;s devastating earthquake. By the end of 2003, the closure of Levi&#x27;s last U.S. factory in San Antonio ended 150 years of jeans made in the United States. Production of a few higher-end, more expensive styles of jeans resumed in the U.S. several years later.

In 2002, Levi Strauss closed several factories worldwide and took control of GWG&#x27;s operations. Attempts to make the GWG brand profitable again were unsuccessful, and the Edmonton GWG factory, along with all remaining Levi Strauss factories in North America, closed in 2004.

By 2007, Levi Strauss was again profitable after declining sales in nine of the previous ten years. Its total annual sales of just over $4 billion were $3 billion less than during its peak performance in the mid-1990s. After more than two decades of family ownership, rumors of a possible public stock offering appeared in the media in July 2007.

, Levi Strauss leads the apparel industry in trademark infringement cases, filing nearly 100 lawsuits against competitors over six years from 2001. Most cases center on the alleged imitation of Levi&#x27;s back pocket double arc stitching pattern (U.S. trademark No. 1,139,254), which Levi&#x27;s filed for a trademark in 1978. Levi&#x27;s has successfully sued Guess, Polo Ralph Lauren, Esprit Holdings, Zegna, Zumiez, and Lucky Brand Jeans, among other companies.

In 2010, the company partnered with Filson, an outdoor goods manufacturer in Seattle, to produce a high-end line of jackets and workwear.

In 2011, the firm hired Chip Bergh as the president and chief executive of the brand. In that same year, they established more than 20 different waterless manufacturing techniques, reducing the exceptionally high amounts of water used to create denim. Levi&#x27;s is now the world&#x27;s most sustainable brand of jeans in terms of water usage.

On May 8, 2013, the NFL&#x27;s San Francisco 49ers announced that Levi Strauss &amp; Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The naming rights deal called for Levi&#x27;s to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and the 49ers over 20 years, with an option to extend the agreement for another five years for around $75 million.

, Levi Strauss Signature jeans were sold in 110 countries. In 2016, the company reported revenues of $4.6 billion.

On July 13, 2017, Levi Strauss heir Bill Goldman died in a private plane crash near Sonoma, California.

In 2017, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. released a &quot;smart jacket&quot;, an apparel they developed in partnership with Google. After two years of collaboration, the result was a denim jacket set at $350.

In March 2019, Levi&#x27;s debuted on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker &quot;LEVI&quot;. Levi Strauss was valued at $6.6 billion as its IPO priced above the target.

In September 2019, Levi&#x27;s won a final judgment on a trademark infringement in Guangzhou, China. The case centered on the &quot;arcuate design on two pockets at the back of jeans&quot;, which has been protected in China since its registration there in 2005. The company won damages and costs in addition to a ban on future infringements. The infringer&#x27;s ignorance of the trademark was no bar to punishment.

In 2019, Levi&#x27;s became one of only two major clothing companies with commitments in line with the Paris Agreement&#x27;s goal of limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

In 2020, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. was expected to have completely replaced chemical usage as well as using lasers to cut, and design ripped parts of jeans. In December 2019, the Engage for Good (formerly Cause Marketing Forum) organization awarded the company the Golden Halo Award for 2020 for their advancements in corporate social impact.

On August 5, 2021, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. announced the acquisition of Beyond Yoga, entering the activewear market. They expect the acquisition will contribute more than $100 million in net revenue per year. It was announced senior executives are to speak with AI expert Blake Van Leer at the LA eCommerce Summit about their digital strategies and AI in 2023. It was announced in January 2023 that Levi would begin accepting old pairs of jeans to recycle into more denim in a campaign to go green. Levi&#x27;s Autumn/Winter 2023 WellThread capsule aimed to show the brand&#x27;s engagement to sustainability as it included items made from 100% transitional cotton as well as plant-based natural dyes.

==Cultural impact==
Levi&#x27;s have been worn by people of all backgrounds – from miners to actors to Nobel Prize recipients. Marlon Brando and Albert Einstein wore Levi&#x27;s, and Einstein wore a 1930s-era Levi&#x27;s leather jacket, which sold at auction house Christie&#x27;s in July 2016 for £110,500.

Levi&#x27;s is aggressive in advertising, marketing, and trademark protection. It has used its signature arched stitching on the back pockets of its jeans since 1873. In 1943, the firm trademarked the design in the U.S. and has done so in more than 100 total jurisdictions as of 2019. It has also trademarked various word marks, including &quot;Levi&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Red Tab&quot;, &quot;Orange Tab&quot;, &quot;Silvertab&quot;, &quot;501&quot;, &quot;505&quot;, &quot;517&quot;, &quot;550&quot;, &quot;569&quot;, and &quot;Dockers&quot;. 

During the Cold War, Levi&#x27;s became a symbol of the west in the Soviet Union. According to historian Kristin Roth-Ey, the association stemmed from the 1957 World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow: Americans wore Levi&#x27;s jeans to the event, resulting in widespread interest within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic that prompted the Soviet government to condemn the brand as a symbol of western decadence. Continued demand for the jeans resulted in both genuine articles and bootlegs becoming commonplace in Soviet black markets, and in 1979, the Soviet government struck deals with Levi&#x27;s and the VF Corporation to manufacture jeans for consumers in the region; however, this deal fell through due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott following the onset of the Soviet–Afghan War.

In 2022, it was reported that a pair of Levi&#x27;s jeans from the 1880s found in an abandoned mine shaft was sold for $87,400 at an auction in New Mexico. The vintage Levi&#x27;s bore a label with the inscription &quot;the only kind made by white labor&quot;, a detail which helped date the jeans to the period between 1882, which was after the U.S. Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, banning Chinese laborers seeking to immigrate to the U.S., and the 1890s, when the company &quot;reversed [its] policy and company leaders began speaking out against the nation&#x27;s racist policy&quot;.

==Corporate structure and staff==
Levi Strauss &amp; Co. is a worldwide corporation organized into three geographic divisions: Levi Strauss Americas (LSA), which is headquartered in San Francisco; Levi Strauss Europe (LSE), which is based in Brussels; and Levi Strauss Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa.

Strauss passed the company to his nephews, Jacob, Sigmund, Louis and Abraham, the four surviving sons of David Stern, upon his death in 1902. Walter A. Haas, who married Elise Stern, the daughter of David&#x27;s son, Sigmund Stern, became president in 1928, and the company remained under the ownership of the Stern-Haas family until first going public in 1971. However, in 1985, the Haas family recaptured ownership of the company, taking it private once again for the next 34 years. In February 2019, the company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol LEVI. It was held on March 21, 2019, selling for $17 per share.

The company is also well known for promoting progressive causes. It was one of the earliest private sector institutions to support LGBTQ causes and, during the 2016 presidential campaign, donated $1 million to support immigration and LGBTQ rights. In 2018, CEO Chip Bergh published an op-ed in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, speaking out against gun violence.

However, the company is alleged to make use of Uyghur forced labor provided by the China-based supplier Beijing Guanghua Textile Group from a report by the Helena Kennedy Center for International Justice, the socialists and democrats in the European Parliament. Levi&#x27;s has disputed these claims.

In the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company experienced a 62% drop in sales and recorded a $364 million loss. Some 700 office jobs were pared to reduce expenses by $100 million.

==Current products==
As of 2019, Levi&#x27;s are made in many developing countries, including Bangladesh, India, Egypt, Lesotho, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico. Some top-end styles in the &quot;Levi&#x27;s Premium&quot; and &quot;Levi&#x27;s Vintage Clothing&quot; lines are produced in the United States. 

In addition to jeans, Levi&#x27;s sells a full line of shirts, jackets, sweaters, underwear, socks, eyeglasses, accessories, dresses, skirts, and leather products. All jeans and pants are categorized by fit – skinny, slim, straight, bootcut, taper, relaxed, flare, and &quot;big &amp; tall&quot; – identified by trademarked three-digit numbers. The 501, the company&#x27;s original modern design, is available in styles for both men and women. The rest of the 500 series is designed for men, and the 300, 400, 700, and 800 series for women.

<text>The Red Line is a rapid transit line in Chicago, run by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) as part of the Chicago &quot;L&quot; system. It is the busiest line on the &quot;L&quot; system, with an average of 108,303 passengers boarding each weekday in 2023 The route is long with a total of 33 stations. It runs elevated from the Howard station in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the North Side, through the State Street subway on the Near North Side, Downtown, and the South Loop, and then through the Dan Ryan Expressway median to 95th/Dan Ryan in the Roseland neighborhood on the South Side. 

Like Chicago&#x27;s Blue Line, the Red Line runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, making Chicago, New York City, and Copenhagen the only three cities in the world that operate train service 24 hours a day throughout their city limits. 

The CTA is planning an extension of the Red Line, adding and four new stations which would extend the line from 95th Street to 130th Street, making the Red Line approximately 31 miles in length with 37 stations. In December 2022, the Chicago City Council approved the creation of a district that will send approximately $1 billion in tax revenue for the extension of the Red Line south of 95th Street to 130th Street.

==Route==
===North Side Main Line===

The northern terminus of the Red Line is Howard in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago, on the north side. The Red Line extends southeasterly on an elevated embankment structure about a half-mile (1 kilometer) west of the lakefront to Touhy Avenue then turns south along Glenwood Avenue to Morse station. 

From there the route swings on a sweeping reverse curve to the east to Sheridan Road, adjacent to Loyola University Chicago and continues southerly parallel to Broadway to the east (in Edgewater), and follows Broadway to Leland Avenue. From here, the route transitions from concrete embankment to steel elevated structure. The &quot;L&quot; continues southward running adjacent the Graceland Cemetery, Irving Park Road and Sheffield Avenue from Uptown to Lincoln Park. The Brown Line (Ravenswood), joins the Red Line tracks just north of Belmont.

South of Belmont, Red, Brown and Purple Line Express trains run side-by-side on the four track North Side &quot;L&quot; to Armitage. Red Line trains run on the two middle tracks, only making two stops at Belmont &amp; Fullerton and skipping Wellington, Diversey and Armitage.

Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is served by the Addison station. Additionally, Rate Field, home of the Chicago White Sox, is served by the Sox–35th station.

The North Side Main Line of the Red Line travels from Howard station to Armitage station.

=== State Street subway===

After running through Armitage, the Red Line descends to a portal at Willow Street and enters the subway, turning southeast on Clybourn Avenue, east at Division Street, and south at State Street through the Loop to Roosevelt Road. South of Roosevelt Road, there is a junction, with one pair of tracks curving to the east and leaving the subway at 13th Street and connecting to the old South Side &quot;L&quot; at 18th and State Streets. This section was used from October 1943 until February 1993, when trains from Howard were routed to the Englewood and Jackson Park branches, today known as the south branches of the Green Line. 

The 13th Street portal is now used for non-service train moves and emergency purposes. The 13th Street portal was used again for regular &quot;L&quot; service from May until October 2013, because Red Line trains were rerouted to the Green Line&#x27;s South Side Main Line tracks and terminated at Ashland/63rd during the five months of the Red Line South Reconstruction Project. This service was used again from April to November 2017 and July 2018 to April 2019.

The Red Line is the only Chicago &quot;L&quot; line that connects to all seven other &quot;L&quot; lines full time. The Purple Line shares the distinction only when it runs its weekday rush hour route.

=== Dan Ryan branch===

At 13th Street, the subway swings away from State Street on a reverse curve to the southwest then rises to another portal at 16th Street adjacent Metra&#x27;s Rock Island District line. The Red Line leaves at 16th Street and continues southward on an elevated structure to 24th Street. There is a stop at Cermak–Chinatown on this portion.

South of Cermak Road, the Red Line tracks enter the median strip of the Franklin Street Connector, The Red Line then tunnels beneath the expressway interchange between 28th and 30th Streets and continues the rest of the way to 95th Street in the median of the Dan Ryan Expressway (Interstate 90 &amp; 94). Chicago pioneered using expressway medians for local &quot;L&quot; train lines (the other two being the Eisenhower Expressway and Kennedy Expressways, which both carry portions of the Blue Line). The Red Line follows the Dan Ryan the rest of the way to the 95th Street terminal in Roseland. 

The 98th Yard lies just south and east of the Dan Ryan–Bishop Ford Freeway interchange. Beyond the interchange, the Dan Ryan Expressway and Bishop Ford Freeway both continue towards the south city limits without a transit line in the median strips, but were built with wide grass medians in which future extensions of the rapid transit line remain an option. An extension to 130th Street is in its final planning stages. This extension includes three elevated stations at 103rd, 111th, and Michigan, an at-grade terminal station at 130th.

Stations along the Red Line serve important Chicago landmarks such as Rate Field and the Illinois Institute of Technology (Sox–35th), DePaul University (Fullerton), the Auditorium Building of Roosevelt University (Jackson) and Loyola University Chicago (Loyola), as well as the Magnificent Mile (Grand) and Chinatown (Cermak-Chinatown).

In May 2013, the branch, along with all nine stations, closed for five months to allow the replacement of the tracks and for construction crews to improve the stations on the branch. The newly reconstructed Dan Ryan branch and the nine stations reopened in October 2013.

==Rolling stock==
The Red Line is operated with the Bombardier-built 5000-series railcars. From 2012 until October 2013, the Red Line was operated with the 2400-series cars, during weekday rush hours, and from 1993 until 2015, the Red Line was operated with the 2600-series cars. As the 5000-series cars were delivered, the Red Line&#x27;s 2600-series cars were transferred to other lines to replace the 2400-series cars. From October 2013 until April 2014, several of the Red Line&#x27;s 2600-series cars were transferred over to the Purple Line as they were displaced on the Red Line by the 5000-series cars. 

Beginning in June 2014, CTA began to transfer the 2600-series cars from the Red Line over to the Blue Line due to them being newer than the existing Blue Line cars. The Blue Line&#x27;s older 2600-series cars were transferred to the Orange Line as an interim replacement for its 2400-series cars. Beginning in October 2014, CTA started transferring some of the Red Line&#x27;s 2600-series cars to the Orange Line, replacing the Orange Line&#x27;s remaining 2400-series cars until the Red Line was fully equipped with the 5000-series cars.

==Operating hours and headways==
Like the Blue Line, the Red Line runs 24 hours a day. On weekdays, service runs very frequently at 30 tph (trains per hour) during rush hour, and 8 tph during the midday and nighttime. On Saturdays, 6 tph in the early morning, then increase to 10–11 tph during the day, then 8 tph at night. On Sundays, service runs 6 tph early morning, then increase to 8tph minutes all day into early evening, 6 tph later at night. Between approximately midnight and 5:30 a.m., night owl service on the Red Line ranges between ten and fifteen minutes (4–6 tph).

==History==
The oldest section of the line opened on May 31, 1900, running from the Loop to Wilson. It was constructed by the Northwestern Elevated Railroad. The route was extended to Central Street in Evanston on May 16, 1908, via leased and electrified trackage belonging to the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. In November 1913, the North Side &quot;L&quot; was through routed with the South Side &quot;L&quot; lines through the Loop. The ground-level section between Leland Avenue and Howard Street was elevated on a concrete embankment structure and widened to four tracks in 1922.

The State Street subway opened on October 17, 1943, providing two new tracks bypassing the Loop tracks and the portion of the North and South Side &quot;L&quot; lines not equipped with express tracks. By providing an express route free of the most restrictive curves on the Chicago &quot;L&quot; and shorter than the old line it supplemented, the subway reduced running time by as much as eleven minutes for a one-way trip. The route was placed in operation on October 17, 1943, for a portion of the through north–south trains, although other trains continued to use the &quot;L&quot; both on through trips and on services circling the Loop and returning to the point of origin.

In August 1949, the North–South route was revised to create a more efficient routing through the Central Business District and handle the heavy volumes of passenger traffic using it. The Howard branch was paired with the Englewood and Jackson Park branches through the State Street subway, using the 13th Street portal and the other lines routed to the Loop &quot;L&quot;.

The Dan Ryan Branch opened in September 1969, and was paired with the Lake Street branch to form the West-South route, almost universally referred to as the Lake–Dan Ryan route. It operated over the Lake Street and Wabash Avenue sides of the Union Loop. This &quot;interim&quot; service was created mainly for the purpose of providing through service between the west side and the south side in anticipation of the 1968 Loop Subway Project. When the controversial subway project was cancelled in 1979, the Lake-Dan Ryan service remained and lasted for 24 years.

For much of the 20th century, the Howard–Englewood/Jackson Park route was equally compatible in terms of passenger service until the late 1960s through the 1970s. However, passenger traffic volumes began to shift on the south side lines, with more riders using the newer Dan Ryan line (which runs four miles (6 km) further south) and fewer riders on the older &quot;L&quot; lines. This level of ridership allowed the CTA to develop a more efficient system by combining the more heavily used rail lines together and combining the other lines together, providing increased service capacity for the routes that need it. The Red Line was created in 1993, when the CTA adopted color-coded system for all of its &quot;L&quot; routes. 

In February 1993, a new connection opened from the State Street subway south of Roosevelt to Cermak–Chinatown. The Howard branch was paired with the Dan Ryan branch creating the current Red Line and the Lake Street branch was paired with the Englewood and Jackson Park branches to form the Green Line. A further operational benefit of this switch was that this freed up capacity in the Loop needed for the addition of the Orange Line to Midway Airport. The former tracks used to move West-South trains from the Loop to the Dan Ryan line are still retained for non-revenue moves and service disruptions.

The Dan Ryan Branch of the Red Line underwent a rehabilitation period to improve its aging infrastructure which ended in early 2007. This work included upgrading the power and signal systems, and rehabilitating the stations with improved lighting, a cleaner appearance, and new escalators and elevators. The CTA has plans to expand Red Line service to ten car trains from the current eight-car trains.

===Red Ahead rehabilitation===

In spring 2012, the CTA started a station and track rehabilitation program dubbed &quot;Red Ahead&quot;, beginning on the North Side Main Line, which is called the &quot;Red North&quot; project. The program monitors the full route of the Red Line, excluding the Loyola, Bryn Mawr, Sheridan, or Wilson station. This also does not include stations between Wilson through Fullerton, nor the State Street subway. In May 2012, the CTA started to work on the North Side Main Line stations of the Red Line which includes Jarvis, Morse, Granville, Thorndale, Berwyn, Argyle and Lawrence. The stations are listed in order, starting at Granville, then Morse, Thorndale, Argyle, Berwyn, Lawrence and finally Jarvis. This project started in June 2012 and was completed in December 2012. This project is also part of the Red Ahead&#x27;s &quot;Red &amp; Purple Modernization&quot; Project.

The Red &amp; Purple Modernization Project will include a redesign of a diamond junction north of Belmont Station into a flyover for Brown Line trains. This project will decrease train backups and increase the number of trains that can cross the junction per hour. The project was criticized by 2015 mayoral candidate Chuy García and local residents in the Lakeview neighborhood who organized a referendum to stop it. The Federal Transit Administration passed the CTA&#x27;s environmental review on the flyover in January 2016 and received a $1.1 billion federal grant the following year. 16 properties affected by the flyover were demolished. Construction began on October 2, 2019, and the flyover entered service on November 19, 2021.

==Proposed extension==
, proposals have been underway to extend the Red Line south from 95th Street. The CTA developed nine different proposed routes, one of which includes routing the Red Line down the median of the Bishop Ford Freeway and another in the median of Interstate 57. During an alternatives analysis meeting on April 11, 2007, CTA narrowed further study down to five possible routes, two for bus rapid transit and three for heavy rail (rapid) transit. The two bus routes would travel south from the 95th/Dan Ryan terminal either down Halsted Street or Michigan Avenue, while the heavy rail routes left for consideration were the Halsted and Michigan corridors (either underground or elevated) as well as the Union Pacific Railroad corridor (elevated or trench), which would traverse southeastward toward the South Shore Line. In October 2008, the CTA commissioned a $150,000 study of an extension south from 95th Street to 130th Street in the community area of Riverdale.

In December 2008, at the Screen 2 presentation of the federally mandated Alternatives Analysis Study, the possible corridors and modes of transit were furthered narrowed down to either Halsted Street (bus rapid transit or elevated Heavy Rail Transit) and the Union Pacific Railroad corridor (elevated Heavy Rail Transit).

In December 2009, the CTA identified the locally preferred alternative as the Union Pacific corridor. A map and description of the route are found at TransitChicago.com. Multiple Environmental Impact Studies will be carried out, and will determine exact alignments and design.

The alignment consists of a new elevated rail line between 95th/Dan Ryan and a new terminal station at 130th Street, paralleling the Union Pacific Railroad and the South Shore Line, through the Far South Side neighborhoods of Roseland, Washington Heights, West Pullman, and Riverdale. In addition to the terminal station at 130th, three new stations would be built at 103rd, 111th, and Michigan, and a new yard and shop would be built at 120th Street. Basic engineering, along with an environmental impact statement, were underway by 2010.

In August 2024, the CTA awarded a $2.3 billion construction contract to Walsh-VINCI Transit Community Partners for the 4-stop extension, with a total project cost (including financing) of $5.3 billion. Construction was expected by the CTA to last from late 2025 to 2030.

==Station listing==
==Rail yards==
There are two rail yards for the Red Line cars: Howard Yard, for the northern portion of the line and the 98th Yard for the southern portion of the line. Another yard, the 120th Yard has been proposed as part of the Red Line extension.

<text>Spider-Girl (May &quot;Mayday&quot; Parker) is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She has been referred to as both Spider-Girl and Spider-Woman. The character appears in the MC2 universe. The character was created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz as the teenage daughter of Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Mary Jane Watson, and first appeared in &quot;What If&quot; #105 (February 1998). She later acquired her own ongoing comic book, &quot;Spider-Girl&quot;, written by DeFalco and drawn by Frenz and Pat Olliffe, which was the longest-running superhero book with a lead female character ever published by Marvel. The title was relaunched as &quot;The Amazing Spider-Girl&quot;, and later &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot;.

The character made her cinematic debut in the 2023 feature film &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;, with an infant Mayday depicted as the daughter of Peter B. Parker and his universe&#x27;s Mary Jane Watson.

==Publication history==
Spider-Girl first appeared in a one-shot story in the ongoing series &quot;What If&quot;. Following positive fan response to the concept, &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; and two other series (&quot;A-Next&quot; and &quot;J2&quot;) set in the same alternate future universe were launched under the MC2 imprint. Although each of these titles were slated to be 12-issue limited series, &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; initial sales justified their continuation as ongoing titles.

After initial interest, &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; drew low sales. The book&#x27;s active fan base convinced Marvel to revoke several cancellation announcements. Reprints of the series in digest size trade paperbacks sold well. Marvel Associate Editor Nick Lowe revealed in a Nov. 2005 interview that &quot;&quot;Spider-Girl&quot;, for the first time, is completely safe from cancellation.&quot;

Despite Lowe&#x27;s statement, Marvel announced that No. 100 would be the title&#x27;s final issue. The book was relaunched as &quot;The Amazing Spider-Girl&quot;, with issue #0 appearing in Oct. 2006.

On October 11, 2008, Tom DeFalco announced that &quot;The Amazing Spider-Girl&quot; would be canceled with issue #30, though he revealed that, due to the company&#x27;s love for the character, she could possibly be given a sixteen-page back-up strip in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot;. On November 8, 2008, Marvel EIC Joe Quesada confirmed that Spider-Girl would become a feature in the monthly anthology magazine &quot;Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot;. The series would replace the feature &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man&quot;, written by DeFalco, which served as a prequel series to the Spider-Girl universe.

On March 18, 2009, Marvel announced that Spider-Girl would continue publication as &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot;, a web-comic released through Marvel&#x27;s Digital Comics Unlimited. The title would continue to be simultaneously published in paper form within &quot;Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot;. &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot; #5 (published April 2009) through No. 8 (July 2009) contained these Spider-Girl stories until the title&#x27;s cancellation with issue #8.

The new &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot; stories were then contained in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot;. This lasted for seven issues before being moved to its own four-issue limited series, &quot;Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot;, which tied up most of the series plot threads. This was followed by one last Spider girl tale, &quot;Spider-Girl: The End&quot;.

In November 2010, a new &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; series was launched that was unconnected to the MC2 universe. The MC2 Spider-Girl title was cancelled, having surpassed publisher expectations for longevity. The new series featured a new character, Anya Corazon, whose adventures occurred on Earth 616. The series was canceled after only eight issues. No official reason was given for the cancellation. This character returned for a &quot;Spider Island&quot; limited series.

Mayday and her family were reintroduced, as part of the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; crossover event, in the eighth issue of the third volume of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, which was the first story with Mayday to be written by Dan Slott, the first time a fully-grown Mayday appeared in the pages of her father&#x27;s flagship title, and the first story to highlight the &quot;Spider-Marriage&quot; in the regular comics since 2007&#x27;s controversial &quot;One More Day&quot;.

She appeared again, handled by the original creative team, in July 2015 as part of Marvel&#x27;s Secret Wars event, serving as a backup story in Christos Gage&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Island&quot;. She also returned for the sequel event to &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;. Shortly after her father reunited with her family, Mayday reverted back to her original Spider-Girl codename. In November 2022, a new serialized adventure starring Mayday was launched on the Marvel Unlimited Infinity Comics app, with the story penned by Stephanie Williams.

==Fictional character biography==
May &quot;Mayday&quot; Parker is the daughter of Peter and Mary Jane Parker and the great-niece of Aunt May in the future, alternate universe continuity. Peter and Mary Jane named their daughter after his Aunt May. In the MC2 continuity, they were reunited with their baby girl by Kaine, who found the child living with Alison Mongraine, the con artist who had kidnapped the baby on instruction from the Green Goblin. After they were reunited, Peter lost a leg during the horrific final conflict with the Green Goblin. After the battle Peter was offered a bionic replacement from Mister Fantastic but, considering it a wake-up call, decided to retire and focus on being a husband and father (the battle is glimpsed in &quot;Spider Girl&quot; #7, and fully explained in &quot;Spider Girl&quot; #49). For years, they chose to keep their past from May and hoped that she wouldn&#x27;t develop powers of her own.

Despite her parents&#x27; hopes, May began developing versions of her father&#x27;s spider-powers when she was 15. At the same time, Normie Osborn, grandson of the original Green Goblin, set out to restore the family name. May donned Ben Reilly&#x27;s Spider-Man costume to stop him and soon took to crime-fighting, at first hindered, then helped, by her worried real parents.

May shares traits of both of her parents. Like her mother, she is a beautiful, charismatic, and a popular student in her high school, and she is intelligent and talented just like her father. She also inherited his love for in-fight bantering and his intolerance for injustice. Even without her spider powers, she is a very good athlete and excelled in her girls&#x27; basketball team until she quit, her resignation coming after the manifestation of her powers. On the one hand, May seems to have inherited the &quot;Parker luck&quot; in which her dual identity wreaks havoc in her private life. On the other hand, her superhero career, unlike her father&#x27;s, begins with her successfully protecting her family. From the early part of her career onward, Spider-Girl has developed a reputation for avoiding unnecessary battles with anyone and reforming her former adversaries, like Normie Osborn and Raptor. Spider-Girl quickly establishes herself in the superhero community and gets along with other superheroes easily, gaining reserve status in the Avengers and allies in the New Warriors and Fantastic Five.

In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Girl,&quot; May promises to give up costumed super-heroics, dates Eugene Thompson, and runs for student council. When Mary Jane becomes aware that the Hobgoblin poses a threat to her goddaughter&#x27;s teenage friends, she allows May to resume her activities as Spider-Girl (a situation they wanted to keep secret from Peter). After a battle with the Hobgoblin, May tells her godfather the truth, and after a conversation with Mary Jane, they allowed May to resume her Spider-Girl identity. After Mary Jane has an argument with May&#x27;s real parents, she realizes that May will come to the truth about Peter someday but Peter planned it all along. Because of this action, she continues her fight to keep the city safe.

After an attempt at helping the S.H.I.E.L.D. government agency, a case filled with a piece of the Carnage symbiote was released. It attaches itself to May&#x27;s friend Moose, who becomes the new Carnage. In exchange, Carnage will bond itself to Moose&#x27;s terminally ill father, curing him in the process. Carnage causes a stir at May&#x27;s school and kidnaps Peter and Baby Ben, forcing May to confront her friend. May tries to talk to Moose within the symbiote but fails, and it bonds with her cousin Ben. Peter escapes as May battles the two symbiotes and gathers sonic gear that may be able to defeat the symbiote. However, it is May who uses the weapons, thereby destroying the piece of the Carnage symbiote. Her success is not without a measure of collateral damage: not only is Moose furious at Spider-Girl for dooming his father, but the sonic weapon renders Ben deaf.

Ben&#x27;s hearing is eventually restored thanks to the intervention of Normie Osborn. Normie later stumbles on one of Norman Osborn&#x27;s former labs and discovers a fluid tank containing what appears to be a physical duplicate of May Parker. Notes left behind by his grandfather indicate that this Mayday is the original he kidnapped years ago, hinting that the Mayday raised by Peter and MJ is yet another clone.

Fury the Goblin Queen begins acting out the Green Goblin&#x27;s final gambit against Peter Parker. While kidnapping the retired Spider-Man, Fury also activates a signal that awakens the unconscious girl within the Osborn labs&#x27; tank. The changeling escapes, confronting Mayday on the roof of her high school just as she is changing into Spider-Girl. The two briefly battle before being caught in an explosion. A critically injured May is rescued from the debris by Araña&#x27;s forces. Araña is suddenly traumatized by her own ordeal, and, thinking that May might not survive her ordeal, offers to merge with her. However, she intervenes in a vision quest that Mayday is undergoing. By aiding her to overcome a force she was meant to overcome alone, she obstructs Spider-Girl from uncovering whether or not she is the true May; mainly because May is half Latina on her father&#x27;s side and Araña is only going by the trauma she went through not thinking of what could happen to May and her school. Araña also has an ulterior motive: by assuming the body and power of Spider-Girl she hopes to take the Black Tarantula, an adversary and former lover, by surprise and defeat him. Araña successfully completes the merger and temporarily assumes control of May&#x27;s body, leaving May and a third, blond woman who shares her name (later revealed to be the spirit of Aunt May) trapped within Araña&#x27;s body.

Meanwhile, the changeling emerges from the blast relatively unharmed and attempts to resume May&#x27;s life. However, her presence deeply disturbs Benjy. She later receives a call from Normie, telling her about the capture of Peter Parker, leading the changeling into taking on the role of Spider-Girl.

The two women are restored to their rightful bodies while in battle with others. May, in Araña&#x27;s body, runs into the changeling just as Araña, in May&#x27;s body, enters the lair of the Black Tarantula. The Black Tarantula is able to see through Araña&#x27;s trick and nearly knocks her unconscious, just as May, in Araña&#x27;s body, is knocked unconscious as well, leading the two of them to recover their original bodies.

Normie Osborne, along with Kaine, Phil Urich (in his Green Goblin Costume), Darkdevil, and Raptor, tries to rescue Peter Parker from Fury&#x27;s hands, unaware of the fact that Peter has absorbed the mind and memories of the original Norman Osborn. This leads to a fight between the assembled heroes and Peter, now possessed by the Green Goblin. May arrives just as Peter/Green Goblin reunites with the changeling, who is revealed to have been genetically spliced with the DNA of the Venom symbiote, giving her similar metamorphic powers displayed by Spidercide, but without the need for a host like normal symbiotes.

Bonding with his &quot;daughter&quot; (and, unintentionally, Spider-Girl), the possessed Peter declares himself as &quot;The Goblin God&quot; and begins to go on a rampage, while May finds herself trapped within her father&#x27;s mental psyche. With the aid of the spiritual influence of her Great Aunt May Parker, as well as flashbacks to the day she healed Normie Osborn&#x27;s psychological scars, Mayday and Peter are able to overcome Norman in a psychic duel and convince the Brand New May that May is a good person (but May tries to attack the changeling). Norman is seemingly defeated, but not before he denies Mayday the chance to discover whenever or not she is the true daughter of Peter and Mary Jane or the clone. Mary Jane is rescued from near-death by Benjy, who reveals he has developed organic webbing.

With the Brand New May uncertain of her place, May proposes she become a member of the Parker family; Mary Jane agrees, though Peter distrusts her and objects to the idea. May takes a walk, reflecting on how her parents, baby brother, and potential new twin sister have overcome so much and truly become &quot;An Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot;.

The following story-line sees Mayday and her clone (now named April) begin to steadily grow as crime-fighting partners, with April proving at times to be unstable and far more intense and ruthless than her &quot;cousin&quot; Mayday. At one point, April murders Tombstone when she believes him to have murdered May.

In the meantime, whilst trying to control the rising gang warfare in New York City as well as keep her unruly cousin in line with both her temper and powers, Mayday&#x27;s relationship with comic book artist and friend Wesley begins to blossom into a deeper bond, and Wes at times demonstrates hints that he knows May&#x27;s identity. April briefly attempts to play mischievous match-maker with the pair by posing as May, but Wes sees through her deception. April eventually takes on the name &quot;Mayhem&quot; and embraces her symbiotic, intense, no-nonsense nature and cuts herself off from The Parker family to pursue a life as a vigilante who answers to no one.

&quot;The Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot; title concludes with May having a nightmare that she sacrificed herself to save April&#x27;s life. However, in the far future, a future incarnation of April uses Doctor Doom&#x27;s time machine to return to the present and convince her past self to act responsibly, she does and saves Mayday&#x27;s life at the cost of her own and at the cost of the future that came to be. May is later united with Wes, who reveals that he does indeed know May&#x27;s true identity and they kiss, beginning a relationship.

In the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, Daemos, a member of the Inheritors and a relative of Morlun, attacked the Parker home and set it ablaze. Despite Wes&#x27; best efforts to help her, May is badly beaten. Peter, whose bionic leg is busted, frees May only to be caught in Daemos&#x27; grasp. Mary Jane hands baby Ben to May and tells her to run while she goes to help Peter. Daemos kills Peter and seemingly Mary Jane too. Two alternate universe Spider-Men consisting of Spider-UK and Last Stand Spider-Man appear in time to save May and Ben as Daemos emerges from the Parker home. May vows to avenge her family for what he has done.

May and the alternative Spiders later travel to Earth-616, where they recruit its version of Peter Parker alongside his most recent partner Silk and his clone Kaine. May reveals her identity to Peter, revealing that they have met before earlier in his timeline (when she travelled back in time to the events of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #25). The Spiders take the three to a safe zone where they eventually also come into contact with a team led by the &quot;Superior Spider-Man&quot; Otto Octavius. When Peter and Octavius clash and do battle with each other, Mayday requests that Captain Universe Spider-Man intervene and stop the fighting, as better time and energy could be spent tracking down the Inheritors, but the Cosmic Spider refuses. Peter eventually wins the fight. The safe zone is then compromised by The Inheritors, led by their father Solus, Cosmic Spider is killed, May is easily defeated, and can only look on helplessly as Baby Benjy is captured, and it is revealed that he is &quot;The Scion&quot;, a vital part of a prophecy that also involves &quot;The Other&quot; (Kaine) and &quot;The Bride&quot; (Silk) Despite her earlier vow to kill the Inheritors, after seeing Otto kill the Inheritors&#x27; &#x27;Master Weaver&#x27; to stop their plans for good, May reconsiders her stance, avoiding destroying a crystal containing the life-essence of the Inheritors&#x27; &#x27;father&#x27;. With the crisis concluded, Spider-Ham assures May that, if her father was anything like him, he would be proud of what she just did, May accepting the compliment despite Spider-Ham&#x27;s comical appearance. Returning to her world with the Ben Parker of Earth-3145—a world where Ben became Spider-Man and his family were killed, resulting in Earth being decimated by a nuclear apocalypse—May learns that her mother and Wes survived the Inheritors&#x27; attack, although her father gave his life to save them. With Ben deciding to remain on this world to be the grandfather no other Ben Parker had the chance to become, May, on her mother&#x27;s encouragement, decides to don her father&#x27;s costume to become Spider-&quot;Woman&quot;.

Following the events of Secret Wars, the MC2 universe, along with most of the multiverse, is destroyed and is merged with several other alternate realities by God Emperor Doom into the patchwork planet called Battleworld. Mayday continues to protect the innocent as Spider-Woman, but still struggles to come to terms with her father&#x27;s death. Many citizens still refer to her as Spider-Girl. However, after a battle against the Revengers, she donned a new costume and gained renewed hope for the future.

===Warriors of the Great Web===
Sometime within the eight months following the Incursions, Mayday joined Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-UK, Spider-Man India, Spider-Ham and Anya Corazon in protecting Earths without Spider-Men. After a romp on Earth-3015, Mayday confided to Gwen that she was still too concerned in leaving behind her mom and brother and told them to call her if they needed her. However, when an army of Electros attacked a nearby building in an attempt to steal silver, the two Spider-Women jumped into action, only for Gwen to get captured when Mayday attempted to rally the other Spiders. She then returned to Loomworld and informed Spider-Man (Paviitr Prabhakar), Spider-Ham (Peter Porker), and Karn of the situation regarding Gwen&#x27;s kidnapping. She was later seen alongside the other members of the Warriors of the Great Web in order to investigate the scene of Gwen&#x27;s kidnapping.

===&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; and &quot;Spider-Girls&quot;===
In the 2018 comics event &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; and the spin-off mini-series &quot;Spider-Girls&quot;, Mayday is once again recruited to help the Web Warriors combat The Inheritors, who had managed to escape their confinement and had set up residence on Earth 616. Mayday and Anya are sent to the world of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot; to recruit Annie May Parker, the second child Peter and MJ conceived after their version of Mayday died at birth.

With Annie&#x27;s parents assisting the war effort against The Inheritors on Earth 616, Mayday and Anya try to help Annie unlock the mysteries of the Spider-Scrolls and find a means of stopping their enemies. Annie learns that she is the pattern weaver, the fourth Spider involved in the prophecy alongside Mayday&#x27;s brother Benjy (The Scion), Silk (The Bride), and The Other. After battling two of the Inheritors on Annie&#x27;s world, Mayday, Anya and Annie retreat to Loomworld where they find the web of destiny has been sabotaged. They then use the scrolls to return to Earth 616 and use Annie&#x27;s web-weaving powers to help the web warriors defeat the Inheritors and their leader Solos. Afterwards, it is revealed that The Other has resurrected Mayday&#x27;s father back on her own world

===&quot;End of the Spider-Verse&quot; and Return of Normalcy===
In the &quot;End of the Spider-Verse&quot; event, Mayday at some unspecified point is attacked and infected by one of the many Spider-Wasps unleashed on the multiverse by the demonic Shathra, turning her against the other warriors of the web., her father is one of Shathra&#x27;s prisoners, The Other having transformed him into a savage Spider-Beast. The Other, with the aid of Spinneret and other heroes, helps to free the Spiders from Shathra&#x27;s control and he and Mayday are finally reunited. Ultimately, it is the 616 variant of Arana who helps restore Mayday&#x27;s father to normal using her mystic totem powers.

Shortly after this ordeal, Mayday settles back into her regular life, allowing her hair to grow longer again and reverting back to her original Spider-Girl codename. No longer dating Wes, Mayday began to flirt with a new student called Jason, and aided both pairs of Lady Hawks thwart a nearby crime. With her parents reconnecting on date nights, Mayday would babysit her brother Benjy, now having grown into a tyke and able to speak.

Mayday and her family meet Bailey Briggs, a.k.a. Spider-Boy, when he arrives in their universe after becoming unstuck through time and space. Mayday&#x27;s parents offer him breakfast, and it is revealed Peter has returned to active duty as Spider-Man, a fully healthy leg restored to his body, removing his long-standing handicap. Mayday offers Bailey the use of her old web warrior equipment to contact Anya but Bailey vanishes as he is again pulled through the multiverse.

==Powers and abilities==
May Parker inherited many of her abilities from her father, Peter Parker. May possesses superhuman strength but has less than her father, can leap several stories high, and can cover the width of a city block. Spider-Girl&#x27;s reflexes are also heightened to levels well beyond that of an ordinary human. She heals somewhat faster than a normal human, and is more agile than Spider-Man.

Spider-Girl can adhere to almost any surface through a bio-magnetic field her body generates, allowing her to scale the sides of a building, just like a spider. Wall-crawling doesn&#x27;t come as naturally to May as Peter; she has to concentrate to keep herself from slipping off surfaces. In addition to adhering to surfaces, May can also repel herself like an opposing magnet, or she can repulse and adhere another object or person through a shared medium. For example, she can cause a person to stick to a wall they&#x27;re touching just by touching that same wall and willing them to, or she can just as easily violently push them away.

May Parker has inherited a &quot;spider-sense&quot;, a clairvoyance that warns her of danger, that is somewhat more powerful and reliable than her father&#x27;s. It tells her the direction a threat is coming from with a high level of accuracy. Through intensive training, she learned to fight blindfolded using only her spider-sense. She can use it to spot weaknesses in an opponent and use them to her advantage. She can also sense mundane threats or observations like her father, but unlike him, she can use it to sense deception. Her spider-sense is also capable of differentiating between various threats, allowing May to &quot;recognize&quot; a familiar danger. By touching her father&#x27;s clone, Kaine, she experienced a shared precognitive vision, but she does not normally have that ability.

May also has mechanical web-shooters based which are on Ben Reilly&#x27;s web-shooter design, but longer and narrower. They can fire impact webbing and metal needles called &quot;Stingers&quot;. May rarely uses the stingers, thinking them to be &quot;too brutal&quot;. Her mobile phone is modified to attach to one of her web-shooters, and looks like one of its cartridges. She occasionally uses spider-tracers, but as they are tuned to her father&#x27;s spider-sense and not hers, she needs a receiver to detect them. She wears a skin tight spandex unitard which she was uncomfortable with at first because of its revealing characteristics but has grown accustomed to it and even enjoys wearing it as she has been quoted as saying &quot;it feels like a second skin.&quot;

Spider-Girl once lost her powers due to an electric shock. However, she borrowed the Green Goblin equipment from Normie Osborn until she regained them.

May has also received martial arts training from the Ladyhawks and Elektra Natchios, as well as being drilled in the use of her powers by her father.

==Cast==
===Main cast===
* Peter Parker – Peter is May and Ben&#x27;s father, who happens to be Spider-Man but has retired from superhero business. His last battle cost him one of his legs, and he is now working as a police scientist. He also despises May&#x27;s former boyfriend Gene, because he is the son of his high school bully, Flash Thompson. He has returned to the role of Spider-Man on occasion, although his artificial leg limits his activities. During the Spider-Verse event he dies at the hand of Daemos while giving May and Ben a chance to escape. In the end of Spider-Geddon, &quot;The Other&quot; resurrects him. The resurrection gives Peter a new leg, removing his long-standing handicap and allowing him to become Spider-Man regularly once again 
* Mary Jane Watson-Parker – Mary Jane Watson-Parker is May and Ben&#x27;s mother. Sharp-witted and responsible, Mary Jane knows her superhero husband and daughter inside and out.
* Phil Urich – Phil is the former Green Goblin (the only hero to use that name in this universe) and a good friend of the Parker family. He has been a friend of the family for so long that May calls him &quot;Uncle Phil.&quot; Phil works with Peter Parker at his job in the crime lab. Occasionally, he uses his Goblin powers to help May, at one point taking on the identity of the &quot;Golden Goblin&quot;. Later, with the assistance of Norman Osborn, Phil was able to come out of retirement and take on the identity of the Green Goblin again.
* Benjamin Richard Parker – Benjamin is May&#x27;s beloved little brother, who has shown signs of developing spider-powers despite his young age. Ben was exposed to the Carnage symbiote, which may have sparked the development of his abilities. Ben was briefly rendered deaf due to high-frequency sonics, but eventually recovered. He later gained full-blown spider powers: however, despite Peter&#x27;s suspicions, no one saw him using his abilities. Ben is affectionately nicknamed &quot;Benjy&quot; by his sister and was named after Uncle Ben and his grandfather Richard Parker. Recent years have seen Benjy undergo a growth spurt and he is now a young tyke who has learned to talk. He has developed a weariness of his father&#x27;s wheatcake servings. 
* April Parker – April is a clone of May Parker, but she is unique in that she is also a Symbiote Hybrid, giving her both the powers of Spider-Girl and Venom. Taking the name &quot;Mayhem&quot;, April became a vigilante, and was not above killing criminals; at one point, she tried to end a gang war by killing Black Tarantula, a friend of May&#x27;s, and she later succeeded in ending the war by killing Hobgoblin. April died saving May from an exploding building, but Peter assures to May that clones always come back, so she may have survived.

===Supporting cast===
* Darkdevil – Reilly Tyne is a mocking Puck-like superhero who constantly taunts Spider-Girl for her various weaknesses, but has also proven to be a valuable ally. Although May&#x27;s cousin (although some could call him her genetic half-brother), people mistook him for the currently-deceased Daredevil.
* Gerry Drew – He&#x27;s the son of Jessica Drew, the first Spider-Woman. He has spider-powers because of his mother and he has an illness because of her radiation exposure. He once impersonated Spider-Man, but later retires from this alter-ego.
* Courtney Duran – Courtney is May&#x27;s friend in school. She is a level-headed and bespectacled &quot;Miss Normal&quot; who is in her Science Club, and volunteers in the community along with May.
* Ladyhawk (Rosetta Morgan and Regina Morgan) is the shared codename skilled martial artist sisters that use bird-themed shuriken and other weapons.
* Heather Noble – Heather is one of May&#x27;s schoolmates. At first, she acted mean and stuck up towards May, but has since become her friend. She has been dating Jimmy Yama. Heather is later kidnapped by the Hobgoblin but fortunately Spider-Girl rescues her.
* Simone Desantos – Introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Girl&quot; series, Simone seems to have taken Heather&#x27;s former position as the stuck-up &quot;mean girl&quot; of May&#x27;s school. Her father Rene turns out to be the head of the Goblin Cult, and this once led to Fury kidnapping Simone.
* Felicity Hardy – Felicity is the daughter of Felicia Hardy and Flash Thompson as well as the younger sister of Gene Thompson. She knows that May is Spider-Girl and adopted the costume of Scarlet Spider when May took a break from superhero business. However, she abandoned it quickly and helps May in her civilian identity.
* Sara Hingle – Sara is a mutant with either telekinetic or atomic powers. She had trouble accepting her gifts until May and Mary Jane talked to her. After seeing May nimbly dodge one of her energy blasts, Sara believes that she is a mutant too. She was recently attacked by the anti-mutant group Humanity First, only to be saved by a pair of anti-human mutants, Impact and Pirouette, who convince her to join their crusade. She later takes on the costumed identity of Nucleus, and battles Spider-Girl. When she discovers that Impact and Pirouette are led by Magneta, she flees the group in terror. Later, she attacks Humanity First&#x27;s headquarters. Spider-Girl arrives, and manages to talk her down. Magneta then activates a device that sends Sarah&#x27;s powers out of control, resulting in a huge explosion.
* Jack Jameson – Jack Jameson, also called &quot;JJ&quot;, is the grandson of J. Jonah Jameson, and he is secretly the superhero called The Buzz.
* Kaine – Kaine is very protective of Spider-Girl (his niece, and ultimately the source of his redemption). He currently leads a government team of reformed supervillains.
* Davida Kirby – Davida is May&#x27;s best friend in school and teammate on her basketball team.
* Nancy Lu – Nancy a schoolmate of May who is a mutant with telekinetic powers; she was outed by her classmates, and had to leave the high school. She is an X-Man in-training known as &quot;Push&quot;.
* Maurice &quot;Moose&quot; Mansfield – Maurice is a burly footballer who constantly clashes with Jimmy Yama. On a field trip, he witnessed Spider-Girl running out of a toilet in which Courtney had been, and from then on, thought Courtney was Spider-Girl. He has recently moved away to live with his uncle while his father is in the hospital. When he was bonded with the Carnage symbiote, he attempted to use its power to cure his father&#x27;s cancer. When Spider-Girl used Reverb&#x27;s sonic weaponry to destroy the symbiote, Moose was enraged that his only chance to help his father was destroyed.
* Brad Miller – Brad is a good-looking, smart teenager and May&#x27;s secret crush. She dropped him when she found out he had a hatred for mutants.
* Normie Osborn – Normie is the grandson of Norman Osborn and was this universe&#x27;s Green Goblin until he ceded that role to Phil Urich. He is both a former enemy and former crush of May&#x27;s. In recent issues, he had obtained the Venom-symbiote for his own use until it died in the final battle against Hobgoblin and the Scriers. After the final battle, he married Brenda Drago (Raptor). He still has feelings for May.
* Eugene &quot;Flash&quot; Thompson – Flash is the coach of the basketball team at May&#x27;s school. He was once married to Felicia Hardy and had a daughter Felicity and a son Gene with her (see above and below), but is unaware that Felicity tried to be May&#x27;s partner in the hero business. A noticeable difference between this Flash Thompson and his Earth-616 counterpart is that he never lost his legs, and as a result never became the host of the Venom symbiote.
* Eugene &quot;Gene&quot; Thompson – Gene is the son of Felicia Hardy and Flash Thompson, and the older brother of Felicity Hardy. He was dating May, but broke up with her in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Girl&quot; #13, citing her constant unreliability. Missing her almost immediately, Gene asked Mayday to return to him, with Mayday agreeing. However, his dominating personality and demands for full commitment have placed a strain on Mayday&#x27;s personal and social life. After beating up Wes Westin, and revealing that he was the one tagging May&#x27;s campaign posters, May breaks up with him.
* James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Yama – Jimmy is a nerdy Asian schoolmate of May who is in her Science Club. He has a crush on May, a fact that makes May—who likes Jimmy as a friend, but not more–embarrassed. He has since started dating Heather Noble. He has a cousin named Zane, who happens to be the superhero J2, the son of the Juggernaut.
* Wes Westin – Wes is a talented artist, who has collaborated with Jimmy Yama in producing a Spider-Girl comic. He began a short relationship with Davida Kirby, but Davida begins to suspect his true feelings are for Mayday and encourages him to tell her how he feels. He later found out Spider-Girl&#x27;s true identity by noticing the same scented shampoo. In the finale, he reveals to May that he knows her secret and they begin a relationship. Despite being there for Mayday to help her grieve the death of her father, it appears that in recent years the two have since broken up and his whereabouts are presently unknown.
* Mad Dog Rassitano – Human bounty hunter who uses equipment taken from the super-powered villains he hunts. He has his own TV show.

===Villains===
* Black Tarantula – Fabian LaMuerto is the current Kingpin of Crime. An honorable villain, he is a recurring foe, occasional ally, and possible love-interest for May. In &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot; #4, he decided to retire from crime and return to South America with Arana as his bride. He left his empire to Man Mountain Marko.
** Chesbro – Chesbro is the assistant of the Black Tarantula. He comes to New York to represent his master. Chesbro originally served Fabian&#x27;s father.
* Dragon King – Carlton T. Hackmutter is a janitor at Midtown High School who came across a Dragon Medallion that transformed him into the Dragon King.
* Hobgoblin – Roderick Kingsley, an old foe of Spider-Man&#x27;s who now serves as May&#x27;s archenemy. Fearing that Kingsley would prove too much for May, Peter risked his life and once again became Spider-Man despite his handicap to aid her against him. After losing, Kingsley then tried his hand at other crimes only leading to his death at the hands of Mayhem.
* Killerwatt – Originally a backstage hand during concerts, the man now known as Killerwatt, was often blamed by the performing band for malfunctioning electrical equipment, until he was electrocuted by a sound board. He gained electrical based powers and set out to become a costumed thief, defeating Spider-Girl during their first battle, only to be driven off by Darkdevil. Soon after, Spider-Girl was able to defeat him in later battles.
* Mr. Abnormal – The identity of Mr. Abnormal was unknown. When he had entered a toy company, a plastic vat exploded where he was exposed to its chemicals and ended up gaining elastic-based powers.
* Raptor – Brenda Drago is the daughter of the second Vulture. Spider-Girl later convinced her to give up crime. She is a member of Kaine&#x27;s superteam of reformed supervillains and was recently married to Normie Osborn.
* Sabreclaw – The son of Wolverine and the half-brother of Wild Thing. He has powers like his father and Sabretooth. He has recently joined the A-Next as a hero.
* Mister Nobody – The teleporting mob hitman wore a featureless black mask to hide his identity while acting as a personal bagman and assassin for the imprisoned Kingpin of Crime, Wilson Fisk. Mister Nobody was featured in &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; #1 and would frequently fight her throughout the first half of the series. Up until he was fired, before returning under suspicious circumstances to assassinate Wilson Fisk allowing for a new Kingpin.

==Other versions==
===Prime Earth (Earth-616)===
May Parker also existed in the primary Earth-616 timeline in which most Marvel Comics are set.

Mary Jane became pregnant at the beginning of the Clone Saga. Impending fatherhood was one of the main reasons Peter retired as Spider-Man during that story-line, passing the mantle to Ben Reilly. However, at the end of the story, Mary Jane was poisoned by Alison Mongrain, an agent of the Green Goblin, and the baby was stillborn (or seemed to be, as Mongrain took the infant away with her). The stillbirth of his child, combined with the death of Ben Reilly at the hands of the Green Goblin that same night, prompts Peter to retake the Spider-Man identity.

There were hints during the &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; story-line, one of Tom DeFalco&#x27;s last story-lines on the title, that Baby May would be returned. Instead, the subplot was dropped, and a few issues later DeFalco was replaced by Howard Mackie and John Byrne. Under that team, Aunt May was brought back instead. In a flashback in &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; #49, an alternative version of this story was presented, with the younger May returned instead of the elder.

However, baby May and her parents were never reunited in Marvel&#x27;s main continuity. Editors repeatedly stated that the baby died, or at the very least would never be seen again; the child was considered a major factor in the aging of the characters. In &quot;Marvel Knights Spider-Man&quot; issue #9, Mac Gargan, while speaking of Norman Osborn, states &quot;He kills your unborn child, you kill his son&quot;. To date, this is the most conclusive evidence of the infant&#x27;s fate.

The action in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #439 (Defalco&#x27;s last on the title) takes place 1,000 years in the future. Two archaeologists stumble across relics belonging to Spider-Man (such as his web-shooters). They speculate on his career, and discuss other heroes who were inspired by him, Spider-Girl and Spider-Man 2099.

In several interviews at Comic Book Resources following the publication of &quot;One More Day,&quot; Joe Quesada mentioned that the Spider-Girl title would be the ideal place for disgruntled readers to follow the development of an aged, married Peter and M.J. as they raise a family. Quesada&#x27;s comments were followed by a feature article on Spider-Girl with an interview with Tom Defalco, who acknowledged that Quesada was a fan of the character and the title. Moreover, during the &#x27;One More Day/Brand New Day&#x27; story arc, Peter and Mary Jane have visions of a very young girl with red hair, who, after the deal is made with Mephisto, is revealed to be the daughter they would never have now that the deal is done. Despite this, Quesada has stated that he feels the MC2 universe is the natural progression of the characters.

During the &quot;Sinister War&quot; arc, it is revealed that Mephisto erased the Parkers&#x27; marriage to ensure that their daughter does not exist, as she would one day end his eventual reign over the Earth.

===&quot;Earth X&quot;===
There are two variant and alternate universe versions of Spider-Girl. One was raised by a Ben Reilly who survived after her father died during her childhood, as seen &quot;What If?&quot; vol. 2 #86, and later revealed in the &quot;Paradise X: Heralds&quot; miniseries. Another version of Spider-Girl is actually Venom, who is seen in the &quot;Earth X&quot; miniseries and its two sequels, &quot;Universe X&quot; and &quot;Paradise X&quot;.

The Venom version of May Parker is later recruited by Kang the Conqueror as part of a scheme against the Apocalypse Twins and the Avengers Unity Squad.

The world of MC2 is designated as &quot;Earth-982&quot;. The world where Spider-Girl was raised by Ben Reilly (as May Reilly) is known as &quot;Earth-1122&quot; and the world featuring Venom as Spider-Girl along with the other heroes of the &quot;Earth X&quot; saga is known as &quot;Earth-9997&quot;.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Clone Saga&quot;===
In 2009, Marvel published a miniseries based on the original plans for the Clone Saga. As in the original Clone Saga, Allison Mongraine kidnaps the infant May after she is born. However, the circumstances are a bit different. Mary Jane and Peter actually get to hold May before she is stolen, and Mongraine later hands the baby over to Kaine (who is working for the Green Goblin in this continuity). Holding the baby in his arms makes Kaine begin to doubt the Goblin&#x27;s plans. His shadowy boss (later revealed to be Harry Osborn) notes to Kaine &quot;You&#x27;ll have to kill her if things go wrong.&quot; At the end of the series, Kaine returns May to Peter and Mary Jane.

===&quot;Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot;===
In a time-travel arc taking place in the UK-based publication &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, aimed at a much younger audience, Peter meets a Spider-Girl whilst trailing the Sandman in the future. With the aid of Spider-Girl and H.E.R.B.I.E., Peter defeats the Sandman and returns to his own time with H.E.R.B.I.E. At the conclusion of the strip, Spider-Girl returns home to her parents, revealed as Peter and Mary Jane Parker, and unmasks to reveal the features of Mayday Parker. Mayday tells her parents of her experience with a &quot;new Spider-Man&quot;, before Peter assures her that the individual she met was a past version of himself. Peter also reveals in the conversation that, like his MC2 counterpart, he was forced to abandon his career as Spider-Man due to a leg injury. This continuity is separate from both MC2 and 616, making this the second continuity to adapt the MC2 version of how Peter relinquished the Spider-Man identity.

Mayday would again cross paths with her father&#x27;s past self when Lady Octopus travels back in time to assassinate him. Mayday teams with her father but does not reveal her identity to him, despite desperately wanting to, for fear it may damage the timeline. The two defeat Lady Octopus and Mayday returns to the future.

===Swiney-Girl===
Tom Defalco briefly returned to his other Marvel creation Spider-Ham, an alternate version of Spider-Man that is a pig, in 2009 and 2010. Within those stories he introduced an alternate version of Spider-Girl known as Swiney-Girl (May &quot;Mayday&quot; Porker), who has similar background history with Spider-Girl, with her being the daughter of Peter Porker and Mary Crane Watsow, her father losing his leg after the final battle between Norman Osbird/Green Gobbler, and saving her father as Swiney-Girl from the grandson of the Green Gobbler, Norman Osbird Jr.

===&quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot;===

In this continuity, Peter and Mary Jane have a daughter named Annie May Parker, who eventually becomes the superhero Spiderling. While it was believed she was the world&#x27;s version of Spider-Girl, it eventually was revealed that the Clone Saga from the 616 continuity still happened in this world, which makes Annie May&#x27;s younger sister.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;===
In this continuity, Peter and Mary Jane have twins named Benjy and Claire Parker. Despite having a different name, Claire bears a strong resemblance in both appearance and personality to Mayday. For the first ten years of their lives, the two were solely raised by Mary Jane in Portland, Oregon after she left Peter following a traumatic incident. In 1995, Peter lets Ben Reilly take over his life as Spider-Man and CEO of Parker Industries so he could return to his family. In the mid-2000s, Claire convinces Peter to return to New York and become Spider-Man once more shortly after Morlun kills Ben Reilly so he could stop Tony Stark from taking over Parker Industries and to lure Morlun away from his family. Despite his efforts, Morlun attacks the twins and Mary Jane in Oregon as Peter gets involved in the superhero Civil War. When Benjy discovers that Morlun is vulnerable when he is feeding off someone, he uses himself as bait to allow Claire the chance to impale him on a splintered log of wood. Benjy survives the assault, but is crippled for life. By 2019, Claire has become Spider-Woman (now wearing a costume similar to Ultimate Jessica Drew&#x27;s), and is instructed by her father to stay behind to protect her brother and mother as he goes to space to end Doctor Doom&#x27;s reign of terror on the planet with Miles Morales.

===Ultimate Universe===
On Earth-6160, the Maker changed the past so that Peter never got his powers as a teenager. In the present, he is happily married to Mary Jane and they have two kids, a teenage son named Richard and a younger daughter named May. After Peter receives the radioactive spider from Tony Stark to become Spider-Man, May becomes the first one to discover his secret after seeing him in their kitchen late at night. She promises to keep his secret from Mary Jane and Richard until the time is right and inspires him to change his black picotech suit into his familiar red and blue costume as the black suit frightened her.

<text>The Territory of Florida was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 30, 1822, until March 3, 1845, when it was admitted to the Union as the State of Florida. Originally the major portion of the Spanish territory of , and later the provinces of East Florida and West Florida, it was ceded to the United States as part of the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty. It was governed by the Florida Territorial Council.

==Background==

The first European known to have encountered Florida was Juan Ponce de León, who claimed the land as a possession of Spain in 1513. St. Augustine, the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in the continental U.S., was founded on the northeast coast of Florida in 1565. Florida continued to remain a Spanish possession until the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, when Spain ceded it to the Kingdom of Great Britain in exchange for the release of Havana. In 1783, after the American Revolution, Great Britain ceded Florida back to Spain under the provisions of the Peace of Paris.

The second term of Spanish rule was influenced by the nearby United States. There were border disputes along the boundary with the state of Georgia and issues of American use of the Mississippi River. These disputes were ostensibly solved in 1795 by the Treaty of San Lorenzo, which, among other things, solidified the boundary of Florida and Georgia along the 31st parallel. However, as Thomas Jefferson once predicted, the U.S. could not keep its hands off Florida.

== Pre-1821 American involvement ==
In 1812, United States forces and Georgia &quot;patriots&quot; under General George Mathews unsuccessfully invaded Florida to protect American interests. The &quot;Patriot War&quot; was perceived as ill-advised by many Americans. President James Madison withdrew his support, and the Spanish authorities were promised a speedy exit of the American troops.

The Spanish government offered runaway slaves freedom if they converted to Catholicism and agreed to a term of military service. Under heavy pressure from the U.S., Spain reversed this policy in the late 18th century, to little effect. Slaves continued to flee to Florida, where they were sheltered by the Florida natives, called Seminoles by Americans. They lived in a semi-feudal system; the Seminoles gave the Blacks protection, while the former slaves, who knew how to farm, shared crops with the natives. Although the escaped slaves were still considered inferior by the Seminoles, the two groups lived in harmony. The slaveholders in Georgia and the rest of the South became furious over this state of affairs as slaves continued to escape to Florida.

In 1818, after years of additional conflicts involving natives, fugitive slaves, and settlers, General Andrew Jackson wrote to President James Monroe, who had been inaugurated in March 1817, informing him that he was invading Florida. Jackson&#x27;s force departed from Tennessee and marched down to the Florida Panhandle. Spanish officers surrendered coastal fortifications at Fort San Marcos (also known as Fort St. Marks) in and, about six weeks later, Fort Barrancas and Pensacola in .

== Adams–Onís Treaty ==

The Adams–Onís Treaty, also known as the Transcontinental Treaty, was signed on February 22, 1819, by John Quincy Adams and Luis de Onís y González-Vara, but did not take effect until after it was ratified by Spain on October 24, 1820, and by the United States on February 19, 1821. The U.S. received Florida under Article 2 and inherited Spanish claims to the Oregon Territory under Article 3, while ceding all its claims on Texas to Spain under Article 3 (with the independence of Mexico in 1821, Spanish Texas became Mexican territory), and pledged to indemnify up to $5,000,000 in claims by American citizens against Spain under Article 11. Under Article 15, Spanish goods received exclusive most favored nation tariff privileges in the ports at Pensacola and St. Augustine for twelve years.

In &quot;Dorr v. United States&quot; (195 U.S. 138, 141–142 (1904)) Justice Marshall is quoted more extensively as follows:

The 6th article of the treaty of cession contains the following provision:
&#x27;The inhabitants of the territories which His Catholic Majesty cedes the United States by this treaty shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States.&#x27; [8 Stat. at L. 256.]

[195 U.S. 138, 142] &#x27;This treaty is the law of the land, and admits the inhabitants of Florida to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States. It is unnecessary to inquire whether this is not their condition, independent of stipulation. They do not, however, participate in political power; they do not share in the government till Florida shall become a state. In the meantime Florida continues to be a territory of the United States, governed by virtue of that clause in the Constitution which empowers Congress &#x27;to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.&quot;

==Transfer to Governor Andrew Jackson==
On July 10, 1821, the province of East Florida was transferred to Governor Andrew Jackson with strict orders from President James Monroe to observe diplomatic protocol, with West Florida following one week later. Governor Jackson was not involved in the earliest government appointments in the territory and was only acquainted with two of them.

==Territorial Florida period==

President James Monroe was authorized on March 3, 1821, to take possession of East Florida and West Florida for the United States and provide for initial governance. Andrew Jackson served as the federal military commissioner with the powers of governor of the newly acquired territory, from March 10 through December 1821. On March 30, 1822, the United States merged East Florida and part of what formerly constituted West Florida into the Florida Territory. William Pope Duval became the first official governor of the Florida Territory and soon afterward the capital was established at Tallahassee, but only after removing a Seminole tribe from the land. The new capital of Tallahassee was located approximately halfway between the old colonial capitals of Pensacola and St. Augustine. Duval&#x27;s &quot;government palace for a time was a mere log house, and he lived on hunters&#x27; fare.&quot;

The central conflict of Territorial Florida originated from attempts to displace the Seminole people. The federal government and most white settlers desired all Florida Indians to migrate to the West voluntarily. On May 28, 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act requiring all Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi River. The Act itself did not mean much to Florida, but it laid the framework for the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing, which was signed by a council of Seminole chiefs on May 9, 1832, and ratified in 1834. This treaty stated that the Seminoles could organize an exploratory party that would travel to the Indian Territory and survey the assigned lands before they had to agree to relocation, though inhabitants of Florida were expected to relocate by 1835. It was at this meeting that the famous Osceola first voiced his decision to fight. At the Treaty of Fort Gibson, held in Arkansas Territory between the group of Seminoles sent to explore the new territory and the federal government, Americans led the Seminole into agreeing to the terms of relocation, although Seminoles would later claim to having been tricked into this agreement.

Beginning in late 1835, Osceola and the Seminole allies began a guerrilla war against the U.S. forces. Numerous generals fought and failed, succumbing to the heat and disease as well as lack of knowledge of the land. It was not until General Thomas Jesup captured many of the key Seminole chiefs, including Osceola who died in captivity of illness, that the battles began to die down. The Seminoles were eventually forced to migrate. Florida joined the Union as the 27th state on March 3, 1845. By this time, almost all of the Seminoles were gone, except for a small group living in the Everglades.

A referendum was held in 1837 about statehood with a majority voting in favor of it.

=== Proposed boundary modifications ===
During the territorial period of Florida, it was proposed several times that the territory be either split or that parts of the territory be added to Alabama. Even after Tallahassee was chosen to be the capital because it was halfway between Pensacola and St. Augustine, there was still a feeling of disconnection between East and West Florida because those two cities, which were the two largest settlements when the United States acquired Florida, were by land and by water from each other. 

On December 18, 1821, the Alabama state legislature passed a resolution asking the U.S. Congress to annex the portion of Florida west of the Apalachicola River, but nothing materialized from the proposal. Florida&#x27;s territorial delegate, Joseph Marion Hernández, introduced a resolution on January 28, 1823, that Florida be split into two separate territories, but the resolution was defeated. 

In the late 1830s, the proposal to divide the territory picked up traction once again. In January 1839, a committee for the constitutional convention urged the U.S. Congress to consider the idea of Florida statehood, and later that month, a letter was received by Congress from Florida petitioning the Florida Territory be split, which confused Congress. On April 22, 1840, Congress received a petition from several hundred backers in St. Augustine asking to split the territory in two, with the Suwanee River being the dividing line between East and West Florida. Another proposal came from Pensacola that year proposing the Florida Territory west of the Suwannee River be annexed by Alabama. In the spring of 1840, a bill was introduced in Congress to divide the Florida Territory along the Suwannee River but was defeated. The failure of these attempts to split the territory helped lead to the conclusion among those wanting statehood that Florida must be admitted as a whole as a state or stay as a territory. A bill was introduced in 1845 in the US House to give statehood to East and West Florida but was later struck down by a vote of 123-77; instead Florida would be admitted as one state and the bill ended up passing in the end by a vote of 145-34.

== Government ==
The governor of the Florida Territory was appointed by the US president. Governors had the power to veto legislation and the US Congress also had the power. Florida, similarly to the Orleans Territory, had a unicameral legislature called the Florida Legislative Council, which lasted until 1838 when President Van Buren signed a bill into law replacing the Legislative Council with a Senate and House of Representatives. The council had thirteen members who were selected by the President and confirmed by the US Senate for a one year term. This changed in 1826 when those who lived in the territory could vote on who they wanted as members of the legislature.

A judicial system was organized by the federal government. Initially in 1822 there were two judicial districts with more judicial districts being created over time. Superior courts existed at the county level but did not exist in every county. Under the superior courts were county courts which not only dealt with judicial matters but also functioned similarly to county commissions.

A constitution was written in the winter of 1838 and 1839 in St. Joseph which was based on several other state constitutions. The constitution was later ratified in a referendum held in May 1839.

== Demographics ==
A census was taken in 1825 by the territorial government. Another was taken in 1838 and the population was reported as being 41,224. However no results were returned for five counties (Mosquito, Nassau, Columbia, Hamilton and Duval) and no official documents of the census are known to survive with all information coming from newspapers reporting on it. The population estimate when including the other five counties based on &quot;the number of voters in delinquent counties&quot; is placed at 48,831 with 25,173 being white and 23,658 being black.

In the 1830 US Census the largest cities in Florida were: St. Augustine, Tallahassee and Key West in that order.

=== By county ===
In the 1840 United States census, 20 counties in the Florida Territory reported the following population counts (after 15 reported the following counts in the 1830 United States census):
== Economics ==
Similarly to the rest of the southeast at the time, the Florida Territory allowed slavery. A slave code was created in 1828. Slavery in Florida &quot;[b]etween 1821 and 1861&quot; could mostly be found in areas where cotton was grown between the Apalachicola and Suwannee Rivers, along the St. Johns River, and near St. Augustine, but an exception to this was along the Manatee River where slaves cultivated and harvested sugarcane. Slavery was much rarer in the southern counties of the territory. The area between the Apalachicola and Suwannee Rivers was referred to as Middle Florida during the territorial period.

<doc id="503161" wikidata="Q1169717" url="?curid=503161" title="Sylvia (2003 film)">
<text>Sylvia is a 2003 British biographical drama film directed by Christine Jeffs and starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Daniel Craig, Jared Harris, and Michael Gambon. It tells a story based on the real-life romance between prominent poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. The film begins with their meeting at Cambridge in 1956 and ends with Sylvia Plath&#x27;s suicide in 1963.

==Plot==
Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1932, Plath developed a precocious talent as a writer, publishing her first poem when she was only eight years old. That same year, tragedy introduced itself into her life as Plath was forced to confront the unexpected death of her father. In 1950, she began studying at Smith College on a literary scholarship, and while she was an outstanding student, she also began suffering from bouts of extreme depression. Following her junior year, she attempted suicide for the first time. Plath survived, and, in 1955, she was granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study in England at the University of Cambridge.

The film begins with a shot of Plath sleeping, then opening her eyes. As a student at Cambridge she rides along on her red bicycle and wearing an academic gown. She hears of a party to celebrate the publishing of a magazine called St. Botolph&#x27;s, where she meets the young poet Ted Hughes. The two fall in love and marry in 1956, then go off to Massachusetts where her mother Aurelia lives. While they are both teaching at Smith College, Sylvia quickly learns that others are also enthralled by her husband, due to his combination of good looks, charisma, fame and success. They return to England, first to London and then to Devon, where Sylvia raises their two children and lives in her husband&#x27;s professional shadow as she tries to eke out her own writing career, which doesn&#x27;t come as naturally to her as it does to Ted. After a visit by David and Assia Wevill, who had rented their London flat, Sylvia rightly accuses Ted of infidelity. She kicks him out and then begins to write the poems that would be published posthumously in her collection titled Ariel. Sylvia then moves back to London with her children. Ted visits at Christmas and they make love again but he says he cannot leave Assia, who is pregnant. Shortly thereafter she prepares for her suicide, sealing off the children&#x27;s room from the gas from her gas oven. A nurse comes to take out the children and Ted sees Plath&#x27;s manuscript on her desk. A closing title informs us that her book made her much beloved and that Ted wrote his response in 1998 (just before his death), in a collection titled &quot;Birthday Letters&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
Frieda Hughes, Sylvia Plath&#x27;s daughter, objected to the making of the film and denied BBC Films the rights to her mother&#x27;s poetry. Hughes published a poem in the magazine &quot;Tatler&quot;, which contained the line, &quot;They think I should give them my mother&#x27;s words/To fill the mouth of their monster/Their Sylvia Suicide Doll.&quot;

Pawel Pawlikowski was originally attached to direct. However, he left due to the lack of artistic control he was given. &quot;I walked away because the script wasn’t good, and it became a Hollywood film, where you didn’t have much control. With my methods of sculpting and changing things, I would have got fired after a week,&quot; he said.

Filming took place between October 2002 and February 2003. Much of the film was shot in and around the New Zealand city of Dunedin, with the University of Otago serving to represent Cambridge.

==Reception==
On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Sylvia&quot; has a 36% &quot;rotten&quot; approval rating based on 132 critics&#x27; reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;This biopic about Sylvia Plath doesn&#x27;t rise above the level of highbrow melodrama.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 56 out of 100 based on 40 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of a possible four stars, praising Paltrow and Craig&#x27;s performances. A.O. Scott, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, also praised Paltrow&#x27;s portrayal of Plath, but wrote that, &quot;The psychological dynamics of the marriage, unsettled by professional envy and sexual jealousy, are duly noted, but the film&#x27;s emotions are too big, too untidy and too strange to be contained by its story.&quot;

Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; also praised the performances, but said the film falls short of &quot;depicting Plath as an artist. We don&#x27;t learn what inspired her to pursue writing as an outlet for her emotional turmoil.&quot; Puig also commented that the movie &quot;glosses over&quot; what led Plath and Hughes to drift apart from each other. Writing for &quot;Slate&quot;, Meghan O&#x27;Rourke said while the film &quot;purports to be interested in Plath as an artist, it tends to reinforce the old clichés about her work.&quot; O&#x27;Rourke added it &quot;fails to explore the fact that Plath was one of the first major American poets to be a mother and to take the pleasure of motherhood as her subject.&quot;

<text>Raymond Allen Liotta (; December 18, 1954 – May 26, 2022) was an American actor. He first gained attention for his role in the film &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986), which earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination. He was best known for his portrayals of Shoeless Joe Jackson in the film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; (1989) and Henry Hill in the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990). Liotta appeared in numerous other films, including &quot;Unlawful Entry&quot; (1992), &quot;Cop Land&quot; (1997), &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001), &quot;John Q.,&quot; &quot;Narc&quot; (both 2002), &quot;Identity&quot; (2003), &quot;Killing Them Softly&quot;, &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot; (both 2012), and &quot;Marriage Story&quot; (2019).

He had a prominent voice acting role as Tommy Vercetti in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; (2002).

After his death in 2022, Liotta was posthumously recognized on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 24, 2023. His films that were released posthumously include &quot;Cocaine Bear&quot;, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Waters&quot; (all 2023), and &quot;1992&quot; (2024).

==Early life and education==
Liotta was born in Newark, New Jersey, on December 18, 1954. Having been abandoned at an orphanage, he was adopted at the age of six months by township clerk Mary (née Edgar) and auto parts store owner Alfred Liotta. His adoptive parents were Scottish and Italian Americans. Alfred was a personnel director and president of a local Democratic Party club. His adoptive parents each unsuccessfully ran for local political office; he recalled attending parades to hand out flyers for his father&#x27;s run.

Liotta had a sister, Linda, who was also adopted. He said that he knew that he was adopted as a young child, and presented a show-and-tell report. He hired a private detective to locate his biological mother, named Ruth, in the 2000s, from whom he learned his family was of Scottish descent. He had one biological sister, one biological half-brother also named Ray, and five biological half-sisters.

Liotta grew up in a Roman Catholic household in Union, New Jersey, although his family was not especially religious. They attended church and he received first communion and was confirmed, but the family did not pray much. He occasionally used prayer in his daily life, telling an interviewer, &quot;... if I&#x27;m in a fix, I&#x27;ll pray ... if I&#x27;m feeling uncomfortable about something, I&#x27;ll say &quot;Our Fathers&quot; and &quot;Hail Marys&quot; to this day.&quot; In 1973, he graduated from Union High School, and was later named to the Union High School Hall of Fame.

Liotta attended the University of Miami, where he studied acting and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1978. He performed in plays and musicals, including &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Dames at Sea&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, at the University of Miami&#x27;s Jerry Herman Ring Theatre.

==Career==

After graduating from the University of Miami, Liotta moved to New York City, where he was hired as a bartender at the Shubert Organization and landed an agent within six months. One of his earliest roles was as Joey Perrini on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;, on which he appeared from 1978 to 1981. He left the show and moved to Los Angeles. He made his film debut in 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Lonely Lady&quot;. His first major acting role was &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986), for which he received his first Golden Globe nomination, this nomination being for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. In 1989, Liotta played the ghost of baseball player Shoeless Joe Jackson in the fantasy/drama film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;.

In 1990, Liotta portrayed real-life mobster Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s universally praised and commercially successful Academy Award winning film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.

In 2004, Liotta made his Broadway debut opposite Frank Langella in the Stephen Belber play &quot;Match&quot;. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Liotta as &quot;compelling&quot; but &quot;doesn&#x27;t have much to work with for his Broadway debut.&quot; That same year he appeared in an advertisement for Heineken in the UK. The ads were eventually pulled by Ofcom &quot;in breach of the advertising code for implying that stronger alcohol is better.&quot;

In 2007, Liotta appeared with John Travolta in the film &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;, and in &quot;Battle in Seattle&quot; as the city&#x27;s mayor. In 2008, he starred in &quot;Hero Wanted&quot; as a detective alongside Cuba Gooding Jr. Also in 2008, he made a guest appearance on the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?&quot;.

In 2009 he appeared in &quot;Crossing Over&quot;, co-starring Harrison Ford. Liotta played Detective Harrison in the 2009 Jody Hill comedy &quot;Observe and Report&quot; as Seth Rogen&#x27;s nemesis from the local police. In 2011, he starred in &quot;The Son of No One&quot;, opposite Channing Tatum and Al Pacino.

In the 2010s, Liotta appeared in &quot;Date Night&quot; with Steve Carell, in &quot;Charlie St. Cloud&quot; with Zac Efron, the independent drama &quot;Snowmen&quot;, and &quot;The River Sorrow&quot;, which stars Liotta as a detective alongside Christian Slater and Ving Rhames.

His other 2014 projects include &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot; with Jeremy Renner, &quot;Stretch&quot; with Chris Pine, and a David Guetta video. He starred in the Western miniseries &quot;Texas Rising&quot; for The History Channel in 2015. For his performance he earned a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie nomination.

Liotta appeared as Charlie Barber&#x27;s (Adam Driver) second divorce attorney, Jay Marotta in the 2019 Noah Baumbach film &quot;Marriage Story&quot;. The film received critical acclaim and earned six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. Liotta received praise for his performance with Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; declaring, &quot;what a thrill to hear his syrupy-gravelly voice again&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described Liotta as being in &quot;fine, mischievous form&quot;. In 2021, he played twin brothers &quot;Hollywood Dick&quot; Moltisanti and Salvatore &quot;Sally&quot; Moltisanti in the film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;, a prequel to the HBO crime drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

Liotta appeared in &quot;Cocaine Bear&quot;, a thriller film based on the true story of an American black bear that ingested a duffel bag full of cocaine in 1985. The movie, released in theaters in February 2023, is directed by Elizabeth Banks and traces the aftermath of a drug runner&#x27;s cocaine disappearing in a plane crash and being devoured by a bear. The movie was dedicated to his memory.

==Personal life==

Liotta married Michelle Grace, an actress and producer, in February 1997 after they met at a baseball game, where her former husband Mark Grace was playing for the Chicago Cubs. They had a daughter, Karsen, before divorcing amicably in 2004.

On an episode of &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage&quot;, Liotta revealed that Nancy and Tina Sinatra once sent Liotta a fake horse&#x27;s head in the mail. The joke was in response to Liotta&#x27;s declining to play their father in a miniseries they were working on, only to see Liotta play him in the 1998 HBO television film &quot;The Rat Pack&quot;.

In February 2007, he was charged with driving under the influence after crashing his Cadillac Escalade into two parked vehicles in Pacific Palisades. He pleaded no contest.

From his experience shooting the Western &quot;Texas Rising&quot;, Liotta continued horseback riding and said in September 2014: &quot;I was obsessed with riding horses [on the show]. I love it now. I&#x27;ve never had a hobby. It might be my new hobby.&quot;

In May 2017, Liotta, along with talk show host and actress Kelly Ripa, was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

In 2018, while discussing his role alongside Jennifer Lopez as a corrupt cop targeted by the FBI in the NBC crime drama &quot;Shades of Blue&quot;, Liotta told a reporter for &quot;Long Island Weekly&quot;: 
In 2022, after wrapping up filming of &quot;Cocaine Bear&quot;, Liotta made a speech and stated that he was known for being Italian, but he did a heritage tree and found that he mostly has Irish ancestry.

==Death==
Liotta died in his sleep on May 26, 2022, at age 67, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, during the filming of &quot;Dangerous Waters&quot;. At the time of his death, he was engaged to Jacy Nittolo. An autopsy report released in 2023 concluded that Liotta&#x27;s cause of death was respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and heart failure, with atherosclerosis cited as an underlying issue.

Liotta was posthumously recognized on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 24, 2023, with his daughter Karsen collecting the recognition on his behalf.

<doc id="503169" wikidata="Q2413649" url="?curid=503169" title="John List (murderer)">
<text>John Emil List (September 17, 1925 – March 21, 2008) was an American mass murderer and long-time fugitive. On November 9, 1971, he killed his wife, mother, and three children at their home in Westfield, New Jersey, and then disappeared. He had planned the murders so meticulously that nearly a month passed before anyone suspected that anything was amiss.

List assumed a new identity, remarried, and eluded justice for nearly 18 years. He was finally apprehended in Virginia on June 1, 1989, after the story of his murders was broadcast on the television program &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. After extradition to New Jersey, he was convicted on five counts of first degree murder and sentenced to five consecutive terms of life imprisonment, making him ineligible for parole for nearly 75 years.

List gave critical financial problems, as well as his perception that his family members were straying from their religious faith, as his motivations for the murders. He believed that killing them would assure their souls a place in heaven, where he hoped to eventually join them. List ended up dying in prison in 2008, at the age of 82.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Bay City, Michigan, List was the only child of German American parents John Frederick List (1859–1944) and Alma Barbara Florence List (1887–1971). Like his father, List was a devout Lutheran and a Sunday school teacher. List graduated from Bay City Central High School in 1943. That same year, he enlisted in the United States Army and served as a laboratory technician during World War II. His father died in 1944. After List was discharged in 1946, he enrolled at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration and a master&#x27;s degree in accounting, and was commissioned a lieutenant through ROTC.

== Military service and civilian career ==
In November 1950, as the Korean War escalated, List was recalled to active military service. At Fort Eustis in Virginia, he met Helen Morris Taylor, the widow of an infantry officer killed in action in Korea, who lived nearby with her daughter, Brenda. John and Helen married on December 1, 1951, in Baltimore, Maryland, and the family moved to northern California. The Army, recognizing List&#x27;s accounting skills, reassigned him to the Finance Corps.

After completion of his second tour in 1952, List worked for an accounting firm in Detroit, and then as an audit supervisor at a paper company in Kalamazoo, where his three children were born. By 1959, List had risen to general supervisor of the company&#x27;s accounting department; but Helen, an alcoholic, had become increasingly unstable due to syphilis she had contracted from her first husband, which she did not disclose to List before their marriage. In 1960, his stepdaughter Brenda married and left the household, and List moved with the remainder of his family to Rochester, New York, to take a job with Xerox. There, he eventually became director of accounting services. In 1965, List accepted a position as vice president and comptroller at a bank in Jersey City, New Jersey, and moved with his wife, children, and mother into Breeze Knoll, a 19-room Victorian mansion, located at 431 Hillside Avenue in Westfield, New Jersey.

== Murders ==

On November 9, 1971, List murdered his entire immediate family, using his 9mm Steyr 1912 semi-automatic handgun and his father&#x27;s Colt .22 calibre revolver. While his children were at school, he shot his wife, Helen, 47, in the back of the head, then his mother Alma, 84, above the left eye. As his daughter Patricia, 16, and younger son Frederick, 13, arrived home from school, List shot each of them in the back of the head. After making himself lunch, List drove to his bank to close his and his mother&#x27;s bank accounts, then to Westfield High School to watch his elder son John Frederick, 15, play in a soccer game. After driving John Frederick home, List shot him repeatedly because, as misfire evidence showed, his son attempted to defend himself.

List placed the bodies of his wife and children on sleeping bags in the mansion&#x27;s ballroom. He left his mother&#x27;s body in her apartment in the attic. In a five-page letter to his pastor found on the desk in his study, List claimed that he saw too much evil in the world, and he had killed his family to save their souls. He then cleaned the various crime scenes, removed his picture from all family photographs in the house, tuned a radio to a religious station, and departed.

The murders were not discovered until December 7, nearly a month later, partly because of the family&#x27;s reclusive tendencies and also due to notes List sent to the children&#x27;s schools and part-time jobs claiming that the children would be visiting their ailing maternal grandmother in North Carolina for a few weeks. Helen&#x27;s mother was ill and had cancelled a visit to Westfield because of it; had she made the trip, List later said, she would have been his sixth victim. List also stopped milk, mail, and newspaper deliveries. Neighbors noticed that all of the mansion&#x27;s rooms were illuminated day and night with no apparent activity within the house. After light bulbs began burning out one by one, they called the police. Officers entered through an unlocked window leading to the basement and discovered the family&#x27;s bodies.

Westfield, which had few violent crimes recorded since 1963, received national attention as the site of one of the most notorious felonies in New Jersey since the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh Jr. A nationwide manhunt was launched. Police investigated hundreds of leads without success. All reliable photographs of List had been destroyed. The family car (a green 1963 Chevrolet Impala sedan) was found parked at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, but police found no evidence that List had boarded a flight. Alma&#x27;s body was flown to Frankenmuth, Michigan, and interred at the Saint Lorenz Lutheran Cemetery. Helen and her three children were buried at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield.

Breeze Knoll remained empty until it was destroyed by fire in August 1972, nine months after the murders. Although the destruction was officially ruled arson, it remains unsolved with no suspects. Destroyed along with the home was the ballroom&#x27;s stained glass skylight, rumored to be a signed Tiffany original, worth at least $100,000 at the time (). A new house was built on the site in 1974.

== Relocation, arrest, and trial ==
In 1971, as the FBI later discovered, List had traveled by train from New Jersey first to Michigan, then to Colorado. He settled in Denver in early 1972 and took an accounting job under the name Robert Peter &quot;Bob&quot; Clark, one of his college classmates (although the real Bob Clark later stated that he had never known List). From 1979 to 1986, he was the comptroller at a paper box manufacturer outside Denver. He joined a Lutheran congregation and ran a car pool for church members without transport. At one religious gathering, he met an Army PX clerk named Delores Miller and they were married in 1985. In February 1988, the couple moved to a house in the Brandermill neighborhood of Midlothian, Virginia, where List, still using the name Bob Clark, resumed work as an accountant at a small accounting firm, Maddrea, Joyner, Kirkham &amp; Woody.

In 1972, List was proposed as a suspect in the D. B. Cooper air piracy case because of the timing of his disappearance (two weeks prior to the airline hijacking), multiple matches to the hijacker&#x27;s description, and the reasoning that &quot;a fugitive accused of mass murder has nothing to lose.&quot; List was questioned by FBI investigators after his capture, but he denied any involvement in the Cooper case. While his name is still occasionally mentioned in Cooper articles and documentaries, no direct evidence implicates him, and the FBI no longer considers him a suspect.

In May 1989, the 17 years, 6 months, 23 days old crime was recounted on the Fox television program &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; during its first year on the air. The segment featured an age-progressed clay bust, sculpted by forensic artist Frank Bender, which turned out to bear a close resemblance to List&#x27;s actual appearance. On June 1, less than two weeks after the broadcast, List was arrested at a Richmond accounting firm after a Denver neighbor recognized the description and alerted authorities. List continued to stand by his alias for several months, even after his 1989 extradition to Union County, New Jersey; finally, faced with irrefutable evidenceincluding a fingerprint match with List&#x27;s military records, as well as evidence found at the crime scenehe confessed his true identity on February 16, 1990.

At trial, List testified that his financial difficulties reached crisis level in 1971 when he was laid off with the closure of the Jersey City bank. To avoid sharing this humiliating development with his family, List engaged in the same routine and dress as when employed, leaving home each morning on schedule and spending the day at job interviews or at the Westfield train station, reading newspapers until it was time to come home. List diverted money from his mother&#x27;s bank accounts to avoid default on his mortgage. As the year progressed, the family&#x27;s financial problems became more strained; List encouraged his children to seek part-time work, ostensibly to teach them maturity and responsibility, but in actuality to help keep the family financially solvent.

He was also dealing with his wife&#x27;s alcoholism and her untreated tertiary syphilis, contracted from her first husband and concealed for 18 years. According to trial testimony, Helen had pressured List into marriage by falsely claiming that she was pregnant, then insisted that they marry in Maryland, which did not require the premarital syphilis test mandated in most other states at the time. Though her health progressively deteriorated, she said nothing to List or her physicians until 1969, when a thorough examination revealed the condition. By then, progression of the disease combined with her excessive alcohol consumption had, according to testimony, &quot;transformed her [into]... an unkempt and paranoid recluse&quot; who frequentlyand often publiclyhumiliated List, comparing his sexual prowess unfavorably with that of her first husband.

A court-appointed psychiatrist testified that List suffered from obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and that he saw only two solutions to his situation: accept welfare, or kill his family and send their souls to heaven. Welfare was an unacceptable option, he reasoned, because it would expose him and his family to ridicule and violate his authoritarian father&#x27;s teachings regarding the care and protection of family members.

On April 12, 1990, List was convicted of five counts of first degree murder. At his sentencing hearing, he denied direct responsibility for his actions: &quot;I feel that because of my mental state at the time, I was unaccountable for what happened. I ask all affected by this for their forgiveness, understanding and prayer.&quot; The judge was unpersuaded: &quot;John Emil List is without remorse and without honor,&quot; he said. &quot;After 18 years, five months and 22 days, it is now time for the voices of Helen, Alma, Patricia, Frederick and John F. List to rise from the grave.&quot; He imposed a sentence of five terms of life imprisonment, to be served consecutively, the maximum permissible penalty at the time.

List filed an appeal of his convictions on grounds that his judgment had been impaired by post-traumatic stress disorder due to his military service. He also argued that the letter he left behind at the crime scene, essentially his confession, was a confidential communication to his pastor and therefore inadmissible as evidence. A federal appeals court rejected both arguments.

List eventually expressed a degree of remorse for his crimes. &quot;I wish I had never done what I did,&quot; he told Connie Chung in 2002. &quot;I&#x27;ve regretted my action and prayed for forgiveness ever since.&quot; When asked why he had not taken his own life, he said he believed that suicide would have prevented him from going to heaven, where he hoped to be reunited with his family.

== Death ==
List died of complications from pneumonia aged 82 on March 21, 2008, while imprisoned at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton, New Jersey. In reporting his death, the New Jersey &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; referred to him as &quot;The Boogeyman of Westfield.&quot;

== Television, film, and pop culture ==
Over the years, List and his crimes have furnished inspiration for documentaries, television dramas and feature films. Examples include &quot;Savior&quot;, season 6, episode 16 of the television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;; the 1987 film &quot;The Stepfather&quot; and its 2009 remake; the 1993 film &quot;Judgment Day: The John List Story&quot;, in which List was portrayed by Robert Blake; and the character Keyser Söze in the 1995 film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.

In 2008, John Walsh, the host of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, donated the age-progressed bust by Frank Bender that played a pivotal role in List&#x27;s apprehension to a forensic science exhibition at the National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment in Washington, D.C., whose collection was later moved to Alcatraz East Crime Museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

A 1996 episode of the series &quot;Forensic Files&quot; discussed the List murders. A 2003 episode of the A&amp;E series &quot;American Justice&quot; also detailed the case and featured an interview with List. In 2015, the story was covered in the season 2, episode 2 of the Investigation Discovery TV series &quot;Your Worst Nightmare&quot;. The episode, &quot;Murder House&quot;, premiered on November 18, 2015.

The movie &quot;A Killer Next Door&quot;, based on the events that led to the capture of John List, was released in July 2020.

In 2022, NJ Advance Media released &quot;Father Wants Us Dead&quot;, a podcast serial on the events.

Also in 2022, Netflix released a seven-part dramatic fictional miniseries called &quot;The Watcher&quot;. Although it is a work of fiction based on a real article, much of the character John Graff was borrowed from the story of the John List murders. The character of John Graff, played by Joe Mantello, was identical to John List in several ways, such as his being an accountant, attending a Lutheran church, and murdering his family members and live-in mother, along with leaving music playing in the house and planning an alibi that would cause the bodies to remain undiscovered for several weeks.

<text>Michigan Avenue is a north-south street in Chicago that runs at 100 east on the Chicago grid. The northern end of the street is at DuSable Lake Shore Drive on the shore of Lake Michigan in the Gold Coast Historic District. The street&#x27;s southern terminus is at Sibley Boulevard in the southern suburb of Dolton, but like many other Chicago streets, it exists in several disjointed segments.

As the home of the Chicago Water Tower, the Art Institute of Chicago, Millennium Park, and the shopping on the Magnificent Mile, it is a street well-known to Chicago natives as well as tourists to the city. Michigan Avenue also is the main commercial street of Streeterville. It includes all of the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and most of the Michigan–Wacker Historic District, including the scenic urban space anchored by the DuSable (Michigan Avenue) Bridge.

==History==

===19th century===
The oldest section of Michigan Avenue is the portion that currently borders Grant Park in the Chicago Loop section of the city. The name came from Lake Michigan, which until 1871 was immediately east of Michigan Avenue. The street at that time ran north to the Chicago River and south to the city limits. Michigan Avenue initially was primarily residential. By the 1860s, large homes and expensive row houses dominated Michigan Avenue.

At no point is Michigan Avenue currently called Michigan Boulevard, but prior to the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the street was officially known as Michigan Boulevard and often referred to as &quot;Boul Mich&quot;. But in the 1900–1907 ads for the Chicago Musical College, the address was referred to as &quot;202 Michigan Boul.&quot; As recently as the 1920s, North Michigan Avenue (especially the Magnificent Mile) was referred to as &quot;Upper Boul Mich&quot;. Paris&#x27;s Boulevard Saint-Michel is the original Boul Mich.

North of the Chicago River today&#x27;s Michigan Avenue was known as Pine Street. In 1866, a small portion of Pine Street was &quot;vacated&quot; and moved further west of the original Pine street location to accommodate the installation of the new pumping station&#x27;s standpipe. This standpipe, engineered to regulate water pressure, would be housed within architect William W. Boyington&#x27;s castle structure (Water Tower) that still stands on that site today. In 1869 the Board of Public Works began paving Pine Street from Chicago Avenue to Whitney street (today, Walton street) the northern terminus, with Belgian wood blocks also known as Nicolson pavement.

Pine Street was renamed to Lincoln Park Boulevard as far south as Ohio Street when the street connected with Lake Shore Drive in the early 1890s, and then became part of Michigan Avenue, which already had the name Michigan Avenue and was called Michigan Boulevard before the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, south of the Chicago River. Both the North and South Michigan Avenues were joined physically with the opening of the Michigan Avenue bridge in 1920. In 1926, after years of clogged automobile traffic, the water tower and pumping station were separated by realigning Michigan Avenue to run between them.

In the Great Fire of 1871, all buildings on Michigan Avenue from Congress Street north to the river were destroyed. Immediately after the fire, the character of Michigan remained residential, but the street no longer was directly on the lake shore, as after the Fire, wreckage from the burnt district was used to fill in the inner harbor of Chicago, beginning the landfills that by the 1920s had moved the lake shore more than a quarter-mile east of its original shoreline, creating space for an expanded Grant Park. Beginning in the 1880s, the expansion of the central business district replaced houses on Michigan Avenue so that today, Michigan&#x27;s character is primarily commercial north of 35th Street.

The first city showcase on Michigan Avenue was the Exposition Building, which was built on the current site of the Art Institute, the east side of Michigan at Adams, in 1874. By the 1890s, an imposing wall of buildings was constructed on the west side of Michigan Avenue downtown, including the Auditorium Building and the main branch of the Chicago Public Library (now the Chicago Cultural Center). As the east side of Michigan Avenue downtown was developed as a park, the wall of buildings lining the west side of Michigan Avenue across from the park became the nucleus of the city&#x27;s skyline.

===20th century===
In 1924, the first traffic lights in Chicago were installed on Michigan Avenue after John D. Hertz fronted the city $34,000 for the purchase, installation, and maintenance. In July 1940, the Russeks women&#x27;s clothing store chain opened up a store at 200 North Michigan Avenue. It was the first retail establishment in the Mid-West to be entirely equipped with fluorescent lighting, and was noted for being entirely air conditioned.

Historically, Illinois Route 1 and U.S. Route 41 were routed on Michigan Avenue. Illinois Route 1 has been truncated to Chicago&#x27;s south side and U.S. Route 41 is now routed on Lake Shore Drive.
==Route==
===North Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile===

Michigan Avenue originally ended at the Chicago River, and what is now Michigan Avenue north of the river was originally named Pine Street, after scattered pine trees originally found in its vicinity. As early as 1891, plans were proposed to extend Michigan Avenue north across the river. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street, and in 1903 an editorial in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper proposed a new Bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue.

This plan was further elaborated upon in Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 Plan of Chicago, and in 1911 a plan was selected that included the widening of Michigan Avenue from Randolph Street to the river, replacing the Rush Street bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue and the construction of a double-decked boulevard along Pine Street as far as Ohio Street. When the Michigan Avenue Bridge was completed, Pine Street was renamed Michigan Avenue. At its north end it merges into Lake Shore Drive near the Drake Hotel.

Today, the area north of the Chicago River is referred to as the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot;, or sometimes simply the Mag Mile. It contains a mixture of upscale department stores, restaurants, high-end retailers, office buildings and hotels, and caters primarily to tourists and the affluent. The area also has a high concentration of the city&#x27;s advertising agencies.

It is the home of Chicago&#x27;s famous Water Tower landmark, Jane Byrne Park around the Water Tower with its historic clock, as well as the eight-level Water Tower Place shopping center which grew up next door to, and overshadowed, the comparatively diminutive landmark. North of the shopping center can be found the famous John Hancock Center, the art deco Palmolive Building (also known as the &quot;Playboy&quot; Building) and the lavish Drake Hotel. The entire mile is noted for its spectacular Christmas displays. At the northern edge of this district can be found the One Magnificent Mile building; Chicago Landmark East Lake Shore Drive District, an extremely expensive and exclusive one-block area of real estate running east from North Michigan Avenue and facing directly onto Lake Michigan; and the on-ramp to northbound Lake Shore Drive.

===From the River southwards===
For a few blocks on both sides of the Chicago River, the road is double-decked, including the bridge over the river. The lower level north of the river is where the famous Billy Goat Tavern is located, and south of the river it intersects with Lower Wacker Drive. On the upper lever, tall office buildings and hotels line both sides of the Avenue, until Millennium Park.

The portion of Michigan Avenue opposite Grant Park is the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District. Major cultural institutions, such as the Chicago Cultural Center, Symphony Center, and the Auditorium Theater are located here, as are many late 19th and early 20th century skyscrapers. In 2009, the Chicago Cultural Mile Association was created to bring &quot;awareness of the unique strengths and diverse offerings available to visitors&quot; in this portion of Michigan Avenue.

The Art Institute of Chicago is across the boulevard, in Grant Park along the Avenue. Several large historic hotels are located just south of Ida B. Wells Drive, including the Hilton Towers Chicago (formerly, the Stevens Hotel), the Congress Plaza Hotel and the Blackstone Hotel. Between them is the Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies.

The Avenue extends south into Near South Side, Chicago and beyond – past what was once the notorious Levee District, the graceful homes of the Prairie Avenue District, the historic Second Presbyterian Church, the former home of the legendary Chess Records at 2120 South Michigan and the site where the Lexington Hotel, a hideout of Al Capone, once stood.

South of Cermak Road is the Motor Row District, a historic strip along Michigan Avenue that was home to many early 20th century automobile &quot;palaces.&quot; A point of interest in this area is the former Illinois Automobile Club, which later was used as the home of the Chicago Defender, a prominent African-American Chicago newspaper at 2400 South Michigan. A little bit further south is Bronzeville, a historic black community in Chicago. Points of interest include the historic Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, the Illinois College of Optometry and the South Side Community Art Center.

The intersection of Michigan Avenue and 35th Street is home to two important local institutions. On the northwest corner is De La Salle Institute, a Catholic high school which was attended by future Chicago mayors Richard J. Daley, Richard M. Daley, and Michael Bilandic. On the southwest corner is the Chicago Police Department Headquarters. Michigan Avenue continues through the South Side and dead ends at 63rd Street, just north of a rail yard and parking lots.

The Avenue continues heading south at 66th Street to Marquette Road, where it moves a half-block to the east back into alignment with the run north of 63rd Street. It then continues south to 89th Street where it dead ends once again for a housing subdivision and a railroad line. It resumes at 91st Street heading south through the working class Roseland community, featuring a large commercial strip along Michigan between 111th and 115th streets. The street dead ends again at 127th Street just before the Cal-Sag Channel. It begins again in the south suburb of Riverdale before finally terminating at Sibley Boulevard or IL RT-83.

==Transportation==
The Chicago &quot;L&quot; Red Line&#x27;s Chicago and Grand stations are useful for reaching the Magnificent Mile. Both the Monroe and Jackson stations are close to the Art Institute. Stations on the east side of the Loop (Adams/Wabash and Washington/Wabash stations) are also close to the Art Institute. Millennium and Van Buren Street stations are located east of Michigan Avenue serving the Metra Electric and South Shore Lines. The avenue is also traversed by a multitude of bus routes and taxi cabs primarily in the Downtown and Magnificent Mile areas.

South of downtown, plenty of bus routes (e.g. bus routes 1 and 4) continue to run south along Michigan Avenue before reaching the Bronzeville neighborhood. There are no bus routes along Michigan Avenue between 35th Street and 95th Street. South of 95th Street, more bus routes run along Michigan Avenue as multiple bus routes in the South Side end at the 95th/Dan Ryan station. At 121st Street, the State Street station on the Blue Island branch of the Metra Electric District serves Michigan Avenue.

<text>In linguistics, an object pronoun is a personal pronoun that is used typically as a grammatical object: the direct or indirect object of a verb, or the object of a preposition. Object pronouns contrast with subject pronouns. Object pronouns in English take the &quot;objective case&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;oblique case&quot; or &quot;object case&quot;.
For example, the English object pronoun &quot;me&quot; is found in &quot;They see me&quot; (direct object), &quot;He&#x27;s giving me my book&quot; (indirect object), and &quot;Sit with me&quot; (object of a preposition); this contrasts with the subject pronoun in &quot;I see them,&quot; &quot;I am getting my book,&quot; and &quot;I am sitting here.&quot;

==English==

The English personal and interrogative pronouns have the following subject and object forms:



==Archaic second person forms==

Historically, Middle English and Early Modern English retained the T–V distinction; the second person pronoun had separate singular/familiar and plural/formal forms with subject and object forms of both. In standard modern forms of English, all second person forms have been reduced to simply &quot;you&quot;. These forms are still retained (sometimes partially) in some dialects of Northern English, Scottish English, and in the Scots language, a Germanic language closely related to English which diverged from it during the Early Modern period.

==Other languages==

In some languages the &quot;direct&quot; object pronoun and the &quot;indirect&quot; object pronoun have separate forms. For example, in the Spanish object pronoun system, &quot;direct object&quot;: Lo mandaron a la escuela (They sent him to school) and &quot;indirect object&quot;: Le mandaron una carta (They sent him a letter). Other languages divide object pronouns into a larger variety of classes.
On the other hand, many languages, for example Persian, do not have distinct object pronouns: Man Farsi balad-am&quot; (I can speak Persian). Man ra mishenasad.&quot; (He knows me).

==History==
Object pronouns, in languages where they are distinguished from subject pronouns, are typically a vestige of an older case system. English, for example, once had an extensive declension system that specified distinct accusative and dative case &quot;forms&quot; for both nouns and pronouns. And after a preposition, a noun or pronoun could be in either of these cases, or in the genitive or instrumental cases. With the exception of the genitive (the &quot;apostrophe-s&quot; form), in nouns this system disappeared entirely, while in personal pronouns it collapsed into a single case, covering the roles of both accusative and dative, as well as all instances after a preposition. That is, the new oblique (object) case came to be used for the object of either a verb or a preposition, contrasting with the genitive, which links two nouns.

For a discussion of the use of historically object pronouns in subject position in English (e.g. &quot;Jay and me will arrive later&quot;), see the article on English personal pronouns.

<text>Khwārezmian (Khwarezmian: ; also transliterated Khwarazmian, Chorasmian, Khorezmian) is an extinct Eastern Iranian language closely related to Sogdian. The language was spoken in the area of Khwarezm (Chorasmia), centered in the lower Amu Darya south of the Aral Sea (the northern part of the modern Republic of Uzbekistan and the adjacent areas of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan).

Knowledge of Khwarezmian is limited to its Middle Iranian stage and, as with Sogdian, little is known of its ancient form. Based on the writings of Khwarezmian scholars Al-Biruni and Zamakhshari, the language was in use at least until the 13th century, when it was gradually replaced by Persian for the most part, as well as several dialects of Turkic.

Sources of Khwarezmian include astronomical terms used by al-Biruni, Zamakhshari&#x27;s Arabic–Persian–Khwarezmian dictionary and several legal texts that use Khwarezmian terms and quotations to explain certain legal concepts, most notably the Qunyat al-Munya of Mukhtār al-Zāhidī al-Ghazmīnī (d. 1259/60).

The noted scholar W.B. Henning was preparing a dictionary of Khwarezmian when he died, leaving it unfinished. A fragment of this dictionary was published posthumously by D.N. MacKenzie in 1971.

==Writing system==

Before the advance of Islam in Transoxiana (early 8th century), Khwarezmian was written in a script close to that of Sogdian and Pahlavi with its roots in the Imperial Aramaic script. From the few surviving examples of this script on coins and artifacts, it has been observed that written Khwarezmian included Aramaic logograms or ideograms, that is Aramaic words written to represent native spoken ones e.g.
𐿃𐾾𐿄 (ŠNT) for سرذ, &quot;sarδ&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, 𐾾𐿁𐿃𐾺 (NPŠY) for خداك, &quot;xudāk&quot;, &quot;self&quot; and 𐾽𐾼𐾻𐾰 (MLK&#x27;) for اى شاه, &quot;ī šah&quot;, &quot;the king&quot;.

After the advance of Islam, Khwarezmian was written using an adapted version of the Perso-Arabic alphabet with a few extra signs to reflect specific Khwarezmian sounds, such as the letter څ which represents /ts/ and /dz/, as in the traditional Pashto orthography.

===Unicode===

Khwarezmian script was added to the Unicode Standard in March, 2020 with the release of version 13.0.

The Unicode block for Khwarezmian, called Chorasmian, is U+10FB0–U+10FDF:

<doc id="503179" wikidata="Q7631398" url="?curid=503179" title="Subject pronoun">
<text>In linguistics, a subject pronoun is a personal pronoun that is used as the subject of a verb. Subject pronouns are usually in the nominative case for languages with a nominative–accusative alignment pattern. On the other hand, a language with an ergative-absolutive pattern usually has separate subject pronouns for transitive and intransitive verbs: an ergative case pronoun for transitive verbs and an absolutive case pronoun for intransitive verbs.

In English, the commonly used subject pronouns are &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot;. With the exception of &quot;you&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;one&quot; and &quot;what&quot;, and in informal speech &quot;who&quot;, the object pronouns are different: i.e. &quot;me,&quot; &quot;him,&quot; &quot;her,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; &quot;them&quot; and &quot;whom&quot; (see English personal pronouns).

In some cases, the subject pronoun is not used for the logical subject. For example, exceptional case marking (ECM) constructions involve the subject of a non-finite clause which appears in the object form (e.g., &quot;I want him to go&quot;.) In colloquial speech, a coordinated first person subject will often appear in the object form even in subject position (e.g., &quot;Me and James went to the store&quot;.) This is corrected so often that it has led to cases of hypercorrection, where the subject pronoun is used even in object position under coordination (e.g., &quot;Marie gave Susana and I a piece of cake.)

<doc id="503181" wikidata="Q1895627" url="?curid=503181" title="RAF Scampton">
<text>Royal Air Force Scampton or RAF Scampton (formerly ) is a former Royal Air Force station located adjacent to the A15 road near to the village of Scampton, Lincolnshire, and north-west of the city of Lincoln, England.

RAF Scampton stood on the site of a First World War Royal Flying Corps landing field, which had been called Brattleby. The station was closed and returned to agriculture following the First World War, and reactivated in the 1930s. It has provided an airfield for fighters in the First World War, bombers during the Second World War and V-force Avro Vulcans during the Cold War.

The station was temporarily closed in 1996, but subsequently re-opened to provide a home for the RAF Aerobatic Team the Red Arrows, and to private companies, temporarily, such as Hawker Hunter Aviation, for the maintenance and storage of aircraft.

In July 2018, the Ministry of Defence announced that Scampton would close and be sold, with all units relocated elsewhere. The station closed on 31 March 2023.

==History==

===First World War===
Home Defence Flight Station Brattleby (also known as Brattleby Cliff) was opened on the site of the current RAF Scampton in late 1916. The airfield was bounded to the east by Ermine Street, to the south by Pollyplatt Lane, to the west by Middle Street, and to the north by Aisthorpe House. The form of the airfield was very similar to that of Hackthorn Park to the north east, which is likely to have been created in the same way. In addition to field boundaries, a number of other features were demolished or used for the airfield, including Aisthorpe House and a farm complex to the east of the site.

The aerodrome covered consisting of a landing ground and six single-span end-opening General Service Flight Sheds arranged in pairs with their doors at 90° to the landing ground. Technical buildings were set out behind these, followed by domestic accommodation close to Ermine Street. These were subdivided into smaller groups depending on rank. Accommodation for women was based around a Women&#x27;s Hostel.

The first operational unit was A Flight, No. 33 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps, which flew the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b, defending against the Zeppelin threat. The site then developed into a training aerodrome, supporting No. 60 Training Squadron, followed by No. 81 and No. 11 Training Squadrons, flying the Sopwith Camel, Pup and Dolphin. The station was renamed as Scampton in 1917 following which it was designated as 34 Training Depot Station and continued with its operational programme until it was closed in April 1919.

All of the buildings on the airfield were temporary, even the hedgerows and trees which existed around the field boundaries were retained, so that between the wars the area was returned to its previous form. By 1920 all the buildings, including the hangars, had been removed.

===Inter-war period===
By 1936, the Royal Air Force Expansion Scheme had overseen a period of rapid increases both in terms of new squadrons and the development of new stations. The former Brattleby site was one of many earmarked under the expansion programme, situated between three villages; Aisthorpe, Brattleby and Scampton, with its main entrance situated on the A15 road &quot;(Ermine Street)&quot; heading north from Lincoln. The site was to be constructed to the latest specifications and on completion would form a fully equipped bomber station. From its reopening in August 1936, the station was known as Royal Air Force Station Scampton.

The station consisted of four large C-Type hangars with permanent brick-built technical and domestic buildings. The remaining aerodrome buildings (for technical activities and accommodation) were built in a compact layout behind the hangars, in an arrangement replicated across all of the expansion period airfields: Technical Area, Station Offices, Officers&#x27; Mess, Sergeants&#x27; Mess, Airmen&#x27;s&#x27; Quarters, Married Quarters, and Officers&#x27; Married Quarters. Roads were arranged either or perpendicular to Ermine Street &quot;(A15)&quot; with the Guardroom at 90° to the main entrance and the Station Headquarters facing Ermine Street. This resulted in the base occupying an area of .

As it developed, RAF Scampton made an increasingly dramatic imposition on the surrounding rural landscape, such as to the Lincolnshire Edge, a Jurassic limestone ridge, which forms the distinctive backbone of the county from Whitton on the Humber Estuary in the north, down to Grantham in the south. Along the top of the Edge, a series of airfields were developed, including RAF Waddington, RAF Cranwell and RAF Scampton.

Upon opening, No. 9 Squadron and No. 214 Squadron were the first residents of the station, arriving in October 1936, operating the Handley Page Heyford and Vickers Virginia. No. 9 Squadron stayed at Scampton until March 1938, No. 214 Squadron having departed for RAF Feltwell in April 1937. Another squadron which was stationed at the base was No. 148 Squadron formed from C Flt of No. 9 Squadron operating the Hawker Audax and later the Vickers Wellesley. The term of residence of No. 148 Squadron was brief being replaced by No. 49 Squadron and No. 83 Squadron in March 1938. At this time both No. 49 Squadron and No. 83 Squadron were operating the Hawker Hind, before re-equipping with the Handley Page Hampden.

===Second World War===

====1939–1942====
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Scampton transferred to No. 5 Group within RAF Bomber Command, playing host to the Hampdens of No. 49 Squadron and No. 83 Squadron. On 3 September 1939, six hours after the declaration of war, RAF Scampton launched the first offensive by the RAF when six Hampdens of No. 83 Squadron, led by (the then) Flying Officer Guy Gibson and three No. 49 Squadron Hampdens, one piloted by Flying Officer Roderick Learoyd, were despatched to conduct a sweep off Wilhelmshaven in Germany. Further operations involving Scampton&#x27;s squadrons concerned them with the hazardous task of low level minelaying (code named &#x27;Gardening&#x27;).

For a short time the station was home to the Avro Manchester, operated by No. 49 Squadron and No. 83 Squadron. This was a brief liaison, with the squadrons subsequently converting to the Avro Lancaster. Forming No. 83 Conversion Flight (CF) on 11 April 1942, which in turn was followed by No. 49 CF on 16 May, both squadrons were fully equipped with the Lancaster by the end of June. It was during this period that No. 83 Squadron took delivery of Lancaster Mk.I &quot;R5868&quot; which would one day become the Station&#x27;s gate guardian.

In turn both resident squadrons were then replaced at Scampton by No. 57 Squadron. The first departure was that of No. 83 Squadron which left in August 1942, transferring to RAF Wyton in order to become part of the fledgling Pathfinder Force. This departure resulted in No. 83 CF moving to RAF Wigsley, where it was disbanded into No. 1654 Heavy Conversion Unit. On 2 January 1943, No. 49 Squadron departed for RAF Fiskerton with No. 49 CU disbanding, subsequently becoming &#x27;C&#x27; Flight of No. 1661 Heavy Conversion Unit at RAF Waddington. By early January 1943 this left No. 57 Squadron as the sole occupier of the base.
====1943–1945====
Following the development of the &quot;Upkeep&quot; bouncing bomb, No. 617 Squadron, originally referred to as &quot;Squadron X&quot;, was formed at Scampton in order to carry out the proposed raid, codenamed Operation Chastise. More commonly referred to as the &quot;Dambusters Raid&quot;, the raid would go down as the most famous and widely remembered in the history of the RAF.

On the night of 16–17 May 1943, No. 617 Squadron despatched nineteen Lancasters from Scampton. Led by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, the main bulk of the squadron attacked the Sorpe, Eder and Möhne dams with an additional aircraft tasked to perform an attack on the Schwelm Dam. Both the Eder and Möhne dams were breached, however eight of the Lancasters despatched failed to return and fifty-three aircrew were lost. Following the raid Wing Commander Gibson was awarded the Victoria Cross, becoming Scampton&#x27;s third recipient of the award. On the day of the raid, Wing Commander Gibson&#x27;s dog, Nigger, was run over and killed on the A15 outside the entrance to the base. He was buried later that night, his grave situated outside Gibson&#x27;s office at No. 3 Hangar.
In July 1943, No. 617 Squadron was again involved in a precision operation, when twelve aircraft of the squadron took off from Scampton to attack targets in Northern Italy, following which the aircraft continued on to North Africa. The operation met little opposition but the targets were obscured by valley haze and they were not destroyed. The twelve crews returned to Scampton on 25 July from North Africa after bombing Leghorn docks on the return journey. Later in the month nine aircraft took off from Scampton to drop leaflets on Milan, Bologna, Genoa and Turin in Italy. All aircraft completed the mission and landed safely in Blida, Algeria.

At the end of August 1943, No. 57 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron moved to RAF East Kirkby and RAF Coningsby respectively, so that Scampton&#x27;s runways could be upgraded. With the increased all up weight of the Lancaster it was apparent that the load bearing of hardened runways would be required. The airfield closed at the end of August 1943 for the work to take place re-opening in October 1944. Three concrete runways were laid out. The three runways available were: 05/23 at , 01/19 at and 11/29 at . A total of eleven loop hard-standings were laid down along the perimeter track to replace those lost or isolated by the construction. The work also saw new bomb stores constructed on land north of the north-west corner of the airfield. The personnel at Scampton at this time was given as 1,844 males and 268 females. On completion of the required work the area of land which the base occupied had now increased to .

Following the work control of the station passed from No. 5 Group to No. 1 Group with a new arrival following the upgrade being No. 1690 Bomber Defence Training Flight (BDTF) which arrived on 13 July 1944. The BDTF operated the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane and Miles Martinet, the flight undertaking fighter affiliation against bombers. This unit stayed at the station until September 1944, when it moved to RAF Metheringham. It was replaced by No. 1687 BDTF, which arrived in early December 1944, and departed for RAF Hemswell in April 1945. Two Lancaster squadrons, No. 153 Squadron, and later No. 625 Squadron, of No. 1 Group also arrived at Scampton.

The last bombing mission of the Second World War launched from RAF Scampton was on 25 April 1945, when aircraft from No. 153 Squadron and No. 625 Squadron were despatched as part of the Bombing of Obersalzberg. During the war RAF Scampton lost a total of 551 aircrew and 266 aircraft. Of these 155 were Hampdens and fifteen Manchesters.

===Post-Second World War===
Following the end of hostilities No. 153 Squadron disbanded on 28 September 1945, followed by No. 625 Squadron on 7 October. The station continued to operate the Lancaster when No. 100 Squadron arrived in December 1945. They were to be the last Lancaster squadron on the station, departing for RAF Lindholme in May 1946. Returning to their former home in December 1945, No. 57 Squadron introduced the Avro Lincoln to the station.

From July 1948, Scampton was home to the 28th Bombardment Group of the United States Air Force (USAF), operating the Boeing B-29 Superfortresses as part of a network of Emergency War Plan Airfields. With its main runway less than in length and a chronic shortage of suitable hardstandings, Scampton was far from ideal as a base for the thirty USAF and RAF B-29 Superfortresses, the latter&#x27;s known as &quot;Washington B.1&quot;. In January 1949, as circumstances changed, the USAF squadrons were withdrawn and RAF Scampton was handed back to the RAF.

===Cold War===

====1950s====
During this period RAF Scampton was supporting four English Electric Canberra squadrons; No. 10 Squadron, No. 18 Squadron, No. 21 Squadron and No. 27 Squadron. The Canberras moved out in 1955 when the station was earmarked as a V-bomber base, in the case of Scampton, the Avro Vulcan. This required extensive new ground facilities, including a high security area for the storage and maintenance of nuclear weapons and heavy-duty hardstandings for the aircraft.
The first nuclear weapons to be delivered to Scampton arrived during 1958 and comprised twenty kiloton (20kt) atomic bombs given the Rainbow Code, Blue Danube. They were replaced by the smaller Yellow Sun Stage 1 (Mk.1) which were the first of the UK&#x27;s operational thermonuclear weapons. The development of the stand-off nuclear missile Blue Steel required the construction of new specialist buildings: the Missile Servicing and Storage Building (MSSB) which was erected between the main hangars and the airfield, and the highly volatile High Test Peroxide (HTP) and kerosene fuel storage buildings which were located at some distance from the MSSB.

Additional structures and parts of the layout were also altered. In particular the runway was rearranged to a NE/SW (current designation alignment 04/22) and extended to . This caused the runway to project beyond the north east corner of the base and required the re-routing of Ermine Street (A15), the most noticeable artificial landscape feature in the area and the historic boundary for such elements as parish boundaries and field systems. Trees along the former tree-lined avenue to Hackthorn Park were also removed between the old line of Ermine Street and the end of the runway. The eastward bulge in the A15 road can still be seen north of Lincoln.
During the Cold War, the airfield developed its current form, imposing on the landscape in a much more spectacular way. Its extent was no longer bounded by existing field boundaries, but by the shape required for the runway extension. This caused the south-west and north-west corners of the base to jut out from the earlier rectangular plan. Areas of hard standing with associated Operational Readiness Platforms (ORPs) were also provided as were technical buildings. The Unit Storage buildings to the far north of the site were constructed for storage and maintenance of nuclear bombs. Upon the introduction of the Blue Steel stand-off missile, new buildings were constructed just to the north-east of the hangars, to develop, maintain and fuel the missiles. A new control tower was constructed close to these buildings to provide a view of the newly expanded runway.

The work undertaken increased the land area of the station to acres. On completion No. 617 Squadron returned to their former home, re-forming in May 1958.

==== 1960s–1980s ====
In October 1960, No. 83 Squadron arrived at Scampton from RAF Waddington and equipped with the Vulcan B.2. Together with No. 27 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron, who by this time had also taken delivery of the Vulcan, the &quot;Scampton Wing&quot; was formed, the aircraft equipped with the Blue Steel stand-off missile.

On 30 June 1968, Blue Steel operations at Scampton were terminated, as the Royal Navy, with the submarine launched Polaris missile, assumed responsibility for the UK nuclear deterrent. Scampton squadrons were assigned to the tactical nuclear and conventional bombing roles. This led to the disbandment of No. 83 Squadron in August 1969, however in December 1969 No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit moved to RAF Scampton from RAF Finningley.
Part of the post-war development and upgrading of the station, in common with many other RAF stations at the time, saw the establishment of a primary school for the children of those personnel stationed on the base. Located to the south of the base entrance, and adjacent to the eastern perimeter fence, the current school was built in 1961 and replaced the makeshift schooling which had been provided in the Officer&#x27;s Mess since 1951. The official opening of the school took place on 24 November 1961, and the first children attended the school in January 1962. The buildings are typical of small primary schools built in the 1960s, with a flat roof, large windows and uniformly one storey high. There are several prefabricated extensions which present an informal building layout.

Individual unit allocations were re-introduced in 1971, and throughout the decade Scampton continued to be home to No. 27 Squadron, No. 617 Squadron and No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit, with No. 35 Squadron joining them from RAF Akrotiri in 1975.

With disbandment of No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit and the cessation of No. 617 Squadron&#x27;s Vulcan operations in 1981, followed by the cessation of Vulcan flying at Scampton by No. 27 Squadron and No. 35 Squadron in 1982, Scampton was transferred to RAF Support Command and became home to the Central Flying School (CFS) in 1983. This role for the station saw the CFS operating such aircraft as the BAC Jet Provost, Scottish Aviation Bulldog and the Short Tucano, sharing the air space with the Hawker Siddeley Hawks of the Red Arrows. A further addition to the complement of the station occurred in 1984 with the arrival of the Tornado Radar Repair Unit. The first Jet Provost retired during March 1988 due to the replacement of the type by the Short Tucano T.1.

===Post-Cold War===
====1990s====
In August 1990, RAF Scampton became home to the Joint Arms Control Implementation Group, a joint service organisation responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Control of Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, Treaty on Open Skies and the Vienna Document.

In 1996, Scampton was mothballed under the Front Line First programme, with the CFS moving to RAF Cranwell. The decision was initially taken to close the base completely along with RAF Finningley, this being confirmed by Nicholas Soames MP in a statement to the House of Commons on 25 March 1995. This would end the Red Arrows 12 year residency (1983 to 1995), and began a 6 year period of &quot;Care &amp; Maintenance&quot; inactivity with the base largely unused.

====2000s and the second closure====
Opposition to the planned closure was strong and a group was formed called &quot;Save our Scampton&quot; (SOS), backed by the &quot;Lincolnshire Echo,&quot; the County Council and the MP for Gainsborough and Horncastle, Edward Leigh. One plan put forward for the base following its proposed redundancy involved turning the site into a prison, but this plan was not continued with.

The Red Arrows, though, continued to train in the airspace surrounding the airfield (Restricted Zone EG R313) and accommodation at Scampton continued to be used as overflow from RAF Waddington. During this intervening period 110 of the post-war non-commissioned officer married quarters were sold to Welbeck Estate Group who had previously acquired technical and domestic sites at RAF Hemswell, married quarters at RAF Faldingworth and RAF Strike Command Headquarters at RAF Bawtry.

RAF Scampton received the Freedom of Lincoln on 14 May 1993.

=== 21st century ===
Following concerns over capacity and flight safety at RAF Cranwell, the then current home of the Red Arrows, several other training and flying squadrons and units, the decision was taken to remove RAF Scampton from &quot;Care &amp; Maintenance&quot; status and reopen the base, and initially return the Red Arrows, as well as introduce and relocate over time other functions and units, heightening the importance and presence of this historic base. The great influx in personnel and units into Scampton demanded a degree of upgrades and modernisation to much of the office and domestic housing, but during in-depth investigations a further report by the Defence Estates Organisation was published, citing the original cost estimate had more than doubled to £4.5Bn as a result of the substantial amount of remedial work needed as significant amount of the facilities being unused since the reopening in 2001, and some since the mid 1980s, forcing a halt to the overall scheme.

From January 2001 until early 2023, two years after the UK Ministry of Defence announced that RAF Scampton would permanently close as an RAF base, the Red Arrows were the sole RAF Flying unit stationed there, although a private military aviation contractor, Hawker Hunter Aviation, also shared the airfield. Immediately prior to closure, the Red Arrows relocated to RAF Waddington, and HHA relocated to RAF Leeming.

In 2005 Scampton was again placed under the control of RAF Strike Command, becoming home to the UK Air Surveillance and Control System (ASACS) Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) and Mobile Meteorological Unit (MMU). The No.1 Air Control Centre (No.1 ACC) deployed to Afghanistan in 2006 as part of Operation Herrick, the deployment lasting until 2009.

By 2008, the future once again looked uncertain for Scampton. A decision was taken by the then Labour Government that the base would be &quot;downsized&quot;, the Red Arrows would move to RAF Waddington by July 2011 and ASACS would also be relocated from the base taking up residence at RAF Coningsby by 2014. However the Strategic Defence Spending Review and operations in Libya meant the plan was suspended with the decision put on hold pending a further review in 2011. The review concluded that keeping the Red Arrows at Scampton was the best way for them to operate, without affecting other operational flying bases.

In July 2018, the Ministry of Defence announced that Scampton would close and then be sold off with all remaining units relocated to other RAF bases by 2022. In May 2020, it was announced that the Red Arrows would move to RAF Waddington, and No. 1 ACC to RAF Boulmer in Northumberland.

In April 2022, the Aviation Medicine Flight, part of the RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine relocated to Scampton from MOD Boscombe Down after retiring their BAE Systems Hawk T1 aircraft. The moves allowed the flight to continue its work using Hawks operated by the Red Arrows.

On 6 September 2022 a fly past of the Red Arrows and Avro Lancaster bomber aircraft took place in anticipation of the closure of the base in December 2022. During October 2022 the Red Arrows left the base for RAF Waddington. The station closed on 31 March 2023.

In December 2023 challenges against government plans to use the base to house asylum seekers were dismissed at the High Court. West Lindsey District Council had claimed the government&#x27;s plans were unlawful but judge Mrs Justice Thornton dismissed the claims for a judicial review saying that the government&#x27;s use of emergency powers to change the legal purpose of the land to house asylum seekers was appropriate &quot;given its argument that they could become destitute if more accommodation was not found beyond the use of hotels.&quot; Sir Edward Leigh, the MP for Gainsborough, said he was &quot;disappointed by the result.&quot; During September 2024, it was announced that the plans have been scrapped.

==Role and operations==

RAF Scampton was home to the Control and Reporting Centre Scampton, and the Mobile Meteorological Unit.

The Red Arrows were previously based here and fell under No. 22 Group, although RAF Scampton is actually administered by No. 1 Group. The reason for this being that No. 1 Air Control Centre is a No. 1 Group air defence radar unit, with its permanent operations room, Control and Reporting Centre Scampton, providing assistance to the coverage at RAF Boulmer. RAF Scampton&#x27;s primary responsibility is training, but it can also provide defence coverage following any technical disruptions at RAF Boulmer. Another responsibility of the station is the provision of deployable command and control capability using containerised equipment that can be delivered worldwide, thereby delivering similar capability to that of the permanent Control and Reporting Centres. No. 1 ACC provides the main operational unit for fighter controllers and aerospace systems operators in the RAF. Operators usually train at the Control and Reporting Centres of Boulmer and Scampton before putting their training into practice at No. 1 ACC or on the Boeing E-3D Sentry.

Until the closing of RAF Kirton in Lindsey, Scampton had administrative control over the satellite site, fifteen miles to the north.

In 2015, part of the accommodation facilities at Scampton underwent significant refurbishment, particularly those of Gibson Barracks. The improvements consisted of replacement of windows, refurbishment and repair of external concrete areas and provision of new escape stairs. The barracks had lain unused for over twenty years, and as a consequence of the neglect had fallen into a state of disrepair. The building was converted into teaching space in the 1980s, but with the subsequent lack of investment on the station the block was allowed to fall into disuse. Following a re-examination of the viability of the base undertaken following the closure of RAF Kirton in Lindsey and the resulting transfer of personnel, as well as the realisation by English Heritage of the importance of the structure and its association with the Dams Raid, it was decided to convert the block back to residential use. Although the building is not listed, it is situated within a site of significant heritage value due to its links to Operation Chastise. The accommodation consists of 48 bedrooms with communal facilities.

=== Met Office meteorological data ===
The Mobile Meteorological Unit was staffed by full-time RAF reserve officers as part of the civilian Meteorological Office, aiding in providing weather and climate information for local forecasts. The unit maintains and repairs equipment for the support of out of area flying operations.

In a typical year at RAF Scampton, the warmest day reaches a high temperature of at least , whereas the coldest day should always reach a low of .

The record high at Scampton peaked at in the afternoon of 19 July 2022 during the 2022 United Kingdom heat wave, beating not only the previous local record of from a three-day heatwave on 26 July 2019, but also the former national record of , also from July 2019.

The absolute minimum temperature of was recorded on 7 December 2010, during the record-breaking winter of 2010–11 in Great Britain and Ireland. In a year, 48.98 nights register an air frost.

The length of the day varies extremely over the course of the year at Scampton. The shortest day may have 7 hours and 30 minutes of daylight, and the longest as much as 17 hours of daylight. The earliest sunrise is at around 4:30 am in June, and the latest sunrise is at 8:30 am in December. The earliest sunset is at 3:30 pm in December, and the latest is at 9:30 pm in June. Daylight saving time (DST) is observed at Scampton, starting in the spring, lasting about 7 months, and ending in the autumn.

Winters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant.
== RAF Scampton Victoria Cross recipients ==
During the station&#x27;s history, three personnel based at RAF Scampton have been recipients of the Victoria Cross.

=== Roderick &quot;Babe&quot; Learoyd ===


On 12 August 1940, No. 83 Squadron&#x27;s aircraft were part of a raid against the Dortmund-Ems Canal. Two aircraft had been lost due to anti-aircraft fire prior to Wing Commander Roderick &#x27;Babe&#x27; Learoyd making his attack, which would involve an attack at low level. During his attack, Learoyd&#x27;s aircraft was caught in the searchlights, taking two hits in one wing. Despite this Learoyd was still able to provide his bomb aimer with a steady platform in order to deliver his bombs. Learoyd then nursed the Hampden back to England, arriving in the vicinity of Scampton at 02:00. Although the aircraft was flyable, its hydraulic systems had been damaged and the wing flaps were inoperable. The undercarriage indicators had also failed and rather than risk a landing in the dark, Learoyd circled for three hours before making a landing at first light. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his courage, skill and determination.

=== John Hannah ===

Wireless Operator/Air Gunner Flight Sergeant John Hannah was also a member of No. 83 Squadron. On 15 September 1940 his aircraft was involved in a raid on a target near Antwerp during which the Hampden received a hit in the bomb bay, leading to an explosion and serious fire. Both Hannah&#x27;s position and that of the rear gunner were engulfed in fire, and although the rear gunner had bailed out, Hannah elected to remain at his post, fighting the fire with extinguishers, and when these expired his log book.

He successfully prevented the fire from reaching the aircraft&#x27;s ruptured fuel tanks, despite ammunition exploding and the floor beneath him melting. Although severely burned, Hannah forced his way forward to the navigator&#x27;s station, only to find the navigator had also baled out. He then passed the navigation logs and charts to the pilot and assisted him in navigating the Hampden back to Scampton.

=== Guy Gibson ===

On the night of 16–17 May 1943, Wing Commander Gibson led No. 617 Squadron on the raids against the Ruhr Dams, Operation Chastise. The task was fraught with danger and difficulty. Gibson personally made the initial attack on the Möhne Dam. Descending to within a few feet of the water and taking the full brunt of the anti-aircraft defences, he delivered his attack with great accuracy.

Afterwards he circled very low for 30 minutes, drawing the enemy fire on himself in order to leave as free a run as possible to the following aircraft which were attacking the dam in turn. Wing Commander Gibson then led the remainder of his force to the Eder Dam where, with complete disregard for his own safety, he repeated his tactics and once more drew on himself the enemy fire so that the attack could be successfully developed.

==Scampton Airshow==
On 19 February 2016, an announcement was made concerning plans for the creation of an airshow to take place at Scampton in 2017.

In the wake of the decision to discontinue with a display at RAF Waddington following the 2014 airshow, there was a high degree of dissatisfaction regarding the announcement. The airshow had become one of the leading attractions in the UK during the summer months, the 2014 airshow at Waddington witnessed numbers in the region of 135,000 attending the display weekend, raising approximately £260,000 for Service and local charities.

Following on from the announcement in February 2016 of the station staging an airshow in 2017, it was announced that the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, organisers of the Royal International Air Tattoo had agreed to organise a new event at Scampton. However, the requirements for the upgrading of the base&#x27;s infrastructure so as to be able to stage such an event meant that no airshow was able to take place until 2017.

During the late spring of 2016, preparations continued for the organisation of the event and an official announcement was made at the Station Commander&#x27;s Reception on 26 May. The dates for the airshow were confirmed on 10 November, been set for 9–10 September 2017.

===2017===
The first airshow to be held at RAF Scampton since 1991 saw participation of 104 aircraft, with 41 taking part in the flying displays and 63 forming the static line-up. Aircraft types ranged from a display by a vintage Avro Anson to a modern Typhoon, with visitor numbers in the region of 50,000. Guests of honour at the event were Battle of Britain veteran Terry Clark, and former Scampton resident Johnny Johnson.

===2018===
On 14 December 2017, the organisers of the Scampton Airshow issued a statement with regard to the 2018 event. The statement read that following the 2017 airshow the organisers required time to reflect on certain issues and to look at how the airshow could be improved. In view of this, the statement continued that there were still areas of the event which required improvement and consequently there would be no running of the Scampton Airshow in 2018. The statement did however conclude that the organisers, following the review, intend to run an improved Scampton Airshow in 2019.

== Heritage ==

=== Station badge and motto ===
RAF Scampton&#x27;s badge, awarded in December 1958, features a gold coloured long-bow and arrow against the backdrop an azure coloured roundel. The roundel represents the RAF, whilst the bow and arrow form a topographical representation of the station. The arrow acts as the lengthened runway; the bow-string is the former route of Ermine Street located near the station; and the bow the re-aligned road required to accommodate the extended runway.

The station&#x27;s motto () is in Latin and translates as &quot;An armed man is not attacked&quot;.

=== Archaeology ===
The remnants of a Roman Villa are situated to the south-west of RAF Scampton. Excavation of the site and its subsequent documentation were undertaken for Channel 4 television&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; programme.

===Dambusters commemorations===
1991

In May 1991, Scampton was the venue for a BBC broadcast of &quot;Friday Night is Music Night,&quot; set to coincide with the anniversary of the Dambusters Raid. The transmission was from No. 1 Hangar and of added interest was the arrival of a British Airways Boeing 747-400 &quot;(G-BNLT)&quot;. The aircraft, a new addition to the British Airways fleet, had been named &quot;City of Lincoln&quot; in a ceremony held at RAF Coningsby after which it was flown to RAF Scampton. &quot;City of Lincoln&quot; is the same name as that bestowed on Lancaster &quot;PA474&quot; of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) and both aircraft featured in the show, the BBMF&#x27;s Lancaster in No. 1 Hangar forming the focal point of the concert. The Boeing 747 was parked on Echo Dispersal and was made available for members of the audience to visit.

1993

A special commemorative BBC television broadcast of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; marking the 50th anniversary of Operation Chastise was staged at Scampton in 1993, in which Boeing 747-400 &quot;City of Lincoln&quot; returned to the base. Presented by Sally Magnusson, the event was attended by 2,500 invited guests, including several veterans of the raid as well as Richard Todd.

2013

Marking the 70th anniversary of the raid in 2013, the BBC again featured a programme from Scampton, hosted by Dan Snow. Attended by Les Munro and &quot;Johnny&quot; Johnson, the telecast featured the Lancaster of the BBMF as well as two Panavia Tornados of No. 617 Squadron.

In addition there was also a broadcast by BBC Radio 2 of The Chris Evans Breakfast Show in which Evans conducted interviews with various station personnel and current members of No. 617 Squadron. Following the show Evans boarded Lancaster &quot;PA474&quot; of the BBMF and flew from Scampton to Biggin Hill which was the venue for a special edition of &quot;Friday Night is Music Night&quot; as part of the commemoration.

===Gate guardians===
In all there have been three gate guardians at RAF Scampton during the station&#x27;s history.

====Lancaster R5868 &quot;Q-Queenie/S-Sugar&quot;====
The first was Avro Lancaster &quot;S-Sugar&quot; along with the large Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs which the type had carried. It was placed on display at the main gate of Scampton in No. 467 Squadron markings in 1960. With the arrival of 83 Squadron at Scampton in October 1960, it was noted that &quot;S-Sugar&quot; had strong links to the squadron. It transpired that the aircraft had originally served at Scampton with No. 83 Squadron and was given the squadron code OL-Q &quot;(Q-Queenie)&quot;. When No. 83 Squadron converted to the Lancaster Mk.III in September 1943, Lancaster &quot;Q-Queenie&quot; was transferred to No. 467 Squadron who were then based at RAF Bottesford. The aircraft was subsequently re-coded PO-S &quot;(S-Sugar)&quot;.

Lancaster &quot;R5868&quot; was dismantled at Scampton in November 1970, by personnel from No. 71 Maintenance Unit. It was removed and is now on permanent exhibition at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon.

====Lancaster &quot;NX611&quot; &quot;Just Jane&quot;====
The next gate guardian was another restored Lancaster, repatriated from a French island in the South Pacific. This later Lancaster, &quot;Just Jane NX611&quot;, is now at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre at the former RAF East Kirkby.

====Hawk &quot;XX306&quot;====
The current gate guardian at Scampton is a former Red Arrows Hawk T.1 &quot;XX306&quot;. Positioned in front of the Station Headquarters, it was unveiled by the then Station Commander Wing Commander Michael Harrop during a ceremony on 12 October 2015.

The aircraft was constructed at BAe Dunsfold and handed over to the RAF on 23 May 1980. The jet spent two months at RAF Valley before flying to RAF Kemble (the Red Arrows&#x27; previous home) and joined the Squadron on 3 July 1980, being one of the first of its type operated by the Red Arrows following their conversion from the Folland Gnat at the end of the 1979 display season.

During its operational life &quot;XX306&quot; amassed a total flying time of 7,378hrs 15 mins accumulating 13,007 landings. It was retired from the aerobatic team on 20 October 2012, having last been used in a display on 26 September of that year.

===RAF Scampton Heritage Centre===
RAF Scampton was home to a heritage centre, detailing the station&#x27;s history and displaying several hundred artefacts including a Blue Steel Missile. More ambitious plans were put forward in 2013 to turn part of RAF Scampton into a major tourist attraction. This project was driven by Lincolnshire County Council. It had been estimated that the total investment required for the complete plan would be £80 million, of that total £40 million would be required to complete the first phase, which concerned two hangars and an exhibition hall. Such amounts would have required substantial monetary grants from the National Lottery in order for it to succeed.The plans would have converted two of the station&#x27;s four hangars into exhibition halls and the Officer&#x27;s Mess into a hotel. Council officials held talks with the RAF and the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, which managed the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s estate, regarding the proposals which estimated the creation of 100 jobs locally and annual visitor numbers in the region of 200,000.

An independent study commissioned by Lincolnshire County Council in October 2013, concluded that the proposal was viable and had the potential to succeed.

Exhibitions would focus on the Red Arrows, aviation in the First and Second World Wars, the Cold War as well as Lincolnshire&#x27;s aviation engineering heritage and the Dambusters Raid. It was hoped the project would secure the future of the station and complement the proposals to establish an air show at Scampton. It was hoped that the facility would have been opened by 2018 in order to mark the centenary of the creation of the RAF. In July 2020 campaigners were hoping to establish a charitable trust to raise funds for the scheme.

<text>Than is a grammatical particle analyzed as both a conjunction and a preposition in the English language. It introduces a comparison and is associated with comparatives and with words such as , , and . Typically, it measures the force of an adjective or similar description between two predicates.

==Usage==

===Case of pronouns following &quot;than&quot;===
According to the view of many English-language prescriptivists, including influential 18th-century grammarian Robert Lowth, &quot;than&quot; is exclusively a conjunction and therefore takes either nominative (or subjective) or oblique (or objective) pronouns, depending on context, rather than exclusively oblique pronouns as prepositions do. This rule is broken as often as it is observed. For instance, William Shakespeare&#x27;s 1600 play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; has an instance of an oblique pronoun following &quot;than&quot; where the nominative is also possible:
:&quot;A man no mightier than thyself or me...&quot;

Likewise, Samuel Johnson wrote:
:&quot;No man had ever more discernment than him, in finding out the ridiculous.&quot;

In simple comparisons in contemporary English, &quot;than&quot; often takes an oblique pronoun, which lexicographers and usage commentators regard as prepositional use and as standard.

The case of a pronoun following &quot;than&quot; can be determined by context. For example:
* &quot;You are a better swimmer than she.&quot;
** The sentence is equivalent to &quot;You are a better swimmer than she is.&quot;
* &quot;They like you more than her.&quot;
** The sentence is equivalent to &quot;They like you more than they like her.&quot;
** The sentence &quot;They like you more than she&quot; may instead mean &quot;They like you more than she likes you.&quot;

===Confusion between &quot;than&quot; and &quot;then&quot;===
In writing, &quot;than&quot; and &quot;then&quot; are often erroneously interchanged. In standard English, &quot;then&quot; refers to time or consequence, while &quot;than&quot; is used in comparisons.

<doc id="503189" wikidata="Q157548" url="?curid=503189" title="War of the Bavarian Succession">
<text>The War of the Bavarian Succession (; 3 July 1778 – 13 May 1779) was a dispute between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and an alliance of Saxony and Prussia over succession to the Electorate of Bavaria after the extinction of the Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach. The Habsburgs sought to acquire Bavaria, and the alliance opposed them, favoring another branch of the Wittelsbachs. Both sides mobilized large armies, but the only fighting in the war was a few minor skirmishes. However, thousands of soldiers died from disease and starvation, earning the conflict the name &quot;Kartoffelkrieg&quot; (Potato War) in Prussia and Saxony; in Habsburg Austria, it was sometimes called the &quot;Zwetschgenrummel&quot; (Plum Fuss).

On 30 December 1777, Maximilian III Joseph, the last of the junior Wittelsbach line, died of smallpox, leaving no children. Charles Theodore, a scion of a senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach, held the closest claim of kinship, but he also had no legitimate children to succeed him. His cousin, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore&#x27;s heir presumptive. Across Bavaria&#x27;s southern border, Emperor Joseph II coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Maximilian Joseph&#x27;s sister Maria Josepha in 1765 to strengthen any claim he could extend. His agreement with the heir, Charles Theodore, to partition the territory neglected any claims of the heir presumptive, Charles August.

Acquiring territory in the German-speaking states was an essential part of Joseph&#x27;s policy to expand his family&#x27;s influence in Central Europe. For King Frederick the Great of Prussia, Joseph&#x27;s claim threatened Prussian influence in German politics, but he questioned whether he should preserve the status quo through war, diplomacy, or trade. Empress Maria Theresa, Joseph&#x27;s mother and co-ruler, considered any conflict over the Bavarian electorate not worth bloodshed, and neither she nor Frederick saw any point in pursuing hostilities. Joseph would not drop his claim despite his mother&#x27;s contrary insistence. Elector Frederick August III of Saxony wanted to preserve the territorial integrity of Bavaria for his brother-in-law, Charles August, and had no interest in seeing the Habsburgs acquire additional territory on his southern and western borders. Despite his dislike of Prussia, which had been Saxony&#x27;s enemy in two previous wars, Charles August sought the support of Frederick, who was happy to challenge the Habsburgs. France became involved to maintain the balance of power. Finally, Empress Catherine the Great of Russia&#x27;s threat to intervene on the side of Prussia with fifty thousand Russian troops forced Joseph to reconsider his position. With Catherine&#x27;s assistance, he and Frederick negotiated a solution to the problem of the Bavarian succession with the Treaty of Teschen, signed on 13 May 1779.

For some historians, the War of the Bavarian Succession was the last of the old-style cabinet wars of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; era, in which troops maneuvered while diplomats traveled between capitals to resolve their monarchs&#x27; complaints. The subsequent French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars differed in scope, strategy, organization, and tactics.

==Background==

In 1713, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI established a line of succession that gave precedence to his own daughters over the daughters of his deceased older brother, Emperor Joseph I. To protect the Habsburg inheritance, he coerced, cajoled, and persuaded the crowned heads of Europe to accept the Pragmatic Sanction. In this agreement, they acknowledged any of his legitimate daughters as the rightful queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and archduchess of Austria—a break from the tradition of agnatic primogeniture.

Holy Roman emperors had been elected from the House of Habsburg for most of the previous three centuries. Charles VI arranged a marriage of his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, to Francis III of Lorraine. Francis relinquished the Duchy of Lorraine neighbouring France in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to make himself a more appealing candidate for eventual election as emperor. On paper, many heads of state and, most importantly, the rulers of the German states of the Holy Roman Empire, accepted the Pragmatic Sanction and the idea of Francis as the next emperor. Two key exceptions, the Electorate of Bavaria and the Electorate of Saxony, held important electoral votes and could impede or even block Francis&#x27; election. When Charles died in 1740, Maria Theresa had to fight for her family&#x27;s entitlements in Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and her husband faced competition in his election as the Holy Roman emperor.
Charles Albert, Prince-elector and Duke of Bavaria, claimed the German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a son-in-law of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI&#x27;s legitimate imperial successor. If women were going to inherit, he claimed, then his family should have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, was the daughter of Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles Albert of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph&#x27;s female children, rather than to the daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain, and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria&#x27;s claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.

Charles Albert of Bavaria needed military assistance to take the imperial title by force, which he secured the Treaty of Nymphenburg (July 1741). During the subsequent War of the Austrian Succession, he successfully captured Prague, where he was crowned King of Bohemia. He invaded Upper Austria, planning to capture Vienna, but diplomatic exigencies complicated his plans. His French allies redirected their troops into Bohemia, where Frederick the Great, himself newly King of Prussia, had taken advantage of the chaos in Austria and Bavaria to annex Silesia.

Charles Albert&#x27;s military options disappeared with the French. Adopting a new plan, he subverted the imperial election. He sold the County of Glatz to Prussia for a reduced price in exchange for Frederick&#x27;s electoral vote. Charles&#x27;s brother, Klemens August of Bavaria, archbishop and prince-elector of the Electorate of Cologne, voted for him in the imperial election and personally crowned him on 12 February 1742 in the traditional ceremony in Frankfurt am Main. The next day, the new Charles VII&#x27;s Bavarian capital of Munich capitulated to the Austrians to avoid being plundered by Maria Theresa&#x27;s troops. In the following weeks, her army overran most of Charles&#x27;s territories, occupied Bavaria, and barred him from his ancestral lands and from Bohemia.

Charles VII spent most of his three-year reign as emperor residing in Frankfurt while Maria Theresa battled Prussia for her patrimony in Bohemia and Hungary. Frederick could not secure Bohemia for Charles, but he did manage to push the Austrians out of Bavaria. For the last three months of his short reign, the gout-ridden Charles lived in Munich, where he died in January 1745. His son, Maximilian III Joseph (known as Max Joseph) inherited his father&#x27;s electoral dignities but not his imperial ambition. With the Peace of Füssen (22 April 1745), Max Joseph promised to vote for Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa&#x27;s husband, in the pending imperial election. He also acknowledged the Pragmatic Sanction. In return, he obtained the restitution of his family&#x27;s electoral position and territories. For his subjects, his negotiations ended five years of warfare and brought a generation of peace and relative prosperity that began with his father&#x27;s death in 1745 and ended with his own in 1777.

As the Duke of Bavaria, Max Joseph was the prince of one of the largest states in the German-speaking portion of the Holy Roman Empire. As a prince-elector, he stood in the highest rank of the Empire, with broad legal, economic, and judicial rights. As an elector, he was one of the men who selected the Holy Roman Emperor from a group of candidates. He was the son of one Holy Roman Emperor (Charles VII), and the grandson of another (Joseph I). When he died of smallpox on 30 December 1777, he left no children to succeed him and several ambitious men prepared to carve his patrimony into pieces.

==Contenders==
===The Heir===
The Sulzbach branch of the Wittelsbach family inherited the Electorate of Bavaria. In this line, the 55-year-old Charles IV Theodore, the Duke of Berg-Jülich, held the first claim. Unfortunately for Charles Theodore, he was already the Elector Palatine. By the terms of the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, he had to cede the Palatine electorate to his own heir before he could claim the Bavarian electorate. He was not eager to do so, even though Bavaria was larger and more important. He preferred living in the Palatinate, with its salubrious climate and compatible social scene. He patronized the arts, and had developed in Mannheim, his capital city, an array of theaters and museums at tremendous cost to his subjects. He hosted Voltaire at one of his many palaces. During the visit, he had enticed Voltaire&#x27;s secretary, the Florentine noble Cosimo Alessandro Collini (1727–1806), into his own employment, considered a coup in some of the Enlightenment circles. Thomas Carlyle referred to Charles Theodore as a &quot;poor idle creature, of purely egoistical, ornamental, dilettante nature; sunk in theatricals, [and] bastard children&quot;. The French foreign minister Vergennes, who knew him, described Charles Theodore&#x27;s foibles more forcefully:
:Although by nature intelligent, he [Charles Theodore] has never succeeded in ruling by himself; he has always been governed by his ministers or by his father-confessor or (for a time) by the electress [his wife]. This conduct has increased his natural weakness and apathy to such a degree that for a long time he has had no opinions save those inspired in him by his entourage. The void which this indolence has left in his soul is filled with the amusements of the hunt and of music and by secret liaisons, for which &quot;His Electoral Majesty&quot; has at all times had a particular penchant.
The Electress had provided him with a son, who had immediately died, but Charles Theodore&#x27;s &quot;particular penchant&quot; for secret liaisons, most of whom were French actresses that he had raised to the status of countess, had produced several natural children. By the time of Max Joseph&#x27;s death, he had legitimated seven of the males of his various alliances, and was considering the legitimation of two more. With this host of male offspring, although Charles Theodore certainly wished to acquire more territory, he needed it to be territory that he could bequeath through his testament, rather than territory encumbered by a legal entailment that could only pass to a legitimate child.

===Deal-maker===

Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, Archduke of Austria, and co-ruler with his mother, Empress Maria Theresa, coveted Bavaria. He felt the War of the Austrian Succession had shown that the House of Habsburg-Lorraine needed a wider sphere of influence in the German-speaking parts of the Holy Roman Empire. Without this, the family could not count on the election of their chosen male candidate as emperor, nor could the family count on an uncontested succession to the Habsburg territories of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. For most of Joseph&#x27;s adult life, he sought to strengthen his family&#x27;s influence in German-speaking lands. For him, this meant the acquisition of German lands (generally better-developed economically), not lands in the eastern region of the Habsburg empire, even such strategic territories as Bukovina.

Joseph married Max Joseph&#x27;s sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, hoping he could claim the Bavarian electorate for his offspring. After two years of unhappy marriage, Maria Josepha died without issue. When Max Joseph died ten years later, Joseph could only present a weak legal claim to Lower Bavaria through a dubious and ancient grant made by the Emperor Sigismund to the House of Habsburg in 1425. Knowing its poor legal grounds, Joseph negotiated a secret agreement with Charles Theodore shortly after Max Joseph&#x27;s death. In this agreement (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore ceded Lower Bavaria to Austria in exchange for uncontested succession to the remainder of the electorate. Charles Theodore also hoped to acquire from Joseph some unencumbered parts of the Austrian Netherlands and parts of Further Austria that he could bequeath to his bastards, but this was not written into the agreement and Joseph was not a particularly generous man. Furthermore, the agreement entirely ignored the interests of Charles Theodore&#x27;s own heir presumptive, Charles II August, of the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld. Charles August was the presumptive heir of Charles Theodore&#x27;s domains and titles. He had a clear and direct interest in the disposition of the Bavarian electorate, especially in its territorial integrity.

===Heir presumptive===

Unbeknownst to either Charles Theodore or Joseph, a widow (historians are uncertain &quot;which&quot; widow) opened secret negotiations with Prussia to secure the eventual succession of Charles II August (Charles August). Some historians maintain the active negotiator was Max Joseph&#x27;s widow, Maria Anna Sophia of Saxony. Others assert it was Max Joseph&#x27;s sister, Maria Antonia of Bavaria, who was also Charles August&#x27;s mother-in-law and the mother of the reigning Elector of Saxony. Ernest Henderson even maintained she was the &quot;only manly one among the many Wittelsbach parties&quot; involved in the issue.

Charles August was no great admirer of Joseph&#x27;s. As a younger man, he had sought the hand of Joseph&#x27;s sister, Archduchess Maria Amalia. She had been quite content to take him, but Joseph and their mother insisted she marry instead the better-connected Ferdinand, Duke of Parma. After this disappointment, Charles II August married Maria Amalia of Saxony in 1774; she was the daughter of Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony (d. 1763) and his wife Maria Antonia, Max Joseph&#x27;s sister. In 1769, the reigning Saxon elector, Frederick Augustus III, had married Charles August&#x27;s sister. Charles August, sometimes called &quot;duc de Deux-Ponts&quot; (a French translation of Zweibrücken, or two bridges), was a French client and could theoretically draw on French support for his claim. However, he had especially good relations with the Saxon Elector: both his mother- and brother-in-law wanted to ensure that Maria Amalia&#x27;s husband received his rightful inheritance.

==Diplomacy==

===Interested parties===
Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great&#x27;s prime minister, believed that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift the balance of power in the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia&#x27;s influence. Prussia&#x27;s recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted wars in Silesia and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia&#x27;s annexation of most of Silesia, and now, with the economy and society modernizing under his direction, Prussia was emerging as a great power. In the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years&#x27; War, Frederick had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom&#x27;s military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia&#x27;s status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.

Although equally interested in maintaining its influence among the German states, France had a double problem. As a supporter of the rebellious British colonies in North America, she wished to avoid a continental engagement; she could do more damage to the British in North America than in Europe. The Diplomatic Revolution in 1756 had gone against two hundred years of French foreign policy of opposition to the House of Habsburg, arguably bringing France massive territorial gains in repeated wars with Habsburg Austria and Spain. A reversal of this policy in 1756 tied French foreign policy in Europe to Vienna which, although it could give France additional influence and leverage, could also cripple the country&#x27;s diplomatic maneuvers with the other power players: Britain, Russia, and Prussia. Despite this restructuring, there existed in the French Court at Versailles, and in France generally, a strong anti-Austrian sentiment. The personal union (the diplomatic term for marriage) of Louis, then the Dauphin, and the Austrian Archduchess Marie Antoinette, was considered both a political and matrimonial &quot;mésalliance&quot; in the eyes of many Frenchmen. It flew in the face of 200 years of French foreign policy, in which the central axiom &quot;had been hostility to the House of Habsburg.&quot; The French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, maintained deep-seated hostility to the Austrians that antedated the alliance of 1756. He had not approved of the shift in France&#x27;s traditional bonds and considered the Austrians untrustworthy. Consequently, he managed to extricate France from immediate military obligations to Austria by 1778.

===Tensions rise===
On 3 January 1778, a few days after Max Joseph&#x27;s death, the electoral equerry proclaimed the succession of Charles Theodore. Dragoons rode through the streets of Munich, some banging drums and some blowing trumpets, and others shouting, &quot;Long Live our Elector Charles Theodore.&quot; According to 3 January agreement between Joseph and Charles Theodore, fifteen thousand Austrian troops occupied Mindelheim, ultimately more territory than had been granted to Joseph. Charles Theodore, who had dreamed of rebuilding the Burgundian empire, realized that Joseph was not seriously planning to exchange Bavaria, or even a portion of it, for the entirety of the Austrian Netherlands. At best, he might acquire a few portions of it, perhaps Hainaut or Guelders, Luxembourg, Limburg, or various dispersed possessions in Further Austria, most of which lay in southwestern Germany, but Joseph would never release any sizable portion of territory, and certainly not any territory of strategic military or commercial value.

While Charles Theodore&#x27;s dream of a Burgundian renaissance receded, Joseph continued on his course to annex part of Bavaria. The widow—Max Joseph&#x27;s widow or the mother-in-law or both—petitioned Prussia on behalf of Charles II August. Frederick&#x27;s envoys to the heir presumptive convinced this slighted prince to lodge protests with the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. Joseph&#x27;s troops remained in portions of Bavaria, even establishing an Austrian administration at Straubing, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. Austrian occupation of Bavaria was unacceptable to Charles August&#x27;s champion, Frederick. Prussian troops mobilized near Prussia&#x27;s border with Bohemia, reminiscent of the invasion in 1740 that so endangered Maria Theresa&#x27;s succession to the Habsburg hereditary lands. Meanwhile, the French wriggled out of their diplomatic obligations to Austria, telling Joseph that there would be no military support from Paris for a war against Prussia. Britain, Prussia&#x27;s strongest ally, was already mired in a war in North America, but Prussia&#x27;s military had recovered from the Seven Years&#x27; War and Frederick did not require any help. Prussia&#x27;s other ally, Saxony, aligned by two marriages with Charles August, was strategically prepared for war against Austria and ready to contribute twenty thousand troops. Watching from Saint Petersburg, Catherine II was willing to mop up the spoils of war for the Russian Empire but did not want to get involved in another costly European conflict.

For four months, negotiators shuttled between Vienna and Berlin, Dresden and Regensburg, and Zweibrücken, Munich and Mannheim. By early spring 1778, Austria and Prussia faced each other with armies several times the size of their forces during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and their confrontation had the potential to explode into another European-wide war.

==Action==
When it became clear that other monarchs would not acquiesce in a &quot;de facto&quot; partition of Bavaria, Joseph and his foreign minister, Anton von Kaunitz, scoured the Habsburg realm for troops and concentrated six hundred guns and a 180,000–190,000-man Austrian army in Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia. This amounted to most of Austria&#x27;s two-hundred thousand effectives, leaving much of the Habsburg border regions with the Ottoman Empire under-guarded. On 6 April 1778 Frederick of Prussia established his army of eighty thousand men on the Prussian border with Bohemia, near Neisse, Schweidnitz, and the County of Glatz, which Frederick had acquired from the Wittelsbach contender in 1741 in exchange for his electoral support of Charles VII. At Glatz, Frederick completed his preparations for invasion: he gathered supplies, arranged a line-of-march, brought up his artillery and drilled his soldiers. His younger brother, Prince Henry, formed a second army of seventy-five to a hundred thousand men to the north and west, in Saxony. In April, Frederick and Joseph officially joined their armies in the field, and diplomatic negotiations ended.

In early July 1778, the Prussian general Johann Jakob von Wunsch (1717–1788) crossed into Bohemia near the fortified town of Náchod with several hundred men. The local garrison, commanded by Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, then a &quot;Rittmeister&quot; (captain of cavalry), included only fifty hussars. Despite the poor numerical odds, Nauendorf sallied out to engage Wunsch&#x27;s men. When his small force reached Wunsch&#x27;s, he greeted the Prussians as friends; by the time the Prussians were close enough to realize the allegiance of the hussars, Nauendorf and his small band had acquired the upper hand. Wunsch withdrew; the next day, Nauendorf was promoted to major. In a letter to her son, the Empress Maria Theresa wrote: &quot;They say you were so pleased with Nauendorf, a rookie from Carlstadt or Hungary, who killed seven men, that you gave him twelve ducats.&quot;

===Invasion===
A few days after Wunsch&#x27;s encounter with Nauendorf, Frederick entered Bohemia. His eighty thousand troops occupied Náchod but advanced no further. The Habsburg army stood on the heights of the Elbe river, nominally under Joseph but with Count Franz Moritz von Lacy in practical command. Lacy had served under Marshal Daun during the Seven Years&#x27; War and knew his military business. He established the Austrian army on the most defensible position available: centered at Jaroměř, a triple line of redoubts extended southwest along the river to Königgrätz. The Austrians also augmented this defensive line with their six hundred artillery pieces.
While the main Habsburg army faced Frederick at the Elbe, a smaller army under the command of Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon guarded the passes from Saxony and Lusatia into Bohemia. Laudon was another battle-hardened and cagey commander with extensive field experience, but even he could not cover the long frontier completely. Shortly after Frederick crossed into Bohemia, Prince Henry, a brilliant strategist in his own right, maneuvered around Laudon&#x27;s troops and entered Bohemia at Hainspach. To avoid being flanked, Laudon withdrew across the Iser river, but by mid-August, the main Austrian army was in danger of being outflanked by Henry on its left wing. At its center and right, it faced a well-disciplined army commanded by Frederick, arguably the best tactical general of the age and feared for his victories against France and Austria in the previous war.

While his main army remained entrenched on the heights above the Elbe, Joseph encouraged raids against the Prussian troops. On 7 August 1778, with two squadrons of his regiment, the intrepid &quot;rookie&quot;, now Major Nauendorf, led a raid against a Prussian convoy at Bieberdorf in the County of Glatz. The surprised convoy surrendered and Nauendorf captured its officers, 110 men, 476 horses, 240 wagons of flour, and thirteen transport wagons. This kind of action characterized the entire war. There were no major battles; the war consisted of a series of raids and counter-raids during which the opposing sides lived off the countryside and tried to deny each other access to supplies and fodder. Soldiers later said they spent more time foraging for food than they did fighting.

The armies remained in their encampments for the campaign season while men and horses ate all the provisions and forage for miles around. Prince Henry wrote to his brother, suggesting they complete their operations by 22 August, at which time he estimated he would have exhausted local supplies of food for his men and fodder for his horses. Frederick agreed. He laid plans to cross the Elbe and approach the Austrian force from the rear, but the more he examined the conditions of Joseph&#x27;s entrenchments, the more he realized that the campaign was already lost. Even if he and Henry executed simultaneous attacks on the Königgrätz heights, such a plan exposed Henry to a flanking attack from Laudon. A coordinated frontal and rear assault was also unlikely to succeed. Even if it did, the Prussian losses would be unacceptable and would demolish his army&#x27;s capacity to resist other invaders. From Frederick&#x27;s perspective, the Russians and the Swedes were always ready to take advantage of any perceived Prussian weakness, and the French also could not be trusted to keep their distance. For Frederick, it was a risk not worth taking. Despite this realization, the four armies—two Austrian, two Prussian—remained in place until September, eating as much of the country&#x27;s resources as they could.

From their advantageous height by Königgrätz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On the same day that Frederick&#x27;s doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the British historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitring, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged his finger at the man, as if to say, &quot;Do not do that.&quot; The Croat thought better of shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.

Nauendorf continued his raids, the soldiers foraged for food and dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick glared at one another by Königgrätz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to the Empress Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother&#x27;s maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to abdicate. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, she was willing to send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, even though she disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick to keep an eye on each other&#x27;s troops while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.

===Winter actions===
Appointed as the commander of the Austrian winter cordon, Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser ordered a small assault-column under the command of Colonel Wilhelm Klebeck to attack the village of Dittersbach. Klebeck led a column of Croats into the village. During the action, four hundred Prussians were killed, another four hundred made prisoner, and eight colors were captured. Following his successes against the Prussians in 1778, Joseph awarded Wurmser the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 21 October 1778.

In another raid, on 1 January 1779, Colonel Franz Levenehr led 3,200 men (four battalions, six squadrons, and 16 artillery) into Zuckmantel, a village in Silesia on the Prussian border, south of Ziegenhals. There he ran against a 10,000-man Prussian force commanded by General Johann Jakob von Wunsch; the Austrians decisively defeated the Prussians, with a loss of 20 men (wounded) against the Prussian losses of 800. Two weeks later, Wurmser advanced into the County of Glatz in five columns, two of which, commanded by Major General Franz Joseph, Count Kinsky, surrounded Habelschwerdt on 17–18 January. While one column secured the approach, the other, under the leadership of Colonel Pallavicini, stormed the village and captured the Landgrave of Hessen-Philippsthal, 37 officers, plus 700 to 1,000 men, three cannon and seven colors; in this action, the Prussians lost 400 men dead or wounded. Wurmser himself led the third column in an assault on the so-called Swedish blockhouse at Oberschwedeldorf. It and the village of Habelschwerdt were set on fire by howitzers. Major General Terzy (1730–1800), who was covering with the remaining two columns, threw back the enemy support and took three hundred Prussian prisoners. Meanwhile, Wurmser maintained his position at the nearby villages of Rückerts and Reinerz. His forward patrols reached the outskirts of Glatz and patrolled much of the Silesian border with Prussia near Schweidnitz. Halberschwerdt and Oberschedeldorf were both destroyed.

On 3 March 1779, Nauendorf again raided Berbersdorf with a large force of infantry and hussars and captured the entire Prussian garrison. Joseph awarded him the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa (19 May 1779).

==Impact==

In the Treaty of Teschen (May 1779), Maria Theresa returned Lower Bavaria to Charles Theodore, but kept the so-called Innviertel, a strip of land in the drainage basin of the Inn river. She and Joseph were surprised to find that the small territory had 120,000 inhabitants. Saxony received a financial reward of six million gulden from the principal combatants for its role in the intervention.

The War of the Bavarian Succession was the last war for both Frederick and Maria Theresa, whose reigns began and ended with wars against one another. Although they deployed armies three to four times the size of the armies of the Seven Years&#x27; War, neither monarch used the entirety of the military force each had at their disposal, making this war-without-battles remarkable. Despite the restraint of the monarchs, some early nineteenth-century casualty estimates suggest that tens of thousands died of starvation and hunger-related disease. Carlyle&#x27;s more moderate estimate lies at about ten thousand Prussian and probably another ten thousand Austrian dead. Michael Hochedlinger assesses combined casualties at approximately thirty thousand; Robert Kann gives no estimate of casualties but suggests the primary causes of death were cholera and dysentery. Gaston Bodart, whose 1915 work is still considered the authority on Austrian military losses, is specific: five Austrian generals (he does not name them), over twelve thousand soldiers, and 74 officers died of disease. In minor actions and skirmishes, nine officers and 265 men were killed and four officers and 123 men were wounded, but not fatally. Sixty-two officers and 2,802 men were taken prisoner, and 137 men were missing. Over three thousand Imperial soldiers deserted. Finally, twenty-six officers and 372 men were discharged with disabilities. Bodart also gives Prussian losses: one general killed (he does not say which), 87 officers and 3,364 men killed, wounded or captured. Overall, he assumes losses of ten percent of the fighting force. Little has been discovered of civilian casualties, although certainly the civilians also suffered from starvation and disease. There were other damages: for example, Habelschwerdt and one of its hamlets were destroyed by fire.

Despite its short duration, the war itself cost Prussia 33 million florins. For the Austrians, the cost was higher: 65 million florins, for a state with an annual revenue of 50 million florins. Joseph himself described war as &quot;a horrible thing ... the ruin of many innocent people.&quot;

===Change in warfare===
This was the last European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a distance while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve the monarchs&#x27; differences. Given the length of time—six months—the cost in life and treasure was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less than a generation later in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, though, this six-month engagement seems mild. Yet while historians often dismissed it as the last of the archaic mode of &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the sheer sizes of the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities and willingness to conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in previous generations.

The war also reflected a new height in military spending, especially by the Habsburgs. After the Seven Years&#x27; War, the size of the Habsburg military shrank, from 201,311 men in arms in 1761 to 163,613 in 1775. In preparing for a second summer&#x27;s campaign, Joseph&#x27;s army grew from 195,108 effectives in the summer of 1778 to 308,555 men in arms in Spring 1779. Habsburg military strength never dropped below two hundred thousand effectives between 1779 and 1792, when Austria entered the War of the First Coalition. Several times it surged above three hundred thousand men in arms, responding to needs on the Ottoman border or the revolt in the Austrian Netherlands. The military also underwent a massive organizational overhaul.

In the vernacular, the Austrians called the war &quot;Zwetschgenrummel&quot; (&quot;Plum Fuss&quot;), and for the Prussians and Saxons, it was &quot;Kartoffelkrieg&quot; (&quot;Potato War&quot;). In the historiography of European warfare, historians almost always describe the War of the Bavarian Succession &quot;in dismissive or derisive terms [as] the apotheosis (or perhaps caricature) of old regime warfare,&quot; despite its grand name. Some historians have maintained that the focus on the consumption of the produce of the land gave the war its popular name. Others suggest that the two armies lobbed potatoes instead of cannonballs or mortars. A third theory maintains that the war acquired its popular name because it took place during the potato harvest.

===Resurgence of the problem===

The underlying problem was not solved: Joseph&#x27;s foreign policy dictated the expansion of Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories, and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia&#x27;s growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again sought to make a territorial deal with Charles Theodore, again offering to trade portions of Bavarian territory for portions of the Austrian Netherlands. This time it would be a straight trade: territory for territory, not a partition. Although the Austrian Netherlands was a wealthy territory, it was a thorn in Joseph&#x27;s side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources he desperately needed elsewhere in his realm. Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the Netherlands entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the financial benefits of both his Netherlands possessions and the Bavarian territories.

Even if Joseph had to give up the Austrian Netherlands, it meant &quot;the barter of an indefensible strategic position and ... an economic liability for a great territorial and political gain, adjacent to the monarchy.&quot; Again, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, resented the possible loss of his Bavarian expectancy, and again, Frederick of Prussia offered aid. This time, no war developed, not even a &quot;Potato War&quot;. Instead, Frederick founded the &quot;Fürstenbund,&quot; or the Union of Princes, comprising the influential princes of the northern German states, and these individuals jointly pressured Joseph to relinquish his ambitious plans. Rather than increasing Austria&#x27;s influence in German affairs, Joseph&#x27;s actions increased Prussian influence, making Prussia seem like a protector state against greedy Habsburg imperialism (an ironic contrast to the earlier stage of the Austro-Prussian rivalry, in which Frederick seized German-speaking lands with military force and without formal declaration of war, causing most of the German states to join Austria). In 1799, Bavaria and the Palatinate passed to Maximilian IV Joseph, brother of Charles August, whose only child had died in 1784.

==Long-term effect: the intensification of German dualism==

Joseph understood the problems facing his multi-ethnic patrimony and the ambivalent position the Austrians held in the Holy Roman Empire. Although the Habsburgs and their successor house of Habsburg-Lorraine had, with two exceptions, held the position of Emperor since the early 15th century, the basis of 18th-century Habsburg power lay not in the Holy Roman Empire itself, but in Habsburg territories in Eastern Europe, where the family had vast domains. For Joseph or his successors to wield influence in the German-speaking states, they needed to acquire additional German-speaking territories. Acquisition of Central European territories with German-speaking subjects would strengthen the Austrian position in the Holy Roman Empire. As far as Joseph was concerned, only this could shift the center of the Habsburg empire into German-speaking Central Europe. This agenda made dispensable both the Austrian Netherlands—Habsburg territories which lay furthest west—and Galicia, furthest east. It also made the recovery of German-speaking Silesia and acquisition of new territories in Bavaria essential.

By the late 1770s, Joseph also faced important diplomatic obstacles in consolidating Habsburg influence in Central Europe. When the British had been Austria&#x27;s allies, Austria could count on British support in its wars, but Britain was now allied with Prussia. In the Diplomatic Revolution, the French replaced the British as Austria&#x27;s ally, but they were fickle, as Joseph discovered when Vergennes extricated Versailles from its obligations. Russia, which also had been an important Austrian ally for most of the Seven Years&#x27; War, sought opportunities for expansion at the expense of its weak neighbors. In 1778, that meant Poland and the Ottomans, but Joseph fully understood the danger of appearing weak in Russia&#x27;s eyes: Habsburg lands could be carved off easily by Catherine&#x27;s diplomatic knife. Still, Frederick of Prussia was the most definite enemy, as he had been throughout the reigns of Theresa and Franz before him, when the Prussian state&#x27;s emergence as a player on the European stage had occurred at Habsburg expense, first with the loss of Silesia, and later in the 1750s and 1760s. Joseph sought to unify the different portions of his realm, not the German states as a whole, and to establish Habsburg hegemony in German-speaking central Europe beginning with the partition of Bavaria.

The broad geographic outlines of European states changed rapidly in the last fifty years of the century, with partitions of Poland and territorial exchanges through conquest and diplomacy. Rulers sought to centralize their control over their domains and create well-defined borders within which their writ was law. For Joseph, the acquisition of Bavaria, or at least parts of it, would link Habsburg territories in Bohemia with those in the Tyrol and partially compensate Austria for its loss of Silesia. The Bavarian succession crisis provided Joseph with a viable opportunity to consolidate his influence in the Central European states, to bolster his financially strapped government with much-needed revenue, and to strengthen his army with German-speaking conscripts. Supremacy in the German states was worth a war, but for Frederick, the preservation of Charles August&#x27;s inheritance was not. He had had sufficient war in the first years of his reign, and in its last twenty years, he sought to preserve the status quo, not to enter into risky adventures that might upset it. If he had to withdraw from engagement with Joseph&#x27;s army, such a sacrifice was a temporary measure. Warfare was only one means of diplomacy, and he could employ others in this contest with Austria. The Austro-Prussian dualism that dominated the next century&#x27;s unification movement rumbled ominously in the War of the Bavarian Succession.

<text>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (PPFA), or simply Planned Parenthood, is an American nonprofit organization that provides reproductive and sexual healthcare and sexual education in the United States and globally. It is a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF).

PPFA has its roots in Brooklyn, New York, where Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, in 1916. Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921, and 14 years after her exit as its president, ABCL&#x27;s successor organization became Planned Parenthood in 1942.

Planned Parenthood consists of 159 medical and non-medical affiliates, which operate over 600 health clinics in the United States. It partners with organizations in 12 countries globally. The organization directly provides a variety of reproductive health services and sexual education, contributes to research in reproductive technology and advocates for the protection and expansion of reproductive rights. Research shows that closures of Planned Parenthood clinics lead to increases in maternal mortality rates.

PPFA is the largest single provider of reproductive health services and the largest single provider of abortions in the United States. In its 2023 Annual Report, PPFA reported seeing over two million patients and performing a total of 9.13 million discrete services including 392,715 abortions. Its combined annual revenue is billion, including approximately million in government funding such as Medicaid reimbursements. Throughout its history, PPFA and its member clinics have been the subject of support, criticism, controversy, protests, and violent attacks.
== History ==
=== Origins ===

The origins of Planned Parenthood date to October 16, 1916, when Margaret Sanger, her sister Ethel Byrne, and Fania Mindell opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. in the Brownsville section of the New York borough of Brooklyn. They distributed birth control, birth control advice, and birth control information. All three women were arrested and jailed for violating provisions of the Comstock Act, accused of distributing obscene materials at the clinic. The so-called Brownsville trials brought national attention and support to their cause. Sanger and her co-defendants were convicted on misdemeanor charges, which they appealed through two subsequent appeals courts. While the convictions were not overturned, the judge who issued the final ruling also modified the law to permit physician-prescribed birth control. The women&#x27;s campaign led to major changes in the laws governing birth control and sex education in the United States.

In 1921, the clinic was organized into the American Birth Control League, the core of the only national birth-control organization in the U.S. until the 1960s. By 1941, it was operating 222 centers and had served 49,000 clients. In 1923, Sanger opened the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB) for dispensing contraceptives under the supervision of licensed physicians and studying their effectiveness.

Some found the ABCL&#x27;s title offensive and &quot;against families&quot;, so the League began discussions for a new name. In 1938, a group of private citizens organized the Citizens Committee for Planned Parenthood to aid the American Birth Control League in spreading scientific knowledge about birth control to the general public. The BCCRB merged with the ABCL in 1939 to form the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA). In 1942 the name of the BCFA was changed to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

=== 1940s–1960s ===

Under the leadership of National Director D. Kenneth Rose, the PPFA expanded its programs and services through the 1940s, adding affiliate organizations throughout the country. By the end of World War II, the Federation was no longer solely a center for birth control services or a clearing house for contraceptive information but had emerged as a major national health organization. PPFA&#x27;s programs included a full range of family planning services including marriage education and counseling, and infertility services. The leadership of the PPFA, largely consisting of businessmen and male physicians, endeavored to incorporate its contraceptive services unofficially into regional and national public health programs by emphasizing less politicized aspects such as child spacing.

During the 1950s, the Federation further adjusted its programs and message to appeal to a family-centered, more conservative post-war populace, while continuing to function, through its affiliated clinics, as the more reliable source of contraceptives in the country.

From 1942 to 1962, PPFA concentrated its efforts on strengthening its ties to affiliates, expanding public education programs, and improving its medical and research work. By 1960, visitors to PPFA centers across the nation numbered over 300,000 per year.

Largely relying on a volunteer workforce, by 1960 the Federation had provided family planning counseling in hundreds of communities across the country. Planned Parenthood was one of the founding members of the International Planned Parenthood Federation when it was launched at a conference in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, in 1952.

In 1961, the population crisis debate, along with funding shortages, convinced PPFA to merge with the World Population Emergency Campaign, a citizens&#x27; fund-raising organization to become PPFA-World Population.

Both Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger are strongly associated with the abortion issue today. For much of the organization&#x27;s history, however, and throughout Sanger&#x27;s life, abortion was illegal in the U.S., and discussions of the issue were often censored. During this period, Sanger – like other American advocates of birth control – publicly condemned abortion, arguing that it would not be needed if every woman had access to birth control.

=== 1960s–present ===

Following Margaret Sanger, Alan Frank Guttmacher became president of Planned Parenthood, serving from 1962 until 1974. During his tenure, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the sale of the original birth control pill, giving rise to new attitudes towards women&#x27;s reproductive freedom. Also during his presidency, Planned Parenthood lobbied the federal government to support reproductive health, culminating with President Richard Nixon&#x27;s signing of Title X to provide government subsidies for low-income women to access family planning services. The Center for Family Planning Program Development was also founded as a semi-autonomous division during this time. The center became an independent organization and was renamed the Guttmacher Institute in 1977.

Planned Parenthood began to advocate abortion law reform beginning in 1955, when the organization&#x27;s medical director, Mary Calderone, convened a national conference of medical professionals on the issue. The conference was the first instance of physicians and other professionals advocating reform of the laws which criminalized abortion, and it played a key role in creating a movement for the reform of abortion laws in the U.S. Focusing, at first, on legalizing therapeutic abortion, Planned Parenthood became an increasingly vocal proponent of liberalized abortion laws during the 1960s, culminating in its call for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws in 1969. In the years that followed, the organization played a key role in landmark abortion rights cases such as &quot;Roe v Wade&quot; (1973) and &quot;Planned Parenthood v Casey&quot; (1992). Once abortion was legalized during the early 1970s, Planned Parenthood also began acting as an abortion provider.

Faye Wattleton became the first African American president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1978. Wattleton, who was also the youngest president in Planned Parenthood&#x27;s history, served in this role until 1992. During her term, Planned Parenthood grew to become the seventh largest charity in the country, providing services to four million clients each year through its 170 affiliates, whose activities were spread across 50 states.

From 1996 to 2006, Planned Parenthood was led by Gloria Feldt. Feldt activated the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF), the organization&#x27;s political action committee, launching what was the most far-reaching electoral advocacy effort in its history. The PPAF serves as the nonpartisan political advocacy arm of PPFA. It engages in educational and electoral activity, including legislative advocacy, voter education, and grassroots organizing to promote the PPFA mission. Feldt also launched the Responsible Choices Action Agenda, a nationwide campaign to increase services to prevent unwanted pregnancies, improve the quality of reproductive care, and ensure access to safe and legal abortions. Another initiative was the commencement of a &quot;Global Partnership Program&quot;, to build a vibrant activist constituency in support of family planning.

On February 15, 2006, Cecile Richards, the daughter of former Texas governor Ann Richards, and formerly the deputy chief of staff to the U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (the Democratic Leader in the United States House of Representatives), became president of the organization. In 2012, Richards was voted one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot;.

Richards&#x27; tenure as president of the organization ended on April 30, 2018. Current Planned Parenthood board member Joe Solmonese was appointed as transition chair to temporarily oversee the day-to-day operations of Planned Parenthood after Richards&#x27; departure.

On September 12, 2018, the organization announced that Leana Wen would take over as president, effective November 2018. Wen was removed as president of Planned Parenthood by the organization&#x27;s board of directors on July 16, 2019. Alexis McGill Johnson, a board member and former chairwoman, became the organization&#x27;s acting president.

==== Data breaches ====

In October 2021, a hacker gained access to the data network of the Los Angeles branch of Planned Parenthood and obtained the personal information of approximately 400,000 patients. On December 1, 2021, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the breach was a ransomware attack. The organization did not say if they paid the ransom or if the perpetrators made any demands. There was no indication as to who was responsible for the hack. The Metropolitan Washington branch of Planned Parenthood was also hacked in 2020 with donor and patient information compromised, including dates of birth, social security numbers, financial information, and medical data.

=== Margaret Sanger Awards ===
In 1966, PPFA began awarding the Margaret Sanger Award annually to honor, in their words, &quot;individuals of distinction in recognition of excellence and leadership in furthering reproductive health and reproductive rights.&quot; In the first year, it was awarded to four men: Carl G. Hartman, William Henry Draper Jr., Lyndon B. Johnson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Later recipients have included John D. Rockefeller III, Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Hillary Clinton, and Ted Turner.

== Services ==

The services provided by PPFA affiliates vary by location, with just over half of all Planned Parenthood affiliates in the U.S. performing abortions. Services provided by PPFA include birth control and long-acting reversible contraception; emergency contraception; clinical breast examinations; cervical cancer screening; pregnancy testing and pregnancy options counseling; prenatal care; testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections; sex education; vasectomies; LGBT services; and abortion. Contrary to the assumption of some, Planned Parenthood conducts cancer screenings but does not provide mammograms, although Planned Parenthood physicians do refer their patients to other outside clinics where they can get mammograms.

In 2013, PPFA reported seeing 2.7million patients in 4.6million clinical visits. Roughly 16 percent of its clients are teenagers. According to PPFA, in 2014 the organization provided 3.6million contraceptive services, 4.5million sexually transmitted infection services, about onemillion cancer related services, over onemillion pregnancy tests and prenatal services, over 324,000 abortion services, and over 100,000 other services, for a total of 9.5million discrete services. PPFA is well known for providing services to minorities and to poor people; according to PPFA, approximately four out of five of their clients have incomes at or below 150percent of the federal poverty level. Services for men&#x27;s health include STI testing and treatment, vasectomy procedures, and erectile dysfunction services. Education is available regarding male birth control and lowering the risk of sexually transmitted infections.

Planned Parenthood won the 2020 Webby Award for Machine Learning and Bots for their Sex Education chatbot.

== Facilities ==

PPFA has two national offices in the United States: one in Washington, D.C., and one in New York City. It has three international offices, including a hub office in London, England. It has 68 medical and related affiliates and 101 other affiliates including 34 political action committees. These affiliates together operate more than 700 health centers in all 50 states in the U.S. plus the District of Columbia. PPFA owns about million in property, including real estate. In addition, PPFA spends a little over million per year for rented space. The largest facility, a million, structure, was completed in Houston, Texas, in May 2010.

== Funding ==

Planned Parenthood has received federal funding since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed into law the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act, amending the Public Health Service Act. Title X of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information. The law had support from both Republicans and Democrats. Nixon described Title X funding as based on the premise that &quot;no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition.&quot;

Donors to Planned Parenthood have included the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Buffett Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Turner Foundation, the Cullmans, and others. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&#x27;s contributions to the organization have been specifically marked to avoid funding abortions. Some donors, such as the Buffett Foundation, have supported reproductive health that can include abortion services. Anti-abortion groups have advocated the boycott of donors to Planned Parenthood. Corporate donors include CREDO Mobile.

In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, total revenue was billion: non-government health services revenue was million, government revenue (such as Medicaid reimbursements) was million, private contributions totaled million, and million came from other operating revenue. According to Planned Parenthood, 59 percent of the group&#x27;s revenue is put towards the provision of health services, while non-medical services such as sex education and public policy work make up another 15 percent; management expenses, fundraising, and international family planning programs account for about 16 percent, and 10 percent of the revenue in 2013–2014 was not spent.

Planned Parenthood receives over a third of its money in government grants and contracts (about million in 2014). By law (Hyde Amendment), federal funding cannot be allocated for abortions (except in rare cases), but some opponents of abortion have argued that allocating money to Planned Parenthood for the provision of other medical services allows other funds to be reallocated for abortions.

A coalition of national and local anti-abortion groups have lobbied federal and state governments to stop funding Planned Parenthood. As a result, federal and state legislators have proposed legislation to reduce funding levels. Eight statesAlabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Utahhave enacted such proposals. In some cases, the courts have overturned such actions, citing conflict with federal or state laws; in others the federal executive branch has provided funding in lieu of the states. In some states, Planned Parenthood was completely or partially defunded.

In August 2015, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal attempted to end Louisiana&#x27;s contract with Planned Parenthood to treat Medicaid patients at a time when there was an epidemic of sexually transmitted infections in Louisiana. Planned Parenthood and three patients sued the state of Louisiana, with the United States Department of Justice siding with Planned Parenthood.

On February 2, 2016, the U.S. House failed to override President Obama&#x27;s veto of (Restoring Americans&#x27; Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015) which would have prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal Medicaid funds for one year.

Late in 2016, the Obama administration issued a rule effective in January 2017 banning U.S. states from withholding federal family-planning funds from health clinics that give abortions, including Planned Parenthood affiliates; this rule mandates that local and state governments give federal funds for services related to sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy care, fertility, contraception, and breast and cervical cancer screening to qualified health providers whether or not they give abortions. However, this rule was blocked by a federal judge the day before it would have taken effect. In 2017, it was overturned by new legislation.

The proposed American Health Care Act (), announced by Congressional Republicans in March 2017, would have made Planned Parenthood &quot;ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants.&quot;

On August 19, 2019, Planned Parenthood voluntarily withdrew from Title X funding due to a regulatory gag order stating that medical institutions that receive Title X funding cannot refer patients for abortions.

== Political advocacy ==

Planned Parenthood is an advocate for the legal and political protection of reproductive rights. This advocacy includes helping to sponsor abortion rights and women&#x27;s rights events. The Federation opposes restrictions on women&#x27;s reproductive health services, including parental consent laws for minors. To justify this position, Planned Parenthood has cited the case of Becky Bell, who died following an illegal abortion rather than seek parental consent for a legal one. Planned Parenthood also takes the position that laws requiring parental notification before an abortion can be performed on a minor are unconstitutional on privacy grounds.

The organization opposes laws requiring ultrasounds before abortions, stating that their only purpose is to make abortions more difficult to obtain. Planned Parenthood has also opposed initiatives that require waiting periods before abortions, and bans on late-term abortions including intact dilation and extraction, which has been illegal in the U.S. since 2003. Planned Parenthood supports the wide availability of emergency contraception such as the PlanB pill. It opposes conscience clauses, which allow pharmacists to refuse to dispense drugs against their beliefs. Planned Parenthood has been critical of hospitals that do not provide access to emergency contraception for rape victims. Citing the need for medically accurate information in sex education, Planned Parenthood opposes abstinence-only education in public schools. Instead, Planned Parenthood is a provider of, and endorses, comprehensive sex education, which includes a discussion of both abstinence and birth control.

Planned Parenthood&#x27;s advocacy activities are executed by the &quot;Planned Parenthood Action Fund&quot;, which is registered as a 501(c)(4) charity, and files financial information jointly with PPFA. The committee was founded in 1996, by then-president Gloria Feldt, to maintain supportive health rights and supporting political candidates of the same mindset. In the 2012 election cycle, the committee gained prominence based on its effectiveness in spending on candidates. Although the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF) shares some leadership with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the president of PPAF, Cecile Richards, testified before Congress in September 2015 that she did not manage the organization. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund has 58 active, separately incorporated chapters in 41 states and maintains national headquarters in New York and Washington, D.C. Planned Parenthood has received grants from the Obama administration to help promote the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.

=== Political spending ===

Planned Parenthood spends money on politics and elections through the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (its federal political action committee), through its Super PAC, and through a variety of related 501(c)(4) entities. Planned Parenthood endorsed Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In the 2014 election cycle, Planned Parenthood spent on contributions to candidates and political parties (overwhelmingly to Democrats) and on independent expenditures.

== Before the U.S. Supreme Court ==

Planned Parenthood regional chapters have been active in the American courts. Several cases in which Planned Parenthood has been a party have reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Notable among these cases is the 1992 case &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, the case that sets forth the current constitutional abortion standard. In this case, &quot;Planned Parenthood&quot; was the Southeast Pennsylvania Chapter, and &quot;Casey&quot; was Robert Casey, the governor of Pennsylvania. The ultimate ruling was split, and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was narrowed but upheld in an opinion written by Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter. Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens concurred with the main decision in separately written opinions. The Supreme Court struck down spousal consent requirements for married women to obtain abortions, but found no &quot;undue burden&quot;—an alternative to strict scrutiny, which tests the allowable limitations on rights protected under the Constitution—from the other statutory requirements. Dissenting were William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Byron White. Blackmun, Rehnquist, and White were the only justices who voted on the original &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision in 1973 who were still on the Supreme Court to rule on this case, and their votes on this case were consistent with their votes on the original decision that legalized abortion. Only Blackmun voted to maintain &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in its entirety.

&quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, along with &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, was eventually overturned by &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; in 2022.

Other related cases include:

* &quot;Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth&quot; (1976). Planned Parenthood challenged the constitutionality of a Missouri law encompassing parental consent, spousal consent, clinic bookkeeping, and allowed abortion methods. Portions of the challenged law were held to be constitutional, others not. The decision was superseded by &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022).
* &quot;Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City v. Ashcroft&quot; (1983). Planned Parenthood challenged the constitutionality of a Missouri law encompassing parental consent, clinic record keeping, and hospitalization requirements. Most of the challenged law was held to be constitutional. The decision was superseded by &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022).
* &quot;Planned Parenthood of Columbia/Willamette v. American Coalition of Life Activists&quot; (2002). The American Coalition of Life Activists (ACLA) released a flier and &quot;Wanted&quot; posters with complete personal information about doctors who performed abortions. A civil jury and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals both found that the materials were &quot;true threats&quot; and not protected speech. ACLA appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was rejected.
* &quot;Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood&quot; (2003). Planned Parenthood sued U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for an injunction against the enforcement of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. Planned Parenthood argued the act was unconstitutional because it violated the Fifth Amendment, namely in that it was overly vague, violated women&#x27;s constitutional right to have access to abortion, and did not include language for exceptions for the health of the mother. Both the district court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, but that decision was overturned in a 54 ruling by the Supreme Court.
* &quot;Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England&quot; (2006). Planned Parenthood &quot;et al.&quot; challenged the constitutionality of a New Hampshire parental notification law related to access to abortion. In Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s final decision before retirement, the Supreme Court sent the case back to lower courts with instructions to seek a remedy short of wholesale invalidation of the statute. New Hampshire ended up repealing the statute via the legislative process. The decision was superseded by &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022).

== Other court cases ==
Some state attorneys general have subpoenaed medical records of patients treated by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood has gone to court to keep from turning over these records, citing medical privacy and concerns about the motivation for seeking the records.

In 2006, Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline, a Republican, released some sealed patient records obtained from Planned Parenthood to the public. His actions were described as &quot;troubling&quot; by the state Supreme Court, but Planned Parenthood was compelled to turn over the medical records, albeit with more stringent court-mandated privacy safeguards for the patients involved. In 2007 Kline&#x27;s successor, Paul J. Morrison, a Democrat, notified the clinic that no criminal charges would be filed after a three-year investigation, as &quot;an objective, unbiased and thorough examination&quot; showed no wrongdoing. Morrison stated that he believed Kline had politicized the Attorney General&#x27;s office. In 2012, a Kansas district attorney found that the practices of the Kansas City-area Planned Parenthood clinic was &quot;within accepted practices in the medical community&quot; and dropped all of the remaining criminal charges. In all, the Planned Parenthood clinic had faced 107 criminal charges from Kline and other Kansas prosecutors, all of which were ultimately dismissed.

In 2006, the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled that Planned Parenthood was not required to turn over its medical records in an investigation of possible child abuse. In 2005, Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota was fined for violating a Minnesota state parental consent law.

In 2012, a Texas state court judge, Gary Harger, denied Planned Parenthood&#x27;s request for a temporary restraining order against the State of Texas, concluding that the State may exclude otherwise qualified doctors and clinics from receiving state funding if the doctors or clinics advocate for abortion rights.

In 2022, Nicole Moore, a Black woman who was the director of Planned Parenthood&#x27;s multicultural brand engagement from January 2020 to November 2021, filed a lawsuit alleging that she faced months of racial discrimination while working at Planned Parenthood.

== Impact ==

A 2016 study found that the exclusion of Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics from Texas&#x27;s Medicaid fee-for-service family-planning program was linked to reductions in the provision of contraception and an increase in child-bearing for women who used injectable contraceptives and who were covered by Medicaid.

A 2020 study found that closure of Planned Parenthood clinics resulted in increases in the maternal mortality rate: &quot;Planned Parenthood clinic closures negatively impacted all women, increasing mortality by 6–15% across racial/ethnic groups.&quot;

== Debate and opposition ==
=== Margaret Sanger and eugenics ===
In the 1920s, various theories of eugenics were popular among intellectuals in the U.S. In her campaign to promote birth control, Sanger teamed with eugenics organizations such as the American Eugenics Society, although she argued against many of their positions. Scholars describe Sanger as believing that birth control and sterilization should be voluntary, and not based on race. Sanger advocated for &quot;voluntary motherhood&quot;—the right to choose when to be pregnant—for all women, as an important element of women&#x27;s rights. As part of her efforts to promote birth control, however, Sanger found common cause with proponents of eugenics, believing that she and they both sought to &quot;assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit&quot;.

Critics of Planned Parenthood often refer to Sanger&#x27;s connection with supporters of eugenics to discredit the organization by associating it, and birth control, with the more negative modern view of eugenics. Reacting to criticisms of Sanger&#x27;s endorsement of eugenics, in 2020 Planned Parenthood took steps to distance itself from their founder by remoiving some mentions of Sanger from their website and renaming the Planned Parenthood building on Bleecker Street (which previously was named after Sanger). Essayist Katha Pollitt and Sanger biographer Ellen Chesner criticized Planned Parenthood for succumbing to pressure from the anti-abortion movement.

=== Abortion ===

Planned Parenthood has occupied a central position in the abortion debate in the U.S. and has been among the most prominent targets of the U.S. anti-abortion movement for decades. Some members of Congress, overwhelmingly Republican, have attempted since the 1980s to end federal funding of the organization, nearly leading to a government shutdown over the issue in 2011. Planned Parenthood has consistently maintained that federal money received by Planned Parenthood is not used to fund abortion services, but anti-abortion activists have argued that the federal funding frees up other resources that are, in turn, used to provide abortions.

Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortions in the U.S., but pro-choice advocates have argued that the organization&#x27;s family planning services reduce the need for abortions; in the words of Megan Crepeau of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Planned Parenthood could be &quot;characterized as America&#x27;s largest abortion preventer&quot;. Anti-abortion activists dispute the evidence that greater access to contraceptives reduces abortion frequency.
==== Undercover videos by anti-abortion activists ====
Periodically, anti-abortion advocates have tried to demonstrate that Planned Parenthood does not follow applicable state or federal laws. The groups called or visited Planned Parenthood health centers posing as victims of statutory rape, minors who by law need parental notification before an abortion, racist donors seeking to earmark donations to reduce the African American population, or pimps seeking abortions for underage prostitutes. As a result of some of these videos, several Planned Parenthood workers have been disciplined or fired. An article in &quot;Salon&quot; stated that a 2005 inspection by the Bush administration&#x27;s Department of Health and Human Services &quot;yielded no evidence of clinics around the nation failing to comply with laws on reporting child abuse, child molestation, sexual abuse, rape or incest&quot;.

===== Live Action videos =====
Beginning in 2010, Live Action released several series of undercover videos filmed in Planned Parenthood centers. Live Action said one series showed Planned Parenthood employees at many affiliates actively assisting or being complicit in aiding a prostitution ring, advising patients on how to procure sex-selective abortions, while one who said they would immerse a child born alive after a botched abortion in a chemical solution to make it stop moving and breathing. No criminal convictions resulted, but some Planned Parenthood employees and volunteers were fired for not following procedure, and the organization committed to retraining its staff. Additionally, one center was placed on probation.

===== Center for Medical Progress videos =====


== Violence by anti-abortion activists ==
In the U.S., abortion providers have been threatened with death, and facilities that provide abortions have been attacked or vandalized. Planned Parenthood clinics have been the target of many instances of violence by anti-abortion activists, including but not limited to bombing, arson and attacks with chemical weaponry. In 1994, John Salvi entered a Brookline, Massachusetts Planned Parenthood clinic and opened fire, murdering receptionist Shannon Elizabeth Lowney and wounding three others. He fled to another Planned Parenthood clinic where he murdered Leane Nichols and wounded two others. In 2012, a Grand Chute, Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood clinic was subject to a bombing perpetrated by an unknown individual. In 2015, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Pullman, Washington was heavily damaged by arson.

=== 2015 shooting ===
On November 27, 2015, a gunman shot and killed two civilians and a police officer during a five-hour gun battle at the Colorado Springs, Colorado clinic. The 57-year-old gunman, Robert Dear, surrendered to police and was taken into custody. During his arrest, he gave a &quot;rambling&quot; interview in which, at one point, he said &quot;no more baby parts&quot;, echoing language used in the news media about the clinic following the Center for Medical Progress videos. Dear was declared incompetent to stand trial for the shooting, citing experts&#x27; finding that he has &quot;delusional disorder, persecutory type&quot; and is now confined indefinitely to a state mental hospital.

<text>Forever Eden is an American reality television series broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). The series premiered on March 1, 2004, and it concluded on April 9, 2004. The contestants in the series could live in a resort not for weeks or months, but for years. It was hosted by Ruth England. In the end, contestants Shawna and Wallace won a combined total of $260,000. Brooke and Adam were runners-up.

The show was pulled after seven episodes, leaving eighteen episodes unaired. The remaining episodes were eventually screened in the United States on Fox Reality.

==Format==
Set in Jamaica, the series followed a group of unmarried men and women who lived together at a luxury resort. The contestants, who voluntarily agreed to cease contact with their friends and family, had the opportunity to live at and enjoy the amenities of the resort indefinitely. Contestants accrued a monetary reward pursuant to however long they resided at the resort. This reward, however, was contingent on the contestants remaining at the resort for predetermined periods of time. Contestants had the ability to leave the series at anytime, however, they would no longer receive the reward if they opted to leave. As the series progressed, producers introduced new contestants and guest stars, which included former partners and long-lost relatives of the contestants. The series was hosted by English television presenter Ruth England.

==Production==
The concept for the series stemmed from the reality television series &quot;Paradise Hotel&quot;.

The series was filmed in Jamaica at a cost of $750,000 per episode.

<text>From January 19 to June 8, 2004, voters of the Republican Party chose its nominee for president in the 2004 United States presidential election. Incumbent President George W. Bush was again selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 2004 Republican National Convention held from August 30 to September 2, 2004, in New York City.

== Primary race overview ==
Incumbent President George W. Bush announced in mid-2003 that he would campaign for re-election; he faced no major challengers. He then went on, throughout early 2004, to win every nomination contest, including a sweep of Super Tuesday, beating back the vacuum of challengers and maintaining the recent tradition of an easy primary for incumbent Presidents (the last time an incumbent was seriously challenged in a presidential primary contest was when Senator Ted Kennedy challenged Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1980).

Bush won every state with comfortable margins: his worst performance was in New Hampshire, where he received 79.8% of the vote. The only human challenger to receive over 5% of the vote in any state was Bill Wyatt from California, who received 10% of the vote in Oklahoma in a minor upset. &quot;Uncommitted&quot; also received over 5% of the vote in Massachusetts (8.7%), Rhode Island (12.4%) and Texas (7.5%).

Bush managed to raise US$130 million in 2003 alone, and expected to set a national primary fund-raising record of $200 million by the time of the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City.

Several states and territories canceled their respective Republican primaries altogether, citing Bush being the only candidate to qualify on their respective ballot, including Connecticut, Florida, Mississippi, New York, Puerto Rico, and South Dakota.

Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, an opponent of the war in Iraq, Bush&#x27;s tax cuts, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and much of Bush&#x27;s social agenda, considered challenging Bush in the New Hampshire primary in the fall of 2003. He decided not to run, after the capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003. He would later change his party affiliation to Democratic and run in that party&#x27;s 2016 presidential primaries.

As of the 2024 presidential election, Bush is the last incumbent president, Democrat or Republican, to win all the delegates going into the national convention.

== Candidates ==

=== Nominee ===

=== Challengers ===

==== On the ballot in two or more primaries ====
* William Tsangares ran for president under the pseudonym &quot;Bill Wyatt.&quot; The then-43-year-old T-shirt maker left the Democratic Party to become a Republican after Democrats voted for the war in Iraq, an action he saw as a betrayal. Tsangares traveled 12,000 miles and spent an estimated $20,000 on his presidential campaign. He managed to get on the ballot in New Hampshire, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, and even the Democratic Primary ballot in Arizona. He finished tenth in the New Hampshire primary with 0.23% of the vote (153 votes), placed second in Missouri, where he received 1,268 votes (1.03%). However, a minor upset occurred on Mini-Tuesday when Tsangares won just over 10% of the vote in Oklahoma and 4% in Louisiana. He also received 233 votes (0.10%) in the Arizona Democratic primary.

* Blake Ashby, a Republican entrepreneur frustrated with the explosion of debt under President Bush, ran as a protest candidate in the Republican primaries. On the ballot in New Hampshire and Missouri, he spent approximately $20,000 on his campaign, visiting New Hampshire and campaigning in his home state of Missouri and participated in the C-Span Minor Candidates Forum He finished seventh in New Hampshire with 264 votes and third in Missouri with 981 votes.

==== On the ballot in one primary ====
All but one of the following were on the ballot only in the state of New Hampshire.

==== Declined to be candidates ====


== Results ==
There were 2,509 total delegates to the 2004 Republican National Convention, of which 650 were so-called &quot;superdelegates&quot; who were not bound by any particular state&#x27;s primary or caucus votes and could change their votes at any time. A candidate needs 1,255 delegates to become the nominee. Except for the Northern Mariana Islands and Midway Atoll, all states, territories, and other inhabited areas of the United States offer delegates to the 2004 Republican National Convention.

===Contested primaries===
For brevity, states that did not hold a contest or had Bush as the only option on the ballot are omitted. Only candidates who placed third or better in a primary are included.

<text>The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) is a medium- to larger-sized strepsirrhine (wet-nosed) primate and the most internationally recognized lemur species, owing to its long, black-and-white, ringed tail. It belongs to Lemuridae, one of five lemur families, and is the only member of the Lemur genus. Like all lemurs, it is endemic to the island of Madagascar, where it is endangered. Known locally in Malagasy as &#x27; (, spelled&#x27; in French) or &quot;&quot;, it ranges from gallery forests to spiny scrub in the southern regions of the island. It is omnivorous, as well as the most adapted to living terrestrially of the extant lemurs.

The ring-tailed lemur is highly social, living in groups—known as &quot;troops&quot;—of up to 30 individuals. It is also a female-dominant species, a commonality among lemurs. To keep warm and reaffirm social bonds, groups will huddle together. Mutual grooming is another vital aspect of lemur socialization (as with all primates), reaffirming social and familial connections, while also helping rid each other of any potential insects. Ring-tailed lemurs are strictly diurnal, being active exclusively during daylight hours. Due to this lifestyle, they also sunbathe; the lemurs can be observed sitting upright on their tails, exposing their soft, white belly fur towards the sun. They will often also have their palms open and eyes gently closed. Like other lemurs, this species relies strongly on their sense of smell, and territorial marking, with scent glands, provides communication signals throughout a group&#x27;s home range. The glands are located near the eyes, as well as near the anus. The males perform a unique scent-marking behavior called &quot;spur-marking&quot; and will participate in &quot;stink fights&quot; by dousing their tails with their pheromones and “wafting” them at opponents. Additionally, lemurs of both sexes will scent-mark trees, logs, rocks or other objects by simply rubbing their faces and bodies onto it, not unlike a domestic cat.

As one of the most vocal primates, the ring-tailed lemur uses numerous vocalizations, including calling for group cohesion and predator alarm calls. Experiments have shown that the ring-tailed lemur, despite the lack of a large brain (relative to simiiform primates), can organize sequences, understand basic arithmetic operations, and preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.

Despite adapting to and breeding easily under captive care (and being the most popular species of lemur in zoos worldwide, with more than 2,000 captive-raised individuals), the wild population of ring-tailed lemur is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List, due to habitat destruction, local hunting for bushmeat and the exotic pet trade. As of early 2017, the population in the wild is believed to have crashed to as low as 2,000 individuals due to these reasons, making them far more critically endangered. Local Malagasy farmers and logging industries frequently make use of slash and burn deforestation techniques, with smoke being visible on the horizon on most days in Madagascar, in an effort to accommodate livestock and to cultivate larger fields of crops.

==Etymology==
Although the term &quot;lemur&quot; was first intended for slender lorises, it was soon limited to the endemic Malagasy primates, which have been known as &quot;lemurs&quot; ever since. The name derives from the Latin term &quot;lemures&quot;, which refers to specters or ghosts that were exorcised during the Lemuria festival of ancient Rome. According to Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris. Being familiar with the works of Virgil and Ovid and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term &quot;lemur&quot; for these nocturnal primates. However, it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, reflective eyes, and ghostly cries of lemurs. It has also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that some Malagasy people have held legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors, but this is unlikely given that the name was selected for slender lorises from India. The species name, &quot;catta&quot;, refers to the ring-tailed lemur&#x27;s cat-like appearance. Its purring vocalization is similar to that of the domestic cat.

Following Linnaeus&#x27;s species description, the common name &quot;ring-tailed maucauco&quot; was first penned in 1771 by Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, who noted its characteristic long, banded tail. (The term &quot;maucauco&quot; was a very common term for lemurs at this time.) The now universal English name &quot;ring-tailed lemur&quot; was first used by George Shaw in his illustrated scientific publication covering the Leverian collection, which was published between 1792 and 1796.

==Evolutionary history==
All mammalian fossils from Madagascar come from recent times. Thus, little is known about the evolution of the ring-tailed lemur, let alone the rest of the lemur clade, which comprises the entire endemic primate population of the island. However, chromosomal and molecular evidence suggest that lemurs are more closely related to each other than to other strepsirrhine primates. For this to have happened, it is thought that a very small ancestral population came to Madagascar via a single rafting event between 50 and 80 million years ago. Subsequent evolutionary radiation and speciation has created the diversity of Malagasy lemurs seen today.
According to analysis of amino acid sequences, the branching of the family Lemuridae has been dated to 26.1 ±3.3 mya while rRNA sequences of mtDNA place the split at 24.9 ±3.6 mya. The ruffed lemurs are the first genus to split away (most basal) in the family, a view that is further supported by analysis of DNA sequences and karyotypes. Additionally, Molecular data suggests a deep genetic divergence and sister group relationship between the true lemurs (&quot;Eulemur&quot;) and the other two genera: &quot;Lemur&quot; and &quot;Hapalemur&quot;.

The ring-tailed lemur is thought to share closer affinities to the bamboo lemurs of the genus &quot;Hapalemur&quot; than to the other two genera in its family. This has been supported by comparisons in communication, chromosomes, genetics, and several morphological traits, such as scent gland similarities. However, other data concerning immunology and other morphological traits fail to support this close relationship. For example, &quot;Hapalemur&quot; species have short snouts, while the ring-tailed lemur and the rest of Lemuridae have long snouts. However, differences in the relationship between the orbit (eye socket) and the muzzle suggest that the ring-tailed lemur and the true lemurs evolved their elongated faces independently.

The relationship between the ring-tailed lemur and bamboo lemurs is the least understood. Molecular analysis suggests that either the bamboo lemurs diverged from the ring-tailed lemur, making the group monophyletic and supporting the current two-genera taxonomy, or that the ring-tailed lemur is nested in with the bamboo lemurs, requiring &quot;Hapalemur simus&quot; to be split off into its own genus, &quot;Prolemur&quot;.

The karyotype of the ring-tailed lemur has 56 chromosomes, of which four are metacentric (arms of nearly equal length), four are submetacentric (arms of unequal length), and 46 are acrocentric (the short arm is hardly observable). The X chromosome is metacentric and the Y chromosome is acrocentric.

===Taxonomic classification===
Linnaeus first used the genus name &quot;Lemur&quot; to describe &quot;Lemur tardigradus&quot; (the red slender loris, now known as &quot;Loris tardigradus&quot;) in his 1754 catalog of the Museum of King Adolf Frederick. In 1758, his 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; listed the genus &quot;Lemur&quot; with three included species, only one of which is still considered to be a lemur while another is no longer considered to be a primate. These species include: &quot;Lemur tardigradus&quot;, &quot;Lemur catta&quot; (the ring-tailed lemur), and &quot;Lemur volans&quot; (the Philippine colugo, now known as &quot;Cynocephalus volans&quot;). In 1911, Oldfield Thomas made &quot;Lemur catta&quot; the type species for the genus, despite the term initially being used to describe lorises. On January 10, 1929, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) formalized this decision in its publication of Opinion 122.

The ring-tailed lemur shares many similarities with ruffed lemurs (genus &quot;Varecia&quot;) and true lemurs (genus &quot;Eulemur&quot;), and its skeleton is nearly indistinguishable from that of the true lemurs. Consequently, the three genera were once grouped together in the genus &quot;Lemur&quot; and more recently are sometimes referred to as subfamily Lemurinae (within family Lemuridae). However, ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus &quot;Varecia&quot; in 1962, and due to similarities between the ring-tailed lemur and the bamboo lemurs, particularly in regards to molecular evidence and scent glands similarities, the true lemurs were moved to the genus &quot;Eulemur&quot; by Yves Rumpler and Elwyn L. Simons (1988) as well as Colin Groves and Robert H. Eaglen (1988). In 1991, Ian Tattersall and Jeffrey H. Schwartz reviewed the evidence and came to a different conclusion, instead favoring to return the members of &quot;Eulemur&quot; and &quot;Varecia&quot; to the genus &quot;Lemur&quot;. However, this view was not widely accepted and the genus &quot;Lemur&quot; remained monotypic, containing only the ring-tailed lemur. Because the differences in molecular data are so minute between the ring-tailed lemur and both genera of bamboo lemurs, it has been suggested that all three genera be merged.

Because of the difficulty in discerning the relationships within family Lemuridae, not all authorities agree on the taxonomy, although the majority of the primatological community favors the current classification.

In 1996, researchers Steven Goodman and Olivier Langrand suggested that the ring-tailed lemur may demonstrate regional variations, particularly a high mountain population at Andringitra Massif that has a thicker coat, lighter coloration, and variations in its tail rings. In 2001, primatologist Colin Groves concluded that this does not represent a locally occurring subspecies. This decision was later supported by further fieldwork that showed that the differences fell within the normal range of variation for the species. The thicker coat was considered a local adaptation to extreme low temperatures in the region, and the fading of the fur was attributed to increased exposure to solar radiation. Additional genetic studies in 2000 further supported the conclusion that population did not vary significantly from the other ring-tailed lemur populations on the island.

==Anatomy and physiology==

The ring-tailed lemur is a relatively large lemur. Its average weight is . Its head–body length ranges between , its tail length is , and its total length is . Other measurements include a hind foot length of , ear length of , and cranium length of .

The species has a slender frame and narrow face, fox-like muzzle. The ring-tailed lemur&#x27;s trademark—a long, bushy tail—is ringed in alternating black and white transverse bands, numbering 12 or 13 white rings and 13 or 14 black rings and always ending in a black tip. The total number of rings nearly matches the approximate number of caudal vertebrae (~25). Its tail is longer than its body and is not prehensile. Instead, it is only used for balance, communication, and group cohesion.

The pelage (fur) is so dense that it can clog electric clippers. The ventral (chest) coat and throat are white or cream. The dorsal (back) coat varies from gray to rosy-brown, sometimes with a brown pygal patch around the tail region, where the fur grades to pale gray or grayish brown. The dorsal coloration is slightly darker around the neck and crown. The hair on the throat, cheeks, and ears is white or off-white and also less dense, allowing the dark skin underneath to show through. The muzzle is dark grayish and the nose is black, and the eyes are encompassed by black triangular patches. Facial vibrissae (whiskers) are developed and found above the lips (mystacal), on the cheeks (genal), and on the eyebrow (superciliary). Vibrissae are also found slightly above the wrist on the underside of the forearm. The ears are relatively large compared to other lemurs and are covered in hair, which has only small tufts if any. Although slight pattern variations in the facial region may be seen between individuals, there are no obvious differences between the sexes.

Unlike most diurnal primates, but like all strepsirrhine primates, the ring-tailed lemur has a tapetum lucidum, or reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, that enhances night vision. The tapetum is highly visible in this species because the pigmentation of the ocular fundus (back surface of the eye), which is present in—but varies between—all lemurs, is very spotty. The ring-tailed lemur also has a rudimentary foveal depression on the retina. Another shared characteristic with the other strepsirrhine primates is the rhinarium, a moist, naked, glandular nose supported by the upper jaw and protruding beyond the chin. The rhinarium continues down where it divides the upper lip. The upper lip is attached to the premaxilla, preventing the lip from protruding and thus requiring the lemur to lap water rather than using suction.
The skin of the ring-tailed lemur is dark gray or black in color, even in places where the fur is white. It is exposed on the nose, palms, soles, eyelids, lips, and genitalia. The skin is smooth, but the leathery texture of the hands and feet facilitate terrestrial movement. The anus, located at the joint of the tail, is covered when the tail is lowered. The area around the anus (circumanal area) and the perineum are covered in fur. In males, the scrotum lacks fur, is covered in small, horny spines, and the two sacs of the scrotum are divided. The penis is nearly cylindrical in shape and is covered in small spines, as well as having two pairs of larger spines on both sides. Males have a relatively small baculum (penis bone) compared to their size. The scrotum, penis, and prepuce are usually coated with a foul-smelling secretion. Females have a vulva with a thick, elongated clitoris that protrudes from the labia. The opening of the urethra is closer to the clitoris than the vagina, forming a &quot;drip tip&quot;.

Females have two pairs of mammary glands (four nipples), but only one pair is functional. The anterior pair (closest to the head) are very close to the axillae (armpit). Furless scent glands are present on both males and females. Both sexes have small, dark antebrachial (forearm) glands measuring 1 cm long and located on the inner surface of the forearm nearly above the wrist joint. (This trait is shared between the &quot;Lemur&quot; and &quot;Hapalemur&quot; genera.) The gland is soft and compressible, bears fine dermal ridges (like fingerprints), and is connected to the palm by a fine, 2 mm–high, hairless strip. However, only the male has a horny spur that overlays this scent gland. The spur develops with age through the accumulation of secretions from an underlying gland that may connect through the skin through as many as a thousand minuscule ducts. The males also have brachial (arm) glands on the axillary surface of their shoulders (near the armpit). The brachial gland is larger than the antebrachial gland, covered in short hair around the periphery, and has a naked crescent-shaped orifice near the center. The gland secretes a foul-smelling, brown, sticky substance. The brachial gland is barely developed if present at all in females. Both sexes also have apocrine and sebaceous glands in their genital or perianal regions, which are covered in fur.

Its fingers are slender, padded, mostly lacking webbing, and semi-dexterous with flat, human-like nails. The thumb is both short and widely separated from the other fingers. Despite being set at a right angle to the palm, the thumb is not opposable since the ball of the joint is fixed in place. As with all strepsirrhines, the hand is ectaxonic (the axis passes through the fourth digit) rather than mesaxonic (the axis passing through the third digit) as seen in monkeys and apes. The fourth digit is the longest, and only slightly longer than the second digit. Likewise, the fifth digit is only slightly longer than the second. The palms are long and leathery, and like other primates, they have dermal ridges to improve grip. The feet are semi-digitigrade and more specialized than the hands. The big toe is opposable and is smaller than the big toe of other lemurs, which are more arboreal. The second toe is short, has a small terminal pad, and has a toilet-claw (sometimes referred to as a &quot;grooming claw&quot;) specialized for personal grooming, specifically to rake through fur that is unreachable by the mouth. The toilet-claw is a trait shared among nearly all living strepsirrhine primates. Unlike other lemurs, the ring-tailed lemur&#x27;s heel is not covered by fur.

===Dentition===

The ring-tailed lemur has a dentition of , meaning that on each side of the jaw it has two incisors, one canine tooth, three premolars, and three molar teeth. Its deciduous dentition is . The permanent teeth erupt in the following order: m 1/1 (first molars), i 2/2 (first incisors), i 3/3 (second incisors), C1 (upper canines), m 2/2 (second molars), c1 (lower canines), m 3/3 (third molars), p 4/4 (third premolars), p 3/3 (second premolars), p 2/2 (first premolars).

Its lower incisors (i1 and i2) are long, narrow, and finely spaced while pointing almost straight forward in the mouth (procumbent). Together with the incisor-shaped (incisiform) lower canines (c1), which are slightly larger and also procumbent, form a structure called a toothcomb, a trait unique to nearly all strepsirrhine primates. The toothcomb is used during oral grooming, which involves licking and tooth-scraping. It may also be used for grasping small fruits, removing leaves from the stem when eating, and possibly scraping sap and gum from tree bark. The toothcomb is kept clean using a sublingual organ—a thin, flat, fibrous plate that covers a large part of the base of the tongue. The first lower premolar (p2) following the toothcomb is shaped like a canine (caniniform) and occludes the upper canine, essentially filling the role of the incisiform lower canine. There is also a diastema (gap) between the second and third premolars (p2 and p3).

The upper incisors are small, with the first incisors (I1) space widely from each other, yet closely to the second incisors (I2). Both are compressed buccolingually (between the cheek and the tongue). The upper canines (C1) are long, have a broad base, and curve down and back (recurved). The upper canines exhibit slight sexual dimorphism, with males exhibiting slightly larger canines than females. Both sexes use them in combat by slashing with them. There is a small diastema between the upper canine and the first premolar (P2), which is smaller and more caniniform than the other premolars. Unlike other lemurs, the first two upper molars (M1 and M2) have prominent lingual cingulae, yet do not have a protostyle.

==Ecology==
The ring-tailed lemur is diurnal and semi-terrestrial. It is the most terrestrial of lemur species, spending as much as 33% of its time on the ground. However it is still considerably arboreal, spending 23% of its time in the mid-level canopy, 25% in the upper-level canopy, 6% in the emergent layer and 13% in small bushes. Troop travel is 70% terrestrial.

Troop size, home range, and population density vary by region and food availability. Troops typically range in size from 6 to 25, although troops with over 30 individuals have been recorded. The average troop contains 13 to 15 individuals. Home range size varies between . Troops of the ring-tailed lemur will maintain a territory, but overlap is often high. When encounters occur, they are agonistic, or hostile in nature. A troop will usually occupy the same part of its range for three or four days before moving. When it does move, the average traveling distance is . Population density ranges from 100 individuals per in dry forests to 250–600 individuals per km2 in gallery and secondary forests.

The ring-tailed lemur has both native and introduced predators. Native predators include the fossa (&quot;Cryptoprocta ferox&quot;), the Madagascar harrier-hawk (&quot;Polyboroides radiatus&quot;), the Madagascar buzzard (&quot;Buteo brachypterus&quot;) and the Madagascar ground boa (&quot;Acrantophis madagascariensis&quot;). Introduced predators include the small Indian civet (&quot;Viverricula indica&quot;), the domestic cat and the domestic dog.

===Geographic range and habitat===

Endemic to southern and southwestern Madagascar, the ring-tailed lemur ranges further into highland areas than other lemurs. It inhabits deciduous forests, dry scrub, montane humid forests, and gallery forests (forests along riverbanks). It strongly favors gallery forests, but such forests have now been cleared from much of Madagascar in order to create pasture for livestock. Depending on location, temperatures within its geographic range can vary from at Andringitra Massif to in the spiny forests of Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve.

This species is found as far east as Tôlanaro, inland towards the mountains of Andringitra on the southeastern plateau, among the spiny forests of the southern part of the island, and north along the west coast to the town of Belo sur Mer. Historically, the northern limits of its range in the west extended to the Morondava River near Morondava. It can still be found in Kirindy Mitea National Park, just south of Morondava, though at very low densities. It does not occur in Kirindy Forest Reserve, north of Morondava. Its distribution throughout the rest of its range is very spotty, with population densities varying widely.

The ring-tailed lemur can be easily seen in five national parks in Madagascar: Andohahela National Park, Andringitra National Park, Isalo National Park, Tsimanampetsotse National Park, and Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park. It can also be found in Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve, Kalambatritra Special Reserve, Pic d&#x27;Ivohibe Special Reserve, Amboasary Sud, Berenty Private Reserve, Anja Community Reserve, and marginally at Kirindy Mitea National Park. Unprotected forests that the species has been reported in include Ankoba, Ankodida, Anjatsikolo, Anbatotsilongolongo, Mahazoarivo, Masiabiby, and Mikea.

Within the protected regions it is known to inhabit, the ring-tailed lemur is sympatric (shares its range) with as many as 24 species of lemur, covering every living genus except &quot;Allocebus&quot;, &quot;Indri&quot;, and &quot;Varecia&quot;. Historically, the species used to be sympatric with the critically endangered southern black-and-white ruffed lemur (&quot;Varecia variegata editorum&quot;), which was once found at Andringitra National Park; however, no sightings of the ruffed lemur have been reported in recent years.

In western Madagascar, sympatric ring-tailed lemurs and red-fronted lemurs (&quot;Eulemur rufifrons&quot;) have been studied together. Little interaction takes place between the two species. While the diets of the two species overlap, they eat in different proportions since the ring-tailed lemur has a more varied diet and spends more time on the ground.

===Diet===
The ring-tailed lemur is an opportunistic omnivore primarily eating fruits and leaves, particularly those of the tamarind tree (&quot;Tamarindus indica&quot;), known natively as &quot;kily&quot;. When available, tamarind makes up as much as 50% of the diet, especially during the dry, winter season. The ring-tailed lemur eats from as many as three dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, spider webs, insect cocoons, arthropods (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small vertebrates (birds and chameleons). During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.

==Behavior==

===Social systems===
Ring-tailed lemurs live in groups known as &quot;troops,&quot; which are classified as multi-male groups, with a matriline as the core group. As with most lemurs, females socially dominate males in all circumstances, including feeding priority. Dominance is enforced by lunging, chasing, cuffing, grabbing and biting. Young females do not always inherit their mother&#x27;s rank and young males leave the troop between three and five years of age. Both sexes have separate dominance hierarchies; females have a distinct hierarchy while male rank is correlated with age. Each troop has one to three central, high-ranking adult males who interact with females more than other group males and lead the troop procession with high-ranking females. Recently transferred males, old males or young adult males that have not yet left their natal group are often lower ranking. Staying at the periphery of the group they tend to be marginalized from group activity.
For males, social structure changes can be seasonal. During the six-month period between December and May a few males migrate between groups. Established males transfer on average every 3.5 years, although young males may transfer approximately every 1.4 years. Group fission occurs when groups get too large and resources become scarce.

In the mornings the ring-tailed lemur sunbathes to warm itself. It faces the sun sitting in what is frequently described as a &quot;sun-worshipping&quot; posture or lotus position. However, it sits with its legs extended outward, not cross-legged, and will often support itself on nearby branches. Sunning is often a group activity, particularly during the cold mornings. At night, troops will split into sleeping parties huddling closely together to keep warm.

Despite being quadrupedal the ring-tailed lemur can rear up and balance on its hind legs, usually for aggressive displays. When threatened, the ring-tailed lemur may jump in the air and strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behavior termed &quot;jump fighting&quot;. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviors include a &quot;threat-stare&quot;, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as &quot;pulled-back lips&quot;.

Border disputes with rival troops occur occasionally and it is the dominant female&#x27;s responsibility to defend the troop&#x27;s home range. Agonistic encounters include staring, lunging approaches and occasional physical aggression, and conclude with troop members retreating toward the center of the home range.
====Olfactory communication====

Olfactory communication is critically important for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as &quot;spur-marking&quot;.

In displays of aggression, males engage in a social display behaviour called &quot;stink fighting&quot;, which involves impregnating their tails with secretions from the antebrachial and brachial glands and waving the scented tail at male rivals.

Ring-tailed lemurs have also been shown to mark using urine. Behaviorally, there is a difference between regular urination, where the tail is slightly raised and a stream of urine is produced, and the urine-marking behavior, where the tail is held up in display and only a few drops of urine are used. The urine-marking behavior is typically used by females to mark territory, and has been observed primarily at the edges of the troop&#x27;s territory and in areas where other troops may frequent. The urine marking behavior also is most frequent during the mating season, and may play a role in reproductive communication between groups.

====Auditory communication====

The ring-tailed lemur is one of the most vocal primates and has a complex array of distinct vocalizations used to maintain group cohesion during foraging and alert group members to the presence of a predator. Calls range from simple to complex. An example of a simple call is the purr (), which expresses contentment. A complex call is the sequence of clicks, close-mouth click series (CMCS), open-mouth click series (OMCS) and yaps () used during predator mobbing. Some calls have variants and undergo transitions between variants, such as an infant &quot;whit&quot; (distress call) transitioning from one variant to another ().

The most commonly heard vocalizations are the moan () (low-to-moderate arousal, group cohesion), early-high wail () (moderate-to-high arousal, group cohesion), and clicks () (&quot;location marker&quot; to draw attention).

===Breeding and reproduction===

The ring-tailed lemur is polygynandrous, although the dominant male in the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. Fighting is most common during the breeding season. A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her backside, lifting her tail, and looking at the desired male over her shoulder. Males may inspect the female&#x27;s genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.

The breeding season runs from mid-April to mid-May. Estrus lasts 4 to 6 hours, and females mate with multiple males during this period. Within a troop, females stagger their receptivity so that each female comes into season on a different day during the breeding season, reducing competition for male attention. Females lactate during the wet season, from December through April, when resources are readily available. Females gestate during the dry season, from May through September, when resources are low. Females give birth during seasons where resources, such as flowers, are in peak. Gestation lasts for about 135 days, and parturition occurs in September or occasionally October. In the wild, one offspring is the norm, although twins may occur. Ring-tailed lemur infants have a birth weight of and are carried ventrally (on the chest) for the first 1 to 2 weeks, then dorsally (on the back).

The young lemurs begin to eat solid food after two months and are fully weaned after five months. Sexual maturity is reached between 2.5 and 3 years. Male involvement in infant rearing is limited, although the entire troop, regardless of age or sex, can be seen caring for the young. Alloparenting between troop females has been reported. Kidnapping by females and infanticide by males also occur occasionally. Due to harsh environmental conditions, predation and accidents such as falls, infant mortality can be as high as 50% within the first year and as few as 30% may reach adulthood. The longest-lived ring-tailed lemur in the wild was a female at the Berenty Reserve who lived for 20 years. In the wild, females rarely live past the age of 16, whereas the life expectancy of males is not known due to their social structure. The longest-lived male was reported to be 15 years old. The maximum lifespan reported in captivity was 27 years.

===Cognitive abilities and tool use===
Historically, the studies of learning and cognition in non-human primates have focused on simians (monkeys and apes), while strepsirrhine primates, such as the ring-tailed lemur and its allies, have been overlooked and popularly dismissed as unintelligent. A couple of factors stemming from early experiments have played a role in the development of this assumption. First, the experimental design of older tests may have favored the natural behavior and ecology of simians over that of strepsirrhines, making the experimental tasks inappropriate for lemurs. For example, simians are known for their manipulative play with non-food objects, whereas lemurs are only known to manipulate non-food objects in captivity. This behavior is usually connected with food association. Also, lemurs are known to displace objects with their nose or mouth more so than with their hands. Therefore, an experiment requiring a lemur to manipulate an object without prior training would favor simians over strepsirrhines. Second, individual ring-tailed lemurs accustomed to living in a troop may not respond well to isolation for laboratory testing. Past studies have reported hysterical behavior in such scenarios.

The notion that lemurs are unintelligent has been perpetuated by the view that the neocortex ratio (as a measure of brain size) indicates intelligence. In fact, primatologist Alison Jolly noted early in her academic career that some lemur species, such as the ring-tailed lemur, have evolved a social complexity similar to that of cercopithecine monkeys, but not the corresponding intelligence. After years of observations of wild ring-tailed lemur populations at the Berenty Reserve in Madagascar and as well as baboons in Africa, she more recently concluded that this highly social lemur species does not demonstrate the equivalent social complexity of cercopithecine monkeys, despite general appearances.

Regardless, research has continued to illuminate the complexity of the lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the ring-tailed lemur. As early as the mid-1970s, studies had demonstrated that they could be trained through operant conditioning using standard schedules of reinforcement. The species has been shown to be capable of learning pattern, brightness, and object discrimination, skills common among vertebrates. The ring-tailed lemur has also been shown to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.

More recently, research at the Duke Lemur Center has shown that the ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur&#x27;s reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.

Since tool use is considered to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.

==Conservation status==
In addition to being listed as &quot;endangered&quot; in 2014 by the IUCN, the ring-tailed lemur has been listed since 1977 by CITES under Appendix I, which makes trade of wild-caught specimens illegal. Although there are more endangered species of lemur, the ring-tailed lemur is considered a flagship species due to its recognizability. As of 2017, only about 2,000 ring-tailed lemurs are estimated to be left in the wild, making the threat of extinction far more serious for them than previously believed.
Three factors threaten ring-tailed lemurs. First and foremost is habitat destruction. Starting nearly 2,000 years ago with the introduction of humans to the island, forests have been cleared to produce pasture and agricultural land. Extraction of hardwoods for fuel and lumber, as well mining and overgrazing, have also taken their toll. Today, it is estimated that 90% of Madagascar&#x27;s original forest cover has been lost. Rising populations have created even greater demand in the southwest portion of the island for fuel wood, charcoal, and lumber. Fires from the clearing of grasslands, as well as slash-and-burn agriculture destroy forests. Another threat to the species is harvesting either for food (bushmeat), fur clothing or pets. Finally, periodic drought common to southern Madagascar can impact populations already in decline. In 1991 and 1992, for example, a severe drought caused an abnormally high mortality rate among infants and females at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve. Two years later, the population had declined by 31% and took nearly four years to start to recover.

The ring-tailed lemur resides in several protected areas within its range, each offering varying levels of protection. At the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, a holistic approach to in-situ conservation has been taken. Not only does field research and resource management involve international students and local people (including school children), livestock management is used at the peripheral zones of the reserve and ecotourism benefits the local people.

Outside of its diminishing habitat and other threats, the ring-tailed lemur reproduces readily and has fared well in captivity. For this reason, along with its popularity, it has become the most populous lemur in zoos worldwide, with more than 2500 in captivity as of 2009. It is also the most common of all captive primates. Ex situ facilities actively involved in the conservation of the ring-tailed lemur include the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina, the Lemur Conservation Foundation in Myakka City, Florida, and the Madagascar Fauna Group headquartered at the Saint Louis Zoo. Due to the high success of captive breeding, reintroduction is a possibility if wild populations were to crash. Although experimental releases have met success on St. Catherines Island in Georgia, demonstrating that captive lemurs can readily adapt to their environment and exhibit a full range of natural behaviors, captive release is not currently being considered.

Ring-tailed lemur populations can also benefit from drought intervention, due to the availability of watering troughs and introduced fruit trees, as seen at the Berenty Private Reserve in southern Madagascar. However, these interventions are not always seen favorably, since natural population fluctuations are not permitted. The species is thought to have evolved its high fecundity due to its harsh environment.

==Cultural references==

The ring-tailed lemur is known locally in Malagasy as &#x27; (pronounced , and spelled &quot;maki&quot; in French) or &#x27; (pronounced or colloquially ). Being the most widely recognized endemic primate on the island, it has been selected as the symbol for Madagascar National Parks (formerly known as ANGAP). The &quot;Maki&quot; brand, which started by selling T-shirts in Madagascar and now sells clothing across the Indian Ocean islands, is named after this lemur due to its popularity, even though the company&#x27;s logo portrays the face of a sifaka and its name uses the French spelling.

The first mention of the ring-tailed lemur in Western literature came in 1625 when English traveller and writer Samuel Purchas described them as being comparable in size to a monkey and having a fox-like long tail with black and white rings. Charles Catton included the species in his 1788 book &quot;Animals Drawn from Nature and Engraved in Aqua-tinta&quot;, calling it the &quot;Maucauco&quot; and regarding it as a type of monkey.

The species was further popularized by the Animal Planet television series &quot;Lemur Street&quot;, as well as by the character King Julien in the animated &quot;Madagascar&quot; film and TV franchise. The ring-tailed lemur was also the focus of the 1996 &quot;Nature&quot; documentary &quot;A Lemur&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which was filmed at the Berenty Reserve and followed a troop of lemurs. The troop included a special infant named Sapphire, who was nearly albino, with white fur, bright blue eyes, and the characteristic ringed tail.

A Ring-tailed lemur played a role in the 1997 comedy film &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;, starring John Cleese, who has a passion for lemurs. Cleese later hosted the 1998 BBC documentary &quot;In the Wild: Operation Lemur with John Cleese&quot;, which tracked the progress of a reintroduction of black-and-white ruffed lemurs back into the Betampona Reserve in Madagascar. The project had been partly funded by Cleese&#x27;s donation of the proceeds from the London premier of &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;.

<text>Martin Buser (born March 29, 1958) is a champion of sled dog racing.

Born in Winterthur, Switzerland, Buser began mushing at age seventeen in Switzerland. In 1979, he moved to Alaska to train and raise sled dogs full-time. His training operation, Happy Trails Kennels, is located in Big Lake, Alaska.

He entered his first Iditarod in 1980, and has run every race since 1986, his third Iditarod. Buser has won the event four times, in 1992, 1994, 1997, and 2002. On sixteen occasions, he has finished among the top ten finishers. He ran the fastest finish time on the previous route which was a longer race than it is now. In 2002, the race started in Wasilla. Now it starts in Willow, making the race about 80 miles shorter. In 2002, his team completed the 80 mile longer race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds. He entered his first Yukon Quest in 2009 and finished in fourth place, earning him &quot;Rookie of the Year.&quot; As of 2017, he has the most consecutive race finishes, 31. He was one of the mushers featured in a documentary about the 2008 Iditarod; in that same race, Martin&#x27;s son Rohn competed for the first time. 

His sense of humor and positive outlook have made him a fan favorite. In 2008, he comically caused quite a stir among fans worldwide when he accidentally gave his GPS unit to a pilot who was transporting dogs and equipment to and from a checkpoint, when the race was first introducing GPS tracking on the racers so fans could follow their paths live.

Martin also has a happy-go-lucky way about him. It shows most clearly when he talks in highly exaggerated tone of voice to his dogs. Other top competitors in the Iditarod, like DeeDee Jonrowe and Aliy Zirkle have found this method to work well in communicating with their dogs.

== Controversy ==
Buser has come under scrutiny for Kuskokwim 300 race violations two years running. Most recently, Buser was caught taking short cuts and accepting help in the care of his dogs in the 2016 Kuskokwim 300. While Buser denies intentionally straying from the course, he has been officially penalized by the Kusokwim 300 Race Committee causing him to place last.

<doc id="503209" wikidata="Q11081100" url="?curid=503209" title="Spoofing attack">
<text>In the context of information security, and especially network security, a spoofing attack is a situation in which a person or program successfully identifies as another by falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage.

==Internet==
=== Spoofing and TCP/IP ===

Many of the protocols in the TCP/IP suite do not provide mechanisms for authenticating the source or destination of a message, leaving them vulnerable to spoofing attacks when extra precautions are not taken by applications to verify the identity of the sending or receiving host. IP spoofing and ARP spoofing in particular may be used to leverage man-in-the-middle attacks against hosts on a computer network. Spoofing attacks which take advantage of TCP/IP suite protocols may be mitigated with the use of firewalls capable of deep packet inspection or by taking measures to verify the identity of the sender or recipient of a message.

===Domain name spoofing===

The term &#x27;Domain name spoofing&#x27; (or simply though less accurately, &#x27;Domain spoofing&#x27;) is used generically to describe one or more of a class of phishing attacks that depend on falsifying or misrepresenting an internet domain name. These are designed to persuade unsuspecting users into visiting a web site other than that intended, or opening an email that is not in reality from the address shown (or apparently shown). Although website and email spoofing attacks are more widely known, any service that relies on domain name resolution may be compromised.

=== Referrer spoofing ===

Some websites, especially pornographic paysites, allow access to their materials only from certain approved (login-) pages. This is enforced by checking the referrer header of the HTTP request. This referrer header, however, can be changed (known as &quot;referrer spoofing&quot; or &quot;Ref-tar spoofing&quot;), allowing users to gain unauthorized access to the materials.

=== Poisoning of file-sharing networks ===
&quot;Spoofing&quot; can also refer to copyright holders placing distorted or unlistenable versions of works on file-sharing networks.

=== E-mail address spoofing ===
The sender information shown in e-mails (the codice_1 field) can be spoofed easily. This technique is commonly used by spammers to hide the origin of their e-mails and leads to problems such as misdirected bounces (i.e. e-mail spam backscatter).

E-mail address spoofing is done in quite the same way as writing a forged return address using snail mail. As long as the letter fits the protocol, (i.e. stamp, postal code) the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) will send the message. It can be done using a mail server with telnet.

=== Geolocation===
Geolocation spoofing occurs when a user applies technologies to make their device appear to be located somewhere other than where it is actually located. The most common geolocation spoofing is through the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or DNS Proxy in order for the user to appear to be located in a different country, state or territory other than where they are actually located. According to a study by GlobalWebIndex, 49% of global VPN users utilize VPNs primarily to access territorially restricted entertainment content. This type of geolocation spoofing is also referred to as geo-piracy, since the user is illicitly accessing copyrighted materials via geolocation spoofing technology. Another example of geolocation spoofing occurred when an online poker player in California used geolocation spoofing techniques to play online poker in New Jersey, in contravention of both California and New Jersey state law. Forensic geolocation evidence proved the geolocation spoofing and the player forfeited more than $90,000 in winnings.

==Telephony==
=== Caller ID spoofing ===

Public telephone networks often provide caller ID information, which includes the caller&#x27;s number and sometimes the caller&#x27;s name, with each call. However, some technologies (especially in Voice over IP (VoIP) networks) allow callers to forge caller ID information and present false names and numbers. Gateways between networks that allow such spoofing and other public networks then forward that false information. Since spoofed calls can originate from other countries, the laws in the receiver&#x27;s country may not apply to the caller. This limits laws&#x27; effectiveness against the use of spoofed caller ID information to further a scam.

== Global navigation satellite system spoofing ==
A global navigation satellite system (GNSS) spoofing attack attempts to deceive a GNSS receiver by broadcasting fake GNSS signals, structured to resemble a set of normal GNSS signals, or by rebroadcasting genuine signals captured elsewhere or at a different time. Spoofing attacks are generally harder to detect as adversaries generate counterfeit signals. These spoofed signals are challenging to recognize from legitimate signals, thus confusing ships&#x27; calculation of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). This means that spoofed signals may be modified in such a way as to cause the receiver to estimate its position to be somewhere other than where it actually is, or to be located where it is but at a different time, as determined by the attacker. One common form of a GNSS spoofing attack, commonly termed a carry-off attack, begins by broadcasting signals synchronized with the genuine signals observed by the target receiver. The power of the counterfeit signals is then gradually increased and drawn away from the genuine signals. 

Even though GNSS is one of the most relied upon navigational systems, it has demonstrated critical vulnerabilities towards spoofing attacks. GNSS satellite signals have been shown to be vulnerable due to the signals’ being relatively weak on Earth’s surface, making GNSS signals ultimate targets for spoofing attacks. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the systems are continuously and recklessly deemed trustworthy even though there, at present, are no means of protecting the systems, signals, or safely guarding vessels against malicious spoofing attacks. Resultingly, the reliance upon systems such as GNSS has opened the door for outside attackers to send malicious commands that could result in the loss of human lives, environmental contamination, navigation accidents, and financial costs. However, seeing as more than 80% of global trade is moved through shipping companies, relying upon GNSS systems for navigation is necessary even though maritime vessels will be vulnerable to spoofing attacks with limited countermeasures.

All GNSS systems, such as the US GPS, Russia&#x27;s GLONASS, China&#x27;s BeiDou, and Europe&#x27;s Galileo constellation, are vulnerable to this technique. It has been suggested that in order to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities the GNSS systems face concerning spoofing attacks, the use of more than one navigational system at once is recommended.

It was suggested that the December 2011 capture of a Lockheed RQ-170 drone aircraft in northeastern Iran was the result of such an attack. GNSS spoofing attacks had been predicted and discussed in the GNSS community as early as 2003. A &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; attack was successfully performed in June 2013, when the luxury yacht &quot;White Rose of Drachs&quot; was misdirected with spoofed GPS signals by a group of aerospace engineering students from the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas in Austin. The students were aboard the yacht, allowing their spoofing equipment to gradually overpower the signal strengths of the actual GPS constellation satellites, altering the course of the yacht.

In 2019, the British oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; was the target of a spoofing attack that directed the ship into Iranian waters where it was seized by Iranian forces. Consequently, the vessel including its crew and cargo were used as pawns in a geopolitical conflict. Several shipping companies with vessels navigating around Iranian waters are instructing vessels to transit dangerous areas with high speed and during daylight.

On October 15, 2023, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that GPS had been “restricted in active combat zones in accordance with various operational needs,” but has not publicly commented on more advanced interference. In April 2024, however, researchers at University of Texas at Austin detected false signals and traced their origin to a particular air base in Israel run by the IDF.

===Russian GPS spoofing===

In June 2017, approximately twenty ships in the Black Sea complained of GPS anomalies, showing vessels to be transpositioned miles from their actual location, in what Professor Todd Humphreys believed was most likely a spoofing attack. GPS anomalies around Putin&#x27;s Palace and the Moscow Kremlin, demonstrated in 2017 by a Norwegian journalist on air, have led researchers to believe that Russian authorities use GPS spoofing wherever Vladimir Putin is located.

The mobile systems named Borisoglebsk-2, Krasukha and Zhitel are reported to be able to spoof GPS.

Incidents involving Russian GPS spoofing include during a November 2018 NATO exercise in Finland that led to ship collision (unconfirmed by authorities). and a 2019 incident of spoofing from Syria by the Russian military that affected the civil airport in Tel Aviv.

In December of 2022 significant GPS interference in several Russian cities was reported by the GPSJam service; the interference was attributed to defensive measures taken by Russian authorities in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

===GPS spoofing with SDR===
Since the advent of software-defined radio (SDR), GPS simulator applications have been made available to the general public. This has made GPS spoofing much more accessible, meaning it can be performed at limited expense and with a modicum of technical knowledge. Whether this technology applies to other GNSS systems remains to be demonstrated.

===Preventing GNSS spoofing===
The Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the National Coordinating Center for Communications (NCC), released a paper which lists methods to prevent this type of spoofing. Some of the most important and most recommended to use are:
#Obscure antennas. Install antennas where they are not visible from publicly accessible locations or obscure their exact locations by introducing impediments to hide the antennas.
#Add a sensor/blocker. Sensors can detect characteristics of interference, jamming, and spoofing signals, provide local indication of an attack or anomalous condition, communicate alerts to a remote monitoring site, and collect and report data to be analyzed for forensic purposes.
#Extend data spoofing whitelists to sensors. Existing data spoofing whitelists have been and are being implemented in government reference software, and should also be implemented in sensors.
#Use more GNSS signal types. Modernized civil GPS signals are more robust than the L1 signal and should be leveraged for increased resistance to interference, jamming, and spoofing.
#Reduce latency in recognition and reporting of interference, jamming, and spoofing. If a receiver is misled by an attack before the attack is recognized and reported, then backup devices may be corrupted by the receiver before hand-over.
These installation and operation strategies and development opportunities can significantly enhance the ability of GPS receivers and associated equipment to defend against a range of interference, jamming, and spoofing attacks.
A system and receiver agnostic detection software offers applicability as cross-industry solution. Software implementation can be performed in different places within the system, depending on where the GNSS data is being used, for example as part of the device&#x27;s firmware, operating system, or on the application level.

A method proposed by researchers from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park and the School of Optical and Electronic Information at Huazhong University of Science and Technology that aims to help mitigate the effects of GNSS spoofing attacks by using data from a vehicles controller area network (CAN) bus. The information would be compared to that of received GNSS data and compared in order to detect the occurrence of a spoofing attack and to reconstruct the driving path of the vehicle using that collected data. Properties such as the vehicles speed and steering angle would be amalgamated and regression modeled in order to achieve a minimum error in position of 6.25 meters. Similarly, a method outlined by researchers in a 2016 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium conference paper discuss the idea of using cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications in order to achieve a similar goal. In this method, the communication abilities of both cars and radar measurements are used to compare against the supplied GNSS position of both cars to determine the distance between the two cars which is then compared to the radar measurements and checked to make sure they match. If the two lengths match within a threshold value, then no spoofing has occurred, but above this threshold, the user is notified so that s/he can take action.

== Voice spoofing ==
Information technology plays an increasingly large role in today&#x27;s world, and different authentication methods are used for restricting access to informational resources, including voice biometrics. Examples of using speaker recognition systems include internet banking systems, customer identification during a call to a call center, as well as passive identification of a possible criminal using a preset &quot;blacklist&quot;.

Technologies related to the synthesis and modeling of speech are developing very quickly, allowing one to create voice recordings almost indistinguishable from real ones. Such services are called Text-to-Speech (TTS) or Style transfer services. The first one aimed at creating a new person. The second one aimed at identifies as another in voice identification systems.

A large number of scientists are busy developing algorithms that would be able to distinguish the synthesized voice of the machine from the real one. On the other hand, these algorithms need to be thoroughly tested to make sure that the system really works. However, an early study has shown that feature design and masking augmentation have a significant impact on the ability to detect spoofed voice.

== Facial recognition spoofing ==
Facial recognition technology is widely employed in various areas, including immigration checks and phone security, as well as on popular platforms like Airbnb and Uber to verify individuals&#x27; identities. However, the increased usage has rendered the system more susceptible to attacks, given the widespread integration of facial recognition systems in society. Some online sources and tutorials detail methods for tricking facial recognition systems through practices known as face spoofing or presentation attacks, which can pose risks in terms of unauthorized access. To mitigate these dangers, measures such as liveness checks (verifying blinking), deep learning, and specialized cameras like 3D cameras have been introduced to prevent facial recognition spoofing. It is important to implement comprehensive security procedures like these to protect against face spoofing attempts and uphold the overall security and integrity of systems relying on facial recognition authentication.

<text>The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is the United States Department of Agriculture agency that was formed by merging the farm loan portfolio and staff of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) and the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS). The Farm Service Agency implements agricultural policy, administers credit and loan programs, and manages conservation, commodity, disaster, and farm marketing programs through a national network of offices. The Administrator of FSA reports to the under secretary of agriculture for farm production and conservation. The current administrator is Zach Ducheneaux. The FSA of each state is led by a politically appointed state executive director (SED).

==History==
Toned as it proved too controversial, expensive, and showed no signs of success. In 1937, the Administration was transformed into the Farm Security Administration and switched focus to the Standard Rural Rehabilitation Loan Program, which provided credits, farm management and technical supervision to rural farmers.

Another predecessor of the FSA was the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1933, which was intended as a program to help stabilize farm prices via price support loans to create crop reduction. The initial act was ruled unconstitutional in 1936 by &quot;United States v. Butler&quot;, but these issues were taken care of by the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, passed two years later.

Following Pearl Harbor and America&#x27;s entry into World War II, the War Food Administration was created to assist in the production and transportation of food for both civilian and military use. At the end of the war, the WFA was reformed into the Production and Marketing Administration.

The first attempt to consolidate the various farm agencies occurred in 1946, as the Farmers Home Administration act merged the Farm Security Administration and the Emergency Crop and Feed Loan Division of the Farm Credit Administration to form the Farmer Home Administration. The act also granted the organization the authority to ensure loans to farmers from other lenders, and later legislation established lending for rural housing, rural business enterprises, and rural water and waste disposal agencies.

The USDA reorganization of 1953 also saw changes to the FHA, including renaming it the Commodity Stabilization Service. As part of the changes, the organization began to focus on the preservation of farm income. As part of their new goals, the Commodity Stabilization Service began conservation programs such as the soil bank. The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committees were also formed out of the community, county, and state committees focused on conservation. By 1961, the CCS was renamed the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, as the agency had become more focused on conservation efforts. The ASCS remained active in assisting with their previous programs and the network of field offices.

1994 saw the reorganization of the USDA, which in turn resulted in the Consolidated Farm Service Agency, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Farmers Home Administration, and Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service being merged into the modern Farm Service Agency.

Today, the committees often oversee activities in multi-county areas, due to USDA reorganization and consolidation of its field office structure into a network of about 2,500 field service centers. The committees are responsible for hiring and supervising the county executive director (CED), who manages the day-to-day activities of the field service center and its employees. 

==&quot;Pigford v. Glickman&quot;==
In the 1930s, Congress set up a unique system under which federal farm programs are administered locally; this was influenced by the powerful Southern bloc in Congress, who represented only white Democrats from their home districts. White control of this program in counties across the South deprived many black farmers of potential benefits, as blacks had been politically disenfranchised at the turn of the century.

Farmers who are eligible to participate in these programs elect a three to five-person county committee, which reviews county office operations and makes decisions on how to apply for the programs. County committees are panels of three to five farmers, elected by other farmers, to oversee the local operation of commodity programs, disaster assistance, and other programs of the Farm Service Agency. County committees, established by the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-46), are so named because they have overseen USDA field offices for farmers that once existed in most rural farm counties throughout the United States.

In the South, black farmers were not commonly elected to county committees and were discriminated against in the administration of farm programs. A class-action lawsuit, &quot;Pigford v. Glickman,&quot; was settled in 1999 to gain compensation for African-American farmers who had been damaged by such discrimination from 1981 to 1996. USDA&#x27;s own investigation had shown widespread discrimination in the programs. The USDA paid more than $2 billion to settle thousands of claims of discrimination.

==Shared Appreciation Agreement==
A Shared Appreciation Agreement (SAA) is an agreement between the USDA and farmer borrowers, instituted when a borrower is severely delinquent on making payments on FSA real estate loans. Such an agreement allows for the forgiveness of a portion or all of the indebtedness, in return for the borrower sharing with USDA at the end of the term a portion of any appreciation in the farmer-owned real estate that served as collateral for the loan. SAAs were instituted as part of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (P. L. 100-233) for the purpose of avoiding foreclosure due to the drop in land prices at that time.

==Publications==
The majority of the Farm Service Agency’s publications are related to the various programs that are run by them. Most of these publications are brochures or other material that discuss the programs&#x27; applications and success.

<text>A pseudepigraph (also anglicized as &quot;pseudepigraphon&quot;) is a falsely attributed work, a text whose claimed author is not the true author, or a work whose real author attributed it to a figure of the past. The name of the author to whom the work is falsely attributed is often prefixed with the particle &quot;pseudo-&quot;, such as for example &quot;pseudo-Aristotle&quot; or &quot;pseudo-Dionysius&quot;: these terms refer to the anonymous authors of works falsely attributed to Aristotle and Dionysius the Areopagite, respectively.

In biblical studies, the term &quot;pseudepigrapha&quot; can refer to an assorted collection of Jewish religious works thought to be written 300 BCE to 300 CE. They are distinguished by Protestants from the deuterocanonical books (Catholic and Orthodox) or Apocrypha (Protestant), the books that appear in extant copies of the Septuagint in the fourth century or later and the Vulgate, but not in the Hebrew Bible or in Protestant Bibles. The Catholic Church distinguishes only between the deuterocanonical and all other books; the latter are called biblical apocrypha, which in Catholic usage includes the pseudepigrapha. In addition, two books considered canonical in the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, the Book of Enoch and Book of Jubilees, are categorized as pseudepigrapha from the point of view of Chalcedonian Christianity.

In addition to the sets of generally agreed to be non-canonical works, scholars will also apply the term to canonical works who make a direct claim of authorship, yet this authorship is doubted. For example, the Book of Daniel is considered by some to have been written in the 2nd century BCE, 400 years after the prophet Daniel lived, and thus the work is pseudepigraphic. A New Testament example might be the book of 2 Peter, considered by some to be written approximately 80 years after Saint Peter&#x27;s death. Early Christians, such as Origen, harbored doubts as to the authenticity of the book&#x27;s authorship.

The term has also been used by some Muslims to describe hadiths; who claim that most hadiths are fabrications created in the 8th and 9th century CE, and falsely attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad (see Quranism).

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pseudepigraph&quot; (from the , &quot;pseudḗs&quot;, &quot;false&quot; and , &quot;epigraphḗ&quot;, &quot;name&quot; or &quot;inscription&quot; or &quot;ascription&quot;; thus when taken together it means &quot;false superscription or title&quot;; see the related &quot;epigraphy&quot;). The plural of &quot;pseudepigraph&quot; (sometimes Latinized as &quot;pseudepigraphon&quot; or &quot;pseudepigraphum&quot;) is &quot;pseudepigrapha&quot;.

==Naming==
When a text is shown to have been falsely attributed to a particular author, and the true identity of the author is not known, the author can be referred to by a combination of &quot;pseudo-&quot; and the traditional authors name. For example, the &quot;Armenian History&quot; has been falsely attributed to an Armenian historian named seventh-century Sebeos, and it is therefore called Pseudo-Sebeos.

==Levels of authenticity==
Scholars have identified seven levels of authenticity which they have organized in a hierarchy ranging from literal authorship, meaning written in the author&#x27;s own hand, to outright forgery:
# Literal authorship. A church leader writes a letter in his own hand.
# Dictation. A church leader dictates a letter almost word for word to an amanuensis.
# Delegated authorship. A church leader describes the basic content of an intended letter to a disciple or to an amanuensis.
# Posthumous authorship. A church leader dies, and his disciples finish a letter that he had intended to write, sending it posthumously in his name.
# Apprentice authorship. A church leader dies, and disciples who had been authorized to speak for him while he was alive continue to do so by writing letters in his name years or decades after his death.
# Honorable pseudepigraphy. A church leader dies, and admirers seek to honor him by writing letters in his name as a tribute to his influence and in a sincere belief that they are responsible bearers of his tradition.
# Forgery. A church leader obtains sufficient prominence that, either before or after his death, people seek to exploit his legacy by forging letters in his name, presenting him as a supporter of their own ideas.

==Classical and biblical studies==

===Old Testament and intertestamental studies===

In biblical studies, &quot;pseudepigrapha&quot; refers particularly to works which purport to be written by noted authorities in either the Old and New Testaments or by persons involved in Jewish or Christian religious study or history. These works can also be written about biblical matters, often in such a way that they appear to be as authoritative as works which have been included in the many versions of the Judeo-Christian scriptures. Eusebius indicates this usage dates back at least to Serapion of Antioch, whom Eusebius records as having said: &quot;But those writings which are falsely inscribed with their name (&quot;ta pseudepigrapha&quot;), we as experienced persons reject...&quot;

Many such works were also referred to as &quot;Apocrypha&quot;, which originally connoted &quot;private&quot; or &quot;non-public&quot;: those that were not endorsed for public reading in the liturgy. An example of a text that is both apocryphal and pseudepigraphical is the &quot;Odes of Solomon&quot;. It is considered pseudepigraphical because it was not actually written by Solomon but instead is a collection of early Christian (first to second century) hymns and poems, originally written not in Hebrew, and apocryphal because they were not accepted in either the Tanakh or the New Testament.

There is a tendency not to use the word &quot;pseudepigrapha&quot; when describing works later than about 300 CE when referring to biblical matters. But the late-appearing &quot;Gospel of Barnabas&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius&quot;, the &quot;Pseudo-Apuleius&quot; (author of a fifth-century herbal ascribed to Apuleius), and the author traditionally referred to as the &quot;Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite&quot;, are classic examples of pseudepigraphy. In the fifth century the moralist Salvian published &quot;Contra avaritiam&quot; (&quot;Against avarice&quot;) under the name of Timothy; the letter in which he explained to his former pupil, Bishop Salonius, his motives for so doing survives.

The term pseudepigrapha is also commonly used to describe numerous works of Jewish religious literature written from about 300 BCE to 300 CE. Not all of these works are actually pseudepigraphical. It also refers to books of the New Testament canon whose authorship is misrepresented. Such works include the following:
* 3 Maccabees
* 4 Maccabees
* Assumption of Moses
* Ethiopic Book of Enoch (1 Enoch)
* Slavonic Second Book of Enoch
* Book of Jubilees
* 3 Baruch
* Letter of Aristeas
* Life of Adam and Eve
* Ascension of Isaiah
* Psalms of Solomon
* Sibylline Oracles
* 2 Baruch
* Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs
* 4 Ezra

Various canonical works accepted as scripture have since been reexamined and considered by modern scholars in the 19th century onward as likely cases of pseudepigraphica. The Book of Daniel directly claims to be written by the prophet Daniel, yet there are strong reasons to believe it was not written until centuries after Daniel&#x27;s death, such as references to the book only appearing from the 2nd century BCE onward. The book is an apocalypse wherein Daniel offers a series of predictions of the future, and is meant to reassure the Jews of the period that the tyrant Antiochus IV Epiphanes would soon be overthrown. By backdating the book to the 6th century BCE and providing a series of correct prophecies as to the history of the past 400 years, the authorship claim of Daniel would have strengthened a later author&#x27;s predictions of the coming fall of the Seleucid Empire.

===New Testament studies===
Christian scholars traditionally maintain that nothing known to be pseudepigraphical was admitted to the New Testament canon.

The Catholic Encyclopedia notes,
The first four historical books of the New Testament are supplied with titles, which however ancient, do not go back to the respective authors of those sacred texts. The Canon of Muratori, Clement of Alexandria, and St. Irenaeus bear distinct witness to the existence of those headings in the latter part of the second century of our era. Indeed, the manner in which Clement (Strom. I, xxi), and St. Irenaeus (Adv. Haer. III, xi, 7) employ them implies that, at that early date, our present titles to the gospels had been in current use for some considerable time. Hence, it may be inferred that they were prefixed to the evangelical narratives as early as the first part of that same century. That however, they do not go back to the first century of the Christian era, or at least that they are not original, is a position generally held at the present day. It is felt that since they are similar for the four Gospels, although the same Gospels were composed at some interval from each other, those titles were not framed and consequently not prefixed to each individual narrative, before the collection of the four Gospels was actually made. Besides as well pointed out by Prof. Bacon, &quot;the historical books of the New Testament differ from its apocalyptic and epistolary literature, as those of the Old Testament differ from its prophecy, in being invariably anonymous, and for the same reason. Prophecies, whether in the earlier or in the later sense, and letters, to have authority, must be referable to some individual; the greater his name, the better. But history was regarded as common possession. Its facts spoke for themselves. Only as the springs of common recollection began to dwindle, and marked differences to appear between the well-informed and accurate Gospels and the untrustworthy ... become worth while for the Christian teacher or apologist to specify whether the given representation of the current tradition was &#x27;according to&#x27; this or that special compiler, and to state his qualifications&quot;. It thus appears that the present titles of the Gospels are not traceable to the Evangelists themselves.

However, agnostic biblical scholar Bart D. Ehrman holds that only seven of Paul&#x27;s epistles are convincingly genuine, and that all of the other 20 books in the New Testament appear to be written by unknown people who were not the well-known biblical figures to whom the early Christian leaders originally attributed authorship. The earliest and best manuscripts of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were all written anonymously. Furthermore, the books of Acts, Hebrews, 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John were also written anonymously.

====Pauline epistles====

Thirteen New Testament letters are attributed to Paul and are still considered by Christians to carry Paul&#x27;s authority. These letters are part of the Christian Bible and are foundational for the Christian Church. Therefore, letters which some claim to be pseudepigraphic are not considered any less valuable to Christians. 

Authorship of 6 out of the 13 canonical epistles of Paul has been questioned by both Christian and non-Christian biblical scholars. These are the Epistle to the Ephesians, Epistle to the Colossians, Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, First Epistle to Timothy, Second Epistle to Timothy, and Epistle to Titus. These six books are referred by sceptical scholars such as Bart Ehrman as &quot;deutero-Pauline letters&quot;, meaning &quot;secondary&quot; standing in the corpus of Paul&#x27;s writings, on the grounds of proposed evidence that they could not have been written by Paul, despite internal attribution to Paul. Those known as the &quot;Pastoral Epistles&quot; (Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus) are all so similar that they are thought to be written by the same unknown author, either by Paul or in Paul&#x27;s name.

====Catholic epistles====

Seven New Testament letters are attributed to several apostles, such as Saint Peter, John the Apostle, and Jesus&#x27;s brothers James and Jude.

Three of the seven letters are anonymous. These three have traditionally been attributed to John the Apostle, the son of Zebedee and one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Consequently, these letters have been labelled the Johannine epistles, despite the fact that none of the epistles mentions any author. Most modern scholars believe the author is not John the Apostle, but there is no scholarly consensus for any particular historical figure. (see: Authorship of the Johannine works).

Two of the letters claim to have been written or issued by Simon Peter, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Therefore, they have traditionally been called the Petrine epistles. However, most modern scholars agree the second epistle was probably not written by Peter, because it appears to have been written in the early 2nd century, long after Peter had died. Yet, opinions on the first epistle are more divided; many scholars do think this letter is authentic.

In one epistle, the author only calls himself James (Ἰάκωβος &quot;Iákobos&quot;). It is not known which James this is supposed to be. There are several different traditional Christian interpretations of other New Testament texts which mention a James, brother of Jesus. However, most modern scholars tend to reject this line of reasoning, since the author himself does not indicate any familial relationship with Jesus. A similar problem presents itself with the Epistle of Jude (Ἰούδας &quot;Ioudas&quot;): the writer names himself a brother of James (ἀδελφὸς δὲ Ἰακώβου &quot;adelphos de Iakóbou&quot;), but it is not clear which James is meant. According to some Christian traditions, this is the same James as the author of the Epistle of James, who was allegedly a brother of Jesus; and so, this Jude should also be a brother of Jesus, despite the fact he does not indicate any such thing in his text.

===Later pseudepigrapha===
The Gospel of Peter and the attribution to Paul of the &quot;Epistle to the Laodiceans&quot; are both examples of pseudepigrapha that were excluded from the New Testament canon. They are often referred to as New Testament apocrypha. Further examples of New Testament pseudepigrapha include the &quot;Gospel of Barnabas&quot; and the &quot;Gospel of Judas&quot;, which begins by presenting itself as &quot;the secret account of the revelation that Jesus spoke in conversation with Judas Iscariot&quot;.

The Vision of Ezra is an ancient apocryphal text purportedly written by the biblical scribe Ezra. The earliest surviving manuscripts, composed in Latin, date to the 11th century CE, although textual peculiarities strongly suggest that the text was originally written in Greek. Like the Greek Apocalypse of Ezra, the work is clearly Christian, and features several apostles being seen in heaven. However, the text is significantly shorter than the Apocalypse.

The Donation of Constantine is a forged Roman imperial decree by which the 4th-century emperor Constantine the Great supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope. Composed probably in the 8th century, it was used, especially in the 13th century, in support of claims of political authority by the papacy. Lorenzo Valla, an Italian Catholic priest and Renaissance humanist, is credited with first exposing the forgery with solid philological arguments in 1439–1440, although the document&#x27;s authenticity had been repeatedly contested since 1001.

In Russian history, in 1561 Muscovites supposedly received a letter from the Patriarch of Constantinople which asserted the right of Ivan the Terrible to claim the title of Tsar. This, too, turned out to be false. While earlier Russian Monarchs had on some occasions used the title &quot;Tsar&quot;, Ivan the Terrible previously known as &quot;Grand Prince of all the Russias&quot; was the first to be formally crowned as Tsar of All Rus (). This was related to Russia&#x27;s growing ambitions to become an Orthodox &quot;Third Rome&quot;, after the Fall of Constantinople – for which the supposed approval by the Patriarch added weight.

The Anaphorae of Mar Nestorius, employed in the Eastern Churches, is attributed to Nestorius, but its earliest manuscripts are in Syriac, which question its Greek authorship.

===The Zohar===
The &quot;Zohar&quot; (, lit. Splendor or Radiance), foundational work in the literature of Jewish mystical thought known as Kabbalah, first appeared in Spain in the 13th century, and was published by a Jewish writer named Moses de León. De León ascribed the work to Shimon bar Yochai (&quot;Rashbi&quot;), a rabbi of the 2nd century during the Roman persecution who, according to Jewish legend, hid in a cave for thirteen years studying the Torah and was inspired by the Prophet Elijah to write the Zohar. This accords with the traditional claim by adherents that Kabbalah is the concealed part of the Oral Torah. Modern academic analysis of the Zohar, such as that by the 20th century religious historian Gershom Scholem, has theorized that de León was the actual author, as textual analysis points to a Medieval Spanish Jewish writer rather than one living in Roman-ruled Palestine.

===Ovid===
Conrad Celtes, a noted German humanist scholar and poet of the German Renaissance, collected numerous Greek and Latin manuscripts in his function as librarian of the Imperial Library in Vienna. In a 1504 letter to the Venetian publisher Aldus Manutius Celtes claimed to have discovered the missing books of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;. However, it turned out that the purported Ovid verses had actually been composed by an 11th-century monk and were known to the Empire of Nicaea according to William of Rubruck. Even so, many contemporary scholars believed Celtes and continued to write about the existence of the missing books until well into the 17th century.

==As a literary device==
Pseudepigraphy has been employed as a metafictional technique. Authors who have made notable use of this device include James Hogg (&quot;The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot;), Thomas Carlyle (&quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;), Jorge Luis Borges (&quot;An Examination of the Works of Herbert Quain&quot;; &quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote&quot;), Vladimir Nabokov (&quot;Pale Fire&quot;), Stanislaw Lem (&quot;A Perfect Vacuum&quot;; &quot;Imaginary Magnitude&quot;) Roberto Bolaño (&quot;Nazi Literature in the Americas&quot;) and Stefan Heym (&quot;The Lenz Papers&quot;).

Edgar Rice Burroughs also presented many of his works – including the most well-known, the &quot;Tarzan&quot; books – as pseudepigrapha, prefacing each book with a detailed introduction presenting the supposed actual author, with Burroughs himself pretending to be no more than the literary editor. J.R.R. Tolkien in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; presents that story and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as translated from the fictional &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot; written by characters within the novels. The twelve books of &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot; series by George MacDonald Fraser similarly pretend to be transcriptions of the papers left by an &quot;illustrious Victorian soldier&quot;, each volume prefaced by a long semi-scholarly Explanatory Note stating that &quot;additional packets of Flashman&#x27;s papers have been found and are here presented to the public&quot;. A similar device was used by Ian Fleming in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and by various other writers of popular fiction.

<text>East Barnet is an area of north London within the London Borough of Barnet bordered by New Barnet, Cockfosters and Southgate. It is a largely residential suburb whose central area contains shops, public houses, restaurants and services, and the parish church of St Mary the Virgin. East Barnet is close to the M25 and the A1 and M1.

==History==
From 1894 until 1965 East Barnet formed part of the East Barnet Urban District of Hertfordshire. In 1965, it was transferred from Hertfordshire to Greater London; the area was amalgamated with Barnet and Friern Barnet Urban Districts, Finchley and Hendon Municipal Boroughs to form the London Borough of Barnet.

==Governance==
Barnet local elections are held every four years to elect councillors. East Barnet is covered by two wards:
* &quot;East Barnet Ward&quot; – East of the railway line and north of Parkside Gardens / Stuart Road.
* &quot;Brunswick Park Ward&quot; – East of the railway line and south of Parkside Gardens / Stuart Road.

Note: St Mary the Virgin – the Parish Church of East Barnet – is actually in Brunswick Park Ward. Brunswick Park Ward contains the districts of Brunswick Park and Osidge.

<text>Elijah (), Op. 70, MWV A 25, is an oratorio by Felix Mendelssohn depicting events in the life of the Prophet Elijah as told in the books 1 Kings and 2 Kings of the Old Testament. It premiered on 26 August 1846.

==Music and its style==
This piece was composed in the spirit of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Baroque predecessors Bach and Handel, whose music he greatly admired. In 1829 Mendelssohn had organized the first performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; since the composer&#x27;s death and was instrumental in bringing this and other Bach works to widespread popularity. By contrast, Handel&#x27;s oratorios never went out of fashion in England. Mendelssohn prepared a scholarly edition of some of Handel&#x27;s oratorios for publication in London. &quot;Elijah&quot; is modelled on the oratorios of these two Baroque masters; however, in its lyricism and use of orchestral and choral colour the style clearly reflects Mendelssohn&#x27;s own skill as an early Romantic composer.

The work is scored for eight vocal soloists (two each of bass, tenor, alto, soprano), full symphony orchestra including 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, ophicleide, timpani, organ and strings and a large chorus usually singing in four, but occasionally eight parts. The title role was sung at the premiere by the Austrian bass Josef Staudigl.

Mendelssohn had discussed an oratorio based on Elijah in the late 1830s with his friend Karl Klingemann, who had provided him with the libretto for his comic operetta &quot;Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde&quot;, which resulted in a partial text that Klingemann was unable to finish. Mendelssohn then turned to , the librettist for his earlier oratorio &quot;St. Paul&quot;, who quickly abandoned Klingemann&#x27;s work and produced his own text that combined the story of Elijah as told in the Book of Kings with psalms. In 1845, the Birmingham Festival commissioned an oratorio from Mendelssohn, who worked with Schubring to put the text in final form and in 1845 and 1846 composed his oratorio to the German and English texts in parallel, taking care to change musical phrases to suit the rhythms and stresses of the translation by William Bartholomew, a chemist who was also an experienced amateur poet and composer.

The oratorio was first performed on 26 August 1846 at Birmingham Town Hall in its English version, conducted by the composer, and it was immediately acclaimed a classic of the genre. As &quot;The Times&quot; critic wrote: &#x27;Never was there a more complete triumph  – never a more thorough and speedy recognition of a great work of art&#x27;. Notwithstanding the work&#x27;s triumph, Mendelssohn revised his oratorio wholesale before another group of performances in London in April 1847  – one (23 April) in the presence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The German version was first performed on the composer&#x27;s birthday, 3 February 1848, in Leipzig, a few months after Mendelssohn&#x27;s death, under the baton of the composer Niels Gade.

==Biblical narrative==

Mendelssohn uses biblical episodes relating to Elijah, which in the original, and , are narrated in rather laconic form, to produce intensely dramatic scenes, while adding several related biblical texts, mostly taken from the Old Testament. These were doubtless well fitted to the taste of Mendelssohn&#x27;s time, and a Victorian sentimentality also seems detectable in places.

Among the episodes is the resurrection of a dead youth. A dramatic episode is the contest of the gods, in which Jehovah consumes an offered sacrifice in a column of fire, while a sequence of increasingly frantic prayers by the prophets of the god Baal failed. Part I is concluded by the bringing of rain to parched Israel through Elijah&#x27;s prayers. Part II depicts the persecution of Elijah by Queen Jezebel, his retirement to the desert, his vision of God appearing, his return to his work, and his ascension on a fiery chariot into heaven. The work ends with prophecies and praise.

== Structure ==
The work in two parts opens with a declamation by Elijah, after which the overture is played. The sections are listed in the following table, with the text in both German and English, a biblical source for the passage (the dramatic action highlighted by a background colour), and the voices. The choir is mostly four-part SATB, but up to eight parts. The soloists are Elijah (baritone); soprano (S), singing the Widow, the Youth (sometimes taken by a boy treble) and Angel II; alto (A), singing Angel I and the Queen; and tenor (T), singing the parts of Obadiah and Ahab. The work is often performed with four soloists.

Some movements are simple oratorio forms such as recitative and aria, others explore hybrid combinations, such as recitative with choir, for dramatic effect. The fugal overture leads attacca to the first choral movement. The choir acts as the people (&quot;Das Volk&quot;), but also comments, like the choir in Greek drama. The narrative passages from the books of Kings are highlighted by green background.



==Reception==
&quot;Elijah&quot; was popular at its premiere and has been frequently performed, particularly in English-speaking countries, ever since. It is a particular favourite of amateur choral societies. Its melodrama, easy appeal and stirring choruses have provided the basis for countless successful performances. Prince Albert inscribed a libretto for the oratorio &quot;Elijah&quot; in 1847: &quot;To the noble artist who, surrounded by the Baal-worship of false art, has been able, like a second Elijah, through genius and study, to remain true to the service of true art.&quot; A number of critics later treated the work harshly, however, emphasizing its conventional outlook and undaring musical style. Bernard Shaw wrote in 1892:
:I sat out the performance on Wednesday to the last note, an act of professional devotion which was no part of my plan for the evening ... You have only to think of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, of the Ninth Symphony, of &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, of the inspired moments of Bach and Handel, to see the great gulf that lies between the true religious sentiment and our delight in Mendelssohn&#x27;s exquisite prettiness. 

Similarly, after Boston&#x27;s Handel and Haydn Society presented the work for the first time in February 1848, its success resulted in eight more performances that spring. In the mid-1920s, however, H.T. Parker, the city&#x27;s principal music critic, described how members of the audience gazed upward at a recent performance: &quot;How many of those eyes were there in rapture, or were counting the four dead lights in the central sunburst of the ceiling?... &quot;Elijah&quot; is hopelessly, awfully, irremediably mid-Victorian.

However, with the widespread re-evaluation of Mendelssohn’s work in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, these critical opinions have largely changed. In his definitive biography of the composer, the musicologist R. Larry Todd wrote that “the oratorio was the crowning achievement of Felix’s career”. And in 2005 critic and musicologist Michael Steinberg described &quot;Elijah&quot; as “thrilling to sing” and noted that it “includes some of Mendelssohn’s finest music”.

Mendelssohn wrote the soprano part in &quot;Elijah&quot; for the &#x27;Swedish Nightingale&#x27;, Jenny Lind, although she was unavailable to sing the Birmingham premiere. In her place, the part was created by Maria Caterina Rosalbina Caradori-Allan. Lind was devastated by the composer&#x27;s premature death in 1847. She did not feel able to sing the part for a year afterwards. She resumed singing the piece at Exeter Hall in London in late 1848, raising £1,000 to fund a scholarship in his name. After Arthur Sullivan became the first recipient of the Mendelssohn Scholarship, she encouraged him in his career.

Charles Salaman adapted &quot;He that Shall Endure to the End&quot; from &quot;Elijah&quot; as a setting for Psalm 93 (Adonai Malakh), sung on most Friday nights at the sabbath-eve service of the London Spanish &amp; Portuguese Jewish community.

He was awarded the NASA Ames Honor Award for Scientists in 1989, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Outstanding Technical paper Award for Applied Aerodynamics in 1992, and the NASA/Space Club G. M. Low Memorial Engineering Fellowship in 1993.

== Career ==
Robinson started work for NASA in 1975 as a student intern at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. After graduation from the University of California at Davis, he joined NASA Ames in 1979 as a research scientist in the fields of fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, experimental instrumentation, and computational scientific visualization. While at Ames, Robinson earned masters and doctorate degrees in mechanical engineering at Stanford University, with research emphasis in turbulence physics, and additional research in human eye dynamics. In 1990, Robinson was selected as Chief of the Experimental Flow Physics Branch at NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where he led a group of 35 engineers and scientists engaged in aerodynamics and fluid physics research.

In 1993, Robinson was awarded the NASA/Space Club Low Memorial Engineering Fellowship, and was assigned for 15 months to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as Visiting Engineer in the Man Vehicle Laboratory (MVL). As an MVL team-member, he conducted neurovestibular research on astronauts on the Spacelab Life Sciences 2 Shuttle mission (STS-58). Other MIT research included EVA dynamics for satellite capture and space construction. While in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Robinson was also a visiting scientist at the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, doing research on environmental modeling for flight simulation, cockpit human factors for GPS-guided instrument approach procedures, and moving-map displays.

Robinson returned to NASA Langley in September 1994, where he accepted a dual assignment as research scientist in the Multidisciplinary design optimization Branch, and as leader of the Aerodynamics and Acoustics element of NASA&#x27;s General Aviation Technology program.

Robinson has logged over 1,400 hours in aircraft ranging from antique taildraggers to NASA jets.

Robinson began applying to become an astronaut in 1983, and was selected to join NASA Astronaut Corps in 1995. He has flown on four Space Shuttle missions: STS-85, STS-95, STS-114 and STS-130. Robinson served as backup flight engineer for the International Space Station Expedition 4.

On August 3, 2005, as a Mission Specialist (and Flight Engineer) on STS-114, the first Return to Flight mission following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, Robinson became the first human to perform an in-flight repair to the Shuttle&#x27;s exterior. Robinson was sent to remove two protruding gap fillers on &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s heat shield, after engineers determined they might pose a danger upon re-entry. Robinson successfully removed the loose material while the &quot;Discovery&quot; was docked to the International Space Station. Robinson performed another &quot;first&quot; on STS-114 when he made the first podcast from space (transcript &amp; audio) on August 7, 2005. His self-portrait took during the repair was considered one of the early space selfies.

Robinson served as a mission specialist and flight engineer on STS-130, which launched on February 8, 2010, and rendezvoused with the International Space Station on February 10. As Intravehicular Officer, he choreographed the three EVAs involved with the installation and activation of the Node 3 module and Cupola.

Robinson also served as CAPCOM for various Space Shuttle missions.

He retired from the Astronaut Corps in July 2012 to take a teaching position as a full-time professor in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at University of California at Davis. &quot;Steve will be sorely missed by the Astronaut Office,&quot; said Janet Kavandi, Director of Flight Crew Operations. &quot;He was a fellow classmate, and I will personally miss his ever-positive attitude and smiling face. We wish him the best in his future endeavors, and we are confident that he will be a positive influence and wonderful mentor to inquisitive minds at the University of California at Davis.&quot;

Robinson currently directs the UC Davis Center for Human/Robotics/Vehicle Integration and Performance (HRVIP).

== Personal life ==
He enjoys flying, antique aircraft, swimming, canoeing, hiking, music, art, and stereo photography. He plays lead guitar in Max Q, a rock and roll band. His Canadian parents, William, a land surveyor, and Joyce Robinson, resided in Moraga, California.

<text>This is a list of [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s of the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom.

==Key==
==&quot;Humber&quot;-class==
The &quot;Humber&quot;-class monitors were three river monitors under construction for the Brazilian Navy in Britain in 1913, all three were taken over by the Royal Navy shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and were commissioned as small monitors, seeing extensive service during the war.


==&quot;Abercrombie&quot;-class==
The &quot;Abercrombie&quot;-class monitors came about when Bethlehem Steel in the United States, the contracted supplier of the main armament for the Greek battleship being built in Germany, instead offered to sell the four 14&quot;/45 caliber gun twin gun turrets to the Royal Navy on 3 November 1914, the ships were laid down and launched within six months, seeing service throughout the war.


==&quot;Lord Clive&quot;-class==
The Lord Clive&quot;-class monitors, sometimes referred to as the General Wolfe&quot;-class, were built to meet the need for more shore bombardment ships, using twin gun turrets taken from decommissioned &quot;Majestic&quot;-class pre-dreadnought battleships. Three of the ships, HMS &quot;General Wolfe&quot;, &quot;Lord Clive&quot; and &quot;Prince Eugene&quot;, were converted to take the BL 18 inch Mk I naval gun that had originally been allocated to .


==&quot;Marshal Ney&quot;-class==
The &quot;Marshal Ney&quot;-class monitors were built to use the two modern 15-inch turrets made available by the redesign of and as battlecruisers.


==&quot;Gorgon&quot;-class==
The &quot;Gorgon&quot;-class monitors were originally built as coastal defence ships for the Royal Norwegian Navy, but requisitioned for British use.


==&quot;M15&quot;-class==
The &quot;M15&quot;-class monitors were fourteen ships ordered in March 1915, as part of the War Emergency Programme of ship construction, mounting 9.2 inch Mk VI gun turrets removed from the and the Mk X turrets held in stock for the and s.


==&quot;M29&quot;-class==
The &quot;M29&quot;-class monitors were five ships ordered in March 1915, as part of the War Emergency Programme of ship construction.


==&quot;Erebus&quot;-class==
The &quot;Erebus&quot;-class monitors were two ships mounting a single twin BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun turret. They saw active service in World War I off the Belgian coast, were placed in reserve between the wars then served in World War II, with &quot;Terror&quot; being lost in 1941 and &quot;Erebus&quot; surviving to be scrapped in 1946.


==&quot;Roberts&quot;-class==
The &quot;Roberts&quot;-class monitors were two ships mounting a single twin BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun turret built during the Second World War, featuring shallow draught for operating inshore, broad beam to give stability and a high observation platform to observe fall of shot.

<doc id="503237" wikidata="Q1130063" url="?curid=503237" title="Snorks">
<text>Snorks is an animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and SEPP International S.A. in collaboration with 3M France and ran for a total of 4 seasons, consisting of a pilot episode and 65 episodes (108 segments), on NBC from September 15, 1984, to March 15, 1989. The program continued to be available in syndication from 1987 to 1989 as part of &quot;The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera&quot;&#x27;s third season.

==Origins==

===Early years (1977–1981)===
In 1977, Freddy Monnickendam, a Belgian businessman and artist, first made contact with the comics industry when he negotiated the rights for the Smurfs comics to Father Abraham. He later became the head of SEPP, a branch of Dupuis, as an editor responsible for the merchandising of the Smurfs&#x27; comic series. Then he negotiated the contract between Peyo, NBC and Hanna-Barbera for the creation of a new &quot;Smurfs&quot; cartoon series; Peyo wanted the show to be as faithful as possible to his original comics, but Monnickendam wanted it to be more mainstream and accessible. These negotiations would later result in a legal dispute between the two men due to the division of the rights and the money involved. As a final result, Monnickendam decided to compete with the Smurfs&#x27; success, starting a new series of cartoons.

===Development, concept and first comic book (1981–1984)===
In June 1981, Nic Broca created the earlier character designs that were made for &quot;Diskies&quot;, a very early iteration, made for the comic series &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;. Soon, the debut &quot;Snorks&quot; comic book was published in January 1982 by Broca himself. Freddy Monnickendam, after battling with fellow Belgian cartoonist Peyo in court, searched for a series that could rival the success of &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, as he tried and failed to buy its rights since 1977. He acquired the Snorks&#x27; rights from Nic Broca, and both started a partnership with Hanna-Barbera for the production of this new cartoon series. After that, a three-minute Snorks pilot episode was then made for NBC, although it has not been seen by the public.

===Premiere as cartoon series (1984–1989)===
&quot;Snorks&quot; premiered on September 15, 1984, and ended on May 13, 1989. It aired for five years. Unlike Freddy Monnickendam had hoped, he was not able to take the Snorks&#x27; success to the same heights as &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, which resulted on the end of his partnership with Broca, and finally, the disbanding of SEPP. Although the Snorks&#x27; success was limited, the cartoon show gained fans worldwide, making appearances in popular culture and gaining various product lines.

==Synopsis==
The Snorks are a race of small, colorful anthropomorphic sea creatures that live in the undersea world of Snorkland. They have snorkels on their heads, which are used to propel them swiftly through the water.

<text>Jennifer Patricia Morris (born 29 September 1956) is a New Zealand-Australian singer-songwriter. Her first success came with New Zealand band the Crocodiles, who had a top 20 hit single with &quot;Tears&quot;. Re-locating to Sydney in February 1981, she was a backing vocalist for various groups and formed a trio, QED, in 1983.

Morris provided backing vocals for INXS on their 1984 album, &quot;The Swing&quot;. She then recorded a duet with lead singer, Michael Hutchence, on a cover of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s hit &quot;Jackson&quot;; it was included as a bonus track on the March 1985 (cassette only) INXS EP, &quot;Dekadance&quot;, which reached number two on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Morris worked on their 1985–1986 Listen Like Thieves World Tour.

Her solo career includes top five Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) albums with &quot;Shiver&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Honeychild&quot; in 1991, and her top five ARIA singles are &quot;She Has to Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Break in the Weather&quot;. These albums and singles also peaked in the top ten on the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) charts.

Morris has won two ARIA Music Awards for &#x27;Best Female Artist&#x27; in 1987 and 1988 and was nominated for the same award in 1992. In 2003, on Australia Day (26 January), Morris became an Australian citizen and in 2010 she received the Medal of the Order of Australia.

==Life and music career==
===Early years and the Crocodiles===

Jenny Morris was born in Tokoroa, New Zealand, and grew up in Hamilton with three brothers (Alistair, Rhys and Tam) and four sisters (Maxine, Bronte, Joanne and Shanley). Morris wrote a poem on the Vietnam War when she was 12 and used her sister&#x27;s guitar to put it to music. Morris has stated that her influences include Aretha Franklin and Dusty Springfield. Her first professional performance was at age fifteen, at Andersons Theatre Restaurant, in Hamilton. In 1976 she became a singer with How&#x27;s Your Father, who were finalists in the &#x27;National Battle of the Bands&#x27;. She began working as a Home Economics teacher for two years at a high school near Wellington. Late in 1978, Morris joined an all-girl group, Wide Mouthed Frogs in Wellington, performing lead vocals. Fellow members were Kate Brockie on lead vocals, Andrea Gilkison on guitar, Tina Matthews on bass guitar, Bronwyn Murray on keyboards and Sally Zwartz on drums. In 1979 they released the track, &quot;Some Day&quot; for the compilation album, &quot;Home Grown Volume One&quot;; &quot;Some Day&quot; was cowritten with Tony Backhouse, guitarist of fellow Wellington band the Spats, which also had a track, &quot;Young Ladies in Hot Cars&quot;, on the compilation.

Wide Mouthed Frogs worked with the Spats&#x27; members: drummer Bruno Lawrence sometimes played saxophone for them and keyboardist Peter Dasent became their musical director. By 1980, the Spats had evolved into the Crocodiles, under the mentorship of US producer Kim Fowley, and featured Backhouse, Dasent, Fane Flaws (guitar, vocals), Mark Hornibrook (bass guitar), Lawrence, and songwriter Arthur Baysting. Morris was asked to join and soon after, Hornibrook departed and was replaced by Matthews. The Crocodiles were managed by Mike Chunn (ex-Split Enz bassist) and regularly performed in Auckland. In January 1980, they played the high-profile Sweetwaters Music Festival and in April that year, they released their debut album, &quot;Tears&quot;, produced by Glyn Tucker, and its lead single, &quot;Tears&quot;, both reached number  17 on the respective New Zealand albums and singles charts.

Lawrence left and was replaced on drums by Ian Gilroy (ex-Whizz Kids), then Flaws left, although he continued to write material for the second album. Released in November 1980, &quot;Looking at Ourselves&quot;, was produced by Ian Morris. That year, they won &#x27;Best Group&#x27; and &#x27;Most Promising Group&#x27; at the New Zealand Music Awards. The line-up went through further changes, Gilroy left to join the Swingers, then Matthews and Dasent left. In February 1981, following a repeat performance at the Sweetwaters Festival, The Crocodiles moved to Sydney, at the behest of their manager, Chunn, with new band members, Barton Price (drums), Rick &#x27;Rikki&#x27; Morris (guitar) and Jonathan Zwartz (bass) only to disband in July. Price went on to join Models. Morris explained why The Crocodiles left:

===QED and &quot;Jackson&quot;===

Morris began her solo career with the single, &quot;Puberty Blues&quot; in December 1981 on Mushroom Records; it was the title track from the 1981 film &quot;Puberty Blues&quot;, which was a local box-office success. The song was written by Tim Finn and performed by Sharon O&#x27;Neill in the film. The B-side was &quot;Adolescent Angst&quot;, which Morris recorded with The Morris Majors. &quot;Puberty Blues&quot; reached the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart top 100. The follow-up single, &quot;Little By Little&quot;—a cover of The Springfields 1960&#x27;s song—was released in 1982 but failed to chart.

During 1982–1984, Morris continued as a session backing vocalist, contributing to releases by ex-manager Chunn&#x27;s brother Geoff (also ex-Split Enz); ex-bandmate Flaws&#x27; project and album, &quot;I Am Joe&#x27;s Music&quot;; the 1983 Models&#x27; album &quot;The Pleasure of Your Company&quot;; and New Zealand outfit D.D. Smash&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;The Optimist&quot;, she went on to tour with D.D. Smash front man Dave Dobbyn, and the New Zealand version of The Party Boys. Morris was credited for Dropbears&#x27; 1984 mini-LP, &quot;Untitled&quot;, before contributing backing vocals to INXS&#x27; first number 1 album &quot;The Swing&quot;.

In late 1983, Morris formed QED in Sydney with guitarist Rex Goh (ex-Air Supply) and bassist Ian Belton (ex-Dave Dobbyn, Renée Geyer). The trio signed with EMI Australia and their recordings were produced by Mark Moffatt (The Saints, Mondo Rock, Tim Finn) and Ricky Fataar (Geyer, Finn, Kids in the Kitchen). Morris was now managed by Chris Murphy, who also handled INXS. QED recorded their versions of The Crocodiles&#x27; material including, &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot;, &quot;Animal Magic&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re So Hip&quot;; Morris also co-wrote new songs with Goh. QED&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot;, was released in December, and performed on national television pop music show, &quot;Countdown&quot;, on 1 April 1984; it peaked at number 19 on the national chart. The follow-up single &quot;Solo and More&quot; was issued in March, but failed to chart. The third single, &quot;This One&quot;, appeared in August and reached top 50. Additional musicians for QED&#x27;s first album, &quot;Animal Magic&quot;, included keyboardist Amanda Vincent (Eurogliders, later joined the Jenny Morris band), drummer Steve Fearnly, saxophonist Tony Buchanan, and Fataar on drums. EMI released it in November, but sales remained low and the album did not chart. QED only released one album and disbanded by 1985, Morris continued session and touring work with other artists, Belton went on to Mondo Rock, and Goh to Eurogliders.

Morris recorded a duet with INXS lead singer, Michael Hutchence, on a cover of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s hit &quot;Jackson&quot;, it was included as a bonus track on the April 1984 (cassette only) INXS EP, &quot;Dekadance&quot;, which reached number two on the charts. Morris and INXS performed &quot;Jackson&quot; live at the 1984 &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards held on 19 May 1985. At Murphy&#x27;s suggestion she teamed with INXS as a backing singer on their 1985 Australian tour—originally just for a few weeks—and stayed on for eighteen months on their 1985–1986 Listen Like Thieves World Tour. Morris recorded and, in November 1985, released her first single for Warner Entertainment Australia (WEA), &quot;Get Some Humour&quot;, with a contribution from Dave Dobbyn, which reached the top 100.

===Solo success: 1986–1994===
During the US leg of the Listen Like Thieves World Tour, in January 1986, Morris recorded &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get Hurt&quot;, which was written and produced by INXS songwriter and keyboardist, Andrew Farriss. Recorded with backing from INXS&#x27; Andrew and Jon Farriss and Garry Gary Beers, together with guitarist Ian Moss (ex-Cold Chisel), it was released in September and peaked at number 24. The next single &quot;Body and Soul&quot;—composed by Morris—reached number 55 in mid-1987.

In 1986 she performed on The Rock Party&#x27;s &quot;Everything to Live For&quot;, a charity project initiated by The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), which included many Australasian musicians such as Big Pig&#x27;s Sherine Abeyratne; Crowded House&#x27;s Neil Finn, Tim Finn, Paul Hester, Eddie Rayner and Nick Seymour; Dynamic Hepnotics&#x27; Robert Susz; GANGgajang&#x27;s Mark Callaghan, Robbie James and Geoff Stapleton; Paul Kelly &amp; the Coloured Girls&#x27; Michael Barclay and Paul Kelly; Mental As Anything&#x27;s Reg Mombassa and Martin Plaza; Models&#x27; Sean Kelly; The Promise&#x27;s Greg Herbert; Rockmelons&#x27; Mary Azzopardi, Peter Blakeley and Danny De Costa; The Venetians&#x27; Rick Swinn; Vitabeats&#x27; Andrew Barnum and Lissa Barnum; and Deborah Conway, Spencer P. Jones, and John Kennedy.

In July 1987, Morris released her first solo album, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, produced by Moffatt and Fataar and mixed by Tim Kramer. It sold over 70,000 copies in Australia (platinum status) reaching number 13 on the album charts in Australia and number 21 in New Zealand. The album spawned two further hits in &quot;You I Know&quot;—written by Neil Finn—which reached number 13 in Australia and number 30 in New Zealand, and &quot;Lighthearted&quot; peaked in the top 100 in both countries. Morris also hit the road with her backing band, including Vincent, Jehan Lindsay (ex-Richard Clapton Band), Paul Burton (ex-Mark Williams Band), and Roger Mason (ex-Models). Morris won back-to-back ARIA Awards for &#x27;Best Female Artist&#x27; in 1987 and 1988. In 1988, Morris and photographer, Paul Clarke, were married.

Her next single &quot;Saved Me&quot; was released in July 1989 and reached the top 40 in Australia and New Zealand. It featured a distinctly Latin-Spanish feel permeated by funk undertones, with the promo video shot in Nicaragua by Richard Lowenstein. Morris&#x27; second solo album &quot;Shiver&quot;, followed in August and was produced by Farriss, with Morris writing ten of the eleven tracks. In between recording the album, she gave birth to her son, Hugh. The second single was &quot;She Has to Be Loved&quot;, a song which melded funk rhythms with a pop hook. In addition, it featured a strong feminist theme, and quickly became a favourite among Morris&#x27;s female fans. &quot;She Has to Be Loved&quot; became Morris&#x27; first Australasian top ten hit reaching number five in Australia and number three in New Zealand during October 1989. &quot;Shiver&quot; continued to chart over the Southern Hemisphere summer of 1989–1990, peaking at number five on the Australian album charts and number six in New Zealand, it established Morris as one of the best selling female artists in Australia. The track &quot;Aotearoa&quot;—Māori term for &#x27;Land of the Long White Cloud&#x27; or New Zealand—received a special single release in New Zealand and reached top 40. The album eventually sold over 250,000 copies, achieving double platinum status in Australia. It spawned two more singles; &quot;Street of Love&quot; written by Australian songsmith Paul Kelly, which reached the top 100 in Australia; and the reggae inspired &quot;Self Deceiver&quot;, penned by Morris and Kelly, which reached top 100 in Australia.

As one of Australia&#x27;s leading female singer-songwriters, Morris toured extensively locally and internationally, first by backing Tears for Fears on the European leg of their 1989 Sowing the Seeds of Love Tour, then on Prince&#x27;s 1990 Nude Tour in Denmark, Germany and France,—with Dweezil Zappa as her lead guitarist—and again with INXS on their X-Factor tour.

In 1990 she released a cover of &quot;Piece of my Heart&quot;—popularised by Janis Joplin—which peaked in the Australian top 40 in early 1991. She recorded her third album, &quot;Honeychild&quot;, with producers Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Killing Joke) and Mark Forrester. The first single from the album, &quot;Break in the Weather&quot;, was co-written by Morris and her youngest brother Tam, appeared in September 1991, it reached number two in Australia and number five in New Zealand. &quot;Honeychild&quot; was released in October and became her second consecutive top ten album, peaking at number five in Australia and New Zealand. Her session musicians, included Wendy Matthews and Midnight Oil&#x27;s Jim Moginie. &quot;Honeychild&quot; spawned three more singles; &quot;I&#x27;ve Had You&quot;, another Morris and Kelly collaboration, which reached top 50 in Australia and New Zealand; the funk laden &quot;Zero&quot;, featuring the rhythm section of drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare, which peaked top 100 in Australia and top 40 in New Zealand; and &quot;Crackerjack Man&quot;, which failed to reach the top 100 ARIA chart in Australia.

On 28 March 1992 Morris performed at the Concert for Life at Centennial Park in Sydney—a fund raiser for the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Centre—with Crowded House, Def FX, Diesel, INXS, Ratcat and Yothu Yindi. Due to inclement weather an expected attendance of 100,000 never eventuated and, with the event only raising $500,000, scandal was expressed in the media over funding distribution.

In November, &quot;The Best of Jenny Morris: The Story So Far&quot;, a best-of compilation was released, it included &quot;Jackson&quot; which was performed as a duet with Michael Hutchence and INXS on a 1985 &quot;Countdown&quot; episode, and a re-recorded version of an old The Crocodiles&#x27; hit &quot;Tears&quot;. The album sold steadily and peaked at number four in New Zealand and number 12 on the Australian charts during May 1993, after Morris had supported Paul McCartney on the Australian leg of his The New World Tour. 1994 saw the birth of her daughter, Bella. Morris&#x27; next single, &quot;The Price I Pay&quot;, a Billy Bragg cover, was her last appearance on the Australian ARIA top 100 singles chart.

===Later years: 1995–current===

Morris&#x27; next four singles &quot;Only We Can Hear&quot;, &quot;Rhythm and Flow&quot;, &quot;In Too Deep&quot;, and &quot;What Do I Do Now&quot;, were released over eighteen months, from mid-1994 to early 1996. &quot;Salvation Jane&quot; was released in July 1995, nearly four years after her last album, and featured some of her strongest vocal work, including the languid &quot;Rhythm and Flow,&quot; with its Aboriginal influences. Issued on the rooArt label, it was produced by Andrew Farriss and Moffatt, together with Electric Hippies&#x27; duo Steve Balbi and Justin Stanley. The album featured songs from a song writing retreat held at Miles Copeland&#x27;s castle in Bordeaux, France. Here, Morris co-wrote a number of songs with other international songwriters. Also in 1995, Morris became a non-executive writer director on the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Board and as of 2009 is still on the Board. Morris made an appearance in the television drama, &quot;Water Rats&quot;, in 1997 she continued her gigs, worked for environmental causes and maintained her family life.

In October 2000 she performed with Vika and Linda Bull and Jodi Phillis, at a sold-out Carole King tribute show, &quot;Tapestry&quot;: the songs of Carole King, held at the Sydney Opera House; it then toured the other Australian capital cities in August–September 2001. In August 2002, Morris&#x27; released her next album, &quot;Hit &amp; Myth&quot;, co-produced by Nick Wales (Coda), was released on 8 May 2002 by Yep! Records. The album features classical musicians (Renaissance Players, Winsome Evans), pop musicians (Davey Lane, Jodi Phillis (ex Clouds)) and jazz (PROP) musicians.

Morris wrote or co-wrote nine of the eleven songs on the album, the others, &quot;Guiding Star&quot;, was written by Neil Finn and &quot;The Blacksmith&quot; is a traditional folk song—the first one she learnt on guitar. Neither the album nor the singles &quot;Home&quot;, released 29 October 2001, and &quot;Downtime&quot;, released 15 July 2002, managed to chart. The music video for &quot;Downtime&quot; featured a number of well-known Australian actors, including Hugo Weaving, Bryan Brown, Matt Newton and Peter Fenton, miming the words to the song. Also in 2002, a portrait of Morris by artist Jan Williamson was entered in the Archibald Prize. The portrait did not win the main prize, but won both the popular awards, the &quot;Packing Room Prize&quot; and &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice Award&quot;. In February, Morris appeared on the SBS TV documentary, &quot;Mum&#x27;s the Word&quot;, where high-profile women talked about being a working mother. She sang, &quot;Little Little&quot; an ode to her (then) unborn child written for her 1989 album, &quot;Shiver&quot;. In October Morris appeared in &quot;Finding Joy&quot;, a low budget independent Australian feature film, in a cameo role (Tracey). She sings part of a song called &quot;Educated Kind of Thing&quot;. In November 2002 she performed at the Candlelight AIDS Memorial, in Darlinghurst, marking the beginning of AIDS awareness week.

In March 2003, Port Fairy&#x27;s 27th Annual Folk Festival was staged with Archie Roach, John Williamson, Renée Geyer, Morris and emerging Australian band The Waifs were among the popular performers. In October she joined the board of Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Australia, and is an active member of their Fundraising Committee.

In April 2004, &quot;&quot; a repackaging of her 1992 compilation, &quot;The Story So Far&quot;, was issued with new artwork and a bonus track, &quot;Little Little&quot;, an ode to her then unborn baby. In May 2005, the &quot;Alive&quot; DVD was released, it was recorded in Sydney at The Basement and features Morris playing her hits with her band: Steve Balbi (Noiseworks); Paul Searles (Skunkhour); James Hasselwood (The Dissociatives); Jared Underwood (Coda) and actor Josh Quong Tart, with special guest appearances from Ian Moss, Andrew Farriss and Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst. The DVD was released with a bonus CD.

&quot;Clear Blue in Stormy Skies&quot;, her next album, was released by Liberation Music in June 2006 and includes a dozen remodelled versions of her radio hits of the 1980s and 1990s, together with some new material, a cover of the INXS song, &quot;This Time&quot;, in tribute to Michael Hutchence, and a new song, &quot;The Time&quot;.

In September 2009, Morris toured Afghanistan to Tarin Kowt and Kandahar and played for occupying troops. In October, she appeared on the SBS TV quiz show, &quot;RocKwiz&quot;, which included a performance of the Crowded House classic, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Natural&quot;, with Don McGlashan. She performed at the closing ceremony of the 2009 World Masters Games in Sydney, together with Dragon and The Choirboys.

In January 2010, Morris received the Order of Australia with a citation, &quot;for service to the arts, particularly music, and to the community through charitable organisations&quot;. Morris was glad that her charity, Nordoff-Robbins was recognised. Morris appeared at the 2010 New Zealand International Arts Festival in Wellington on 13 March.

On 22 February 2016, The Australian Taxation Office initiated insolvency proceedings for her company Aymsolo Pty Ltd (aka Jenny Morris Band.)

In May 2017, Morris was the recipient of the Excellence in the Community award in recognition of her achievements behind the microphone and as a fundraiser for charities such as Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Australia and Support Act. The ceremony took place in Sydney with a number of guests&#x27;; including Neil Finn, Mark Lizotte and Jimmy Barnes performing Morris&#x27; songs.

In the 2019 New Year Honours, Morris was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to music and charity fundraising.

In May 2021, Morris was cast in the upcoming superhero film &quot;&quot;, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in an undisclosed role.

<text>The Red Line is a light rail line in Dallas, Texas operated by the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system. It began operations in June 1996, and is one of two inaugural light rail lines in the DART light rail system alongside the .

==Route==
===Westmoreland to Downtown===
The southwestern terminus of the Red Line is at Westmoreland Station in southwest Dallas at the intersection of Illinois Avenue and Westmoreland Road. The southwestern part of the Red Line runs on a private right-of-way with grade crossings. Just before 8th &amp; Corinth, the line merges with the . The joint Red and Blue Line tracks then rise on to a viaduct that crosses Cedar Creek, the Trinity River, and a freight railroad line. At Lamar Street, the line turns north at a wye where a pair of tracks leading to one of two train yards on the system diverges. The Red and Blue Lines continue north, crossing the Landry Freeway, travelling under the Dallas Convention Center and stop at Dallas Union Station. After crossing over Main Street, the lines turn east as they merge with the and and enter downtown Dallas. At this point, the lines leave their right of ways and operate on a dedicated street-running right of way.

===Downtown to Parker Road===
The four DART lines share a common section of track through downtown, with four stops: West End, Akard Street, St. Paul Street and Pearl Street.

After Pearl Street, street running ends and the lines return to private right-of-ways. The four lines diverge at a wye, with the Green Line diverging to the southeast while the Red, Blue and Orange Lines turn north, cross the Good-Latimer Expressway at grade, and descend into a long tunnel under the Central Expressway (US 75), with a stop at Cityplace. The lines exit the tunnel at Mockingbird. The Blue Line diverges from the Red Line and heads east, while the Red and Orange Lines turn north.

The Red Line then travels through north Dallas, Richardson and Plano. Most of the line runs at grade level with grade crossings, although portions of the route run on elevated viaducts. The line terminates at the Parker Road Station at Park Boulevard near Central Expressway in Collin County.

==History==
Much of the line was constructed on the former Texas Electric Railway route. That service ceased operations in 1948.

The Red Line was part of the initial launch of DART&#x27;s light rail testing and service in 1996. At the time, the line only ran from Westmoreland Station to Pearl Station in the northeast corner of downtown. In 1997, the Red Line was extended to Park Lane Station, and was the first DART line to use the 3.5-mile twin tunnels. On December 18, 2000, Cityplace Station, the southwest&#x27;s first commercial subway station was opened along the Red Line underneath Cityplace Tower in the tunnel under the Central Expressway.

In 2002, the Red Line extended into Richardson, ending at Galatyn Park Station, extending the light rail service over its original length. Later that year, the line was opened to the Parker Road Station, an additional of track, its current terminus.

==Plans for expansion==

The current northern terminus of the Red Line is Parker Road station in Plano. The further north suburb, Allen, is eligible to join DART. However, active Red line service is unable to expand further north because Allen is currently unable to levy the 1% sales tax required for DART membership.

The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) in a 2022 meeting discussed the possibility of expansion of the Red Line corridor from Plano through Allen to McKinney. Either the Red Line or the Silver Line could be extended north. The study proposed seven stations between the current Parker Road Station and the hypothetical northern terminus Downtown McKinney Station. The extension would be 18 miles long, cost between $700 million and $900 million to construct, and is estimated to have 7,000 to 8,000 riders a day by 2045.

<doc id="503246" wikidata="Q1780962" url="?curid=503246" title="Groupset">
<text>A groupset or gruppo (from the Italian for &quot;group&quot;, sometimes misspelled grouppo) is a bicycle component manufacturer&#x27;s organized collection of mechanical parts. It generally refers to all of the components that make up a bicycle excluding the bicycle frame, fork, stem, wheels, tires, and rider contact points, such as the saddle and handlebars.

These parts typically include the following:
* 2 gear levers or shifters &quot;and&quot;
* 2 brake levers &quot;or&quot;
* 2 integrated brake levers/shifters
* 2 brakes, front and rear
* 2 derailleurs, front and rear
* 1 bottom bracket
* 1 crankset
* 1 chain
* 1 cogset, freewheel or cassette
With the following forming part of some groupsets:
* 1 headset (more commonly included with vintage groupsets)
* 1 seatpost
* 2 hubs, front and rear (although, most manufacturers now offer groupset-branded pre-built wheels)
* Pair of pedals
* assorted cables and cable housing

Except for special commemorative versions, manufacturers do not actually package the various components together to be sold by retailers as a complete groupset. Therefore when a modern road groupset is bought after-market (as an upgrade for an older bike, or for someone building their own bike), the customer can choose which parts they require, the price of the groupset is just the individual prices of the chosen parts added together.

The major groupset manufacturers are Campagnolo for road bicycles and Shimano and SRAM for both road and mountain bikes.

Manufacturers typically offer a range of several groupsets, each targeted at a different budget or use. For instance, Dura-Ace, Super Record and Red are the top-of-the-line road racing groupsets for Shimano, Campagnolo and SRAM respectively while Claris, Veloce and Apex are their entry level road racing group sets, respectively.

<doc id="503249" wikidata="Q208643" url="?curid=503249" title="Malay Archipelago">
<text>The Malay Archipelago is the archipelago between Mainland Southeast Asia and Australia, and is also called Insulindia or the Indo-Australian Archipelago. The name was taken from the 19th-century European concept of a Malay race, later based on the distribution of Austronesian languages. It has also been called the &quot;Malay world,&quot; &quot;Nusantara&quot;, &quot;East Indies&quot; over time. The name is controversial in Indonesia due to its ethnic connotations and colonial undertones, which can overshadow the country&#x27;s diverse cultures.

Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, the archipelago of over 25,000 islands and islets is the largest archipelago by area and fifth by number of islands in the world. It includes Brunei, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia (specifically East Malaysia), Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. The term is largely synonymous with Maritime Southeast Asia.

== Etymology and terminology ==

=== Malay archipelago ===
The term &quot;Malay Archipelago&quot; was derived from the European concept of a &quot;Malay race&quot; (a culturally-similar non-Oceanian subset of the Austronesian peoples), an outdated racial concept proposed by European explorers.
The 19th-century naturalist Alfred Wallace used the term &quot;Malay Archipelago&quot; as the title of his influential book documenting his studies in the region. Wallace also referred to the area as the &quot;Indian Archipelago&quot; and the &quot;Indo-Australian Archipelago&quot;. He included the Solomon Islands and Malay Peninsula in the region due to physiographic similarities. As Wallace noted, there are arguments for excluding Papua New Guinea for cultural and geographical reasons: Papua New Guinea is culturally quite different from the other countries in the region, and it is geologically not part of the continent of Asia, as the islands of the Sunda Shelf are (see Australia).

===Insulindia and East Indies===
Insulindia is a somewhat archaic geographical term for Maritime Southeast Asia, sometimes extending as far as Australasia. More common in Portuguese and Spanish, it is also sometimes used in art history or anthropology to describe the interface zone between the cultures of Oceania and Southeast Asia.

Insulindia is used as a geopolitical term in academic discussions of the former European colonial possessions within Maritime Southeast Asia, especially Dutch East Indies and Portuguese East Indies (&quot;&quot;Portuguese Insulindia&quot;) much as former French colonial possessions in Southeast Asia are still termed French Indochina. It is also used to describe and locate the Chinese cultural diaspora (the &quot;insulindian Chinese&quot;&quot;) across the islands of Southeast Asia.

The archipelago was called the &quot;East Indies&quot; from the late 16th century and throughout the European colonial era. It is still sometimes referred to as such, but broader usages of the &quot;East Indies&quot; term had included Indochina and the Indian subcontinent.

=== Maritime Southeast Asia, Island Southeast Asia, and Insular Southeast Asia ===
The term &quot;Maritime Southeast Asia&quot; is largely synonymous, covering both the islands in Southeast Asia and nearby island-like communities, such as those found on the Malay Peninsula.

== Geography ==

The land and sea area of the archipelago exceeds 2 million km2. The more than 25,000 islands of the archipelago consist of many smaller archipelagoes.

The major island groupings in the Indonesian Archipelago include the Maluku Islands, New Guinea, and the Sunda Islands. The Sunda Islands comprise two island groups: the Greater Sunda Islands and the Lesser Sunda Islands.

The major island groupings in the Philippine Archipelago include Luzon, Mindanao, and the Visayan Islands.

The seven largest islands are New Guinea, Borneo, Sumatra, Sulawesi and Java in Indonesia; and Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippines.

Geologically, the archipelago is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world. Producing many volcanoes especially in Java, Sumatra and Lesser Sunda Islands region where most volcanoes over high are situated. Tectonic uplifts also produce large mountains, including the highest, Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia, with a height of and Puncak Jaya on Papua, Indonesia at . Other high mountains in the archipelago include Puncak Mandala, Indonesia at and Puncak Trikora, Indonesia, at .

The climate throughout the archipelago is tropical, owing to its position on the equator.

=== Biogeography ===
Wallace used the term &quot;Malay Archipelago&quot; as the title of his influential book documenting his studies in the region. He proposed what would come to be known as the &quot;Wallace Line&quot;, a boundary that separated the flora and fauna of Asia and Australia. The ice age boundary was formed by the deep water straits between Borneo and Sulawesi; and through the Lombok Strait between Bali and Lombok. This is now considered the western border of the Wallacea transition zone between the zoogeographical regions of Asia and Australia. The zone has a mixture of species of Asian and Australian origin, and its own endemic species.
