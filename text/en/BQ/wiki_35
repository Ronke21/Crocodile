<text>Carlo Gesualdo da Venosa (between 8 March 1566 and 30 March 1566 – 8 September 1613) was an Italian nobleman and composer. Though both the Prince of Venosa and Count of Conza, he is better known for writing madrigals and pieces of sacred music that use a chromatic language not heard again until the late 19th century. He is also known for killing his first wife and her aristocratic lover upon finding them &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Gesualdo&#x27;s family had acquired the principality of Venosa, in what is now the Province of Potenza, Southern Italy, in 1560. He was probably born on March 30, 1566, three years after his older brother, Luigi, though some sources have stated that he was born on March 8. Older sources give the year of birth as 1560 or 1561, but this is no longer accepted. A letter from Gesualdo&#x27;s mother, Geronima Borromeo, indicates that the year is most likely 1566. Gesualdo&#x27;s uncle was Carlo Borromeo, later Saint Charles Borromeo. His mother was the niece of Pope Pius IV.

Carlo was most likely born at Venosa, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, but little else is known about his early life. &quot;His mother died when he was only seven, and at the request of his uncle Carlo Borromeo, for whom he was named, he was sent to Rome to be set on the path of an ecclesiastical career. There he was placed under the protection of his uncle Alfonso (d. 1603), then dean of the College of Cardinals, later unsuccessful pretender to the papacy, and ultimately Archbishop of Naples.&quot; His brother Luigi was to become the next Prince of Venosa, but after his untimely death in 1584, Carlo became the designated successor. Abandoning the prospect of an ecclesiastical career, he married, in 1586, his first cousin, Donna Maria d&#x27;Avalos, the daughter of Carlo d&#x27;Avalos, prince of Montesarchio and Sveva Gesualdo. They had one child, a son, Don Emmanuele.

Gesualdo had a musical relationship with Pomponio Nenna, though whether it was student-to-teacher, or colleague-to-colleague, is uncertain. Regardless of this, however, he had a single-minded devotion to music from an early age, and is said to have showed little interest in anything else. In addition to the lute, he played the harpsichord, and guitar. In addition to Nenna, Gesualdo&#x27;s &quot;accademia&quot; included the composers Giovanni de Macque, Scipione Dentice, Scipione Stella, Scipione Lacorcia, Ascanio Mayone, and the nobleman lutenist Ettorre de la Marra.

=== Homicide ===

Some years into her marriage with Gesualdo, Donna Maria began an affair with Fabrizio Carafa, third Duke of Andria and seventh Count of Ruovo. On the night of October 16, 1590, at the Palazzo San Severo in Naples, the two lovers were caught &quot;in flagrante&quot; by Gesualdo, who killed them both on the spot.

The day after the killing, a delegation of Neapolitan officials inspected the room in Gesualdo&#x27;s apartment where the killings had taken place, and interrogated witnesses. The delegation&#x27;s report did not lack in gruesome details, including the mutilation of the corpses and, according to the witnesses, Gesualdo going into the bedroom a second time &quot;because he wasn&#x27;t certain yet they were dead&quot;.

The Gran Corte della Vicaria found Gesualdo had not committed a crime.

=== Successor ===
About a year after the gruesome end of his first marriage, Gesualdo&#x27;s father died and he thus became the third Prince of Venosa and eighth Count of Conza. 

=== Ferrara years ===
By 1594, Gesualdo had arranged for another marriage, this time to Leonora d&#x27;Este, the niece of Duke Alfonso II. That year, Gesualdo ventured to Ferrara, the home of the d&#x27;Este court and also one of the centers of progressive musical activity in Italy, especially the madrigal; Gesualdo was especially interested in meeting Luzzasco Luzzaschi, one of the most forward-looking composers in the genre. Leonora was married to Gesualdo and moved with him back to his estate in 1597. In the meantime, he engaged in more than two years of creative activity in the innovative environment of Ferrara, surrounded by some of the finest musicians in Italy. While in Ferrara, he published his first book of madrigals. He also worked with the &quot;concerto delle donne&quot;, the three virtuoso female singers who were among the most renowned performers in the country, and for whom many other composers wrote music.

In a letter of June 25, 1594, Gesualdo indicated he was writing music for the three women in the &quot;concerto delle donne&quot;; however, it is probable that some of the music he wrote, for example, that in the newly developing monodic and/or concertato styles, has not survived.

=== Return to Gesualdo and final years ===

After returning to his castle at Gesualdo from Ferrara in 1595, he set up a situation similar to the one that existed in Ferrara, with a group of resident virtuoso musicians who would sing his own music. While his estate became a center of music-making, it was for Gesualdo alone. With his considerable financial resources, he was able to hire singers and instrumentalists for his own pleasure. He rarely left his castle, taking delight in nothing but music. His most well-known music was published in Naples in 1603 and from the castle of Gesualdo (with printer ) in 1611. The most notoriously chromatic and difficult portions of it were all written during his period of self-isolation.

The relationship between Gesualdo and his new wife was not good; she accused him of abuse, and the Este family attempted to obtain a divorce. She spent more and more time away from the isolated estate. Gesualdo wrote many angry letters to Modena where she often went to stay with her brother. According to Cecil Gray and Peter Warlock, &quot;She seems to have been a very virtuous lady ... for there is no record of his having killed her.&quot;

In 1600, Gesualdo&#x27;s son by his second marriage died. It has been postulated that after this Gesualdo had a large painting commissioned for the church of the Capuchins at Gesualdo, showing Gesualdo, his uncle Carlo Borromeo, his second wife Leonora, and his son, underneath a group of angelic figures; however, some sources suspect the painting was commissioned earlier, as the identity of the child is unclear.

Late in life he suffered from depression. According to Campanella, writing in Lyon in 1635, Gesualdo had himself beaten daily by his servants, keeping a special servant whose duty it was to beat him &quot;at stool&quot;, and he engaged in a relentless, and fruitless, correspondence with Cardinal Federico Borromeo to obtain relics, i.e., skeletal remains, of recently canonized uncle Carlo Borromeo, with which he hoped to obtain healing for his mental disorder and possibly absolution for his crimes. Gesualdo&#x27;s late setting of Psalm 51, the &quot;Miserere&quot;, is distinguished by its insistent and imploring musical repetitions, alternating lines of monophonic chant with pungently chromatic polyphony in a low vocal tessitura.

Gesualdo died in isolation, at his castle Gesualdo in Avellino, three weeks after the death of his son Emanuele, his first son by his marriage to Maria. One 20th-century biographer has raised the possibility that he was murdered by his wife. He was buried in the chapel , in the Church of the Gesù Nuovo, in Naples. The sepulchre was destroyed in the earthquake of 1688. When the church was rebuilt, the tomb was covered over, and now lies beneath it. The burial plaque, however, remains visible.

== Compositions and style ==

The evidence that Gesualdo was tortured by guilt for the remainder of his life is considerable, and he may have given expression to it in his music. One of the most obvious characteristics of his music is the extravagant text setting of words representing extremes of emotion: &quot;love&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;death&quot;, &quot;ecstasy&quot;, &quot;agony&quot; and other similar words occur frequently in his madrigal texts, most of which he probably wrote himself. While this type of word-painting is common among madrigalists of the late 16th century, it reached an extreme development in Gesualdo&#x27;s music.

His music is among the most experimental and expressive of the Renaissance, and without question is the most wildly chromatic. Progressions such as those written by Gesualdo did not appear again in Western music until the 19th century, and then in a context of tonality.

Gesualdo&#x27;s published music falls into three categories: sacred vocal music, secular vocal music, and instrumental music. His most famous compositions are his six books of madrigals, published between 1594 and 1611, as well as his &quot;Tenebrae Responsoria&quot;, which are very much like madrigals, except that they use texts from the Passion, a form (Tenebrae) used by many other composers. As in the later books of secular madrigals, he uses particularly sharp dissonance and shocking chromatic juxtapositions, especially in the parts highlighting text passages having to do with Christ&#x27;s suffering, or the guilt of St. Peter in having betrayed him.

The first books of madrigals that Gesualdo published are close in style to the work of other contemporary madrigalists. Experiments with harmonic progression, cross-relation and violent rhythmic contrast increase in the later books, with Books Five and Six containing the most famous and extreme examples (for instance, the madrigals &quot;Moro, lasso, al mio duolo&quot; and &quot;Beltà, poi che t&#x27;assenti&quot;, both of which are in Book Six, published in 1611). There is evidence that Gesualdo had these works in score form, in order to better display his contrapuntal inventions to other musicians, and also that Gesualdo intended his works to be sung by equal voices, as opposed to the &quot;concerted madrigal&quot; style popular in the period, which involved doubling and replacing voices with instruments. In addition to the works which he published, he left a large quantity of music in manuscript. This contains some of his richest experiments in chromaticism, as well as compositions in such contemporary avant-garde forms as monody. Some of these were products of the years he spent in Ferrara, and some were specifically written for the virtuoso singers there, the three women of the &quot;concerto di donne&quot;.

Characteristic of the Gesualdo style is a sectional format in which relatively slow-tempo passages of wild, occasionally shocking chromaticism alternate with quick-tempo diatonic passages. The text is closely wedded to the music, with individual words being given maximum attention. Some of the chromatic passages include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale within a single phrase, although scattered throughout different voices. Gesualdo was particularly fond of chromatic third relations, for instance juxtaposing the chords of A major and F major, or even C-sharp major and A minor, as he does at the beginning of &quot;Moro, lasso, al mio duolo&quot;.

==Reception==

The fascination for Gesualdo&#x27;s music has been fuelled by the sensational aspects of his biography. In 2011 Alex Ross wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:

In his own lifetime, the salacious details of Gesualdo&#x27;s killing of his first wife and her lover were widely publicized, including in verse by poets such as Tasso and an entire flock of Neapolitan poets, eager to capitalize on the sensation. The accounts of his cruelty were expanded with apocryphal stories such as the alleged killing of an illegitimate child of Donna Maria and her lover, which according to one variant of the made-up story was &quot;suspended in a bassinet and swung to the point of death&quot;. Until the 1620s his music was imitated by Neapolitan composers of polyphonic madrigals such as Antonio Cifra, Michelangelo Rossi, Giovanni de Macque, Scipione Dentice, Girolamo Frescobaldi and Sigismondo d&#x27;India.

After the Renaissance Gesualdo&#x27;s life story and his music were largely forgotten until the 20th century: in 1926 Gray and Warlock published their book on Gesualdo. The life of Gesualdo provided inspiration for numerous works of fiction and musical drama, including a novel by Anatole France and a short story by Julio Cortázar. Several composers responded to Gesualdo&#x27;s music: In 1960 Igor Stravinsky wrote &quot;Monumentum pro Gesualdo&quot;, containing an arrangement of Gesualdo&#x27;s madrigal &quot;Beltà, poi che t&#x27;assenti&quot;. In 1995 Alfred Schnittke wrote an opera based on Gesualdo&#x27;s life. Another Gesualdo opera was written by Franz Hummel in 1996. Salvatore Sciarrino arranged several of Gesualdo&#x27;s madrigals for an instrumental ensemble.

=== Legacy ===
The Conservatorio di Musica Carlo Gesualdo da Venosa ([State] Conservatory of Music Carlo Gesualdo do Venoza), Potenza, in the region of Basilicata, Italy, was founded in 1971 and named for the composer.

In &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; (1954), Aldous Huxley writes of Gesualdo&#x27;s madrigals:
Mozart&#x27;s C-Minor Piano Concerto was interrupted after the first movement, and a recording of some madrigals by Gesualdo took its place.

&#x27;These voices&#x27; I said appreciatively, &#x27;these voices – they&#x27;re a kind of bridge back to the human world.&#x27;

And a bridge they remained even while singing the most startlingly chromatic of the mad prince&#x27;s compositions. Through the uneven phrases of the madrigals, the music pursued its course, never sticking to the same key for two bars together. In Gesualdo, that fantastic character out of a Webster melodrama, psychological disintegration had exaggerated, had pushed to the extreme limit, a tendency inherent in modal as opposed to fully tonal music. The resulting works sounded as though they might have been written by the later Schoenberg.

&#x27;And yet,&#x27; I felt myself constrained to say, as I listened to these strange products of a Counter-reformation psychosis working upon a late medieval art form, &#x27;and yet it does not matter that he&#x27;s all in bits. The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order, is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren&#x27;t lulled into a sense of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages. But of course it&#x27;s dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn&#x27;t get back, out of the chaos...&#x27;
David Pownall&#x27;s play &quot;Music to Murder By&quot; (1976) juxtaposes the life of Gesualdo with that of twentieth-century composer Peter Warlock. In 1985 the French writer Michel Breitman published the novel &quot;&quot; based on the latter part of the life of Gesualdo. In 1995, Werner Herzog directed the film &quot;&quot; about the life and music of Gesualdo.

In the &quot;NME&quot; musician Anna Calvi named Gesualdo as one of her ultimate cult heroes:

Gesualdo&#x27;s name is used by The Gesualdo Six, a British vocal consort, directed by Owain Park. The group was founded in Cambridge in 2014 for a performance of the Tenebrae Responsories for Maundy Thursday in Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge. The group perform a broad-ranging repertoire, from the music of the medieval period through to contemporary compositions of the present day.

<text>A cold open (also called a teaser sequence) is a narrative technique used in television and films. It is the practice of jumping directly into a story at the beginning of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. In North American television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may also be used to recap events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode.

The cold open technique is sometimes used in films. There, &quot;cold opening&quot; still refers to the opening moments or scenes, but not necessarily to the full duration before the title card, as the title card might appear well after the start.

==Development==
In the early 1960s, few American series used cold opens, and half-hour situation comedies almost never made use of them prior to 1965. Many American series that ran from the early 1960s through the middle years of the decade (even sitcoms) adopted cold opens in later seasons. However, beginning in the late &#x27;50s, several dramatic series, notably such Warner Bros. shows as &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, would cold-open with an attention-grabbing scene from the middle of the episode, which would repeat when the story arrived at that point.

Cold opens became widespread on American television by the mid-1960s. Their use was an economical way of setting up a plot without having to introduce the regular characters, or even the series synopsis, which would typically be outlined in the title sequence itself.

British producer Lew Grade&#x27;s many attempts to break into the American market meant that various shows he was involved with incorporated the cold open. Later, many British action-adventure series employed the format, such as &quot;The New Avengers&quot; (1976–1977) and &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1977–1981).

During the 1960s and 1970s, daytime soap operas became the main users of cold opens, with most American soaps employing the format.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, some shows began with highlights from the previous episode. Also throughout the 1970s and 1980s, many traditional multi-camera sitcoms usually launched straight into the opening theme song, although this has changed in modern use. Today, between the 2000s and 2010s, most multi-camera and single-camera American sitcoms usually use cold opens for each episode, that last for at least 1–2 minutes (and 3–4 minutes at the most) before transitioning into the opening title sequence or theme song of the show.

Documentaries do not use cold openings as frequently as fictional shows. &quot;The World at War&quot; (1973–1974) is one famous exception, wherein a few short minutes an especially poignant moment is featured; after the title sequence, the events that explain the episode are outlined more fully.

==Current uses in television==
=== News ===
Most American news shows, including on channels providing 24-hour news coverage, use cold opens to introduce a summary of the stories covered in that edition.

===Dramas===
Cold opens are common in science fiction dramas and crime dramas. In the U.S., TV shows will occasionally forgo a standard cold open at the midway point of a two-part episode, or during a &quot;special&quot; episode. Vince Gilligan has been declared &quot;Undisputed Master of the Cold Open&quot; in multiple reviews, detailing particular episodes of &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; and &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. The Australian drama series, &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; used a cold open at the beginning of episodes for the majority of its run, before being phased out for its eighth and final season.

===Soap operas===
While several soaps experimented with regular opens in the early 2000s, all U.S. daytime dramas are currently using cold opens. Typically, a soap opera cold open begins where the last scene of the previous episode ended, sometimes replaying the entire last scene. After several scenes – usually, to set up which storylines will be featured in the episode – the opening credits are shown. By contrast, most British soap operas typically begin with regular opens. In Australia, soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; briefly used a cold open for a few episodes in 2006.

===Comedy===
One of the most well-known users of the technique, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; has regularly used a cold-open sketch since its start in 1975. Many modern American sitcoms use or used cold opens, such as &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, and &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;. Many other comedy formats also use cold opens, including late-night talk shows and satirical &#x27;news&#x27; shows. British show &quot;You’ve Been Framed!&quot; most notably used this in the Jeremy Beadle, Lisa Riley and Harry Hill eras. Sitcom cold opens often present a joke that has no relation to the episode&#x27;s plot.

===Children&#x27;s programming===
Several American children&#x27;s shows use cold opens, such as &quot;Pokémon&quot; for example, uses the technique to set up the main conflict or plot of the episode.

===Sports===
The &quot;UFC&quot; plays a cold open before a PPV main card, to build up anticipation for the fights that will follow.

==In other media==

===Film===
In film production, the section of the film before the opening credits is called the pre-credits, and they are sometimes crafted as a cold open. A classic example is the series of James Bond movies, which traditionally start with a cold open showing a dramatic conflict or chase scene after the usual gun barrel sequence and before the title sequence.

In some films, the title card does not appear until the end. In such cases, one cannot refer to the entire film as the &quot;opening&quot;, and the term &quot;cold open&quot; in these instances refers to the opening moments or scenes.

Likewise, in films with excessively long pre-credits sequences, the &quot;cold open&quot; does not necessarily refer to the entire pre-credits sequence.

===Podcasts===
Cold opens are occasionally used in the beginning of Podcasts and the reason for its utilization may change depending on the genre or theme of each respective Podcast and its frequency can vary. Some podcasts such as TrueAnon use a cold open at the start of every episode which may include either a skit or off-topic conversation between its two main hosts and producer before going into the intro of the podcast. Since early 2022, the weekly Nobody Listens to Paula Poundstone regularly employs cold opens, which often include the cast self-reflexively discussing the use and effectiveness of cold opens and &quot;grabbers.&quot;

===Radio===
Cold opens were also an occasional device in radio. Jack Benny&#x27;s weekly program would usually begin with Don Wilson reading standard copy announcing the name of the program and introducing the stars. Sometimes, however, particularly for a show at the start of a new season, the actors would launch into the material without any announcement and perform a sketch written to give the audience the impression they were eavesdropping on the stars&#x27; off-microphone lives. That would be followed by the more standard Don Wilson introductions and the show would proceed as usual after that.

===Video games===
Many video games have included cold opens. These either begin with a lengthy opening sequence or include an entire level before the titles. It is common in Japanese RPGs, with the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; an early example.

==Nomenclature==
Cold opens sometimes employ a segment known as a &quot;teaser&quot; or &quot;tease&quot;. A memorandum was written by Gene Roddenberry on May 2, 1966, as a supplement to the Writer-Director Information Guide for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, describing the format of a typical episode. This quotation refers to a cold open, commonly known as a teaser:
The &quot;hook&quot; of the teaser was some unexplained plot element that was alluded to in the teaser, or cold open, which was intended to keep audiences interested enough in the show to dissuade them from changing stations while the titles and opening commercial roll.

In television series, a similar technique called a &quot;cliffhanger&quot; is often employed before commercial breaks, to keep the audience from switching channels during the break.

A closing scene at the end of a show, after end credits, is known as the &quot;tag&quot;.

<doc id="494156" wikidata="Q328520" url="?curid=494156" title="Edgar Bronfman Jr.">
<text>Edgar Miles Bronfman Jr. (born May 16, 1955) is an American businessman, filmmaker, theater producer, and media executive who is a managing partner at Accretive LLC. He previously was CEO of Warner Music Group from 2004 to 2011, and was its chairman from 2011 to 2012. Bronfman was the CEO of WMG during its May 2011 sale to Access Industries. In August 2011, he became Chairman of the company as Stephen Cooper became CEO. Bronfman previously was CEO of Seagram and vice-chairman of Vivendi Universal. Bronfman expanded and later divested ownership of the Seagram Company, and also worked as a Broadway and film producer, and songwriter under the pseudonyms Junior Miles and Sam Roman. He is Chairman of FuboTV.

== Early life ==
Born in 1955, Edgar Jr. (&quot;Efer&quot; to friends) is the son of Edgar Miles Bronfman and the grandson of Samuel Bronfman, patriarch of one of the wealthiest and most influential Jewish families in Canada. The Bronfman family gained its fortunes through the Seagram Company, an alcohol distilling company. Edgar Jr. is the second of five children of Ann (née Loeb) and Edgar Miles Bronfman. His mother was the daughter of John Langeloth Loeb Sr. (a Wall Street investment banker whose company was a predecessor of Shearson Lehman/American Express) and Frances Lehman (a scion of the Lehman Brothers banking firm). His parents divorced in 1973.

== Business career ==
===Film production===
Bronfman proceeded to a brief career in entertainment in the 1970s as a film and Broadway producer. The summer before his final year of high school, in 1972, he was a credited producer on the film, &quot;The Blockhouse&quot;. He briefly had a production company, with Steve Sheppard, called Sagittarius. His Efer Productions company was signed by Universal Studios in 1977 to a three-year movie production contract. He produced the unsuccessful film &quot;The Border&quot; (1982), which starred Jack Nicholson.

===Seagram Company===
In 1982, Bronfman returned to the Seagram Company, before moving to London to become managing director of Seagram Europe. In 1984, Bronfman returned to New York as President of the House of Seagram, the company&#x27;s U.S. marketing division. By 1994, he became the Chief Executive Officer, where he began a move away from the traditional liquor business and into entertainment. According to &quot;Cigar Aficionado,&quot; Edgar Jr. led the family on a series of disastrous business deals, ultimately losing the family&#x27;s ownership of Seagram.

The first step in this diversification was the widely criticised sale of Seagram&#x27;s stake in DuPont. In 1981, Edgar Bronfman Sr. had sold Seagram&#x27;s stake in Conoco to DuPont, in exchange for almost 25% of the chemical giant. This stake in DuPont, by 1995, represented about 70% of Seagram&#x27;s total earnings. Nevertheless, Bronfman Jr., acting as Seagram CEO, approached DuPont about buying back its shares, a deal that DuPont wasted no time in closing.

With the proceeds of the $9 billion sale (equivalent to $ billion in ), Bronfman Jr. went on an expansion into the entertainment business, in music through the acquisition of PolyGram, and in film entertainment through MCA and Universal Pictures. However, the new entertainment conglomerate he created had a brief life, before needing a strategic partner. Bronfman Jr., then led Seagram into a controversial all-stock acquisition by French conglomerate Vivendi in 2000. Bronfman Jr., became chief of the new company, Vivendi Universal, but the Seagram company effectively lost control of its entertainment businesses. Meanwhile, the beverage division—the core of Seagram — was acquired by Pernod Ricard and Diageo and divided between the two firms. Seagram, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist.

In December 2001, Bronfman announced he was stepping down from an executive capacity at Vivendi Universal, but remaining as vice chair of the board.

In 2002, Bronfman joined private investment firm Accretive LLC as General Partner. The firm focuses on conducting deep market research and hand-selecting firms to back. Among its past projects are Accretive Health and Fandango (ticket service). Companies it currently backs include human resources firm AlphaStaff and small-business insurance company Insureon.

===Warner Music Group===
On February 27, 2004, Bronfman finalized the acquisition of Warner Music Group and was chairman and CEO of the music company for the following 7 years. Bronfman helped to transform WMG by rapidly growing the company&#x27;s digital music sales, redefining the relationships it has with artists, and diversifying its revenue streams through its expansion into growing areas of the music business. WMG held an initial public offering of stock in 2005 (NYSE: WMG), and is now the only standalone major music company to be publicly traded. While the stock has fallen from a high in 2005 of over $30 per share, the company has nonetheless produced double-digit growth in its digital business, increased its market share, and delivered stable revenue performance despite a drastic music industry decline during the same period. In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that WMG&#x27;s Atlantic Records became the first major record label to generate more than half of its music sales in the U.S. from digital products.

In May, 2011, WMG and Bronfman announced the company&#x27;s sale to Access Industries for US$3.3 billion cash. Access is controlled by Russian-born billionaire Len Blavatnik, a former board member and still-substantial shareholder of WMG at the time of the purchase announcement. The sale, coming after a three-month bidding process, &quot;serves the best interests of stockholders as well as the best interests of music fans, our recording artists and songwriters, and the wonderful people of this company,&quot; according to a statement released by Bronfman. CEO Bronfman would continue in his post in the transaction, though further job cuts were also foreseen. The investment group which has owned the company since 2004 was said to have received a positive return on its investment.

In August 2011, Bronfman became Chairman of Warner Music and Stephen Cooper became CEO. He stepped down as chairman on January 31, 2012. In February 2017, it was reported that Meredith Corp. and a group of investors led by Bronfman Jr. were considering pursuing Time Inc.

He is currently the chairman of Endeavor, an international non-profit development organisation that supports entrepreneurs.

===Waverley Capital===
In 2017, it was announced that Bronfman would be launching a new venture capital firm called Waverley Capital, alongside Luminari Capital founder Daniel Leff. This firm would invest in &quot;innovative and disruptive&quot; companies within both technology and entertainment, with offices in New York and Palo Alto, California, with a Los Angeles office expected to open in the future.

==Music career==
In 1973, Bronfman began a songwriting career under the pseudonyms Junior Miles and Sam Roman. He often collaborated with Bruce Roberts on songs like &quot;Whisper in the Dark&quot;, which he gave to Dionne Warwick to record in thanks for introducing him to his first wife, Sherry. Bronfman also co-wrote &quot;To Love You More&quot;, which was recorded by Celine Dion, and Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Love You&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Edgar M. Bronfman Jr., is the son of Edgar Bronfman Sr., the billionaire businessman and longtime president of the World Jewish Congress who died aged 84 in 2013. He is the half-brother of Clare Bronfman, who as a 39-year-old was charged in 2018 in a NXIVM sex-trafficking case.

In 1979, Bronfman married his first wife, the actress Sherry Brewer, in New Orleans. Bronfman&#x27;s father did not approve of the marriage because Brewer was Black. &quot;I very much wanted for him to end the relationship, because I told him, all marriages are difficult enough without the added stress of totally different backgrounds&quot;, Bronfman Sr. wrote in his memoirs. &quot;Sherry offered to convert [to Judaism], which though well intentioned, was not the point.&quot;

Bronfman and Brewer eloped and he and his father remained estranged. The couple had three children before they divorced in 1991: Benjamin (born 1982), Vanessa, and Hannah (born 1987).

In 1993 Bronfman married Clarisa Alcock San Román, a Catholic, the daughter of Frank Alcock Pérez-Matos, a Venezuelan oil executive of half British descent, and Dinorah San Román Strup. They have four children: Aaron, Bettina, Erik, and Clarissa.

== Insider trading conviction ==
On January 21, 2011, Bronfman was found guilty in French court of insider trading as Vivendi chief and received a 15-month suspended sentence and a €5m fine.

Considering the jail sentences handed out to other executives for similar convictions, BNN reporter Michael Kane told CTV News &quot;The fact that the judge suspended the jail time could be looked at as getting off lightly, perhaps.&quot;

He appealed the decision in 2011.

== Stance on music copyright infringement ==
At the height of file sharing service Napster&#x27;s popularity, Bronfman was a leading opponent of the illegal use of peer-to-peer technology. As CEO of Universal, he helped lead the music industry&#x27;s opposition to Napster, likening it to slavery and Soviet communism.

In 2006, WMG was the first major media company to create a business model around user-generated content and, more recently, has been pushing for ways to monetise the popularity of P2P networks on college campuses.

In late 2006 in an interview with Reuters, Bronfman caused a stir by admitting that his children have copyright infringing music. He claims to have delivered punishment for this but wants it to remain within the realm of the family.

Lately, Bronfman may have revised his judgement. During the GSMA Mobile Asia Congress, he told the audience that mobile operators should not make the same mistakes that the music industry has:

In 2010 Bronfman changed his philosophy on the music industry&#x27;s online business models, stating that he does not support free advertising supported models. He said that WMG will focus on promoting services that require payment, that will appeal to the population that already pays for downloads in stores such as iTunes.

<doc id="494158" wikidata="Q441606" url="?curid=494158" title="Title sequence">
<text>A title sequence (also called an opening sequence or intro) is the method by which films or television programmes present their title and key production and cast members, utilizing conceptual visuals and sound (often an opening theme song with visuals, akin to a brief music video). It typically includes (or begins) the text of the opening credits, and helps establish the setting and tone of the program. It may consist of live action, animation, music, still images and graphics. In some films, the title sequence is preceded by a cold open.

==History==

Since the invention of the cinematograph, simple title cards were used to begin and end silent film presentations in order to identify both the film and the production company involved, and to act as a signal to viewers that the film had started and then finished. In silent cinema, title cards or intertitles were used throughout to convey dialogue and plot, and it is in some of these early short films that we see the first examples of title sequences themselves, being quite literally a series of title cards shown at the beginning of a film. With the arrival of sound, the sequence was usually accompanied by a musical prelude or overture.

Slowly, title sequences evolved to become more elaborate pieces of film. The advent of television was a pivotal moment for title design because it forced the major film studios to invest in making cinema more attractive in order to win back a diminishing audience. The &quot;cast of thousands&quot; epics shot on various patent widescreen formats were a direct response to television&#x27;s successful invasion of the leisure marketplace. Part of cinema&#x27;s new prestigious and expansive quality were orchestral overtures before the curtains opened and long title sequences — all designed to convey a sense of gravitas it was hoped television would be unable to compete with. As cinema&#x27;s title sequences grew longer and more elaborate, the involvement of prominent graphic designers including Saul Bass and Maurice Binder became more common. The title sequence for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; is generally cited as the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography. This innovation, in turn, influenced the 1960s television predilection for title design, resulting in the creation of strong graphics-led sequences for many television shows. Since then, the mediums of film and television have engaged in a kind of push and pull behavior, inspiring and spurring each other in different directions.

There have been several such pivotal moments in title design history. The introduction of digital technologies in the late 1980s and early 1990s to film and television changed both industries, and accordingly the 1990s saw a resurgence in title design. Ironically, a key sequence in this resurgence was the main title to David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Se7en&quot;, designed by Kyle Cooper while at R/GA, which was created using primarily analogue means. The title opticals for &quot;Se7en&quot; were created by Cinema Research Corporation, the leading title company in the 1990s. Soon thereafter, television followed suit and networks like HBO began to develop more cinematic experiences for television, including more elaborate and considered title sequences. For example, when &quot;The Sopranos&quot; first aired in 1999, it was only the second hour-long television drama that HBO had ever produced. Its title sequence &quot;helped lend the show a credibility and gravitas normally reserved for cinema, giving it a stronger foothold in the mind and memory of the audience.&quot;

As of the beginning of the 21st century, title sequences can be found bookending a variety of media besides film and television including video games, conferences, and even music videos.

==Films==
Some films have employed unusual and fairly elaborate title sequences since the late 1910s; in America this practice became more common in the 1930s. In the 1936 film &quot;Show Boat&quot;, cut-out figures on a revolving turntable carried overhead banners which displayed the opening credits. This opening sequence was designed by John Harkrider, who created the costumes for the original 1927 Broadway production of the musical.

In several films, the opening credits have appeared against a background of (sometimes moving) clouds. These include &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946), the David Lean &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), and the 1961 &quot;King of Kings.&quot;

In 1947, the Technicolor film &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;, the letters of the opening credits seem to form from colored water gushing into a fountain.

Film titles and credits usually appear in written form, but occasionally they are spoken instead. The first example of this in American cinema was &quot;The Terror&quot; (1928). There are also a few cases in which titles and credits are sung, including the musicals &quot;Sweet Rosie O&#x27;Grady&quot; (1943) and &quot;Meet Me After the Show&quot; (1951).

Since the late 1950s, film title sequences have been a showcase for contemporary design and illustration. The title sequences of Saul Bass and Maurice Binder are among the best examples of this. They also inspired many imitators both in cinema and on television.

In the 1959 film &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, the opening credits were set against the background of the &quot;Creation of Man&quot; in Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel ceiling. As the credits progressed, the camera slowly zoomed in on the Hand of God outstretched toward Adam.

In 1976, Saul Bass designed a title sequence for &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot; in which he paid homage to a range of title sequences from earlier Hollywood films and replicated several novelty title sequences from the 1930s including &quot;Maytime&quot; (1937).

Kyle Cooper&#x27;s title sequence for David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Seven&quot; (1995) influenced a whole host of designers in the late 1990s. Its aesthetic has &quot;been co-opted almost wholesale by the horror genre as a house style&quot;.

Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996) actually has no opening title sequence. The only credits seen at the beginning are the name of the production company, Shakespeare&#x27;s name, and the title of the film. However, the title is shown by means of the camera slowly panning across the base of the statue of the dead king Hamlet, whose ghost will appear in three scenes of the film, and who will play a crucial role in the story.

==Television==
Title sequences for television series have routinely played a central role in establishing the show&#x27;s identity. Repeated at the beginning of every new and rebroadcast episode, usually with limited changes over the course of the series&#x27; run, they can become highly memorable. Theme music played during the sequence may be remembered clearly by viewers decades later.

Title sequences can take a variety of forms, incorporating different elements. A song may summarize the backstory or premise of the series, such as for &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, or &quot;Mister Ed&quot;. Less commonly, a voice-over may serve the same function, as for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, or &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Often a song will more generally set the theme of the series, such as for &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, or &quot;All in the Family&quot;. An instrumental piece may be used the same way, as for &quot;Taxi&quot;, &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, or &quot;Dallas&quot;. A title sequence will at some point badge the show with a typographic logo. Visuals may be used to quickly present the backstory, as in &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; or &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Because it is produced at the outset of a series, the sequence will usually include visuals taken from early episodes already shot when it was prepared. Short clips of key characters may be used to introduce them and to credit the actors playing them, as with &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In and around these elements may be other footage depicting the setting, or examples of scenes common to the show (e.g. car chases for a police drama, household activities for a sitcom, singing and dancing for a variety show).

Although a title sequence may be modified during a series to update cast changes or incorporate new &quot;highlight&quot; shots from later episodes, it will tend to remain largely the same for an entire season. Some shows have had several quite different title sequences and theme music throughout their runs, while in contrast some ever-popular shows have retained their original title sequences for decades with only minor alterations. Conversely, retaining a series&#x27; original title sequence can allow a producer to change many key elements within a programme itself, without losing the show&#x27;s on-screen identity. Other variations include changing only the theme music whilst keeping the visuals or vice versa.

Some series make minor changes to the title sequence of each episode, such as superimposing a different episode title on each one. Others make minor alterations to the content of the sequence itself, to keep them from being completely repetitive each episode and to reward attentive viewers. For example, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; would feature a different message left on the title character&#x27;s answering machine, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; features several unique elements in the title sequence of each episode (e.g. the couch gag).

In anime series, opening and ending title sequences have evolved into a distinct art form in their own right: due to the running length of a half-hour block of programming on Japanese television providing more time for the actual episode as opposed to commercials, an episode is able to budget one-and-one-half minutes each for an OP (opening sequence) and ED (ending sequence). These will invariably feature pieces of vocal music, sometimes sung by members of the voice cast for the program, and will have unique animation that thematically serves to open and close the episode; often, guest animators will be brought in to direct and provide key animation for these sequences. The OP credits will usually include director, producer, animation director, studio, music, and OP animation credits: detailed staff and voice cast is almost always reserved for the ED. In anime produced primarily for an audience of young children, karaoke lyrics to the song will sometimes be provided at the bottom of the opening and ending sequences. For further information on anime openings, see Music in Japanese animation.

Television specials, especially of classic works, sometimes contain unusual opening credit sequences. In the title sequence of Mikhail Baryshnikov&#x27;s 1977 version of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, for example, we see closeups, freeze-frame and slow-motion shots of Baryshnikov and female lead Gelsey Kirkland &quot;warming up&quot; for the ballet. When the actual title appears on the screen we see Baryshnikov in his nutcracker costume and mask leaping into the air in slow motion and freeze frame. The &quot;Overture Miniature&quot; is heard during the opening credits.

In contemporary television news a title sequence can be changed every day, by including footage of that day&#x27;s news with a presenter&#x27;s voice &quot;teasing&quot; the items. This ensures that the title sequence appears fresh but still identifies the news program by its music and visual style.

In 2010, &quot;TV Guide&quot; published a list of American TV&#x27;s top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers. The series, in order of first to tenth, were: &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, the original &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;True Blood&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Dexter&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;Mad Men&quot;, and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

==Video games==

The animated introduction, attract mode, title screen, and title sequence have been a major part of video games for decades. However, it is only recently that game title sequences have been able to match the quality and fidelity of film and television titles.

&quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&quot; by Eidos Montréal and &quot;The Last of Us&quot; by Naughty Dog are two examples of Triple-A games that have employed film-style opening title sequences. Professor Layton and the Lost Future had the title following some gameplay setting up the story.

<text>Closing credits, end credits and end titles are a list of the cast and crew of a particular motion picture, television show, and video game. While opening credits appear at the beginning of a work, closing credits appear close to, and at the very end of a work. A full set of credits can include the cast and crew, but also production sponsors, distribution companies, works of music licensed or written for the work, various legal disclaimers, such as copyright and more. 

Typically, the closing credits appear in white lettering on a solid black background, often with a musical background. Credits are either a series of static frames, or a single list that scrolls from the bottom of the screen to the top. Occasionally closing credits will divert from this standard form to scroll in another direction, include illustrations, extra scenes, bloopers, joke credits and post-credits scenes.

== History ==
The use of closing credits in film to list complete production crew and the cast was not firmly established in American film until the late 1960s and early 1970s. Films generally had opening credits only, which consisted of just major cast and crew, although sometimes the names of the cast and the characters they played would be shown at the end. Two of the first major films to contain extensive closing credits – but almost no opening credits – were the blockbusters &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956) and &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961). &quot;West Side Story&quot; showed only the title at the beginning of the film, and &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; had no opening credits at all.

<text>Stephen Briggs (born 1951) is a British writer of subsidiary works and merchandise surrounding Terry Pratchett&#x27;s comic fantasy &quot;Discworld&quot;. &quot;The Streets of Ankh-Morpork&quot;, the first Discworld map, was co-designed by Briggs and Pratchett and painted by Stephen Player in 1993. This was followed by &quot;The Discworld Mapp&quot; (1995), also painted by Stephen Player, and &quot;A Tourist Guide to Lancre&quot; (1998), painted by Paul Kidby.

Briggs also adapted over 20 Pratchett novels for the amateur stage – &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, &quot;Mort&quot;, and &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; (published by Corgi); &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;, &quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot;, and &quot;Dodger&quot; (Oxford University Press); &quot;Going Postal&quot;, &quot;Night Watch&quot;, &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; and &quot;The Truth&quot; (Methuen / A.&amp; C. Black); &quot;Making Money&quot;, &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; and &quot;Maskerade&quot; (Samuel French); &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;, &quot;The Rince Cycle&quot; – mainly a combination of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; – and &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot; (Oberon); his adaptations of &quot;Hogfather&quot; and &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; were published in 2021 by Methuen Drama, along with &quot;The Shakespeare Codex&quot; – mainly an adaptation of &quot;The Science of Discworld 2 - the Globe&quot; .

The Discworld encyclopaedia &quot;The Discworld Companion&quot;, published in 1995 with updated editions in 1997 and 2003 (the latter entitled &quot;The New Discworld Companion&quot;, is derived from Briggs&#x27; database of Discworld information). The fourth edition of the Companion was published in 2012 under the title &quot;Turtle Recall&quot;. In 2007 Briggs published &quot;The Wit and Wisdom of Discworld&quot;, a compilation of quotes from the Discworld novels. He also collaborated with Pratchett in &quot;Discworld Diaries&quot; and &quot;Nanny Ogg&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;. Briggs has also recorded audiobook versions of certain &quot;Discworld&quot; works, in editions released by Isis Publishing and by HarperCollins in the US.

In 2004, he received an Audie Award for his audiobook recording of &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;.

<doc id="494174" wikidata="Q635115" url="?curid=494174" title="Opening credits">
<text>In a motion picture, television program or video game, the opening credits or opening titles are shown at the very beginning and list the most important members of the production. They are now usually shown as text superimposed on a blank screen or static pictures, or sometimes on top of action in the show. There may or may not be accompanying music. When opening credits are built into a separate sequence of their own, the correct term is a title sequence (such as the familiar &quot;James Bond&quot; and &quot;Pink Panther&quot; title sequences).

Opening credits since the early 1980s, if present at all, identify the major actors and crew, while the closing credits list an extensive cast and production crew. Historically, however, opening credits have been the only source of crew credits and, largely, the cast, although over time the tendency to repeat the cast, and perhaps add a few players, with their roles identified (as was not always the case in the opening credits), evolved. The ascendancy of television movies after 1964 and the increasingly short &quot;shelf-life&quot; of films in theaters has largely contributed to the credits convention which came with television programs from the beginning, of holding the vast majority of cast and crew information for display at the end of the show.

In movies and television, the title and opening credits may be preceded by a &quot;cold open,&quot; or teaser (in other words, a brief scene prior to the main acts), that helps to set the stage for the episode or film.

==History in cinema==

Up until the 1970s, closing credits for films usually listed only a reprise of the cast members with their roles identified, or even simply just said &quot;The End,&quot; requiring opening credits to normally contain the details. For instance, the title sequence of the 1968 film &quot;Oliver!&quot; runs for about three-and-a-half minutes, and while not listing the complete cast, does list nearly all of its technical credits at the beginning of the film, all set against a background of what appear to be, but in fact are not, authentic 19th-century engravings of typical London life. The only credit at film&#x27;s end is a listing of most of the cast, including cast members not listed at the beginning. These are set against a replay of some of the &quot;&#x27;Consider Yourself&quot; sequence.

Some opening credits are presented over the opening sequences of a film, rather than in a separate title sequence. The opening credits for the 1993 film &quot;The Fugitive&quot; continued intermittently over several opening scenes, and did not finish until fifteen minutes into the film. The opening credits for the 1968 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; lasted for fourteen minutes.

The first sound film to begin without any opening credits was Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;, released in 1940. In the film&#x27;s general release, a title card and the credit &quot;Color by Technicolor&quot; were spliced onto the beginning of the film, but otherwise there were no credits, although closing credits were added to the 1990 re-release and are on the videocassette. This general release version has been the one most often seen by audiences. In the roadshow version of the film, unseen by most audiences until its DVD release, the title card is seen only at the halfway point of the film, as a cue that the intermission is about to begin. The intermission was omitted in the general release version.

Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; begins with only a title credit. This practice was extremely uncommon during that era.

&quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) begins with a shot of an ink sketch of the New York City skyline as it was when the film was made. As the background of the shot changes color several times, we hear an overture medley (not in the original show) of some of the film&#x27;s songs. As the overture ends, the camera pulls back and we see the title of the film. The rest of the credits are shown as graffiti at the end.

Most Disney films released between 1937 and 1981 had all the film-related information in the opening credits, while the closing consisted only of the credit &quot;The End: A Walt Disney Production or Walt Disney Productions&quot;. However, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was the first Disney film to have longer closing credits, in which all the principal cast members (and the characters that they played) were listed.

Most Soviet films presented all film-related information in the opening credits, rather than at the closing which consisted of only a &quot;THE END&quot; (, &quot;Konyets Fily-ma&quot;) title. A typical Soviet opening credits sequence starts with a film company&#x27;s logo (such as Mosfilm or Lenfilm), the film&#x27;s title, followed by the scenarist (the Soviet Union considered the scriptwriter the principal &quot;auteur&quot; of its films), followed by the director, usually on separate screens, then continuing with screens showing other credits, of varying number, and finally, the film&#x27;s chief administrator-in-charge, the production director (, &quot;Direktor kartiny&quot;). Following this came the cast, usually in actor-and-role format for all principal and major featured players, and perhaps then a screen only naming, in an alphabetical cluster, some additional character players. The final credit screen identified the studio corresponding to the logo at the beginning, and the year of the film&#x27;s production. It could also contain the frame with the technical information about the cinematographic film manufacturer (e.g., Svema).

This basic method was also followed in most American films from the 1930s through the late 1980s. American films also tended to list the names of the actors before the names of the directors, screenwriters, and other principal crew members. Exceptions were made in the films of director Frank Capra, whose name was usually billed before the film&#x27;s title. Director Victor Fleming&#x27;s name was also billed before those of the actors in films such as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;. Capra, Fleming, and James Whale were some of the few directors who received the credit &quot;A [director&#x27;s name] Production&quot; even though they did not produce their films.

François Truffaut&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; uses spoken opening credits instead of written ones, in keeping with the film&#x27;s story of a world without reading matter, as well as Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Contempt&quot; of 1963.

George Lucas is credited with popularizing this with his &quot;Star Wars&quot; films which display only the film&#x27;s title at the start. His decision to omit opening credits in his films &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) led him to resign from the Directors Guild of America after being fined $250,000 for not crediting the director during the opening title sequence. However, Hollywood had been releasing films without opening credits for many years before Lucas came along, most notably &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

&quot;Title-only&quot; billing became an established form for summer blockbusters in 1989, with &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; and &quot;The Abyss&quot; following the practice. Clint Eastwood has omitted opening credits (except for the title) in every film that he has directed since approximately 1982.

By the 2000s, many major American motion pictures had done away with opening credits, with many films, such as &quot;Van Helsing&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Batman Begins&quot; in 2005, not even displaying the film title until the closing credits begin. 

==Credit only==

With regard to television series, it is now an accepted practice to credit regular cast members for every episode of a season, even if they did not appear in each episode. One example is the American television series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, in which the appearance of all credited characters is rare. Another television series that credited all regulars for a season in every episode (regardless of whether or not they appeared) was &quot;Lost&quot;, most notably from season two onward, in which the complete credited cast appeared in only two episodes out of 23. During &quot;Lost&quot;″s fourth season, Harold Perrineau was credited for all thirteen episodes, despite only having appeared in five of them (fewer than some guest stars, such as Jeff Fahey).

The series &quot;Charmed&quot; also began by crediting every regular cast member even if they did not appear in the episode. The season two episode &quot;Morality Bites&quot; is the only episode in which only the three leading actresses were credited, and later the male cast members were only credited in the episodes in which they appeared. If a regular actor was not featured in that particular episode, the opening credits were edited with their images omitted and the actors not being credited.

The television series &quot;Police Squad!&quot;, in keeping with its parodic nature, featured a character who only appeared in the credits (&quot;...and Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln&quot;).

==Soap operas==
Traditionally, actors in daytime soap operas are not credited in the episode opening sequences; this has been the case because of the escapist tone of the soap opera genre and as such, producers of soaps did not want cast members credited in the opening sequence in order to keep this intact. The drawback to this is that cast members are often identified by fans as their soap opera personas and not as themselves, as opposed to actors on other television programs who, in many cases, were identifiable by their own name.

In the 2000s, some soap operas began using an opening sequence where the actors are credited. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; was the first such show to credit, at least, most of the actors on contract with the series. &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, which is produced by Bell-Phillip Television Productions (a subsidiary of &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; producer Bell Dramatic Serial Company), began crediting all contract cast members in its opening titles in 2004, four years after &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; implemented it (however, unlike &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; cycles between different title sequences depending on the episode&#x27;s running time: two that feature credits – including one shorter sequence – and one that does not feature any credits or cast member visuals). ABC Daytime soaps began implementing the process in October 2002 with the debut of the &quot;All My Children&quot; &#x27;Scrapbook&quot; opening used until May 2004. &quot;One Life to Live&quot; began featuring character credits within the title sequence during the same time period with its &quot;Blue and White&quot; opening. The most recent soap to include credits for all contract actors in its opening titles was &quot;General Hospital&quot; after a February 2010 revamp of its opening credits (a credit-less introduction resumed in 2012 with the introduction of a shorter title sequence), though during the final years of its &quot;Faces of the Heart&quot; sequence from April 2003 to September 2004, the names of the main characters were shown alongside video headshots of the cast members in the opening title sequence.

Often, only the Friday episode of a daytime serial would run closing credits listing the actors. All performers from the preceding five episodes would be listed. Starting in the 2000s, complete end credits began running more frequently. &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in particular currently credits all actors, those on contract, on recurring status and with guest starring roles on the show that week, alternating every other episode with a closing credit sequence showing the program&#x27;s crew members; in either instance, either version is shown after the producer, director and writing credits (&quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; credit all performers during their closing credits, although the latter two only credit recurring and guest cast members are credited for their appearance that week only and &quot;General Hospital&quot; mainly credits only main and recurring cast members).

British soaps have never credited cast members or crew members in their opening titles nor do they show video or images of the cast members. However, in recent years these programmes have listed the writers, producers and directors over the first scene of the episode and episode titles if they apply. The opening titles of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; feature regular characters in short (less than one second) scenes intended to capture their character.

==Common opening credits order==
While there are numerous variations most opening credits use some variation of the basic order. In the absence of opening credits, these roles will often be credited in reverse order at the beginning of the closing credits.

* (NAME OF THE STUDIO) or (NAME OF THE STUDIO) PRESENTS
: Name of the studio that is distributing the film and may or may not have produced it (for example, the major film studios like Walt Disney Pictures, Universal Pictures, or Warner Bros.)

* (NAME OF THE PRODUCTION COMPANY)
: Name of the production company that actually made the film or name of the investment groups or companies that financed a substantial part of the film (usually credited as &quot;in association with&quot; or &quot;A [production company name] production.&quot;).

* POSSESSORY CREDIT/S
: The primary artistic credit for the film. Generally the film director, but sometimes the producer or writer. Normally stylized &quot;A film by [name]&quot; or &quot;A [name] film&quot;. Sometimes placed before a title. (E.g. &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Psycho&quot;).

* STARRING
: Principal actors (sometimes the stars&#x27; and director&#x27;s credits will be reversed, depending on the star&#x27;s deal with the studio; in other cases, as in the Rodgers and Hammerstein films, or as in all three film versions of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, or, as in many Disney films, the title of the film will be shown before the names of the production company, its possessory credit, and its actors; sometimes, as in many of Cannon&#x27;s films, the name(s) of the principal actor(s) will be shown before the name(s) of the producer(s), i.e. &quot;The Cannon Group presents X in a Golan-Globus production of a Y film&quot;).

* (FILM&#x27;S TITLE)
: Name of the film.

* FEATURING or WITH or AND or ALSO STARRING
: Featured actors.
As a variation some of the below may be noted:

* &quot;GOWNS&quot; (older movies)
* &quot;SOUND RECORDING&quot; (older movies)
* CASTING or CASTING BY
: Casting director. Those who are members of the Casting Society of America will have the post-nominal letters &quot;CSA&quot; after their name.

* MUSIC or MUSIC COMPOSED BY or ORIGINAL SCORE BY
: Composer of music.

* VISUAL EFFECTS PRODUCER or VISUAL EFFECTS SUPERVISOR
: VFX Studio

* COSTUME DESIGN or COSTUME DESIGNER
: Costume designer.

* EDITOR or EDITED BY
: Film Editor. Those who are members of the American Cinema Editors will have the post-nominal letters &quot;ACE&quot; after their name.

* PRODUCTION DESIGN or PRODUCTION DESIGNER
: Production designer.

* DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
: Director of photography.
: Members of the following societies will have post-nominal letters after their name:
:* American Society of Cinematographers: ASC
:* British Society of Cinematographers: BSC

* PRODUCER or PRODUCED BY, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
: Producers, co-producers, executive producers, &#x27;also produced by&#x27; (credited for various reasons according to contracts and personal scrutiny of the principal producer). Often, though, the name of the producer will be the second-to-last opening credit, just before the writer&#x27;s name(s) are shown (Pursuant to WGA rules, writer credits are immediately adjacent to the Director.).

:Those who have been certified by the Producers Guild of America that they actually performed a major portion of the producing duties of the film will have the &quot;Producers Mark&quot; certification mark--the post-nominal letters &quot;p.g.a.&quot;--after their names.

* BASED ON THE BOOK (PLAY, GRAPHIC NOVEL etc.) BY or FROM A PLAY/BOOK BY (older movies)
: If based on a book or other literary work.

* BASED ON THE CHARACTERS BY or BASED ON THE CHARACTERS CREATED BY
: If based on characters from a book or other media.

* (SCREEN) STORY or STORY BY
: Person who wrote the story on which the script is based, gets &quot;story by&quot; credit, and the first screenplay credit, unless the script made substantial changes to the story.

* WRITER(S) or WRITTEN BY or SCREENPLAY or SCREENPLAY BY
: Screenplay writers. The Writers Guild of America allows only three writing credits on a feature film, although teams of two are credited as one, separated on the credits by an ampersand (&quot;X &amp; Y&quot;). If each works independently on the script (the most common system), they are separated by an &quot;and&quot;. If more than two persons worked on the screenplay, the credits may read something like &quot;screenplay by X &amp; Y and Z and W,&quot; meaning that X and Y worked as a team, but Z and W worked separately.

* DIRECTOR or DIRECTED BY
: Director. The Directors Guild of America usually permits a film to list only one director, even when it is known that two or more worked on it. Exceptions are made in rare cases such as a death and subsequent replacement of the director mid-production as well as for established directing teams such as the Coen brothers.

<text>Salona (, ) was an ancient city and the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia. It was the last residence of the final western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos and acted as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Western Roman Empire during the years 476-480. Salona is located in the modern town of Solin, next to Split, in Croatia.

Salona was founded in the 3rd century BC and was mostly destroyed in the invasions of the Avars and Slavs in the seventh century AD.

Many Roman characteristics can be seen such as walls, a forum, a theatre, an amphitheatre, public baths and an aqueduct.

==History==
Salona grew in the area of the Greek cities of Tragurium and Epetium on the river Jadro in the 3rd century BC. It was the birthplace of Roman Emperor Diocletian. In the first millennium BC, the Greeks set up a marketplace. Salona had also been in the territory of the Illyrian Delmatae, before the conquest of the Romans. Salona became the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia, because it sided with the future Roman Dictator Gaius Julius Caesar in the civil war against Pompey. Martia Iulia Valeria Salona Felix (the full name of the ancient city) was founded probably after the Roman civil wars under Julius Caesar. The early Roman city encompassed the area around the Forum and Theatre, with an entrance, the Porta Caesarea, on the north-east side. The walls were fortified with towers during the reign of Augustus. The early trapezoidal shape of the city was transformed by the eastern and western expansion of the city.

The city quickly acquired Roman characteristics: walls, a forum, a theatre, an amphitheatre which are the most conspicuous above-ground remains today, public baths, and an aqueduct. Many inscriptions in both Latin and Greek have been found both inside the walls and in the cemeteries outside, since Romans forbade burials inside the city boundaries. Several fine marbles sarcophagi from those cemeteries are now in the Archaeological Museum of Split. All this archaeological evidence attests to the city&#x27;s prosperity and integration into the Roman Empire. Salona had a mint that was connected with the mint in Sirmium and gold and silver mines in the Dinaric Alps through Via Argentaria.

When the Roman Emperor Diocletian retired, he erected a monumental &quot;villa&quot; (palace) in a suburban location (6 km away). This massive structure, known as Diocletian&#x27;s Palace, after Salona&#x27;s fall became the core of the city of Split (Spalatum). Diocletian&#x27;s tomb was reportedly also somewhere near Salona.

Salona&#x27;s continuing prosperity resulted in the extensive church building in the fourth and fifth centuries, including an episcopal basilica and a neighboring church and baptistery inside the walls, and several shrines honoring martyrs outside. These have made it a major site for studying the development of Christian sacred architecture. The Salonitan bishop held the position of metropolitan bishop of Dalmatia. After the fall, bishopric and other remains were transferred to Split (see Archbishopric of Spalathon). The borders and influence of Salonitan Archdiocese included almost all of today&#x27;s Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina south of river Sava and west of river Drina.

Salona was the only Eastern Adriatic port-city listed in Diocletian&#x27;s Edict on Maximum Prices, and out of all listed port-cities it had most maritime connections (those being with Alexandria, Ephesus, Nikomedia, Seleucia Pieria, and Carthago). The connection with Ravenna was also prominent. The connections were not only about exchange of goods and monuments, prominent individuals also traveled, remained to live and die at Salona (especially from Syria). Seemingly it was a big port as for the Battle of Sena Gallica (551), Byzantine general Jon sailed from it with 38 ships (compared to Ravenna&#x27;s 12).

Salona is the largest archaeological park in Croatia. According to Constantine VII&#x27;s &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (10th century), Salona was &quot;half as large as Constantinople&quot;. Initially believed that grew to over 60,000 inhabitants, recent excavations found it was for one third larger than originally thought by the archaeologists.

===Fall===

In the early 7th century the Roman limes on river Danube and Sava fell and was militarily abandoned, leaving Roman province of Dalmatia open for conquest. The events of the fall of the city because to its location are relevant to the understanding when the province and coastal cities periphery succumbed to barbaric invasion. Pope Gregory I in July 600 wrote to the archbishop of Salona, Maximus, in which he expresses concern about the arrival of the Slavs (&quot;de Sclavorum gente quae vobis valde imminet et affligor vehementer et conturbor&quot;). According to &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (10th century) and Thomas the Archdeacon&#x27;s &quot;Historia Salonitana&quot; (13th century), Salona was largely destroyed in the seventh century invasions of the Avars and Slavs (more specifically the Croats per Thomas the Archdeacon who also identified them with Goths and Slavs). In the &quot;DAI&quot;&#x27;s chapters 29 and 30 on the history of Dalmatia and fall of Salona, the terms Avars and Slavs were interchangeably used but, most probably, generally meant the Slavs. The city was reportedly conquered by trickery when the Avar-Slavs, previously defeating at the river Danube or Sava (possibly also near Cetina) a Roman army dispatched from Salona/Klis, in disguise passed the frontier castrum of Klis and expelled the Romans from the city. When it became their possession, they &quot;settled and thereafter began gradually to make plundering raids and destroyed the Romans who dwelt in the plains and on the higher ground and took possession of their lands&quot;. Refugees from Salona settled in other coastal and island cities (Decatera, Ragusa, Spalato, Tetrangourin, Diadora, Arbe, Vekla and Opara) and inside Diocletian&#x27;s Palace.

The exact date of destruction and fall is uncertain. Pope John IV sent abbot Martin (possibly future Pope Martin I) to Dalmatia in 641 to redeem captives, which was interpreted that Salona must have been destroyed before that date. As Salona&#x27;s refugees are also said by Thomas the Archdeacon to have founded Ragusa around 625 it meant that Salona had to be destroyed around 625 or before. In the scholarship, it was traditionally dated to 614, although opinions varied between 608 and 639. The last dated inscription, reflecting existence of life in the city, in the ruins is dated to 12 May 612. However, 1970s were found many coins, out of which few were of Heraclius and youngest minted in 630/631. It is interpreted as evidence that the city was rather becoming steadily abandoned after 614 and probably destroyed in 639. Some other archaeological excavations probably show a small group of people continued to live with newcomers until mid-7th century when it became abandoned. Tibor Živković argued that the attack happened in the early 630s and became abandoned after that time.

The new Slavic population settled outside the ruins to the East near river Jadro, where are found Old-Croat graves. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Croatian kings founded and rebuilt three churches, of which of St. Stephen was used as a royal mausoleum of Croatian Kings (with found sarcophagus of Croatian Queen Helen of Zadar), while of St. Peter and Moses (so-called Hollow Church) was crowned king Demetrius Zvonimir. The archaeologically confirmed information is found in &quot;Historia Salonitana&quot;.

==Architecture==
Various town structures have been excavated.

=== Manastirine ===
These are the remnants of the Basilica and cemetery outside of the town. The earliest parts of the complex date back to the second century BC. The bishop and martyr Domnio was buried here after being executed in the arena of the amphitheater on 304AD.

At the end of the fourth century, the complex was partly destroyed during the German incursions, and in the mid-fifth century, a three-nave basilica was constructed on top of the ruins. Many sarcophagi can be found here. in the early seventh century, the cemetery was looted and partly destroyed.

The cemetery exhibits a feature of Christian cemeteries at that time to have deceased buried as close as possible to the martyr or Ad sanctos.

=== Tusculum ===
Architectural and ornamental fragments, capitals inscriptions, and columns from the area were replaced in a building built in 1898. It was restored in 2008.

===City walls===

The construction of the Salonitan city walls took several centuries. The earliest part of the city was surrounded by walls as early as the second century BC. During the Pax Romana the city expanded to both east and west.

During the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius around 170 A.D., under the constant threat of Germanic tribes, the east and west suburbs were included in the walls, which were fortified with at least 90 towers. Some parts of existing buildings were used in the extensions to the walls, thus making them integral. The total circumference of the elliptical shape of the walls was approximately , with varying width from enclosing 240 acres .

During the reign of Emperor Theodosius II in the early fifth century, all the towers were reconstructed, as witnessed by an inscription on the walls. Furthermore, in the first half of the sixth century, triangular-shaped endings were added to some square-shaped towers to improve the city&#x27;s security and defense system. Such examples are visible today on the northern side of the Urbs orientalis.

=== Episcopal center ===
The center of Christian Salona is in the northwest part of the eastern city. Here is an Episcopal center with twin lengthways basilicas, a baptistery, and Bishop&#x27;s Palace were built in the fifth century A.D.

This Basilica is the largest in the entire area of Dalmatia. The best-preserved part of the oldest part of the city (Urbs vetus) is the eastern wall and Porta Caesarea with two octagonal towers and three passages; one for cart traffic and two for pedestrians on each side of the wider passage. The central passage was probably equipped with a movable grid, as indicated by grooves on side pylons.

=== Aqueduct ===
Emperor Augustus built an aqueduct to supply the city with water from the river Jadro. It was in length, and the best-preserved part is north of the episcopal center. Calculations show that the aqueduct could supply enough water for about 40,000 people.

===Thermae===

The thermae were typical buildings of Roman civilization and an indispensable part of Roman urban life. Although the city of Salona had multiple baths, the best-preserved and largest ones are those in the eastern part of the city called the Great Thermae, built in the second or beginning of the third century A.D. This building is rectangular, with three symmetrically arranged apses in the north and one in the west. There was an adjoining elongated spacious room to the north, housing a semicircular pool, the piscina, filled with cold water, the frigidarium. There were two dressing rooms to the left, with benches for sitting and openings in the wall for clothes. The room to the west was also used as a massage room, the unctorium. The room ending with an apse served both as a lounge and an exercise room. To the right there were hot baths and sauna: caldarium, tepidarium and sudatorium.

===Bridge of Five Arches===
In the eastern suburb of Salona, five arches spanned the westernmost backwater of the river Jadro. The bridge carried one extension of Decumanus Maximus which branched into two roads, one of which led north-east to the Porta Andetria gate, while the other one led across the bridge to Epetium, today&#x27;s city of Stobreč.

=== Porta Caesarea ===
The Porta Caesarea is a well-preserved gate with two octagonal towers and three passages, one for cart traffic and two for pedestrians on each side of the wider passage. The central passage was probably equipped with a movable grid, as indicated by grooves on side pylons. Porta Caesarea was constructed using large regular stones primarily for fortification purposes. After eastern and western expansion had occurred, the gate lost its primary purpose and became carrying construction of the aqueduct. According to Kähler&#x27;s reconstruction, the gate had two floors, of which the top one was very elaborately decorated with half columns, composite capitals, and window openings. Within the gate, there was a small courtyard for defense purposes.

=== Praetorium ===
Southeast of the ports Caesarea, a luxurious villa has been uncovered, which was probably the palace of the Roman governor of Dalmatia. Several mosaics depicting mythological figures such as Apollo Orpheus and Triton have been transferred to the archaeological museum in Split.

=== Forum ===
The center of the town&#x27;s public life was in the southeast part of the old town. It is in size. After the fourth century A.D., as the town became more Christian, the forum started to lose its role as the city center.

=== Theatre ===
A theater in size was built in the first century A.D.

=== Temple ===
South of the theater, there is a temple that was dedicated to either Dionysus or Liber.

=== Kapljuc ===
These ruins are the remnants of the oldest cemetery basilica. It was built in the middle of the fourth century above the graves of four Praetorian guards who were executed in the arena during Diocletian&#x27;s persecution of Christians.

===Amphitheatre===

At the westernmost point of Salona, in the second half of the second century A.D., under the influence of Flavian architectural style, a monumental building was erected. The presence of a Roman amphitheater indicates that gladiator fights were held in the city of Salona until the fifth century, when they were finally banned. The building was ellipsoidal in shape, with three floors on the south side and one floor on the north side, conveniently laid down on a natural hillside. Despite its relatively small size ( outer shell and the arena), the Salonitan amphitheater could have been occupied by 15,000 up to 18,000 spectators. The auditorium was divided into three tiers, the lower two with seats and the upper one for standing. In Diocletian&#x27;s time, the top tier was covered with a porch. Through poles attached to the outer shell of the building, the whole arena could be covered with canvas, giving protection from the sun and rain. There was a state box for the Province governor on the south side and opposite it seats of honor for the city magistrates. In the center of the arena, an opening led into an underground corridor whose purpose was the disposal of dead gladiators&#x27; bodies. On the south side of the amphitheater, beneath the auditorium, there were two vaulted rooms where gladiators worshipped Nemesis, the goddess of revenge and destiny. During Diocletian&#x27;s persecutions of Christians, the amphitheater was used as a site of executions.

Only parts of substructures of this monumental building, as well as some fragments of architectural decoration and stone sculpture, have been preserved. The amphitheater was most severely damaged during the wars against the Turks in the 17th century when Venetians had it demolished for strategic reasons.

=== Marusinac ===
This cemetery complex has the martyr Anastasios thrown into the bay with the grindstone around his neck in 304 AD. The mausoleum was built in the early fourth century. In the fifth and sixth centuries, other bishops and priests were buried here.

=== Gradina ===
Gradina means a medieval hill fort built on the east walls by the Turks after capturing Klis.

=== City necropolises ===

 Burying the dead inside the city was against Roman law, so Romans buried their dead on the roads leading out of the city.

<doc id="494189" wikidata="Q660263" url="?curid=494189" title="What's My Line?">
<text>What&#x27;s My Line? is a panel game show that originally ran in the United States, between 1950 and 1967, on CBS, originally in black and white and later in color, with subsequent American revivals. The game uses celebrity panelists to question contestants in order to determine their occupation. The majority of the contestants were from the general public, but there was one weekly celebrity &quot;mystery guest&quot; for whom the panelists were blindfolded. It is on the list of longest-running American primetime network television game-shows. Originally moderated by John Charles Daly and most frequently with regular panelists Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, and Bennett Cerf, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; won three Emmy Awards for &quot;Best Quiz or Audience Participation Show&quot; in 1952, 1953, and 1958 and the Golden Globe Awards for Best TV Show in 1962.

More than 700 episodes exist as kinescope recordings, filmed in 16mm, which was the only way moving pictures and sound from spontaneous, unscripted television shows could be preserved on a long-term basis prior to the emergence and subsequent widespread use of videotape. Many early episodes were lost because of economic decisions made by CBS executives between 1950 and 1952. Every episode from July 1952 to September 1967 existed for a long time in the archive of producers Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, but some of the episodes were lost in 1975.

After the Sunday night series&#x27;s cancellation by CBS in 1967, it returned in a syndication package for local television stations that committed to airing it five days a week. This version originally was hosted by Wally Bruner and later by Larry Blyden. It was seen by viewers from 1968 to 1975. There have been a dozen international versions, radio versions, and a live stage version. Revivals in the U.S. were proposed several times, but all of them failed to go past the planning stages. New episodes have not been created for American television since December 12, 1974.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; ninth on its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever and &quot;Time&quot; ranked it as one of the 100 &quot;All-Time&quot; TV shows ever.

==Original CBS series (1950–1967)==
Produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman for CBS, the show was initially called &quot;Occupation Unknown&quot; before deciding on the name &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; The original series, which was usually broadcast live, debuted on Thursday, February 2, 1950, at 8:00 p.m. ET. After airing alternate Wednesdays, then alternate Thursdays, finally on October 1, 1950, it had settled into its weekly Sunday 10:30 p.m. ET slot where it would remain until the end of its network run on September 3, 1967.

Starting in July 1959, and continuing until July 1967, the show would occasionally record episodes onto quadruplex videotape for playback at a future date. In July 1959, this was state-of-the-art technology. At that time, the immediate concern of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was that John Daly, anchor of the ABC network&#x27;s nightly newscasts, would be allowed to visit Moscow to cover, in that capacity, a breaking news story. While Daly moderated the first live episode after his return from Moscow, he praised his employers&#x27; use of videotape. In such instances, cast and crew worked on two episodes consecutively during the same Sunday night: the &quot;taped&quot; one, followed immediately by the &quot;live&quot; one. The cast and crew began taking &quot;summer breaks&quot; from the show in July 1961, through July 1967. The closing credits of each prerecorded episode included an acknowledgment of the prerecorded status by the offscreen announcer.

===Hosts and panelists===


The host, then called the moderator, was veteran radio and television newsman John Charles Daly. Clifton Fadiman, Eamonn Andrews, and Random House co-founding publisher and panelist Bennett Cerf substituted on the four occasions when Daly was unavailable.

The show featured a panel of four celebrities who questioned the contestants. On the initial program of February 2, 1950, the panel comprised former New Jersey governor Harold Hoffman, columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, poet Louis Untermeyer, and psychiatrist Richard Hoffmann. The panel varied somewhat in the following weeks, but after the first few broadcasts, during the show&#x27;s earliest period the panel generally consisted of Kilgallen, actress Arlene Francis, Untermeyer and comedy writer Hal Block. Publisher Bennett Cerf replaced Untermeyer as a regular panelist in 1951, and comedian Steve Allen replaced Block in 1953. Allen left in 1954 to launch &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; and he was replaced by comedian Fred Allen (no relation), who remained on the panel until his death in 1956.

Fred Allen was not replaced on a permanent basis, and for the majority of the show&#x27;s network run, between 1956 and 1965, the panel consisted of Kilgallen, Cerf, Francis and a fourth guest panelist. After Kilgallen&#x27;s death in 1965, she was similarly not replaced with a permanent panelist, and for the show&#x27;s final two years, the panel consisted of Cerf, Francis and two guests.

At various times, a regular panelist might take a vacation or be absent from an episode due to outside commitments. On these occasions, a guest panelist would take their spot. The most frequent guest panelist was Arlene Francis&#x27;s husband Martin Gabel, who appeared 112 times over the years. Other frequent guest panelists include Tony Randall, Robert Q. Lewis and Phyllis Newman. Dick Cavett, in an early television appearance in Fred Allen&#x27;s vacated chair in 1966, noted that the mystery guest was probably wondering who Cavett was.

Regular announcers included Lee Vines, who served from 1950 to 1955; Hal Simms, from 1955 to 1961; Ralph Paul, whose tenure was confined to 1961; and Johnny Olson, perhaps the best known of Goodson-Todman&#x27;s television announcers, whose tenure began in 1961 and ran until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1967.

====Timeline of regular panelists====
===Gameplay===
&quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; was a guessing game in which the four panelists attempted to determine the occupation (i.e., &quot;line [of work]&quot;) of a guest. In the case of the famous mystery guest each week, the panel sought to determine the identity of the celebrity. Panelists were required to probe by asking only yes–no questions. A typical episode featured two standard rounds (sometimes a third, and very rarely a rushed fourth) plus one mystery guest round. On the occasions on which there were two mystery guests, the first would usually appear as the first contestant.

====Standard rounds====
For the first few seasons, contestants would &quot;sign in&quot; by writing their name on a chalkboard, and meet the panel up close for a casual inspection, and the panel was allowed one initial &quot;wild&quot; guess. The first contestant on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; was Pat Finch, a hat check girl at the Stork Club. Finch appeared again on the fifth anniversary show (with the &quot;line&quot; of &quot;chorus girl&quot; appearing in the musical &quot;Fanny&quot;) and on the final broadcast in 1967 as a guest.

Beginning in 1955 Daly simply greeted and seated the contestant, who later met the panel at the end of the game. Additionally, starting April 17, 1955, the panel stopped taking initial guesses. The contestant&#x27;s line was then revealed to the studio and home audiences, and Daly would tell the panel whether the contestant was salaried or self-employed, and from 1960 on, whether they dealt in a product or a service.

A panelist chosen by Daly would begin the game. If their question elicited a yes answer, they continued questioning. When a question was answered no, questioning passed to the next panelist and $5 was added to the prize. The amount of the prize was tallied by Daly who flipped up to ten cards on his desk. A contestant won the top prize of $50 by giving ten no answers, or if time ran out, with Daly flipping all the cards. As Daly occasionally noted, &quot;Ten flips and they (the panel) are a flop!&quot; Daly later explained, after the show had finished its run on CBS, the maximum payout of $50 was to ensure the game was played only for enjoyment, and that there could never be even the appearance of impropriety. Later in the series, Daly would throw all the cards over with increasing frequency and arbitrariness (frequently to give a particularly interesting or worthy contestant the maximum available prize money), evidence the prize was secondary to game play.

Panelists had the option of passing to the next panelist—or even disqualifying themselves entirely if they somehow knew the contestant&#x27;s occupation or identity (especially in the case of a mystery challenger) before the round. They could also request a conference, in which they had a short time for open discussion of ideas about occupations or lines of questioning.

Panelists adopted some basic binary search strategies, beginning with broad questions, such as whether the contestant worked for a for-profit corporation or non-profit organization or whether a product was alive, worn, or ingested. To increase the probability of affirmative answers, panelists would often phrase questions in the negative starting with &quot;Is it something other than...&quot; or &quot;Can I rule out...&quot;

The show popularized the phrase, &quot;Is it bigger than a breadbox?&quot; Steve Allen first posed this on January 18, 1953, and it was then refined over subsequent episodes. Soon, other panelists were asking this question as well. On one occasion the guest was a man who made breadboxes. Allen correctly guessed the guest&#x27;s occupation when Daly could not restrain his laughter in response to Kilgallen asking, &quot;Is it bigger than a breadbox?&quot;

====The mystery guest round====

The ultimate or penultimate round of an episode involved blindfolding the panel for a celebrity guest appearance (originally called &quot;mystery challengers&quot; by Daly) whom the panel had to identify by name, rather than occupation. (In the first episode, the mystery guest was New York Yankees shortstop Phil Rizzuto.) In the early years of the show, the questioning was the same as it was for regular contestants, but starting with the April 17, 1955 edition, panelists were only allowed one question at a time. Mystery guests usually came from the entertainment world, either stage, screen, television or sports. When mystery guests came from other walks of life or were non-famous individuals whom the panel but not the studio audience might know, they were usually played as standard rounds. However, the panel might be blindfolded, or the contestant might sign in simply as &quot;X,&quot; depending on whether they would be known by name or sight.

Mystery guests would usually attempt to conceal their identities with disguised voices, much to the amusement of the studio audience. According to Cerf, the panel could often determine the identities of the mystery guests early, as they knew which celebrities were in town, or which major movies or plays were about to open. On those occasions, to provide the audience an opportunity to see the guest play the game, the panelists and host would typically allow questioning to pass around at least once before coming up with the correct guess. As Cerf admitted in the episode broadcast on November 27, 1966, his wife, Phyllis, was frequently told the name of the mystery guest beforehand.

Sometimes, two mystery guest rounds were played in an episode, with the additional round usually as the first round of the episode.

Most notably, the mystery guests ran the gamut of show business&#x27;s most legendary icons, including Jack Benny, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Elizabeth Taylor, Ella Fitzgerald, Ava Gardner, Joan Crawford, James Cagney, Julie Andrews, Jack Lemmon, Jackie Gleason, Steve McQueen, Alfred Hitchcock, Doris Day, James Garner, Ronald Reagan, Jane Russell, Rosalind Russell, Fred Astaire, George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, Gene Autry, Lena Horne, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, Andy Griffith, Harry Belafonte, Ginger Rogers, Roy Rogers, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Sean Connery, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Salvador Dalí, Aretha Franklin, and many more.

===Style===
&quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; is known for its attention to manners and class. In its early years, business suits and street dresses were worn by the host and panelists, but by 1953, the men normally wore black suits with bow tie (a few guests in fact wore black tie) while female panelists donned formal gown and often gloves. Exceptions to this dress code were on the broadcasts immediately following the deaths of Fred Allen and Dorothy Kilgallen, in which the male cast members wore straight neckties and the women wore simpler dresses.

The game followed a line of formality and adherence to rules. Although using first names at other points, Daly usually addressed using surnames when passing the questioning to a particular panelist. He would also amiably chide the panel if they began a conference without first asking him.

However, even with such formality, Daly was not above trading &quot;bon mots&quot; with the panelists during the game, and Cerf would often attempt to make a pun of his name. Occasionally Daly would amiably one-up Cerf if he felt the pun was of lesser quality. Cerf also played a myriad of games with Daly&#x27;s full name, John Charles Patrick Croghan Daly, reciting it correctly only a handful of times over the course of the series.

Often Daly would need to clarify a potentially confusing question, but he had a penchant for amusingly wordy, long-winded replies that often left panelists more confused than before, which Danny Kaye once parodied as a panelist. On more than one occasion, Daly &quot;led the panel down the garden path&quot; – a favorite phrase used when an answer had proven misleading to the panelists.

===Broadcast format===
From 1950 to 1966, the game show was broadcast in black and white, as was typical of most game shows at the time. In September 1966, all three networks began broadcasting their prime-time schedules entirely in color television, including &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; The new color episodes were preserved only with black-and-white kinescopes, however, and even several of those from 1967 were lost. The color composition of the &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; soundstage has been lost to posterity.

The show began as a live broadcast but during the last eight years many episodes were videotaped weeks or months in advance of their telecasts. The show&#x27;s announcer acknowledged this fact during the closing credits of every &quot;prerecorded&quot; episode.

====Radio====
In addition to the television version, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; was also broadcast on network radio for a short time. From May 20 to August 27, 1952, an NBC Radio Network version was produced on Tuesday nights with the same cast as the TV version. After August 27, the program was then broadcast live on CBS Radio on Wednesday nights at 8:00 PM for 10 months, concluding July 1, 1953. The radio version is notable for the only appearances of Marlene Dietrich, Constance Bennett, and Marlon Brando.

====1953 Community Chest Special====
A Community Chest Special, completely separate from the regular production of episodes, was broadcast live on all the major networks (CBS, ABC, NBC, and DuMont) on the afternoon of Sunday, September 27, 1953.

===Production practices===
====On-camera====
The program began with Daly and panel entering from off-stage as they were introduced. Prior to 1954, both panelists and host began the program in their seats, but this was changed, responding to letters asking what panelists looked like away from their seats. The first panelist would be introduced by the announcer following the show&#x27;s introduction, and each panelist would introduce the next in turn, with the last introducing Daly. During his tenure, Hal Block sat in the final seat and began the practice of introducing Daly with a pun. Upon his departure, Bennett Cerf took over this position. Cerf&#x27;s introductions of Daly were generally straightforward in his earliest years on the show, but as time went by Cerf expanded these introductions, often telling long jokes which he tied to Daly in some way.

To begin a round, Daly would invite the contestant to &quot;come in and sign in, please,&quot; which, by 1960, had evolved to the more familiar &quot;enter and sign in, please.&quot; The contestant entered by writing his or her name on a small sign-in board. (For the first few telecasts, the contestants signed their names on an artist&#x27;s sketch pad; but when the brightness of the studio lights made it difficult for the signatures to be seen clearly by the viewers, the white sketchpad was replaced by a black chalkboard.) Daly would then usually ask where the guest lived and, with a woman, if she should be addressed as &quot;Miss&quot; or &quot;Mrs.&quot; Early in the show&#x27;s run, the panel was allowed to inspect contestants, studying their hands, or label on their suit or asking them to make a muscle.

While ostensibly a game show, if there was time, it also was an opportunity to conduct interviews. &quot;Line&#x27;s&quot; sister show, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret,&quot; and later, the syndicated version of &quot;WML&quot; engaged in the practice of contestants demonstrating their talents. However, despite frequent requests by the panel, particularly Arlene Francis, such demonstrations rarely occurred as according to executive producer Gil Fates, Daly was not fond of this practice.

====Sponsors====
After the first four episodes, the show gained its initial sponsor when Jules Montenier paid to have his product, Stopette spray deodorant, featured in advertising on the program. This involved featuring the product in the show&#x27;s opening, on the front of the panel&#x27;s desk, above the sign-in board, and on Daly&#x27;s scorecards. In his last years, Cerf explained to interviewer Robbin Hawkins that Montenier was ultimately ruined by his refusal to abandon or share sponsorship as the show entered new markets and became too expensive. After Montenier sold Stopette to Helene Curtis, the series was sponsored by a variety of companies which were either regular or rotating. Sponsors were accorded the same exposure on the set as Stopette. One of the first rotating sponsors, which actually came before Montenier&#x27;s sale of Stopette to Helene Curtis (who continued to sponsor the program after the purchase and still promoted Stopette in their advertising), was the Remington Rand Corporation, who used their time to promote their line of electric shaver and computers such as the UNIVAC.

Near the end of its run, sponsors would be introduced in the opening title and given commercials during the show, but would not be displayed on the set. Frequent sponsors in the 1960s were Kellogg&#x27;s cereals, Allstate Insurance, and Geritol.

====Behind the scenes====
Unknown to the public, mystery guests were paid $500 (equal to $ in ) as an appearance fee, whether they won or lost the game. This was in addition to the maximum $50 (equal to $ in ) game winnings, which guests sometimes donated to charity. Guest panelists were paid $750 (equal to $ in ) as an appearance fee. The regular panelists were under contract and were paid &quot;much more,&quot; according to Fates. Bennett Cerf explained that when he became a permanent member of the program, he was paid $300 (equal to $ in ) per week, and he told Robbin Hawkins in their interview that by the end of the series, the panelists were being paid &quot;scandalous amounts of money.&quot;

====Studio locations====
The first four episodes (#001 – #004; February – March 16, 1950) were broadcast live from a converted loft at the former CBS Studio 41 Grand Central Studios at Grand Central Terminal (15 Vanderbilt Ave., NY).

Beginning with the first Wednesday episode (#005; April 12, 1950, and continuing until around 1951), the show was broadcast from the now demolished CBS Studio 51 (Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre, aka Maxine Elliott Theatre, 109 W. 39th St., NY).

At least by episode #034 (January 21, 1951), the show moved to CBS Studio 59 (Mansfield Theatre, later renamed the Brooks Atkinson Theatre in 1960, 256 W. 47th St., NY), and stayed until Episode #516, June 5, 1960. Meanwhile, the concurrent 1952–1953 Radio edition, at least during the CBS run, was heard live from CBS Studio Building 22 (49 E. 52nd St., NY).

Episode #225 (September 19, 1954) was a color edition of the show, broadcast live from CBS Studio 72 (on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side, Broadway at 81st St., NY). This predated the show&#x27;s eventual move to color by 12 years.

Episode #323 (August 12, 1956), in conjunction with the 1956 Democratic National Convention, was a special Chicago episode broadcast from the studios of CBS owned-and-operated WBBM-TV (630 N. McClurg Ct., Chicago, IL).

Episode #397 (January 12, 1958) was a special Hollywood episode broadcast from CBS Television City (7800 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA). The moderator and panel&#x27;s desks were not brought over, as they had been for the Chicago special.

Beginning with episode #517 through episode #829 (June 12, 1960 – September 4, 1966), the show used CBS Studio 52 (254 W. 54th St., NY; the future Studio 54). The last episode aired in black &amp; white was taped on July 17, 1966, and the last episode to be produced there in black &amp; white aired live on July 24.

For the final season, from episode #830 to episode #876 (September 11, 1966 – September 3, 1967), in conjunction with the program&#x27;s permanent move to color, the show used CBS Studio 50 (later renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater, 1697 Broadway at 53rd St., NY).

===The final CBS network show===
CBS announced in early 1967 that a number of game shows, including &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, were to be canceled at the end of the season. Bennett Cerf wrote that the network had decided that game shows were no longer suitable for prime time, and that the news was broken by &quot;The New York Times&quot; on February 14 before anyone involved with the show was notified. The primary reason for the cancellation, along with the other panel shows CBS aired in prime time, was that the programs&#x27; low overall viewership—the key metric of success during Michael Dann&#x27;s time with the network—could no longer justify their presence even as the shows continued to turn a profit with their low production costs.

The 876th and final CBS telecast of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; aired on September 3, 1967; it was highlighted by clips from past telecasts, a visit by the show&#x27;s first contestants, a challenger from the New York unemployment office, and the final mystery guest, who was John Daly himself. Daly had always been the emergency mystery guest in case the scheduled guest was unable to appear on the live broadcast, but this had never occurred. Mark Goodson, Bill Todman and (briefly) Johnny Olson appeared on-camera as well.

===Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings===
==Syndicated revival (1968–1975)==
===Premiere===
Once the original &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; had ended, Goodson-Todman struck a deal with CBS&#x27;s syndication arm, which in time became the present-day Viacom (now CBS Media Ventures), to syndicate a new weekday videotaped edition, beginning one year after the network version&#x27;s cancellation. This version became a staple of local stations&#x27; afternoon and early evening schedules, especially from the 1971–72 season onward, when the FCC forced networks to cede one half-hour to their affiliates. The Prime Time Access Rule was intended to permit local stations to produce news and public affairs programming, but instead many of them turned to programs like &quot;WML,&quot; as practically all stations outside the largest markets found it unprofitable to produce their own shows locally.

The first three seasons (1968–1971) originated from Studio 50, the home of the final year of the original series, but with a new, modern-design set. In 1971, production of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; moved from the Broadway studio to Studio 6-A at NBC in Rockefeller Center, and the series remained there for the rest of its run, with a set redesign in 1974 for the final season. As they had with the original series, Goodson-Todman went to ABC News to seek a host, whose title had ceased to be that of &quot;moderator,&quot; and hired Wally Bruner to take over for John Charles Daly. Bruner left the series at the conclusion of its fourth season in 1972, and Broadway actor Larry Blyden, who had already helmed several other gameshows and served as both a &quot;Line&quot; panelist and mystery guest in the past, stepped in at the beginning of the 1972–1973 season to host the remaining three seasons.

===Panelists===
The syndicated edition had two regular panelists for its entire run, with comedian Soupy Sales joining the returning Arlene Francis. Bennett Cerf appeared as a guest on an irregular basis until he died during production of the fourth season in 1971. Other panelists included Alan Alda, his father Robert Alda, Joanna Barnes, Joyce Brothers, Jack Cassidy, Bert Convy, Joel Grey, Elaine Joyce, Ruta Lee, Sam Levene, Meredith MacRae, Henry Morgan, Jerry Orbach, Gene Rayburn, Nipsey Russell, Gene Shalit, Dana Valery and Anita Gillette.

===Look and style===
Unlike its predecessor, the syndicated &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; did not emphasize formality as the panelists did not dress in formal wear. In addition, the panelists were simply referred to by name and only their first names were displayed in front of them. The show did manage to keep some elements of the original series intact, as the cartoon introduction used during the final two seasons on CBS was reused with new music added. The panelists also entered in the same manner as they had before with Soupy Sales (or the panelist occupying the seat farthest left when he was absent) coming out first and introducing the person sitting next to them, and continuing down the line to Arlene Francis (or whoever occupied her seat while she was absent), who would then introduce the host. That practice continued until the beginning of the final season in 1974, when announcer Chet Gould began introducing the panelists and host Blyden at once, in a conventional fashion.

===Who&#x27;s Who? segment===
In the 1960s and 1970s syndicated run, whenever there was extra time, a special game was instituted called &quot;Who&#x27;s Who.&quot; Four members of the studio audience were lined up on stage, and their occupations were printed on cards. Each panelist had 20 seconds to take those occupation cards to the appropriate contestant (the ones who they thought had that occupation). Each time one panelist failed, the audience team won $25 and another panelist took a turn. If all four panelists failed, each member of the team won an additional bonus prize. The game ended when the panel was stumped or if a panelist placed the occupations with the right contestants. If the panelists got it correct on the first try, the audience members received $5 and a year&#x27;s supply of Turtle Wax.

The producers considered the revival a merger of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and its 1950s spinoff, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret,&quot; which resulted in noticeable changes from the original. As with &quot;Secret,&quot; contestants frequently demonstrated their skill or product after the game. Bruner, and later Blyden, would preface the demonstrations by asking Lloyd Gross, who directed most of the editions, &quot;Lloyd, would you open the curtains, please?&quot; Dollar signs for &quot;no&quot; answers were replaced by sequential numbers. Mystery guest rounds were no longer scored and simply ended with a correct guess or when time ran out.

The set, designed by veteran Goodson-Todman art director Theodore Cooper, was predominantly blue and featured walls behind the panel and host areas tiled with illustrations representing various occupations. This set debuted when the show premiered, made the move from Broadway to Rockefeller Center in 1971, and was used until the end of the 1973–74 season.

===Fates&#x27; Law===
From 1973 to 1975 the name of producer Gil Fates was invoked by host Larry Blyden on every episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; As Blyden explained before introducing mystery guest Paul Lynde: &quot;It&#x27;s time to tell the audience and the members of the panel, especially those watching the program over the last 22 years, about a new development known as Fates&#x27; Law. Fates&#x27; Law is that any member who guesses who the mystery guest is and is wrong is then out. That&#x27;s Fates&#x27; Law.&quot; Fates himself explained that the rule was named by Blyden but actually inspired by panelist Soupy Sales: &quot;Soupy knows everybody in show business. He could identify even the most obscure comic or nightclub singer despite the most bizarre vocal disguise... [the new rule] cut down a bit on the number of instant solutions, not only from Soupy but also from other panelists who had a tendency to guess.&quot;

===Later introductions===
For the 1974–75 season, the show&#x27;s set was changed. The tiles were done away with in favor of having blue walls with question marks painted on them, and the rest of the set adopted a red and yellow color palette. Also, the animated intro was done away with in favor of the show&#x27;s announcer (usually Gould) offering a brief preview of one of the contestants&#x27; games.

A bright, contemporary music package was composed by Charles Fox. According to Fox&#x27;s book, &quot;Killing Me Softly: My Life in Music,&quot; Bob Israel of Score Productions paid him a buyout fee of $1,000) for the work. The music was performed and recorded at CTS Studios in Wembley, England, with Fox, Israel and producer Mark Goodson in attendance.

===Announcers===
Johnny Olson continued as announcer until a short time into the 1972–73 season, when he departed for California to begin his tenures as announcer of the revivals of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (which he continued to do until his passing in 1985) and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; (1972–73).

Following Olson&#x27;s departure, a succession of guest announcers were used, including Wayne Howell, Dennis Wholey, Bob Williams, Jack Haskell and Chet Gould, with Gould eventually taking over full-time in early 1973. Gene Wood also sub-announced an episode in 1970.

===After the death of Bennett Cerf===
After Bennett Cerf&#x27;s death in 1971, stations continued to air shows where he was a panelist resulting in confusion among some fans, who were seeing &quot;new&quot; episodes with Cerf long after hearing about his death. At the time, syndication involved videotape-sharing among stations that aired a series, a practice referred to as &quot;bicycling.&quot; As such, while &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; aired daily on weekdays, each station airing the show did not air the same episode on a particular day. This prompted producer Gil Fates, who recalled the situation in his book, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?: TV&#x27;s Most Famous Panel Show,&quot; to send a form letter response to fans who had written complaining about the late Bennett Cerf&#x27;s failure to disappear, some saying the television stations were using poor taste.

Fates explained that Cerf indeed had died, but television was practicing a time-honored tradition of celebrating one&#x27;s work long after his death. As he wrote in his book, Fates knew, but did not tell viewers, about the production costs that would have gone to waste had his company acceded to the demands, some coming from station managers, to scrap the Cerf videotapes.

===Revival&#x27;s end and Blyden&#x27;s death===
The syndicated series ran for 1,320 episodes over seven seasons. An attempt at an eighth season did not get off the ground as not enough stations were willing to pick up the series for an additional year. With this in mind, Goodson-Todman offered host Blyden the hosting position on &quot;Showoffs,&quot; a charades-based game show that the company was developing for ABC&#x27;s daytime lineup. He accepted and shot a pilot shortly after &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; ended production. However, Blyden never got to host the series as he was killed in an automobile accident while traveling in Morocco just before taping was to begin. At the time of Blyden&#x27;s death, a handful of new episodes of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; had yet to air in certain markets; by the fall of 1975, the last of these episodes had aired across the United States. Comedian Bobby Van ended up hosting &quot;Showoffs.&quot;

===Later revival attempts===
New versions of &quot;WML&quot; were planned as early as 1981, then in 1996, the show was going to be revived by a joint venture between All-American Television and Miramax Films (which also would have been Miramax&#x27;s first foray into television game shows) as it was being described as &quot;a new model&quot; that would have blended the original features such as having a celebrity panel question contestants in an effort to guess their occupation and also having the panel blindfolded to guess the identity of a famous person, with contemporary &quot;special effects&quot; and &quot;interactive twists.&quot; CBS reportedly committed to air six episodes for its fall 1999 schedule. However, according to Miramax TV president Billy Campbell, the deal crumbled because the network decided the show was too costly and ambitious.

In 2000, a pilot was shot with host Harry Anderson for CBS, but was later turned down in favor of the reality show &quot;Survivor.&quot; This pilot started with three panelists playing the Mystery Guest round; the guest would then be the fourth panelist for the remainder of the episode.

In 2008, another revival of the show with David Hasselhoff was planned in cooperation with FremantleMedia, which had taken over ownership of all Goodson-Todman and Mark Goodson Productions programming, that never got off the ground. In 2014, another pilot for a revival was shot to offer to stations in 2015, but it also failed to sell.

==After &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;==
===25th anniversary special===
In early 1975, with production on break, it became clear to staff that the seventh season of the syndicated &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; would be the last. This was the time of year when production companies and syndicators tried to sell new and continuing series to local stations. Viacom and Goodson-Todman found themselves unable to secure contracts with enough stations to justify continuing to produce the program beyond the episodes that had been videotaped on or prior to December 12, 1974. Just days after disbanding their technical crew, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman pitched the idea of a retrospective network special to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the program&#x27;s CBS debut, called &quot;What&#x27;s My Line at 25&quot;. The programming department at CBS turned down the idea, but ABC bought it. The special eventually was broadcast by ABC on May 28, 1975, on the late-night series &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Entertainment&quot;, and is currently available for viewing at The Paley Center for Media. It made a return twice on basic-cable television as a one-time rerun on GSN (Game Show Network) on December 25, 2014, at 1:00 A.M. EST and as part of Buzzr &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; week on September 29, 2018, at 6:30 P.M. EST.

In producing the special, the only existing master 16 millimeter prints of the original series kinescope films were removed from storage and brought to a Manhattan editing facility that Goodson-Todman Productions rented. There, company employees Gil Fates, Bob Bach, Pamela Usdan and Bill Egan worked round-the-clock for three days to compile the 90-minute special under deadline pressure from ABC network official Bob Shanks. In the process of viewing and editing the films for the special, they accidentally damaged or destroyed several kinescope films that spanned the entire run of the original series, including a few that did not make the final cut of the retrospective. In addition, some unspooled film remained on the floor after the group&#x27;s rented time at the facility ran out. An April 1967 episode featuring Candice Bergen as the mystery guest was lost in its entirety, as was a June 1967 episode featuring both Betty Grable and F. Lee Bailey. Other episodes sustained only partial damage, such as a 1965 episode that is mainly damaged during the mystery guest appearance of Marian Anderson.

Mark Goodson, Arlene Francis and John Charles Daly appeared on-camera in 1975 having a conversation that introduced the old kinescope clips. Hosts of the syndicated version, Wally Bruner and Larry Blyden, were alive at the time but did not participate. With the exception of Bruner&#x27;s 1969 appearance with mystery guest Gerald Ford (presented in black and white), the 25th anniversary special consisted entirely of highlights from the CBS Sunday night version of the series, that viewers likely remembered more fondly than the syndicated version.

===&quot;That&#x27;s My Line&quot;===
In 1980, Mark Goodson began production of &quot;That&#x27;s My Line&quot; which also highlighted the unusual occupations of ordinary people. However, the show was developed as a reality show and had no panel or game elements. &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; announcer Johnny Olson was the announcer, and Bob Barker was the host for the show which ran for two seasons on CBS.

===Live stage version (2004–present)===
From November 2004 to July 2006, Jim Newman and J. Keith van Straaten produced one-hour live stage versions of the show at the ACME Comedy Theatre in Los Angeles, California, titled &quot;What&#x27;s My Line? — Live On Stage&quot;. The Los Angeles version of the live show went on hiatus when van Straaten relocated to New York, then resumed in June 2007.

The production debuted in New York at the Barrow Street Theatre on March 24, 2008, for an announced run of six shows. The show is now an authorized production as it is licensed by FremantleMedia, the owners of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. As of April 12, 2008 the New York mystery guests have been George Wendt, Moby, Natalia Paruz and Tony Roberts. Panelists have included Jonathan Ames, Joy Browne, Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo, Frank DeCaro, Michael Riedel, and original TV version veterans Betsy Palmer and Julia Meade. The first guest on the New York show (#75 in the production overall) was Pat Finch, who was the first guest on the first CBS episode.

In Los Angeles, panelists have included Carlos Alazraqui, Alison Arngrim, E. G. Daily, Andy Dick, Paul Goebel, Danny Goldman, Annabelle Gurwitch, Mariette Hartley, Elaine Hendrix, Marty Ingels, Cathy Ladman, David Lander, Kate Linder, Ann Magnuson, Jayne Meadows, Lee Meriwether, Patt Morrison, Rick Overton, Jimmy Pardo, Lisa Jane Persky, Nancy Pimental, Greg Proops, Mink Stole, Nicole Sullivan, Marcia Wallace, Matt Walsh, Len Wein, Wil Wheaton, Gary Anthony Williams, Debra Wilson, April Winchell, and Andy Zax.

Mystery guests have included Ed Begley Jr., Stephen Bishop, Mr. Blackwell, LeVar Burton, Brett Butler, José Canseco, Drew Carey, Andy Dick, Michael and Kitty Dukakis, Hector Elizondo, Nanette Fabray, Peter Falk, Bruce Jenner, Larry King, Kathy Kinney, Bruno Kirby, Tara Lipinski, Lisa Loeb, Shelley Long, Leonard Maltin, Rose Marie, Wink Martindale, Sally Struthers, Rip Taylor, Judy Tenuta, Alan Thicke, Dick Van Patten, Lindsay Wagner, Wil Wheaton, Noah Wyle, and Sean Young.

Panelists and guests who appeared on the original TV versions and on the stage version include Shelley Berman, Lee Meriwether, radio commentator Michael Jackson, Jayne Meadows, Nanette Fabray, Joanna Barnes, Julie Newmar, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, and Marty Ingels. Usually when such a veteran appears, the audience watches a pristine-quality DVD screening of the original kinescope film on a plasma screen. Non-celebrities include the lifelong Los Angeles-area resident who challenged the panel with her line, afterward reminiscing how 43 years earlier she had traveled to New York, where Arlene Francis identified her as a meter maid. A clip from the kinescope film was played.

In addition, the show has featured relatives of the original cast: Jill Kollmar (daughter of Dorothy Kilgallen and Richard Kollmar), Nina Daly (daughter of John Charles Daly), and Vint Cerf (co-inventor of the Internet and distant cousin of Bennett Cerf). It also included a segment in which Vint Cerf&#x27;s son Bennett (named after the panelist) appeared as a guest.

===Episode availability===
All original series shows were recorded via kinescope onto motion picture film, but networks in the early 1950s sometimes destroyed such recordings to recover the silver content from the film. CBS regularly recycled &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; kinescopes until July 1952, when Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, having realized it was occurring, offered to pay the network for a film of every broadcast. As a result, only about ten episodes exist from the first two years of the series, including the first three broadcasts.

Episode #048 from April 29, 1951, exists at the University of Wisconsin Center For Film and Theater Research.

Episode #013 (August 2, 1950), episode #084 (January 6, 1952), and episode #855 (March 26, 1967) exist at The Paley Center for Media.

An audio-only portion of episode #079 from December 2, 1951 (only has part of Game 1 with Mrs. Virginia Hendershot as the Steam Shovel Operator from Bound Brook, NJ) exists.

A portion of episode #097 (April 6, 1952), the full episode #533 (October 2, 1960), and the full milestone 800th episode (January 23, 1966) exist at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

Only a portion of episode #191 (January 24, 1954) w/Dean Martin &amp; Jerry Lewis as mystery guests exists, and was shown in &quot;What&#x27;s My Line? at 25&quot;.

Episode #195 (February 21, 1954) only exists among collectors as a second-hand kinescope, as the official kinescope is missing from the Goodson-Todman archive.

In 2016, episode #018, aired live on October 1, 1950, was discovered by a film archivist. It was preserved and digitally converted for release.

An audio-only excerpt from the otherwise lost episode #866 (June 18, 1967) can be heard in an LP called &quot;The Age of Television&quot;. This album, which was released by RCA Records in 1971, featured interviews with TV personalities about the medium&#x27;s first 25 years. One of these interviews concerned &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and included audio from the mystery guest segment featuring Betty Grable from that now-lost episode. Lost segments include one in which panelists tried to determine that a contestant was a lawyer. He was F. Lee Bailey.

The existing kinescope films (now digitized) have subsequently been rerun on television. The series has been seen on Game Show Network at various times. The series has also been shown on Buzzr, a digital broadcast television network which is owned and operated by Fremantle.

Some episodes of the CBS radio version of the 1950s are available to visitors to the Paley Center for Media in New York City and Beverly Hills, CA. Others are at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where procedures to access them are more complicated.

Alpha Video released a DVD containing four episodes on February 26, 2008. This is an unofficial release of public domain episodes, and it is unclear if an official release will occur.

A YouTube channel features all surviving 757 episodes of the CBS run of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, plus extras featuring WML regulars, various compilations of clips, and several &quot;lost&quot; episodes that were never included in reruns. Some are off-the-air home recordings of rebroadcasts.

Many, but not all, episodes of the 1968–75 syndicated run were preserved and have been rebroadcast, since the 1990s, on several cable and broadcast networks, notably GSN and Buzzr.

==In popular culture==
* The 1956 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; by Dodie Smith as well as its Disney movie adaptation from 1961 included a parody of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; entitled &quot;What&#x27;s My Crime?&quot; in which panelists had to figure out what a criminal&#x27;s committed crime was. 
* A 1959 episode of &quot;The Art Carney Special&quot; had a parody sketch called &quot;Whats Your Business?&quot;, featuring Art Carney as John Daly, Dick van Dyke as mystery guest Stone Martin, and Betty Garrett as Arlene Francis. 
* Woody Allen parodied &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in his 1972 film &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex,&quot; with the segment &quot;What Are Sex Perverts?&quot; featuring a game show called &quot;What&#x27;s My Perversion?&quot; Appearing as panelists were Robert Q. Lewis, who had been a panelist on the original &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, and Pamela Mason, who had been a mystery guest. Jack Barry, partner of Dan Enright, both of whom had taken falls in the quiz-show scandals of the 1950s, hosted the &quot;What&#x27;s My Perversion?&quot; game show, shortly before both finally returned to television in triumph with &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;.
* In the late 1970s, the comedy show SCTV did a parody titled &quot;What&#x27;s My Shoe Size?&quot;.

<text>The Douglas DC-6 is a piston-powered airliner and cargo aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company from 1946 to 1958. Originally intended as a military transport near the end of World War II, Douglas reworked it after the war to compete with the Lockheed Constellation in the long-range commercial transport market. Douglas built over 700, and many still fly in cargo, military, and wildfire control roles.

The DC-6 was known as the C-118 Liftmaster in United States Air Force service and as the R6D in United States Navy service before 1962, after which all U.S. Navy variants were also designated as the C-118.

==Design and development==

The United States Army Air Forces commissioned the DC-6 project as the XC-112 in 1944. The Army Air Forces wanted a lengthened, pressurized version of the DC-4-based C-54 Skymaster transport with more powerful engines. By the time the prototype XC-112A flew on 15 February 1946, the war was over, the USAAF had rescinded its requirement, and the aircraft was converted to YC-112A, being sold in 1955.

Douglas Aircraft modified the design into a civil transport longer than the DC-4. The civil DC-6 first flew on 29 June 1946, being retained by Douglas for testing. The first airline deliveries were to American Airlines and United Airlines on 24 November 1946. A series of inflight fires (including the fatal crash of United Airlines Flight 608) grounded the DC-6 fleet in 1947. The cause was found to be a fuel vent next to the cabin cooling turbine intake; all DC-6s were modified, and the fleet was flying again after four months on the ground.

==Operational history==

In April 1949, United, American, Delta, National, and Braniff were flying DC-6s in the United States. United flew them to Hawaii, Braniff flew them to Rio de Janeiro, and Panagra flew Miami-Buenos Aires; KLM, SAS, and Sabena flew DC-6s across the Atlantic. BCPA DC-6s flew Sydney to Vancouver, and Philippine flew Manila to London and Manila to San Francisco.

Pan Am used DC-6Bs to start transatlantic tourist-class flights in 1952. These were the first DC-6Bs that could gross , with CB-17 engines rated at on 108/135 octane fuel. Several European airlines followed with transatlantic services. The DC-6B and C subtypes could often fly nonstop from the eastern US to Europe but needed to refuel in Goose Bay, Labrador, or Gander, Newfoundland, when flying westbound into prevailing westerly winds.

Douglas designed four variants of the DC-6: the basic DC-6, and the longer-fuselage () higher-gross-weight, longer-range versions—the DC-6A with cargo doors forward and aft of the wing on the left side, with a cargo floor; the DC-6B for passenger work, with passenger doors only and a lighter floor; and the DC-6C convertible, with the two cargo doors and removable passenger seats.

The DC-6B, originally powered by Double Wasp engines with Hamilton Standard 43E60 constant-speed reversing propellers, was regarded as the ultimate piston-engine airliner from the standpoint of ruggedness, reliability, economical operation, and handling qualities.

Similar to the DC-6A, the military version was the USAF C-118 Liftmaster; the USN R6D version used the more powerful R-2800-CB-17 engines. These were later used on the commercial DC-6B to allow international flights. The R6D Navy version (in the late 1950s and early 1960s) had Curtiss Electric constant-speed reversing propellers.

The USAF and USN renewed their interest in the DC-6 during the Korean War and ordered 167 C-118/R6D aircraft, some of which later found their way to civil airlines. Harry Truman&#x27;s first presidential aircraft was an Air Force short-fuselage DC-6 which was designated VC-118, and named &quot;The Independence&quot;. It is preserved in the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Dayton, Ohio.

Total production of the DC-6 series was 704, including military versions.

In the 1960s two DC-6s were used as transmitter platforms for educational television, based at Purdue University, in a program called the Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction.

Many older DC-6s were replaced in airline passenger service from the mid-1950s by the Douglas DC-7, but the simpler, more economical engines in the DC-6 have meant the type has outlived the DC-7, particularly for cargo operations. DC-6/7s surviving into the jet age were replaced in frontline intercontinental passenger service by the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8.

Basic prices of a new DC-6 in 1946–47 were around £210,000–£230,000 and had risen to £310,000 by 1951. By 1960, used prices were around £175,000 per aircraft. Prices for the DC-6A in 1957–58 were £460,000–£480,000. By 1960, used prices were around £296,000. Equivalent prices for the DC-6B in 1958 were around £500,000. Used prices in 1960 were around £227,000.

From 1977 to 1990, five yellow-painted Douglas DC-6Bs were used as water bombers in France by the Sécurité Civile. They were registered F-ZBAC, F-ZBAD, F-ZBAE, F-ZBAP, and F-ZBBU.

==Operators==


=== Current operators ===
Today, most DC-6s are inactive, stored, or preserved in museums. Several DC-6s fly in northern bush operations in Alaska, while several are based in Europe, and a few are still in operation for small carriers in South America.
* One DC-6A, G-APSA, is based in the UK and available for private charter. It was painted in British Eagle colours and appeared at many air displays. The aircraft was disassembled in 2018. It had been grounded at Coventry for some time due to wing spar issues, which proved beyond economic repair. The parts of the airframe were taken to the South Wales Aviation Museum in the spring of 2021, where it will be restored and reassembled to go on display. Another DC-6B (G-SIXC ex-Air Atlantique) was converted to a restaurant some years ago but was reported to have closed in 2017. It was also moved to St Athan with G-APSA, but was advertised for sale in August 2021.
* One DC-6B is in use by the Flying Bulls Aerobatics Team in Salzburg, Austria.
* One DC-6B V5-NCG &quot;Bateleur&quot; was in use with Namibia Commercial Aviation. It was stored and derelict in Windhoek by Jan 2017.
* As of July 2016, Everts Air Cargo in Alaska operates eleven DC-6s and two C-46s, with several more in storage. Their sister company Everts Air Fuel operates three DC-6 and two C-46.

=== Former operators ===
Many airlines and air forces from several countries included the DC-6 in their fleets at some point in time; these are further detailed in the list of Douglas DC-6 operators.
In the 1980s, several DC-6Bs were used as fire retardant tankers by Conair Aerial Firefighting of Abbotsford, Canada. Douglas sold the last aircraft to Everts Air Cargo in Fairbanks, AK, in the late 2000s.

==Accidents and incidents==
==Surviving aircraft==
, 147 DC-6s survived, of which 47 were airworthy; several were preserved in museums.

==Post 1960s dairy consolidation==
Dairy products have long formed the backbone of Ireland&#x27;s agricultural sector, and by the early 19th century the country was amongst the world&#x27;s largest producers. In 1848, Ireland accounted for two thirds of butter imports into the port of London. Irish butter came under pressure by competitors modernising their systems with newly developed cream separators. As a consequence, Irish butter exports to London dramatically fell in the early 1880s.

The new technologies fundamentally transformed the country&#x27;s dairy sector, which had been operated by independent farmers. In order to support the cost of new equipment, dairy farmers grouped together to build centralised processing facilities – known as &#x27;creameries&#x27;. In the late 1880s, farmers adopted the cooperative format, often to enter into direct competition with the private creameries. Farmers who supplied milk to the co-ops were better served than those who sold it to the private creameries. In time, most of those businesses found that they were unable to compete with the farmer co-operatives, and many sold their premises and businesses to the co-ops.

The numbers of creameries increased substantially by 1900, and by the eve of World War I, the country counted nearly 800 plants. In spite of the scarcities, political unrest and violent incidents, the World War I era had been a prosperous period for farmers. The crisis in the country&#x27;s agricultural market following the war led to a large number of creameries to shut down.

Government policy in the 1920s further consolidated the dairy market. The number of creameries was reduced to 17 large-scale facilities in the years following World War II. At the same time, the number of cooperatives in Ireland had shrunk back to fewer than 220. Butter remained the Irish dairy industry&#x27;s core product, accounting for the majority of the creameries&#x27; production.

The members of five co-operatives agreed to join forces and become Waterford Co-operative Society Limited in 1964. The formation of Waterford Co-operative in 1964 was the first of the major amalgamations and it was the beginning of a story that would be repeated throughout Ireland over the next 40 years. The size of the co-operative gave them the opportunity to produce a bigger range of products. With its head start, Waterford was able to grow and a decade later, in 1974, this scale of operation would help in winning the French Yoplait franchise to produce the prestige range of yogurts at Inch, County Wexford – an association that continues to this day. Waterford continued growing throughout the 1970s, amalgamating with a number of other, smaller creameries.

In the meantime, 25 other cooperatives agreed to merge to establish the Avonmore Creameries Federation by 1966. The Ballyhale C.D.S. 100 year anniversary booklet records that a federation of 25 Co-op Creameries originally emerged in January 1965 under the umbrella of Avonmore Creameries Ltd., that shares were taken in the new entity by the society and that in following years a Ballyragget milk processing factory was built. Ireland entered the Common Market in 1970. The first bulk milk collections took place from 1973, when the amalgamation was formalised. Ballyhale C.D.S. became one of 20 members of Avonmore Farmers Ltd.; the other founding members being Castlehale, Mullinavat, Iverk, Piltown, Carrigeen, Kilmacow, Ballyragget, South Tipperary, Monastarevan, Muckalee, Barrowvale, Kells, Windgap, Brandonvale, Bennetsbridge, Castlecomer, Freshford, Donaghmore and Fennor. According to Glanbia Collections in Kilkenny Archives at St Kieran&#x27;s College, Kilkenny, the Avonmore Coop brand was created through the merger of the Village Creameries that are included among their archives for:

*Ballingarry Co-Operative Creamery Ltd.
*Ballyhale Co-Operative Creamery Dairy Society Ltd.
*Ballypatrick Co-Operative Creamery Ltd.

Backed by the British dairy giant Unigate, the new federation began the construction of a new multi-purpose dairy plant in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny. The plant was the biggest processing facility in Europe at that time. Today, the Ballyragget facility is the largest integrated dairy site in Europe, processing about 20% of the Irish milk pool. Avonmore originally focused on the production of butter and powdered skim milk. On 1 September 1973, 20 societies amalgamated, thus creating Avonmore Farmers Ltd. As time moved on, Unigate&#x27;s involvement changed and, in 1978, the cooperative bought back Unigate&#x27;s stake in the Ballyragget facility.

==International 1980s expansion==
Both Avonmore and Waterford expanded into the 1980s. At home, both companies established brand names, while Waterford continued with its Yoplait franchise. The two co-operatives continued to add product lines. Avonmore, for example, launched Avonmore Fresh Milk on the Dublin market on 1 June 1981. The two companies, Avonmore and Waterford, went public in the 1980s. Avonmore went first, becoming Avonmore Foods plc on 6 September 1988. Waterford Foods plc was launched on the Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) on 6 October 1988. Both groups remained majority controlled by the dairy farmers that had formed the original co-operatives. With new access to capital, both companies embarked on a programme of expansion.

Avonmore&#x27;s strategy included growing the dairy business in the UK and US. They also decided to grow the business through acquisition. Over the next nine years they made 28 acquisitions in Ireland, the UK, the US, Hungary, Germany and Belgium. The major developments were in the UK with liquid milk and mozzarella cheese and in the US with cheese production in Wisconsin, Illinois and Idaho. In the years following flotation, Avonmore also invested in the meat business in Ireland.

In 1989, a year after the establishment of Waterford Foods plc, the Group bought Galloway West in the US heartland dairying state of Wisconsin. The company manufactured cheese, condensed milk and food ingredients. Later in the year, Waterford bought A.Heald Limited of Manchester, a company that operated in the liquid milk and fruit juice business. Waterford also expanded in Ireland with the move into the prized Dublin milk market. In 1995, Waterford bought The Cheese Company, one of the two largest cheese manufacturers in Great Britain. Both organisations were focused on similar growth strategies at home and overseas. Speculation was, therefore, rife as to a possible merger between the two dairy giants. The talks began and ended without agreement in 1991.

==Merger with Waterford==
Waterford&#x27;s expansion came at a cost, and the group struggled to maintain profitability in the mid-1990s. By 1997, after Waterford posted a profit warning, the group again found itself in merger talks with Avonmore. On 13 April 1997, Waterford confirmed that it had received a formal approach from Avonmore and advised that the Waterford Board was considering the approach. The prize for a successful merger would be significant: an Irish-based, world-scale food company. This proposed coming together would represent the biggest amalgamation in the history of the Irish dairy industry and possibly of Irish agribusiness.

Intensive dialogue took place between Avonmore and Waterford throughout April and May 1997. On 26 May, the Boards of Waterford Foods plc and Waterford Co-operative Society met to consider amended proposals from Avonmore Foods plc and Avonmore Creameries Ltd. The merger proposals provoked serious debates at numerous shareholder meetings throughout Waterford and Avonmore. Some shareholders had strong reservations and among their concerns were issues such as perceived loss of identity, dominance by one party over another, relative valuations of the two organisations, size and scale of the new entity, representation and weakening of farmer control. The majority of shareholders believed the merger was the right option for both organisations.

The first vote took place on 11 July 1997, exactly three months after the merger was formally proposed. The first vote followed an intensive six-week programme of shareholder information meeting throughout the Waterford and Avonmore areas. The successful merger of Avonmore Creameries Limited and Waterford Co-operatives Society, on 4 September 1997, formed the new Avonmore Waterford Co-operative Society. On the same date, the merger of Avonmore Foods plc and Waterford Foods plc, formed the new Avonmore Waterford Group (AWG) plc.

==1990s reorganisation==
The 1997 merger created the fourth biggest dairy processor in Europe and the fourth biggest cheese producer in the world. The Avonmore Waterford Group announced a reorganisation programme to increase their competitiveness. The strategy was to concentrate food ingredients activities in large-scale facilities in Ireland and the US. The US development strategy focused on the Avonmore West operation in Idaho which benefited from scale, location, and a growing milk supply. Following the US$20 million investment programme, Avonmore West became a global supplier of advanced dairy food and nutritional ingredients. As a result, the company disposed of its smaller cheese business in Wisconsin.

In Ireland, food ingredients activities were to be located mainly at Ballyragget and Virginia. Within the consumer food business, liquid milk operations were to be located at Ballytore, Waterford, and Drogheda. These decisions resulted in the closure of smaller facilities.

In the UK, the Group closed its Appleby cheese facility and also disposed of the Manchester-based juice business during 1997. The cost-saving measures targeted to save £20 million in 1998 and £40 million in 1999. It was anticipated that the programme would reduce jobs in AWG from 11,900 to 10,600. Job losses would be 750 in Ireland and 550 in the UK.

By May 1999, the reorganisation programme, announced in November 1997, was virtually complete. The Ballyragget site had been enhanced to accommodate the additional milk volumes. In the US, the Group was investing US$36 million in Idaho to increase cheese production by 30 percent and dairy-based food ingredients production by 22 percent. On 1 June 1999, the Group announced two important strategic sales. The first was the disposal of the UK liquid milk operations to Express Dairies, for £125 million. The second was the sale of its Irish beef processing operations to Dawn Meats for £10 million.

==New corporate identity==
On 15 February 1999, an Extraordinary General Meeting and Special General Meeting were held to seek the necessary approval for the introduction of a new name. The change of title from Avonmore Waterford Group to Glanbia became official on 4 March 1999. The name Glanbia has its roots in the Irish language – Glanbia means &quot;pure food&quot; in Irish.

On 11 August 2000, Glanbia announced a joint venture with Leprino Foods. Leprino was the world&#x27;s largest producer of mozzarella cheese. As part of the joint venture, Leprino Foods took a 49 per cent interest in Glanbia Cheese UK and granted exclusive use of Leprino&#x27;s patented technology to Glanbia.

International joint ventures became a key element of the group&#x27;s growth strategy. Consequently, in October 2003, Glanbia and PZ Cussons plc announced a €20 million joint venture to build a new factory in Nigeria to supply evaporated milk and milk powders to the Nigerian market. The name selected for the new joint venture company was Nutricima. Glanbia entered into yet another joint venture, this time with the Great Southwest Agency in New Mexico, US. Building commenced at Southwest Cheese in January 2004 and the official opening of Southwest Cheese took place in 2006.

Glanbia continued to refine its focus, targeting the new and fast-growing &#x27;nutritional&#x27; foods segment. In 2003, the company announced its intention to exit the fresh meat market which was subsequently sold in a management buy-out in 2008.
==Nutritional foods==
After establishing a nutritionals business in January 2003, Glanbia acquired the German-based Kortus Food Ingredients Services (KFIS) in 2004. KFIS specialises in the production, research, and development of micronutrient premixes. The purchase increased Glanbia&#x27;s product range and brought further access to markets in Germany and Central Europe. On 6 September 2006, Glanbia announced the acquisition of the California-based micronutrient premix business, Seltzer Companies Inc. The acquisition of Seltzer was a logical addition to the previously acquired KFIS. Both businesses have since changed their names to Glanbia Nutritionals. In 2007, Glanbia further expanded their micronutrient premix business with the completion of a new premix plant in Suzhou, China.

As part of its international expansion, Glanbia acquired the Canadian nutritionals business Pizzey&#x27;s Milling in August 2007. Pizzey&#x27;s, which mills flaxseed, created a way into the North American omega-3 market.

Glanbia again expanded its presence in the North American market in 2008 through its acquisition of the Illinois-based sports supplement firm Optimum Nutrition. Optimum has a strong presence in the US market for whey-based premium sports supplements. In January 2011, Glanbia announced the acquisition of Bio-Engineered Supplements and Nutrition (BSN), extending their sports nutrition portfolio. BSN is a developer and distributor of nutritional products designed for health, training, physique development and performance.

==Proposed Irish dairy division sale to farmers==
In April 2010 Glanbia plc announced plans to sell its Irish dairy and agri-business division to the Glanbia Co-Operative Society. The farmer-led co-op owns 54.6% of the company. The Irish dairy and agri-business includes brands such as Kilmeaden, Avonmore and Yoplait. The deal was aimed at freeing up Glanbia plc to pursue its global cheese and nutritional ambitions, but it failed to achieve the necessary three-quarters approval from the co-op&#x27;s members on 10 May, falling just short at 73%.

On 25 November 2012 Glanbia disposed of 60% of its Irish dairy processing business to Glanbia Co-Operative Society Limited (the &quot;Society&quot;). As a result, the Irish dairy processing business, now called Glanbia Ingredients Ireland Limited (&quot;GIIL&quot;)became an associate of Glanbia plc.

==Growth==

2014 – Glanbia acquires Danish sports nutrition company Nutramino for up to €20 million. 

2014 – Glanbia acquires US sports nutrition specialist Isopure for $153m (€118m). 

2015 – Glanbia completes $217m acquisition of US protein bar specialist thinkThin. The company was founded in 1999 and is based in Southern California. 

2017 – Glanbia invests in two new acquisitions: US-based Amazing Grass and Dutch company Body &amp; Fit. Amazing Grass specializes in plant-based nutrition, &quot;Greens,&quot; and superfood categories. Body &amp; Fit is a direct-to-consumer distribution company focused on own-label and branded sports nutrition in the Benelux region. 

October 2018 – Glanbia acquires the weight-management brand SlimFast and adds the ingredient manufacturer Watson to their portfolio. 
 

2020: Glanbia completed the construction of a world-class mozzarella plant in Ireland in partnership with Leprino Foods and a $470m state-of-the-art cheese and whey protein manufacturing facility in Michigan. In the same year, Glanbia acquired Foodarom, a Canadian-based custom flavor designer and manufacturer, for $45 million (€38 million).

2021 – Glanbia acquires PacMoore, enhancing their healthy snack capability, and expands into e-sports by adding LevlUp to their brand portfolio. 

2022 – Acquisition of Sterling Technology. 

2023 – Acquisition of Flavor Producers for $355 million. 
==Glanbia Ireland==

On 18 May 2017, Glanbia Co-operative Society shareholders attended a Special General Meeting at the Punchestown Event Centre to vote on the creation of Glanbia Ireland, a joint venture between Glanbia Co-operative Society Limited (60%) and Glanbia plc (40%), combining Glanbia Consumer Products, Agribusiness, and Glanbia Ingredients Ireland. The proposal was approved by 93.1% of Glanbia Co-op shareholders. The creation of Glanbia Ireland was also approved by Glanbia plc&#x27;s independent shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 22 May 2017. 
 

In April 2022, Glanbia plc announced that it had completed the sale of its 40% holding in Glanbia Ireland to Glanbia Co-operative Society Limited. 

In September 2022, Glanbia Ireland changed its name to Tirlán Co-operative Society Limited. 

==Segments==
The company comprises:

*Glanbia Nutritionals

*Glanbia Performance Nutrition
* Joint Ventures

==Acquisition of Aroma Holding Company==
In April 2024, Glanbia announced to acquire Aroma Holding Company, a US flavouring business for $300m (€281 million) plus deferred consideration of up to $55 million, dependent on performance in 2024. On 28 February 2024, the company also announced €100 million buyback programme which was unaffected by this agreement. Glanbia declared to operate Flavor Producers within its Glanbia Nutritionals.

== Sponsorship ==
In March 2023, Optimum Nutrition became the Official Performance Nutrition Partner of the Gaelic Players Association in a three-year partnership.

In September 2023, Glanbia became the lead sponsor of the Kilkenny Camogie Team. Glanbia will sponsor the county&#x27;s senior, intermediate, minor and under-16 camogie teams over the next three years as part of the deal, with team jerseys and leisurewear carrying the Glanbia brand.

In February 2024, McLaren Racing announced Optimum Nutrition as the Official Sports Nutrition Partner of the team. Optimum Nutrition&#x27;s branding will be prominently featured on the pit crew overalls and set-up kit, and the driver overalls.

<doc id="494213" wikidata="Q534134" url="?curid=494213" title="Tumbuka people">
<text>The Tumbuka (or, Kamanga, Batumbuka and Matumbuka) are a Bantu ethnic group found in Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania. Tumbuka is classified as a part of the Bantu language family, and with origins in a geographic region between the Dwangwa River to the south, the North Rukuru River to the north, Lake Malawi to the east, and the Luangwa River. They are found in the valleys near the rivers, lake as well as the highlands of Nyika Plateau, where they are frequently referred to as Henga although this is strictly speaking the name of a subdivision.

Historically, the Tumbuka can be subdivided 
into two groups: the Tumbuka of Luba, who are the original group from Luba Kingdom, and the Tumbuka who emerged through intermarriages with non-Tumbuka neighbours. The neighbours came to settle in the Tumbuka territory long after the Tumbuka formed their kingdom. These are Tumbuka Chewa, Tumbuka Senga, Tumbuka Mlowoka, 
and Tumbuka Ngoni. In reality and culturally they are all Tumbuka. There are also many smaller subsidiary Tumbuka groups by origin found mainly in the north-western corner of their original kingdom between Kalonga and Isoka. Many of these belong to the Kalonga wa Nkhonde segment of the Mulonga Mbulalubilo Tumbuka.

To set record straight, the Tumbuka tribe was one of the first tribes who originated from Luba in what is currently known as Democratic Republic of the Congo. That was before any formal government setup and they had been staying there for hundreds of years after breaking away from the Bantu tribes in upper central Africa.

The Tumbuka tribe and other small tribes were driven out of Luba by a warrior tribe known as Kongolo. He merged with the tribes that remained in Luba after they tried to subdue the Tumbuka people and failed.

==Demography and language==
Various estimates suggest that over ten million Tumbuka speakers live in north Malawi, northeast Zambia and Tanzania. Ethnologue estimated a total of 10,346,000 Tumbuka speakers in 2022. However, Ember et al. estimate that about an additional million Tumbuka people live in central and southern African countries such as Tanzania because of the diffusion of Tumbuka people as migrant labor.

The Tumbuka language, also called &quot;chiTumbuka&quot;, is a Bantu language, similar to many other Bantu languages in structure and vocabulary. It is classified as a central Bantu language in the Niger-Congo family, and it has many dialects. The Tumbuka are collectively known as ŵaTumbuka and one is called &quot;mutumbuka&quot; meaning one of the Tumbuka tribe. The Tumbuka language is closely related to the Tonga language and it has been suggested that they originally formed a single group of mutually intelligible dialects until different missionaries treated two such dialects as the standard Tumbuka and Tonga languages.

Before a British protectorate was created over Nyasaland, there were many ethnic groups in what is now Malawi&#x27;s Northern Region including a substantial group culturally-related people, scattered widely and loosely organized under largely autonomous village headmen who spoke dialects of the Tumbuka language. Missionaries in the late 19th century standardised these languages into a relatively small number of groups, and chose the standardised Tumbuka language as the usual medium for teaching in the north of the country, in preference to the Ngoni, Tonga or Ngonde languages which were also prominent in the area. By the start of the 20th century, the Ngoni and Ngonde languages were in decline, although Tonga was more resilient.

In 1968, Tumbuka was abolished as an official language, as a medium of instruction and in examinations, and the secondary school entrance system was manipulated to assist candidates from the Central Region and disadvantage those from the Northern Region. Some of those that objected to the ban on the use of Tumbuka were arrested or harassed but both the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian and the Catholic Church continued to preach and use religious texts in Tumbuka in the Northern Region.

After the advent of multi-party democracy, Tumbuka language programmes began to be broadcast on national radio in 1994 but a 1996 proposal for the reintroduced of Tumbuka as a medium for teaching in the first four years of compulsory education has not been fully implemented. One effect of the failure to restore the Tumbuka language as the standard language of the Northern Region is that speakers of other languages in the region, the Tonga, Ngonde and even the little-spoken Ngoni language are now seeking parity with Tumbuka.

==History==
The Tumbuka probably entered the area between the Luangwa valley and northern Lake Malawi in the 15th century. At the start of the 18th century, they formed a number of groups, of which the Henga was one, living in small, independent communities without a central organisation, spread thinly over this area. By the mid-18th century, traders dressed “as Arabs”, although coming from the Unyamwezi region of what is now Tanzania were involved in trading for ivory and to some extent slaves as far inland as the Luangwa valley. They formed alliances with groups of Henga, and their leader established the Chikulamayembe Dynasty ruling a federation of small chiefdoms. However, by the 1830s, this Chikulamayembe dynasty was in decline and the area reverted to a state of political and military disorganisation

The large elephant herds of the region attracted groups of coastal Swahili ivory hunters and traders followed in the colonial era by European ivory traders. In the 1840s, Swahili Arabs entered northern Malawi region, with Jumbe Salim bin Abdallah establishing a trading centre at Nkhotakota near Lake Malawi. Jumbe Abdallah&#x27;s trade in slaves to satisfy the demand for slaves on Zanzibar plantations of cloves and for the Middle East triggered raids and violence against the Tumbuka people. A male slave was known as &quot;muzga&quot; or &quot;kapolo&quot;, while a &quot;chituntulu&quot; meant a young female slave.

 The rising demand for ivory in the European market led to conflicts to control the export trade, resulting in greater social distinctions and politically centralized chiefdoms among the Tumbuka. These ruling groups collapsed around 1855, when the highly militarized warriors of the Ngoni ethnic group from South Africa arrived seeking agricultural slaves and recruits, in addition to those acquired by the Swahili traders.

The Ngoni of Mbelwa (also known as M&#x27;mbelwa) were a branch of Zwangendaba&#x27;s Ngoni, which began its migration from South Africa between 1819 and 1822, eventually reaching southern Tanzania and remained there until Zwangendaba&#x27;s death in the mid-1840s. After this, his followers split into several groups, one of which under his son Mbelwa settled permanently in what is now the Mzimba district of northern Malawi around 1855. Mbelwa&#x27;s Ngoni treated the Henga as subjects, exacting tribute and taking captives through raiding. These captives were rarely sold to the Swahili traders, but retained as unfree agricultural workers or enrolled in Ngoni regiments. Some of these Henga conscript soldiers revolted and fled north, entering Ngonde territory around 1881, where the Ngonde settled them as a buffer against their enemies.

The Swahili traders had built most of their stockades in the area in which the Henga had been settled and, after the African Lakes Company set up a trading base at Karonga, and as the threat of Ngoni raids had declined, the usefulness of Henga and Swahili to the Ngonde state lessened. Both groups were aliens among the Ngonde majority, and were suspicious of cooperation between the company and Ngonde, so they allied with each other. The alliance of the Swahili and the Henga faced a rival alliance between the Ngonde and the African Lakes Company which eventually led to the so-called Karonga War between them, a series of skirmishes and sieges of stockades between 1887 and 1889

The Ngoni invasion led initially to a devastation of the Tumbuka people, through the death, destruction, loss of family members, abandonment of the settled valleys, and disruption of their traditional agricultural methods as the Tumbuka people hid in mountains, small islands, and marshes to escape from the violence associated with large-scale human raids and elephant hunting. It also led to intermingling and intermarriage between the people of Tumbuka and the Ngoni cultures.

The British explorer David Livingstone wrote about the Lake Malawi region in 1858, mentioning slavery of the Tumbuka people both to the export of slaves to satisfy the Arab demand as well as domestic slavery in the form of &quot;debt settlement&quot;. Christian missionaries arrived in this region in the 1870s.

In 1895 British-led forces defeated the slave trader Mlozi at Karonga, ending the slave trade there. Although a British protectorate over what is now Malawi was proclaimed in 1891, the Northern Ngoni only finally accepted British rule in 1904, when the Tumbuka people ceased to be their vassals or returned from where they had taken refuge to their original homes. A Chikulamayembe paramount chief was restored to office in 1907, and Tumbuka culture reasserted itself. The education provided by Scottish-run missions at several sites in the Northern Region of Nyasaland was more eagerly embraced by the Tumbuka and Tonga peoples, whose earlier social organisation and religion had suffered from the attacks of slave raiders and Ngoni, than by the Ngoni and Ngonde peoples, who retained these institutions intact, and more mission schools were opened among the Tumbuka than any other group in Nyasaland. The education that these schools provided not only reached a greater numbers of pupils but was also superior to that found in other parts of the protectorate, although other Scottish missionaries at Blantyre Mission also provided educational advancement for some southerners. Those that these missions trained became an educated African elite, who found employment as teachers, in the colonial civil service or in commerce, and whose political aim was African advancement to higher positions in the administration. In contrast, the Yao people in the south, who included many Muslims excluded from Christian education, and Chewa people in the centre, where fewer missions had been founded, were less affected by these political aspirations.

In the pre-colonial period, the Tumbuka people, like most of the people of what became Nyasaland relied on subsistence farming to support their families. During the first three decades of colonial rule, commercial agriculture developed both on European-owned states and the smallholdings of African peasants in the southern and central parts of the protectorate. However, attempts to introduce commercial agriculture into the Northern Region were frustrated by a lack of suitable crops and high transport costs arising from its distance from the available markets. As early as the 1880s, Tumbuka and Tonga men began to leave the region to work as porters and estate workers in the Southern Region of Nyasaland and, once those Tumbuka that had received a mission education reached adulthood, they travelled to Southern Rhodesia and South Africa where their literacy and numeracy commanded much high wages than they could earn in within Nyasaland. Although the colonial government was concerned about the scale of labour migration, it was a virtual necessity for many in the north of the country where there were few alternatives besides subsistence agriculture. 
The colonial government were concerned that the Tumbuka-speaking areas had become the &quot;Dead North&quot; of the country but only invested small amounts in developing infrastructure or promoting commercial crops

One supporter of the underdevelopment hypothesis blames the impoverishment and stagnation of Tumbuka-speaking areas on a step-by-step process that started in the middle of the 19th century when the Indian Ocean ivory and slave trade created a demand for imported goods and prompted social differentiation within their traditional societies. This was worsened by the mid-19th century incursion of Ngoni people, which caused a further loss of status of among the Tumbuka people, who become Ngoni serfs or refugees with limited access to land. Ngoni agricultural practices of shifting or slash-and-burn cultivation and overstocking cattle were said to impoverish the soil and promoted the spread of the tsetse fly. According to Vail, the effect of the Ngoni invasions was exacerbated during the period of colonial rule up to 1939 as, at best, local African men in the &quot;Dead North&quot; of Nyasaland had little choice but to become labour migrants and, at worst, their recruitment for the mines, farms and other employers of Southern Rhodesia and South Africa was forced.

Much of Vail&#x27;s account of environmental degradation in Northern Nyasaland is based on the views of 19th century missionaries who regarded Ngoni farming practices as environmentally destructive, wasteful and therefore morally wrong, although modern agronomists believe shifting cultivation may be efficient and sympathetic to the environment. His suggestions that both the recruitment of labour and the consumption of foreign goods was forced on the Tumbuka, seem overstated, and the first labour migrancy from this area was entirely voluntary and, in later years, was more often disapproved of by the Nyasaland government than promoted by them. 
Since independence, the economic conditions of the Tumbuka people have remained largely unchanged, their political power limited given the numerous ethnic groups in this region of Africa.

Levi Mumba, Charles Chinula and many of the leading figures in organisations that later became part of Nyasaland African Congress, or of Congress itself, were Tumbuka-speaking northerners or graduates of Blantyre Mission. This movement ultimately gained independence for Malawi in 1964.

After in 1963, in preparation for independence, Tumbuka speakers took a majority of the ministerial posts in the government of Hastings Banda. Shortly after independence, in the 1964 Cabinet Crisis, the demands of these ministers for more rapid Africanisation, a key demand of the mission-educated elite, led to their resignation or sacking and in many cases their exile. In the aftermath of this, Banda purged their supporters and other Tumbuka speakers from positions of influence and replaced them with Chewa nominees from the Central Region, at the same time promoting the Chewa culture as the only authentic Malawian culture.

==Society, religion and culture==

Even before colonial rule was established, Christian missionaries arrived amongst Tumbuka people. Thomas Cullen Young was one of the first missionaries to publish on the culture in &quot;Notes on the history of the Tumbuka-Kamanga peoples in the Northern Province of Nyasaland.&quot; To help the conversion process, hymnbook and mythologies of Christianity were written into Tumbuka language, into a Tumbuka hymnbook. In contemporary times, the Tumbuka people are officially Christian, but they retain their traditional beliefs and folklores.

The Tumbuka people have had a sophisticated traditional religion. It included the concept of a supreme creator called &quot;Chiuta&quot; symbolizing the sun, who Tumbuka faith holds was &quot;self created and all knowing&quot;. This religious belief has yield a rich mythology filled with morals. In a manner similar to neighboring regions of Africa, the Tumbuka have also revered ancestor worship, spirit possession, witchcraft and similar practices. Their spirit possession and witchcraft is related to folk therapies for illnesses. This practice is locally called &quot;Vimbuza&quot;, includes a therapeutic dance performed by those possessed, and this is a part of modern syncretistic Christianity observed by the Tumbuka people.

The Tumbuka people have been rural, living in villages or dispersed agnatically related clusters of rectangular thatched houses. A circular thatched granaries and kitchen would traditionally be a part of each household. The male members would spend their time mostly in a part of the house called &quot;Mpara&quot; and females in &quot;Ntanganini&quot;. In the crop season, family members dispersed, sometimes residing in isolated thatched houses near the cultivated land.

In the contemporary era, the primary staple crops of the Tumbuka people are maize, cassava, millet, and beans, along with a variety of pumpkins, vegetables, and fruits such as bananas and oranges as supplements often grown by Tumbuka women. Men have tended to be migrant workers. In the past, the farming was done manually using hoes. During the colonial rule, ox-drawn plows were introduced. &quot;Citemene&quot;, or slash and burn agriculture by small farmers is a modern era practice and continues among the Tumbuka people.

== Vimbuza ==
&quot;Vimbuza&quot; (pl. of Chimbuza) is a term used among the Tumbuka-speaking peoples of northern Malawi and eastern Zambia to describe several classes of possessive spirits, the embodied states of illness they produce in a person, and the therapeutic drumming, music, dance, and ritual that is performed to remedy the symptoms. As a cultural practice, Vimbuza is a local version of a more widespread therapeutic complex known as ngoma, which is found throughout much of central and southern Africa and has been the focus of important scholarship by John M. Janzen and others, and even earlier by Victor Turner in his writings about Ndembu &quot;drums of affliction&quot;.

&quot;Vimbuza&quot;, in the traditional Tumbuka people&#x27;s belief, are category of spirits that cause illnesses, a concept that according to James Peoples and Garrick Bailey is similar to &quot;bodily humours&quot; in early European texts. The &quot;Vimbuza&quot; causes imbalance in the hot and cold forces within the human body, whose healing process, to Tumbuka people, is a ritual dance with singing and music. The UNESCO inscribed the ritualistic &quot;Vimbuza&quot; dance as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008. The musical instruments that accompany the &quot;Vimbuza&quot; includes a Ng’oma or “drums of affliction”. A healer diagnoses spirit possession, and with the patient undertakes dance healing ritual treatment over several weeks or months.The dance tries to bring the patient into a trance, while the songs call the spirits to help. Men participate by creating drum rhythms that are spirit-specific and sometimes as the healer. &quot;Vimbuza&quot;, states UNESCO, creates a &quot;space for patients to dance their disease”.

The Vimbuza tradition is effectively a set of practices and beliefs of which the Vimbuza dance is part; is a traditional healing procedure, to cure psychological illnesses as well as exorcise demons. In some places it is specifically called mkhalachitatu Vimbuza. Mkhalachitatu Vimbuza is one of the names given to Vimbuza dances performed as an exorcism rite when one is possessed by demons or evil spirits.

It is predominantly performed in Rumphi, but has spread to Mzimba, Karonga, Kasungu and other districts. The dance is also performed in Nkhata Bay where it is called &quot;masyabi&quot; and here it incorporates indigenous variations.

== Zengani Traditional Ceremony ==
 Zengani Traditional Ceremony is a traditional annual event held for Tumbuka speakers of Lundazi, Chasefu and Lumezi District in Eastern Province of Zambia, typically in October. &quot;Zengani&quot; means &quot;bringing together two tribes&quot; of the Ngoni and Tumbuka speaking people. During the ceremony people are expected to be entertained to various traditional dances like ingoma, vimbuza, muganda, and chiwoda. Traditional leaders such as chiefs attend the events.

<doc id="494253" wikidata="Q552087" url="?curid=494253" title="Adenoid">
<text>In anatomy, the pharyngeal tonsil, also known as the nasopharyngeal tonsil or adenoid, is the superior-most of the tonsils. It is a mass of lymphoid tissue located behind the nasal cavity, in the roof and the posterior wall of the nasopharynx, where the nose blends into the throat. In children, it normally forms a soft mound in the roof and back wall of the nasopharynx, just above and behind the uvula.

The term &quot;adenoid&quot; is also used to represent adenoid hypertrophy, the abnormal growth of the pharyngeal tonsils.

==Structure==
The adenoid is a mass of lymphoid tissue located behind the nasal cavity, in the roof and the posterior wall of the nasopharynx, where the nose blends into the throat. The adenoid, unlike the palatine tonsils, has pseudostratified epithelium. The adenoids are part of the so-called Waldeyer ring of lymphoid tissue which also includes the palatine tonsils, the lingual tonsils and the tubal tonsils.

=== Development ===
Adenoids develop from a subepithelial infiltration of lymphocytes after the 16th week of embryonic life. After birth, enlargement begins and continues until ages 5 to 7 years.

=== Function ===
Part of the immune system, adenoids trap and recognize pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. In response, the adenoid produces T cells and B cells to combat infection, contributing to the synthesis of IgA immunoglobulins, assisting in the body&#x27;s immunologic memory.

=== Microbiome ===
Species of bacteria such as lactobacilli, anaerobic streptococci, actinomycosis, Fusobacterium species, and Nocardia are normally present by 6 months of age. Normal flora found in the adenoid consists of alpha-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci, Corynebacterium species, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Neisseria species, Haemophilus species, Micrococcus species, and Stomatococcus species.

==Clinical significance==

=== Enlargement ===
An enlarged adenoid, or adenoid hypertrophy, can become nearly the size of a ping pong ball and completely block airflow through the nasal passages. Even if the enlarged adenoid is not substantial enough to physically block the back of the nose, it can obstruct airflow enough so that breathing through the nose requires an uncomfortable amount of work, and inhalation occurs instead through an open mouth. The enlarged adenoid would also obstruct the nasal airway enough to affect the voice without actually stopping nasal airflow altogether.

Symptomatic enlargement between 18 and 24 months of age is not uncommon, meaning that snoring, nasal airway obstruction and obstructed breathing may occur during sleep. However, this may be reasonably expected to decline when children reach school age, and progressive shrinkage may be expected thereafter.

===Adenoid facies===
Enlargement of the adenoid, especially in children, causes an atypical appearance of the face, often referred to as &quot;adenoid facies&quot;. Features of adenoid facies include mouth breathing, an elongated face, prominent incisors, hypoplastic maxilla, short upper lip, elevated nostrils, and a high arched palate.

===Removal ===
Surgical removal of the adenoid is a procedure called adenoidectomy. Adenoid infection may cause symptoms such as excessive mucus production, which can be treated by its removal. Studies have shown that adenoid regrowth occurs in as many as 19% of the cases after removal. Carried out through the mouth under a general anaesthetic (or less commonly a topical), adenoidectomy involves the adenoid being curetted, cauterized, lasered, or otherwise ablated. The adenoid is often removed along with the palatine tonsils.

<text>Adenoidectomy is the surgical removal of the adenoid for reasons which include impaired breathing through the nose, chronic infections, or recurrent earaches. The effectiveness of removing the adenoids in children to improve recurrent nasal symptoms and/or nasal obstruction has not been well studied. The surgery is less commonly performed in adults in whom the adenoid is much smaller and less active than it is in children. It is most often done on an outpatient basis under general anesthesia. Post-operative pain is generally minimal and reduced by icy or cold foods. The procedure is often combined with tonsillectomy (this combination is usually called an &quot;adenotonsillectomy&quot; or &quot;T&amp;A&quot;), for which the recovery time is an estimated 10–14 days, sometimes longer, mostly dependent on age.

Adenoidectomy is not often performed under one year of age as adenoid function is part of the body&#x27;s immune system, but its contribution to this decreases progressively beyond this age.

==Medical uses==
The indications for adenoidectomy are still controversial. Widest agreement surrounds the removal of the adenoid for obstructive sleep apnea, usually combined with tonsillectomy. Even then, it has been observed that a significant percentage of the study population (18%) did not respond.
There is also support for adenoidectomy in recurrent otitis media in children previously treated with tympanostomy tubes.
Finally, the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, common cold, otitis media and moderate nasal obstruction has been questioned with the outcome, in some studies, being no better than watchful waiting.

==Frequency==

In 1971, more than one million Americans underwent tonsillectomies and/or adenoidectomies, of which 50,000 consisted of adenoidectomy alone.

By 1996, roughly a half million children underwent some surgery on their adenoid and/or tonsils in both outpatient and inpatient settings. This included approximately 60,000 tonsillectomies, 250,000 combined tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies, and 125,000 adenoidectomies. By 2006, the total number had risen to over 700,000 but when adjusted for population changes, the tonsillectomy &quot;rate&quot; had dropped from 0.62 per thousand children to 0.53 per thousand. A larger decline for combined tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy was noted - from 2.20 per thousand to 1.46. There was no significant change in adenoidectomy rates for chronic infectious reasons (0.25 versus 0.21 per 1000).

==History==
Adenoidectomy was first performed using a ring forceps through the nasal cavity by William Meyer in 1867.

In the early 1900s, adenoidectomies began to be routinely combined with tonsillectomy. Initially, the procedures were performed by otolaryngologists, general surgeons, and general practitioners but over the past 30 years have been performed almost exclusively by otolaryngologists.

Then, adenoidectomies were performed as treatment of anorexia nervosa, mental retardation, and enuresis or to promote &#x27;good health&#x27;. By current standards, these indications seem odd but may be explained by the hypothesis that children might have failed to thrive if they had chronically sore throats or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Also, children who heard poorly because of chronic otitis media might have had unrecognized speech delay mistaken for intellectual disability. Adenoidectomy might have helped to resolve ear fluid problems, speech delays, and consequent perceptions of low intelligence.

The relationship between enuresis and obstructive apnea, and the benefit of adenoidectomy by implication, is complex and controversial. On one hand, the frequency of enuresis declines as children grow older. On the other, the size of the adenoid, and again by implication, any obstruction that they might be causing, also declines with increasing age. These two factors make it difficult to distinguish the benefits of adenoidectomy from age-related spontaneous improvement. Further, most of the studies in the medical literature which appear to show benefit from adenoidectomy have been case reports or case series. Such studies are prone to unintentional bias. Finally, a recent study of six thousand children has not shown an association between enuresis and obstructive sleep in general but an increase with advancing severity of obstructive sleep apnea, observed only in girls.

A decline in the frequency of the procedure started in the 1930s as its use became controversial. Tonsillitis and adenoiditis requiring surgery became less frequent with the development of antimicrobial agents and a decline in upper respiratory infections among older school-aged children. Also, several studies had shown that adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were ineffective for many of the indications used at that time as well as the suggestion of an increased risk of developing poliomyelitis after the procedure, later disproved. Prospective clinical trials, performed over the last 2 decades, have redefined the appropriate indications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&amp;A), tonsillectomy alone, and adenoidectomy alone.

<doc id="494261" wikidata="Q124686" url="?curid=494261" title="Cellulose acetate">
<text>In biochemistry, cellulose acetate refers to any acetate ester of cellulose, usually cellulose diacetate. It was first prepared in 1865. A bioplastic, cellulose acetate is used as a film base in photography, as a component in some coatings, and as a frame material for eyeglasses; it is also used as a synthetic fiber in the manufacture of cigarette filters and playing cards. In photographic film, cellulose acetate film replaced nitrate film in the 1950s, being far less flammable and cheaper to produce.

==History==
In 1865, French chemist Paul Schützenberger discovered that cellulose reacts with acetic anhydride to form cellulose acetate. The German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker invented the first soluble forms of cellulose acetate in 1903.

In 1904, Camille Dreyfus and his younger brother Henri performed chemical research and development on cellulose acetate in a shed in their father&#x27;s garden in Basel, Switzerland, which was then a center of the dye industry. For five years, the Dreyfus brothers studied and experimented in a systematic manner in Switzerland and France. By 1910, they were producing film for the motion picture industry, and a small but constantly growing amount of acetate lacquer, called &quot;dope&quot;, was sold to the expanding aircraft industry to coat the fabric covering wings and fuselage.

In 1913, after some twenty thousand separate experiments, they produced excellent laboratory samples of continuous filament yarn, something that had eluded the cellulose acetate industry to this time. Unfortunately, the outbreak of World War I postponed commercial development of this process.

In November 1914, the British Government invited Dr. Camille Dreyfus to come to England to manufacture acetate dope, and the &quot;British Cellulose and Chemical Manufacturing Co&quot; was set up. In 1917, after the United States had entered the war, the U.S. War Department invited Dr. Dreyfus to establish a similar factory in the U.S. Both operations were run successfully throughout the war.

After the war, attention returned to the production of acetate fibers. The first yarn was of fair quality, but sales resistance was heavy, and silk associates worked zealously to discredit acetate and discourage its use. However, the thermoplastic nature of acetate made it an excellent fiber for moiré because the pattern was permanent and did not wash away. The same characteristic also made permanent pleating a commercial fact for the first time, and gave great style impetus to the whole dress industry.

The mixing of silk and acetate in fabrics was accomplished at the beginning, and almost at once cotton was also blended, thus making possible low-cost fabrics by means of a fiber which then was cheaper than silk or acetate. Today, acetate is blended with silk, cotton, wool, nylon, etc. to give fabrics excellent wrinkle recovery, good heft, handle, draping quality, quick drying, proper dimensional stability, cross-dye pattern potential, at a very competitive price.

==Chemical and physical properties==
The density of Cellulose acetate is between 1.26 - 1.31 g/cc

==Use as a fiber==
Cellulose acetate fiber, one of the earliest synthetic fibers, is based on cotton or tree pulp cellulose (&quot;biopolymers&quot;). These &quot;cellulosic fibers&quot; have been replaced in many applications by cheaper petro-based fibers (nylon and polyester) in recent decades.

Trade names for acetate include Acele, Avisco, Celanese, Chromspun, and Estron.

Acetate shares many similarities with rayon, and was formerly considered as the same textile. Acetate differs from rayon in the employment of acetic acid in production. The two fabrics are now required to be listed distinctly on garment labels.

Rayon resists heat while acetate is prone to melting. Acetate must be laundered with care either by hand-washing or dry cleaning. 

The breathable nature of the fabric suits it for use as a lining. Acetate fabric is used frequently in wedding gowns and other bridal attire. Its lustrous sheen and smooth, satiny texture make it a good alternative to silk.

===Properties===

Acetate is a low cost, manufactured fiber, which has good draping qualities. Acetate is used in fabrics such as satins, brocades, knit fabrics, and taffetas to accentuate luster, body, drape, and beauty.

*Hand: soft, smooth, dry, crisp, resilient
*Comfort: breathes, wicks, dries quickly, no static cling
*Drape: linings move with the body linings conform to the garment
*Color: deep brilliant shades with atmospheric dyeing meet colorfastness requirements
*Luster: light reflection creates a signature appearance
*Performance: colorfast to perspiration staining, colorfast to dry cleaning, air and vapor permeable
*Tenacity: weak fiber with breaking tenacity of 1.2 to 1.4 g/d; rapidly loses strength when wet 
*Abrasion: poor resistance
*Heat retention: poor thermal retention; no allergenic potential (hypoallergenic)
*Dyeability: (two methods) cross-dying method where yarns of one fiber and those of another fiber are woven into a fabric in a desired pattern; solution-dying method provides excellent color fastness under the effects of sunlight, perspiration, air contaminants and washing

===Characteristics===

* cellulosic and thermoplastic
* selective absorption and removal of low levels of certain organic chemicals
* easily bonded with plasticizers, heat, and pressure
* acetate is soluble in many common solvents (especially acetone and other organic solvents) and can be modified to be soluble in alternative solvents, including water
* hydrophilic: acetate wets easily, with good liquid transport and excellent absorption; in textile applications, it provides comfort and absorbency, but also loses strength when wet
* acetate fibers are hypoallergenic
* high surface area
* made from wood pulp, a renewable resource
* can be composted or incinerated
* can be dyed, however special dyes and pigments are required since acetate does not accept dyes ordinarily used for cotton and rayon (this also allows cross-dyeing)
* resistant to mold and mildew
* easily weakened by strong alkaline solutions and strong oxidizing agents
* can usually be washed or dry cleaned; generally does not shrink

=== Confusion with &quot;cellulose triacetate&quot; ===
Cellulose diacetate and cellulose triacetate are mistakenly referred to as the same fiber; although they are similar, their chemical identities differ. Triacetate is known as a generic description or primary acetate containing no hydroxyl group. Acetate fiber is known as modified or secondary acetate having two or more hydroxyl groups. Triacetate fibers, although no longer produced in the United States, contain a higher ratio of acetate-to-cellulose than do acetate fibers.

===Film===
Cellulose acetate film, made from cellulose diacetate and later cellulose triacetate, was introduced in 1934 as a replacement for the cellulose nitrate film stock that had previously been standard. When exposed to heat or moisture, acids in the film base begin to deteriorate to an unusable state, releasing acetic acid with a characteristic vinegary smell, causing the process to be known as &quot;vinegar syndrome&quot;. Acetate film stock is still used in some applications, such as camera negative for motion pictures. Since the 1980s, polyester film stock (sometimes referred to under Kodak&#x27;s trade name &quot;ESTAR Base&quot;) has become more commonplace, particularly for archival applications. Acetate film was also used as the base for magnetic tape, prior to the advent of polyester film.

===Magnetic tape===
Cellulose acetate magnetic tape was introduced by IBM in 1952 for use on their IBM 726 tape drive in the IBM 701 computer. It was much lighter and easier to handle than the metal tape introduced by UNIVAC in 1951 for use on their UNISERVO tape drive in the UNIVAC I computer. In 1956, cellulose acetate magnetic tape was replaced by the more stable PET film magnetic tape for use on their IBM 727 tape drive.

===Other products===

* Apparel: buttons, linings, blouses, dresses, wedding and party attire, home furnishings, draperies, upholstery and slip covers.
* Eyeglass frames are commonly made with cellulose acetate.
* Industrial uses: cigarette filters and other filters, ink reservoirs for fiber tip pens.
* High absorbency products: diapers and medical aid products.
* The original Lego bricks were manufactured from cellulose acetate from 1949 to 1963.
* Award Ribbon: Rosettes for equestrian events, dog/cat shows, corporate awards, advertising and identification products all use cellulose acetate ribbon.
* Playing cards may be made of cellulose acetate. 
* Toys
* Transparencies for overhead projection
* Certain pens, such as Pelikan 

==Production==

The Federal Trade Commission definition for acetate fiber is: &quot;A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is cellulose acetate. Where not less than 92 percent of the hydroxyl groups are acetylated, the term triacetate may be used as a generic description of the fiber.&quot;

Acetate is derived from cellulose by initially deconstructing wood pulp into a purified fluffy white cellulose. To manufacture a good product, special qualities of pulps, such as dissolving pulps, are used. The uneven reactivity of cellulose presents a common problem affecting the quality of the cellulose acetate product. The cellulose is reacted with acetic acid and acetic anhydride in the presence of sulfuric acid. It is subjected to a controlled, partial hydrolysis to remove the sulfate and a sufficient number of acetate groups to give the product the desired properties. The anhydroglucose unit is the fundamental repeating structure of cellulose and has three hydroxyl groups which can react to form acetate esters. The most common form of cellulose acetate fiber has an acetate group on approximately two of every three hydroxyls. This cellulose diacetate is known as secondary acetate, or simply as &quot;acetate&quot;.

After it is formed, cellulose acetate is dissolved in acetone, forming a viscous solution for extrusion through spinnerets (which resemble a shower head). As the filaments emerge, the solvent is evaporated in warm air via dry spinning, producing fine cellulose acetate fibers.

The first U.S. commercial acetate fiber was produced by the Celanese Corporation in 1924. Current U.S. acetate fiber producers are Celanese, and Eastman Chemical Company.

===Method===
To this day, no process for the direct production of cellulose acetates has been discovered. As attempts to produce a partial esterification of cellulose result only in a mixture of non-acetylated and fully acetylated cellulose, a two-step synthesis is applied: Cellulose is always completely converted first to cellulose triacetate and then by hydrolysis into cellulose acetates with low degrees of esterification.

Purified cellulose from wood pulp or cotton linters is mixed with glacial acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and a catalyst. The mixture is aged 20 hours during which partial hydrolysis occurs and acid resin precipitates as flakes. These are dissolved in acetone and the solution is purified by filtering. The solution is extruded by spinning in a column of warm air. Solvent is recovered. Filaments are stretched and wound onto beams, cones, or bobbins ready for use. Filaments are finally spun into fiber.

The production is divided into the following process stages:
*&quot;Mechanical conditioning of the pulp&quot;: The pulp, which is usually provided as roll or sheet pulp, is fibrillated by means of different types of shredders, such as hammermills and disk refiners, whereby the successive arrangement of both types of shredder ensures optimum dissolving.
*&quot;Chemical pre-treatment&quot;: The fibrillated cellulose is treated with acetic acid (if necessary with the addition of small quantities of sulphuric acid) with moderate stirring at 25 °C to 50 °C for about 1 h, resulting in continuous evaporation and condensation of the acetic acid in the spaces between the fibre particles. This causes the cellulose particles to swell, which facilitates the diffusion of the solvent particles into these particles during the following process stage. In addition to this acetic acid vapour pretreatment, there is also a pretreatment in a thin-pulp state. In this process, the cellulose is introduced into large quantities of water or diluted acetic acid and intensively stirred. Subsequent process steps such as pressing or centrifuging constantly increase the concentration of cellulose in the pulp. At the same time, acetic acid is added in ever higher concentrations. The advantage of this process is the saving of shredding, as the cellulose layers can be added directly into the stirred tank.
*&quot;Acetylating the cellulose&quot;: In the commercial production of cellulose acetates, the &quot;acetic acid process&quot; or the &quot;methylene chloride process&quot; are usually used for acetylation. In acetic acid processes, the pre-treated cellulose mass is reacted in an acetylation mixture of the solvent acetic acid with an excess of acetic anhydride, which serves as an esterification agent, and with sulphuric acid as a catalyst under vigorous mechanical mixing. The reaction is highly exothermic and therefore intensive cooling of the reaction vessels is required. The esterification process is terminated by adding water when a highly viscous clear reaction mixture has formed from the fibrous pulp. This solution must be gel-free and have the desired viscosity. In the methylene chloride process, methylene chloride is used in the acetylation mixture as a solvent instead of acetic acid. Since the low-boiling methylene chloride can be easily removed by distillation, process control is achieved even with highly viscous solutions. Even at low temperatures it can dissolve cellulose triacetate very well. A small amount of sulfuric acid can be used as a catalyst, but often also perchloric acid. However, acetic acid is usually also formed as a by-product of the reaction, so that the solvent is ultimately a mixture of methylene chloride, acetic anhydride and acetic acid. A very rare heterogeneous process is the fiber acetate process, which is only used for the production of cellulose triacetate as an end product. In this process, the cellulose is suspended in a non-solvent (such as benzene) and esterified with acetic anhydride in the presence of perchloric acid as catalyst.
*&quot;Partial hydrolysis&quot;: The desired secondary cellulose acetate types are obtained from cellulose triacetate by hydrolysis. For this purpose, the triacetate solution is heated to usually 60 to 80 °C in the presence of an acid catalyst (usually sulfuric acid) by adding water upon stirring and heating. The hydrolysis is controlled by the concentration of the sulfuric acid, the amount of water and the temperature in such a way that the desired molecular degradation (chain scission) is achieved. The hydrolysis process is then stopped by adding basic salts (e.g. sodium or magnesium acetate) which neutralize the acid catalyst.
* &quot;Precipitation of the cellulose acetate&quot;: When precipitating cellulose acetate from the reaction solution using dilute acetic acid, it is important to obtain uniform and easily washable cellulose acetate flakes. Before precipitation, any methylene chloride present must be completely distilled off. The acetic acid is then recovered.
*&quot;Washing and drying&quot;: By intensive washing, which is usually done in countercurrent, the acetic acid must be removed from the flakes down to the smallest traces, otherwise damage (&quot;charring&quot;) will occur during the drying process. After the washing liquid has been pressed off, the flakes are dried on a conveyor belt dryer through which hot air flows to a residual moisture content of approx. 2-5%. For the subsequent production of very high-quality, thermally stable, brightly colored and color-stable thermoplastic molding compounds, the cellulose acetate flakes are also bleached and stabilized in additional process steps (to minimize thermal degradation and discoloration) before final drying. 
*&quot;Mixing of the flakes&quot;: The final steps are similar to the processing of other plastics: Before the cellulose acetate flakes are transported to a collection container from where they are transported to the appropriate processing plants, the flakes are mixed in a precisely controlled manner. This is to compensate for deviations of the cellulose acetates from different production batches. For many further processing steps the flakes are usually ground into fine powders beforehand. In order to be able to use the cellulose acetate in plastics processing methods such as injection moulding, the powder must also be mixed with suitable plasticisers and other additives, such as functional additives for thermal, weathering, UV and IR stabilisation. The mixtures can be adapted to the corresponding subsequent processing requirements. From the compound produced by melting, granules are produced which can be delivered to the plastics processors.

==Disposal and degradation==
The global production of CA materials was over per year in 2008. While it was initially believed that CA was virtually non-biodegradable, it has been shown that after initial partial deacetylation, the polymer&#x27;s cellulose backbone is readily biodegraded by cellulase enzymes. In biologically highly active soil, CA fibers are completely destroyed after 4–9 months. Photodegradation is optimal with 280 nm or shorter wavelength UV-irradiation and enhanced by TiO2 pigment. CA cigarette filters take years to be broken down in the open.

==Trade names==
Cellulose acetate is marketed under various trade names, such as Tenite (Eastman Chemical Company), zyl and zylonite, Cellon (&quot;Deutsche Celluloid Fabrik&quot; in Eilenburg, Germany), and Rhodoid (&quot;Soc. des Usines Chim. Rhone-Poulenc&quot; in Paris, France; &quot;May &amp; Baker Ltd.&quot; in London, UK). Cast film of cellulose acetate manufactured by Celanese (Derbyshire, UK) is sold as Clarifoil.

==Other cellulose esters==
Cellulose acetate butyrate (&quot;CAB&quot;, &quot;Tenite II&quot;) and cellulose acetate propionate are related derivatives of cellulose, which are both used in inks and coatings. The chief difference between these and cellulose acetate is their solubility in a wider range of solvents.

<doc id="494262" wikidata="Q705702" url="?curid=494262" title="Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers">
<text>Samuel Liddell (or Liddel)MacGregor Mathers (8 or 11 January 1854 – 5 or 20 November 1918), born Samuel Liddell Mathers, was a British occultist and member of the S.R.I.A.. He is primarily known as one of the founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a ceremonial magic order of which offshoots still exist. He became so synonymous with the order that Golden Dawn scholar Israel Regardie observed in retrospect that &quot;the Golden Dawn was MacGregor Mathers.&quot;

==Early life==
Mathers was born on 8 or 11 January 1854 in Hackney, London, England. His father, William M. Mathers, died while he was still a boy. His mother, whose maiden name was Collins, died in 1885. He attended Bedford School and subsequently worked in Bournemouth as a clerk, before moving to London following the death of his mother.

His wife was Moina Mathers (née Mina Bergson), sister of the philosopher Henri Bergson.

==Lifestyle==
Mathers added the &quot;MacGregor&quot; surname as a claim to Highland Scottish heritage. He was a practising vegetarian, or (according to some accounts) vegan, an outspoken anti-vivisectionist, and a non-smoker. It is known that his main interests were magic and the theory of war, his first book being a translation of a French military manual, &quot;Practical Instruction in Infantry Campaigning Exercise&quot; (1884).

Mathers became increasingly eccentric in his later years as was noted by W. B. Yeats.

===Freemasonry===
Mathers was introduced to Freemasonry by a neighbour, alchemist Frederick Holland, and was initiated into Hengist Lodge No.195 on 4 October 1877. He was raised as a Master Mason on 30 January 1878. In 1882 he was admitted to the Metropolitan College of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia as well as a number of fringe Masonic degrees. Working hard both for and in the SRIA he was awarded an honorary 8th Degree in 1886, and in the same year he lectured on the Kabbalah to the Theosophical Society. He became Celebrant of Metropolitan College in 1891 and was appointed as Junior Substitute Magus of the SRIA in 1892, in which capacity he served until 1900. He left the order in 1903, having failed to repay money which he had borrowed.

In 1891, Mathers assumed leadership of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn upon the death of William Robert Woodman. He moved with his wife to Paris on 21 May 1892. After his expulsion from the Golden Dawn in April 1900, Mathers formed a group in Paris in 1903 called &quot;Alpha et Omega&quot; (its headquarters, the Ahathoor Temple). Mathers chose the title &quot;Archon Basileus&quot;.

===Translations===
Mathers was a polyglot; among the languages he had studied were English, French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Gaelic and Coptic, though he had a greater command of some languages than of others. His translations of such books as &quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot; (14th century), Christian Knorr von Rosenroth&#x27;s &quot;The Kabbalah Unveiled&quot; (1684), &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; (anonymous, 14th century), &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (anonymous, 17th century), and the &quot;Grimoire of Armadel&quot; (17th century), while probably justly criticised with respect to quality, were responsible for making what had been obscure and inaccessible material widely available to the non-academic English-speaking world. They have had considerable influence on the development of occult and esoteric thought since their publication, as has his consolidation of the Enochian magical system of John Dee and Edward Kelley.

==Criticism==
In addition to many supporters, he had many enemies and critics. One of his most notable enemies was one-time friend and pupil Aleister Crowley, who portrayed Mathers as a villain named SRMD in his 1917 novel &quot;Moonchild&quot;. According to Crowley&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;The Confessions of Aleister Crowley&quot;, Mathers was in the habit of ostensibly playing chess matches against various pagan gods. Mathers would set up the chessboard and seat himself behind the white(s) pieces, with an empty chair opposite him. After making a move for himself, Mathers would then shade his eyes and peer towards the empty chair, waiting for his opponent to signal a move. Mathers would then move a black piece accordingly, then make his next move as white, and so forth. Crowley did not record who won.

Earlier, Crowley wrote in his &quot;Confessions&quot; that: &quot;As far as I was concerned, Mathers was my only link with the Secret Chiefs to whom I was pledged. I wrote to him offering to place myself and my fortune unreservedly at his disposal; if that meant giving up the Abra-Melin Operation for the present, all right.&quot;

In &quot;The Doctrine and Literature of the Kabalah&quot; (1902), A. E. Waite criticises Mathers&#x27; previously published work on the subject, in the following terms: &quot;the &quot;Kabbalah Unveiled&quot; [1887] of Mr. S. L. MacGregor Mathers, which is largely translation and commentary, and, in addition to other limitations, embraces therefore only a small portion of an extensive literature.&quot;

==Decline and death==
Mathers died on 5 or 20 November 1918 in Paris. The manner of his death is unknown; his death certificate lists no cause of death. Aleister Crowley wrote in his &quot;Confessions&quot; of the decline of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as that of MacGregor Mathers. He lamented what he saw as the irredeemable changes by Waite in his order and MacGregor Mathers&#x27;s legacy of well-meaning but low-quality leadership in his last years.

<doc id="494275" wikidata="Q698256" url="?curid=494275" title="On Kawara">
<text>was a Japanese conceptual artist who lived in SoHo, New York City, from 1965 until his death. He took part in many solo and group exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale in 1976.

==Early life==
Kawara was born in Kariya, Japan on December 24, 1932. After graduating from Kariya High School in 1951, Kawara moved to Tokyo. Kawara went to Mexico in 1959, where his father was the director of an engineering company. He stayed three years, painting, attending art school and exploring the country. From 1962 to 1964 he moved back and forth between New York and Paris. He travelled through Europe before settling in 1965 in New York City, where he was an intermittent resident until his death.

==Work==
Kawara belonged to a broadly international generation of conceptual artists that began to emerge in the mid-1960s, stripping art of personal emotion, reducing it to nearly pure information or idea and greatly playing down the art object. Along with Lawrence Weiner, Joseph Kosuth, Hanne Darboven and others, Kawara gave special prominence to language.

===&quot;Paris-New York Drawings&quot;===
From 1962 to 1964 Kawara made about 200 &quot;Paris-New York Drawings&quot;. Their motifs include stripes and grids like those of the Minimalist painter Agnes Martin. Other drawings depict installation pieces that fill rooms with networks of string.

===&quot;Today&quot; series===

From January 4, 1966, Kawara made a long series of &quot;Date paintings&quot; (the &quot;Today&quot; series), which consist entirely of the date on which the painting was executed in simple white lettering set against a solid background. The date is always documented in the language and grammatical conventions of the country in which the painting is executed (i.e., “26. ÁG. 1995,” from Reykjavík, Iceland, or “13 JUIN 2006,” from Monte Carlo); Esperanto is used when the first language of a given country does not use the Roman alphabet (“6 AŬG. 1993”, from Tokyo). The series is an example of word art.

The paintings, executed in Liquitex on canvas, conform to one of eight standard sizes, ranging from 8x10 inches up to four by six feet, all horizontal in orientation. The exceptions are the three paintings, roughly five by seven feet, executed on July 16, 20 and 21, 1969 — three days when the world was riveted by the Apollo 11 Moon landing.

The dates on the paintings, hand-painted with calculated precision, are always centered on the canvas and painted white, whereas the background colors vary; the paintings from the early years tend to have bold colors, and the more recent ones tend to be darker in tone. For example, Kawara briefly used red for several months in 1967 and then returned to darker hues until 1977. Four coats of paint are carefully applied for the ground and each allowed enough time to dry before being rubbed down in preparation for subsequent coats. Eschewing stencils in favor of hand-drawn characters, Kawara skillfully renders the script, initially a sans-serif, elongated version of Gill Sans, later a quintessentially modernist Futura. Each work is carefully executed by hand. Some days he made more than one. When Kawara was unable to complete the painting on the day it was started he immediately destroyed it. When a &quot;Date Painting&quot; is not exhibited, it is placed in a cardboard box custom-made for the painting, which is lined with a clipping from a local newspaper from the city in which the artist made the painting; most clippings are from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Although the boxes are part of the work, they are rarely exhibited. Each year between 63 and 241 paintings were made.

Each &quot;Date Painting&quot; is registered in a journal and marked on a &quot;One Hundred Years Calendar&quot;. When Kawara finished a painting, he applied a swatch of the paint mixture he used to a small rectangle that was then glued onto a chart in the journal. Under each colour is a number showing the painting&#x27;s sequence in that year and a letter indicating its size. The 48 journals therefore record the details of the painting&#x27;s size, color and newspaper headline, while the calendar uses colored dots to indicate the days in which a painting was made, and to record the number of days since the artist&#x27;s birth. Kawara created nearly 3,000 date paintings in more than 112 cities worldwide in a project that was planned to end only with his death.

===&quot;Title&quot; and postcards===
Much like the &quot;Today&quot; series, Kawara uses the number of days followed by the date the work was executed as his life-dates. The piece entitled &quot;Title&quot; at the National Gallery of Art has Kawara&#x27;s life-dates as 26,697 (January 27, 2006) which, when calculated, place Kawara&#x27;s birthdate at December 24, 1932. Other series of works include the &quot;I Went and I Met&quot; series of postcards sent to his friends detailing aspects of his life, and a series of telegrams sent to friends and neighbors bearing the message &quot;I AM STILL ALIVE&quot;. Between 1968 and 1979, On Kawara created his information series, &quot;I Got Up&quot;, in which he sent two picture postcards from his location on that morning. All of the 1,500 cards list the artist&#x27;s time of getting up, the date, the place of residence and the name and address of the receiver; another series of postcards, &quot;I Got Up At&quot;, was rubber-stamped with the time he got up that morning. The length of each correspondence ranged from a single card to hundreds sent consecutively over a period of months; the gesture&#x27;s repetitive nature is counterbalanced by the artist&#x27;s peripatetic global wanderings and exceedingly irregular hours (in 1973 alone he sent postcards from twenty-eight cities).

===&quot;One Million Years&quot;===
&quot;One Million Years&quot; is one of the artist&#x27;s best-known works about the passage and marking of time. It lists each year for the one million-year period leading up to the artwork&#x27;s conception and the million years that follow it. The work listing the past million years is dedicated to &quot;all of those who have lived and died&quot;, and the work for the future million years is dedicated to &quot;the last one&quot;. It is sometimes performed, during which pairs of performers (typically one male and one female for each segment) read dates from each list in order, simultaneously performing &quot;One Million Years [Past]&quot; and &quot;One Million Years [Future]&quot;.

The artwork was first made in 1969, the year of the Woodstock music festival, major civil protests against the Vietnam War and man&#x27;s first landing on the Moon. The first audio presentation of the reading of &quot;One Million Years&quot; occurred in 1993 during Kawara&#x27;s yearlong solo exhibition “One Thousand Days One Million Years” at Dia Center for the Arts in New York. Visitors could hear &quot;One Million Years [Future]&quot; being read, while viewing &quot;One Million Years [Past]&quot; and a group of date paintings. In 2002 Oliver Augst and Christoph Korn directed the radio production of the Hessischer Rundfunk of &quot;One Million Years&quot; (consisting of 32 CDs). The longest public reading from &quot;One Million Years&quot; took place at &quot;documenta&quot; 11 in 2002, where male and female participants sat side by side in a glass enclosure taking turns reading dates for the duration of the 100-day exhibition, switching between &quot;[Past]&quot; and &quot;[Future]&quot;. In 2004, the project traveled to Trafalgar Square in London for a continuous outdoor reading lasting 7 days and 7 nights. Since then, readings and recordings have taken place in cities around the world.

===One-hundred-year calendars===
For his one-hundred-year calendars, Kawara, starting with the date of his birth, systematically marks each day of his life with a yellow dot on the calendars, and registers a completed date painting with a green dot (red dots signify that more than one painting was completed on that given day).

===&quot;Pure Consciousness&quot;===
In &quot;Pure Consciousness,&quot; a traveling exhibition initiated in 1998, Kawara lent seven &quot;Date paintings&quot; (January 1 to January 7, 1997) to kindergartens and schools in Madagascar, Australia, Bhutan, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Colombia, Turkey, Japan, Finland, Iceland, Palestine, Canada and the United States. At all schools they hang in classrooms, bearing dates that fall within the lifespans of the children.

==Exhibitions==
Kawara&#x27;s first exhibitions include the first Nippon Exhibition, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, in 1953, and at the Takemiya and Hibiya galleries the following year. His work was exhibited at New York&#x27;s Dwan Gallery in 1967, and his one-person exhibition &quot;One Million Years&quot; was shown in Düsseldorf, Paris, and Milan in 1971. Kawara&#x27;s work was included in &quot;documenta&quot; 5 (1972), 7 (1982), and 11 (2002), in Kassel, and in the Tokyo Biennale (1970), the Kyoto Biennale (1976), and the Venice Biennale (1976).

His work has been included in many conceptual art surveys from the seminal &quot;Information&quot; show at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1970 to &quot;Reconsidering the Object of Art: 1965-1975&quot; at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 1995. Solo exhibitions of his work have included the Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles, and the Centre Pompidou, Paris, in 1977; &quot;Continuity/Discontinuity&quot; at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm in 1980; Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam in 1991; the Dia Center for the Arts, New York in 1993; and the Dallas Museum of Art.

Kawara&#x27;s first comprehensive retrospective, &quot;On Kawara—Silence&quot; at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, was installed in 12 sections according to a plan devised by himself. Two years before his death, the artist offered the exhibition curator Jeffrey Weiss a list of oblique titles—including “48 Years,” “Self-Observation” and “Monologue”—for each of the sections. The exhibition was held from February 6 through May 3, 2015, and also featured a live reading of Kawara&#x27;s &quot;One Million Years&quot;.

==Artist books==
Kawara created several artist&#x27;s books:
* &quot;One Million Years&quot;, 1999, Editions Micheline Szwajcer &amp; Michèle Didier (2 volumes)
* &quot;I MET&quot;, 2004, Editions Micheline Szwajcer &amp; Michèle Didier (12 volumes)
* &quot;I WENT&quot;, 2007, mfc-michèle didier (12 volumes)
* &quot;I GOT UP&quot;, 2008, mfc-michèle didier (12 volumes)
* &quot;Trilogy&quot;, 2008, mfc-michèle didier (3x12 volumes)
* &quot;I READ&quot;, 2017, mfc-michèle didier (6 volumes)
* &quot;UNANSWERED QUESTIONS&quot;. This book is the documentation of Personal Structures Art Projects #04. Published by European Cultural Centre.

==Art market==
In 2007, one of Kawara&#x27;s &quot;Date Paintings&quot; was sold for $1.8 million at Christie&#x27;s New York. Another date painting, &quot;May 1, 1987&quot;, set an auction record for Kawara when it sold for almost $2 million at Christie&#x27;s New York in 2014.

==Death==
Kawara died in New York on July 10, 2014, at the age of 81. His published obituaries state that he was alive for 29,771 days rather than giving dates of birth and death. Kawara&#x27;s &quot;100 Years Calendar&quot; indicates that he was born on December 24, 1932, not on 2 January 1933, as was officially recorded. This would make the date of his death June 27, 2014.

==Influences on contemporary artists==

The audiovisual work is largely informed by Kawara&#x27;s ideas.
* From February 6 to May 3, 2015 (concurrent with the exhibition On Kawara - Silence at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) Doeringer recreated Kawara&#x27;s daily &quot;I Got Up&quot;, &quot;I Met&quot;, &quot;I Went&quot;, and &quot;I Read&quot; projects and made 30 &quot;Today&quot; paintings for his &quot;Echoes&quot; project

*Rakawa.net is a micro-blogging website, which is devoted to honor On Kawara&#x27;s work and simultaneously offers users to document and to inform about daily accomplishments, based on the question &quot;What have you achieved today?&quot; and optionally illustrated by a picture.
*In the series &quot;QRs for Kawara&quot;, Brazilian artist Marcelo de Melo creates a QR code on 10 July of every year stating that On Kawara has been dead for x number of years. It is a direct reference to Kawara&#x27;s &quot;I Am Still Alive&quot; telegrams. The codes are made public through the blog themelopedia.
*The NFT (non-fungible token) series &quot;date pixels&quot; by DEJA DEAD pays homage to On Kawara&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; series by applying the concept of a daily creation showcasing that day&#x27;s date to a 24x24 pixel canvas, and minting it to the Ethereum blockchain.

<doc id="494279" wikidata="Q540171" url="?curid=494279" title="Konpeitō">
<text>, also spelled kompeitō, is a type of Japanese sugar candy. It takes the form of a small sphere with a bumpy surface, and comes in a variety of colors and flavors. Introduced from Portugal as a sugar-coated confection with a poppy seed or sesame seed center, &quot;konpeitō&quot; was eventually transformed into an all-sugar confection with a center.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Portuguese word (&quot;comfit&quot;), which is a type of sugar candy, and also an umbrella term for sweets in general.

The characters (lit. &quot;golden flat sugar&quot;) are selected mostly for their phonetic value and can also be written or .

== History ==
The technique for producing sugar candy was introduced to Japan in the early 16th century by Portuguese traders. The infrastructure and refining technology of sugar had not yet been established in Japan. As uses much sugar, it was rare and expensive. In 1569, Luís Fróis, a Portuguese missionary, presented a glass flask of to Oda Nobunaga in order to obtain the permit for mission work of Christianity.

By the Meiji period, had already been culturally prescribed as one of the standards of Japanese sweets—the character Sugar Plum Fairy in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; was translated into (, &quot;Fairy of &quot;).

==Production==
&quot;Konpeitō&quot; is usually in diameter and is produced by repeatedly coating a sugar syrup over a core consisting of a grain of coarse sugar. Originally, the core was a poppy seed. The process is somewhat similar to the &quot;dragée&quot; process, except the candies are produced by being ladled with sugar syrup and rotated slowly in a large heated gong-shaped tub (jap. 銅鑼, &quot;dora&quot;). Each grain of the core sugar grows over the course of several days with the continued rotating, heating, and application of syrup, becoming a ball covered with tiny bulges. It usually takes 7–13 days to make &quot;konpeitō&quot; and they are still crafted by artisans today.

== Other uses ==

The Japanese Ministry of Defense&#x27;s Emergency Food Ration tins and the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force&#x27;s Combat Ration tins both contain &quot;konpeito&quot; candies, in addition to hard tack bread/biscuits and other food items. While the candies aid in the calorie content necessary for activities, it also helps promote the creation of saliva to make it easier to eat the dry bread. According to the Ministry of Defense&#x27;s specifications, &quot;Each white emergency ration bag will contain 150g of small dry bread, with 8 whites, 3 reds, 2 yellows, 2 greens as standard, amounting to 15g or more to be put in the bag.” It is thought that providing the &#x27;colorful and enjoyable&#x27; &quot;Konpeito&quot; will also reduce the stress that would be experienced at times during a disaster.

&quot;Konpeito&quot; is often used for celebrations such as marriage and childbirth, in elaborate candy boxes called &quot;bonbonniere&quot; (), from the French , meaning &quot;candy box&quot;. It is given as a gift for prayers at shrines and temples. The practice of giving bonbonniere dates back to the commemoration ceremony of the Meiji Constitution in 1889 and has since been thought to be a symbol of good luck. The Japanese Imperial Family has used these &quot;Onshino Konpeitō&quot; as the official ‘Welcome’ gift continuously for over 130 years.

<text>Stop bath is an acidic solution used for processing black-and-white photographic films, plates, and paper. It is used to neutralize the alkaline developer, thus halting development.

Stop bath is commonly a 2% dilution of acetic acid in water, though a 2.5% solution of potassium or sodium metabisulfite works just as well. Because organic developers only work in alkaline solutions, stop bath halts the development process almost immediately and provides precise control of development time. Neutralizing the alkalinity of basic developers also helps to preserve the strength of the fixer, making it last longer.

Stop bath accounts for the vinegar-like odor of the darkroom. In its concentrated form it can cause chemical burns, but is harmless when diluted to a working solution. Stop bath becomes exhausted when carried over developer causes the solution to become alkaline. For indicator stop baths, which changes color to indicate when the bath is exhausted and no longer effective, a pH indicator dye like bromocresol purple is used. Low-odor stop baths use citric acid or sodium bisulfite in place of acetic acid.

<text>Josep Puig i Cadafalch (; 17 October 1867 in Mataró – 21 December 1956 in Barcelona) was a Catalan &quot;Modernista&quot; architect who designed many significant buildings in Barcelona, and a politician who had a significant role in the development of Catalan institutions. He was the architect of the Casa Martí (also known as &quot;Els Quatre Gats&quot;), which became a place of ideas, projects and social gatherings for such well-known Catalans as Santiago Rusiñol and Ramon Casas.

Although Puig i Cadalfach&#x27;s style separated him significantly from his contemporary Gaudí, their relations were neither tense nor problematic, as demonstrated by the participation of both architects in the construction of the Cafe Torino. Another of his significant buildings was the Casa Terrades (also known as &quot;les Punxes&quot;), which is known for its medieval castle style from the north of Europe.

Puig i Cadalfach was actively involved in politics. He was a Barcelona City Councillor from 1901 to 1903, served in the Spanish Parliament from 1907 to 1910 and was the second president of the Commonwealth of Catalonia from 1917 to 1924. From 1942 to his death in 1956, he was the president of the academic institution of the Catalan language, the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans&quot;.

He was also a great defender of Catalan culture and history which he hoped to see fully restored. He published studies of language, legal order and political organisation in the 11th-12th centuries. Amongst his important legacies is also the documentation and photographing of the culturally important buildings and art works the Vall d&#x27;Aran and Alta Ribagorça (including the Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí) during an expedition sponsored by the Institute for Catalan Studies in 1907.

<text>Children&#x27;s Day is a commemorative date celebrated annually in honour of children, whose date of observance varies by country. 
In 1925, International Children&#x27;s Day was first proclaimed in Geneva during the World Conference on Child Welfare. Since 1950, it is celebrated on 1 June in many countries, which follow the suggestion from Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation. World Children&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 20 November to commemorate the issuance of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child by the UN General Assembly on 20 November 1959, along with the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child on that date in 1989. In some countries, it is Children&#x27;s Week and not Children&#x27;s Day.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Children&#x27;s Day began on the second Sunday of June in 1857 by Reverend Dr. Charles Leonard, pastor of the Universalist Church of the Redeemer in Chelsea, Massachusetts: Leonard held a special service dedicated to, and for the children. Leonard named the day Rose Day, though it was later named Flower Sunday, and then named Children&#x27;s Day.

Children&#x27;s Day was first officially declared a national holiday by the Republic of Turkey in 1920 with the set date of 23 April. Children&#x27;s Day has been celebrated nationally since 1920 with the government and the newspapers of the time declaring it a day for the children. However, it was decided that an official confirmation was needed to clarify and justify this celebration and the official declaration was made nationally in 1929 by the founder and the President of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

=== International Children&#x27;s Day ===
International Children&#x27;s Day was first proclaimed in Geneva during the World Conference on Child Welfare in 1925. On 4 November 1949, 1 June was established as the International Day for Protection of Children by the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation in Moscow. Since 1950, 1 June is celebrated as Children&#x27;s Day in many Communist and post-Communist countries.

=== World Children&#x27;s Day ===
On 14 December 1954, a joint resolution by India and Uruguay was passed in the UN General Assembly to encourage all countries to institute a &quot;Universal Children&#x27;s Day&quot;, firstly to promote mutual exchange and understanding among children, and secondly to promote the ideals of the UN Charter and the welfare of the world&#x27;s children. It is now known as World Children&#x27;s Day, and is celebrated every year on 20 November. That date commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in a unanimous vote by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1959. It also marks the date in 1989 when the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is a legally binding document.

=== Modern initiatives ===
In 2000, the Millennium Development Goals outlined by world leaders to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. Albeit this applies to all people, the primary objective is concerning children. UNICEF is dedicated to meeting the six of eight goals that apply to the needs of children so that they are all entitled to fundamental rights written in the 1989 international human rights treaty. UNICEF delivers vaccines, works with policymakers for good health care and education and works exclusively to help children and protect their rights.

In September 2012, the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations led the initiative for the education of children. He firstly wants every child to be able to attend school, a goal by 2015. Secondly, to improve the skill set acquired in these schools. Finally, implementing policies regarding education to promote peace, respect, and environmental concern.
Universal Children&#x27;s Day is not just a day to celebrate children for who they are, but to bring awareness to children around the globe that have experienced violence in forms of abuse, exploitation, and discrimination. Children are used as laborers in some countries, immersed in armed conflict, living on the streets, suffering by differences be it religion, minority issues, or disabilities. Children feeling the effects of war can be displaced because of the armed conflict and may suffer physical and psychological trauma. The following violations are described in the term &quot;children and armed conflict&quot;: recruitment and child soldiers, killing/maiming of children, abduction of children, attacks on schools/hospitals and not allowing humanitarian access to children. Currently, there are about 153 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 who are forced into child labor. The International Labour Organization in 1999 adopted the Prohibition and Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour including slavery, child prostitution, and child pornography.

A summary of the rights under the convention on the Rights of the Child can be found on the UNICEF website.

Canada co-chaired the World Summit for children in 1990, and in 2002 the United Nations reaffirmed the commitment to complete the agenda of the 1990 World Summit. This added to the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s report &quot;We the Children: End-of Decade review of the follow-up to the World Summit for Children&quot;.

The United Nations children&#x27;s agency released a study referencing the population increase of children will make up 90 percent of the next billion people.

Children&#x27;s Day events are becoming more commercial, becoming important events to increase sales of children&#x27;s products.

Children&#x27;s Day was first conceived by progressive ethnic Korean students, with Korean independence movement leaders against Japanese colonialism. From Jinju, many people gathered to promote and improve the social status of children and encourage adults to teach awareness of their deprived sovereignty. In 1923, the ethnic Korean student group in Tokyo, ″&quot;Saekdong-hoe&quot;″ (색동회), proclaimed the first Children&#x27;s Day on May Day, later on 7 May. Bang Jeong-hwan, a co-founder of &quot;Saekdong-hoe&quot;, first coined the modern Korean word for children, (어린이), replacing the previous slang (애놈) or (애새끼). Celebration of Children&#x27;s Day in Korea has enlightened people about children&#x27;s fundamental human rights.

Since 1939, Government-General of Chosen, viewing Children&#x27;s Day as one of the nationalist movement by Korean independence activists, had oppressed the Children&#x27;s Day celebration. Since 1945, Children&#x27;s Day celebration has been resumed. The children&#x27;s welfare law written in the constitution officially designated 5 May as Children&#x27;s Day in 1961. And by &#x27;the law of holiday of government office&#x27;, Children&#x27;s day became a holiday in Korea in 1970.

====Myanmar====
In Myanmar, Children&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 13 February.

In 1954, the United Nations established Universal Children&#x27;s Day dedicated to improving children&#x27;s welfare worldwide. It is celebrated annually on 20 November. Besides, many countries have their own national holidays to celebrate children. For example, Children&#x27;s Day in Myanmar (former Burma) is celebrated on 13 February.

The date of Myanmar&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Day coincides with the birthday of Aung San, a Burmese revolutionary, politician and general who is considered the Father of the Nation in present-day Myanmar. He fought for Burma&#x27;s independence from Japan and the United Kingdom. It was decided to celebrate Aung San&#x27;s birthday as Children&#x27;s Day because &quot;he fought for a better future for Burmese children&quot;.

In the late 1980s, a military dictatorship was established in Myanmar. Naturally, the military government didn&#x27;t encourage the celebration of Aung San&#x27;s birthday and, by extension, Children&#x27;s Day.

The situation began to change after the 2011–2012 democratic reforms. Today, Children&#x27;s Day is officially celebrated in schools across Myanmar.

On 13 February, Burmese schools host special events for students. Their main goal is to emphasize the importance of education for the future of Burmese children, as well as to raise awareness of the problems that children and their parents face on a daily basis.

Secondary school/ middle school students still need to go to school on this day but teachers often organise special events and activities so older children could still celebrate. Children&#x27;s Day in Singapore is also celebrated not only to celebrate childhood but also to remind them of issues faced by children around the world.

====Taiwan====
Taiwan designated 4 April as Children&#x27;s Day (Chinese:兒童節; pinyin: Értóng Jié), pursuant to Article 5 of the &quot;Order to Implement Commemoration Days and Holidays&quot;. The holiday dates back to 1931 and since then schools often hold special activities to celebrate the occasion. Because of pressure from parents demanding to accompany their children in the celebration, Taiwan celebrated Women&#x27;s Day together with Children&#x27;s Day on 4 April 1991. Since then, 4 April has been known as &quot;The Combined Holidays of Women&#x27;s Day and Children&#x27;s Day&quot; (). It has been a public holiday of Taiwan since 2011.

The Executive Yuan stipulated in Article 5 of the &quot;Memorial Day and Festival Implementation Measures&quot; that on 4 April, Children&#x27;s Day, relevant organs, groups, and schools held celebration activities [2]. A one-day holiday was merged with Women&#x27;s Day from 1991 to 1997 (formally known as &quot;Women&#x27;s Day, Children&#x27;s Day Merger Holiday&quot;). After 1998, the holiday was canceled and it was incorporated into the week of holiday. In 1998, two days before the rest of the week, the children of elementary and junior high school students had a day off. Since 2011, it has returned to the national holiday and the country has a holiday for one day.

It was established as a holiday in 1955.

Usually, His Majesty the King gives advice addressing the children while the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand gives moral teaching. The Prime Minister also usually gives each Children&#x27;s Day a theme and a slogan.

Many Government offices are open to children and their family; this includes the Government House, the Parliament House Complex and various Military installations. These events may include a guided tour and an exhibition. A notable example is the guided tour at the Government House, where children have an opportunity to view the Prime Minister&#x27;s office and sit at the bureau. The Royal Thai Air Force usually invites children to go and explore the aircraft and the Bangkok Bank distributes stationeries, such as pens, pencils, and books to every child that enters the bank as a community service. Many organizations from both the government and commercial sectors have celebration activities for children. Children can enter zoos or ride buses for free.

Prior to 1977, Child Care Week was held in various Australian states and territories focusing on children in care or those in institutions. This event was held at different times throughout the year. In 1984, it was decided to coordinate a national week to include all children to align with Universal Children&#x27;s Day. In 1996 it was decided to adopt a permanent theme, &quot;A Caring World Shares&quot;, to celebrate the right of children to enjoy childhood. Organised events allow children to demonstrate their talents, skills and abilities.

National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children&#x27;s Day in Australia has been held each year, since 1988, on 4 August. This event was initially held against the backdrop of bicentennial year protests that obscured the importance of indigenous children. The 4 August had historically been the date Stolen Generation Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who had been separated from their families without knowledge of their true birth dates would celebrate their birthday. Today, the day brings Elders, families and their children together to celebrate the strengths of First Nation&#x27;s children and learn about the crucial impact that culture, family and community play in the life of every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child.

The New Zealand Government has recognized this as one of the most important issues for New Zealanders, with an event such as Children&#x27;s Day helping to focus on the practice of sharing, loving and caring as well as honoring &quot;tamariki&quot; (Maori for &#x27;children&#x27;).

====Vanuatu====

In Vanuatu, Children&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 24 July. The two main themes of the holiday are &quot;Stop violence against children&quot; and &quot;Give a child the chance to express their opinion today&quot;. After the march, there are speeches and activities organized by schools, including a dance. Then, after midday, children return home to spend time with their parents for the rest of the day. Children&#x27;s Day is a public holiday, set up following a recommendation of the committee on the Rights of the Child. A group of people in the United Nations monitor and protect children&#x27;s rights. A committee, with both adult and child members, organizes activities. In the past, a committee of adults has chosen the theme – but in the future children may help choose it.

Children&#x27;s Day originally took place only in the capital of Vanuatu, but it has now been extended to all 6 provinces. Schools, churches, local governments of the provinces and other local organizations all organize activities. Save the Children supports one Children&#x27;s Day activity in each province, selecting it from the many requests they receive for support. In 2008, one of the activities supported by Save the Children was a sports day between many different schools.

Parents and caretakers have been supportive of Children&#x27;s Day activities. Many parents come to activities with children. In one province, children and parents from five different schools came together for a shared lunch. Some parents give their children presents for Children&#x27;s Day – however, Save the Children try to spread the message that it doesn&#x27;t matter if a parent can&#x27;t afford to buy their child a present, as the real aim of Children&#x27;s Day is for parents and children to spend the day together, and work together to reconcile their problems.

<doc id="494305" wikidata="Q1203170" url="?curid=494305" title="Farallon plate">
<text>The Farallon plate was an ancient oceanic tectonic plate. It formed one of the three main plates of Panthalassa, alongside the Izanagi plate and the Phoenix plate, which were connected by a triple junction. The Farallon plate began subducting under the west coast of the North American plate—then located in modern Utah—as Pangaea broke apart and after the formation of the Pacific plate at the center of the triple junction during the Early Jurassic. It is named for the Farallon Islands, which are located just west of San Francisco, California. Over time, the central part of the Farallon plate was subducted under the southwestern part of the North American plate. The remains of the Farallon plate are the Explorer, Gorda, and Juan de Fuca plates, which are subducting under the northern part of the North American plate; the Cocos plate subducting under Central America; and the Nazca plate subducting under the South American plate.

The Farallon plate is also responsible for transporting old island arcs and various fragments of continental crust, which have rifted off of other distant plates. These fragments from elsewhere are called terranes (sometimes, &quot;exotic&quot; terranes). During the subduction of the Farallon plate, it accreted these island arcs and terranes to the North American plate. Much of western North America is composed of these accreted terranes.

== Tomographic imaging of the plate ==
As an ancient tectonic plate, the Farallon plate must be studied using methods that allow researchers to see deep beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface. The understanding of the Farallon plate has evolved as details from seismic tomography provide improved details of the submerged remnants. Since the North American west coast has a convoluted structure, significant work has been required to resolve the complexity.

Seismic tomography can be used to image the remainder of the subducted plate because it is still &quot;cold,&quot; as in, it has not reached thermal equilibrium with the mantle. This is important for the use of tomography because seismic waves have different velocities in materials of different temperatures, so the Farallon slab appears as a velocity anomaly on the tomography model.

=== Shallow angle subduction and deformation ===
Multiple studies show that the subduction of the Farallon plate was characterized by a period of &quot;flat-slab subduction,&quot; which is the subduction of a plate at a relatively shallow angle to the overriding crust (in this case, North America). This phenomenon is one that accounts for the far-inland orogenisis of the Rocky Mountains and other ranges in North America which are much farther from the convergent plate boundary than is typical of a subduction-generated orogeny.

Significant deformation of the slab also occurred due to this flat subduction phenomenon, which has been imaged by seismic tomography. There is a concentration of velocity anomalies in the tomography that is thicker than the slab itself should be, indicating that folding and deformation occurred beneath the surface during subduction. In other words, more of the slab should be in the lower mantle, but the deformation has caused it to remain shallower, in the upper mantle.

Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this shallow subduction angle and resulting deformation. Some studies suggest that the faster movement of the North American plate caused the slab to flatten, resulting in slab rollback. Another cause of flat slab subduction may be slab buoyancy, a characteristic influenced by the presence of oceanic plateaus (or oceanic flood basalts). In addition to influencing slab buoyancy, some oceanic plateaus may have also become accreted to North America.

It has been suggested that this deformation may go so far as to include a tear in the slab, where a piece of the subducted Farallon plate has broken off, creating multiple slab remnants. This is supported by tomography studies and provides some more explanation of the formation of Laramide structures that are further inland from the edge.

=== Interpretations of Farallon plate subduction ===
A 2013 study proposed two additional now-subducted plates that would account for some of the unexplained complexities of the accreted terranes, suggesting that the Farallon should be partitioned into Northern Farallon, Angayucham, Mezcalera and Southern Farallon segments based on recent tomographic models. Under this model, the North American continent overrode a series of subduction trenches, and several microcontinents (similar to those in the modern-day Indonesian Archipelago) were added to it. These microcontinents must have had adjacent oceanic plates that are not represented in previous models of Farallon subduction, so this interpretation brings forth a different perspective on the history of collision. Based on this model, the plate moved west, causing the following geologic events to occur:

* 165–155 Myr ago an exotic terrane (the Mezcalera promontory) started to be subducted and the orogenesis of the Rocky Mountains began.
* 125 Myr ago the North American plate collided with a chain of island arcs, causing the Sevier orogeny.
* 124–90 Myr ago the Omineca magmatic belts are formed in the Pacific Northwest as the Mezcalera promontory is overridden.
* 85 Myr ago Sonora volcanism in the Moctezuma volcanic field occurred.
* 85–55 Myr ago the Laramide orogeny occurred as buoyant terranes were accreted.
* 72–69 Myr ago the Carmacks volcanism occurred in present-day Canada as an island arc is completely subducted.
* 55–50 Myr ago the accretion of the Siletzia and Pacific Rim terranes occurred.
* 55–50 Myr ago the conclusion of the volcanism of the Coast Mountain island arc occurred.
When the final archipelago, the Siletzia archipelago, lodged as a terrane, the associated trench stepped west. When this happened, the trench that had been characterized as an oceanic-oceanic subduction environment approached the North American margin and eventually became the current Cascadia subduction zone. This created a slab window.

Other models have been proposed for the Farallon&#x27;s influence on the Laramide orogeny, including the dewatering of the slab which led to intense uplift and magmatism.

<doc id="494308" wikidata="Q438842" url="?curid=494308" title="Alternating series">
<text>In mathematics, an alternating series is an infinite series of terms that alternate between positive and negative signs. In capital-sigma notation this is expressed
formula_1 or formula_2
with for all .

Like any series, an alternating series is a convergent series if and only if the sequence of partial sums of the series converges to a limit. The alternating series test guarantees that an alternating series is convergent if the terms converge to 0 monotonically, but this condition is not necessary for convergence.

==Examples==
The geometric series − + − + ⋯ sums to .

The alternating harmonic series has a finite sum but the harmonic series does not. The series
formula_3
converges to formula_4, but is not absolutely convergent.

The Mercator series provides an analytic power series expression of the natural logarithm, given by
formula_5

The functions sine and cosine used in trigonometry and introduced in elementary algebra as the ratio of sides of a right triangle can also be defined as alternating series in calculus.
formula_6 and
formula_7
When the alternating factor is removed from these series one obtains the hyperbolic functions sinh and cosh used in calculus and statistics.

For integer or positive index α the Bessel function of the first kind may be defined with the alternating series
formula_8 where is the gamma function.

If is a complex number, the Dirichlet eta function is formed as an alternating series
formula_9
that is used in analytic number theory.

== Alternating series test ==
The theorem known as the &quot;Leibniz Test&quot; or the alternating series test states that an alternating series will converge if the terms converge to 0 monotonically.

Proof: Suppose the sequence formula_10 converges to zero and is monotone decreasing. If formula_11 is odd and formula_12, we obtain the estimate formula_13 via the following calculation:
formula_14

Since formula_10 is monotonically decreasing, the terms formula_16 are negative. Thus, we have the final inequality: formula_17. Similarly, it can be shown that formula_18. Since formula_19 converges to formula_20, the partial sums formula_21 form a Cauchy sequence (i.e., the series satisfies the Cauchy criterion) and therefore they converge. The argument for formula_11 even is similar.

== Approximating sums ==
The estimate above does not depend on formula_23. So, if formula_10 is approaching 0 monotonically, the estimate provides an error bound for approximating infinite sums by partial sums:
formula_25That does not mean that this estimate always finds the very first element after which error is less than the modulus of the next term in the series. Indeed if you take formula_26 and try to find the term after which error is at most 0.00005, the inequality above shows that the partial sum up through formula_27 is enough, but in fact this is twice as many terms as needed. Indeed, the error after summing first 9999 elements is 0.0000500025, and so taking the partial sum up through formula_28 is sufficient. This series happens to have the property that constructing a new series with formula_29 also gives an alternating series where the Leibniz test applies and thus makes this simple error bound not optimal. This was improved by the Calabrese bound, discovered in 1962, that says that this property allows for a result 2 times less than with the Leibniz error bound. In fact this is also not optimal for series where this property applies 2 or more times, which is described by Johnsonbaugh error bound. If one can apply the property an infinite number of times, Euler&#x27;s transform applies.

== Absolute convergence ==
A series formula_30 converges absolutely if the series formula_31 converges.

Theorem: Absolutely convergent series are convergent.

Proof: Suppose formula_30 is absolutely convergent. Then, formula_31 is convergent and it follows that formula_34 converges as well. Since formula_35, the series formula_36 converges by the comparison test. Therefore, the series formula_30 converges as the difference of two convergent series formula_38.

== Conditional convergence ==
A series is conditionally convergent if it converges but does not converge absolutely.

For example, the harmonic series

formula_39

diverges, while the alternating version

formula_40

converges by the alternating series test.

== Rearrangements ==
For any series, we can create a new series by rearranging the order of summation. A series is unconditionally convergent if any rearrangement creates a series with the same convergence as the original series. Absolutely convergent series are unconditionally convergent. But the Riemann series theorem states that conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to create arbitrary convergence. Agnew&#x27;s theorem describes rearrangements that preserve convergence for all convergent series. The general principle is that addition of infinite sums is only commutative for absolutely convergent series.

For example, one false proof that 1=0 exploits the failure of associativity for infinite sums.

As another example, by Mercator series
formula_41

But, since the series does not converge absolutely, we can rearrange the terms to obtain a series for formula_42:
formula_43

== Series acceleration ==
In practice, the numerical summation of an alternating series may be sped up using any one of a variety of series acceleration techniques. One of the oldest techniques is that of Euler summation, and there are many modern techniques that can offer even more rapid convergence.

<doc id="494309" wikidata="Q706246" url="?curid=494309" title="Joe Viterelli">
<text>Joseph Viterelli (March 10, 1937 – January 28, 2004) was an American actor. He was best remembered for playing Italian-American mobsters. He gained widespread recognition for portraying Jelly in &quot;Analyze This&quot; (1999) and &quot;Analyze That&quot; (2002). 

==Early life==
Viterelli was born on March 10, 1937, in New York City and grew up in a tough neighborhood on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. He played classical guitar but did not tell his friends about it. &quot;They woulda thought I was a sissy&quot;, he said. &quot;I used to save my hard-robbed money and sneak off to Carnegie Hall and Broadway theaters.&quot;

==Early career==
While in his 20s, he inherited four music schools in Queens that had been started by his family. &quot;I actually taught classical guitar. But things went wrong. Then I opened a few bars. I drove a truck. I owned a cleaning service. I even had a job drilling holes in bowling balls to feed my five kids.&quot;

Viterelli moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s. While living in Malibu, Viterelli became friends with director Leo Penn, who saw the screen possibilities in Viterelli&#x27;s tough-guy visage. Penn thought Viterelli&#x27;s tough-guy features would play well in the movies and on television.

Viterelli told Larry King that before he acted, &quot;I had a couple of beer joints that I sold in New York and I came out here (in California) and I was looking around.&quot;

==Acting==
&quot;(Leo Penn) asked me to be in some movies and TV, but I always declined,&quot; said Viterelli. &quot;I said, &#x27;For half my life, I&#x27;ve been keeping a low profile and now you want to put my mug on a 40-foot screen?&#x27;&quot;

Years later, Viterelli got a call from Penn&#x27;s actor son, Sean, who was in New York City to make the 1990 gangster melodrama &quot;State of Grace&quot;. Viterelli recalled: &quot;(Sean) said, &#x27;Joe, we&#x27;re looking for a character that&#x27;s from your neighborhood. We&#x27;ve seen about 50 to 60 people and nobody&#x27;s right.&#x27; He said the key words, &#x27;Would you do me a favor?&#x27;&quot; Viterelli did and, proving to be a natural actor, launched his new career. Viterelli later appeared in Penn&#x27;s &quot;The Crossing Guard&quot; (1995).

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Viterelli had appeared in more than 40 movies, playing guys with such names as Nick Valenti (&quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot;; 1994), Joe Profaci (&quot;Mobsters&quot;; 1991), Fat Tommy Carducci (&quot;What She Doesn&#x27;t Know&quot;; 1992), Vinnie &quot;The Shrimp&quot; (&quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot;; 1999) and Fat Tony Ragoni (&quot;The Cure for Boredom&quot;; 2001). He also had a supporting role in &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; (2001) and played Joseph Valachi in &quot;Ruby&quot; (1992). He also appeared in &quot;Eraser&quot; (1996).

A year before his death, Viterelli was considered for a role as former Governor of Illinois George Ryan in a biopic Abby Mann attempted to make.

===Jelly===
In 1999, he played Jelly, the menacing yet lovable henchman–confidant to Robert De Niro&#x27;s anxiety-prone mob boss, in &quot;Analyze This&quot; (1999), costarring Billy Crystal as De Niro&#x27;s reluctant psychiatrist.

Viterelli was able to convince De Niro and director Harold Ramis to cast him as Jelly after almost losing the role to a much younger actor.

When he described Viterelli&#x27;s Jelly character patiently padding about &quot;trying to deal with the disturbing news that his boss is cracking up and seeing a shrink,&quot; critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;He lends a subtle dimension to the movie; he gives [De Niro&#x27;s mob boss] a context, and someone who understands him. The comedy here isn&#x27;t all on the surface, and Viterelli is one reason why.&quot;

The sequel, &quot;Analyze That&quot;, in which Viterelli reprised his role, was his final film.

In a &quot;Larry King Live&quot; interview, Viterelli said that De Niro was the &quot;(e)asiest man to work with in the world,&quot; and that Crystal was &quot;the funniest guy I ever met in my life.&quot;

===Staples commercial===
Viterelli can be seen in a Staples television commercial in which he provides mob-style &quot;muscle&quot; for an office worker who is having a problem dealing with a manager who demands doughnuts and pastry bribes in exchange for dispensing office supplies. The humorous spot, which debuted during Super Bowl XXXVIII, was Viterelli&#x27;s only commercial.

==Personal life and death==
&quot;Ninety percent of my fan mail is from kids 6 through 19,&quot; he told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in 2000. &quot;They send me graduation pictures and report cards. Look at me, I&#x27;m a role model.&quot;

Viterelli never had an agent or a manager.

Viterelli participated in a roast of Magic Johnson, during which he told a joke about finding the former NBA star handcuffed to a tree naked, just after he had gotten robbed.

Viterelli died on January 28, 2004, aged 66, of complications from heart surgery at Valley Hospital in Las Vegas. He is survived by his wife, Catherine, and five children, including his son, the film composer Joseph Vitarelli, who spells his last name differently. One of his children is a lawyer.

<doc id="494310" wikidata="Q72318" url="?curid=494310" title="The Emperor's Birthday">
<text>is an annual public holiday in Japan celebrating the birthday of the reigning Emperor, which is currently 23 February as Emperor Naruhito was born on that day in 1960. It is enforced by the Emperor Abdication Law passed in 2017.

== History of holiday ==
=== Ancient – medieval ===
The name of is ancient, and derived from the birthday of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. It was changed to in 729 in the first year of Tenpyō, but it was renamed to in the 7th year of Tenpyo (748 in the first year of Katsuho) 19 years later. is taken from Laozi&#x27;s .

The earliest historical record of an Emperor&#x27;s birthday celebrations relates to the 6th year of Hōki in Emperor Kōnin&#x27;s reign (775 CE). The Emperor&#x27;s birthday was already celebrated during the Heian period. This is recorded in the record of Hōki 10 (779). It is recorded that:

This day being the &quot;Tencho&quot;, a great drinking feast was held for all the ministers, fine &quot;sake&quot; that are favoured [by the Emperor] were presented. After the feast, stipends were awarded. ()

An edict dated the 11th day of the Ninth month is also recorded:
The 13th day of the Tenth birthday being Our birthday, each year on this day, it is both emotional and celebratory. On this day, all the monks and nuns of the monasteries must on this day turn the sutras and perform the rituals, and no animals should be butchered throughout the country, and all of the officials of inner and outer courts are awarded feasts for the day. The day will be called &quot;Tenchosetsu&quot;. Thus the moral merit is used to repay the deceased imperial mother, and the celebration is spread throughout the land. ()

There is also a description in the as a record of the Muromachi period.

=== Modern – contemporary ===

On 26 August 1868 (11 October 1868), a decree by the Daijo-kan said, &quot;22 September, the Emperor&#x27;s Birthday is equivalent to the Emperor&#x27;s Birthday. On 22 September (6 November 1868), the Emperor&#x27;s Birthday was celebrated as a national holiday. In the 2nd year of the Meiji era (1869), the ministers of each country were invited to the Enryokan to receive a drink, and in the 3rd year of the Meiji era (1870), various officials, non-employees, Kazoku, etc. worshiped. The ministers and below received a feast at each ministry, and royal gun salute was shot on various warships. The ritual of the Emperor&#x27;s Festival was completed in 1872, in the same year of the Emperor&#x27;s Birthday.

Until 1948, it was called . &quot;Tenchōsetsu&quot; paralleled , &quot;Chikyū Festival&quot;, which referred to the Empress consort&#x27;s birthday. The two names originate from the idiom in , borrowed from Lao Tzu&#x27;s &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; during the reign of Emperor Kōnin (708–782 CE), meaning &quot;The sky and the earth, the universe is eternal,&quot; and expressed a hope for the eternal longevity of the reigning Emperor. After World War II in 1948, the government renamed it to and made the day a public holiday. Under the law, when the throne passes to a new Emperor, the National Diet must convene and change the holiday date&#x27;s to that of the new Emperor&#x27;s birthday. Thus, there exists a small chance that the former Emperor&#x27;s birthday may come before the change can be made.

During the reign of Emperor Hirohito (the Shōwa era, 1926–1989), the Emperor&#x27;s birthday was observed on 29 April. That date remained a public holiday, posthumously renamed Greenery Day in 1989 and Shōwa Day in 2007.

On 30 April 2019, the 125th Emperor Akihito abdicated as per the Constitution of Japan and in accordance with the Imperial Code Special Law Concerning the Retirement of the Emperor. Because Akihito&#x27;s birthday is December 23, and his successor Naruhito&#x27;s is 23 February, 2019 was the first year since the introduction of the Holidays Act in 1948 that there were no Emperor&#x27;s Birthday celebrations.

Because of concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the public celebrations for Naruhito&#x27;s birthday were cancelled in 2020 (Reiwa 2), 2021 (Reiwa 3) and 2022 (Reiwa 4). However, the emperor addressed and thanked the public for their wishes in a press conference and a recorded video message 2020 and 2021 respectively.

== Observance ==
Many citizens write letters to the Emperor during the week leading up to his birthday, and display the Japanese flag on the day.

On the Emperor&#x27;s Birthday, a public ceremony takes place at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, where the gates are opened (the palace is usually off-limits to the public). Usually only the surrounding park can be visited. The emperor, accompanied by the empress, and several other members of the imperial family appear on a palace balcony to acknowledge the birthday greetings of well-wishers waving Japanese flags. This event is called . Only on this occasion, and during New Year&#x27;s celebrations on 2 January, are members of the public permitted to enter the inner grounds of the palace. The crowd must wait in an orderly manner in a pre-established area between the main road and the building: at a later time the police accompany visitors, guiding them from the square in front of them to the inside of the building. Admission is free and those who wish are given a small Japanese flag. The area in front of the reception pavilion is called Chōwaden. Visitors wait in line next to the Nijubashi bridge, at around 9:30 in the morning the police make a first group of people cross the bridge and manage the entrance to the square below the balcony. At around 10:20 am, the emperor, accompanied by the empress, the heirs to the throne and their respective spouses, looks out on the balcony and the crowd below wishes the emperor long life by repeating the word &quot;banzai&quot; in chorus which means &quot;ten thousand years&quot; (for the Emperor). On the day of the holiday, the Imperial Palace complex and the surrounding streets are guarded by police, which, according to tradition, hand out small flags of Japan at the gate for free. Citizens may also bring their own if they wish.

Once his thanks and public greetings are concluded, the crowd begins to wave flags and the Imperial Family retreats inside the palace. The ceremony lasts three minutes in all, after which the group of subjects is guided outside, and a second group is allowed to enter. This operation is repeated several times, so that as many citizens as possible can pay homage to the emperor. The same evening, national television broadcasts a special during which the emperor addresses a few words of thanks to the country.

The crowd that attends the ceremony usually consists of adults and elderly people. Among the crowd, there may also be groups of foreign tourists who organize palace visits and enjoy the event.

== Song ==
&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Birthday ()&quot; () (lyrics Mayori Kurokawa, composer Yoshisa Oku) was enacted as &quot;a holiday festival date song&quot; in 1893 (Meiji 26).

These are the lyrics of the song:

<doc id="494313" wikidata="Q94916" url="?curid=494313" title="Second Italo-Ethiopian War">
<text>The Second Italo-Ethiopian War, also referred to as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, was a war of aggression waged by Italy against Ethiopia, which lasted from October 1935 to February 1937. In Ethiopia it is often referred to simply as the Italian Invasion (; Oromo: Weerara Xaaliyaanii), and in Italy as the Ethiopian War (). It is seen as an example of the expansionist policy that characterized the Axis powers and the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations before the outbreak of World War II.

On 3 October 1935, two hundred thousand soldiers of the Italian Army commanded by Marshal Emilio De Bono attacked from Eritrea (then an Italian colonial possession) without prior declaration of war. At the same time a minor force under General Rodolfo Graziani attacked from Italian Somalia. On 6 October, Adwa was conquered, a symbolic place for the Italian army because of the defeat at the Battle of Adwa by the Ethiopian army during the First Italo-Ethiopian War. On 15 October, Italian troops seized Aksum, and an obelisk adorning the city was torn from its site and sent to Rome to be placed symbolically in front of the building of the Ministry of Colonies.

Exasperated by De Bono&#x27;s slow and cautious progress, Italian prime minister Benito Mussolini replaced him with General Pietro Badoglio. Ethiopian forces attacked the newly arrived invading army and launched a counterattack in December 1935, but their poorly armed forces could not resist for long against the modern weapons of the Italians. Even the communications service of the Ethiopian forces depended on foot messengers, as they did not have radio. It was enough for the Italians to impose a narrow fence on Ethiopian detachments to leave them unaware of the movements of their own army. Nazi Germany sent arms and munitions to Ethiopia because it was frustrated over Italian objections to its attempts to integrate Austria. This prolonged the war and sapped Italian resources. It would soon lead to Italy&#x27;s greater economic dependence on Germany and less interventionist policy on Austria, clearing the path for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Anschluss&quot;.

The Ethiopian counteroffensive managed to stop the Italian advance for a few weeks, but the superiority of the Italians&#x27; weapons (particularly heavy artillery and airstrikes with bombs and chemical weapons) prevented the Ethiopians from taking advantage of their initial successes. The Italians resumed the offensive in early March. On 29 March 1936, Graziani bombed the city of Harar and two days later the Italians won a decisive victory in the Battle of Maychew, which nullified any possible organized resistance of the Ethiopians. Emperor Haile Selassie was forced to escape into exile on 2 May, and Badoglio&#x27;s forces arrived in the capital Addis Ababa on 5 May. Italy announced the annexation of the territory of Ethiopia on 7 May and Italian King Victor Emmanuel III was proclaimed emperor on 9 May. The provinces of Eritrea, Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia (Ethiopia) were united to form the Italian province of East Africa. Fighting between Italian and Ethiopian troops persisted until 19 February 1937. On the same day, an attempted assassination of Graziani led to the reprisal Yekatit 12 massacre in Addis Ababa, in which between 1,400 and 30,000 civilians were killed. Italian forces continued to suppress rebel activity by the &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; until 1939.

Italian troops used mustard gas in aerial bombardments (in violation of the Geneva Protocol and Geneva Conventions) against combatants and civilians in an attempt to discourage the Ethiopian people from supporting the resistance. Deliberate Italian attacks against ambulances and hospitals of the Red Cross were reported. By all estimates, hundreds of thousands of Ethiopian civilians died as a result of the Italian invasion, which have been described by some historians as constituting genocide. Crimes by Ethiopian troops included the use of dumdum bullets (in violation of the Hague Conventions), the killing of civilian workmen (including during the Gondrand massacre) and the mutilation of captured Eritrean Ascari and Italians (often with castration), beginning in the first weeks of war.

== Background ==

=== State of East Africa ===

The Kingdom of Italy began its attempts to establish colonies in the Horn of Africa in the 1880s. The first phase of the colonial expansion concluded with the disastrous First Italo-Ethiopian War and the defeat of the Italian forces in the Battle of Adwa, on 1 March 1896, inflicted by the Ethiopian Army of Negus Menelik II. In the following years, Italy abandoned its expansionist plans in the area and limited itself to administering the small possessions that it retained in the area: the colony of Italian Eritrea and the protectorate (later colony) of Italian Somaliland. For the next few decades, Italian-Ethiopian economic and diplomatic relations remained relatively stable.

On 14 December 1925, Italy&#x27;s fascist government signed a secret pact with Britain aimed at reinforcing Italian dominance in the region. London recognised that the area was of Italian interest and agreed to the Italian request to build a railway connecting Somalia and Eritrea. Although the signatories had wished to maintain the secrecy of the agreement, the plan soon leaked and caused indignation by the French and Ethiopian governments. The latter denounced it as a betrayal of a country that had been for all intents and purposes a member of the League of Nations.

As fascist rule in Italy continued to radicalise, its colonial governors in the Horn of Africa began pushing outward the margins of their imperial foothold. The governor of Italian Eritrea, Jacopo Gasparini, focused on the exploitation of Teseney and an attempt to win over the leaders of the Tigre people against Ethiopia. The governor of Italian Somaliland, Cesare Maria de Vecchi, began a policy of repression that led to the occupation of the fertile Jubaland, and the cessation in 1928 of collaboration between the settlers and the traditional Somali chiefs.

=== Walwal Incident ===
The Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 stated that the border between Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was 21 leagues parallel to the Benadir coast (approximately ). In 1930, Italy built a fort at the Welwel oasis (also &quot;Walwal&quot;, Italian: &quot;Ual-Ual&quot;) in the Ogaden and garrisoned it with Somali dubats (irregular frontier troops commanded by Italian officers). The fort at Welwel was well beyond the 21-league limit and inside Ethiopian territory. On 23 November 1934, an Anglo–Ethiopian boundary commission studying grazing grounds to find a definitive border between British Somaliland and Ethiopia arrived at Welwel.

The party contained Ethiopian and British technicians and an escort of around 600 Ethiopian soldiers. Both sides knew that the Italians had installed a military post at Welwel and were not surprised to see an Italian flag at the wells. The Ethiopian government had notified the Italian authorities in Italian Somaliland that the commission was active in the Ogaden and requested the Italians to co-operate. When the British commissioner Lieutenant-Colonel Esmond Clifford, asked the Italians for permission to camp nearby, the Italian commander, Captain Roberto Cimmaruta, rebuffed the request.

Fitorari Shiferra, the commander of the Ethiopian escort, took no notice of the and Somali troops and made camp. To avoid being caught in an Italian–Ethiopian incident, Clifford withdrew the British contingent to Ado, about to the north-east, and Italian aircraft began to fly over Welwel. The Ethiopian commissioners retired with the British, but the escort remained. For ten days both sides exchanged menaces, sometimes no more than 2 m apart. Reinforcements increased the Ethiopian contingent to about 1,500 men and the Italians to about 500, and on 5 December 1934, shots were fired. The Italians were supported by an armoured car and bomber aircraft. The bombs missed, but machine gunfire from the car caused about 110 Ethiopian casualties. 30 to 50 Italians and Somalis were killed. The incident led to the Abyssinia Crisis at the League of Nations. On 4 September 1935, the League of Nations exonerated both parties for the incident.

=== Ethiopian isolation ===

Britain and France, preferring Italy as an ally against Germany, did not take strong steps to discourage an Italian military buildup on the borders of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. Because of the German Question, Mussolini needed to deter Hitler from annexing Austria while much of the Italian Army was being deployed to the Horn of Africa, which led him to draw closer to France to provide the necessary deterrent. King Victor Emmanuel III shared the traditional Italian respect for British sea power and insisted to Mussolini that Italy must not antagonise Britain before he assented to the war. In that regard, British diplomacy in the first half of 1935 greatly assisted Mussolini&#x27;s efforts to win Victor Emmanuel&#x27;s support for the invasion.

On 7 January 1935, a Franco-Italian Agreement was made that gave Italy essentially a free hand in Africa in return for Italian co-operation in Europe. Pierre Laval told Mussolini that he wanted a Franco-Italian alliance against Nazi Germany and that Italy had a &quot;free hand&quot; in Ethiopia. In April, Italy was further emboldened by participation in the Stresa Front, an agreement to curb further German violations of the Treaty of Versailles. The first draft of the communique at Stresa Summit spoke of upholding stability all over the world, but British Foreign Secretary, Sir John Simon, insisted for the final draft to declare that Britain, France and Italy were committed to upholding stability &quot;in Europe&quot;, which Mussolini took for British acceptance of an invasion of Ethiopia. 

In June, non-interference was further assured by a political rift, which had developed between the United Kingdom and France, because of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. As 300,000 Italian soldiers were transferred to Eritrea and Italian Somaliland over the spring and the summer of 1935, the world&#x27;s media was abuzz with speculation that Italy would soon be invading Ethiopia. In June 1935, Anthony Eden arrived in Rome with the message that Britain opposed an invasion and had a compromise plan for Italy to be given a corridor in Ethiopia to link the two Italian colonies in the Horn of Africa, which Mussolini rejected outright. As the Italians had broken the British naval codes, Mussolini knew of the problems in the British Mediterranean Fleet, which led him to believe that the British opposition to the invasion, which had come as an unwelcome surprise to him, was not serious and that Britain would never go to war over Ethiopia.

The prospect that an Italian invasion of Ethiopia would cause a crisis in Anglo-Italian relations was seen as an opportunity in Berlin. Although Hitler did not want to see Haile Selassie win, Germany provided some weapons to Ethiopia out of fear of quick victory for Italy. The German perspective was that if Italy was bogged down in a long war in Ethiopia, that would probably lead to Britain pushing the League of Nations to impose sanctions on Italy, which the French would almost certainly not veto out of fear of destroying relations with Britain; that would cause a crisis in Anglo-Italian relations and allow Germany to offer its &quot;good services&quot; to Italy. In that way, Hitler hoped to win Mussolini as an ally and to destroy the Stresa Front.

A final possible foreign ally of Ethiopia was Japan, which had served as a model to some Ethiopian intellectuals. After the Welwel incident, several right-wing Japanese groups, including the Great Asianism Association and the Black Dragon Society, attempted to raise money for the Ethiopian cause. The Japanese ambassador to Italy, Dr. Sugimura Yotaro, on 16 July assured Mussolini that Japan held no political interests in Ethiopia and would stay neutral in the coming war. His comments stirred up a furor inside Japan, where there had been popular affinity for the fellow nonwhite empire in Africa, which was reciprocated with similar anger in Italy towards Japan combined with praise for Mussolini and his firm stance against the &quot;gialli di Tokyo&quot; (&quot;Tokyo Yellows&quot;). Despite popular opinion, when the Ethiopians approached Japan for help on 2 August, they were refused, and even a modest request for the Japanese government for an official statement of its support for Ethiopia during the coming conflict was denied.

== Armies ==

=== Ethiopian forces ===
With war appearing inevitable, the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie ordered a general mobilisation of the Army of the Ethiopian Empire:

Selassie&#x27;s army consisted of around 500,000 men, some of whom were armed with spears and bows. Other soldiers carried more modern weapons including rifles, but many of them were equipment from before 1900 and so were obsolete. According to Italian estimates, on the eve of hostilities, the Ethiopians had an army of 350,000–760,000 men. Only about 25% of the army had any military training, and the men were armed with a motley collection of 400,000 rifles of every type and in every condition. The Ethiopian Army had about 234 antiquated pieces of artillery mounted on rigid gun carriages as well as a dozen 3.7 cm PaK 35/36 anti-tank guns.

The army had about 800 light Colt and Hotchkiss machine-guns and 250 heavy Vickers and Hotchkiss machine guns, about 100 .303-inch Vickers guns on AA mounts, 48 20 mm Oerlikon S anti-aircraft guns and some recently purchased Canon de 75 CA modèle 1917 Schneider field guns. The arms embargo imposed on the belligerents by France and Britain disproportionately affected Ethiopia, which lacked the manufacturing industry to produce its own weapons. The Ethiopian army had some 300 trucks, seven Ford A-based armoured cars and four World War I era Fiat 3000 tanks.

The best Ethiopian units were the emperor&#x27;s &quot;Kebur Zabagna&quot; (Imperial Guard), which were well-trained and better equipped than the other Ethiopian troops. The Imperial Guard wore a distinctive greenish-khaki uniform of the Belgian Army, which stood out from the white cotton cloak (&quot;shamma&quot;), which was worn by most Ethiopian fighters and proved to be an excellent target. The skills of the &quot;Rases&quot;, the Ethiopian generals armies, were reported to rate from relatively good to incompetent. After Italian objections to the Anschluss, the German annexation of Austria, Germany sent three aeroplanes, 10,000 Mauser rifles and 10 million rounds of ammunition to the Ethiopians.

The serviceable portion of the Ethiopian Air Force was commanded by a Frenchman, André Maillet, and included three obsolete Potez 25 biplanes. A few transport aircraft had been acquired between 1934 and 1935 for ambulance work, but the Air Force had 13 aircraft and four pilots at the outbreak of the war. Airspeed in England had a surplus Viceroy racing plane, and its director, Neville Shute, was delighted with a good offer for the &quot;white elephant&quot; in August 1935. The agent said that it was to fly cinema films around Europe. When the client wanted bomb racks to carry the (flammable) films, Shute agreed to fit lugs under the wings to which they could attach &quot;anything they liked&quot;. He was told that the plane was to be used to bomb the Italian oil storage tanks at Massawa, and when the CID enquired about the alien (ex-German) pilot practices in it Shute got the impression that the Foreign Office did not object. However, fuel, bombs and bomb racks from Finland could not reach Ethiopia in time, and the paid-for Viceroy stayed at its works. The emperor of Ethiopia had £16,000 to spend on modern aircraft to resist the Italians and planned to spend £5000 on the Viceroy and the rest on three Gloster Gladiator fighters.

There were 50 foreign mercenaries who joined the Ethiopian forces, including French pilots like Pierre Corriger, American pilot John Robinson (aviator), the Trinidadian pilot Hubert Julian, an official Swedish military mission under Captain Viking Tamm, the White Russian Feodor Konovalov and the Czechoslovak writer Adolf Parlesak. Several Austrian Nazis, a team of Belgian fascists, and the Cuban mercenary Alejandro del Valle also fought for Haile Selassie. Many of the individuals were military advisers, pilots, doctors or supporters of the Ethiopian cause; 50 mercenaries fought in the Ethiopian army and another 50 people were active in the Ethiopian Red Cross or nonmilitary activities. The Italians later attributed most of the relative success achieved by the Ethiopians to foreigners, or &quot;ferenghi&quot;. (The Italian propaganda machine magnified the number to thousands to explain away the Ethiopian Christmas Offensive in late 1935.)

A former Ottoman general named Wehib Pasha also served as a military advisor with the Ethiopian army during the war, notably designing a defensive line for Ethiopian troops known as the &quot;Hindenburg Wall&quot;, which was broken through by Italian troops during the Battle of the Ogaden in 1936.

=== Italian forces ===
There were 400,000 Italian soldiers in Eritrea and 285,000 in Italian Somaliland with 3,300 machine guns, 275 artillery pieces, 200 tankettes and 205 aircraft. In April 1935, the reinforcement of the Royal Italian Army (&quot;Regio Esercito&quot;) and the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Royal Air Force) in East Africa (&quot;Africa Orientale&quot;) accelerated. Eight regular, mountain and blackshirt militia infantry divisions arrived in Eritrea, and four regular infantry divisions arrived in Italian Somaliland, about 685,000 soldiers and a great number of logistical and support units; the Italians included 200 journalists. The Italians had 6,000 machine guns, 2,000 pieces of artillery, 599 tanks and 390 aircraft. The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) carried tons of ammunition, food and other supplies, with the motor vehicles to move them, but the Ethiopians had only horse-drawn carts.

The Italians placed considerable reliance on their Corps of Colonial Troops (&quot;Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali&quot;, RCTC) of indigenous regiments recruited from the Italian colonies of Eritrea, Somalia and Libya. The most effective of the Italian commanded units were the Eritrean native infantry (&quot;Ascari&quot;), which was often used as advanced troops. The Eritreans also provided cavalry and artillery units; the &quot;Falcon Feathers&quot; (&quot;Penne di Falco&quot;) was one prestigious and colourful Eritrean cavalry unit. Other RCTC units during the invasion of Ethiopia were irregular Somali frontier troops (&quot;dubats&quot;), regular Arab-Somali infantry and artillery and infantry from Libya. 

The Italians had a variety of local semi-independent &quot;allies&quot; in the north, and the Azebu Galla were among several groups induced to fight for the Italians. In the south, the Somali sultan Olol Dinle commanded a personal army, which advanced into the northern Ogaden with the forces of Colonel Luigi Frusci. The sultan was motivated by his desire to take back lands that the Ethiopians had taken from him. The Italian colonial forces even included men from Yemen, across the Gulf of Aden.

The Italians were reinforced by volunteers from the so-called &quot;Italiani all&#x27;estero&quot;, members of the Italian diaspora from Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil; they formed the 221st Legion in the &quot;Divisione Tevere&quot;, which a special &quot;Legione Parini&quot; fought under Frusci near Dire Dawa. On 28 March 1935, General Emilio De Bono was named the commander-in-chief of all Italian armed forces in East Africa. De Bono was also the commander-in-chief of the forces invading from Eritrea on the northern front. De Bono commanded nine divisions in the Italian I Corps, the Italian II Corps and the Eritrean Corps. General Rodolfo Graziani was commander-in-chief of forces invading from Italian Somaliland on the southern front.

Initially, he had two divisions and a variety of smaller units under his command: a mixture of Italians, Somalis, Eritreans, Libyans and others. De Bono regarded Italian Somaliland as a secondary theatre, whose primary need was to defend itself, but it could aid the main front with offensive thrusts if the enemy forces were not too large there. Most foreigners accompanied the Ethiopians, but Herbert Matthews, a reporter and historian who wrote &quot;Eyewitness in Abyssinia: With Marshal Bodoglio&#x27;s forces to Addis Ababa&quot; (1937), and Pedro del Valle, an observer for US Marine Corps, accompanied the Italian forces.

== Hostilities ==

=== Italian invasion ===

At 5:00 am on 3 October 1935, De Bono crossed the Mareb River and advanced into Ethiopia from Eritrea without a declaration of war. Aircraft of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; scattered leaflets asking the population to rebel against Haile Selassie and support the &quot;true Emperor Iyasu V&quot;. Forty-year-old Iyasu had been deposed many years earlier but was still in custody. In response to the Italian invasion, Ethiopia declared war on Italy. 

At this point in the campaign, the lack of roads represented a serious hindrance for the Italians as they crossed into Ethiopia. On the Eritrean side, roads had been constructed right up to the border. On the Ethiopian side, these roads often transitioned into vaguely defined paths, and the Italian army used aerial photography to plan its advance, as well as mustard gas attacks. 

On 5 October the Italian I Corps took Adigrat, and by 6 October, Adwa (Adowa) was captured by the Italian II Corps. Haile Selassie had ordered Duke (&quot;Ras&quot;) Seyoum Mangasha, the Commander of the Ethiopian Army of Tigre, to withdraw a day&#x27;s march away from the Mareb River. Later, the Emperor ordered his son-in-law and Commander of the Gate (&quot;Dejazmach&quot;) Haile Selassie Gugsa, also in the area, to move back from the border.

On 11 October, Gugsa surrendered with 1,200 followers at the Italian outpost at Adagamos. Italian propagandists lavishly publicised the surrender but fewer than a tenth of Gugsa&#x27;s men defected with him. On 14 October, De Bono proclaimed the end of slavery in Ethiopia but this liberated the former slave owners from the obligation to feed their former slaves, in the unsettled conditions caused by the war. Much of the livestock in the area had been moved to the south to feed the Ethiopian army and many of the emancipated people had no choice but to appeal to the Italian authorities for food. 

By 15 October, De Bono&#x27;s forces had advanced from Adwa and occupied the holy capital of Axum. De Bono entered the city riding on a white horse and then looted the Obelisk of Axum. To Mussolini&#x27;s dismay, the advance was methodical and on 8 November, the I Corps and the Eritrean Corps captured Makale. The Italian advance had added to the line of supply and De Bono wanted to build a road from Adigrat before continuing. On 16 November, De Bono was promoted to the rank of Marshal of Italy (&quot;Maresciallo d&#x27;Italia&quot;) and in December was replaced by Badoglio to speed up the invasion.

=== Hoare–Laval Pact ===

On 14 November 1935, the National government in Britain, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, won a general election on a platform of upholding collective security and support for the League of Nations, which at least implied that Britain would support Ethiopia. However, the British service chiefs, led by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Earle Chatfield, all advised against going to war with Italy for the sake of Ethiopia, which carried much weight with the cabinet. During the 1935 election, Baldwin and the rest of the cabinet had repeatedly promised that Britain was committed to upholding collective security in the belief of that being the best way to neutralise the Labour Party, which also ran on a platform emphasising collective security and support for the League of Nations. To square the circle caused by its election promises and its desire to avoid offending Mussolini too much, the cabinet decided upon a plan to give most of Ethiopia to Italy, with the rest in the Italian sphere of influence, as the best way of ending the war.

In early December 1935, the Hoare–Laval Pact was proposed by Britain and France. Italy would gain the best parts of Ogaden and Tigray and economic influence over all the south. Abyssinia would have a guaranteed corridor to the sea at the port of Assab; the corridor was a poor one and known as a &quot;corridor for camels&quot;. Mussolini was ready to play along with considering the Hoare-Laval Pact, rather than rejecting it outright, to avoid a complete break with Britain and France, but he kept demanding changes to the plan before he would accept it as a way to stall for more time to allow his army to conquer Ethiopia. Mussolini was not prepared to abandon the goal of conquering Ethiopia, but the imposition of League of Nations sanctions on Italy caused much alarm in Rome. 

The war was wildly popular with the Italian people, who relished Mussolini&#x27;s defiance of the League as an example of Italian greatness. Even if Mussolini had been willing to stop the war, the move would have been very unpopular in Italy. Kallis wrote, &quot;Especially after the imposition of sanctions in November 1935, the popularity of the Fascist regime reached unprecedented heights&quot;. On 13 December, details of the pact were leaked by a French newspaper and denounced as a sellout of the Ethiopians. The British government disassociated itself from the pact and British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare was forced to resign in disgrace.

=== Ethiopian Christmas Offensive ===
The Christmas Offensive was intended to split the Italian forces in the north with the Ethiopian centre, crushing the Italian left with the Ethiopian right and to invade Eritrea with the Ethiopian left. &quot;Ras&quot; Seyum Mangasha held the area around Abiy Addi with about 30,000 men. Selassie with about 40,000 men advanced from Gojjam toward Mai Timket to the left of &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum. &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa Haile Darge with around 40,000 men advanced from Dessie to support &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum in the centre in a push towards Warieu Pass. &quot;Ras&quot; Mulugeta Yeggazu, the Minister of War, advanced from Dessie with approximately 80,000 men to take positions on and around Amba Aradam to the right of &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum. Amba Aradam was a steep sided, flat topped mountain directly in the way of an Italian advance on Addis Ababa. The four commanders had approximately 190,000 men facing the Italians. &quot;Ras&quot; Imru and his Army of Shire were on the Ethiopian left. &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum and his Army of Tigre and &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa and his Army of Beghemder were the Ethiopian centre. &quot;Ras&quot; Mulugeta and his &quot;Army of the Center&quot; (&quot;Mahel Sefari&quot;) were on the Ethiopian right.

A force of 1,000 Ethiopians crossed the Tekeze river and advanced toward the Dembeguina Pass (Inda Aba Guna or Indabaguna pass). The Italian commander, Major Criniti, commanded a force of 1,000 Eritrean infantry supported by L3 tanks. When the Ethiopians attacked, the Italian force fell back to the pass, only to discover that 2,000 Ethiopian soldiers were already there and Criniti&#x27;s force was encircled. In the first Ethiopian attack, two Italian officers were killed and Criniti was wounded.

The Italians tried to break out using their L3 tanks but the rough terrain immobilised the vehicles. The Ethiopians killed the infantry, then rushed the tanks and killed their two-man crews. Italian forces organised a relief column made up of tanks and infantry to relieve Critini but it was ambushed en route. Ethiopians on the high ground rolled boulders in front of and behind several of the tanks, to immobilise them, picked off the Eritrean infantry and swarmed the tanks.

The other tanks were immobilised by the terrain, unable to advance further and two were set on fire. Critini managed to break-out in a bayonet charge and half escaped. Italian casualties were 31 Italians and 370 Askari killed and five Italians taken prisoner; Ethiopian casualties were estimated by the Italians to be 500, which was probably greatly exaggerated.

The news from the &quot;northern front&quot; was generally bad for Italy. However, foreign correspondents in Addis Ababa publicly took up knitting to mock their lack of access to the front. There was no way for them to verify reports that 4,700 Italians had been captured. The correspondents were told by the Ethiopians that Italian tanks had been stranded and abandoned and that Italian native troops were mutinying. Later, a report was issued that Ethiopian warriors had captured eighteen tanks, thirty-three field guns, 175 machine guns, and 2,605 rifles. In addition, this report indicated that the Ethiopians had wiped out an entire legion of the 2nd CC.NN. Division &quot;28 Ottobre&quot; and that the Italians had lost at least 3,000 men. Rome denied these figures.

The ambitious Ethiopian plan called for &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa and &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum to split the Italian army in two and isolate the Italian I Corps and III Corps in Mekele. &quot;Ras&quot; Mulugeta would then descend from Amba Aradam and crush both corps. According to this plan, after &quot;Ras&quot; Imru retook Adwa, he was to invade Eritrea. In November, the League of Nations condemned Italy&#x27;s aggression and imposed economic sanctions. This excluded oil, however, an indispensable raw material for the conduct of any modern military campaign, and this favoured Italy.

The Ethiopian counteroffensive managed to stop the Italian advance for a few weeks, but the superiority of the Italian&#x27;s weaponry (artillery and machine guns) as well as aerial bombardment with chemical weapons, at first with mustard gas prevented the Ethiopians from taking advantage of their initial successes. The Ethiopians in general were very poorly armed, with few machine guns, their troops mainly armed with swords and spears. Having spent a decade accumulating poison gas in East Africa, Mussolini gave Badoglio authority to resort to &quot;Schrecklichkeit&quot; (frightfulness), which included destroying villages and using gas (OC 23/06, 28 December 1935). Mussolini was even prepared to resort to bacteriological warfare as long as these methods could be kept quiet. Some Italians objected when they found out but the practices were kept secret, the government issuing denials or spurious stories blaming the Ethiopians.

=== Second Italian advance ===

As the progress of the Christmas Offensive slowed, Italian plans to renew the advance on the northern front began as Mussolini had given permission to use poison gas (but not mustard gas) and Badoglio received the Italian III Corps and the Italian IV Corps in Eritrea during early 1936. On 20 January, the Italians resumed their northern offensive at the First Battle of Tembien (20 to 24 January) in the broken terrain between the Warieu Pass and Makale. The forces of Ras Kassa were defeated, the Italians using phosgene gas and suffering 1,082 casualties against 8,000 Ethiopian casualties according to an Ethiopian wireless message intercepted by the Italians.

From 10 to 19 February, the Italians captured Amba Aradam and destroyed &quot;Ras&quot; Mulugeta&#x27;s army in the Battle of Amba Aradam (Battle of Enderta). The Ethiopians suffered massive losses and poison gas destroyed a small part of &quot;Ras&quot; Mulugeta&#x27;s army, according to the Ethiopians. During the slaughter following the attempted withdrawal of his army, both &quot;Ras&quot; Mulugeta and his son were killed. The Italians lost 800 killed and wounded while the Ethiopians lost 6,000 killed and 12,000 wounded. From 27 to 29 February, the armies of &quot;Ras&quot; Kassa and &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum were destroyed at the Second Battle of Tembien. Ethiopians again argued that poison gas played a role in the destruction of the withdrawing armies.

In early March, the army of &quot;Ras&quot; Imru was attacked, bombed and defeated in what was known as the Battle of Shire. In the battles of Amba Aradam, Tembien and Shire, the Italians suffered about 2,600 casualties and the Ethiopians about 15,000; Italian casualties at the Battle of Shire being 969 men. The Italian victories stripped the Ethiopian defences on the northern front, Tigré province had fallen most of the Ethiopian survivors returned home or took refuge in the countryside and only the army guarding Addis Ababa stood between the Italians and the rest of the country.
On 31 March 1936 at the Battle of Maychew, the Italians defeated an Ethiopian counter-offensive by the main Ethiopian army commanded by Selassie. The Ethiopians launched near non-stop attacks on the Italian and Eritrean defenders but could not overcome the well-prepared Italian defences. When the exhausted Ethiopians withdrew, the Italians counter-attacked. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; attacked the survivors at Lake Ashangi with mustard gas. The Italian troops had 400 casualties, the Eritreans 874 and the Ethiopians suffered 8,900 casualties from 31,000 men present according to an Italian estimate. On 4 April, Selassie looked with despair upon the horrific sight of the dead bodies of his army ringing the poisoned lake. 

Following the battle, Ethiopian soldiers began to employ guerrilla tactics against the Italians, initiating a trend of resistance that would transform into the Patriot/&quot;Arbegnoch&quot; movement. They were joined by local residents who operated independently near their own homes. Early activities included capturing war materials, rolling boulders off cliffs at passing convoys, kidnapping messengers, cutting telephone lines, setting fire to administrative offices and fuel and ammunition dumps, and killing collaborators. As disruption increased, the Italians were forced to redeploy more troops to Tigre, away from the campaign further south.

=== Southern front ===

On 3 October 1935, Graziani implemented the Milan Plan to remove Ethiopian forces from various frontier posts and to test the reaction to a series of probes all along the southern front. While incessant rains worked to hinder the plan, within three weeks the Somali villages of Kelafo, Dagnerai, Gerlogubi and Gorahai in Ogaden were in Italian hands. Late in the year, &quot;Ras&quot; Desta Damtu assembled up his army in the area around Negele Borana, to advance on Dolo and invade Italian Somaliland. Between 12 and 16 January 1936, the Italians defeated the Ethiopians at the Battle of Genale Doria. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; destroyed the army of &quot;Ras&quot; Desta, Ethiopians claiming that poison gas was used.

After a lull in February 1936, the Italians in the south prepared an advance towards the city of Harar. On 22 March, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; bombed Harar and Jijiga, reducing them to ruins even though Harar had been declared an &quot;open city&quot;. On 14 April, Graziani launched his attack against &quot;Ras&quot; Nasibu Emmanual to defeat the last Ethiopian army in the field at the Battle of the Ogaden. The Ethiopians were drawn up behind a defensive line that was termed the &quot;Hindenburg Wall&quot;, designed by the chief of staff of Ras Nasibu, and Wehib Pasha, a seasoned ex-Ottoman commander. After ten days, the last Ethiopian army had disintegrated; 2,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 Ethiopian soldiers were killed or wounded.

=== Fall of Addis Ababa ===

On 26 April 1936, Badoglio began the &quot;March of the Iron Will&quot; from Dessie to Addis Ababa, an advance with a mechanised column against slight Ethiopian resistance. The column experienced a more serious attack on 4 May when Ethiopian forces under Haile Mariam Mammo ambushed the formation in Chacha, near Debre Berhan, killing approximately 170 colonial troops.

Meanwhile, Selassie conducted a disorganized retreat towards the capital. There, government officials operated without leadership, unable to contact the Emperor and unsure of his whereabouts. Realizing that Addis Ababa would soon fall to the Italians, Ethiopian administrators met to discuss a possible evacuation of the government to the west. After several days, they decided that they should relocate to Gore, though actual preparations for their departure were postponed. Addis Ababa became crowded with retreating soldiers from the front while its foreign residents sought refuge at various European legations. Selassie reached the capital on 30 April. That day his Council of Ministers resolved that the city should be defended and a retreat to Gore conducted only as a last resort. 

The following day an ad hoc council of Ethiopian nobles convened to re-examine the decision, where Ras Aberra Kassa suggested that the Emperor should go to Geneva to appeal to the League of Nations for assistance before returning to lead resistance against the Italians. The view was subsequently adopted by Selassie and preparations were made for his departure. On 2 May, Selassie boarded a train from Addis Ababa to Djibouti, with the gold of the Ethiopian Central Bank. From there he fled to the United Kingdom, with the tacit acquiescence of the Italians who could have bombed his train, into exile (Mussolini had refused a request from Graziani to mount such an attack.)

Before he departed, Selassie ordered that the government of Ethiopia be moved to Gore and directed the mayor of Addis Ababa to maintain order in the city until the Italians&#x27; arrival. Imru Haile Selassie was appointed Prince Regent during his absence. The city police, under Abebe Aregai and the remainder of the Imperial Guard did their utmost to restrain a growing crowd but rioters rampaged throughout the city, looting and setting fire to shops owned by Europeans. Most of the violence occurred between looters, fighting over the spoils and by 5 May, much of the city lay in ruins. At 04:00 Badoglio drove into the city at the head of 1,600 lorries and patrols of Italian tanks, troops and Carabinieri were sent to occupy tactically valuable areas in the city, as the remaining inhabitants watched sullenly.

=== Subsequent operations ===
After the occupation of Addis Ababa, nearly half of Ethiopia was still unoccupied and the fighting continued for another three years until nearly 90% was &quot;pacified&quot; just before World War II, although censorship kept this from the Italian public. Ethiopian commanders withdrew to nearby areas to regroup; Abebe Aregai went to Ankober, Balcha Safo to Gurage, Zewdu Asfaw to Mulo, Blatta Takale Wolde Hawariat to Limmu and the Kassa brothers—Aberra, Wondosson and Asfawossen—to Selale. Haile Mariam conducted hit-and-run attacks around the capital. About 10,000 troops remaining under the command of Aberra Kassa had orders from Selassie to continue resistance. On 10 May 1936, Italian troops from the northern front and from the southern front met at Dire Dawa. The Italians found the recently released Ethiopian Ras, Hailu Tekle Haymanot, who boarded a train back to Addis Ababa and approached the Italian invaders in submission. Imru Haile Selassie fell back to Gore in southern Ethiopia to reorganise and continue to resist the Italians. In early June, the Italian government promulgated a constitution for &quot;Africa Orientale Italiana&quot; (AOI, Italian East Africa) bringing Ethiopia, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland together into an administrative unit of six provinces. Badoglio became the first Viceroy and Governor General but on 11 June, he was replaced by Marshal Graziani.

On 21 June Kassa held a meeting with Bishop Abune Petros and several other Patriot leaders at Debre Libanos, about north of Addis Ababa. Plans were made to storm parts of the capital but a lack of transport and radio equipment prevented a co-ordinated attack. In July, Ethiopian forces attacked Addis Ababa and were routed. Numerous members of Ethiopian royalty were taken prisoner and others were executed soon after they surrendered. The exiled government in Gore was never able to provide any meaningful leadership to the Patriots or remaining military formations but sporadic resistance by independent groups persisted around the capital.

On the night 26 June, members of the Black Lions organization destroyed three Italian aircraft in Nekemte and killed twelve Italian officials, including Air Marshal Vincenzo Magliocco and aviator Antonio Locatelli, after the Italians had sent the party to parley with the local populace. Graziani ordered the town to be bombed in retaliation for the killings (Magliocco was his deputy). Local hostility forced out the Patriots and Desta Damtew, commander of the southern Patriots, withdrew his troops to Arbegona. Surrounded by Italian forces, they retreated to Butajira, where they were eventually defeated. An estimated 4,000 Patriots were reportedly killed in both engagements, 1,600 of whom—including Damtew—after being taken prisoner. On 19 December, Wondosson Kassa was executed near Debre Zebit and on 21 December, Aberra Kassa and Asfawossen Kassa were executed in Fikke. In late 1936, after the Italians tracked him down in Gurage, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Balcha Safo was killed in battle. On 19 December, Ras Imru surrendered at the Gojeb river.

After the end of the rainy season, an Italian column left Addis Ababa in September and occupied Gore a month later. The forces of &quot;Ras&quot; Imru were trapped between the Italians and the Sudan border and Imru surrendered on 19 December. Imru was flown to Italy and imprisoned on the Island of Ponza, while the rest of the Ethiopian prisoners taken in the war were dispersed in camps in East Africa and Italy. A second column went south-west to attack &quot;Ras&quot; Desta and the &quot;Dejasmatch&quot; Gabre Mariam who had assembled military forces in the Great Lakes district. The Ethiopians were defeated on 16 December and by January, the Italians had established a measure of control over the provinces of Jimma, Kafa and Arusi. After another two months, the remaining Ethiopians were surrounded and fought on, rather than surrender. Mariam was killed. On 19 February 1937 the last battle of the war occurred when remnants of the Armies of Sidamo and Bale clashed with Italian forces at Gogetti, and were defeated.

=== Addis Ababa massacre ===

That same date, 19 February 1937 – Yekatit 12 according to the Ge&#x27;ez calendar – saw the attempted assassination of Marshal Graziani by Eritrean rebels Abraham Deboch and Mogos Asgedom in Addis Ababa. The campaign of reprisals visited by the Italians upon the population of Addis Ababa has been described as the worst massacre in Ethiopian history. Estimates vary on the number of people killed in the three days that followed the attempt on Graziani&#x27;s life. Ethiopian sources estimated that 30,000 people were killed by the Italians, while Italian sources claimed that only a few hundred were killed. A 2017 history of the massacre estimated that 19,200 people were killed, 20 percent of the population of Addis Ababa. Over the following week, numerous Ethiopians suspected of opposing Italian rule were rounded up and executed, including members of the Black Lions and other members of the aristocracy. Many more were imprisoned, even collaborators such as &quot;Ras&quot; Gebre Haywot, the son of &quot;Ras&quot; Mikael of Wollo, Brehane Markos, and Ayale Gebre, who had helped the Italians identify the two men who made the attempt on Graziani&#x27;s life.

According to Mockler, &quot;Italian &quot;carabinieri&quot; had fired into the crowds of beggars and poor assembled for the distribution of alms; and it is said that the Federal Secretary, Guido Cortese, even fired his revolver into the group of Ethiopian dignitaries standing around him.&quot; Hours later, Cortese gave the fatal order:Comrades, today is the day when we should show our devotion to our Viceroy by reacting and destroying the Ethiopians for three days. For three days I give you &quot;carte blanche&quot; to destroy and kill and do what you want to the Ethiopians. Italians doused native houses with petrol and set them on fire. They broke into the homes of local Greeks and Armenians and lynched their servants. Some even posed on the corpses of their victims to have their photographs taken. The first day of the massacre has been commemorated as &quot;Yekatit 12&quot; (19 February) by Ethiopians ever since. There is a Yekatit 12 monument in Addis Ababa in memory of these Ethiopian victims of Italian aggression.

=== Casualties ===

In 1968, Colonel A. J. Barker wrote that from 1 January 1935 to 31 May 1936, the Italian army and Blackshirt units lost killed, died of wounds and thirty-one missing; about troops and workmen were also killed, a total of In a 1978 publication, Alberto Sbacchi wrote that these official Italian casualty figures of about an underestimate. Sbacchi wrote that the official total of Italian casualties was unreliable, because the regime desired to underestimate Italian losses. Del Boca estimates the total Italian losses up to 31 December 1936 (including more than six months of guerrilla warfare after the end of the conflict) speak of 2,317 dead for the Italian army, 1,165 for the Blackshirts, 193 from the air force, 56 from the navy, 78 civilians in the Gondrand shipyard massacre, 453 factory workers and 88 merchant marines, for a total of 4,350 Italians killed. To these figures must be added approximately 9,000 injured and 18,200 repatriated due to illness. Estimates on the losses of the askaris, however very vague, he puts it at 4,500 killed. From 1936 to 1940, there was an additional killed and and wounded. Total Italian casualties from 1935 to 1940 according to these calculations were about 208,000 killed or wounded. Based on killed in the first six months of 1940, Ministry of Africa figures for 6 May 1936 to 10 June 1940 are killed, which Sbacchi considered to be fairly accurate. 

There was a lack of reliable statistics because confusion during the invasion made it difficult to keep accurate records and the &quot;Statistical Bulletin&quot; had ceased to provide data on fatalities. Field hospital records had been destroyed, inventories dispersed, individual deaths were not reported and bodies were not repatriated to Italy. Unpublished reports listed and civilian fatalities among and from May 1936 to June 1940, there were another and civilian fatalities in . The Italian estimation of Ethiopian losses are killed in the Northern front and killed in the Southern front for a total of . Conversely, in a memorandum submitted to the Paris conference in 1946, the Ethiopian government enumerated killed in action, killed in hostilities during the occupation from 1936 to 1941, and children killed by bombing, killed in the massacre of February 1937, died in concentration camps, killed in obedience to orders from summary courts, died after their villages had been destroyed, a total of However, Del Boca claims that these figures are unreliable and were likely exaggerated to extract more reparations. He asserts that the Italian estimation is more accurate.

== War crimes ==

Italian military forces used between 300 and 500 tons of mustard gas to attack both military and civilian targets, despite being a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the practice. This gas had been produced during World War I and subsequently transported to East Africa. J. F. C. Fuller, who was present in Ethiopia during the conflict, stated that mustard gas &quot;was the decisive tactical factor in the war.&quot; Historian Walter Laqueur estimates that up to one-third of Ethiopian casualties of the war were caused by chemical weapons.

The Italians claimed that their use of gas was justified by the execution of Tito Minniti and his observer in Ogaden by Ethiopian forces. However, the use of gas was authorized by Mussolini nearly two months before Minniti&#x27;s death on 26 December 1935, as evinced by the following order:

After Minniti&#x27;s death, the order was expanded to use of gas &quot;on a vast scale&quot;:

Military and civilian targets were gas bombed and on 30 December, a Red Cross unit was bombed at Dolo and an Egyptian ambulance was attacked at Bulale; a few days later an Egyptian medical unit was bombed at Daggah Bur. There were more attacks in January and February, then on 4 March 1936, a British Red Cross camp near Quoram appeared to be subject to the most deliberate attack of all, when low-flying Italian aircraft crews could not have missed the big Red Cross signs. Mustard gas was also sprayed from above on Ethiopian combatants and villages. The Italians tried to keep their resort to chemical warfare secret but were exposed by the International Red Cross and many foreign observers. The Italians claimed that at least 19 bombardments of Red Cross tents &quot;posted in the areas of military encampment of the Ethiopian resistance&quot;, had been &quot;erroneous&quot;.

The Italians delivered poison gas by gas shell and in bombs dropped by the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;. Though poorly equipped, the Ethiopians had achieved some success against modern weaponry but had no defence against the &quot;terrible rain that burned and killed&quot;. 

In general, historians concluded that the use of chemical weapons was effective and devastating to morale and manpower, though some disagree and argue that they had negligible effect in battle. Historian Angelo Del Boca condemned the use of gas, but argued that it had only a minimal effect on Italian war aims. An analysis by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute argued that the use of chemical weapons shifted the war in favor of the Italians, and dealt a major blow to Ethiopian morale.

American and British military analysis came to similar conclusions. The US military concluded that &quot;Chemical weapons were devastating against the unprepared and unprotected Ethiopians.&quot; British Major General J. F. C. Fuller, assigned to the Italian army, noted that &quot;In place of the laborious process of picketing the heights, the heights sprayed with gas were rendered unoccupiable by the enemy, save at the gravest risk. It was an exceedingly cunning use of this chemical.&quot;

Haile Selassie in his report to the League of Nations described it:

Ethiopian troops used Dum-Dum bullets, which had been banned by declaration IV, 3 of the Hague Convention (1899) and began mutilating captured Eritrean Askari (often with castration) beginning in the first weeks of war. Some hundreds of colonial Eritrean Ascari and dozens of Italians suffered these amputations, often done before death as allegedly happened to 17 Italian workers emasculated in Gondrand in February 1936.

== Public and international reaction ==
Italy&#x27;s military victory overshadowed concerns about the economy. Mussolini was at the height of his popularity in May 1936 with the proclamation of the Italian empire. His biographer, Renzo De Felice, called the war &quot;Mussolini&#x27;s masterpiece&quot; as for a brief moment he had been able to create something resembling a national consensus both in favor of himself and his regime. When Badoglio returned to Italy, he received a snub, as Mussolini made certain that the honours bestowed on Badoglio received fell short of those granted to an Italian &quot;national hero&quot;, in order to present the victory as an achievement of the Fascist system rather than as an achievement of the traditional Italian elites, of which Badoglio was a member. A sign of Mussolini&#x27;s increased power and popularity after the war was his creation of a new military rank; First Marshal of the Italian Empire, to which he promoted both himself and King Victor Emmanuel III, thus putting the prime minister on a theoretical level of equality with the king.
Haile Selassie sailed from Djibouti in the British cruiser . From Mandatory Palestine Selassie sailed to Gibraltar en route to Britain. While still in Jerusalem, Haile Selassie sent a telegram to the League of Nations:

The Ethiopian Emperor&#x27;s telegram caused several nations to temporarily defer recognition of the Italian conquest.

On 30 June, Selassie spoke at the League of Nations and was introduced by the President of the Assembly as &quot;His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia&quot; (&quot;Sa Majesté Imperiale, l&#x27;Empereur d&#x27;Ethiopie&quot;). A group of jeering Italian journalists began yelling insults and were expelled before he could speak. In response, the Romanian chairman, Nicolae Titulescu, jumped to his feet and shouted &quot;Show the savages the door!&quot; (&quot;À la porte les sauvages!&quot;). Selassie denounced Italian aggression and criticised the world community for standing by. At the conclusion of his speech, which appeared on newsreels throughout the world, he said &quot;It is us today. It will be you tomorrow&quot;. France appeased Italy because it could not afford to risk an alliance between Italy and Germany; Britain decided that its military weakness meant that it had to follow France&#x27;s lead. Selassie&#x27;s resolution to the League to deny recognition of the Italian conquest was defeated and he was denied a loan to finance a resistance movement. On 4 July 1936, the League voted to end the sanctions imposed against Italy in November 1935. By 15 July, the sanctions were at an end.

On 18 November 1936, the Italian Empire was recognised by the Empire of Japan and Italy recognised the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, marking the end of the Stresa Front. Hitler had supplied the Ethiopians with 16,000 rifles and 600 machine guns in the hope that Italy would be weakened when he moved against Austria. By contrast, France and Britain recognised Italian control over Ethiopia in 1938. Mexico was the only country to strongly condemn Italy&#x27;s sovereignty over Ethiopia, respecting Ethiopian independence throughout. Including Mexico, only six nations in 1937 did not recognise the Italian occupation: China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, Republican Spain and the United States. Three years later, only the USSR officially recognised Selassie and the United States government considered recognising the Italian Empire with Ethiopia included. The invasion of Ethiopia and its general condemnation by Western democracies isolated Mussolini and Fascist Italy until 1938. From 1936 to 1939, Mussolini and Hitler joined forces to support the fascist camp during the Spanish Civil War. In April 1939, Mussolini launched the Italian invasion of Albania. In May, Italy and Nazi Germany joined in the Pact of Steel. In September 1940, both nations signed the Tripartite Pact along with the Empire of Japan.
==Aftermath==

=== 1936–1940 ===

On 10 May 1936, Italian troops from the northern front and from the southern front met at Dire Dawa. The Italians found the recently released Ethiopian Ras, Hailu Tekle Haymanot, who boarded a train back to Addis Ababa and approached the Italian invaders in submission. On 21 December 1937, Rome appointed Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta, as the new Viceroy and Governor General of Italian East Africa with instructions to take a more conciliatory line.
Aosta instituted public works projects including of new paved roadways, 25 hospitals, 14 hotels, dozens of post offices, telephone exchanges, aqueducts, schools and shops. The Italians decreed miscegenation to be illegal. Racial separation, including residential segregation, was enforced as thoroughly as possible and the Italians showed favouritism to non-Christian groups.

To isolate the dominant Amhara rulers of Ethiopia, who supported Selassie, the Italians granted the Oromos, the Somalis and other Muslims, many of whom had supported the invasion, autonomy and rights. The Italians also definitively abolished slavery and abrogated feudal laws that had been upheld by the Amharas. Early in 1938, a revolt broke out in Gojjam, led by the Committee of Unity and Collaboration, made up of some of the young, educated elite who had escaped reprisals after the assassination attempt on Graziani. The general oversaw another wave of reprisals and had all Ethiopians in administrative jobs murdered, some by being thrown from aircraft, after being taken on board under the pretext of visiting the King in Rome, leading to the saying &quot;He went to Rome&quot;.
The army of occupation had 150,000 men but was spread thinly; by 1941 the garrison had been increased to 250,000 soldiers, including 75,000 Italian civilians. The former police chief of Addis Ababa, Abebe Aregai, was the most successful leader of the Ethiopian guerrilla movement after 1937, using units of fifty men. On 11 December, the League of Nations voted to condemn Italy and Mussolini withdrew from the League. Along with world condemnation, the occupation was expensive, the budget for AOI from 1936 to 1937 required 19,136 billion lire for infrastructure, when the annual revenue of Italy was only 18,581 billion lire.

=== East African campaign, 1940–1941 ===

While in exile in United Kingdom, Haile Selassie had sought the support of the Western democracies for his cause but had little success until the Second World War began. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on France and Britain and attacked British and Commonwealth forces in Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and British Somaliland. In August 1940, the Italian conquest of British Somaliland was completed. The British and Selassie incited Ethiopian and other local forces to join a campaign to dislodge the Italians from Ethiopia. Selassie went to Khartoum to establish closer liaison with the British and resistance forces within Ethiopia. On 18 January 1941, Selassie crossed the border into Ethiopia near the village of Um Iddla and two days later rendezvoused with Gideon Force. The Allied East Africa Command and Ethiopian patriots had largely succeeded in their operations by 6 April 1941, when Addis Ababa was occupied by Harry Wetherall, Dan Pienaar and Charles Christopher Fowkes, who received the surrender of the city; on 5 May, exactly five years after the fall of the capital, Selassie made a formal entry in Addis Ababa. After the Italian defeat, the Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia was carried out by remnants of Italian troops and their allies, which lasted until the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in September 1943.

=== Peace treaty, 1947 ===
The treaty signed in Paris by the Italian Republic (&quot;Repubblica Italiana&quot;) and the victorious powers of World War II on 10 February 1947, included formal Italian recognition of Ethiopian independence and an agreement to pay $25,000,000 () in reparations. Since the League of Nations and most of its members had never officially recognized Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia, Haile Selassie had been recognized as the restored emperor of Ethiopia following his formal entry into Addis Ababa in May 1941. Ethiopia presented a bill to the Economic Commission for Italy of £184,746,023 for damages inflicted during the course of the Italian occupation. The list included the destruction of the slaughter or theft of and goats, and mules and

<text>The World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) is an international Buddhist organization. Initiated by Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera, it was founded in 1950 in Colombo, Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), by representatives from 27 nations. Although Theravada Buddhists are prominent in the organization, (its headquarters are in Thailand and all of its presidents have been from Sri Lanka or southeast Asia), members of all Buddhist schools are active in the WFB. It has regional centers in more than 30 countries, including India, the United States, Australia, and several nations of Africa and Europe, in addition to traditional Buddhist countries.

The aims and objectives of the World Fellowship of Buddhists are:
#To promote among the members strict observance and practice of the teachings of the Buddha
#To secure unity, solidarity, and brotherhood amongst Buddhists
#To propagate the sublime doctrine of the Buddha
#To organize and carry on activities in the field of social, educational, cultural and other humanitarian services
#To work for happiness, harmony and peace on earth and to collaborate with other organizations working for the same ends.

The current president is Phan Wannamethee of Thailand serving since 1999, while Venerable Hsing Yun of the Republic of China (Taiwan) served as honorary president.

<text>is a &quot;wagashi&quot; (Japanese sweet). It resembles a dried persimmon, and is now made by filling gyūhi (a soft form of mochi) with bean jam, then sprinkling white sugar over it.

In the time when sugar was an expensive rarity, dried persimmon, made by drying astringent persimmons (Japanese: &quot;shibugaki&quot;), was a precious sweetener, and it was very commonly used in many households. At that time, &quot;wagashi&quot; was made to showcase this fine fruit, and since then it has become one of the most familiar &quot;wagashi&quot; in Japan.

<text>Circular breathing is a breathing technique used by players of some wind instruments to produce a continuous tone without interruption. It is accomplished by inhaling through the nose while simultaneously pushing air out through the mouth using air stored in the cheeks.

==History==
The technique was developed independently by several cultures and is used for many traditional wind instruments.

Mongolian metalsmiths have long used circular breathing on flames to achieve sustained, consistent metal temperatures.

==Uses==

It is used extensively in playing the Eastern zurna, the Mongolian limbe, the Tibetan gyaling, the Sardinian launeddas, the Egyptian arghul, the Australian didgeridoo, many traditional oboes and flutes of Asia and the Middle East, and the saluang, a traditional bamboo flute from Minangkabau ethnic, West Sumatra, Indonesia. Some jazz and classical wind and brass players also use some form of circular breathing.

Although many professional wind players find circular breathing highly useful, few pieces of European orchestral music composed before the 20th century actually require its use. However, the advent of circular breathing among professional wind players has allowed for the transcription of pieces composed for string instruments containing a series of sustained notes that would otherwise be unplayable on wind instruments. A notable example is &quot;Moto Perpetuo&quot;, transcribed for trumpet by Rafael Méndez from the original violin work by Paganini.

In 1997, a Guinness World Record was set for the longest held musical note when Kenny G used circular breathing to sustain an E-flat on a saxophone for 45 minutes and 47 seconds. In February 2000, Vann Burchfield surpassed G&#x27;s record by playing one note for 47 minutes, 6 seconds. 

On his album &quot;Didgeridoo Concerto&quot; (1994), Mark Atkins played continuous tones for over 50 minutes. On 14 May 2017, Nigerian saxophonist Femi Kuti broke Atkins&#x27; record by playing for 51 minutes, 38 seconds.

== Method ==
===Performing===
The musician fully inhales and begins to exhale and blow outward. When the lungs are nearly empty, the last volume of air is blown into the mouth, and the cheeks are inflated with part of this air. Then, while still blowing this last bit of air out by squeezing the cheeks, the musician must very quickly fill the lungs by inhaling through the nose prior to running out of air in the mouth. If done correctly, by the time the air in the mouth is nearly exhausted the musician can begin to exhale from the lungs once more, ready to repeat the process again. Essentially, circular breathing bridges the gap between exhalations with air stored in the cheeks, an extra air reserve to play with while sneaking in a breath through the nose.

===Learning===
The usual first difficulty is to inhale through the nose while blowing out air stored in the cheeks. Some people may have difficulty doing this. This technique may be practiced by holding a finger in front of a thin air stream out of the lips and listening to the wind sound.

The next difficulty is to switch between cheek air and lung air without an unwelcome and uncontrolled jolt in the air pressure; this is achieved by learning to use the cheeks and the throat as a system of shock absorbers. A very simple method by which this is practiced is using a thin straw to blow on to the surface of a cup of water from just above water level, and watching the depression that the air stream creates on the water&#x27;s surface. The aim is to blow continually and switch between cheek air and lung air without any change in the depth of this depression or groove or hole on the water&#x27;s surface.

The traditional method of learning in zurna groups is to have one older player lead as the chanter zurna and ask the younger players to hold the unchanging &quot;drone tones&quot;. Professional zurna groups may play non-stop for as long as the party lasts, and a drone tone may be held for the whole evening. This is possible thanks to the disk that the lip may lean and rest against, because otherwise, the lip muscles that resist the air pressure get tired first.

<text>The South American plate is a major tectonic plate which includes the continent of South America as well as a sizable region of the Atlantic Ocean seabed extending eastward to the African plate, with which it forms the southern part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

The easterly edge is a divergent boundary with the African plate; the southerly edge is a complex boundary with the Antarctic plate, the Scotia plate, and the Sandwich Plate; the westerly edge is a convergent boundary with the subducting Nazca plate; and the northerly edge is a boundary with the Caribbean plate and the oceanic crust of the North American plate. At the Chile triple junction, near the west coast of the Taitao–Tres Montes Peninsula, an oceanic ridge known as the Chile Rise is actively subducting under the South American plate.

Geological research suggests that the South American plate is moving west away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge: &quot;Parts of the plate boundaries consisting of alternations of relatively short transform fault and spreading ridge segments are represented by a boundary following the general trend.&quot; As a result, the eastward-moving and more dense Nazca plate is subducting under the western edge of the South American plate, along the continent&#x27;s Pacific coast, at a rate of per year. The collision of these two plates is responsible for lifting the massive Andes Mountains and for creating the numerous volcanoes (including both stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes) that are strewn throughout the Andes.

<doc id="494327" wikidata="Q7544948" url="?curid=494327" title="Smith and Dale">
<text>Smith and Dale were a famous American vaudeville comedy duo. They consisted of Joe Smith (born Joseph Sultzer on February 17, 1884February 22, 1981) and Charlie Dale (born Charles Marks on September 6, 1881November 16, 1971), who both grew up in the Lower East Side of New York City at the end of the 19th century. Beginning in their adolescence, their career spanned the majority of their lives, with the two performing together continuously for more than seventy years.

The duo were one of several famous comic performers of vaudeville, radio and movies that collectively originated from the same place and era. Other entertainers included Gallagher and Shean, George Burns, Eddie Cantor, George Jessel and the Marx Brothers.

==Early life and work==
Sultzer and Marks met as teenagers in the fall of 1898, when they accidentally ran into each other while cycling. Joe was cycling north on Eldridge Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, while Charlie was cycling east on Delancey. As they argued over whose fault it was, the shopkeeper who rented the bikes said, &quot;You two sound like Weber and Fields.&quot; Initially performing under the name Sultzer and Marks, they later renamed their act to Smith and Dale because a local printer gave them a good deal on business cards that read &quot;Smith &amp; Dale&quot;. These were initially intended for a team that had since decided on a different name – Moran and Mack, unrelated to the later group of the same name. Joe Sultzer became Joe Smith, and Charlie Marks became Charlie Dale.

==The Avon Comedy Four==
Beginning in 1902, Smith and Dale partnered with singing comedians Will Lester and Jack Coleman to form a group called The Avon Comedy Four. Initially booked for a series of appearances in the Catskills region, the act was so successful that performances were continued in many other clubs for years after. Aside from Smith and Dale, membership of this group changed often over the years. Known performers included Irving Kaufman, Harry Goodwin, E. Rash, and Charles Adams. The act became one of the more successful comedy turns in vaudeville. For over 15 years, the group were top-of-the-bill performers on Broadway and appeared in the 1916 show &quot;Why Worry?&quot; The foursome made commercial recordings replicating their stage act, as in a 1917 restaurant sketch:

However, this would prove to be the group&#x27;s peak. While they continued to perform throughout the 1920s, this only resulted in a single record being published during this decade, and they proved unable to secure many lucrative contracts or gigs. This was contrasted by Smith and Dale&#x27;s popularity as a duo, which had continued to rise throughout the same period. By 1930, Smith and Dale had grown tired of the act, and so, after 28 years of performing, dissolved the Avon Comedy Four to focus exclusively on their career as a duo. Smith and Dale took up where the foursome left off, playing Broadway and vaudeville (including the Palace Theatre, considered the pinnacle of stage venues) while also beginning their movie career. Both used a heavy Jewish dialect, with Smith speaking in a deep, pessimistic voice and Dale in a high, wheedling tenor.

==&quot;Dr. Kronkheit and His Only Living Patient&quot;==
During the 1920s, Smith and Dale became famous for their signature sketch &quot;Doctor Kronkheit and His Only Living Patient,&quot; which like &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; for Abbott and Costello, became one of the famous comedy sketches of the 20th century. The name of the doctor is an inside joke: Smith and Dale, both being Jewish, named the physician Kronkheit, which is Yiddish and German for &quot;sickness&quot;. Thus we have a doctor named Dr. Sickness. Indeed, a hospital in German is called a Krankenhaus, or literally &quot;sick house&quot;.

Dr. Kronkheit (played by Dale, not Smith as is sometimes reported) is greeted by skeptical patient Smith:

SMITH: Are you a doctor?
DALE: I&#x27;m a doctor.
SMITH: I&#x27;m dubious.
DALE: I&#x27;m glad to know you, Mr. Dubious.

Most of the sketch has Dr. Kronkheit trying to determine the patient&#x27;s problem:

SMITH: Doctor, it hurts when I do this.
DALE: Don&#x27;t &quot;do&quot; that.

SMITH: Look at this, doctor.
DALE: Look at --- oh, that there? Did you ever have that before?
SMITH: Yes, I did.
DALE: Well, you got it again!

SMITH: I can&#x27;t sleep at night. I walk around all night.
DALE: Ah! You&#x27;re a somnambulist!
SMITH: No, I&#x27;m a night watchman.

SMITH: I got rheumatism on the back of my neck. It&#x27;s a bad place to have rheumatism, on the back of my neck.
DALE: No, no, where would you want a better place than on the back of your neck?
SMITH: On the back of &quot;your&quot; neck. My neck hurts me, doctor; it&#x27;s terrible.
DALE: Oh, well, sit down and open your neck.

Smith tries to object.

DALE: Mister, please, I got no patience!
SMITH: I shouldn&#x27;t have been here &quot;either!&quot;

The patient explains that he has already seen a doctor:

SMITH: He told me I had snew in my blood.
DALE: What did he told you?
SMITH: He told me I had snew in my blood.
DALE: Snew? What&#x27;s snew?
SMITH: Nothing. What&#x27;s new with you?

SMITH (reacting to Dale spitting on his stethoscope:) Doctor, what is that you&#x27;re doing?
DALE: Sterilization.

DALE: Now inhale, please.
SMITH: What?
DALE: Inhale.
SMITH: What?
DALE: Inhale! I would like to see you.
SMITH: Inhale I would like to see &quot;you!&quot;
DALE: The whole trouble with you is you need eyeglasses.
SMITH: Eyeglasses?! I suppose if I had a headache I&#x27;d need an umbrella.

Dr. Kronkheit&#x27;s fee is $10:

SMITH: For what?
DALE: For my advice.
SMITH: Ten dollars for your advice?
DALE: That&#x27;s right.
SMITH: Well, Doctor, here is &quot;two&quot; dollars; take it. That&#x27;s &quot;my&quot; advice!

In 1951, the Dr. Kronkheit routine was filmed for posterity (in color) for the RKO Radio Pictures musical &quot;Two Tickets to Broadway&quot;.

==Other movie appearances==
Smith and Dale made several short comedy movies in the late 1920s when sound movies came in. Their comedy relied on verbal interplay and timing, and they typically made changes to their act slowly. As a consequence, their material quickly was exhausted by the medium of the short film, and they never became big movie stars.

Their act can be seen (to excellent advantage) in the feature movie &quot;The Heart of New York&quot; (1932). Based on David Freedman&#x27;s stage success &quot;Mendel, Inc.&quot;, they play a pair of professional matchmakers, constantly bickering back and forth. They also ran through some of their sketches in Paramount Pictures and Vitaphone short subjects. Their &quot;firemen&quot; sketch, in which Joe and Charlie are lazy firemen who hardly pay attention when someone reports a fire, was filmed as &quot;The False Alarm Fire Co.&quot; !1929) and again as &quot;Fun in a Fire House&quot; (1936). Another routine was &quot;The Gypsy National Bank,&quot; in which fly-by-night banker Joe is questioned by prospective depositor Charlie; this was included in the vaudeville-revue short &quot;Vitaphone Diversions&quot; (1937).

In 1938, Smith and Dale starred in a pair of two-reel comedies for Columbia Pictures, both produced and directed by comedian Charley Chase: &quot;A Nag in the Bag&quot; (they operate a drive-in restaurant and gamble on a horse race) and &quot;Mutiny on the Body&quot; (they visit a shady sanitarium for a rest cure). Smith and Dale adapted surprisingly well to Columbia&#x27;s fast-paced format, but they made no other movies for the studio; executive producer Jules White didn&#x27;t care for their dialect shtick and didn&#x27;t renew their contract.

Smith and Dale also made three Soundies in 1941. These were three-minute films that played in coin-operated &quot;movie jukeboxes&quot;. In a rare exception to Soundies&#x27; all-musical policy, Smith and Dale did spoken-comedy routines.

Laurel and Hardy, another venerable comedy team, were scheduled to appear in the Technicolor musical &quot;Two Tickets to Broadway&quot; (1951), but scheduling problems forced them to withdraw. They were replaced by Smith and Dale, appearing as Leo and Harry, the proprietors of the Palace Deli. In a throwback to the Avon Comedy Four&#x27;s restaurant sketch, Smith and Dale rib each other continuously as they serve their patrons. The dialogue is so out of character with the script, and so long in comparison to other exchanges in the movie, that there can be no doubt that Smith and Dale were allowed to insert their own material into the script.

==Longevity==
Smith and Dale continued working as a team in stage, radio, nightclub, film, and television productions. They were frequent guests on New York-based variety shows like &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; (doing the &quot;firemen&quot; sketch on live television, with Art Carney as the frantic fire victim) and &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; of September 2, 1956, with Louis Nye as the fire victim. They also played &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Smith and Dale still performed in the 1960s, including an appearance at New York&#x27;s Donnell Library Center.

The partnership, known among entertainers as the longest in show-business history, endured until Charlie Dale&#x27;s death at age 89, on November 16, 1971. Smith continued to perform, mainly in guest appearances on television sitcoms, until his death on February 22, 1981, at the age of 97.

Late in their lives, both men wound up in the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey, an assisted living and nursing care facility available to those who have dedicated the major portion of their professional lives to the theatrical industry.

Smith and Dale are buried in the same cemetery plot, with a common headstone. The gravestone notes the name of the three people buried there, Dale and his wife Mollie and the widowed Smith. Smith is identified only by his show business name of Joe Smith, and his partner is listed as Charles Dale Marks, and Dale&#x27;s wife is listed as Mollie Dale Marks. The larger printing higher on the stone states &quot;Smith &amp; Dale&quot;, to which Smith added the words &quot;Booked Solid&quot;.

==Works based on Smith and Dale==

The longevity of the comedy team in Neil Simon&#x27;s play and film &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; is said to be inspired by Smith and Dale. The bickering nature of the team was said to be inspired by the vaudeville comics Gallagher and Shean.

Gordon Lish&#x27;s &quot;Extravaganza: A Joke Book&quot; (G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, 1989) is an avant-garde novel inspired by Smith and Dale&#x27;s act.

<doc id="494328" wikidata="Q63682" url="?curid=494328" title="Sibel Kekilli">
<text>Sibel Kekilli (born 16 June 1980) is a German actress. She gained public attention after starring in the 2004 film &quot;Head-On&quot;. She won two Lolas, the most prestigious German film award, for her performances in &quot;Head-On&quot; and &quot;When We Leave&quot; (2010). Beginning in 2011, she became more widely known for her role as Shae in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

==Early life==
Kekilli was born and raised in Heilbronn, to a family of Turkish origin. Her parents came to Germany from Turkey in 1977, and were described by Kekilli as having a rather modern and open attitude. After completing school with excellent grades at age 16, she entered a 30-month-long combined training program to become a certified public administration specialist at the local city administration.

After successful completion of the training program, she continued to work as an administrative assistant for another two years at Heilbronn city hall, then moved to Essen, where she worked various jobs as a bouncer, cleaner, waitress, nightclub manager, saleswoman, and pornographic film actress.

== Career ==
In 2001–2002, over a period of six months, Kekilli appeared in a number of pornographic films for various directors including Josef Baumberger and Harry S. Morgan.

In 2002, while at a shopping mall in Cologne, she was noticed by a casting director, who invited her to audition for a role in a film. She won the leading part in &quot;Head-On&quot; () against a field of 350 other hopefuls. The film was released in 2004 and was a major success, receiving several prizes at film festivals. Filming proved strenuous for Kekilli personally, and she underwent an appendectomy during filming in Turkey.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Head-On&quot;, the German tabloid newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; made public Kekilli&#x27;s earlier work in pornography. This led to a public sensation, and Kekilli&#x27;s parents broke off all contact with her. She received the 2004 Bambi prize for &quot;best shooting star&quot; for her role in &quot;Head-On&quot;. During the televised acceptance speech, she tearfully complained that she was being subject to a &quot;dreckige Hetzkampagne&quot; (&quot;dirty smear campaign&quot;) and &quot;Medienvergewaltigung&quot; (&quot;media rape&quot;). &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot; was later reprimanded by the &quot;Deutscher Presserat&quot; (German Press Council) for the manner in which it covered the story.

Kekilli starred in the Turkish coup d&#x27;état film &quot;Home Coming&quot; (&quot;Eve Dönüş&quot;) (2006), playing the wife of a man who was unjustly imprisoned and tortured. The performance won her the Best Actress award at the 2006 Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival. Also that year, she played a Jewish woman on the way to the Auschwitz concentration camp in the 2006 film &quot;The Last Train&quot; (). In 2009, she played Umay, a young Turkish woman who leaves Istanbul to return to her family in Berlin, in &quot;When We Leave&quot; (&quot;Die Fremde&quot;). She was awarded the Lola for Best Actress in 2010 for her role. In 2010, Kekilli was cast as Shae in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels.

In 2011, one year after first appearing in a supporting role in the long-running crime series &quot;Tatort&quot;, she became a permanent cast member as new investigator Sarah Brandt, working alongside chief investigator Klaus Borowski. She said that she was glad not to be playing a character of foreign descent, as she feels she has been typecast in the past. In 2017 she left the &quot;Tatort&quot; franchise, after 14 feature-length episodes, citing a need for change.

==Personal life==
Kekilli lives in Hamburg.

Since citizenship in Germany is primarily established by &quot;Jus sanguinis&quot; rather than &quot;Jus soli&quot;, she originally held Turkish rather than German citizenship, and had to apply to the Turkish government when she sought a marriage license (for a planned marriage that ultimately did not take place).

In 2017, Kekilli blocked her Instagram account from being accessed in Turkey, saying that users from that country had sent a multitude of abusive and threatening messages. She denounced the senders as &quot;bigoted, hypocrites and full of hate&quot;.

===Political activism===
Kekilli supports the organization Terre des Femmes in its work against violence against women.

In December 2006, at an anti-domestic violence event run by the Turkish newspaper &quot;Hürriyet&quot; in Berlin, she stated, in German, the equivalent of &quot;I have experienced for myself that both physical and psychological abuse are regarded as normal in a Muslim family. Sadly, violence is part of the cultural heritage in Islam.&quot; In response, the Turkish consul general left the room.

In March 2015 at an International Women&#x27;s Day event at the President of Germany&#x27;s residence at Schloss Bellevue, Kekilli gave a speech on violence against women in the name of honour. The speech drew wide attention and praise in Germany for its empathic message. In May 2015, Friedrich Naumann Foundation named Kekilli &quot;Author of Freedom&quot; for the speech.

<text>The Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 &quot;Sparviero&quot; (Italian for sparrowhawk) is a three-engined medium bomber developed and manufactured by the Italian aviation company Savoia-Marchetti. It may be the best-known Italian aeroplane of the Second World War. The SM.79 was easily recognizable due to its fuselage&#x27;s distinctive dorsal &quot;hump&quot;, and was reportedly well liked by its crews, who nicknamed it &quot;il gobbo maledetto&quot; (&quot;damned hunchback&quot;).

The SM.79 was developed in the early 1930s. It was a cantilever low-wing monoplane of combined wood and metal construction, designed with the intention of producing a swift eight-passenger transport aircraft capable of besting the fastest of its contemporaries, but its potential as a combat aircraft quickly attracted the attention of the Italian government. Performing its first flight on 28 September 1934, early examples of the type established 26 separate world records between 1937 and 1939, qualifying it for some time as the fastest medium bomber in the world. As such, the SM.79 quickly came to be regarded as an item of national prestige in Fascist Italy, attracting significant government support and often being deployed as an element of state propaganda. Early on, the aircraft was routinely entered in competitive fly-offs and air races, seeking to capitalise on its advantages, and often emerged victorious in such contests.

The SM.79 first saw combat during the Spanish Civil War. In this theatre it normally operated without fighter escort, relying on its relatively high speed to evade interception. While some problems were identified, and in some cases resolved, the SM.79&#x27;s performance during the Spanish deployment was encouraging and stimulated demand for the type, including a decision to adopt it as the backbone of Italy&#x27;s bomber units. Both Yugoslavia and Romania opted to procure the type for their own air services, while large numbers were also procured for the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;. Almost 600 SM.79-I and –II aircraft were in service when Italy entered the Second World War in May 1940; thereafter, they were deployed in every theatre of war in which the Italians fought.

The SM.79 was operated in various capacities during the Second World War, initially being used mainly as a transport aircraft and medium bomber. Following pioneering work by the &quot;Special Aerotorpedoes Unit&quot;, Italy put the type to work as a torpedo bomber; in this role, the SM.79 achieved notable successes against Allied shipping in the Mediterranean theatre of the war. A specialised drone version of the aircraft flown by remote control was also developed, although the Armistice with Italy was enacted prior to any operational deployment. It was the most numerous Italian bomber of the Second World War, with about 1,300 built. The type would remain in Italian service until 1952.

==Development==

In 1934, Italian aircraft manufacturer Savoia-Marchetti started work on what would become the SM.79. The design team was headed by aeronautical engineer Alessandro Marchetti. It had originally been conceived as a fast monoplane transport aircraft, capable of accommodating up to eight passengers and of being used in air racing (such as the London-Melbourne race). The design, which was initially designated as the &quot;SM.79P&quot; (&quot;P&quot; stood for passenger), was once intended to be a civil derivative of the Savoia-Marchetti SM.81, a militarised transport/bomber aircraft that was itself based upon the Savoia-Marchetti S.73 airliner.

The company quickly set about the construction of a single prototype of its design, being keen to participate in the high-profile London-Melbourne race if possible. The SM.79 had a three-engine configuration (two in mid-wing positions and the third mounted upon the nose) due to commercial safety concerns rather than for speed. Originally, there had been plans to adopt the Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI Ri as the aircraft&#x27;s powerplant; however, it was decided to revert to the less powerful Piaggio Stella P.IX R.C.40, a derivative of the license-produced model of the British Bristol Jupiter, on which many of Piaggio&#x27;s engines were based.

On 28 September 1934, the prototype SM.79 conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Adriano Bacula. Despite the company&#x27;s ambitions, the prototype (registration &quot;I-MAGO&quot;) was completed too late for it to be entered in the London-Melbourne race. It featured very sleek contours and continuous panoramic windows, true to its original intended role as a passenger aircraft. The prototype quickly demonstrated its speed, making a flight from Milan to Rome in just one hour and 10 minutes, flying at an average speed of . On 20 July 1935 it was given its Certificate of Airworthiness. Soon after, on 2 August 1935, the prototype established a new speed record by flying from Rome to Massaua, in Italian Eritrea, in 12 flying hours (with a refuelling stop at Cairo, Egypt).

Various other world records were established during multiple flights made by the prototype. It was determined early on that it was the engines, rather than the airframe itself, which were its limiting factor; accordingly, the prototype was re-engined multiple times. During 1935, the P.IX engines which had been originally installed were replaced by Alfa Romeo 125 RC.35s (this was a license-produced version of the Bristol Pegasus engine); during 1936, these were replaced by Alfa Romeo 126 RC.34s. The high performance demonstrated by the prototype attracted the attention of the Italian military, which approached Savoia-Marchetti with a request to investigate the prospects for producing a bomber version of the type.

An evaluation of the SM.79 from a military perspective was conducted. Amongst the determinations made was that the installation of either two or three defensive machine guns would produce a highly effective defense against contemporary fighter aircraft. In response to the military interest, the company decided to construct a militarised second prototype. While it did not differ in structure from the first civil-orientated prototype, it had a faired ventral nacelle for a bomb-aimer, a forward-firing machine gun above the pilot&#x27;s cabin, and another machine gun located on the underside of the tail. Furthermore, a third machine gun could be installed at an open position aft of the dorsal fairing to provide for further rear defense.

During October 1936, production of the SM.79 formally commenced. Initially, focus was given to producing civil aircraft while military variants continued to be developed; as such, there were a pair of principal commercial variants produced as well, these being the speed-focused &quot;SM.79C&quot; (&quot;C&quot; standing for race) and the long-range &quot;SM.79T&quot; (&quot;T&quot; for Transatlantic). Aircraft amongst these variants participated in various early record-setting attempts during 1937 and 1938. In light of opinions amongst prospective export customers regarding the desirability of a nose-mounted gun position (impossible due to the nose-mounted third engine), Savoia-Marchetti started work on the design of a two-engined model of the type, known as the &quot;SM.79B&quot;. This had a redesigned nose section which incorporated the bomb-aimer&#x27;s position and an elevated position for the pilot, along with a single movable machine gun, and was first flown during 1936.

In addition to the manufacturing activity performed by Savoia-Marchetti, in order to meet demand for the type, an Italian subcontractor in the form of Aeronautica Umbra, based in Foligno, also produced the type. Manufacture of the type continued until June 1943, during which time a total of 1,217 aircraft were completed, many of which were completed to bomber, torpedo-bomber, and transport configurations. The SM.79 has been described as being by far the most important Italian offensive warplane of the Second World War, and one of the very few Italian aircraft to be produced in substantial quantities.

==Design==
===Overview===

The SM.79 was a cantilever low-wing monoplane trimotor, with a retractable taildragger undercarriage. The fuselage used a welded tubular steel frame structure, which was covered with duralumin on the forward section, a mixture of duralumin and plywood across the upper fuselage surface, and fabric for all of the other exterior surfaces. The wings were of all-wood construction, with trailing edge flaps and leading edge slats (Handley Page style) to offset their relatively small size. The internal structure was made of three spruce and plywood spars, linked with plywood ribs, with a skin of plywood. The wing had a dihedral of 2° 15&#x27;. The ailerons were capable of rotating through +13/-26°, and were used together with the flaps in low-speed flight and in takeoff. The aircraft&#x27;s capabilities were significantly greater than its predecessor, the SM.75, with over available and a high wing loading that gave it characteristics not dissimilar to a large fighter.

The engines fitted to the main bomber version were three Alfa Romeo 126 RC.34 radials, equipped with variable-pitch, all-metal three-bladed propellers. Speeds attained were around at , with a relatively low practical ceiling of . Cruise speed was at , but the best cruise speed was (60% power). The landing was characterized by a final approach with the slats extended, slowing to with extension of flaps, and finally the run over the field with only needed to land (2,050 rpm, 644 Hg pressure).

The SM.79 was typically operated by a crew of five (or a crew of six upon the bomber version). The cockpit was designed for the accommodation of two pilots seated in a side-by-side configuration. Instrumentation in the central panel included oil and fuel gauges, altimeters for low () and high altitude (), clock, airspeed and vertical speed indicator, gyroscope, compass, artificial horizon, turn and bank indicator, rev counters and throttles.

===Performance===

The SM.79&#x27;s performance was considered fairly strong. Its rate of climb was fairly high, it was fairly fast for its time, and was both rugged and responsive enough to allow it to be looped (with care). Its wooden structure was light enough to allow it to stay afloat for up to half an hour in case of water landing, giving the crew ample time to escape, and the front engine offered some protection from anti aircraft fire. With full power available and flaps set for takeoff, the SM.79 could be airborne within before quickly climbing to an altitude of within the space of 3 minutes, in 6 minutes 30 seconds, in 9 minutes 34 seconds, in 13 minutes 2 seconds, and in 17 minutes 43 seconds.

The bomber version had 10 separate fuel tanks that had a maximum combined capacity of . Endurance when flown at full load was reportedly around 4 hours 30 minutes at an average speed of . The maximum ferry range, when flown at its optimal cruise speed, was unconfirmed; in order to reach Addis Ababa with non-stop flights from Libya, SM.79s were frequently modified in order to carry more fuel, and were able to fly over . The range (not endurance) with payload was around .

The effective torpedo bombing range was stated to be between from the target. During combat operations, SM.79s would often fly at low level above hostile vessels prior to launching the aerial torpedo; as such, they were frequently targeted by every weapon available, from infantry small arms to heavy artillery, in a last ditch effort to prevent the torpedoes from being deployed. The &quot;Sparviero&quot; had several advantages compared to British torpedo bombers, including a higher top speed and greater range. Soon however, the &quot;Sparviero&quot; faced the Hawker Hurricane and the naval Fairey Fulmar, which was faster but still quite slow in relation to other escort fighters. Bristol Beaufighters were fast and well-armed, and as well as being effective long-range day fighters, were successful night interceptors and late in the war often chased &quot;Sparvieros&quot; in night missions. Curtiss P-40s, Lockheed P-38 Lightnings, Grumman Martlets and Supermarine Spitfires serving in the Mediterranean hindered &quot;Sparviero&quot; operations during the day.

===Armament===

The defensive armament of the SM.79 initially consisted of four, later increased to five, Breda-SAFAT machine guns. Three of these were 12.7 mm (0.5 in) guns, two of which were positioned in the dorsal &quot;hump&quot;, with the forward one (with 300 rounds) fixed at an elevation of 15°, and the other manoeuvrable with 60° pivotal movement in the horizontal, and 0–70° in the vertical plane. The third 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine gun was located ventrally. Each gun except for the forward one was equipped with 500 rounds. There was also a 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Lewis Gun in one of a pair of &quot;waist&quot; mounts, on a mount that allowed rapid change of side of the weapon. This Lewis gun was later replaced by two 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Bredas in the waist mounts, which were more reliable and faster firing (900 rounds/min instead of 500), even though there was only sufficient room in the fuselage for one man to operate them. Despite the low overall &quot;hitting power&quot;, it was heavily armed by 1930s standards, the armament being more than a match for the fighter aircraft of the time, which were not usually fitted with any armour. By the Second World War, however, the &quot;Sparviero&quot;″s vulnerability to newer fighters was significant, and it lost the reputation for near-invulnerability that it had gained over Spain.

No turrets were ever installed upon any SM.79s, which imposed considerable limitations upon its fields of defensive fire. Of all its defensive weapons, the dorsal one was often considered to be the most important as, following the shift to low-level attacks, the &quot;Sparviero&quot; was attacked almost exclusively from the rear and above. The defensive weapons located in the rear gondola and the rear hump were protected by aerodynamic shields, which were intended to only be opened in the event of attackers appearing. However, in practice, an enemy aircraft could attack the &quot;Sparviero&quot; while remaining unseen, so the defensive positions were usually left open even though this had the effect of reducing the aircraft&#x27;s maximum effective speed.

The cramped layout of the ventral gondola, with the bomb-aiming instruments located in front and the rearwards-aimed ventral defensive machine gun in the rear, made it impossible to perform both bomb-aiming and rear defence simultaneously, so its usefulness was compromised. Because of this, in the later versions which were used exclusively for torpedo-bombing tasks, the ventral weapon and nacelle were removed. The fixed forward Breda machine gun, more suited to offensive tasks and aimed by the pilot, was seldom used defensively, and was often removed or replaced with a smaller calibre gun or mock-up, with an associated gain in speed and range due to the reduction in weight. The rear ventral gondola on the &quot;Sparviero&quot; was somewhat similar to the almost identically located &quot;Bola&quot; emplacement on the main wartime production -P and -H subtypes of the Heinkel He 111 German medium bomber, which was only used as a ventral defensive armament mount on the German aircraft.
As with the Luftwaffe&#x27;s He 111, the &quot;Sparviero&#x27;s&quot; bomb bay was configured to carry bombs vertically; this design decision had the consequence of preventing large bombs from being accommodated internally. The aircraft could accommodate a pair of , five , 12 bombs, or hundreds of bomblets. The bombardier, who had an 85° forward field of view from their position, was normally provided with a &quot;Jozza-2&quot; aiming system, automatic cameras and a series of bomb-release mechanisms. The machine gun to the rear of the gondola prevented the bombardier from lying in a prone position, and as a result, the bombardier was provided with retractable structures to support his legs while seated.

From 1939 onwards, two torpedoes could be carried externally, as could larger bombs, on two hardpoints fitted under the inner wing. However, in practice, owing to the reduced performance and manoeuvrability of the aircraft when carrying two torpedoes, usually only one was carried. The SM.79&#x27;s overall payload of precluded carrying of bombs without a noticeable reduction of the fuel load (approximately , when full). The standard torpedo, a 1938 Whitehead design, had a weight of , length of and a HE warhead. It had a range at 74 km/h (40 kn), and could be launched from a wide range of speeds and altitudes: and up to maximum. It took over ten years to develop effective torpedo-bombing techniques; consequently, with the failure of the SM.84 (its intended successor) and the lack of power of the Ca.314, only the SM.79 continued to serve as a torpedo bomber until 1944, despite trials conducted with many other types of aircraft, including the Fiat G.55S fighter.

==Operational history==

===Record-setting aircraft===
Although Italy did not win the prestigious Schneider Trophy, state support for aeronautical feats was maintained as one element of Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini&#x27;s long term propaganda campaign to promote and win prestige for fascist Italy and his government. Following a pair of initial successes, further &quot;Sparvieros&quot; received specialised modifications for the purpose of establishing new speed records. The SM.79 prototype &quot;I-MAGO&quot; was modified to carry a payload of of bombs internally, which enabled it to attempt speed records while carrying a payload. On 23 September 1935, it flew for with a load at an average speed of , breaking six separate world records in the process.

As on the prototype, the &quot;hump&quot; was not fitted to some of the first production aircraft, these being transformed into performance aircraft, designated as the &quot;SM.79CS&quot;. One of these aircraft established further records during 1937; powered by an arrangement of three Piaggio P.XI RC.40 engines (providing a combined thrust of ), it averaged over with a payload. This record then improved to , while another SM.79 achieved in the / category. Unofficially, a speed of was later achieved in the same category.

A group of five SM.79CSs went on to enter the Paris-Damascus–Istres race. &quot;I-CUPA&quot;, &quot;I-FILU&quot; and &quot;I-BIMU &quot; took the first three positions, while the other two were placed sixth and seventh, the latter of which was heavily damaged in Damascus. A pair of Fiat BR.20s had also competed in the same race, but were only able to achieve a joint sixth place (with a SM.79) and an eighth place. Three of the SM.79CSs were modified to increase their endurance, allowing them to traverse the Atlantic Ocean and reach Brazil. On 24 January 1938, the three aircraft took off; 11 hours later, they landed in Dakar, Senegal, where they refuelled before heading for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; on 25 January, two of the three arrived at 22:45 local time. However, one of the aircraft suffered a technical fault, forcing the crew to land at Natal, Northeastern Brazil; this SM.79 remained there for some time, and was eventually donated to the Brazilian Air Force.

===Regia Aeronautica===
====Introduction====

The 12° &quot;Stormo&quot; (Wing) was the first to be equipped with the SM.79, starting in early 1936, and was involved in the initial evaluation of the bomber, which continued throughout 1936. The Wing went operational on 1 May 1936 with the SM.79 successfully completing torpedo launches from a target distance of in August 1936. The torpedo bomber variant was much more unstable and harder to control than the civilian version (and much less precise than its successor, the SM.81). Its capabilities were still being explored when the Spanish Civil War broke out, and a number of SM.79s were dispatched to support the Nationalists.

Following its service in the Spanish Civil War, the &quot;Sparviero&quot; came into use with 111° and 8° Wing. By the end of 1939, there were 388 &quot;Sparvieros&quot; in Italian service, spread across 11 wings that were either partially or totally equipped with this aircraft. The type also participated in the Italian occupation of Albania during autumn 1939. By the beginning of the Second World War, a total of 612 aircraft had been delivered, making the &quot;Sparviero&quot; the most numerous bomber in the whole of the &quot;Regia Aereonautica&quot;, assigned to a total of 14 wings (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 41 and 46). Not all of these wings had &quot;Gruppi&quot; (groups) entirely equipped with the SM.79. Every squadron had around nine to 10 aircraft, but this included second line aircraft, so the force of each squadron consisted on average of around seven to eight bombers, and every wing had around 30 bombers. Among these units; 8, 9, 11, 12, 30, 32, 36, 41 and 46 &quot;Stormi&quot; (Wings) were based in Italy, and participated in the Battle of France. They were equipped with a total of around 350 SM.79s, including those used in training squadrons.

====Spanish Civil War====
The SM.79 saw action for the first time when serving with the &quot;Aviazione Legionaria&quot;, an Italian unit sent to assist Franco&#x27;s Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. The &quot;Sparviero&quot; started its operational service at the end of 1936 when 8° &quot;Stormo B.T.&quot; (Bombardamento Tattico), with &quot;Gruppi&quot; XXVII° and XXVIII°, under the command of &quot;Tenente Colonnello&quot; Riccardo Seidl, was sent to Spain. Deployed to the Balearic Islands, the unit was named &quot;Falchi delle Baleari&quot; (Balearic Falcons) and operated over Catalonia and the main cities of eastern Spain, attacking the Second Spanish Republic, killing 2,700 civilians and injuring more than 7,000. During the three years of the civil conflict, in excess of 100 SM.79s served as bombers for the &quot;Aviazione Legionaria&quot;, of these, only four were recorded as being lost in combat. Due to the experience gained in Spain the SM.79-II, introduced during October 1939, went on to form the backbone of the Italian bomber corps during the Second World War.

By 4 November 1936, there were only six SM.79s with enough crew to fly them operating in Spain. At the beginning of 1937, there were 15 SM.79s in total, and they went on to be used in Spain throughout the conflict, experiencing few losses throughout. Around 19 SM.79s of what was dispatched to the Spanish theatre were lost, while deliveries to 12 Wing and other units involved in combat numbered at least 100 aircraft. 
The first recorded interception of an SM.79 formation took place on 11 October 1937 when three aircraft were attacked by a formation of 12 Polikarpov I-16s. One of the SM.79s was damaged, but its defensive armament prevented the fighters from performing close-up attacks. All of the bombers successfully returned to base, although one had been hit by 27 bullets, many of which having struck fuel tanks. Several other interceptions occurred during the conflict without any SM.79s being lost as a result.

On 26 April 1937, three SM.79 took part in the bombing of Basque town of Guernica, carried out with the Nazi German Luftwaffe&#x27;s Condor Legion, at the behest of Francisco Franco&#x27;s rebel Nationalist faction. The bombing, under the code name &#x27;Operation Rügen&#x27;, opened the way to Franco&#x27;s capture of Bilbao and his victory in northern Spain. 
Combat experience gained during the war had revealed some deficiencies present in the SM.79: the lack of oxygen masks for high altitude operation, relatively high levels of instability, vibrations experienced at speeds over and other problems were encountered and sometimes solved. General Valle, in an attempt to answer some of the criticisms about the ability of the aircraft to operate at night, took off from Guidonia and bombed Barcelona, a journey of six hours and 15 minutes. On this occasion, the aircraft proved it had a useful range (around with eight bombs, for a total gross weight of around . SM.79s initially operated from the Balearic Islands and later from mainland Spain. Hundreds of missions were performed in a wide range of roles against Republican targets. No Fiat CR.32s were required to escort the SM.79s, partly because the biplane fighters were too slow to keep up with the type.

====Malta====
The SM.79 began to lose its reputation for invulnerability when RAF Gloster Gladiators and Hawker Hurricanes were encountered over the fortress-island Malta, at the centre of the Mediterranean, in June 1940. The first of many &quot;Sparvieros&quot; shot down over Malta fell on 22 June. That day, &quot;Sparviero&quot; M.M.22068 of 216a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, piloted by &quot;Tenente&quot; Francesco Solimene, took off at 18.15 to reconnoitre intended bombing targets on the island. Two Gladiators were scrambled, one piloted by Flt Lt George Burges. Over Sliema and Valletta Burges attacked the &quot;Sparviero&quot; from superior height, shooting off the port engine. The SM.79 caught fire and crashed in the sea off Kalafrana. The pilot, Solimene, and&quot;1° Aviere Armiere&quot; Torrisi were rescued from the sea, but the other four crew members were lost.

A &quot;Sparviero&quot; had the dubious honour of being the first aircraft to fall on Maltese soil during the Second World War: on 10 July 1940, an estimated twenty SM.79s without escort arrived to bomb the dockyard, Manoel Island, Tarxien and Żabbar. They were attacked by British Gladiators; during the ensuing engagement, one bomber, piloted by &quot;Sottotenente&quot; Felice Filippi from 195a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, 90° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, 30° &quot;Stormo Bombardamento Terrestre&quot;, came down in flames just behind the Knight&#x27;s watchtower east of Fort San Leonardo. The air victory was credited to Flying Officer Frederick Taylor. At least one Italian bailed out, but his parachute was on fire and he did not survive.

====Other theaters====
A small number of SM.79s saw service in Ethiopia; according to Apostolo, it was the most advanced aircraft to be deployed to the theatre by either side. On the western side of Italian East Africa, at Diredawa, 6a and 7a &quot;Squadriglie&quot; of 44° &quot;Gruppo&quot; operated twelve SM.79s each. Italy also had six SM.79s as part of the reserve forces but two of them were under repair. The &quot;Sparviero&quot; was the only type present that had not participated in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. The SM.79s of Italian East Africa first saw action on 13 June 1940, when nine of them took off from Diredawa to attack Aden. The SM.79 flown by &quot;Sottotenente&quot; Ruffini was hit by anti-aircraft fire from a British warship and crashed. Two Gloster Gladiators then intercepted the remaining bombers; Pilot Officer Stephenson&#x27;s Gladiator attacked the &quot;Sparviero&quot; of &quot;Capitano&quot; Serafini, which had been damaged by anti-aircraft fire, but the Gladiator was hit by the SM.79&#x27;s dorsal gunner, forcing it to crash-land. Serafini managed to land at Assab, but his aircraft was a write-off; another Savoia Marchetti was damaged, but landed at the same base. These few aircraft were later reinforced by others which were modified to fly at an economical speed over Sudan for the hazardous ferry flight of over . They could not, however, do much to help Italian forces in Ethiopia, which were forced to surrender in spring 1941. The same period saw the five Iraqi SM.79Bs and the 45 SM.79Ks in Yugoslavian service unable to mount a successful defence in either Iraq or Yugoslavia.
During the North African campaign, around 100 SM.79s served in 10, 14, 15 and 30 Wings, bombing mainly non-strategic targets in the desert. The British offensive in December hit the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; hard and many wings (a total of nine by May 1941) were phased out because of losses caused by enemy aircraft and ground fire. One aircraft was destroyed on the ground by R patrol of the Long Range Desert Group at the western landing ground at Jebel Uweinat in November 1940 (the remains were still there in 2003). At the beginning of 1941 only around 40 SM.79s were still present in Libya, and by the end of 1941 only one operational squadron remained. In the Second Battle of El Alamein, many &quot;Sparvieros&quot; were used for defensive tasks, such as countering SAS teams in the desert, and in anti-ship roles.

From autumn 1940, SM.79s were used against the Kingdom of Greece, then Yugoslavia. They continued to be hampered in their operations by the Royal Air Force, but also by poor weather conditions. Over the Mediterranean, the &quot;Sparvieros&quot; were used in reconnaissance missions and anti-ship attacks.

====Use as a torpedo bomber====
=====1940=====
On 25 July 1940, the &quot;Sparviero&quot; formally commenced service as a torpedo bomber (&quot;Aerosilurante&quot; in Italian) as a new operational unit, the &quot;Special Aerotorpedoes Unit&quot; (headed by Colonel Moioli), was established following several years of experiments involving the type. After having ordered the first 50 torpedoes from Whitehead Torpedo Works, on 10 August 1940, the first aircraft landed at T5 airfield, near Tobruk. Despite the lack of an aiming system and a specific doctrine for tactics, an attack on shipping in Alexandria was quickly organized. There had been experiments for many years but still, no service, no gear (except hardpoints) and no tactics were developed for the new role. This was despite previous Italian experiments into the practice of aerial torpedoing in 1914, 26 years earlier.

On 15 August 1940, the type&#x27;s first combat sortie saw five SM.79s that had been modified and prepared for the task dispatched to El Adem airfield. Among their pilots were Buscaglia, Dequal and other pilots destined to become &quot;aces.&quot; The journey was made at an altitude of and after two hours, at 21:30, they arrived over Alexandria and began attacking ships, but unsuccessfully. The departure airport had only of runway for takeoff, so two of the fuel tanks were left empty to reduce weight, giving an endurance of five hours for a 4.33-hour journey. Only Buscaglia and Dequal returned, both aircraft damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Buscaglia landed on only one wheel, with some other damage. The other three SM.79s, attacking after the first two, were hindered by a fierce anti-aircraft defence and low clouds and returned to their base without releasing their torpedoes. However, all three ran out of fuel and were forced to jettison the torpedoes which exploded in the desert, and then force-landed three hours after the attack. Two crews were rescued later, but the third (Fusco&#x27;s) was still in Egypt when they force-landed. The crew set light to their aircraft the next morning, which alerted the British who then captured them. These failures were experienced within a combat radius of only about , in clear contrast with the glamorous performances of the racer &quot;Sparvieros&quot; just a few years before.

Many missions followed, on 22–23 August (Alexandria), 26 August (against ships never found), and 27 August (Buscaglia against a cruiser). The special unit became known as the 278a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, and from September 1940 carried out many shipping attacks, including on 4 September (when Buscaglia had his aircraft damaged by fighters) and 10 September, when Robone claimed a merchant ship sunk. On 17 September, after an unsuccessful day attack, Buscaglia and Robone returned at night, attacking the British ships that shelled Bardia. One torpedo hit , damaging the heavy cruiser to the extent that the ship remained under repair until September 1941. After almost a month of attacks, this was the first success officially acknowledged and proven. After almost a month of further attacks, a newcomer, Erasi, flew with Robone on 14 October 1940 against a British formation and hit , a modern cruiser that lost her bow and needed 13 months of repair. After several months, and despite the losses and the first unfortunate mission, the core of the 278a was still operating the same four aircraft. The last success of this squadron was at Souda Bay, Crete, when Buscaglia damaged another cruiser, , despite the anti-torpedo netting surrounding the ship, sending it out of commission for nine months while repairs were made. The aircraft continued in service until a British bomb struck them, setting off a torpedo and a &quot;chain reaction&quot; which destroyed them all.

=====1941=====
The year was one of intense activity for the Italian torpedo bombers. In April many successes were recorded by SM.79s of the 281a and 280a &quot;Squadriglie&quot;. They sank two merchant ships, heavily damaged the British cruiser (rendering her out of service for nine months for repair and refit) and later also sank the F-class destroyer . However, one SM.79 was shot down north west of Gozo on 3 June, landing in the sea and staying afloat for some time. Further Italian successes came in August, when the light cruiser was damaged. The large merchant ship SS &quot;Imperial Star&quot; (12,427 GRT)) was damaged by an SM.79 on 27 September during Operation Halberd which resupplied Malta; unable to tow it to Malta it was scuttled by HMS &quot;Oribi&quot;. In the same Operation the battleship was torpedoed and damaged by a SM.79 which in turn was shot down. The 130° and 132° &quot;Gruppi&quot; were also active during the autumn. On 24 October, they sank the merchant vessels and , on 23 November they sank the merchant vessels &quot;Glenearn&quot; and &quot;Xhakdina&quot;, and on 11 December they heavily damaged &quot;Jackal&quot;.

The year ended with a total of nine Allied ships sunk and 30 damaged; for 14 torpedo bombers lost and another 46 damaged in action. This was the best year for the Italian torpedo bombers and also the year when the SM.84, the SM.79&#x27;s successor was introduced. Overall, these numbers meant little in the war, and almost no other results were recorded by Italian bombers. Horizontal bombing proved to be a failure and only dive bombers and torpedo-bombers achieved some results. Most of the major British ships lost were due to U-boat attacks, with the damaging of , and the sinking of and , whereas the most significant success of Italian torpedo bombers were the damaging of HMS &quot;Nelson&quot; and of some cruisers. After the Raid on Alexandria by Italian frogmen of Decima MAS, the British fleet was left without major ships in their Mediterranean fleet, leaving the Axis better situated to control the sea.

=====1942=====

The Axis&#x27; fortunes started to decline steadily during 1942. Over 100 SM.79s were in service in different Italian torpedo squadrons. In addition to its wide-scale deployment in its intended bomber-torpedo bomber role, the &quot;Sparviero&quot; was also used for close support, reconnaissance and transport missions. In the first six months of 1942, all the Italo-German efforts to hit Allied ships had only resulted in the sinking of the merchant ship &quot;Thermopilae&quot; by an aircraft flown by Carlo Faggioni.

The Allies aimed to provide Malta with vital supplies and fuel through major convoy operations at all costs. Almost all Axis air potential was used against the first big Allied convoy of 1942, code-named Operation Harpoon. 14 June saw the second torpedoing of &quot;Liverpool&quot;, by a 132º &quot;Gruppo&quot; SM.79, putting it out of action for another 13 months. Regardless of where the torpedo struck (amidships in the case of &quot;Liverpool&quot;, aft as for &quot;Kent&quot;, or forward as happened to &quot;Glasgow&quot;), the cruisers remained highly vulnerable to torpedoes, but no Italian air attack managed to hit them with more than one torpedo at once. On the same day the merchant ship &quot;Tanimbar&quot; was sunk by SM.79s of the 132nd, and finally the day after , a , already damaged by two Italian cruisers, was sunk by pilot M. Aichner, also of 132nd &quot;Gruppo&quot;. For years this victory was contested by the Italian Navy, who claimed to have sunk &quot;Bedouin&quot; with gunfire.

August saw heavy attacks on the 14 merchant ships and 44 major warships of the Operation Pedestal convoy, the second Allied attempt to resupply Malta past Axis bombers, minefields and U-boats. Nine of the merchant ships and four of the warships were sunk, and others were damaged, but only the destroyer and the merchant ship MV &quot;Deucalion&quot; were sunk by Italian torpedo bombers. Although damaged, the tanker , a key part of the convoy, was towed into Grand Harbour to deliver the vital fuel on 15 August 1942 to enable Malta to continue functioning as an important Allied base, a major Allied strategic success.

By winter 1942, in contrast to Operation Torch, 9 December was a successful day when four SM.79s sank a Flower-class corvette and a merchant ship, with the loss of one aircraft. Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia, another prominent member of the Italian torpedo-airforce who was credited with over 90,718 tonnes (100,000 tons) of enemy shipping sunk, was shot down the day after saying &quot;We will probably all be dead before Christmas&quot;. The risks of attempting to overcome the effective defences of allied ships were too great to expect much chance of long-term survival, but he was later rescued from the water, badly wounded. On 18 November, the light cruiser was torpedoed and badly damaged during Operation Stone Age.

Despite the increased activity in 1942, the results were considerably poorer than those of the previous year; the efforts made by the bombers were subject to heavy criticism and widely deemed to have been insufficient. Many debated the possibilities of torpedo manufacturing defects or even sabotage: the first 30 used in 1940 had excellent reliability, but a number of later torpedoes were found to be defective, especially those made at the Naples factory. During Operation Harpoon, over 100 torpedoes were launched, but only three of these had hit their targets.

=====1943=====

Prior to 1943, the survival chances of the &quot;Aerosiluranti&quot; had diminished steadily: on average, a SM.79 would be shot down after just three missions. The year opened with attacks against Allied shipping off North Africa, during which they were unable to accomplish many successes. During July, the Allies invaded Sicily with an immense fleet. The &quot;Sparvieri&quot; were already obsolete and phased out of service in bomber Wings and its intended successors, the SM.84 and Z.1007, were considered to be failures, while the latter were not produced in enough numbers. As a consequence, the latest version of the &quot;Sparviero&quot; was retained for performing torpedo attacks, being considerably faster than its predecessors.

Before the invasion, there was a large force of torpedo aircraft: 7 &quot;Gruppi&quot; (groups), 41, 89, 104, 108, 130, 131 and 132nd equipped with dozens of aircraft, but this was nevertheless a weak force. Except for the 104th, based around the Aegean Sea, the other six &quot;Gruppi&quot; comprised just 61 aircraft, with only 22 serviceable. Almost all the available machines were sent to the &quot;Raggruppamento Aerosiluranti&quot;, but of the 44 aircraft, only a third were considered flight-worthy by 9 July 1943. Production of new SM.79s continued to fall behind and up to the end of July only 37 SM.79s and 39 SM.84s were delivered. Despite the use of an improved engine, capable of a maximum speed of , these machines were unable to cope with the difficult task of resisting the invasion. They were too large to allow them to evade detection by enemy defences, and their large aircrew requirement resulted in heavy losses of personnel. In the first five days SM.79s performed 57 missions, at night only, and failed to achieve any results, with the loss of seven aircraft. Another three aircraft were lost on 16 July 1943 in a co-ordinated attack with German forces on , which was hit and put out of combat for many months.

SM.79s were not equipped with radar, so the attacks had to be performed visually, hopefully aided by moonlight, while the Allies had ship-borne radar and interceptor aircraft. Despite their depleted state, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; attempted a strategic attack on Gibraltar on 19 July with 10 SM.79GAs, but only two managed to reach their target, again without achieving any result. During September 1943, the last offensive operation involving the type was conducted, and resulted in the damaging of the LST 417, on 7 September 1943.

On 8 September, when the Armistice with Italy was announced, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had no fewer than 61 SM.79s, of which 36 were operational. Following the signing of the Armistice, the SM.79s based in southern Italy (34 altogether) were used by the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force as transport aircraft in support of the Allies; those that remained in the North (believed to number roughly 36 aircraft) continued to fight along German forces as part of the &quot;Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; or were incorporated into the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. A small number of SM.79s remained in service in the post-war &quot;Aeronautica Militare&quot;, where they served as passenger transports into the early 1950s.

=====RSI service: 1943–1945=====
After the Armistice, the &quot;Repubblica Sociale Italiana&quot; (RSI) decided to continue using the SM.79s as torpedo-bombers. But only 15 more &quot;Sparvieri&quot; were built after the armistice, while five were overhauled by the Reggiane factories. Counting the aircraft taken over from the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, new deliveries and aircraft in workshops and depots, the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana (ANR) had 73 SM.79 at its disposal. They were mostly SM.79-III type. This version featured strengthened armament and had no ventral &quot;bathtub&quot; turret. They were based mostly in Venegono. Two secondary bases were Merna di Gorizia and Perugia, in Umbria.

The first missions attempted to oppose the Anzio landings, where the British and American forces had landed on 22 January 1944. On the evening of 10 March, a flight of six ANR SM.79s attacked Allied merchant ships near the Anzio-Nettuno beachhead, during which a single &quot;Sparviero&quot; was lost. On the night of 13–14 March five SM.79s repeated the attack.

The &quot;Gruppo Buscaglia&quot; suffered heavy losses on 4 April, when 13 unescorted SM.79s, during a ferry flight from Lonate Pozzolo to Perugia, were bounced by P-47s: five &quot;Sparvieri&quot; were shot down and 27 crew members were killed. According to other sources, this encounter occurred on 6 April and four out of seven SM.79s were shot down, while the other three crash-landed. During one of the missions on Anzio, &quot;Comandante&quot; Carlo Faggioni was killed. On 10 April 1944, four SM.79s took off to attack the Anzio bridgehead. &quot;Capitano&quot; Faggioni&#x27;s aircraft was hit by AA fire and crashed into the sea; only one &quot;Sparviero&quot; was able to return to base. Immediately thereafter, &quot;Capitano&quot; Marino Marini took command of the torpedo-bomber group; early on, Marini set about planning a mission over Gibraltar.

For this mission, 12 SM.79 bis models were used. They had enhanced engines, armoured shields for the lateral machine guns, an additional 1,000 L (264 US gal) fuel tank in the bomb bay, and had the bombardier&#x27;s nacelle removed. Even these modifications could not provide sufficient range to achieve the necessary distance that the mission required, and so all weapons except one were removed, one member of crew was left behind, and the fuel load was increased to 5,000 L (1,320 US gal). To reach Gibraltar, it was necessary to take off from Istres, in Southern France, and then fly for a total of . Of the 12 aircraft that departed from Istres on 5 June 1944, 10 reached their target (according to other sources, ten SM.79s took off on 4 June and nine reached the target). The defenders were taken by surprise, and all the aircraft successfully launched their torpedoes, but three SM.79s ran out of fuel and were forced to land in Spain. Initial claims by the Italians were four ships sunk, totalling 27,216 tonnes (30,000 tons). German observers in Algeciras, in Spain, reported that four ships, totalling 30,000 tons were badly damaged and that two others had been hit.
British sources however stated that no ships were lost, due to an effective system of defence. Regardless, this was the largest enemy incursion over Gibraltar in four years of war and this operation demonstrated the flying skill of the Republican torpedo airmen.

The following data shows the decline in effectiveness of the SM.79 as a torpedo bomber:
* During 1940, two squadrons made 39 sorties and 17 attacks; the damaging of 27,578 tonnes (30,400 tons) of shipping was attributed to these squadrons in this period.
* In 1941, a total of 14 squadrons conducted 225 sorties and 87 attacks, which were responsible for the sinking of nine ships (42,373 tonnes/47,700 tons) and another 12 being damaged (75,841 tonnes/83,600 tons).
* During 1942, 24 squadrons comprising 307 aircraft performed 60 attacks, sinking 10 ships (27,624 tonnes/30,450 tons) and damaging three 29,157 tonnes (32,140 tons).
* In 1943, 18 squadrons made 221 combat sorties, during which three ships were sunk (12,519 tonnes/13,800 tons) and another four were damaged (32,024 tonnes/35,300 tons).

During July 1944, several SM.79s were transferred to Eleusis/Athens base to carry out sorties in the Eastern Mediterranean. Their crews achieved some successes then and came back to Lonate Pozzolo on 12 August. In October, this formation was renamed &quot;Gruppo O.M. Carlo Faggioni&quot;.
After a time, the RSI torpedo-bombers based in Ghedi in October 1944 became operative again, with 10 aircraft. On 25 December 1944 they attacked a convoy in Adriatic Sea off Ancona, and &quot;Capitano&quot; Bertuzzi hit a 7,000-ton freighter with a torpedo. The following day, a formation of Republic P-47 Thunderbolt destroyed 14 &quot;Sparvieri&quot; on Lonate Pozzolo airfield. The only two serviceable SM.79s left flew the last operational mission of the group and sank a 5,000-ton ship in the Adriatic off the Dalmatian coast.

=====Results against Allied warships=====

Throughout the conflict, SM.79s were credited with the sinking of a number of Allied warships, including the destroyer HMS &quot;Fearless&quot; on 23 July 1941, the destroyer HMS &quot;Bedouin&quot; on 15 June 1942, the destroyer HMAS &quot;Nestor&quot; on 16 June 1942, the destroyer HMS &quot;Foresight&quot; on 13 August 1942, the sloop HMS &quot;Ibis&quot; on 10 November 1942, the corvette HMS &quot;Marigold&quot; on 9 December 1942, the auxiliary anti-aircraft ship HMS &quot;Pozarica&quot; on 29 January 1943.

Additionally, several more Allied warships were torpedoed and suffered serious damage as a result of attacks by the SM.79s. These included the heavy cruiser HMS &quot;Kent&quot; on 18 September 1940, the light cruiser HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; twice, on 8 October 1940 and on 14 June 1942, the light cruiser HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; on 7 December 1940, the light cruiser HMS &quot;Manchester&quot; on 23 July 1941, the light cruiser HMS &quot;Phoebe&quot; on 27 August 1941, the battleship HMS &quot;Nelson&quot; on 23 September 1941, the light cruiser HMS &quot;Arethusa&quot; on 18 November 1942, and the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot; on 16 July 1943.

====Radio controlled flying bomb====
During 1942, General Ferdinando Raffaelli reportedly came up with the idea of packing an SM.79 with explosives and a radio control device. On 12 August 1942, as the Operation Pedestal convoy was steaming off the Algerian coast, a SM.79 drone, a Z.1007bis guide plane and an escort of five FIAT G.50 fighters flew out to intercept it. Once the pilot of the SM.79 had set his aircraft on a course toward the Allied ships he bailed out, leaving the Z.1007bis crew to guide the flying bomb the rest of the way by radio. However, the radio controls malfunctioned and with nothing to guide it the SM.79 drone cruised along until it ran out of fuel and crashed into Mount Khenchela on the Algerian mainland. Raffaelli later developed a simpler single-engined guided bomb, the Ambrosini A.R.4, which was tested in June 1943, but the armistice intervened before it could go into production. Another proposal suggested using a parasite Macchi C.202 coupled with a SM.79 or A.R.4 in an arrangement similar to the German Mistel, but with the fighter remotely guiding the bomber to its target.

====Notable crewmembers====
Among the men who became famous through serving in the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, the &quot;Sparviero&quot; crews became even more renowned than fighter aces because of the initial records set, the successful raids in Spain, especially those made by the &quot;Green Mice&quot; (&quot;I sorci verdi&quot;), and the torpedo missions carried out during the war which became the subject of fascist propaganda. Among the men famous for serving in &quot;Sparvieri&quot; were: 
* Giulio Cesare Graziani (relative of Marshal Rodolfo Graziani), who before joining the 132nd Torpedo Squadron, was badly wounded in an encounter with RAF Hurricanes and made a forced landing in the Ethiopian desert. Postwar, he later rose to the rank of Lieutenant General of the Air Force.
* Carlo Faggioni, one of the more skilled pilots, who was shot down in 1944 during the Anzio landings. Only his hat was recovered from the sea.
* Martino Aichner (nicknamed &quot;Dolphin&quot;), who made an inauspicious start to his career by hitting the sea during a low-level run in training that destroyed the propellers of both wing-mounted engines of his &quot;Sparviero&quot;, and running on only the power of the central engine, managed a sea landing. He was involved in the sinking of the already crippled destroyer on 15 June 1942, which was able to shoot down his bomber, forcing him to ditch in the sea, and in 1943 he was forced to make a third landing in the sea.
* Emilio Pucci became a designer after the war.
* Guido Cimicchi, Dequal, Robone and Faggioni, who were some of the early torpedo bomber pilots.
* Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia, perhaps the most famous and highest scoring SM.79 pilot, who was involved in the torpedoing of the &quot;Kent&quot; and the &quot;Glasgow&quot;, and was shot down in December 1942. After the Italian Armistice Buscaglia joined the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force; while flying a Martin Baltimore, he crashed during takeoff and died as a result of his injuries the day after.
* Italo Balbo, notable Italian pilot, air marshal and military commander during the Second World War, who was shot down over Tobruk by friendly fire, an incident that Balbo&#x27;s closest friends and family strongly believed was an assassination ordered by Mussolini. Historians have generally accepted that this incident was an accident.

===Yugoslavia===

Favourable reports of the type&#x27;s reliability and performance during the Spanish Civil War led to the 1938 Kingdom of Yugoslavia&#x27;s order of 45 aircraft generally similar to the SM.79-I variant, designated the SM.79K. They were delivered to Yugoslavia in 1939, but most were destroyed during the 1941 Axis invasion by their crews or by advancing Axis forces. During several sorties against German and Italian forces they managed some success in Kačanik Gorge. Some of these aircraft escaped to Greece, carrying King Peter Karadjordjevic and his entourage. A few survived, one to be pressed into service with the pro-Axis forces of the NDH, and four which became AX702-AX705 in the RAF.

===Romania===
During 1937, the Romanian government decided to place an order for 24 twin-engined SM.79B bombers, fitted with Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major 14K radial engines. These aircraft, however, proved to be underpowered. Consequently, in February 1940, Romania ordered from Italy a further eight aircraft, which were each equipped with two Junkers Jumo 211 inline engines of . These aircraft were designated &quot;JIS 79&quot; (J for Jumo, I for Italy and S for Savoia) and were delivered in 1941–2. A further 72 SM.79s were built under licence by the Industria Aeronautică Română (IAR) and designated JRS 79B (J for Jumo, R for Romania, S for Savoia). Another license-built version was the JRS 79B1, which was armed with a single 20 mm Ikaria cannon and fitted with an enlarged cockpit for a fifth crew member. Due to its role in low-level attacks, the type frequently suffered heavy losses.

===Others===

A number of twin-engined versions were sold to Brazil (three with Alfa Romeo 128 RC.18 engines) and Iraq (four with Fiat A.80 RC.14 engines).

==Variants==
;SM.79
:Prototype S.79P (civil variant), powered by radial engines Piaggio Stella P.IX (610 cv). Roll-out 28 September 1934. The first flight was conducted on 8 October 1934. During spring 1935, it was re-equipped with Alfa Romeo 125 RC.35 (590–750 cv) and used as fast airliner for Regia Aeronautica and for some reconnaissance missions over Ethiopia.

==Mishaps and combat losses==

While the SM.79 was often considered overall to be a relatively sturdy and well-developed aircraft, the type experienced its share of misfortune.

In Spain, SM.79 &quot;MM.28-16&quot; (with a total crew of 17) was destroyed in the air on 12 April 1938, when one of its bombs detonated in the bomb bay. &quot;MM.28-25&quot; (again with a crew of 17) was lost when another SM.79 damaged by anti-aircraft guns collided with it on 23 March. A further SM.79, &quot;MM.28-16&quot; was damaged by an anti-aircraft shell, and landed with dead and wounded on-board (4 January 1939).
On 30 June 1939 two of the aircraft, &quot;13-6&quot; and &quot;13-7&quot;, both carrying a full fuel load, collided and crashed, with the entire crew of nine killed on impact.

At the beginning of World War II, on 13 June 1940, six &quot;Sparvieri&quot; of 9° &quot;Stormo&quot; (Wing) bombed Ghisonaccia airfield, in Corsica, but one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns and became the first &quot;Sparviero&quot; downed in that war.

The 9° &quot;Stormo&quot; continued to suffer heavy losses in Africa. Initially used to harass light forces operating in the desert, the &quot;Sparvieros&quot; were subsequently sent against the British advanced columns in Operation Compass. On 16 December 1940, six &quot;Sparvieros&quot; were sent over As Sallum to counter enemy armoured units, but before they could reach their target, three of the lead section were shot down with the loss of 16 men, including Commander Mario Aramu. The wing was put out of action and the personnel were sent back to Italy aboard the RM &quot;Città di Messina&quot;, but on 14 January 1941 the ship was sunk by submarine , with the loss of 432 men, including 53 members of the 9°. The wing was later re-formed with Z.1007s.

* 9–11 July 1940: Battle of Calabria, one SM.79 (38th &quot;Gruppo&quot;) was downed by a Blackburn Skua of . On 11 July, another SM.79 (90th &quot;Gruppo&quot;) was downed by a Gloster Sea Gladiator of .
* 1 August 1940: an SM.79 was shot down by a Skua from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. This was General Stefano Cagna&#x27;s aircraft.
* 2 September, Operation Hats: the new Fairey Fulmar fighters based on downed a 41° &quot;Stormo&quot; SM.79.
* 4 September: another SM.79 (34th &quot;Gruppo&quot;) was downed by Fulmars.
* 12–14 October 1940, Operation MW 2: two SM.79 (36° &quot;Stormo&quot;) were downed by Fulmars from &quot;Illustrious&quot;.
* 10 January 1941, Battle of Taranto: a single Fulmar from &quot;Illustrious&quot; downed two SM.79s of 30° &quot;Stormo&quot;.
* 20–22 April 1941: one SM.79 (278ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, torpedo unit) was shot down on the 21st, another, from 34° &quot;Gruppo&quot; was shot down the next day, by Fulmars from 
* 8 May 1941, Operation Tiger: two SM.79s (38°&quot;Gruppo&quot;) were downed by the &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s Fulmars
* 21–25 July 1941, Operation Substance: 23 July, one SM.79 (38th) and two (283rd) torpedo bombers and on the 25th, one SM.79 (89th &quot;Gruppo&quot;) were shot down, all by Fulmars from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;.
* 12–17 June 1942, Operation Harpoon: Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes downed four SM.79s of 36° &quot;Stormo&quot; (torpedo-bombers) on 14 June. On 15 June another SM.79 (52° &quot;Gruppo&quot;) was shot down.
* 10–15 August 1942, Operation Pedestal: two SM.79s (109° and 132° &quot;Gruppo&quot;) were downed on 12 August.

The total number of reconnaissance, bomber and torpedo bombers downed in these two years by naval fighters was, not counting aircraft heavily damaged and eventually lost, 24 aircraft, 2% of total production.

A major safety issue in the operation of the SM.79 was the difference between the calculated and effective range figures, which led to several mishaps. Two accidents highlight the deficiencies in range of the Sparvieros.

One such incident befell the ferry flight of 27th Gruppo. This unit was transferred from Alghero to North Africa. The 16 Sparvieros took off at 11:50 of 4 April 1941, but one of the eight aircraft of the 18ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot; in the first wave had an accident and crashed on the airport strip. The other eight from 52ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot; could only take off 40 minutes later, while the first seven circled over the airfield. The 15 Sparvieros flew together until reaching Misurata, but the 18th squadriglia had flown for much longer and was short of fuel. Subsequently, its SM.79s crashed one after the other with only two landing safely. At least two were completely destroyed, and three damaged. On that day, on a simple ferry flight of 1,100 km, the 18th lost five Sparvieros and at least one crew, with many wounded. The flight of 52ª Sq lasted for 4 hours and 45 mins but 18ª Sq flew for 5h and 15 mins, without any payload, at an average speed of only 210 km/h.

=== MM. 23881 ===

Another such incident involved &quot;MM.23881&quot; of the 278th, which took off from Berka on 21 April 1941, piloted by Captain Oscar Cimolini, with the intention of searching for enemy shipping near Crete. After an attack around 20:00 hours, it began the trip back to its base. The crew became disoriented and, unable to communicate due to a broken radio, missed their airfield in bad weather conditions. Exhausting their fuel supply the aircraft made a forced landing some away from its base. Some of the crew of six had suffered some injuries, but at least one crew member was able to leave to search for help. He walked for over in the desert, was overcome and died only eight kilometres from the Jalo–Giarabub road, where his remains were found by chance in 1960.
Subsequent searches found the still largely intact SM.79 on 5 October 1960. The skeleton of one crew member (probably the pilot) was found still inside the cockpit; two more bodies were found outside the wreck. The other two crew members were never found; the finding of an additional clock on Romanini&#x27;s body indicated that at least another crewman had accompanied him through the desert, but had died earlier on the march.

==Surviving aircraft==

There are two surviving complete SM.79s, both of which were donated by Lebanon to the Italian Air Force:

;Italy
* MM24499 – SM.79 on static display at the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics in Trento, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.
* MM45508 – SM.79 on static display at the Italian Air Force Museum in Bracciano, Lazio.

In addition to the above complete examples, the remains of the SM.79 wrecked by LRDG R patrol are still at the western landing ground at Jebel Uweinat.

<text>Lorenzo Taezaz (30 June 1900 – 23 June 1947) was an Ethiopian official in diplomatic affairs. He served as Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s diplomatic representative during the Emperor&#x27;s exile in Britain following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, being the permanent delegate from Ethiopia to the League of Nations. After the restoration of the Ethiopian government, Lorenzo was Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Posts and Telegraph, and served in the Ethiopian Senate.

Lorenzo Taezaz was born in the Akele Guzay province of Eritrea, then an Italian colony. One source believes he received his earliest education in Italian schools in Asmara and Keren, although Bahru Zewde believes he studied at the Swedish mission school in Asmara. Following a chance meeting with &quot;Ras&quot; Taferi Makonnen (the later Emperor Haile Selassie), he received a scholarship to study in France, and spent eight years at the University of Montpellier, where he received his doctorate in Law. On returning to Ethiopia, he became the second Consul General of Ethiopia to Eritrea after Lij Seifu Mikael was recalled to takeover Hakim Workneh Eshete&#x27;s job as governor of the lucrative Chercher region upon Hakim Workneh&#x27;s departure to London representing Ethiopia, he then served in the Ministry of Justice, and was a member of the Anglo-Ethiopian Boundary Commission which demarcated Ethiopia&#x27;s borders with former British Somaliland, and that later investigated the causes of the Walwal Incident of 1934. Lorenzo is said to have seen action at the Battle of Maychew in 1936. He literally followed Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s departure from Ethiopia, riding on the next train to Djibouti, along with three Swedish officers, most of the ministers and other notables of the Imperial court. 

After Haile Selassie addressed the League of Nations, and after Lorenzo was appointed Permanent Delegate to that body, although during the Italian occupation, he secretly entered Ethiopia on several occasions for the Emperor. One such occasion was in November 1940, when he accompanied three elders who were returning to Armachiho in northern Ethiopia after waiting in Khartoum for help from the British; another was not long after this, he travelled to Kenya where he aided in organizing Ethiopian soldiers who had been interned there for years, having fled there not long after the Italian conquest in 1937.

After Haile Selassie&#x27;s return to Ethiopia, Lorenzo was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs (1941–1943), and subsequently Minister for Posts, Telephones and Telegrams (1943). According to Bahru Zewde, Lorenzo came into conflict with the powerful &quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot; (&quot;Minister of the Pen&quot;) Wolde Giyorgis Wolde Yohannes, who had him appointed to the ceremonial President of the Chamber of Deputies (1943–1944), then ambassador to the Soviet Union (November 1944) -- effectively exiled from the center of power, then a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference (May 1946); after being in Sweden for only a month, he died in a hospital in Stockholm.

<doc id="494342" wikidata="Q1401550" url="?curid=494342" title="Public holidays in the Czech Republic">
<text>[[Public holiday]]s in the Czech Republic are defined by Act No. 245/2000, on national (public) holidays, on other holidays, on significant days and on days off from work. In addition to public holidays, this law also defines other holidays and significant days . Public holidays and other holidays are non-working days, significant days are working days (unless they fall on a Saturday or Sunday). Public holidays (unlike other holidays) &quot;should remind citizens of the traditions, noble goals and historical twists and turns on which Czech statehood is built&quot;.

On some national and other holidays, the opening hours of some stores are limited by law.

== Restrictions on sales on public holidays ==
Since 2016, stores over 200 square meters must remain closed on New Year&#x27;s Day, Easter Monday, Liberation Day (8 May), Statehood Day (28 September), Independent Czechoslovak State Day (28 October) and both Christmas Days (25 and 26 December). They must also close at noon on 24 December because this day most Czechs celebrate Christmas.

The closures do not apply to all stores. Small minimarkets and grocery stores with area smaller than 200 square metres (~2153 square feet) can remain open. Pharmacies, gas stations, shops at railway stations (including Prague&#x27;s Hlavní nádraží), airports and hospitals are exempt.

<text>Oliver Phelps (October 21, 1749February 21, 1809) was an American politician. He was early in life a tavern keeper in Granville, Massachusetts. During the Revolution he was Deputy Commissary of the Continental Army and served until the end of the war. After the war ended, he was appointed a judge, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and became a land speculator in western New York state. A depressed real estate market forced him to sell most of his holdings.

== Personal life==
Phelps was born in Poquonock in the Connecticut Colony. His father, Thomas Phelps, died in Oliver&#x27;s first year of life, and his mother was left to raise their seventeen children. Phelps took a job at age seven in a local store to help support his family.

When he was 21 in 1770, Oliver and his young wife Mary moved to Suffield, where he apprenticed to a local merchant, and in 1770 the couple moved to Granville, where he opened his own store.

==Career ==
At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, Phelps joined the Continental Army and fought in the Battle of Lexington. He left the service in 1777 and, relying on his experience as a merchant, became Massachusetts Superintendent of Purchases of Army Supplies, a Deputy Commissary of the Continental Army. He was introduced to Robert Morris, the great financier of Revolutionary times. He supplied troops and received commendation from General George Washington for his efforts. He was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1778 to 1780 and a member of the Federal Constitutional Convention in 1779 and 1780. After the war ended, he became a prominent businessman and was elected to the Massachusetts Senate in 1785 and served on the Governor&#x27;s council in 1786. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Eighth United States Congress, holding office from March 4, 1803, to March 3, 1805, and ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1804 on the ticket headed by Aaron Burr.

===Land speculation===

The connections he established during the Revolutionary War aided his efforts in forming in 1788 a syndicate with Nathaniel Gorham, also a former member of the Federal Constitutional Convention. They organized a company of speculators, retaining 82 shares for themselves, and brought in competing companies to join in their effort. They sold 15 shares to the Niagara Company, composed of Colonel John Butler, Samuel Street, and other Tory friends of the Indians, and another 23 shares were divided among 21 persons. Following the American Revolution, there remained a confusing collection of contradictory royal charters from James I, Charles I, and Charles II, mixed with a succession of treaties with the Dutch and with the Indians, which made the legal situation intractable. Massachusetts owned land west of the &quot;Preemption Line&quot; in New York that was disconnected geographically from the rest of the state. New York and Massachusetts reached a compromise settling their competing claims for the region in December 1786 with the signing of the Treaty of Hartford. The syndicate lobbied for a law that was passed by the Massachusetts legislature that enabled them to buy land, payable over three years, using Massachusetts Consolidated Scrip, which was worth about 20 cents on a dollar at the time.

On July 4–8, 1788 a council was held with chiefs of the Five Nations of Indian at Buffalo Creek. Phelps was the active agent for the syndicate and negotiated with the Indians to purchase their title to the land. The Indians considered themselves to be the owners of the land, but Phelps persuaded the Chiefs that since they had been allies to the defeated British during the Revolutionary War, and since the British had given up the lands in the 1783 peace treaty, the tribes could only expect to retain whatever lands the United States would allow them to keep. Phelps and Gorham wanted to buy , but the Indians refused to sell the rights to any land west of the Genesee River. Phelps suggested that the Indians could take advantage of a grist mill to grind their maize which would relieve the women of the grinding work. The Indians asked how much land was needed for a grist mill, and Phelps suggested a section of land wide and deep, about , along the western bank of the river. Phelps and Gorham finally bought the rights to including a tract on the west bank of the river later named Mill Yard Tract where they planned to locate a saw mill and grist mill. The Indians were later much amazed that so large a tract of land was needed for the grist mill.

They paid US$1 million (about £300,000), or less than 25 cents per acre, between 1787 and 1788.

At first Phelps and Gorham thought they would make the site of current-day Geneva their headquarters, but discovered that their survey had somehow left that site just east of their boundary. So they chose Canandaigua, New York, at the head of Canandaigua Lake, as the seat of the new Ontario County. The name Canandaigua is derived from the Iroquois word &quot;Kanandarque&quot; which means &quot;chosen spot&quot;. It was the site of the principal village of the Seneca Indians, burned by the whites during the war in the Sullivan Expedition.

===Builds home in Suffield ===
After the purchase, Phelps returned to Suffield, Connecticut, and bought what was later named the Hatheway House from its builder Shem Burbank, who as a Tory sympathizer during the American Revolution had suffered financial difficulties afterward. Phelps spent generously on furnishings for the home, hired servants, and added a wing to the home in 1794, a display of his wealth and an &quot;architectural masterpiece&quot; that still features original Paris-made wallpaper.

He opened one of the first land sales offices in the U.S. in Suffield and another in Canandaigua. During the next two years he and his partners sold at a higher price to a number of buyers. But land sales failed to raise enough capital to meet their payment requirements, and in August 1790 they sold to U.S. Senator Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, who Phelps had done business with during the Revolutionary War. Morris paid eight pence half penny or between 11 and 12 cents per acre, about half of what Phelps and Gorham had paid. They retained only two townships totaling for themselves. Morris almost immediately sold the land to an English syndicate for £75,000 (about $333,000), netting a good profit.

Phelps was appointed the first judge of Ontario County (1789–1793), even before he moved to Canandaigua in 1792. He built the first framed house in Canandaigua and a grist mill. Phelps retained extensive holdings in the infant Ontario County. He maintained an interest in its affairs and in further land speculations. He was a founder and the largest stock holder in the Hartford National Bank and Trust Co. He was also the largest financial contributor to the Hamilton-Oneida Academy built in 1793 by Samuel Kirkland on acres he donated. Kirkland, a Presbyterian minister and missionary among the Oneida, had aided Phelps in his land purchase from the Indians and had received acres from the Oneidas and New York State. He was also appointed the first judge of Ontario County and served in Congress between 1803 and 1805.

=== Loses land holdings and home ===
Later in 1789, the value of the Massachusetts scrip had risen to par value and substantially inflated the cost to purchase the remaining which they had not yet obtained title to from the Indians. They gave up their contract for the land instead. Despite his remaining, vast land holdings, changing money values affected the mortgages held on the tracts of land and a depressed land market caused Phelps to get into financial difficulty. In August 1790, the reverses forced him to sell his Suffield home and his interest in the Hartford National Bank and Trust Co.

He continued to invest in land and by 1796 had purchased roughly a million acres of land along the Mississippi River. He also helped organize the Connecticut Land Company which for $1,200,000 bought all but the extreme western portion of the Connecticut Western Reserve in the Northwest Territory from the state of Connecticut. Phelps borrowed heavily to finance the company. In 1796, his creditors demanded payment. Facing the possibility of debtors&#x27; prison, Phelps went into seclusion. In 1802 he moved to Canandaigua, New York, and he served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1803 to 1805.

==Family==
He married Mary Seymour, daughter of Zachariah Seymour and Sarah ( Steele) Seymour. Together, they were the parents of a son and a daughter:

* Oliver Leicester Phelps (1775–1813), who married Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Law Sherman, a daughter of William Sherman and granddaughter of founding father Roger Sherman.
* Mary Phelps (1778–1859), who married Amasa Jackson, the first president of the Union Bank of New York; he was a son of General Michael Jackson, who commanded a regiment of minutemen in the Battle of Lexington.

Purchasers of his land had continued difficulty paying off the mortgage loans which he held. He tried to help those who had bought his land contracts but who could not fulfill their contracts, and Phelps died on February 21, 1809, in the town he sold and helped develop. He was interred in the Pioneer Cemetery in Canandaigua, New York.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Mary, he was a grandfather of Harriet Jackson (1804–1868), who married John Albert Granger, son of U.S. Postmaster General Gideon Granger and younger brother to U.S. Representative Francis Granger.

* Seiyo
* Tobe

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Uchiko has decreased steadily since the 1950s.

== History ==
The area of Uchiko was part of ancient Iyo Province and prospered since ancient times as an important transportation hub on the Ōzu Highway and as a transit point for the Shikoku Pilgrimage. During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Ōzu Domain or its semi-subsidiary, Niiya Domain. The town of Uchikoi was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on December 1, 1889. From the Edo period to the Meiji period, it prospered in the production of Japanese paper and Japanese wax. In particular, Japanese wax became famous overseas for its high quality, accounting for about 30% of the national production at its peak. At that time the Yokaichi and Gokoku districts became industrialised and their historical houses still retain some vestige of Uchiko’s former glory. In the Yokaichi and Gokoku districts is a street of merchant houses, which have solemn white or cream coloured plaster walls, lattices, decorative walls and old-style Japanese desks. This traditional street is about 600 meters long and around 90 of these historical houses are still lived in. After the Taisho period (1912-1926), Japan wax production declined due to the spread of oil and electricity. In 1982, its historic townscape was designated as an &quot;Important Preservation District for Groups of Traditional Buildings&quot;. On January 1, 2005, the town of Ikazaki, from Kita District; and the town of Oda, from Kamiukena District, were merged into Uchiko.

The soil is fertile and leaf tobacco, shiitake mushrooms, and fruits such as persimmons, grapes and nashi pears make use of the sloping land, opening the way for tourist orchards.. The riversides are used mainly by farms and farmland can extend to the hills and the steep mountainsides.

<text>is a small peninsula town located in Nishiuwa District, Ehime Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 8,497 in 15638 households and a population density of 90 persons per km2. The total area of the town is 

Following a recent merger with the neighboring towns of Misaki and Seto, the town now spans the mountainous Sadamisaki Peninsula, the narrowest peninsula in Japan and the westernmost point on the island of Shikoku.

This unique geography has greatly influenced Ikata&#x27;s growth. On the one hand, it has presented significant challenges to urban development that were not overcome until recently in the town&#x27;s long history. On the other, the peninsula is what gives the town its beautiful mountain and ocean scenery which, bolstered by significant investments in infrastructure and tourist facilities, has formed the basis for a burgeoning tourism industry.

In addition to the beauty of its rugged, natural landscape, Ikata has long been known for fishing and mikan orange farming. In recent years Ikata has also become a hotspot of modern energy production—the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant produced much of Shikoku&#x27;s electricity until it was shut down in 2012 following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami (before being reactivated in 2018), and the town&#x27;s windy mountains are dotted by dozens of windmills.

==Geography==
Ikata is on the Sadamisaki Peninsula, Japan&#x27;s narrowest peninsula and the westernmost point on the island of Shikoku. The peninsula is extremely mountainous, with steep cliffs and precious little usable flat land. To combat this, the town&#x27;s bays and ponds have seen vigorous coastal reclamation efforts dating back to the early Meiji period (late 1800s). Ikata&#x27;s mountainsides are covered with terraced mikan fields, and natural forest in the undeveloped areas.

The various neighborhoods of Ikata are found nestled among the foothills of the mountains, connected only by winding coastal roads and a single highway, Route 197. The biggest of the neighborhoods and the administrative center of Ikata is Minatoura, near the eastern edge of the town.

Ikata is surrounded on three sides by ocean—the Iyo Sea (part of the Inland Sea) to the north, the Uwa Sea (Pacific Ocean) to the south, and the Hōyo Strait (separating Shikoku from Kyūshū) to the west.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
*Ehime Prefecture
**Yawatahama

===Climate===
The climate in Ikata is warm, with an average year-round temperature of and 1,500 ml of yearly rain. The coldest parts of winter remain above freezing (5 °C or 41 °F on average), with snowfall seen only once or twice per year. Rain is concentrated in the rainy season in June and July, and also in September.

The length of the peninsula makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, it is not uncommon to find it sunny between one set of tunnels, rainy between another, and foggy between yet another. Ikata&#x27;s position, stretching out into the ocean, also makes it a frequent target for typhoons.

==Demographics==

Ikata is a small town, with a population of 8,196 as of June 30, 2023. The total land area of the town is 94.37 km2, making the population density 113 persons per km2. However, much of the land on the peninsula is quite mountainous and not suited for development; the population density of the individual settlements, which are squeezed into the small bay areas in the foothills of the mountains, is much higher. Extrapolating from data based on the most recent land survey, only 3.21% of the town&#x27;s land is inhabited; this puts the population density at a much higher 3,510 persons/kilometer-squared.

Like much of rural Japan, Ikata faces a rapidly declining and aging population. According to the Ikata website, roughly 40% of the town&#x27;s population is 65 or older. Furthermore, many elementary and middle schools have closed since the 1970s. Those that remain have very small student populations. For example, Ikata Elementary School is Ikata&#x27;s largest elementary school; there were 303 students in 1987, 162 in 2006, and 128 in 2014; Toyonoura Elementary was Old Ikata&#x27;s smallest school; it had 51 students in 1987, and only 14 in 2007. before it closed in 2010. Currently, Futami Elementary is Ikata&#x27;s smallest Elementary school with 21 students. However, plans are in effect to close the school at the end of the current fiscal year (April, 2015).
This population issue was a significant part of the impetus for the recent merger of Old Ikata with Seto and Misaki. While Old Ikata is geographically more accessible, and has enjoyed the economic benefits of the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, Seto and Misaki have experienced even more severe aging and decline of their populations. In 2000, Seto&#x27;s working-age population dipped below 50% of its total.

Ethnically Ikata is extremely homogeneous with only a handful of non-Japanese residents, most of whom are either temporary farm laborers from China, or English educators on the JET Programme.

Per Japanese census data, the population of Ikata has been decreasing steadily since the 1950s, and is now less than third of what it was a century ago.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The Sadamisaki Peninsula area has been inhabited since at least the Jōmon period (10,000–300 BC), as evidenced by the discovery of stone tools and earthenware pots in the Misaki and Kushi neighborhoods.

In 1963 a local man discovered a stone ax dating to the mid-Yayoi period (300 BC–250 AD) in his farm plot in the Kawachi neighborhood. Upon further investigation by the Japan Archaeological Society in 1986, the area was recognized as containing the remains of a . This is a type of settlement usually located several tens of meters above the surrounding area on mountainsides, and is peculiar to the Yayoi period.

===Classical era===
After the Taika Reform of 646, Ikata and the greater surrounding area became known as the Uwa District in 701. The Uwa District covered the entire Nanyo region (map) until it was split in two in 866. Since districts were defined by population, one can infer that the area was underdeveloped and sparsely populated at the time.

===Feudal era===

Towards the end of the Heian period, the Yawatahama and Ikata area became known as . As ownership of farmlands became increasingly concentrated in the hands of local ruling families, control of the Yano area was given to Taira no Tadamitsu, a member of the Heike clan.

Some members of the Heike family secretly settled in the Seto area in 1185 after being defeated in the Genpei Wars.

Entering the Edo period and the Tokugawa shogunate, the Uwa District came under control of the . From 1610 to 1612, the first Uwajima feudal lord, Tomita Nobutaka, gathered farmers from the local area to dig a canal through the thinnest part of the Sadamisaki Peninsula, Seto&#x27;s Mitsukue neighborhood. The project was soon canceled due to insufficient funds. By this time, the name can be seen in records of taxes paid to the feudal lords.The Mitsukue neighborhood prospered as a port town during the feudal period, as it was used as a port of rest for &quot;daimyō&quot; on their way to and from the capital as part of the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system. This traffic was likely the source of the demand for Nobutaka&#x27;s abortive attempt to create a shortcut through the peninsula.

===Modern era===

A decade after the Meiji Restoration, in March 1878 the Uwa District was divided into the current Kitauwa, Minamiuwa, Higashiuwa, and Nishiuwa districts (North-, South-, East-, and West-Uwa, respectively). Ikata was designated a in 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system, and other neighborhoods along the peninsula soon followed suit, many merging to reduce the number of independent settlements from 26 to 6.

More recently, Seto&#x27;s Mitsukue Bay was used for submarine training operations by the Imperial Japanese Navy leading up to World War II, as the bay&#x27;s shape is similar to that of Pearl Harbor. A monument named stands in Suka Park in Mitsukue as a memorial dedicated to the nine young men (ages 21–28) who were stationed in the Mitsukue area for these exercises. According to the plaque on the monument, the men were quite friendly with the locals, and stories are still told about them in the neighborhood to this day. The men died on December 8, 1941, during one of the initial attacks on Pearl Harbor.

In 1955 another round of mergers corresponding to the Great Shōwa Merger reduced the number of municipal entities to three.

In 1977 the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant began operation as the first nuclear power plant on the island of Shikoku.

On April 1, 2005, Ikata merged with the nearby towns of Misaki and Seto to create the new town of Ikata, which spans the Sadamisaki Peninsula.

The installation of many new windmills in 2006 and 2007 solicited a significant amount of noise complaints from nearby residents.

On March 2014, national attention turned to Ikata as the towns elections near. Many wondered if Ikata would approve the restart of its nuclear power generators.

===Timeline===
*March 1878 — Meiji reforms create the Nishiuwa District
*1889 — Ikata is designated a village.
*March 31, 1955 — The villages of Ikata and Machimi merge, forming the old town of Ikata
*September 30, 1977 — Reactor No. 1 of the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant begins operation
*April 1, 2005 — The towns of Misaki and Seto were merged into Ikata to form the new and expanded town of Ikata

==Government and politics==
Ikata has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 13 members. Ikata together with Yawatahama, contributes two members to the Ehime Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, Ikata is part of Ehime 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Prior to 2022, the town was part of Ehime 4th district.

Ikata experienced significant political turbulence leading up to and immediately following the April 1, 2005 merger with Seto and Misaki. To begin with, multiple potential merger plans were put forth, one of which was for all of the Nishiuwa District towns (Misaki, Seto, Old Ikata, and Honai) to merge. However, when Honai announced that it would merge with the nearby city of Yawatahama, polls indicated that Misaki residents still preferred to merge with Honai and Yawatahama, rather than Seto and Old Ikata, despite their being discontiguous (a Misaki-Honai-Yawatahama merger would make Misaki an exclave). Ultimately this was found to be impractical, and the Misaki-Seto-Ikata merger was approved with some grumbling over the naming of the new town. Once the merger was decided upon, suggestions for the new town&#x27;s name were solicited from the residents. Despite the many other reasonable suggestions and the seeming unfairness toward Seto and Misaki, the &quot;new&quot; name was chosen to be &quot;Ikata.&quot;

Following the merger a heated mayoral race was held, with 11 members of incumbent Kiyoyoshi Nakamoto&#x27;s campaign arrested for electoral fraud. Challenger &quot;Yoshihisa Hatanaka&quot; ultimately won, only to be arrested in February 2006 for corruption relating to government construction contracts. He resigned soon thereafter. A second race was held in April 2006, with Kazuhiko Yamashita defeating rival Kiyohiko Takakado by only 90 votes. Voter turnout was 87.43%.

There has been and remains political resistance among some Ikata residents to the nuclear power plant.

The most recent mayoral election took place on April 13, 2014 which found incumbent Yamashita in seat for his third term as mayor. 85.33% of the total 9,190 eligible voters turning out to cast a ballot. Mr. Yamashita garnered a total of 3,266 of the electorate while a certain Mr. Yoshihisa Hatanaka (see above) came in second place with a total of 2,399 votes. A non-Ikata resident of the &quot;People Who Don&#x27;t Need Nukes&quot; Party (原発いらない人々) managed to win slightly more than 1% of the electorate with 104 votes.

==Economy==
Ikata&#x27;s main industries are farming (largely citrus fruits such as mikans), fishing, and electrical power. Ikata produces a substantial fraction of Shikoku&#x27;s electricity. There are two main power production methods currently in use.

===Wind power===
The former town of Seto erected eleven Mitsubishi MWT-1000 wind generators in January 2002. The Old Ikata installed two Vestas V52-850 kW generators in March 2005. Together they have an expected yearly energy output of 34,700 MWh.

Ikata is investing heavily in wind power infrastructure, with 45 additional towers currently under construction. The town plans to have a total of 60 generators within the next few years.

===Nuclear power===
Ikata is the site of Shikoku&#x27;s only nuclear power plant. The Ikata Nuclear Power Plant has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe Pressurized Water Reactor units with the Two Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the original Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi Pressurized Water Reactor unit with the Three Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30, 1977 and March 19, 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15, 1994.

April 1, 2007, marked a milestone for the Ikata plant as it reached a total of 300 million kilowatt-hours of energy generated since beginning operations in 1977.

==Education==
Ikata has six public elementary schools and three public middle schools operated by the city government. The city has one public high school operated by the Ehime Prefectural Board of Education.

==Transportation==
===Railways===
Ikata has no passenger rail service. The closest station is the JR Shikoku Yawatahama Station on the Yosan Line.

===Highways===
====Background====
Due to Ikata&#x27;s length and mountainous terrain, regular bus service did not reach the tip of the peninsula until the 1960s. Until then, the only public transportation available was local ferries that connected the bays of each neighborhood. In 1963, the original Japan National Route 197 was completed. It follows the coastline, and is thus extremely winding and narrow, with very little room for cars to pass. Traversing the peninsula by this route takes hours and can be quite nerve-wracking; this earned it the ire of the locals, who came up with a disparaging nickname that is a pun on the actual name: .

====Modern day====

The Ikata leg of the new National Route 197 was completed in 1987 and is the heart of transportation in modern Ikata, affectionately nicknamed &quot;Melody Line&quot;. This nickname later spawned a musical road portion of the road built to celebrate its anniversary that was completed and added in 2011, so the road could literally have a &quot;melody&quot;. The road &quot;plays&quot; parts of two Japanese songs when certain sections of the road are driven over. Unlike the old roads, Melody Line boasts two full lanes and runs relatively straight down the peninsula. Seated high in the mountains, drivers can enjoy views of both the Pacific Ocean and Inland Sea. The route terminates at Misaki and continues over to Kyūshū by ferries that connect Misaki Port with Saganoseki (Ōita, Ōita) and Beppu, Ōita.

Melody Line is such an improvement over the old roads that it has become a significant Ehime sightseeing attraction in itself, with many tourists coming to see cherry blossoms in the spring. Together with the city of Iyo&#x27;s seaside Route 378, Melody Line makes one of the prefecture&#x27;s recommended sightseeing routes, and one of JTB&#x27;s .

Iyo Railway bus service runs up and down the peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, commuter buses run infrequently and, due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town&#x27;s neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.

==International relations==

Relations with Ikata&#x27;s only overseas sister city, Red Wing, Minnesota, USA, originally began as an exchange of technical knowledge and skills between engineers at the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant and Red Wing&#x27;s Prairie Island plant. The two towns became official sister cities in August 1995.

Since then, Ikata has put much effort into expanding the horizons of its residents through English language education via the JET Programme, and an annual international student exchange with Red Wing. Beginning in 1995, Ikata middle school students have traveled almost yearly to Red Wing for home stays of one to two weeks, and students from Red Wing likewise come to Ikata to learn about life in rural Japan.

Ikata&#x27;s high school, Misaki High School, maintains an exchange program with Australia.

Ikata has two sister cities, both of which also have nuclear power plants:
* Tomari, Hokkaidō, Japan, since February 1998
* Red Wing, Minnesota, United States, since August 1995

==Culture==

===Etymology of name===
The origin of the name &quot;Ikata&quot; is unclear and there are several competing theories.
*It may have come from or , meaning &quot;a place with small houses or shacks&quot;.
*&quot;Ika&quot; can be found in the names of places surrounded by mountains or located in foothills; &quot;ta&quot; can mean &quot;land&quot;. &quot;Ikata&quot; could therefore be &quot;a place by the mountains&quot;.
*In the Ainu language, &quot;ika&quot; means &quot;to pass through the mountains and cross the land&quot;. However, the Ainu are thought to have had little influence as far south as Shikoku.

===Food===
Ikata is known for its mikans and mikan juice. More than 20 different varieties of mikan are grown in Ikata. Old Ikata also has a very old sake brewing tradition that dates back to the Edo period, with several tōji brewmasters in the local area. There is even a museum dedicated to the Ikata Tōji.

The Seto area produces vegetables such as the bright-purple &quot;kintarō&quot; potato, and also catches baby sardines called . Misaki has a strong fishing tradition, producing many and . Four Misaki Fishing Co-op products are part of the Ehime brand: Horse mackerel, mackerel, , and .

One Ikata specialty cuisine is , a tempura-fried patty of pressed white fish meat and vegetables. Other variations include , which is the same but fried and breaded like tonkatsu, and which is prepared like a croquette.

===Language===
Residents of Ikata speak the Iyo dialect of Japanese, which is similar in many respects to the Hiroshima dialect. One feature particular to the Nanyo (southern Ehime) region is the use of the sentence-final particle &quot;ga&quot; (が) as a replacement for &quot;no&quot; (の) in some contexts. For example, &quot;Nani shiteru no?&quot; (何してるの？ &quot;What are you doing?&quot; in standard Japanese) becomes &quot;Nani shiyoru ga?&quot; (何しよるが？) in Iyo dialect.

Ikata&#x27;s largest town celebration in late summer, the Kinahaiya Ikata Festival, is another example of the Iyo dialect—&quot;kinahai ya&quot; (来なはいや) literally means &quot;come on over&quot; (&quot;kinasai yo&quot; 来なさいよ in standard Japanese).

The main attraction is the battle between the and the 4-meter tall , which are two ceremonial mikoshi floats carried by the young local men and women. Participants compete in repeatedly pulling the floats up along a giant 10-meter scaffold, then trying to drop theirs on top of the other.

:3 important deities and demons make their appearance at most of Ikata&#x27;s autumn festivals.

1.

2.
:The Karashishi is most notably found in Japan at the entrance of Shinto Shrines and are used to either ward-off bad spirits or welcome good spirits. The Karashishi dance in Ikata involves two persons dancing under a single guardian lion costume to the beat of the drum of a young boy. Ikata&#x27;s performers are especially well-known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication to the dance.

3.
:Although the origins of the five-deer dance are unknown, it is said that its traditions were brought over from Uwajima during the period. (1624-1644) Especially popular at the time, many believe that it first made its appearance in Ikata at then Kawanagata-ura (川永田浦).

<text>The London sewer system is part of the water infrastructure serving London, England. The modern system was developed during the late 19th century, and as London has grown the system has been expanded. It is currently owned and operated by Thames Water and serves almost all of Greater London.

==History==
During the early 19th century the River Thames was an open sewer, with disastrous consequences for public health in London, including cholera epidemics. These were caused by enterotoxin-producing strains of the bacterium &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;. Although the contamination of the water supply was correctly diagnosed by Dr John Snow in 1849 as the method of communication, up to the outbreak of 1866 it was believed that miasma, or bad air, was responsible. Proposals to modernise the sewerage system had been made in the early 1700s but the costs of such a project deterred progress. Further proposals followed in 1856, but were again neglected due to the costs. However, after the Great Stink of 1858, Parliament realised the urgency of the problem and resolved to create a modern sewerage system.

Joseph Bazalgette, a civil engineer and Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works, was given responsibility for the work. He and his colleagues, including William Haywood, designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the Thames Estuary, downstream of the main centre of population. Six main interceptor sewers, totalling almost 160 km (100 miles) in length, were constructed, some incorporating stretches of London&#x27;s &quot;lost&quot; rivers. Three of these sewers were north of the river, the southernmost, low-level one being incorporated in the Thames Embankment. The Embankment also allowed new roads, new public gardens, and the Circle line of the London Underground. Victoria Embankment was finally officially opened on 13 July 1870.

The intercepting sewers, constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450 miles (720 km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000 miles (21,000 km) of smaller local sewers. Construction of the interceptor system required 318 million bricks, of excavated earth and of concrete. The innovative use of Portland cement strengthened the tunnels, which were in good order 150 years later.

Gravity allows the sewage to flow eastwards, but in places such as Chelsea, Deptford and Abbey Mills, pumping stations were built to raise the water and provide sufficient flow. Many sewers north of the Thames feed into the Northern Outfall Sewer, which transports sewage to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works. South of the river, the Southern Outfall Sewer extends to a similar facility at Crossness. Smaller sewage treatment plants also serve areas further away from central London, such as at Mogden and Edmonton.

During the 20th century, major improvements were made to the sewerage system and to the sewage treatment provision to substantially reduce pollution of the Thames Estuary and the North Sea. The sewage works, from west to east, discharging into the tidal Thames in 1950-53 were:
==Modern development needs==

The original system was designed to cope with 6.5 mm (1/4&quot;) per hour of rainfall within the catchment area, and supported a smaller population than today&#x27;s. London&#x27;s growth has put pressure on the capacity of the sewerage system. During storms, for example, high levels of rainfall (in excess of 6 mm per hour) in a short period of time can overwhelm the system. Sewers and treatment works are unable to cope with the large volumes of rainwater entering the system. Rainwater mixes with sewage in combined sewers and excess mixed water is discharged into the Thames. If this does not happen quickly enough, localised flooding occurs (surcharge). Such sanitary sewer overflow can mean streets becoming flooded with a mixture of water and sewage, causing a health risk.

In redeveloping the Isle of Dogs and Royal Docks areas of east London during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the London Docklands Development Corporation invested in major new drainage infrastructure to manage future sewage and surface water run-off from proposed developments. Consulting engineer Sir William Halcrow &amp; Partners designed a system of large diameter tunnels served by new pumping stations. In the Royal Docks, approximately 16 miles (25 km) of foul and surface water drains were built, plus pumping stations at Tidal Basin (designed by Richard Rogers Partnership) and North Woolwich (architect: Nicholas Grimshaw). The Isle of Dogs drainage network is served by a stormwater pumping station situated in Stewart Street, designed by John Outram Associates.

===Thames Tideway Scheme===

Increasing the carrying capacity of London&#x27;s sewerage system has been debated for some years. The new &#x27;Thames Tideway&#x27; scheme includes a wide diameter storage-and-transfer tunnel (internal diameters of 7.2 m and 9 m have been suggested), 22 miles (35 km) long, underneath the riverbed of the Thames between Hammersmith in the west and Beckton/Crossness in the east. The cost of this megaproject is £4.9 billion, and it was completed in October 2024.

The anniversary of the annexation of the Galapagos Islands and Charles Darwin&#x27;s birthday are also celebrated on February 12 as Galapagos Day ( or ). This is sometimes described on the mainland as Amazon and Galapagos Day or Orient Day (), as the discovery of the headwaters of the Amazon River by Francisco de Orellana in 1542 is also recorded occurring on the same day.

<text>Coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands, in order to randomly choose between two alternatives. It is a form of sortition which inherently has two possible outcomes. The party who calls the side that is facing up when the coin lands wins.

== History ==
Coin flipping was known to the Romans as &quot;navia aut caput&quot; (&quot;ship or head&quot;), as some coins had a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the other.
In England, this was referred to as &quot;cross and pile&quot;.

==Process==
During a coin toss, the coin is thrown into the air such that it rotates edge-over-edge an unpredictable number of times. Either beforehand or when the coin is in the air, an interested party declares &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;, indicating which side of the coin that party is choosing. The other party is assigned the opposite side. Depending on custom, the coin may be caught; caught and inverted; or allowed to land on the ground. When the coin comes to rest, the toss is complete and the party who called correctly or was assigned the upper side is declared the winner.

It is possible for a coin to land on its side, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even on a flat surface it is possible for a coin to land on its edge. A computational model suggests that the chance of a coin landing on its edge and staying there is about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel.

The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides. Larger coins tend to be more popular than smaller ones. Some high-profile coin tosses, such as those in the Cricket World Cup and the Super Bowl, use custom-made ceremonial medallions.

===Three-way===
Three-way coin flips are also possible, by a different process – this can be done either to choose one or two out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, the previous is either reversed (the odd coin out is the &quot;winner&quot;) or a regular two-way coin flip between the two remaining players can decide. The three-way flip is 75% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, each of which occur 1/8 of the time due to the chances being 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.5, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; be called.
A well-known example of such a three-way coin flip (choose two out of three) is dramatized in &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (originally a book, subsequently film and TV series), wherein three Texas high school football teams use a three-way coin flip. A legacy of that particular 1988 coin flip was to reduce the use of coin flips to break ties in Texas sports, instead using point systems to reduce the frequency of ties.

===Larger numbers===

&quot;Heads and Tails&quot; or &quot;Heads or Tails&quot; is an informal game of chance using repeated coin tosses, suitable for a roomful of seated people, typically a social or children&#x27;s event. Initially all players stand. Before each coin toss, all still standing put their hands on either their head to indicate &quot;heads&quot; or their hips or buttocks to indicate &quot;tails&quot;; once the toss result is announced, those who guessed incorrectly sit down. The process repeats until the last player standing wins; often the last few players remaining are called to the announcer&#x27;s table for the climax. A variant with faster elimination is played with two coins and players placing each hand separately.

==Use in dispute resolution==
Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.
Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football, volleyball, and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The original XFL, a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style &quot;opening scramble,&quot; in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football, in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football. (The revived XFL, which launched in 2020, removed the coin toss altogether and allowed that decision to be made as part of a team&#x27;s home field advantage.)

In an association football match, the team winning the coin toss chooses which goal to attack in the first half; the opposing team kicks off for the first half. For the second half, the teams switch ends, and the team that won the coin toss kicks off. Coin tosses are also used to decide which team has the pick of going first or second in a penalty shoot-out. Before the early-1970s introduction of the penalty shootout, coin tosses were occasionally needed to decide the outcome of drawn matches where a replay was not possible. The most famous instance of this was the semifinal game of the 1968 European Championship between Italy and the Soviet Union, which finished 0–0 after extra time. Italy won, and went on to become European champions.
In cricket the toss is often significant, as the decision whether to bat or bowl first can influence the outcome of the game. The coin toss in cricket is more important than in other games because in many situations it can lead a team winning or losing the game. Factors such as pitch conditions, weather and the time of day are considered by the team captain who wins the toss. Now there are websites such as flip a coin online which domestic sports team use to toss the coin.

Similarly, in tennis a coin toss is used in professional matches to determine which player serves first. The player who wins the toss decides whether to serve first or return, while the loser of the toss decides which end of the court each player plays on first.

In duels a coin toss was sometimes used to determine which combatant had the sun at his back.
In some other sports, the result of the toss is less crucial and merely a way to fairly choose between two more or less equal options.

The National Football League also has a coin toss for tie-breaking among teams for playoff berths and seeding, but the rules make the need for coin toss, which is random rather than competitive, very unlikely. A similar procedure breaks ties for the purposes of seeding in the NFL Draft; these coin tosses are more common, since the tie-breaking procedure for the draft is much less elaborate than the one used for playoff seeding.

Major League Baseball once conducted a series of coin flips as a contingency on the last month of its regular season to determine home teams for any potential one-game playoff games that might need to be added to the regular season. Most of these cases did not occur. From the 2009 season, the method to determine home-field advantage was changed.

Fédération Internationale d&#x27;Escrime rules use a coin toss to determine the winner of some fencing matches that remain tied at the end of a &quot;sudden death&quot; extra minute of competition. Although in most international matches this is now done electronically by the scoring apparatus.

In the United States Asa Lovejoy and Francis W. Pettygrove, who each owned the claim to the land that would later become Portland, Oregon, wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns of Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine; Pettygrove won with the flip of a coin which has been preserved as the Portland Penny.

Scientists sometimes use coin flipping to determine the order in which they appear on the list of authors of scholarly papers.

In addition to its practical applications in sports, coin tossing is symbolic of the democratic principle of equal opportunity. When two parties face an impasse, the act of flipping a coin signifies a commitment to impartiality and a willingness to accept the outcome, no matter how arbitrary it may seem. This shared acceptance of chance as the ultimate arbiter can foster cooperation and conflict resolution in various aspects of life beyond sports, including business negotiations and interpersonal conflicts.

==Politics==

===Australia===
In December 2006, Australian television networks Seven and Ten, which shared the broadcasting of the 2007 AFL Season, decided who would broadcast the Grand Final with the toss of a coin. Network Ten won.

===Canada===
In some jurisdictions, a coin is flipped to decide between two candidates who poll equal number of votes in an election, or two companies tendering equal prices for a project. For example, a coin toss decided a City of Toronto tender in 2003 for painting lines on 1,605 km of city streets: the bids were $161,110.00 ($100.3800623 per km), $146,584.65 ($91.33 per km, exactly), and two equal bids of $111,242.55 ($69.31 per km, exactly).

===Philippines===
&quot;Drawing of lots&quot; is one of the methods to break ties to determine a winner in an election; the coin flip is considered an acceptable variant. Each candidate will be given five chances to flip a coin; the candidate with the most &quot;heads&quot; wins. The 2013 mayoral election in San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro was decided on a coin flip, with a winner being proclaimed after the second round when both candidates remained tied in the first round.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, if a local or national election has resulted in a tie where candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, then the winner can be decided either by drawing straws/lots, coin flip, or drawing a high card in pack of cards.

===United States===
In the United States, when a new state is added to the Union, a coin toss determines the class of the senators (i.e., the election cycle in which the term each of the new state&#x27;s senators will expire) in the US Senate. Also, a number of states provide for &quot;drawing lots&quot; in the event an election ends in a tie, and this is usually resolved by a coin toss or picking names from a hat. A 2017 election to the 94th District of the Virginia House of Delegates resulted in a tie between Republican incumbent David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds, with exactly 11,608 votes each. Under state law, the election was to be decided by drawing a name from a bowl, although a coin toss would also have been an acceptable option. The chair of the Board of Elections drew the film canister with Yancey&#x27;s name, and he was declared the winner. Additionally, the outcome of the draw determined control of the entire House, as Republicans won 50 of the other 99 seats and Democrats 49. A Yancey win extended the Republican advantage to 51–49, whereas a Simmonds win would have resulted in a 50–50 tie. As there is no provision for breaking ties in the House as a whole, this would have forced a power sharing agreement between the two parties.

==Physics==
The outcome of coin flipping has been studied by the mathematician and former magician Persi Diaconis and his collaborators. They have demonstrated that a mechanical coin flipper which imparts the same initial conditions for every toss has a highly predictable outcomethe phase space is fairly regular. Further, in actual flipping, people exhibit slight bias&quot;coin tossing is fair to two decimals but not to three. That is, typical flips show biases such as 0.495 or 0.503.&quot;

In studying coin flipping, to observe the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, so that when the speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coinafter a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time.

Moreover, their theoretical analysis of the physics of coin tosses predicts a slight bias for a caught coin to be caught the same way up as it was thrown, with a probability of around 0.51, though a 2009 attempt to verify this experimentally at Berkeley with 40,000 tosses gave ambiguous results. A much larger 2023 University of Amsterdam study (which won a 2024 Ig Nobel Prize) performed 350,757 tosses, finding an average same-side bias of 50.8%, but which varied from person to person.

Since the images on the two sides of actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to slightly favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing. Coin spinning is much more likely to be biased than flipping.

Stage magicians and gamblers, with practice, are able to greatly increase the same-side-up bias, whilst still making throws which are visually indistinguishable from normal throws. Conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun on a surface, they usually land on a particular face.

==Counterintuitive properties==

Human intuition about conditional probability is often very poor and can give rise to some seemingly surprising observations. For example, if the successive tosses of a coin are recorded as a string of &quot;H&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, then for any trial of tosses, it is twice as likely that the triplet TTH will occur before THT than after it. It is three times as likely that &quot;THH will precede HHT&quot; than that &quot;THH will follow HHT&quot;; see also Penney&#x27;s game.

==Mathematics==
The mathematical abstraction of the statistics of coin flipping is described by means of the Bernoulli process; a single flip of a coin is a Bernoulli trial. In the study of statistics, coin-flipping plays the role of being an introductory example of the complexities of statistics. A commonly treated textbook topic is that of checking if a coin is fair.

===Telecommunications===

There is no reliable way to use a true coin flip to settle a dispute between two parties if they cannot both see the coin—for example, over the phone. The flipping party could easily lie about the outcome of the toss. In telecommunications and cryptography, the following algorithm can be used:

# Alice and Bob each privately choose a random word, e.g. codice_1 and codice_2 respectively.
# Alice privately decides to call &quot;tails&quot; on the coin flip.
# Bob sends Alice his chosen word codice_2.
# Alice computes a cryptographic hash of a string that includes the two chosen words and the call (e.g. codice_4), and sends that hash (e.g. codice_5) to Bob.
# Bob performs the physical coin flip, and announces the result, heads or tails, to Alice.
# Alice reveals that the string she hashed was codice_4, including both of their words and a call of codice_7
# Bob confirms for himself that codice_5 is the hash of codice_4
# Both parties can now determine whether Alice&#x27;s call of &quot;tails&quot; matched Bob&#x27;s coin.

Bob, by providing his own random word, guarantees that Alice is not able to precompute an image pair of &quot;tail/random string&quot; or &quot;head/random string&quot;, for two different random words. Bob is also unable to reverse Alice&#x27;s hash to see what her chosen outcome was before flipping the coin, and to lie effectively about its outcome, because he does not know Alice&#x27;s random word at that point in the process.

==Lotteries==
The New Zealand lottery game Big Wednesday uses a coin toss. If a player matches all 6 of their numbers, the coin toss will decide whether they win a cash jackpot (minimum of NZ$25,000) or a bigger jackpot with luxury prizes (minimum of NZ$2 million cash, plus value of luxury prizes.) The coin toss is also used in determining the Second Chance winner&#x27;s prize.

==Clarifying feelings==
A technique attributed to Sigmund Freud to help in making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker&#x27;s feelings. He explained: &quot;I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I want you to do is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you&#x27;ll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision.&quot;

Danish poet Piet Hein&#x27;s 1966 book &quot;Grooks&quot; includes a poem, &quot;A Psychological Tip&quot;, on a similar theme:
