<text>The Belarusian Latin alphabet or Łacinka (from , , ) for the Latin script in general is the Latin script as used to write Belarusian. It is similar to the Sorbian alphabet and incorporates features of the Polish and Czech alphabets. Today, Belarusian most commonly uses the Cyrillic alphabet.

==Use==
Łacinka was used in the Belarusian area from the 16th century. After the annexation of the Belarusian territory by the Russian Empire, Łacinka was completely banned by the Russian authorities during 1859-1905 in order to facilitate the switch to the Cyrillic script and preferably to the Russian language. This ban ended in 1905, resulting in the active concurrent use of both Łacinka and the Belarusian Cyrillic script in numerous books and newspapers until the 1930s. Though during the time of the occupation of the western part of Belarus by the German Empire in 1914-1918, the Łacinka script was the only one allowed to be studied on the &quot;native language&quot; lessons because the Cyrillic script was banned there.

Nowadays Łacinka is used occasionally in its current form by certain authors, groups and promoters in the &quot;Naša Niva&quot; weekly, the &quot;ARCHE&quot; journal, and some of the Belarusian diaspora press on the Internet.

The system of romanisation in the Łacinka is phonological rather than orthographical, and thus certain orthographic conventions must be known. For instance, the Łacinka equivalent to Cyrillic &quot;&quot; can be &quot;je&quot; or &quot;ie&quot;, depending on its position in a word. Also, there is no soft sign in Łacinka; palatalisation is instead represented by a diacritic on the preceding consonant.

Instruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script is similar to Łacinka, but transliterates Cyrillic &quot;л&quot; in different ways: &quot;л&quot; = &quot;ł&quot; (Łacinka) = &quot;l&quot; (geographical), &quot;ль&quot; = &quot;l&quot; (Łacinka) = &quot;ĺ&quot; (geographical), &quot;ля&quot; = &quot;la&quot; (Łacinka) = &quot;lia&quot; (geographical). This may become a source of confusion because, for example, the Łacinka spelling of the word is indistinguishable from the geographical transliteration of a different word as they both look like &quot;stol&quot;. Whereas the changes of the actual Łacinka were never disruptive or ambiguous during its lifetime, digraphs &quot;sz/cz&quot; were even sometimes used along with their modernized diacritic &quot;š/č&quot; replacements in the same text.

==History==

In the 16th century, the first known Latin renderings of Belarusian Cyrillic text occurred, in quotes of Ruthenian in Polish and Latin texts. The renderings were not standardised, and Polish orthography seems to have been used for Old Belarusian sounds.

In the 17th century, Belarusian Catholics gradually increased their use of the Latin script but still largely in parallel with the Cyrillic. Before the 17th century, the Belarusian Catholics had often used the Cyrillic script.

In the 18th century, the Latin script was used, in parallel with Cyrillic, in some literary works, like in drama for contemporary Belarusian.

In the 19th century, some Polish and Belarusian writers of Polish cultural background sometimes or always used the Latin script in their works in Belarusian, notably Jan Čačot, Paŭluk Bahrym, Vincent Dunin-Marcinkievič, Francišak Bahuševič, and Adam Hurynovič. The Revolutionary Democrat Kastuś Kalinoŭski used only the Latin script in his newspaper &quot;Peasants’ Truth&quot; (, in Latin script: &quot;Mużyckaja prauda&quot;, or &quot;Mužyckaja praŭda&quot;; six issues in 1862–1863).

Such introduction of the Latin script for the language broke with the long Cyrillic tradition and is sometimes explained by the unfamiliarity of the 19th century writers with the history of the language or with the language itself or by the impossibility of acquiring or using the Cyrillic type at the printers that the writers had been using.

The custom of using the Latin script for Belarusian text gradually ceased to be common, but at the beginning of the 20th century, there were still several examples of use of the Latin script in Belarusian printing:

*Newspaper &quot;Naša Dola&quot; (1906).
*Newspaper &quot;Naša Niva&quot; (the issues during 10.11.1906 – 31.10.1912) — issues in both Cyrillic and Latin (with the subheading: &quot;Printed weekly in Russian and in Polish letters&quot; (in Latin script: &quot;Wychodzić szto tydzień ruskimi i polskimi literami&quot;)).
*Ciotka’s &quot;Belarusian Violin&quot; (, &quot;Skrypka biełaruskaja&quot;), &quot;Baptism to Freedom&quot; (, &quot;Chrest na swabodu&quot;) — books of poetry.
*Ciotka’s &quot;First reading for Belarusian children&quot; (, &quot;Perszaje czytannie dla dzietak-biełarusaŭ&quot;) — an attempt at creating a Belarusian elementary reading book.
*Janka Kupała’s &quot;Zither Player&quot; (, &quot;Huslar&quot;; 1910) — book of poetry.
* rev. Balasłaŭ Pačopka’s &quot;Belarusian Grammar&quot; (1915, publ. in 1918) — Belarusian grammar, based entirely on Latin script, but is claimed by Belarusian linguists, however, to be prepared unscientifically and breaking the traditions of the Belarusian language. See also Belarusian grammar.

In the 1920s in the Belarusian SSR, like the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926), some suggestions were made to consider a transition of the Belarusian grammar to the Latin script (for example, Źmicier Žyłunovič for &quot;making the Belarusian grammar more progressive&quot;). However, they were rejected by the Belarusian linguists (such as Vacłaŭ Łastoŭski).

From the 1920s to 1939, after the partition of Belarus (1921), the use of a modified Latin script was reintroduced to Belarusian printing in Western Belarus, chiefly for political reasons. The proposed form of the Belarusian Latin alphabet and some grammar rules were introduced for the first time in the 5th (unofficial) edition of Taraškievič&#x27;s grammar (Vilnia, 1929).

Belarusian was written in the Latin script in 1941 to 1944 in the German-occupied Belarusian territories and by the Belarusian diaspora in Prague (1920s – c.1945).

After the Second World War, Belarusian was occasionally written in the Latin script by the Belarusian diaspora in Western Europe and the Americas (notably in West Germany and the United States). In 1962, Jan Stankievič proposed a completely new Belarusian Latin alphabet.

==Today==

Nowadays, Łacinka is used rarely apart from some posters and badges. Yet, some books continue to be published in this script. For instance:
* Uładzimir Arłoŭ. 2015. &quot;Patria Aeterna. Apaviadańni&quot; [Patria Aeterna: Short Stories]. Minsk: A. N. Varaksin. 
* Ričardas Gavelis. 2018. &quot;Vilenski pokier&quot; [Vilnius Poker] (translated from the Lithuanian by Paŭlina Vituščanka). Vilnius: Logvino literatūros namai and Minsk: Lohvinaŭ. . NB: The paper book was published in Cyrillic in Taraškievica. Yet, the ebook is available in three orthographically and scriptaly different versions, namely, also in Łacinka and official orthography, apart from the faithful copy of the paper edition.
* Alhierd Bacharevič. 2022. &quot;Vieršy Вершы &quot; [Poems]. Prague: Vydaviectva Viasna Выдавецтва Вясна., 142pp. NB: Each poem is given in Łacinka and Cyrillic.
* Uładzimir Arłou. 2024. &quot;Śvieciacca vokny dy nikoha za jimi&quot; [Light in the Windows, but No One is There]. Białystok: Fundacja Kamunikat.org. , 226pp.
* In Vilnius since 1997 the magazine &quot;Рунь&quot; (&quot;Ruń&quot;, ISNN 1392-7671) has been published; recent issues of which include articles in both Cyrillic Taraškievica and Łacinka.

In late 2021 a VK project of the Latin alphabet-based Belarusian Wikipedia, that is, the Biełaruskaja Wikipedyja łacinkaj, commenced.

On the occasion of the International Mother Language Day (February 21) in 2023, a machine-converted website edition of &quot;Naša Niva&quot; in Łacinka was launched.

<doc id="489595" wikidata="Q2019583" url="?curid=489595" title="Piriform cortex">
<text>The piriform cortex, or pyriform cortex, is a region in the brain, part of the rhinencephalon situated in the cerebrum. The function of the piriform cortex relates to the sense of smell.

==Structure==
The piriform cortex is part of the rhinencephalon situated in the cerebrum.

In human anatomy, the piriform cortex has been described as consisting of the cortical amygdala, uncus, and anterior parahippocampal gyrus. More specifically, the human piriform cortex is located between the insula and the temporal lobe, anteriorly and laterally of the amygdala.

==Function==
The function of the piriform cortex relates to olfaction, which is the perception of smell. This has been particularly shown in humans for the posterior piriform cortex.

The piriform cortex in rodents and some primates has been shown to harbor cells expressing markers of plasticity such as doublecortin and PSA-NCAM which are modulated by the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system.

==Clinical significance==
The piriform cortex contains a critical, functionally defined epileptogenic trigger zone, &quot;Area Tempestas&quot;. From this site in piriform cortex chemical and electrically evoked seizures can be triggered. It is the site of action for the proconvulsant action of chemoconvulsants.

==Other animals==

Sometimes called the &quot;olfactory cortex&quot;, &quot;olfactory lobe&quot; or &quot;paleopallium&quot;, piriform cortical regions are present in the brains of amphibians, reptiles and mammals.

The piriform cortex is among three areas that emerge in the telencephalon of amphibians, situated caudally to a dorsal area, which is caudal to a hippocampal area. Further along the phylogenic timeline, the telencephalic bulb of reptiles as viewed in a cross section of the transverse plane extends with the archipallial hippocampus folding toward the midline and down as the dorsal area begins to form a recognizable cortex.

As mammalian brains developed, volume of the dorsal cortex increased in slightly greater proportion, as compared proportionally with increased overall brain volume, until it enveloped the hippocampal regions. Recognized as neopallium or neocortex, enlarged dorsal areas envelop the paleopallial piriform cortex in humans and Old World monkeys.

Among taxonomic groupings of mammals, the piriform cortex and the olfactory bulb become proportionally smaller in the brains of phylogenically younger species. The piriform cortex occupies a greater proportion of the overall brain and of the telencephalic brains of insectivores than in primates. The piriform cortex continues to occupy a consistent albeit small and declining proportion of the increasingly large telencephalon in the most recent primate species while the volume of the olfactory bulb becomes less in proportion.

<doc id="489597" wikidata="Q685925" url="?curid=489597" title="President of Guyana">
<text>The president of Guyana is the head of state and the head of government of Guyana, as well as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Republic, according to the Constitution of Guyana. The president is also the chancellor of the Orders of Guyana. Concurrent with their constitutional role as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, the president does not appoint a separate minister of defence. That portfolio is held by the president who fulfils all responsibilities designated to a minister of defence under the Defence Act.

==History and description==
When Guyana was declared a republic in 1970 the president was elected by the National Assembly for a five-year term and possessed largely ceremonial powers. President Arthur Chung was the only person to hold the office under those legal provisions. After a 1980 referendum, the constitution was amended to make the presidency an executive post (i.e. the office holder would be both the country&#x27;s head of state and its head of government) and the office became known as the executive president. Forbes Burnham was the first person to become president following these changes.

==Election==
According to Article 91 of the constitution, the president is elected by the people based on the votes cast in the parliamentary election (that is, using double simultaneous vote). Each list of contesting parties will on Nomination Day designate a member of their list as that party&#x27;s presidential candidate. The presidential candidate whose party&#x27;s list of candidates receives the most votes is deemed to be elected president and holds office for the legislature&#x27;s duration — which is, in practice, five years.

If two or more candidates who have more votes cast for them than any other candidate receive an equal number of votes, then under Article 177(3) of the constitution, the president shall be determined by drawing lots in the presence of the chancellor of the Judiciary and the public. This process of drawing lots to determine the president has never occurred in the history of Guyana since the creation of the presidency.

==Qualification for election==
To be qualified to be elected president, a candidate must:
* Be a citizen of Guyana by birth or parentage
* Have resided in Guyana for seven years before the date of the election
* Be qualified to be elected a member of the National Assembly, that is to say:
** Be a citizen of Guyana 18 years and older
** Be able to speak, and read the English language to an extent which would allow active participation in the proceedings of the National Assembly, unless an incapacity prevents this. In this case, this provision will not apply.

Concurrently, under article 155(1) of the constitution, and reinforced by a 2019 ruling of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Guyana, persons holding citizenship of Guyana and any other country (dual citizens) are not allowed to be members of the National Assembly, and consequently would not be eligible to be president.

==Oath of office==
Before entering into office, the person who has been elected or re-elected President must take and sign the following oath of office, the wording of which is specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution:

&quot;I (name) do hereby solemnly declare that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the People of Guyana that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana without fear or favour, affection or ill-will and that in the execution of the functions of that office I will honour, uphold, and preserve the Constitution of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.&quot;

The phrase &#x27;so help me God&#x27; is not specified in the constitution, but may be added at the end of the oath on the personal discretion of the president.

==Absence and vacancy of the office==
Whenever the president is out of Guyana or is absent from Guyana by reason of illness the prime minister, or - if the prime minister is already out of Guyana at the same time - any other minister designated by the president shall assume the office as acting president until the president is able to resume office.

The constitution also makes provision for a scenario where a president is too ill to transmit the above instructions. In the event this occurs, the temporary succession would proceed; however, the person acting as president is prevented from dissolving the National Assembly without the advice of the Cabinet, and may not revoke presidential appointments. The person acting as president will cease to do so when the permanent president informs them that they are well and able to resume office.

The office of president only becomes vacant in the following circumstances:
* If the holder of the office dies
* If the holder of the office resigns via a letter under their hand and addressed to the Speaker of the National Assembly
* If the holder of the office is removed for incapacity (under article 179 of the constitution)
* If the holder of the office is removed for violating the constitution or gross misconduct (under article 180 of the constitution)

Where a vacancy in the office exists in the above circumstances, the prime minister becomes the new substantive president rather than being an acting president.

==Order of succession==
If there is a vacancy in the office of president, Article 95(1) of the constitution makes provision for a &#x27;worst-case scenario&#x27; accounting for multiple levels of vacancy and specifies that the order of succession to the presidency shall be:
* The prime minister
(or if there is no prime minister)
* Any minister who is an elected member of the National Assembly as determined by the Cabinet
(or if there is no prime minister and no Cabinet)
* The chancellor of the judiciary

==Symbols of office==
===Cacique&#x27;s Crown===
The Cacique&#x27;s Crown is the personal emblem of the president of the Republic. Designated as such in 1970 when Guyana became a republic, the Cacique&#x27;s Crown has been consistently used by all presidents. It is commonly seen on stationery, the presidential vehicle, at the president&#x27;s office, and the State House – the president&#x27;s official residence. While the Cacique&#x27;s Crown used by the president and on items connected to the president may have slight artistic variations, it always consists of a design containing seven feathers and is often coloured in solid gold or in different shades of gold to show relief. Use of the Cacique&#x27;s Crown in an unauthorized manner is restricted. The Cacique&#x27;s Crown is also the main feature of the crest of the coat of arms of Guyana.

===Arms of the president===
The arms of the president was adopted by proclamation on 23 February 1970 when Guyana became a republic. It consists of the shield from the coat of arms of Guyana containing a green inescutcheon bearing a Cacique&#x27;s Crown in full colour. The overall shield design is surmounted by a predominantly gold coloured Cacique&#x27;s Crown.

The arms of the president is rarely seen in use. Successive presidents have used the Cacique&#x27;s Crown more frequently and consistently than the arms of the president. During the David Granger presidency (2015-2020), the arms of the president was used more frequently when it formed the main charge of his presidential standard.

==Independence constitution==
Independent Guyana&#x27;s first constitution, a modified version of the 1961 constitution, took effect on the first day of independence, May 26, 1966. It reaffirmed the principle that Guyana was a democratic state founded on the rule of law. The titular head of the country was the British monarch, represented in Guyana by the governor general, who served in a largely ceremonial capacity. Real executive power rested in the prime minister, appointed by the majority party in the renamed National Assembly, and his ministers. The first post-independence elections in 1968 confirmed the dominant role of the PNC and its leader, Forbes Burnham. On February 23, 1970, the Burnham government proclaimed the Cooperative Republic of Guyana. This move had both economic and political ramifications. The government argued that the country&#x27;s many resources had been controlled by foreign capitalists and that organizing the population into cooperatives would provide the best path to development.

The 1970 proclamation severed Guyana&#x27;s last significant constitutional tie to Britain. The governor general, heretofore the ceremonial head of state, was replaced by a Guyanese, was the country&#x27;s first president.

Although its ties to the British monarch were broken, Guyana remained within the Commonwealth of Nations. Membership in the Commonwealth allowed Guyana to reap the benefits of access to markets in Britain and to retain some of the defence arrangements that Britain offered its former colonies. In particular, the British defence umbrella was seen as a deterrent to Venezuelan claims on Guyanese territory.

In 1978 a constitutional referendum was held. The proposed change to Article 73 of the constitution would abolish the need for referendums to change the entrenched provisions of the constitution (including presidential powers, the dissolution of Parliament and the electoral system) and instead allow them to be changed by a two-thirds majority in parliament (which the PNC had at the time). It would also result in the postponement of the elections scheduled for later in the year, and instead the parliament elected in 1973 would be declared a Constituent Assembly.

<text>The prime minister of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana is an elected member of the National Assembly of Guyana who is the principal assistant and advisor to the president as well as the leader of government business in the Assembly, but is not the head of government in Guyana. The prime minister assumes the office of president if the presidency becomes vacant.

==Background==
The office of Prime Minister of Guyana was established in 1966 upon Guyana becoming independent. The office is the direct successor to that of the Premier and Chief Minister of British Guiana. In 1964, the last elections in British Guiana were held. With the next elections slated to occur after independence, the Premier of British Guiana automatically became Prime Minister of Guyana on Independence Day.

From 1966 to 1980 the prime minister was the head of government, exercising executive power and general direction and control of the government. During this time the country’s head of state was Elizabeth II (represented by a governor-general) from 1966 to 1970, and then a ceremonial president from 1970 to 1980 after Guyana became a republic.

The 1980 constitution abolished the ceremonial presidency and created an executive president who became head of state and head of government. Under the constitution, the prime minister before the commencement of the constitution became the president with full executive powers. The office of Prime Minister was retained and now included the permanent subsidiary office of First Vice-President to further highlight the constitutional role of the prime minister as the president’s successor. However the powers and influence of the office and individual prime ministers have varied depending on the responsibilities delegated by the president.

==Appointment and responsibilities==
The prime minister is appointed by the president from among the elected members of the National Assembly of Guyana. As a result of the political structure of the government of Guyana where an election for the members of the National Assembly concurrently serves as an election of the president, the prime minister is always drawn from the party or coalition the president belongs to. Despite it being the practice of almost all political parties or coalitions to designate a presidential and prime ministerial candidate in the event they secure the most votes over any other parties or coalitions in the election, only a presidential candidate is legally required to be designated in advance of the election.

The selection, appointment, and removal of the prime minister is therefore constitutionally at the discretion of the president; however, only a member of the National Assembly who is eligible to become president may be appointed prime minister. This ensures that the requirements for a person to become president are met in case circumstances result in the prime minister having to accede to the office.

Under Article 101 of the Constitution of Guyana, the prime minister is described as the president’s principal assistant in the discharge of the functions of the president. The responsibilities of the prime minister include:
* Serving as Acting President whenever the President is temporarily absent or unable to discharge the functions of the office.
* Acceding to the Presidency in the event of the death, removal, or resignation of a President.
* Chairing the meetings of the Cabinet in the absence of the President.
* Serving as the Leader of Government Business in the National Assembly (this is a legislative role and not akin to being Head of Government). 
* Heading the office of the Prime Minister and having oversight of the subordinate agencies of that office.
* Serving as the subject Minister of any additional ministerial portfolios designated by the President.

The Constitution also mandates that the prime minister – being first vice-president – has precedence over any additional vice president(s).

==Oath of office==
Prior to the appointment of a Prime Minister, the President will issue an ‘Instrument Appointing a Prime Minister’ under the Seal of Guyana which sets out the name of the person to be appointed, and the section of the constitution utilized to make the appointment.

The Prime Minister-designate then takes the following oath of office of the form specified in the Schedule to the Constitution of Guyana:
The phrase &#x27;so help me God&#x27; is not specified in the constitution, but may be added at the end of the oath on the personal discretion of the prime minister. 
The oath is then signed by the prime minister and countersigned by the president, after which, the instrument of appointment is handed over to the prime minister.

==Symbols of office==
There are no distinctive symbols of the office of prime minister as the coat of arms of Guyana is used. The prime minister is one of only two officials in Guyana – the other being the president – who do not use regular vehicle plates. The vehicle containing the prime minister displays a gold image of the coat of arms of Guyana.

==List of prime ministers==
This is a list of the prime ministers of Guyana, from the establishment of the office of Chief Minister of British Guiana in 1953 to the present day. After the creation of the vice presidency in 1980, the title became the Prime Minister and First Vice President of Guyana.

<text>The president of the Republic of Suriname () is, in accordance with the Constitution of 1987, the head of state and head of government of Suriname, and commander-in-chief of the Suriname National Army (SNL). The president also appoints a cabinet.

The current president is Chan Santokhi, a former chief of police. He is affiliated with the Progressive Reform Party (VHP). Santokhi was elected on 13 July 2020 as president by acclamation in an uncontested election, and inaugurated on 16 July on the Onafhankelijkheidsplein in Paramaribo in a ceremony without the public presence due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
The office of president was created upon independence from the Netherlands in 1975. Until 1987, the presidency was mostly a ceremonial post, discharging most of the functions previously vested in the monarchy of the Netherlands. For all intents and purposes, real power was vested in the prime minister.

The first officeholder was Johan Ferrier, a schoolteacher and veteran politician who had served as governor since 1968. He resigned as president in August 1980, several months after a coup d&#x27;état. From then until 1988, the presidents were essentially army-installed puppets of army commander Dési Bouterse, who ruled as a &quot;de facto&quot; military dictator with few practical checks on his power. 

Bouterse allowed multiparty elections in 1987, shortly after the current constitution was approved in a referendum. The presidency became an executive post, with duties and responsibilities similar to those of presidents in semi-presidential republics. On 24 December 1990, two days after Bouterse&#x27;s resignation as army commander, the army called president Ramsewak Shankar to inform him that he and his cabinet were removed from office, in another coup d&#x27;état; police chief and acting army commander Ivan Graanoogst was appointed acting president. On 27 December 1990, Johannes Kraag became the president. The army returned power to civilians in 1991, and the president has been freely elected ever since.

==Election==
The president and a vice president are elected by no less than a two-thirds supermajority of members in the National Assembly to a five-year mandate and are accountable to the Assembly. During their time in office, the president must forfeit any additional posts in politics or business.

==Qualification==
A candidate must be a Surinamese national (resident in the country for at least six years) who is at least 30 years of age. A candidate must win at least two-thirds of the votes in the Assembly to be elected. If no candidate wins two-thirds after three rounds, the vote then goes to the United People&#x27;s Congress, composed of the Assembly and local government officials. In this case, a simple majority is required.

==Powers and duties==
The president is vested with extensive functional powers. The president names and dismisses ministers, signs bills, and names and dismisses diplomatic staff. He declares war and states of emergency with the ratification of the National Assembly. He concludes foreign treaties and agreements, again with the assent of the Assembly. He also exercises ceremonial duties such as conferring awards, receiving foreign diplomats, and granting pardons.

<doc id="489605" wikidata="Q5736703" url="?curid=489605" title="Here's Humphrey">
<text>Here&#x27;s Humphrey was an Australian children&#x27;s television series produced by Banksia Productions for the Nine Network, which first aired on 24 May 1965 and last went to air in 2008. 

It features an anthropomorphic brown bear character (a person in a costume) known as Humphrey B. Bear, and was produced in Adelaide, South Australia. In September 2013, community station, West TV, began airing repeats of &quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; in Perth. The character still exists, owned by Ozpix Entertainment as of 2020.

&quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; became one of the most successful programs for preschoolers in Australia, was sold internationally, and is one of the longest-running children&#x27;s television programs in the world. The program received multiple Logie Television Awards.

==Format==
The series features anthropomorphic brown bear character known as Humphrey B. Bear, who is mute. Set in a magical forest, Humphrey is paired with a human presenter, who narrates their adventures. The series takes place in Humphrey&#x27;s tree house, where he partakes in magical adventures.

One of the central ideas presented in the show is the importance of taking part and not always being successful at everything.

===Presenters===
===Humphrey B. Bear===
Several performers portrayed the role of Humphrey.
* Edwin Duryea (1965)
* Ross Hutchinson
* John Maclean
* Tom Fairlie
* Aaron Dubois (1992-1994)
* Tony Balzan (1985–2008)

==Production==
&quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; was originally aired exclusively in Adelaide on NWS-9, premiering on 24 May 1965, before airing nationally two years later. Filmed in Adelaide and produced by Banskia Productions, the character of Humphrey was initially known as &quot;Bear Bear&quot; until he was renamed as a result of a competition. The program was created as a result of Humphrey&#x27;s previous popularity on the afternoon program &quot;The Channel Niners&quot;.&quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; was granted a P classification, deeming it specifically designed to meet the needs and interests of pre-schoolers and allowing it to be broadcast on the Nine Network with a 30-minute runtime commercial-free. Classification deals allowed the Nine Network to repeat each episode three times.

The Nine Network almost cancelled the series in 2000, which led to protests and comments from the Prime Minister. The network responded to popular public demand and allowed its continuation. The series was commissioned for 180 new episodes in May 2000. New episodes aired until 2003.

In February 2007, Nine commissioned a new series of &quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot;, filming episodes for the first time since 2003. This followed negotiations with the network, after speculation they would not renew the series approaching the end of its contract. The episodes started airing in December 2007 and concluded in 2009 when Banksia Entertainment was wound up.

In September 2019, it was revealed OZPIX were planning to revive &quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; with a pitch to broadcasters at MIPCOM in France. The production company expressed interest in integrating live action characters with virtual technology. The production team for the project was led by Julie Greene, former executive producer of &quot;Hi-5&quot;, and included Catherine Martin and Helen Martin, early childhood specialists who also worked on the program. 

 Ozpix Entertainment owns the character, whose &quot;home&quot; is at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast, Queensland.

==Episodes==
More than 3,000 episodes of &quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; have been produced. It has also been stated that only 1,776 episodes were filmed.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Reception==
In 2019, &quot;TV Week&quot; listed &quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; at #96 in its list of the 101 greatest Australian television shows of all time, which appeared in its monthly &quot;TV Week Close Up&quot; publication. The magazine said young viewers loved watching Humphrey leave his tree house for adventures in the magic forest.

It has been stated that &quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot; is one of the most successful programs for preschoolers of all time. It is one of the longest running children&#x27;s programs in the world.

==Awards and nominations==
The program received multiple Logie Television Awards, and the character won a special &quot;Citizen of the Year&quot; Award at the 1994 Australia Day celebrations.

<doc id="489608" wikidata="Q622712" url="?curid=489608" title="Vietnamese alphabet">
<text>The Vietnamese alphabet (, ) is the modern writing script for the Vietnamese language. It uses the Latin script based on Romance languages originally developed by Francisco de Pina (1585–1625), a missionary from Portugal.

The Vietnamese alphabet contains 29 letters, including 7 letters using four diacritics: , , , , , , and . There are an additional 5 diacritics used to designate tone (as in , , , , and ). The complex vowel system and the large number of letters with diacritics, which can stack twice on the same letter (e.g. meaning &#x27;first&#x27;), makes it easy to distinguish the Vietnamese orthography from other writing systems that use the Latin script.

The Vietnamese system&#x27;s use of diacritics produces an accurate transcription for tones despite the limitations of the Roman alphabet. On the other hand, sound changes in the spoken language have led to different letters, digraphs and trigraphs now representing the same sounds.

==Letter names and pronunciation==
Vietnamese uses 22 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. The 4 remaining letters aren&#x27;t considered part of the Vietnamese alphabet although they are used to write loanwords, languages of other ethnic groups in the country based on Vietnamese phonetics to differentiate the meanings or even Vietnamese dialects, for example: or for southerner pronunciation of in standard Vietnamese.

In total, there are 12 vowels () and 17 consonants (, literally &#x27;extra sound&#x27;).


;Notes:
* The vowels in the table are bolded and italicized.
* The use of the terms or to refer to and as or to refer to is to avoid confusion in some contexts, the same for as or (literally, &#x27;strong s&#x27; or &#x27;heavy s&#x27;) and as (literally, &#x27;light x&#x27;), as (literally, &#x27;short i&#x27;) and as (literally, &#x27;long y&#x27;).
* is always followed by in every word and phrase in Vietnamese, e.g. &#x27;trousers&#x27;, &#x27;to attract&#x27;, etc.
* The name for is from the French name for the letter: (literally, &#x27;Greek i&#x27;), referring to the letter&#x27;s origin from the Greek letter &quot;upsilon&quot;. The other obsolete French pronunciations include () and ().
* The Vietnamese alphabet lacks the 4 letters (, ), (), ( &#x27;double u&#x27;, , &#x27;double v&#x27;) and (). However, these letters are often used for foreign loanwords (even partially adapted ones: &#x27;fluorine&#x27;, &#x27;joule&#x27;, &#x27;base&#x27;) or may be kept for foreign names.
* is most commonly treated as a vowel along with . represents &#x27;short &#x27; and represents &#x27;long &#x27;. can have tones as well as other vowels (, , , , ) e.g. &#x27;America&#x27;. It may also act as a consonant (when used after and ). It can sometimes be used to replace , e.g. &#x27;bread&#x27; can sometimes be written by some people, but it is not generally considered standard or accurate.
* and are similar to each other in sound in Northern Vietnamese dialects or with some Southern Vietnamese speakers (especially in the Mekong Delta region) and can sometimes be used interchangeably between these speakers, e.g. or &#x27;grass jelly&#x27;.

=== Middle Vietnamese alphabet ===
The Vietnamese alphabet in the &quot;Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum&quot; of Alexandre de Rhodes has 23 letters:

In this dictionary, there are fewer letters than the modern alphabet. The letters &quot;ă&quot;, &quot;â&quot;, &quot;ê&quot;, &quot;ô&quot;, &quot;ơ&quot;, and &quot;ư&quot; are regarded as separate letters in the modern alphabet and are used in the dictionary, but the author does not regard them as separate letters. In the dictionary, a letter with diacritics, like &quot;à&quot;, &quot;ạ&quot;, &quot;ă&quot;, &quot;ằ&quot;, and &quot;ặ&quot;, are not separate from the letter ; &quot;à&quot;, &quot;ạ&quot;, &quot;ă&quot;, &quot;ằ&quot;, and &quot;ặ&quot; are just regarded as the letter with diacritics.

In the alphabet, there is a letter, the letter b with flourish &quot;ꞗ&quot;, that has fallen out of use. It was used to represents the voiced bilabial fricative /β/.

Two letters, &quot;ꞗ&quot; and &quot;đ&quot;, are neither upper nor lower case. So according to that orthography, the names of the two provinces Đồng Nai and Lâm Đồng will be &quot;đồng Nai&quot; and &quot;Lâm đồng&quot;. In the modern alphabet, the lower case version of &quot;đ&quot; is &quot;đ&quot;, and upper case version of &quot;đ&quot; is &quot;Đ&quot;.

There are two variants of minuscule &quot;s&quot;: the long s, &quot;ſ&quot;, and the short s, &quot;s&quot;. In the modern alphabet, the long s, &quot;ſ&quot;, is no longer used, and the short s, &quot;s&quot;, is the only variant of s.

Normal &quot;v&quot; in the dictionary has two variants: the normal v, &quot;v&quot;, and the curving-bottom v, &quot;u&quot;. In the 17th century, &quot;v&quot; and &quot;u&quot; were not different letters, &quot;v&quot; being a variant of &quot;u&quot;.

==Consonants==
The alphabet is largely derived from Portuguese with some influence from French, although the usage of and was borrowed from Italian (compare , ) and that for from (Latinised) Greek and Latin (compare , , ), mirroring the English usage of these letters (compare , , ).

There is one trigraph, , and ten digraphs: , , , , , , , , , .
* The consonants also called with its phoneme with , except . So will be , will be and so on.
==Vowels==

===Pronunciation===

The correspondence between the orthography and pronunciation is somewhat complicated. In some cases, the same letter may represent several different sounds, and different letters may represent the same sound. This is because the orthography was designed centuries ago and the spoken language has changed, as shown in the chart directly above that contrasts the difference between Middle and Modern Vietnamese.

 and are mostly equivalent, and there is no concrete rule that says when to use one or the other, except in sequences like and (i.e. &#x27;arm, hand&#x27; is read as while &#x27;ear&#x27; is read as ). There have been attempts since the late 20th century to standardize the orthography by replacing with when it represents a vowel, the latest being a decision from the Vietnamese Ministry of Education in 1984. These efforts seem to have had limited effect. In textbooks published by Nhà Xuất bản Giáo dục (&#x27;Publishing House of Education&#x27;), is used to represent only in Sino-Vietnamese words that are written with one letter alone (diacritics can still be added, as in , ), at the beginning of a syllable when followed by (as in , ), after and in the sequence ; therefore such forms as * and * are not &quot;standard&quot;, though they are much preferred elsewhere. Most people and the popular media continue to use the spelling that they are most accustomed to.


The uses of and to represent the phoneme can be categorized as &quot;standard&quot; (as used in textbooks published by Nhà Xuất bản Giáo dục) and &quot;non-standard&quot; as follows.

This &quot;standard&quot; set by Nhà Xuất bản Giáo dục is not definite. It is unknown why the literature books use &quot;Lí&quot; while the history books use &quot;Lý&quot;.

===Spelling===

====Vowel nuclei====

The table below matches the vowels of Hanoi Vietnamese (written in the IPA) and their respective orthographic symbols used in the writing system.

Notes:
*The vowel is:
**usually written : = (a suffix indicating profession, similar to the English suffix &quot;-er&quot;).
**sometimes written after , , , , , , , , : = &#x27;America&#x27;
***It is always written when:
::# preceded by an orthographic vowel: = &#x27;to advise&#x27;;
::# at the beginning of a word derived from Chinese (written as otherwise): = &#x27;to love&#x27;.
*The vowel is written before or (since in that position represents ): = &#x27;organ (musical)&#x27;; = . This generally only occurs in recent loanwords or when representing dialectal pronunciation.
*Similarly, the vowel is written before or : = (Nghệ An/Hà Tĩnh variant of ). But unlike being frequently used in onomatopoeia, transcriptions from other languages and words &quot;borrowed&quot; from Nghệ An/Hà Tĩnh dialects (such as ), seems to be used solely to convey the feel of the Nghệ An/Hà Tĩnh accents. In transcriptions, is preferred (e.g. &#x27;cardboard&#x27;, &#x27;accordion&#x27;).

====Diphthongs and triphthongs====

Notes:

The glide is written:
* after (spelled in this instance)
* in front of , , or except after 
* following and 
* in all other cases; is written as instead of * (cf. ), and that is written as after 

The off-glide is written as except after and , where it is written as ; is written as instead of * (cf. ).

The diphthong is written:
* at the end of a syllable: = &#x27;sugar cane&#x27;
* before a consonant or off-glide: = &#x27;piece&#x27;; = &#x27;to slope, slant&#x27;
:The of the diphthong changes to after :
:*: = &#x27;late at night&#x27;
:*: = &#x27;to advise&#x27;
: changes to at the beginning of a syllable ( does not change):
:* = &#x27;calm&#x27;; &#x27;weak, feeble&#x27;

The diphthong is written:
* at the end of a syllable: = &#x27;to buy&#x27;
* before a consonant or off-glide: = &#x27;ten thousand&#x27;; = &#x27;down&#x27;

The diphthong is written:
* at the end of a syllable: = &#x27;to rain&#x27;
* before a consonant or off-glide: = &#x27;irrigation canal&#x27;; = &#x27;to water, irrigate, sprinkle&#x27;

==Tone marks==
Vietnamese is a tonal language, so the meaning of each word depends on the pitch in which it is pronounced. Tones are marked in the IPA as suprasegmentals following the phonemic value. Some tones are also associated with a glottalization pattern.

There are six distinct tones in the standard northern dialect. The first one (&quot;level tone&quot;) is not marked and the other five are indicated by diacritics applied to the vowel part of the syllable. The tone names are chosen such that the name of each tone is spoken in the tone it identifies.

In the south, there is a merging of the and tones, in effect leaving five tones.

* &quot;*&quot;: codice_1 (in TELEX) and codice_2 (in VNI) keys are used to remove the mark. For example, in VNI, codice_3 → , then press codice_2 → .
* Unmarked vowels are pronounced with a level voice, in the middle of the speaking range.
* The grave accent indicates that the speaker should start somewhat low and drop slightly in tone, with the voice becoming increasingly breathy.
* The hook indicates in Northern Vietnamese that the speaker should start in the middle range and fall, but in Southern Vietnamese that the speaker should start somewhat low and fall, then rise (as when asking a question in English).
* In the North, a perispomeni indicates that the speaker should start mid, break off (with a glottal stop), then start again and rise like a question in tone. In the South, it is realized identically to the Hỏi tone.
*The acute accent indicates that the speaker should start mid and rise sharply in tone.
*The dot or cross signifies in Northern Vietnamese that the speaker starts low and fall lower in tone, with the voice becoming increasingly creaky and ending in a glottal stop.

In syllables where the vowel part consists of more than one vowel (such as diphthongs and triphthongs), the placement of the tone is still a matter of debate. Generally, there are two methodologies, an &quot;old style&quot; and a &quot;new style&quot;. While the &quot;old style&quot; emphasizes aesthetics by placing the tone mark as close as possible to the center of the word (by placing the tone mark on the last vowel if an ending consonant part exists and on the next-to-last vowel if the ending consonant does not exist, as in , ), the &quot;new style&quot; emphasizes linguistic principles and tries to apply the tone mark on the main vowel (as in , ). In both styles, when one vowel already has a quality diacritic on it, the tone mark must be applied to it as well, regardless of where it appears in the syllable (thus is acceptable while is not). In the case of the diphthong, the mark is placed on the . The in is considered part of the consonant. Currently, the new style is usually used in textbooks published by , while most people still prefer the old style in casual uses. Among Overseas Vietnamese communities, the old style is predominant for all purposes.

In lexical ordering, differences in letters are treated as primary, differences in tone markings as secondary and differences in case as tertiary differences. (Letters include for instance and but not . Older dictionaries also treated digraphs and trigraphs like and as base letters.) Ordering according to primary and secondary differences proceeds syllable by syllable. According to this principle, a dictionary lists before because the secondary difference in the first syllable takes precedence over the primary difference in the second syllable.

==Structure==
In the past, syllables in multisyllabic words were concatenated with hyphens, but this practice has died out and hyphenation is now reserved for word-borrowings from other languages. A written syllable consists of at most three parts, in the following order from left to right:
#An optional beginning consonant part
#A required vowel syllable nucleus and the tone mark, if needed, applied above or below it
#An ending consonant part, can only be one of the following: , , , , , , , , or nothing.

==History==
Since the beginning of the Chinese rule 111 BC, literature, government papers, scholarly works, and religious scripture were all written in classical Chinese (漢文 &quot;Hán văn&quot;) while indigenous writing with started around the ninth century. Since the 12th century, several Vietnamese words started to be written in &quot;&quot;, using Chinese characters. The system was based on Chinese characters, but was also supplemented with Vietnamese-invented characters to represent native Vietnamese words. These characters adapted or created using methods such as creating phono-semantic compounds (形聲 hình thanh), double-phonetic compounds (會音 hội âm), and borrowing the character for its pronunciation (假借 giả tá).

=== Name ===
People have called the Latinized script of Vietnamese &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot; at least since 1867. In 1867, scholar Trương Vĩnh Ký published two grammar books. The first book is &quot;Mẹo luật dạy học tiếng pha-lang-sa&quot; (Tips to teach and learn French)&quot;,&quot; a Vietnamese book written in chữ Quốc ngữ about French grammar. In this book, the Latinized script of Vietnamese was called &quot;chữ quốc ngự&quot; (not &quot;ngữ&quot;). The second book is &quot;Abrégé de grammaire annamite&quot; (Simplification of Annamite grammar), a French book about Vietnamese grammar. In this book, the Latinized script of Vietnamese was called &quot;l&quot;’alphabet européen&quot;&quot; (European alphabet)&quot;, les caractères latins&quot; (Latin characters). On Gia Dinh Bao April 15th issue of 1867, when mentioned the French book about Vietnamese grammar, the name &quot;chữ quốc ngữ&quot; was used to indicate the Latinized script of Vietnamese.

=== Creation of ===
As early as 1620, with the work of Francisco de Pina, Portuguese and Italian Jesuit missionaries in Vietnam began using Latin script to transcribe the Vietnamese language as an assistance for learning the language. The work was continued by the Avignonese Alexandre de Rhodes. Building on previous dictionaries by Gaspar do Amaral and António Barbosa, Rhodes compiled the &quot;Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum&quot;, a Vietnamese–Portuguese–Latin dictionary, which was later printed in Rome in 1651, using their spelling system. These efforts led eventually to the development of the present Vietnamese alphabet. For 200 years, was used within the Catholic community. However, works written in the Vietnamese alphabet were in the minority and Catholic works in chữ Nôm were significantly more widespread. Chữ Nôm was the primary writing system used by Vietnamese Catholics.

=== Colonial period ===
In 1910, the French colonial administration enforced . The Latin alphabet then became a means to publish Vietnamese popular literature, which was disparaged as vulgar by the Chinese-educated imperial elites. Historian Pamela A. Pears asserted that by instituting the Latin alphabet in Vietnam, the French cut the Vietnamese from their traditional Hán Nôm literature. An important reason why Latin script became the standard writing system in Vietnam but not in Cambodia and Laos, which were both dominated by the French for a similar amount of time under the same colonial framework, had to do with the Nguyễn Emperors of Vietnam heavily promoting its usage. According to the historian Liam Kelley in his 2016 work &quot;Emperor Thành Thái’s Educational Revolution&quot; neither the French nor the revolutionaries had enough power to spread the usage of down to the village level. It was by imperial decree in 1906 of Emperor Thành Thái, that parents could decide whether their children will follow a curriculum in () or (, &#x27;Southern sound&#x27;, the contemporary Vietnamese name for &#x27;). This decree was issued at the same time when other social changes, such as the cutting of long male hair, were occurring. The main reason for the popularisation of the Latin alphabet in Vietnam/Đại Nam during the Nguyễn dynasty (the French protectorates of Annam and Tonkin) was because of the pioneering efforts by intellectuals from French Cochinchina combined with the progressive and scientific policies of the French government in French Indochina, that created the momentum for the usage of &#x27; to spread.

Since the 1920s, the Vietnamese mostly use &#x27;, and new Vietnamese terms for new items or words are often calqued from Hán Nôm. Some French had originally planned to replace Vietnamese with French, but this never was a serious project, given the small number of French settlers compared with the native population. The French had to reluctantly accept the use of &#x27; to write Vietnamese since this writing system, created by Portuguese missionaries, is based on Portuguese orthography, not French.

==== Mass education ====
Between 1907 and 1908, the short-lived Tonkin Free School promulgated &quot;&quot; and taught French language to the general population.

In 1917, the French system suppressed Vietnam&#x27;s Confucian examination system, viewed as an aristocratic system linked with the &quot;ancient regime&quot;, thereby forcing Vietnamese elites to educate their offspring in the French language education system. Emperor Khải Định declared the traditional writing system abolished in 1918.
While traditional nationalists favoured the Confucian examination system and the use of chữ Hán, Vietnamese revolutionaries, progressive nationalists, and pro-French elites viewed the French education system as a means to &quot;liberate&quot; the Vietnamese from old Chinese domination and the unsatisfactory &quot;outdated&quot; Confucian examination system, to democratize education and to help bridge Vietnamese to European philosophies.

The French colonial system then set up another educational system, teaching Vietnamese as a first language using &#x27; in primary school and then the French language (taught in &#x27;). Hundreds of thousands of textbooks for primary education began to be published in &quot;&quot;, with the unintentional result of turning the script into the popular medium for the expression for Vietnamese culture.

=== Late 20th century to present ===
Typesetting and printing Vietnamese has been challenging due to its number of accents/diacritics. This had led to the use of accent and diacritic-less names in Overseas Vietnamese, such as &quot;Viet&quot; instead of the proper &quot;Việt&quot;. Contemporary Vietnamese texts sometimes include words which have not been adapted to modern Vietnamese orthography, especially for documents written in chữ Hán. The Vietnamese language itself has been likened to a system akin to ruby characters elsewhere in Asia. French, which left a mark on the Vietnamese language in the form of loanwords and other influences, is no longer as widespread in Vietnam, with English or International English the preferred European language for commerce.

====Computing====
The universal character set Unicode has full support for the Latin Vietnamese writing system, although it does not have a separate segment for it. The required characters that other languages use are scattered throughout the Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A and Latin Extended-B blocks; those that remain (such as the letters with &quot;dau hoi&quot;) are placed in the Latin Extended Additional block. An ASCII-based writing convention, Vietnamese Quoted Readable and several byte-based encodings including VSCII (TCVN), VNI, VISCII and Windows-1258 were widely used before Unicode became popular. Most new documents now exclusively use the Unicode format UTF-8.

Unicode allows the user to choose between precomposed characters and combining characters in inputting Vietnamese. Because in the past some fonts implemented combining characters in a nonstandard way (see Verdana font), most people use precomposed characters when composing Vietnamese-language documents (except on Windows where Windows-1258 used combining characters).

Most keyboards on modern phone and computer operating systems, including iOS, Android and MacOS, have now supported the Vietnamese language and direct input of diacritics by default. Previously, Vietnamese users had to manually install free software such as Unikey on computers or Laban Key on phones to type Vietnamese diacritics. These keyboards support input methods such as Telex.

<doc id="489616" wikidata="Q7085297" url="?curid=489616" title="Old Pasadena">
<text>Old Pasadena, often referred to as Old Town Pasadena or simply Old Town, is the original commercial center of Pasadena, a city in California, United States, and had a latter-day revitalization after a period of decay.

Old Pasadena began as the center of a research hub where science and research institutions such as Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and companies such as Beckman Instruments and Aerojet, were founded. The large concentration of such companies in the area gave it the nickname &quot;Athens of the West&quot;.
The area was also an artistic center, the home to Andy Warhol&#x27;s West Coast museum debut and the first Marcel Duchamp retrospective, both at the Pasadena Art Museum (one of the earliest modern art museums in the country, now the Norton Simon Museum). Before that, Pasadena was a center of suffragist and pacifist movements and other liberal causes. By the late 1940s, the downtown area was blighted by flophouses, dive bars and pawn shops. It later became a hippie destination, with head shops, adult bookstores and massage parlors. By the late 1980s, Old Pasadena was undergoing a period of urban renewal and regeneration.

== History ==

=== Fair Oaks and Colorado Boulevard ===

Old Pasadena&#x27;s center is the postal zero/zero intersection for the city of Pasadena at Fair Oaks Avenue (N-S) and Colorado Boulevard (E-W). The first of the businesses of the original Indiana Colony were established at old Pasadena. J. D. Hollingsworth&#x27;s general store served as the main supplier for the town as well as the post office when mail arrived from Los Angeles.

On the northwest corner was the Grand Hotel, in a building originally owned by Barney Williams, where the Williams family had run a general store on the ground floor. On the southwest corner (1 Fair Oaks Avenue) stood Williams Hall, also owned by the Williams family; this building was re-modeled in 1902 and became known as the Dodsworth Building, and now houses the Dodsworth Hotel.

The first meeting of Masons in Pasadena, later to become Pasadena Masonic Lodge No. 272, took place on 20 February 1883. A meeting in the library hall followed in October, at which the newly elected officials decided to make Williams Hall their permanent meeting place. An ornate front, similar to the facade of the present lodge, was erected on the upper story of the Colorado Boulevard building by H. Ridgway, an architect who was Master of the lodge in 1886. The Lodge continued to grow, and by 1917 it encompassed three separate lodges and fourteen affiliated bodies.

From the 1940s until the early 1970s, the Dodsworth Building, still displaying the masonic compass symbol on the inscribed stone in front of the building on its lower sides, contained a five-story furniture store belonging to Harry Steinberg and his son Albert Philip Steinberg, a 32nd degree mason and Shriner; that cornerstone now sits at the southwest corner of the Pasadena Masonic Temple at 200 S. Euclid Avenue.

=== Schoolhouse Block ===

In its infancy, the Indiana Colony was a quiet farming community centered around Orange Grove Boulevard, about a half mile west of Fair Oaks Avenue. Fair Oaks Avenue, just south of Colorado Boulevard, became the site of a new school, the Fair Oaks schoolhouse, a gift from Benjamin &quot;Don Benito&quot; Wilson. Fearing for the safety of children, the council of city fathers sought to move the schoolhouse away from the developing center of the town and its bustling activity, but Benjamin Wilson had died and his estate had passed to family members still living in the area. The council sought permission from the family on the understanding that the school would be moved immediately for the benefit of the children, but an improved school would be established somewhere outside Old Pasadena soon thereafter. The block of Fair Oaks Avenue, Colorado Boulevard, Raymond Avenue, and Green Street retained the name &quot;schoolhouse block.&quot;

No record of the subsequent location of the school was retained in the records, but the location of the new school can be drawn from several historical accounts. Hiram Reid&#x27;s &quot;History of Pasadena&quot; (1895) states that the schoolhouse was &quot;moved several feet east to a frontage on Raymond 500 feet north of a line parallel to the north wall of the Post Office building.&quot; In 1895 the Post Office was in the Morgan Block just north of Kansas Street (Green Street). Reid goes on to say that &quot;a beautiful new edifice stands there now,&quot; a reference to the Van der Vort building, built in 1894, replacing the schoolhouse. Eventually that building was sold to someone who moved it away for a residence, and a new Wilson School was later built outside of Old Pasadena, 4.2 miles to the east on Del Mar Boulevard and Madre Street.

Downtown Pasadena is currently served by Roosevelt, San Rafael, and McKinley Elementary Schools; Blair, and McKinley Middle Schools;, and Blair International Baccalaureate School. Maranatha High School is a Christian school in the area.

=== Castle Green ===
As Pasadena&#x27;s population grew in the late 19th and early 20th century, grand hotels were built which established Pasadena&#x27;s national reputation as a winter tourist destination for the wealthy. In 1887 Edward C. Webster began construction of a hotel at 1929 Green Street, on the southeast corner of Raymond Avenue and Kansas Street. When he was unable to complete the job, a newcomer to the area, Colonel George Gill Green, took over the construction and finished the Green Hotel, which opened in 1888.

Green was a friend of Andrew McNally, a prominent printer from Chicago who had moved West and made his home in Altadena. McNally had invited Green to come out and join him in this new community. Together Green and McNally invested heavily in the short-lived Altadena Railroad, which provided them private sidings at their residences and which Green rode daily to the construction site of his new hotel. Green and Andrew McNally were next door neighbors on Mariposa Street just west of Lake Avenue. The McNally home still stands and the old Green carriage house remains in use as a residence, and is visible from the rear parking lot of the Altadena Library, which stands on the site of the Green house.

The new Green Hotel was a 6-story edifice that faced Central Park on South Raymond, just north of the original Victorian Pasadena Train Station, where trains stopped between Chicago and Los Angeles. That station was replaced by the current station, in the Southwestern style.

In 1898, Green built a grander Mediterranean style hotel on the opposite side of Raymond. The first became referred to as the annex, and the second became the winter home for some of the most prominent industrial magnates in the Eastern United States. The two buildings were connected by a bridge across Raymond, and a tunnel under it. Guests arriving by train would pass through the annex, to the second floor, and be trammed across the bridge. In the main residence they would retire to their suites, and the luggage would follow via the tunnel. Many of the servants and attendants of the guests were forced to find accommodation in the adjacent buildings. In 1902 a new wing of the hotel was built along Kansas (now Green) Street to the P.G. Wooster Block, home of Throop University (forerunner to Caltech).

In 1924 the hotel was converted into residential apartments. The original building (annex) was razed to its first floor. All that is left of that original hotel is a portico on the corner of Raymond and Green. The building is now owned by Stats Floral Supply. In 1970, the U.S. government&#x27;s Department of Housing and Urban Development acquired the 1902 wing and separated the buildings into the Green Hotel on Green and the Castle Green on Raymond.

=== Other developments ===
In 1887, a Chicago land speculator named Morgan built a three-story block next to the site of the County Jail. In 1895, John Woodbury built a modest office building for himself which he shared with Jared S. Torrance. This building was replaced by the Marsh Block in 1902, which took up the whole corner lot of Raymond and Kansas south of the Morgan. In 1894 Van der Vort constructed the building that still bears his name at 32 S. Raymond. In 1889, Robert MacComber built the MacComber block on the northwest corner of Raymond and Kansas. In 1906 Braley built a bike manufacturing building, which eventually became an Oldsmobile dealership.

In 1887, a three-story Victorian red-brick building with bay windows and a turret on the southeast corner was constructed at 107 South Fair Oaks on the northwest corner at Dayton Street. It was named the &quot;Doty Block&quot; and housed a stagecoach showroom. In later years, it became The Mikado Hotel, which served the Japanese-American community. It became a freight depot for the Pasadena and Los Angeles Railroad, which later became part of the Pacific Electric Railway. Above the second floor windows on the south wall, the faint lettering &quot;Pasadena and Los Angeles&quot; that advertised that service can be seen today.

During the 1900s to the 1940s, Downtown Pasadena went through rapid change as the city&#x27;s population was continuously growing. Despite The Depression that occurred in the 1930s, Downtown Pasadena continued developing. Its hotels were converted into industrial, manufacturing and research offices. The transition of Downtown Pasadena from a tourist destination to an industrial site allowed for the area to continue its expansion and growth.

In the 1940s, the building became Pasadena&#x27;s first black-owned hotel, the Hotel Carver, when it was purchased and operated by Percy Clark and his sons Percy Jr., Robert and Littleton. In the basement was a prominent jazz club known first as the Onyx Club and later as the Cobra Club. In 1970, the hotel was sold and the building was converted into artist and performance studios. Over the next fifteen years, hundreds of artists, musicians, writers, dancers and filmmakers rented space at the Hotel Carver. The building was best known during this period for the John Bull English Pub, operated by Danny and Denise Sharp, and for the quirky word mural by Paul Waszink on the north wall reading: &quot;&quot;My people are the people of the dessert,&quot; said T.E. Lawrence, picking up his fork.&quot; Several art shows were held in the third-floor ballroom and other parts of the building. In 1985, the artists were evicted and the building closed. The 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake caused the collapse of the building immediately to the north of the Carver, and caused a large section of bricks on the top of the north wall to fall to the ground, destroying part of Waszink&#x27;s T.E. Lawrence mural. Following the earthquake, the north wall was re-bricked and the building remodeled and earthquake retrofitted, as part of the general redevelopment of Old Pasadena.

Robertson Motors built an auto factory just south of the Green Hotel Annex, which is now occupied by Fishbeck Furnishings.

In 1911, City Hall occupied a building at Union Street and Fair Oaks Avenue. Since then, City Hall has moved several times, and the building was lost, only to be replaced in 2003 by a quasi replica now known as the Container Store. The California National Guard used several buildings in Old Pasadena before they built The Armory on Raymond above Holly. The old brick building on Holly across from the senior center was a National Guard motor depot.

In 1929, Colorado Street (now Colorado Boulevard) was widened on the north side, and many of the elaborate Victorian facades of the buildings were lost to reconstruction and replaced with cheaper and more modern frontages. Colorado Street became 14 feet wider as a result. In 1929, Kansas Street was widened and renamed Green Street. Union and Holly streets were part of a city gateway that were to lead toward City Hall (1933) from the statue and flag at Orange Grove Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard. The whole plan was scaled down, but the streets were put in.

===Historic District===

As Downtown Pasadena was going through a time of decline during the 1970s, the city had established a Central District Improvement Plan which to improve the conditions of the area. The plan involved the demolition of old historical buildings in order to make way for more modern buildings. However, there was a preservationist group called Pasadena Heritage that fought to save and redevelop the existing historic structures. Pasadena Heritage was founded in 1977 to save Civic Center buildings that were facing demolition.

The Historic Old Pasadena District was designated in 1980 as a historic district of the Pasadena Charter, defined by its boundaries: to the North, Holly Street from Fair Oaks Avenue to Arroyo Parkway; to the East, Arroyo Parkway south to Green Street, moving half a block west to the old Santa Fe RR right-of-way; continuing south to encompass the Old Train Station and Central Park, then north on Fair Oaks Avenue to De Lacey Street, then west to Pasadena Avenue; on the West by Pasadena Avenue, north to Union Street, back to Fair Oaks Avenue, and north to Holly Street.

It was chartered as a means of revitalizing the oldest part of Pasadena, which, though not abandoned, had fallen derelict and was economically and commercially barren. With this charter, a controlled redevelopment was established, with federal tax incentives to qualifying investors. Under strict guidelines, buildings were stripped of old paint, revealing some of the early brickwork fasciae. All renovations and remodeling were overseen by a city commission, which approved materials, colors and styles, most of which were to reflect the period from 1925 to 1940.

The Old Pasadena Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

== Old Pasadena today ==
As business started to move out of Downtown Pasadena in the 1950s, the area started to go through a period of decline. This area began to be known as Skid Row as buildings were left abandoned. Pasadena&#x27;s downtown declined between 1930 and 1980, but has since been revived as “Old Pasadena”, one of Southern California&#x27;s most popular shopping and entertainment destinations.

Redevelopment of the downtown area started as there was an infusion of about more than $400 million in public and private money. With the infusion in money, it allowed for private property developments, street improvements, and construction of new buildings such as more parking garages and a retail shopping center. However, not all of this money was focused on new buildings as existing structures were rehabilitated. The existing buildings were redeveloped in order to recreate old Downtown Pasadena. As the redevelopment plans were completed, Downtown Pasadena went through a period of continuous growth. According to Shigley, Pasadena became a model of smart growth for California. This was because of the mixed-use buildings with housing units, retail shops, and professional services which allowed for the growth of Downtown Pasadena commercially and residentially.

Old Pasadena today is mostly a business district, with some mixed use. It contains a shopping mall, up-market restaurants, a movie theater, nightclubs, shops, outdoor cafés, pubs and comedy clubs, and has an active nightlife. The Pasadena Playhouse is located in Old Pasadena. Most of the buildings also have offices and apartments on the upper floors.

Old Pasadena is connected to Downtown Los Angeles via the Metro A Line light rail. Del Mar station is two blocks south of Colorado Boulevard, while Memorial Park station enters from Holly Street and Arroyo Parkway. The Norton Simon Museum is located at Orange Grove Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard. Pacific Oaks College Eureka campus is located at Fair Oaks Avenue and Eureka Street, the very north end of Old Pasadena. On New Year&#x27;s Day, the Tournament of Roses Parade travels through Old Pasadena on Colorado Boulevard. The spectacle draws an average of 1.5 million spectators each year, thousands of whom camp overnight on the route to have a prime view of the parade.

ArtPerformance is an annual outdoor music event featuring free concerts on multiple stages throughout Old Pasadena, in conjunction with PasadenART Weekend, a three-day citywide event.

Three street intersections in Old Pasadena, Colorado/DeLacey, Colorado/Fair Oaks and Colorado/Raymond, use the pedestrian scramble system, as used in Tokyo, Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.

<doc id="489618" wikidata="Q390816" url="?curid=489618" title="Grumman F9F Panther">
<text>The Grumman F9F Panther is an early carrier-based jet fighter designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Grumman. It was the first jet-powered fighter aircraft to see air-to-air combat with the United States Navy as well as being Grumman’s first jet fighter.

Development of the Panther commenced in the final months of World War II to harness the recent innovation of the jet engine. Grumman designed a single-engined, straight-winged day fighter that was armed with four cannons and could also carry a wide assortment of air-to-ground munitions. Production aircraft were typically powered by a single Allison J33 or Pratt &amp; Whitney J48-P-2 turbojet engine. On 21 November 1947, the prototype performed its maiden flight, powered by an imported Rolls-Royce Nene engine. During September 1949, the F9F was cleared for flight from aircraft carriers.

The Panther was used extensively by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in the Korean War. On 3 July 1950, a F9F-3 recorded the first U.S. Navy air victory of the conflict, having shot down a propeller-powered Yak-9. In the Korean theatre, Panther pilots cumulatively claimed the shooting down of seven Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s. During 1956, the type was withdrawn from front-line combat service, but remained in secondary roles, such as for training and with U.S. Naval Air Reserve and U.S. Marine Air Reserve units, until 1958. The Panther was also the first jet aircraft used by the Blue Angels aerobatics demonstration team, being flown in this capacity from 1949 through to late 1954. Future astronauts Neil Armstrong and John Glenn both flew the F9F extensively during the Korean War.

While Australia was interested in the Panther during the late 1940s, the nation ultimately opted for the Gloster Meteor F.8 and the CAC Sabre instead. The aircraft&#x27;s only export customer was Argentina, where it became the first jet aircraft to be operated by the Argentine Naval Aviation. It was operated mainly from land, as the catapults of the aircraft carrier ARA &quot;Independencia&quot; lacked sufficient power to readily launch the F9F. Several Panthers participated in the 1963 Argentine Navy Revolt, firing upon Argentine Army forces sent to quell the revolt. During 1969, it was withdrawn from Argentine service due to a lack of spare parts. 

Grumman would develop the F9F design in response to U.S. Navy interest, producing the swept wing Grumman F-9 Cougar.

==Design and development==
===Background===

The origins of the Panther can be traced back to development studies performed by Grumman into jet-powered fighter aircraft near the end of World War II. The company was keen to capitalise on the emergence of the first practical jet engines by integrating them into a new aircraft design. This design, which was internally designated &quot;G-75&quot;, was submitted to a United States Navy competition that sought a jet-powered night fighter to equip its aircraft carriers with. However, on 3 April 1946, it was announced that the Douglas F3D Skyknight, a competing two-seat aircraft powered by four Westinghouse J30 turbojets, had been selected. On 11 April 1946, the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) issued a development contract to Grumman to produce a pair of G-75 prototypes, which were given the Navy designation &quot;XF9F-1&quot;, in case development of the Skyknight encountered severe problems.

Shortly thereafter, Grumman recognised that the G-75 did not have much potential for either performance or growth; the company had already undertaken work on a completely different single-engine day fighter, the &quot;G-79&quot;. In a bureaucratic maneuver, BuAer opted not to cancel the G-75 contract, but instead changed the wording to include three prototypes of the entirely different G-79. It was this design that became the Panther.

At that time, the few American engines that were available for use, such as the Allison J33 and Westinghouse J34, were not considered to be sufficiently reliable; thus, the Navy specified the imported Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet, which was also more powerful, at of thrust. Production aircraft were to also be powered by the Nene, built under license by Pratt &amp; Whitney as the J42. Since there was insufficient space within the wings and fuselage to provide sufficient fuel for the thirsty jet engine, the design team opted to add permanently mounted wingtip fuel tanks, which had incidental advantage of improving the fighter&#x27;s rate of roll. The wings featured another innovation in the form of leading edge flaps that generated additional lift while landing; speed brakes were also present on the underside of the fuselage.

===Flight testing===
On 21 November 1947, the prototype Panther conducted its maiden flight, piloted by test pilot Corky Meyer. It was followed by the second prototype only five days later. Initial issues with directional and longitudinal stability were encountered, but were quickly rectified. During one early land-based arresting gear test, the detachable rear section of the aircraft unintentionally came off; remedial changes were made to avoid any future repetition.

During May 1949, carrier suitability trails commenced. In September 1949, the F9F was cleared for flight from aircraft carriers. During the development phase, Grumman decided to change the Panther&#x27;s engine, selecting the Pratt &amp; Whitney J48-P-2, a license built version of the Rolls-Royce RB.44 Tay. The other engine that had been tested was the Allison J33-A-16. The armament was a quartet of 20 mm guns, the Navy having already switched to this caliber (as opposed to the USAAF/USAF which continued to use .50 caliber M2/M3 guns). In addition, the Panther was soon armed with underwing air-to-ground rockets and up to of bombs.

From 1946, interest in developing an aircraft that harnessed the increasingly popular swept wing grew and, following concerns that the Panther was inferior to its MiG opponents over the skies of Korea, Grumman launched work on a conversion project, known as Design 93. This effort resulted in a swept-wing derivative, the F9F Cougar, which retained the Panther&#x27;s designation number. Later stage development work on the Panther continued, being largely focused on engine improvements, expanding fuel capacity, and the use of alternative munitions.

In 1949, the Panther was considered by the Australian government, as a possible locally-built replacement for the Mustang Mk 23 and De Havilland Vampire then operated by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The other designs considered initially were an Australian design, the CAC CA-23 (an unconventional, twin-jet all-weather fighter) and the Hawker P.1081. By mid-1950, however, RAAF Mustangs were in action in Korea and seen as highly vulnerable to the MiG-15. An immediately available stop-gap in the shape of the Gloster Meteor F.8 was operated by the RAAF in Korea from July 1951. (After its less-than-satisfactory performance against MiGs, the Meteor was replaced from 1954 by the CAC Sabre – an Australian-built, up-engined variant of the F-86.)

==Operational history==

===US Navy===
The Panther was the primary jet fighter and ground-attack aircraft of both the US Navy and USMC during the Korean War. It was the widest used Navy jet fighter of the conflict, cumulatively flying 78,000 sorties. F9F-2s, F9F-3s and F9F-5s, as rugged attack aircraft, were able to sustain operations despite being frequently opposed by intense anti-aircraft fire. The pilots also appreciated the air conditioned cockpit, which made for a welcome change from the humid environment of piston-powered aircraft.

On 3 July 1950, Lieutenant, junior grade Leonard H. Plog, of VF-51, flying an F9F-3 scored the first US Navy air victory of the war by shooting down a propeller-powered Yak-9.

Despite their relatively low speed, Panther pilots also claimed seven Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s, for the loss of two F9Fs. The first MiG-15 was downed on 9 November 1950, by Lieutenant Commander William (Bill) Amen of VF-111 flying an F9F-2B, during a UN Command attack on the Sinuiju bridges, near the mouth of the Yalu River. Two more MiG-15s were downed on 18 November 1950.

On 18 November 1952, the American aircraft carrier and three other carriers were operating in the Sea of Japan conducting air strikes against the North Korean city of Hoeryong. The group launched four F9F&#x27;s for a combat patrol near the North Korean border with China. The group&#x27;s leader suffered mechanical problems and returned to the carrier together with his wingman. Lt Royce Williams of VF-781, flying off and his wingman continued on the mission. They then identified seven Soviet Naval Aviation Migs heading towards the task force from the Russian mainland. The naval commanders therefore ordered the two F9Fs to position themselves between the Migs and the carrier group.

During this maneuver, four Soviet MiG-15s opened fire, despite the fact that the countries were not at war. Williams opened fire on the tail Mig, which dropped out of formation, and was followed down by Williams&#x27; wingman. What followed was a 35-minute dogfight between Williams and six MiG-15s. The Mig 15 was a more capable plane, but Williams nevertheless succeeded in shooting down three more. He ascribed this to both sides doing as they were trained, but the Soviet pilots making mistakes. While heading back to the carriers, Williams was out of ammo, but still had one Mig on his tail. The re-appearance of his wingman on the Mig&#x27;s tail then scared this one off. By that time Williams&#x27;s plane was so damaged that he could not turn sideways anymore. &quot;Oriskany&quot; was therefore aligned with the plane, so he could land. After landing, his Panther was found to have 263 hits by cannon shells or fragments and was beyond repair. It was therefore pushed overboard.

The engagement is little-known for two reasons. The US feared that publication of the incident could increase tensions with the Soviet Union. Another reason was the involvement of the US National Security Agency (NSA) – the existence of which was then top secret – in planning the mission; the MiGs were intercepted as a result of intelligence provided by the NSA. The four MiGs that were shot down were flown by Soviet Naval Aviation pilots: Russian sources confirmed Williams&#x27; claims, 40 years later, stating the pilots lost were Captains Belyakov and Vandalov, and Lieutenants Pakhomkin and Tarshinov.

As the conflict progressed, Panthers became primarily tasked with ground attack missions. Attacks upon hostile anti-aircraft equipment were commonly conducted. This was a risky mission type, with numerous Panthers being damaged or even lost to fire from the same ground batteries that they were seeking to neutralize. Furthermore, the danger posed by these systems increased over time as more capable AA apparatus was supplied to the North Korean force. Panthers also routinely undertook aerial reconnaissance missions over Korea. Starting in 1952, the Panther began to be supplemented by the newer Cougar derivative in the theatre.

Future astronaut Neil Armstrong flew the F9F extensively during the Korean conflict, although he ejected from one of the aircraft after it was brought down by a wire strung across a valley in 1951. Future astronaut John Glenn and Boston Red Sox all-star baseball player Ted Williams also flew the F9F as Marine Corps pilots.

During 1956, the Panther was withdrawn from frontline combat service, having been displaced by new fighter aircraft, including its swept-wing Cougar derivative. However, the type remained active in secondary roles, such as for training and with U.S. Naval Air Reserve and U.S. Marine Air Reserve units, until 1958. The Navy&#x27;s Blue Angels flight demonstration team used the Panther for four years, beginning in 1951. The Panther was the Blue Angels&#x27; first jet. Some Panthers continued to serve in small numbers into the 1960s. From September 1962, surviving operational Panthers were designated F-9 within the new combined US tri-service designation system.

===Argentine Navy===

The only foreign buyer of the Panther was the Argentine Naval Aviation, which purchased 28 ex-USN F9F-2B aircraft during 1957; the first 10 arrived in 1958. Only 24 aircraft were put in service, as the remainder were used as spares. The first flight of an Argentine Panther was in December 1958, and the last aircraft entered into service during January 1961.

The catapult on the then only Argentine carrier, ARA &quot;Independencia&quot;, was not powerful enough to launch the F9F, so the aircraft were land-based. However, in July 1963, a Panther (serial 0453/3-A-119) landed on &quot;Independencia&quot; as part of trials, the first jet to land on an Argentine aircraft carrier; it was not then catapult-launched, but off-loaded by crane when the ship returned to port.

Argentine Navy F9F-2 Panthers were engaged in combat during the 1963 Argentine Navy Revolt. Several rebel-controlled aircraft flew bombing and strafing runs against a column of the Army 8th Tank Regiment which was advancing on the rebelling Punta Indio Naval Air Base. The attack destroyed several M4 Sherman tanks while one F9F Panther was shot down.

The Argentine Panthers were involved in the general mobilization during the 1965 border clash between Argentina and Chile, but no combat occurred. The type was removed from service during 1969 due to a lack of available spare parts, the service opted to replace them with Douglas A-4Q Skyhawks.

The Argentine Navy also operated the F-9 Cougar trainer version.

==Variants==

;XF9F-2

==Specifications (F9F-5 Panther)==


==Notable appearances in media==

The F9F Panther was featured in the 1954 Korean War film &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; starring William Holden, Grace Kelly, Mickey Rooney and Fredric March, and in &quot;Men of the Fighting Lady&quot; starring Van Johnson, Walter Pidgeon and Keenan Wynn. 

Stock footage of an F9F piloted by George Chamberlain Duncan crashing into the fantail of the USS &quot;Midway&quot; (CV-41) during a 1951 test flight appears in several Hollywood films.
* In 1954&#x27;s &quot;Men of the Fighting Lady&quot;, the crash is portrayed as the death of Lieutenant Commander Ted Dodson (played by Keenan Wynn).
* In the 1976 film &quot;Midway&quot;, the F9F footage stands in for an SB2C Helldiver crash-landing.
* In the 1990 film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, the F9F footage is used to depict the crash-landing of an F-14A Tomcat that had collided with a Soviet aircraft onto the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CVN-65), reenacting an incident from Tom Clancy&#x27;s original novel.

<doc id="489627" wikidata="Q3138084" url="?curid=489627" title="Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States">
<text>The postage stamps and postal system of the Confederate States of America carried the mail of the Confederacy for a brief period in U.S. history. Early in 1861 when South Carolina no longer considered itself part of the Union and demanded that the U.S. Army abandon Fort Sumter, plans for a Confederate postal system were already underway. Indeed, the Confederate Post Office was established on February 21, 1861; and it was not until April 12 that the American Civil War officially began, when the Confederate Army fired upon U.S. soldiers who had refused to abandon the fort. However, the United States Post Office Department continued to handle the mail of the seceded states as usual during the first weeks of the war. It was not until June 1 that the Confederate Post Office took over collection and delivery, now faced with the task of providing postage stamps and mail services for its citizens.

The C.S. Constitution had provided for a national postal service to be established, then required it to be self-financing beginning March 1, 1863 (Section 8. Powers of Congress, Item 7). President Jefferson Davis had appointed John Henninger Reagan on March 6, 1861, to head the new Confederate Post Office Department. The Confederate Post Office proved to be very efficient and remained in operation for the entire duration of the Civil War.

==Beginnings==
During the first seven weeks of the Civil War, the U.S. Post Office still delivered mail from the seceded states. Mail that was postmarked after the date of a state&#x27;s admission into the Confederacy through May 31, 1861, and bearing U.S. (Union) postage is deemed to represent &#x27;Confederate State Usage of U.S. Stamps&#x27;. i.e., Confederate covers franked with Union stamps. After this time, private express companies still managed to carry the mail across enemy lines. The three major express companies in operation throughout the south were Adams Express, American Letter Express, and Whiteside&#x27;s Express. They had been operating freely for approximately two months when the U.S. Post Office ordered an end to such traffic, effective August 26, 1861. Mail destined to states that were not among their own unions now had to be sent by &quot;Flag of Truce&quot;, although some express companies still continued to run their mail operations illegally; Adams continued its Southern operations under a nominally-separate Southern Express Company, in actuality a subsidiary. Mail was also smuggled in and out by blockade-running ships—which, however, were often captured or destroyed by Union ships on blockade patrol. Because Confederate post offices existed for only a few years and official and informal records of them are lacking, relatively little is known about their operations in many regions of the South. Existing data has been studied by several experts in the field, who have reconstructed an account of their existence and operation largely from surviving Confederate covers (stamped-addressed envelopes), and by researchers specializing in advanced studies of Confederate philately, notably Colonel Harvey E. Sheppard, United States Army, Fort Hood, Texas; the late Van Dyk MacBride, Newark, New Jersey; George N. Malpass, St. Petersburg, Florida; Earl Antrim, Nampa, Idaho; David Kohn, Washington, D. C., and a few others, each contributing material in the concerted effort to create an overall account of Confederate postal history.

==Confederate Post Office==

One of the first undertakings in establishing the Confederate Post Office was the appointment of John H. Reagan (1818–1905) to Postmaster General, by Jefferson Davis in 1861, making him the first Postmaster General of the newly formed Confederate Post Office. Reagan was a Democratic congressman from Texas (many years after the Civil War, Texas would elect him to a Senate seat). Upon appointment Reagan became a close friend of Davis and was Postmaster General for the duration of the war, making him the only PMG of the short-lived Confederacy. In preparation for wartime mail delivery Reagan proved to be very resourceful. He sent an agent to Washington, D.C. with letters asking the various heads of the U.S. Post Office Department to come work for the new Confederate Post Office. Amazingly nearly all of them did, bringing copies of records and account books along with them. &quot;Reagan in effect had stolen the U.S. Post Office,&quot; notable historian William C. Davis wrote. Reagan was obviously an able administrator, presiding over the only C.S.A. cabinet department that functioned well during the war. It established new rates rather higher than those in the Union: 5¢ (equal to $ today) per half-ounce under , 10¢ per half-ounce over , 2¢ for and circulars. Later the under- rate was raised to 10¢ also. There was a 50¢ rate for express mail, and after 1863 a 40¢ rate for Trans-Mississippi mail to cover the costs of smuggling the mail through a Federal blockade that operated along the entire length of the lower Mississippi River. At the beginning of the war, Union blockades prevented supplies from reaching their destinations in the South, which from time to time resulted in the shortage of postage stamps, paper and other basic supplies that were much needed throughout the Confederate states. 

Although the Confederate government had contracted for the printing of its own stamps, they were not yet available on June 1, forcing postmasters all over the South to improvise. Most of the time they simply went back to the old practice of accepting payment in cash and applying a &quot;PAID&quot; hand-stamp to the envelope. However, a number of postmasters, particularly those in the larger cities, could not afford to be handling long lines of cash customers, and developed a variety of Postmaster&#x27;s provisionals. These took a variety of forms, from envelopes prestamped with a postmark modified to say &quot;paid&quot; or an amount, to regular stamps produced by local printers. Some are today among the great rarities of philately.

==Confederate postage==

Within a month after his appointment as Postmaster General, Reagan ordered that ads be placed in both Southern and Northern newspapers seeking sealed proposals from printing companies for producing Confederate postage stamps. Bids arrived from companies in New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New Orleans, and Richmond. After the war started, however, it became evident that the contract to print Confederate stamps should go to a Confederate firm. The Confederate Post Office Department therefore awarded the contract to lithographers Hoyer &amp; Ludwig, a small firm in Richmond. The stamps they produced were inferior in image quality to the line engraved stamps printed by the U.S. Post Office, but with what resources they had, they produced some handsome images by many accounts. The first Confederate postage issues were placed in circulation in October 1861, five months after postal service between the North and South had ended. Jefferson Davis is depicted on the first issue of 1861. The appearance of a living person on a postage stamp marked a break from the tradition adhered to by the U.S. Post Office, that a person may be depicted on U.S. postage or currency only after death.

===Provisional stamps===

During the five months between the U.S. Post office&#x27;s withdrawal of services from the seceded states and the first issue of Confederate postage stamps, postmasters throughout the Confederacy used temporary substitutes for postal payment. Postmasters had to improvise and used various methods to apply confirmation of postage to mailed covers, ranging from the creation of their own adhesive postage stamps to the marking of letters with either rate-altered hand-stamps or the manuscript indication &quot;Paid.&quot; The improvised stamps and pre-paid covers are known to collectors as &#x27;Postmaster Provisionals&#x27;, so-called because they were used &#x27;provisionally&#x27; until the first Confederate general postage stamp issues appeared. Some Confederate post offices would subsequently experience shortages in postage stamps and would revert to the use of Provisional stamps and hand-stamps. There are many dozens of types of Provisional stamps and hand-stamps from different towns and cities about the Confederacy. In some circles, Postmaster Provisionals are referred to as &#x27;locals&#x27; since they were intended only for use from the town in which they were issued.

The following places are known to have issued such provisionals. [Where a name appears (other than in manuscript) on the stamp(s), such as that of the Post Master [P.M.] or printer, this is appended here in &quot;italics&quot;]:

===Postage stamps===
As the Confederate States existed for only four years, it was able to issue only a modest number of postage stamps, nine basic types in all. During this brief span, the Confederate Post Office contracted with five different printing companies to produce postage stamps: Archer &amp; Daly of Richmond, Virginia; Hoyer &amp; Ludwig of Richmond, Virginia; J. T. Paterson &amp; Co. of Augusta, Georgia; Thomas de la Rue &amp; Co., Ltd., of London, England; and Keatinge &amp; Ball of Columbia, South Carolina. Among them, these firms employed all three methods of printing commonly in use at that time: &quot;lithography,&quot; &quot;typography&quot; and &quot;line-engraving&quot;. The first Confederate Postage stamps were issued and placed in circulation on October 16, 1861, five months after postal service between the North and South had been suspended.
* The first postage stamp issued by the Confederate States (1861) was a 5¢ green depicting Jefferson Davis. It was printed by the lithograph process by Hoyer and Ludwig of Richmond, Virginia. Like almost all Confederate issues, these stamps were imperforate, and single stamps had to be cut from the sheet with razors or scissors. This stamp was reprinted in blue in 1862.
* A 10¢ blue with Thomas Jefferson also appeared in 1861, designed by Charles Ludwig of Hoyer &amp; Ludwig, Richmond, Virginia. This issue was printed by two different companies: Hoyer &amp; Ludwig and, later, J. T. Paterson &amp; Co. of Augusta, Georgia. The image of Thomas Jefferson used on both printings lithographically reproduced the same image that had been engraved on the U.S. 5-cent issue of 1856. &quot;Secret marks&quot; were added by the Paterson firm to the transfer stones to distinguish its version from the Hoyer &amp; Ludwig prints of the same design. The most typical use was for the ten-cent rate after July 1, 1862. This stamp, like the 5¢ Davis, was reprinted in 1862, in a rose-colored version that is considerably rarer than the blue original.
* In 1862, a 2¢ stamp of Andrew Jackson appeared, in green, and was issued imperforate. This issue was again lithographed by Hoyer &amp; Ludwig of Richmond, Virginia. Only one transfer stone used in this printing. The earliest known usage of this stamp was March 21, 1862. Sheets of this issue consisted of two panes of 100 stamps each arranged in two blocks of fifty (10X5) taken from the 50-subject transfer stone with a wide vertical gutter between panes. This was the last lithographed stamp produced by the Confederate Post Office.
* Also in 1862, a new 5¢ stamp of Davis, this time utilizing typography, was issued in large quantities. Produced by the De La Rue firm in London (which had been supplying postage stamps for England since 1855), it employed an engraving of Davis by Ferdinand Joubert (1810–1884). De La Rue shipped 12,000,000 copies of this issue to the Confederacy, accompanied by a set of printing plates and a supply of English paper so that additional copies could be produced locally. More than 36,000,000 of the 5¢ Davis stamps were subsequently printed from the De La Rue plates by Archer &amp; Daly in Richmond. Archer &amp; Daly eventually ran out of the English paper, and their later printings on Confederate paper tended to become increasingly coarse, with individual examples exhibiting blank areas in the design from plate damage or filled in areas due to plate wear. (Today they can be purchased for approximately US$10 depending on condition.)
* De La Rue also printed and shipped a typographed 1¢ orange stamp depicting John C. Calhoun. The Confederate Post Office had planned to reduce the drop-letter rate to one cent, but this proved impractical and, as a result, the 1¢ stamp was never put into use. Joubert De La Ferte again engraved the central image of Calhoun, placing it in the same framework design used for the Jefferson Davis 5-cent issue, a clear attempt to show that the two stamps were part of the same series. (Later, De La Rue sent altered plates of both typographed stamps to the Confederacy with revised denominations, intended for 2-cent Calhoun and 10-cent Davis issues, but neither stamp was put into production. The printed versions of these that are sometimes seen all date from the 20th century, and cannot be considered true Confederate stamps.)
* In 1863, a new 2¢ Jackson design appeared, engraved in steel by Frederick Halpin (1805–1880) and printed by Archer &amp; Daly in pale red. A second printing appeared in brown red. Line-engraving would be employed in all subsequent Confederate stamps.
* Also in 1863, a 10-cent stamp was released bearing the profile of Jefferson Davis in blue. This issue was designed and engraved on steel by John Archer and transferred to either copper plates or steel plates. Many shades of exist for these stamps, ranging from light milky blue and darker blue to shades that tend toward greenish blue and green. There are four similar designs of engraved ten cent stamps.
* The easiest to distinguish from the other three has the value expressed as &quot;TEN&quot;. The portrait of Jefferson Davis was designed and line engraved by John Archer, and then transferred to a copper plate. This issue was imperforate and was printed on soft, porous paper of varying thickness and with colorless gum. The earliest recorded usage is April 23, 1863. Color variations occur from dark-blue to gray-blue.

* The next easiest to distinguish (on which the value is expressed as &quot;10&quot;) has straight lines enclosing the design in a rectangle. Several distinct shades of blue occur in this printing. The earliest recorded usage is April 23, 1863. All of these were printed by Archer and Daly of Richmond. This &quot;frame-line&quot; variety is by far the rarest of the stamps issued by the Confederate Post Office. Even poor copies shorn of most of the framing can command prices upwards of US$1000.
* Type I, initially printed by Archer &amp; Daly, Bank Note Engravers, Richmond, Virginia, employs the same engraving as the &quot;Frame Line&quot; issue but without the frame lines. There were approximately 23,800,000 stamps printed from two plates, each with two panes of one hundred. The earliest recorded usage is April 21, 1863.
* Type II, also at first printed by Archer &amp; Daly, is very similar to type I. Frederick Halpin designed and engraved the image of Davis. The corner ornaments are filled, and a faint line follows the outside of the design and encloses it. The Archer &amp; Daly plates for both Type I and Type II were moved from Richmond to Columbia, South Carolina, when the fall of Richmond became imminent in late 1864. The company of Keatinge &amp; Ball then printed the two stamps. A small number of Types I and II in Archer &amp; Daly printings were perforated and released for use by the Confederate Post Office Department in 1864. The perforations (gauge ) on these were often of notably poor quality, and forgeries abound, many of which betray themselves by perforations that either employ the wrong gauge or are cut too crisply.
* A 20¢ stamp with George Washington also appeared in 1863, again employing a design engraved in steel by Halpin and printed by Archer &amp; Daly. This issue saw only limited use, with the result that genuine used copies are today worth 10 times more than mint examples.

==Covers==

A considerable number of Confederate covers (i.e. stamped - addressed envelope) survived the Civil War and through the many years since they were mailed and have been avidly sought after and preserved by historians and collectors alike. The war had divided family members and friends across the country, and letter writing naturally increased dramatically, especially to and from the men who were away serving in an army. Letters written by soldiers reveal how they would frequently ask parents, wives and family members to write often and to also ask others to write letters back to them. As mail sent to and from the soldiers became more commonplace in the mail streams of the divided states, various Christian charity groups provided pens, paper and envelopes for the soldiers in response to their constant need for these items, since soldiers on active duty during wartime rarely had the opportunity to buy these things. The variety of mail from this time period provides the student of Civil War history with an excellent cross-reference of the history involved then. Special categories of interest include covers to and from soldiers, patriotic covers, prisoner-of-war covers, Flag of Truce and through-the-lines mail, mail carried by blockade runners to and from Europe, and a variety of other types. All of these specialties have been intensively studied. Although contemporary official records are often fragmentary or missing, and many details remain unclear, the covers with their addresses, dated postmarks, special markings and the letters themselves have provided much insight for historians and collectors in their studies of Civil War postal history. Some forging of material went on in the late 19th century, and authentication is a challenge for experts. As a rule of thumb a collector should be wary of fancy cancels on Confederate mail, as the C.S.A. Post Office never used fancy cancels. Other common types of forgeries include added stamps to a cover and forged postmarks. Another common oversight of the forger is postmarking stamps with dates before the stamp was issued. Many collectors over the years have marked or destroyed fakes and forgeries upon identification in an effort to keep the collecting pool safe from such material. This is a practice common to most of philately.

===Prisoner of war mail===

During the American Civil War the number of Union and Confederate soldiers in prisoner of war prisons and camps would reach an astonishing one and a half million men. The prison population at the Andersonville Confederate POW camp alone reached 45,000 men by the war&#x27;s end. At the onset of the war the United States did not recognize the legitimacy of the Confederate States and refused to establish a system that allowed for a formal prisoner and mail exchange. By the summer of 1862, more than a year into the war, prison populations in the north were at alarming proportions and the U.S. government began to see the necessity of a prisoner and mail exchange system. On July 2, 1862 it signed what was referred to as a &quot;Prisoner exchange cartel&quot;, and by September of that year prison populations were almost emptied. However, as the war dragged on the U.S. government had increasing distrust for the Confederate government and stopped the prisoner and mail exchanges in June 1863, less than a year after it had signed the exchange agreement. &quot;Flag of Truce&quot; mail exchanges resumed a month later and were used until the end of the war. Prisoner mail that was carried by Flag-of-Truce had to be put in an unsealed envelope with address and postage for delivery on the other side, then placed in an outer cover for delivery to the exchange point where the outer envelope would be destroyed and the inner envelope containing the prisoner&#x27;s letter was inspected. The letter would then be placed in and sealed in the stamped addressed envelope and hand-stamped indicating that the item had been inspected. Often correspondents did not observe the two-envelope regulation, so there are examples of covers where instead of an inner and outer envelope arrangement both U.S. and Confederate postage was applied to the prisoner&#x27;s letter and where both U.S. and Confederate markings were applied. These covers are often referred to as &quot;dual-use postage covers&quot;. Mail exchange between the divided states was only allowed to cross the lines at specified exchange points. Mail which was going from the North destined to points in the South passed primarily at City Point, Virginia, while most of the mail going from the South to the North passed through at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, and usually bear an Old Point Comfort postmark. A prisoner&#x27;s cover was usually docketed with the prisoner&#x27;s name, rank, and company. The marking, &quot;Examined&quot;, on the face of the cover, usually in manuscript, indicated that the cover had been opened and examined by prison officials. Once at the exchange point, the outer envelope was removed and discarded while the inner cover containing the prisoner&#x27;s letter was examined by military officials and delivered. There also exist covers that were carried to transfer points by exchanged prisoners and consequently bear no confederate examiner&#x27;s markings. Mail to and from the various military prisons and prison camps is one of the most intriguing and challenging areas in Civil War postal history. Letters addressed &quot;to&quot; the various prisoner of war prisons are in most cases much scarcer than letters sent &quot;from&quot; these facilities. The south had its paper shortages and, because Confederate prisons limited the amount of correspondence, mail from Confederate prisons is much rarer than mail from Union prisons.
===Prisoner of war prisons and camps===

When the Civil War got underway, both sides were ill-prepared to deal with the very large numbers of captured troops. For a time a prisoner and mail exchange program was in use that lasted until June 1863, when the U.S. government terminated any further cooperation due to mounting war tensions and increased mistrust. The postmarks and stampings found on wartime mail from military prisons and camps during the war are sought after by historians and collectors, not only for their souvenir value but also as confirmation that various people, events and places existed at the time of mailing indicated by the name, address, postmark and other official markings. The mailed covers often bear the postmark of the nearest town or city from where the prison or camp was located. The study of Civil War military postal history and postmarks is an area of philately that involves a great volume of material covering town names, history, rarity, postmarks, and other official markings found on mail to and from POW facilities. In the navigation boxes below are two partial lists of some of the larger prison facilities, Union and Confederate, in operation during some or all of the war. Numbers for inmate totals are included to provide insight into knowing the amount of any surviving mail that is or may be in existence. There were also prison facilities that contained much smaller numbers of prisoners (a couple listed here) also. Records for some prison facilities are completely lacking, the total numbers of prisoners held, peak prison population amounts, escapes and deaths remaining unknown at the present time. Surviving prisoner of war mail to or from some of these places is exceedingly rare, and in some cases no covers are known to exist.

===Blockade mail===
At the onset of the American Civil War it was imperative for the Confederacy to get crucial correspondence to suppliers and other mail into and out of the country. On April 19, 1861, President Lincoln proclaimed a blockade along the entire coastline of the Confederacy to prevent it from obtaining supplies and to prevent it from communicating with the rest of the world by means of mail. Twelve major ports and approximately of coastline along the Confederate States were patrolled by some 500 ships that were commissioned by the U.S. Navy; however, some accounts vary considerably and place the number of commissioned ships for blockade patrol at about 200, taking into account the high numbers of Union ships that were withdrawn from blockade duty for repairs. The blockade played a major role in the Union&#x27;s victory over the Confederate states. By the end of the Civil War, the Union Navy had captured more than 1,100 blockade runners and had destroyed or run aground another 355 vessels. The Union blockade reduced a vital source of revenue for the south, cotton exports, to a fraction of what they were prior to the war, as well as preventing much of its mail from being sent or received. In response to the blockade various specially-built steamers were built and put to use by British investors who were heavily invested in the cotton and tobacco trade. These vessels were typically smaller and lighter in weight, often giving them an advantage of maneuverability and record speeds of up to 17 knots, which enabled them to evade or outrun Union ships on patrol. Their cargoes were usually small, light-weight and often included mail.

===Blockade runners===
During the beginning of the Civil War, getting Confederate mail in and out of the Confederacy to and from foreign suppliers and other interested parties overseas posed a problem. At first, getting a ship through the Union blockade was easier, but as the war progressed the number of Union ships on blockade patrol increased while veteran crews were becoming more experienced and growing wiser to the evasive tactics employed by blockade-runners. To escape detection, blockade-runners would often try to get the mail and cargo through by making night runs, especially when the moon was new. Many of the vessels were also painted a dark gray color to help them blend in with the backdrop of the night sea, a practice that earned these vessels the nickname of &quot;Greyhounds&quot;. Some of the steamers also burned a smokeless anthracite coal which greatly reduced their profile against the horizon. However, as the war went on, the prospect of getting a ship through diminished greatly, and many of these ships faced capture or destruction, their cargoes and mail never reaching their ports of destination. As many of the vessels used as blockade-runners were built in England for British investors, the captured crews and passengers were usually British also. The cargo aboard was rewarded to the captain and crew of the capturing vessel, it is assumed as an added incentive for captains and crews on blockade patrolling ships to be extra vigilant. Mail was also confiscated and sometimes used as evidence against the parties involved with the ship and its cargo. Consequently, inbound covers that were prepared by forwarding agents for transfer to and delivery within the Confederacy never received various postmarks or other markings from the Confederate post office.

Among the most notable blockade runners were steamers like the SS &quot;Syren&quot;, a steel-hulled sidewheel steamer that made a record 33 successful runs through the Union blockade. Another steamer called the &quot;Alice&quot;, a steel-hulled vessel, made 24 successful runs, while the &quot;Kate&quot;, a wooden-hulled steamer, made 20 successful runs before being run aground in November 1862. It is likely that most of the blockade runners brought mail into the Confederate mail stream, as the Confederate states were in dire need of basic supplies, the procurement of which was conducted through mailed correspondence. The various cargoes would likely have mail attached to them to notify various parties that their shipment has arrived at port. Today, Confederate blockade covers are highly sought after by collectors and historians who often regard these mailings as figurative time-stamps and historical confirmation that various people, ships and post offices existed in and among these times and places.

The principal transfer points for mail arriving from or destined to Europe and other locations were Nassau in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Cuba. Ships carrying letters that were addressed to points in the Confederacy would deposit their cargo of mail at one of these transfer points. Here the inbound mail was handled by a &quot;forwarding agent&quot; who would remove the mail or inner cover and prepare it for transfer on a blockade runner. Often the forwarding agents would apply their own markings to the cover of mail. Mail placed aboard a blockade runner would then, perhaps with some luck, make its way to the ports of New Orleans, Charleston, or Wilmington, where it was received by Confederate postal operators who would then include it in with the regular Confederate mail for delivery. The captain of the blockade runner would typically get two cents for every letter he delivered to port, which was a nominal sum, as his main source of revenue was from delivering his cargo. The average number of successful runs by a blockade runner was only about four, many of them meeting a fateful ending on their first run. Various ports along the coastline of the Confederacy saw the most traffic from blockade runners. Charleston in South Carolina was particularly well situated as a port for blockade runners with their shallow drafts, as was the Port in Wilmington in North Carolina which saw the most traffic. Because the lower Mississippi River was being blockaded effectively dividing the Western Confederate states from those east, New Orleans became one of the busiest of ports. Consequently, many blockade covers have postmarks from these locations.

===Patriotic covers===
The years during the American Civil War were a period marked with strong sentiments and loyalties towards both sides involved, and this sentiment is clearly displayed on various Civil War correspondence known to collectors and historians as &quot;Patriotic Covers&quot;. Citizens, many of whom had family members and friends off fighting in the war, or who had died in battle, often expressed their loyalties with envelopes illustrated with flags, portraits, slogans and allegorical figures such as that of &quot;Liberty&quot;, which clearly captured the sentiments of that time. This practice was most evident in the North where there were many printers, especially in the larger cities, who produced an assortment of envelopes that proudly displayed these designs and which quickly became popular among the citizenry. The situation in the south was quite different. The demand for printers in the agrarian South was much less, and consequently established and qualified printers were generally nonexistent throughout most of the Confederacy. The South also lacked the North&#x27;s industrialized advantages and supplies, and so the various Confederate patriotic covers that have survived the years are scarce and rare and usually have considerable value.

===Adversity covers===
Due to the Union blockade, the South was unable to get many needed basic supplies including paper, and as such envelopes and writing paper were scarce throughout most of the South. People would reuse old paper and envelopes, bags, and old forms and sometimes would use wallpaper to construct envelopes with. These covers are usually referred to by collectors as &quot;adversity covers&quot;.

===Mourning covers===

&quot;Mourning covers&quot; are also widely collected. These are covers which bear signs of sympathy or recognition of an adverse event. The most common type of adversity cover that occurs in Civil War postal history, Confederate or Union, are what is referred to by collectors as &quot;Mourning&quot; covers. Many families shared in the loss of loved ones and friends who died in battle during the four-year war. Letters of sympathy were often sent between family members and friends. The covers often bear various markings, usually pen inscribed by the sender. One of the most common markings found on these covers is the symbolic &quot;black border&quot; put about the outer face of the envelope. As many thousands of men died during the war, the black border became commonplace in the Union and Confederate mail streams and in Civil War philately.

===Manuscript covers===

:&quot;Manuscript covers&quot; are addressed envelopes that were designated as &quot;Paid&quot; or where the amount of postage due was hand-written with pen and ink. Manuscript markings can also be found along with various hand-stamp markings, or in combination with postage stamps, which were sometimes applied prior to or after the manuscript marking(s). If the manuscript cover was mail carried by a blockade runner, the cover is usually referred to then as a &quot;blockade cover&quot;, and so forth with &quot;patriotic&quot; and other covers.

<text>Andrew William Stanfield (December 29, 1927 – June 15, 1985) was an American sprinter and Olympic gold and silver medallist.

==Biography==
Andy Stanfield born in Washington, D.C., but moved to Jersey City as a child. He graduated from Lincoln High School in 1946, where he was already a talented athlete, excelling in the sprints and long jump. After his army service, Stanfield entered Seton Hall University in 1948. The following year, he won his first of a long list of national titles. His list includes six AAU titles (1949: 100 and 200 m; 1950: 60 y; 1951: long jump; 1952: 200 m; 1953: 220 y) and nine IC4A titles (both indoor and outdoor). He was coached by Johnny Gibson, a former world record holder in 400 m hurdles.

Internationally, the 200 m was Stanfield&#x27;s strongest distance. In 1951, at the ICAAAA Championships, Stanfield—in the outside lane—won the Turn 220-Yard Dash in 20.6. The Turn-220 had never been commonly contested in the US. 220s were normally raced on &quot;NoTurn&quot; or &quot;Straight&quot; courses. In 1951 the IAAF commenced to establish world records for the Turn-200-Meters: the initial listing accepted was by Willie Applegarth of Great Britain in 21 1/5, set in London in 1914. That spring of 1951, Stanfield&#x27;s Intercollegiate 220-Yard Dash in 20.6 was established by the IAAF as a new World-Record for the 200 m with 20.6 (220 yards is more than one meter longer than 200 meters).

Then, there was no &quot;official&quot; world record for the Turn-220. But in the United States, Ralph Metcalfe was generally agreed to have the American record at 21-flat set in Berlin 1933 (no wind). Then Jack Wierhauser of Stanford University clocked 20.9 (no wind) in 1936 at a US Olympics Trials at Randalls Island. Jesse Owens clocked 20.7 at the Berlin &#x27;36 Games with wind. Barney Ewell, at the US Nationals in 1939 at Lincoln, Nebraska, on the partial bend course on that track, clocked what was likely an AAU record of 21.1, but that course was never well-delineated. At the 1948 US Olympic Trials, Mel Patton beat Barney Ewell, both clocked in 20.7 (no wind). None of these were ratified for the simple reason that the IAAF did not distinguish between records made on a turn from those on a straight.

Stanfield would equal this performance twice, running 20.6 in 1952 and 1956. The &#x27;56 performance occurred at the AAU Championships, where Stanfield finished 2nd behind Thane Baker, the champion. As the world record holder, Stanfield in 1952 was not a surprise winner of the gold medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics, equalling the Olympic Record in the final. As a member of the American 4 x 100 m relay team, Stanfield won a second Olympic gold medal. He attempted to defend his 200 m title in the 1956 Games, but lost it, finishing second to Bobby Morrow.

Stanfield was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

<text>The Vermont Progressive Party, formerly the Progressive Coalition and Independent Coalition, is a political party in the United States that is active in Vermont. It is the third-largest political party in Vermont behind the Democratic and Republican parties. , the party has one member in the Vermont Senate and five members in the Vermont House of Representatives, as well as several more affiliated legislators who caucus with the Democratic Party.

The last time a third-party had members elected to the state legislature in Vermont was in 1917, with the election of James Lawson of the Socialist Party of America.

==History==
===Background===
William H. Meyer, a member of the Democratic Party, was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Vermont&#x27;s at-large congressional district after defeating Republican nominee Harold J. Arthur in the 1958 election. Meyer&#x27;s victory was the first time since the 1853 election that the Republicans had lost a statewide election in Vermont. Meyer was the most left-wing member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, according to Keith T. Poole. He lost reelection in the 1960 election against Republican nominee Robert Stafford.

Meyer formed the Liberty Union Party at a meeting in his home with Peter Diamondstone, Dennis Morrisseau, and twenty other people on June 27, 1970. Martha Abbott, a future chair of the Vermont Progressive Party, was one of the members of the Liberty Union Party&#x27;s founding meeting. Bernie Sanders joined the party in 1971, and was selected to serve as the party&#x27;s candidate for a Senatorial special election at his first meeting. During his time in the party, Sanders also ran for United States Senate in the 1974 election and for Governor in the 1972 and 1976 elections. Sanders left the party on October 11, 1977.

===Progressive Coalition===
====Sanders====
On November 8, 1980, Sanders announced that he would run for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in the 1981 election and formally announced his campaign on December 16, at a press conference in city hall. Sanders had been convinced to run for the mayoralty by Richard Sugarman, an Orthodox Jewish scholar at the University of Vermont, who had shown Sanders a ward-by-ward breakdown of the 1976 gubernatorial election which showed Sanders receiving 12% of the vote in Burlington despite only getting 6% statewide. Sanders defeated incumbent Democratic Mayor Gordon Paquette by ten votes in the election. Sanders was reelected as mayor in the 1983, 1985, and 1987 elections.

During his mayoral campaign, Sanders formed the Independent Coalition which according to Richard Sartelle was to bring working people, students, college faculty, union members, and all independent-minded citizens together. Sartelle ran with the support of the Independent Coalition for a seat on the city council from the 4th district, but was defeated by the Republican nominee.

The Citizens Party attempted to have Greg Guma run with their nomination for mayor in 1981, but Guma declined as it would be &quot;difficult to run against another progressive candidate&quot; and the party instead endorsed Sanders. Terry Bouricius, a member of the Citizens Party, was elected to the city council from the 2nd district becoming the first member of the party elected to office in Vermont.

Following his victory in the 1981 election, Sanders faced difficulties with the city council; this was because 11 of the 13 members of the board of alderman opposing Sanders. The council would oppose measures proposed by Sanders and override his vetoes on legislation. Bouricius and Sadie White were the only members of the city council aligned with Sanders. 

During the 1982 elections, Sanders endorsed Citizens nominees Richard Musty and Zoe Breiner, and independent candidate Gary DeCarolis for city council and all of them won causing the council to have five pro-Sanders members, five Republican members, and three Democratic members. However, the Republicans and Democratic members of the city council united to select Robert Paterson, a Republican, as president of the city council instead of Sadie White, a Sanders supporter, by a vote of eight to five after six ballots and to prevent the pro-Sanders members of the city council from receiving positions. Sanders stated that &quot;Probably the Democrats feel more comfortable dealing with the Republicans than with us&quot;.

DeCarolis asked for members of the media to referred to him and other pro-Sanders members of the city council as the Progressive Coalition rather than as just Sanders supporters. An organizational meeting for Progressive Coalition, which was attended by over 100 people, was held on November 10, 1983. The Progressive Coalition was not a political party, but an organization that gave out endorsements. 

During the 1984 elections, the Citizens Party only ran one candidate under its name and instead endorsed the Progressive Coalition candidates. Bouricius stated that the Citizens Party was the core of the coalition, but that the coalition was being built broader than the Citizens Party. The Progressive Coalition gained one seat from the Democratic Party during the 1984 city council elections bringing the composition of the city council to six Progressive members, five Republican members, and two Democratic members. The Citizens Party of Vermont disbanded in 1986.

The Progressive Coalition supported Jesse Jackson during the 1984 Democratic presidential primaries and later supported Walter Mondale in the presidential election in the state.

Bouricius was selected to serve as president of the city council after thirty-one ballots and served until 1985. Bouricius was the only member of the Progressive Coalition to serve as president during Sanders&#x27; administration. After the 1985 elections William Skelton, a Republican member of the city council, was selected to serve as president of the city council against the Progressive-backed Zoe Breiner as Bouricius had dropped out.

====Clavelle====
The Vermont Progressive Alliance was formed by members of the Progressive Coalition and Rainbow Coalition on May 19, 1990, at Montpelier High School and inspired by the New Democratic Party. The organization endorsed ten independent candidates for seats in the state legislature in the 1990 election. Terry Bouricius and Tom Smith, who were endorsed by the organization, were elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in the 1990 election becoming the first member of the Progressive Coalition to do so. The Vermont Organizing Committee was formed by the organization in 1992.

The Franklin County Independent Coalition was also formed in 1990, to support Sanders&#x27; campaign for a seat in the United States House of Representatives during the 1990 election. The organization was founded by independent candidates for seats in the state house and Neil Bean, who was an independent member of the St. Albans city council and also grew out of Jeff Weaver&#x27;s campaign for mayor of St. Albans and Jerry Colby&#x27;s 1988 and 1990 campaigns for a seat in the Vermont Senate.

The Progressives regained control of the city council in 1994, with five of their members winning and three independents caucusing with them. The coalition expanded to Brattleboro, Vermont, with Shoshana Rihn&#x27;s election to the town&#x27;s select board in 1998. Rihn was sworn in, but was removed from office after a recount reported her losing by two votes.

===Vermont Progressive Party===
====Clavelle====
The coalition started holding caucuses in twenty-five towns in October 1999, to form a political party. The Vermont Progressive Party was formally created after organizing in sixteen communities and held its first convention on July 9, 2000. Anthony Pollina receive the party&#x27;s gubernatorial nomination for the 2000 election and received 9.6% of the vote, more than the 5% needed for major party status.

====Kiss====
====Post-Kiss====
Emma Mulvaney-Stanak was the only Progressive member of the fourteen-member city council following the resignation of Marisa Caldwell in 2010, which was the lowest number for the party since 1981. The party ran and received its highest number of candidates, votes, and share of seats in the state house in the 2016 election with seven out of twenty candidates winning with a combined total of 18,954 votes.

David Zuckerman was elected lieutenant governor after he used electoral fusion to receive both the Democratic and Progressive nominations.

Robin Chesnut-Tangerman, the leader of the Progressive caucus in the state house, lost reelection in 2020. Mollie Burke and Heather Surprenant did not seek reelection with the Progressive ballot line in the 2022 state house elections and solely ran as Democrats. The 2022 elections, in which the party lost two state house and one state senate seat, resulted in the entire Progressive delegation being solely from Chittenden County for the first time since 2004. Zuckerman returned to the lieutenant governorship in the concurrent election.

==Platform==
The Progressive Party encompasses a progressive platform. The party&#x27;s main focus has historically been advocacy for a single-payer health care system, which supported the implementation of Green Mountain Care, a health care program that was pushed by Democratic Governor Peter Shumlin due to pressure from the Progressive Party. Other major policy platforms are renewable energy programs and a phase-out of nuclear energy, public transportation proposals including one for a high-speed rail system, criminal justice reforms directed at reducing the state&#x27;s prison population and better protecting convicts&#x27; rights, the creation of programs to end homelessness in the state, ending the War on Drugs and repealing No Child Left Behind and ending the focus on standardized testing in the school system. The party also has an anti-war stance, advocating for Vermont&#x27;s national guard to be restricted from engaging in war zones outside the United States, an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and opposition to all preemptive wars, strikes, or other offensive or interventionist military actions. The party is very supportive of LGBT rights and members of the party were involved in the legalization of same-sex marriage in the state.

Economically, the party also calls for converting the minimum wage to a living wage and having it tied to inflation rates, having the economy focus on small and local businesses, empowerment of worker cooperatives and publicly owned companies as democratic alternatives to multi-national corporations and to decentralize the economy, for the strengthening of state law to protect the right to unionize, for implementing a progressive income tax and repealing the Capital Gains Tax Exemption and residential education property tax, and for all trade to be subject to international standards on human rights. The party is also critical of privatization.

<text>Christian Campbell (born May 12, 1972) is a Canadian actor. He is known for his roles as Gabriel in the film &quot;Trick&quot; and Greg Ivey in the television series &quot;Big Love&quot;. On stage, he has performed as Jimmy Harper in the musical &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; and Jon in the musical &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot;.

== Early life ==
Campbell&#x27;s mother, Marnie (née Neve), is a yoga instructor and psychologist from Amsterdam, Netherlands, who also ran a theatre in Guelph, Ontario. His father, Gerry Campbell, a Scottish immigrant to Canada from the East End of Glasgow, Scotland, taught high school drama classes in Mississauga, Ontario — first at Westwood Secondary School (now Lincoln M. Alexander Secondary School), later at Lorne Park Secondary School, and now at Erindale Secondary School. Campbell&#x27;s maternal grandparents ran a theatre company in the Netherlands and his paternal grandparents were also performers. On his mother&#x27;s side, Campbell descends from Sephardi Jews who immigrated to the Netherlands and converted to Catholicism.

Campbell&#x27;s parents divorced when he was three years old. His siblings are actress Neve Campbell, actor Alex Campbell, and Damian McDonald. He and his sister, Neve, resided largely with their father (who received custody of the two), with regular periods at their mother&#x27;s home. Born into an acting family (his maternal grandparents having been actors in Amsterdam) and his father an acting teacher, Campbell began training at an early age. He was acting professionally by the age of fourteen and attended Claude Watson School for the Arts in Toronto, Ontario.

== Film ==

Campbell starred in the gay-themed romantic comedy &quot;Trick&quot; in 1999. The feature film was a Sundance Grand Jury Prize nominated film. It grossed the most per-screen average for a gay-themed film at the time. In celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of the picture, Campbell spoke of the social climate at the time and how he, a straight actor, had taken on a gay role. &quot;Having been in that movie... opened up a community,&quot; he said. &quot;The gay community was incredibly supportive of me.&quot;

In 2001, Campbell teamed up with &quot;Trick&quot; co-star John Paul Pitoc in the feature-film &quot;Thank You, Good Night&quot;, co-starring with Mark Hamill and Sally Kirkland. He then starred in the 2004 short film &quot;Pretty Dead Girl&quot;. In 2009, Campbell starred in the feature film &quot;Neighbor&quot; along with America Olivo, who would later become his wife. He played conservative American political activist Ralph Reed in the 2010 movie &quot;Casino Jack&quot;.

Campbell starred along with Amy Smart in director Russell Friedenberg&#x27;s 2014 feature film &quot;Among Ravens&quot;.

== Television ==

At the age of 16, Campbell made his television debut on the Canadian television series &quot;Degrassi High&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s first starring role was in the television movie &quot;City Boy&quot;, in which he starred alongside James Brolin and Sarah Chalke. Campbell then starred in the 1995 ABC telefilm &quot;Picture Perfect&quot;. He moved to the United States in 1995 where he was soon cast as Teddy Delacourt in producer Aaron Spelling&#x27;s primetime teen drama/soap opera Malibu Shores.

Campbell joined the cast of &quot;The $treet&quot; in 2000 as Tim Sherman. He then starred in the science fiction-action animated series Max Steel from 2000 to 2002, providing the voice of the protagonist, Josh McGrath, a 19-year-old fictional extreme sports star. Campbell joined &quot;All My Children&quot; as the recast Bobby Warner from 2004 to 2005, replacing Brian Gaskill for the role after a seven-year absence for the character. Along with Shannon Elizabeth, he starred in the 2008 made-for-TV movie &quot;You Belong To Me&quot;.

Before its abrupt cancellation, he had a starring role in the NBC drama &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot;.

In May 2010, Campbell had a guest-starring role as victim Ben Rooney in &quot;&quot; season 8, episode 21, &quot;Meltdown&quot;.

In 2013, Campbell joined the cast of the Lifetime original movie &quot;An Amish Murder&quot;, in which he played the brother of Kate Burkholder, who was played by his real life younger sister, Neve Campbell.

Campbell has a recurring role in the second season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Detective&quot;. He can also be seen playing the villain Pierce Peters in the 2015 Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;.

== Theatre ==

Campbell&#x27;s theatre training began early and was extensive due to his father being an acting teacher and his mother&#x27;s acting background. His earliest acting roles were on the stage for his father&#x27;s panto productions for the Association for Scottish Traditions and Arts in Etobicoke, Ontario. Campbell said of his early work with his father that &quot;Dad was always throwing Neve and me on the stage. The pantos are comedies, sort of fantasies-sometimes fairy tales like Jack and the Beanstalk. In these shows there&#x27;s a lot of humor, and always a cross-dresser. That&#x27;s part of the genre.&quot; His first starring role on the stage was as the role of Nick in &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;, which was held at his mother&#x27;s dinner theatre. He then toured Europe in the early 1990s, acting in stage plays such as &quot;Der Ritter Von Mirakel&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; at the Schaulspielhaus, Nürnberg.

Shortly after his move to Los Angeles in 1995, Campbell co-founded the theatre company Blue Sphere Alliance. He began producing stage plays while working as an actor. Campbell made his directorial debut with &quot;Reach&quot;, a one-act play that starred Matthew Lillard and Sandra Thigpen. In 2000, Campbell produced his first off-Broadway play, &quot;Trust&quot;, in New York City. Campbell starred in &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; in 2001. 

He joined Jonathan Larson&#x27;s &quot;tick... tick... BOOM!&quot; in 2002, in which he performed on a national tour of the United States and in London at the Menier Chocolate Factory (July – September 2005). Campbell went on to work on &quot;Great Expectations&quot; with Kathleen Chalfant in 2004. In 2009, he played Jason Dean in a workshop of &quot;&quot;.

In July 2015 it was announced that Campbell would lead the cast of Harold Chapin&#x27;s &quot;The New Morality&quot; at the Mint Theater.

== Other work ==

Campbell has been a photographer for the last two decades and showcases his work on his personal website.

He currently sits on the board of directors of the Players Club in New York City.

He served as producer and director of the documentary concert series &quot;Live from Gramercy Park&quot; and is the producer and director of the &quot;Broadway Dreams&quot; documentary series. Both series are produced by Campbell and wife America Olivo&#x27;s production company EsoteriCam Productions.

== Personal life ==
Campbell met his second wife, actress America Olivo, in 2009 on the set of the horror film &quot;Neighbor&quot;. They were engaged after two weeks and married five months later on July 5, 2009, in a ceremony on Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Their first child, a daughter, was born in 2012, but died only days later due to the genetic condition Edwards syndrome.

After facing infertility issues of their own, Campbell and his wife decided to become spokespeople for the BabyQuest Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that is &quot;dedicated to helping couples and/or individuals build families through advanced fertility treatments&quot;. The couple had a second daughter in 2019.

<text>Gregory La Cava (March 10, 1892 – March 1, 1952) was an American film director of Italian descent best known for his films of the 1930s, including &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; and &quot;Stage Door&quot;, which earned him nominations for Academy Award for Best Director.

==Career==
La Cava was born in Towanda, Pennsylvania. His father was a shoemaker, and the family moved to Rochester, New York. La Cava reported for the &quot;Rochester Evening News&quot; and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. He was a member of the Art Students&#x27; League.

===Animator===
Around 1913, he started doing odd jobs at the Barré Studio. By 1915, he was an animator on the &quot;Animated Grouch Chasers&quot; series.
Towards the end of 1915, William Randolph Hearst decided to create an animation studio to promote the comic strips printed in his newspapers. He called the new company International Film Service, and he hired La Cava to run it (for double what he was making with Barré). La Cava&#x27;s first employee was his co-worker at the Barré Studio, Frank Moser. Another was his fellow student in Chicago, Grim Natwick (later to achieve fame at Disney). As he developed more and more of Hearst&#x27;s comics into cartoon series, he came to put semi-independent units in charge of each, leading to the growth of individual styles.

La Cava also had the significant advantage over other studios of an unlimited budget: Hearst&#x27;s business sense completely broke down when it came to his Hearst-Vitagraph News Pictorial and the &quot;living comic strips&quot; they contained. La Cava&#x27;s main fault as a producer and director was that his cartoons were too clearly animated comic strips, hampered by speech balloons when rival Bray Studio was creating more effective series with original characters. He was apparently aware of this fault, and he had his animators study Charlie Chaplin films to improve their timing and characterization. But he didn&#x27;t have time to achieve very much, because in July 1918, Hearst&#x27;s bankers caught up with him and International Film Service was shut down.

Hearst still wanted his characters animated, so he licensed various studios to continue the IFS series. La Cava and most of the IFS staff got jobs with John Terry&#x27;s studio (not surprising since John Terry himself was an IFS alumnus). This only lasted a few months before Terry&#x27;s studio went out of business. The animators were immediately hired by Goldwyn-Bray (as Bray Productions was now known), but La Cava was not, since Goldwyn-Bray had several producers of its own and La Cava was not interested in starting over. Instead, he moved west to Hollywood.

===Live action reels and features===
By 1922, La Cava had become a live-action director of two-reel comedies, the direct competitor to animated films. Among the actors he directed in the silent era are:

*Bebe Daniels (&quot;Feel My Pulse&quot;, 1928)
*Richard Dix
*W. C. Fields (&quot;So&#x27;s Your Old Man&quot;, 1926 and &quot;Running Wild&quot;, 1927) He became a good friend and drinking companion of Fields.

La Cava worked his way up to feature films in the silent era, but it is for his work in sound films of the 1930s—especially comedies—that he is best known today. And though he did not always get credit, he also often had a hand in creating the screenplays for his films. Among the sound films he directed are:
*&quot;Laugh and Get Rich&quot; (1931) with Edna May Oliver and Hugh Herbert

*&quot;The Half-Naked Truth&quot; (1932) with Lupe Vélez and Lee Tracy
*&quot;The Age of Consent&quot; (1932) for RKO, starring Richard Cromwell, Eric Linden, and Dorothy Wilson.
*&quot;Symphony of Six Million&quot; (1932) for RKO, based on a story by Fannie Hurst and starring Ricardo Cortez and Irene Dunne, which featured one of the first symphonic scores of the talkie era by Max Steiner.
*&quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (1932) with Constance Bennett and Pert Kelton
*&quot;Gabriel Over the White House&quot; (1933) with Walter Huston
*&quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot; (1934) with Helen Hayes
*&quot;The Affairs of Cellini&quot; (1934) with Constance Bennett and Fredric March
*&quot;Private Worlds&quot; (1935) with Claudette Colbert, Charles Boyer and Joel McCrea
*&quot;She Married Her Boss&quot; (1935) with Claudette Colbert and Melvyn Douglas
*&quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1936, nominated for the Best Director Academy Award) with William Powell and Carole Lombard
*&quot;Stage Door&quot; (1937, also nominated for Best Director) with Katharine Hepburn, Adolphe Menjou, and Gail Patrick, as well as his first of three consecutive films with Ginger Rogers
*&quot;Fifth Avenue Girl&quot; (1939) with Ginger Rogers and Walter Connolly
*&quot;Primrose Path&quot; (1940) with Ginger Rogers and Joel McCrea

During the 1940s, his career floundered when his output dropped severely. He only officially directed one film after 1942, &quot;Living in a Big Way&quot; (1947).

==Personal life and death==
La Cava and his first wife, Beryl, had a son. They were divorced in 1937. On December 2, 1940, La Cava married Mrs. Grace O. Garland, widow of William J. Garland. He died on March 1, 1952, in his sleep in his home. His remains were buried at Chapel of the Pines Crematory.

<text>Slava (, ) is a family&#x27;s annual ceremony and veneration of their patron saint. The ceremony is found mainly among Orthodox Serbs. 

Although its origin is unknown, this old tradition is an important ethnic marker of Serbian identity. It is a tribute to the family&#x27;s first ancestor, through the male lineage, who was baptized into Christianity, with its presiding saint. The family celebrates the Slava annually on the saint&#x27;s day. In 2014, it was inscribed on UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists of Serbia.

&quot;Slavski kolač&quot;, also known simply as &quot;kolač&quot;, is a ritual bread often prepared during the celebration of the Slava. 

== History ==
=== Origin theses ===

Serbian historians consider that records of Slava amongst Serbs can be traced back at least to 1018. However, the true origin of the Slava is unknown. According to one hypothesis, the Slava has its origins in Greek and Roman hero cult. Proponents of the Greek hypothesis point to etymology in that the Serbian word for wheat, &quot;koljivo&quot;, an indispensable item of the Slava, is derived from the Greek term for gain of wheat, &quot;koliva&quot;. Proponents of the Roman hypothesis point to the fact that Slava customs mimic Roman forms of celebration including bread breaking and toasting. Another hypothesis states that the Slava has its origin in Medieval Serbia, connected to Saint Sava, the first Archbishop of the Serbs. There are indications that the institution of the Slava in the Serbian Orthodox Church dates from Saint Sava, that &quot;in his understanding and tactful approach to Serbian folk religion&quot;, he &quot;seems to have found a compromise formula satisfactory to both his people&#x27;s pagan tradition and the requirements of theology&quot;. The slava is a reinterpretation of a Serbian pagan rite: the ancestor-protector became a Christian saint, frequently St. Nicholas, with the pagan rite being reduced of many religious elements and frequent ceremonies and becoming a social event with the annual meeting of the family and friends.

In the scientific literature exists a discussion about the historical and ethnological origin of the Slava, which has not been completed. According to some Serbian researchers, &quot;the thesis of how Slava is Serbian ethnic identification marker is simply delusion of the romantic and patriotic citizenry&quot;.

=== Modern ===
The increased effective geographic mobility brought about by the post World War II urbanization of a previously highly agrarian society, combined with the suppression of Serbian Orthodox traditions under the Communist rule, has made some aspects of the custom more relaxed. In particular, in the second half of the 20th century it became common to see traditional patriarchal families separated by great distances, so by necessity Slava came to occasionally be celebrated at more than one place by members of the same family.

While the &quot;Slava&quot; kept something of a grassroots underground popularity during the Communist period, the post-Communist revival of Serbian Orthodox traditions has brought it a resurgence. It is recognized as a distinctly (if not quite exclusively) Serbian custom, and today it is quite common for nonobservant Christians or even atheists to celebrate it in one form or another, as a hereditary family holiday and a mark of ethnocultural identification.

The custom is also helpful in genealogical studies as an indicator in kinship relations between families, such as tracing one&#x27;s family to a specific region. It &quot;becomes a simultaneous signifier of national and spiritual kinship and a core expression of the Serbian cosmology, whereby the dialectics of temporal, physical, and spiritual continuity converge into validated perceptions of cultural and social reality—re-enacted on a recurrent (annual) basis.

In November 2014 it was inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists of Serbia.

== Practicing groups ==
The tradition is an important ethnic marker of Serbian identity. The slogan: (, ) was raised as a Serbian national identifier by Miloš Milojević after his travel to Kosovo and Metohija in 1871–1877. Serbs usually regard the Slava as their most significant and most solemn feast day. The tradition is also very well preserved among the Serb diaspora.

Besides present day Serbia, Slava is commonly celebrated amongst ethnic Serbs living in neighbouring Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro. Despite the tradition being inherently tied to Serbian Orthodox Christianity it is also practiced to a lesser extent amongst some Catholic and Muslim ethnicities in the region, occasionally among Croats, as well as Catholics from the Bay of Kotor, and Gorani living in present-day southern Kosovo. Furthermore, similar tradition can be found in Western Bulgaria and North Macedonia and also among some Vlachs and Aromanians.

== Customs and feast ==

The Slava is a family&#x27;s annual ceremony and veneration of their patron saint. It is a tribute to the family&#x27;s first ancestor who was baptized into Christianity, with its presiding saint. The family&#x27;s patron saint is passed down from father to son and only men are allowed to carry out the Slava&#x27;s rituals. Upon marriage, women typically adopt the patron saint of their spouse although it is not uncommon for them to continue celebrating their native family&#x27;s saint as well (in which case the secondary one is known as &quot;preslava&quot;). Close friends and family gather at the home for a ritual feast. Although a religious ceremony for the purpose of saint veneration, the family&#x27;s intent behind the celebration is for &quot;the good health of the living&quot; as well as for a &quot;general remembrance of the souls of the departed family members&quot;. Many Serbian communities (villages, cities, organizations, political parties, institutions, companies, professions) also celebrate their patron saint. For example, the city of Belgrade celebrates the Ascension of Jesus Christ as its patronal feast.

A Slava celebration incorporates aspects of pagan traditions with minimal clerical involvement. The ritual foods that are prepared for the feast are the &quot;slavski kolač&quot; (or simply &quot;kolač&quot;), a ritual bread, and &quot;koljivo&quot; (or &quot;žito&quot;), a dish of minced boiled wheat, sweetened and sometimes mixed with chopped walnuts. A beeswax candle stamped with an image of the saint is also a staple at the celebration.

Prior to the slava, a priest surrounded by family members blesses the house. This is done in front of the saint&#x27;s icon and the lit candle whereby the priest recites a prayer. Every room in the house is then sprinkled with holy water along with the members of the family who are each named and wished good health.

The top of the &quot;kolač&quot; is adorned with the Christian cross, the peace dove, and other symbols. The kolač symbolizes the body of Jesus, and the wine with which the kolač is eaten represents his blood. The parish priest, either at the home or at the church, consecrates the kolač with wine; afterwards the man of the household cuts it into quarters and turns it cut-side up. It is further cut into pieces by other family members and oldest or most important guests, a total of three times. In other traditions the bread is &quot;broken&quot; together by the guests after being ritually turned. The &quot;koljivo&quot; is a symbol of the Resurrection of Christ (cf. &quot;if the grain does not die...&quot; in the Gospel) and partaken in memory of the dead (deceased family members). The cutting into the bread three times is a symbolism of the Holy Trinity.

The rest of the feast consists of a meal, the contents of which depends on whether or not the celebration falls in a period of fasting. During a fast (&quot;post&quot;), the meal would not contain any meat but seafood (pesco-vegan). Outside of a fasting period, these restrictions would not apply and the Slava is considered &quot;mrsna&quot;. Thus, colloquially, &quot;slavas&quot; can be referred to as &quot;posna&quot; or &quot;mrsna&quot;. Appropriately-made sweets are consumed, as well. Alcohol is served to adults.

The most common feast days are St. Nicholas (&quot;Nikoljdan&quot;, 19 December), St. George (&quot;Đurđevdan&quot;, 6 May), St. John the Baptist (&quot;Jovanjdan&quot;, 20 January), St. Demetrius (&quot;Mitrovdan&quot;, 8 November), St. Michael (&quot;Aranđelovdan&quot;, 21 November) and St. Sava (&quot;Savindan&quot;, 27 January). Dates given are according to the Gregorian calendar. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar.

<text>XIV Corps was a corps-sized formation of the United States Army.

==Interwar period==

===XIV Corps (I)===

The XIV Corps was authorized by the National Defense Act of 1920 and was to be composed of units of the Organized Reserve located primarily in the Fourth Corps Area. The Headquarters and Headquarters Company were constituted on 29 July 1921 in the Regular Army, allotted to the Fourth Corps Area, and assigned to the Fifth Army. The Headquarters was organized in January 1922 with Reserve personnel at Birmingham, Alabama. The Headquarters Company was organized in April 1923 with Reserve personnel at Birmingham. The Headquarters was withdrawn from the Regular Army on 1 October 1933 and demobilized.

===XIV Corps (II)===

The second iteration of the XIV Corps was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 1 October 1933, allotted to the Fourth Corps Area, and assigned to the Third Army. The Headquarters was concurrently initiated at Birmingham, Alabama, with Reserve personnel previously assigned to the demobilized XIV Corps (RAI). The designated mobilization station was Camp McClellan, Alabama, where the corps Headquarters would assume command and control of its subordinate corps troops, which would then be mobilizing throughout the Fourth Corps Area. It was redesignated on 1 January 1941 as Headquarters, XIV Army Corps. The XIV Corps was not activated prior to World War II and was located in Birmingham as of 7 December 1941 in a reserve status.

==World War II==

The history of XIV Corps in World War II dates from December 1942. Then, under Major General Alexander Patch, the XIV Army Corps directed the American 23rd Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Divisions, the 2nd Marine Division, and the 147th Infantry Regimental Combat Team in the final drive that expelled the Japanese from Guadalcanal early in February 1943. The 70th Coast Artillery Regiment (Anti-Aircraft) landed on 23 May 1943. From air fields guarded by the XIV Army Corps, Allied aircraft began the neutralization of the enemy&#x27;s vital Munda airfields on New Georgia.

Major General Oscar Griswold succeeded Patch as XIV Corps commander on 26 April 1943. In a lightning campaign, which began 30 June 1943 with the invasion of Rendova Islands, General Griswold&#x27;s forces, which included the 43rd (New England) and the 37th (Buckeye) Infantry Divisions with elements of the 25th Division, seized New Georgia and the important Munda airfield on 6 August. Mopping up the adjacent islands was completed and the New Georgia campaign ended on 6 October 1943. American and New Zealand aircraft operating from the Munda field began the neutralization of Kahili and other enemy airfields in Bougainville.

XIV Corps defeated the once fine Japanese 17th Army on Bougainville in March 1944. Part of this army was the Sixth Infantry Division, which was considered Japan&#x27;s best division in the early Chinese campaigns and played a major part in the Rape of the Chinese city of Nanking in 1937.

In the Bougainville campaign, the 37th and Americal Divisions, and two battalions of the Fiji military forces, were the principal combat units of XIV Corps. Elements of the 93rd (Negro) Infantry Division arrived after the peak of the battle and assisted in harassing retreating Japanese troops. There were 65,000 Japanese on Bougainville when the Americans landed, of whom some 8,200 died in combat and 16,600 from illness.

The three airfields in the Bougainville perimeter were used as bases for allied aircraft that reduced the once mighty Japanese air and naval base of Rabaul, New Britain, to an impotent outpost of the enemy&#x27;s island empire. The first raid on Truk, a large Japanese air and naval base in the Central Pacific, was staged through Bougainville by Liberators of the Thirteenth Air Force.

From the Solomons campaigns, XIV Army Corps gained the nickname &quot;Kings of the Solomons&quot;.

===Liberators of Manila===

XIV Army Corps with its initial divisions, the 37th and the 40th (Sunshine) Infantry Division, landed on the shores of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, Philippines, on S-Day, which was 9 January 1945. The landing was made without ground opposition as the Japanese garrison, completely surprised, fled three days before S-Day at the start of an intensive naval and aerial bombardment.

Meeting sporadic resistance, the corps drove rapidly south towards Manila, capturing successively Binmaley, San Carlos, Malasiqui and Tarlac. At Bamban, the enemy was strongly entrenched in the 40th&#x27;s sector in the foothills of the Zambales Mountains. Attacking abreast, the 37th and 40th sufficiently reduced the resistance to allow the 37th to continue on to Manila. The 40th was left to contain and exterminate the stubbornly resisting Japanese.

The 1st Cavalry Division from Guimba began a drive to Manila overrunning the towns of Cabanatuan, Santa Rosa and Garapan, and by 1 February 1945, the 37th and the 1st Cavalry were poised north of Manila ready for the battle for the Philippines&#x27; capital city.

On 2 February, elements of the 11th Airborne Division made an airborne and amphibious invasion of Nasugbu on the west coast of Batangas Province, 32 miles southwest of the former American naval base of Cavite. This move was to seal off the Japanese forces south of Manila. The 11th, passing to XIV Corps control, began a push toward a junction with columns of the 37th and 1st Cavalry.

On 3 February, the 1st Cavalry entered Manila liberating 3,700 American internees at Santo Tomas and the next day soldiers of the 37th marched into Bilibid Prison freeing 800 American civilians and soldiers captured on Bataan and Corregidor in 1941.

Resistance was quickly reduced north of the Pasig River, but the Japanese fought ferociously in Southern Manila. Forces of the 37th, 1st Cavalry and 11th Airborne joined up in Manila on 13 February. Meanwhile, the 6th (Red Star) Infantry Division joined XIV Corps on 17 February and attacked well fortified enemy forces in the Shimbu Line east of Manila. In an amphibious, air, para-troop, ground assault, elements of the 11th Airborne Division aided by elements of XIV Corps Special Troops, freed 2,100 American internees from Los Banos Prison Camp, 23 February.

Main enemy resistance collapsed with the taking of the ancient walled city of Intramuros on 24 February by the 37th Division. Mopping up was completed in three public building that had been fortified by the Japanese and in Manila Bay, where Japanese has set up defenses in the hulks of sunken ships.

The cleanup of Southern Luzon with the 1st Cavalry and the 11th Airborne comprising major corps units was begun 15 March, and by 20 May the area was declared free of Japanese organized resistance. Then on 1 July, the corps with the 6th, 32nd (Red Arrow), 37th and 38th (Cyclone) Division began the cleanup of Northern Luzon.

<text>Sisy Chen or Chen Wen-chien (; born 25 March 1958) is a Taiwanese journalist, television commentator, writer and former politician. She hosts &quot;Sisy&#x27;s World News&quot;, a weekly newscast at the Chung T&#x27;ien Television and &quot;UFO Dinner&quot;, a daily radio talk show at UFO Radio. She was an independent member of the Legislative Yuan from February 1, 2002 to January 31, 2005. Since 2005, she also hosted a political talk show on the Phoenix Television, &quot;Jie Ma Chen Wen Qian&quot; which focuses on exposing the flaws of Taiwan&#x27;s democratic system.

==Biography==

She received her LL.B. from National Taiwan University. From 1982 to 1983 she worked as the Vice Editor of the American Version of the China Times Daily News. Throughout the early 1980s, she campaigned for Tangwai candidates and published opposition essays. As a founding member of the Democratic Progressive Party in 1984, she was editor of the opposition&#x27;s New Tide magazine from 1985 to 1986.

Chen then travelled to the United States to pursue a doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley and later at the New School for Social Research in New York City. She did not complete her studies.

In the early 1990s, Sisy Chen remained active in Taiwanese society as a member of the UN Minority Group for Asia, the chairperson of the Taiwan Relations Center&#x27;s office of the UN, and the producer for Italian National Broadcast&#x27;s Asia Department. TVBS voted her No. 4 in its 1995 top ten list in Taiwan. In 1996, she worked as General Manager of Song Records. As she gained more fame as an outspoken and blunt commentator, her position in the Democratic Progressive Party rose and she was appointed director of the DPP Culture and Information Department. Beginning in 1998, she hosted &quot;Women&#x27;s Talk&quot; on TVBS and promoted women&#x27;s issues.

Sisy Chen, an ally of Hsu Hsin-liang, left the DPP in 1999 and emerged as one of its harshest critics. In 2001, as an independent, she won a seat in the Legislative Yuan representing South Taipei City. That same year she accepted a KMT controlled position on the board of Taiwan Television (TTV) and became spokesperson of the Mountain Alliance, a pro-unification think tank that included Hsu Hsin-liang and Shih Ming-teh.

She was a strategist for the Pan Blue Coalition in the 2004 ROC presidential election and debated Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on the March 20 referendum. In the night before the election, she invited a celebrity panel to her show and made the first high-profile claim that the shooting of Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu earlier that day was probably staged. Some Pan-Blue officials believe this early accusation was a factor Lien-Soong&#x27;s defeat as it alienated swing voters who switched over to the DPP in Chen&#x27;s sympathy.

In 2003 Sisy Chen and Wu Cherng-dean joined the PFP legislative caucus.

During a press conference on March 19, 2004 she said that the assassination attempt on Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu was staged. This caused her to receive political attacks from the blue-camp legislators.

She did not seek reelection in December 2004 and supported her friend Li Ao in his successful bid for a seat. In 2005, Chen published her new book. During the press conference, she revealed her thought of regarding herself as a re-incarnation of a witch in her previous life. She also confessed her deeper ache for love than before.

Outside politics Sisy Chen has been active in the media. From 2002 to the present time, Sisy Chen hosted &quot;Wen Qian Xiao Mei Da,&quot; a talk show aimed at exploring and exposing political and social issues in Taiwan. In 2005, Sisy Chen became a host of &quot;Jie Ma Chen Wen Qian,&quot; a talk show on Phoenix TV. On her TV shows, Sisy Chen frequently criticized the democratic system of Taiwan.

In 2006 Chen Shui-bian announced that he would file a lawsuit against Sisy Chen for her statement that Chen Shui-bian was going to use a scheduled trip to Palau to ship valuables of his away from Taiwan.

<doc id="489641" wikidata="Q1153195" url="?curid=489641" title="Rhinencephalon">
<text>In animal anatomy, the rhinencephalon (from the Greek, ῥίς, &quot;rhis&quot; = &quot;nose&quot;, and ἐγκέφαλος, &quot;enkephalos&quot; = &quot;brain&quot;), also called the smell-brain or olfactory brain, is a part of the brain involved with smell (i.e. olfaction). It forms the paleocortex and is rudimentary in the human brain.

==Components==
The term &quot;rhinencephalon&quot; has been used to describe different structures at different points in time.

One definition includes the olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, anterior olfactory nucleus, anterior perforated substance, medial olfactory stria, lateral olfactory stria, parts of the amygdala and prepyriform area.

Some references classify other areas of the brain related to perception of smell as rhinencephalon, but areas of the human brain that receive fibers strictly from the olfactory bulb are limited to those of the paleopallium. As such, the rhinencephalon includes the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tract, the olfactory tubercle and striae, the anterior olfactory nucleus and parts of the amygdala and the piriform cortex.

==In different species==
The development of the rhinencephalon varies among species. In humans it is rudimentary. A small area where the frontal lobe meets the temporal lobe and the area of cortex on the uncus of the parahippocampal gyrus (both belonging to the olfactory cortex) have a different structure (so called &quot;allocortex&quot;) than most of the telencephalon and are phylogenetically older (so called paleocortex).

<doc id="489642" wikidata="Q203572" url="?curid=489642" title="Three-spined stickleback">
<text>The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a fish native to most inland and coastal waters north of 30°N. It has long been a subject of scientific study for many reasons. It shows great morphological variation throughout its range, ideal for questions about evolution and population genetics. Many populations are anadromous (they live in seawater but breed in fresh or brackish water) and very tolerant of changes in salinity, a subject of interest to physiologists. It displays elaborate breeding behavior (defending a territory, building a nest, taking care of the eggs and fry) and it can be social (living in shoals outside the breeding season) making it a popular subject of inquiry in fish ethology and behavioral ecology. Its antipredator adaptations, host-parasite interactions, sensory physiology, reproductive physiology, and endocrinology have also been much studied. Facilitating these studies is the fact that the three-spined stickleback is easy to find in nature and easy to keep in aquaria.

== Evolution ==

The three-spined stickleback appears to be a rather old species that has remained morphologically unchanged for more than 10 million years. The oldest record of the species is from the Alta Mira Shale of the Monterey Formation of California, which preserves an articulated skeleton that appears essentially identical to the modern &quot;G. aculeatus&quot; complex. A slightly younger specimen is known from diatomite deposits from Lompoc that also belong to the Monterey Formation. Both specimens are known from marine deposits, suggesting a marine or anadramous lifestyle. The presence of the three-spined stickleback in the Miocene suggests that the three-spined stickleback complex must have diverged from the blackspotted stickleback prior to this point.

The iconic evolutionary traits of the three-spined stickleback, including rapid evolution in isolated environments, reduction of armor &amp; pelvis, and ecological divisions into different niches, appear to have been a longstanding tendency of the &quot;Gasterosteus&quot; lineage. These traits are all present in a fossil stickleback, &quot;Gasterosteus doryssus&quot;, known from Miocene-aged freshwater deposits of the Truckee Formation in Nevada, US, which saw rapid evolution and morphological change over a period of several thousand years.

==Description==
This species can occasionally reach lengths of , but lengths of at maturity are more common. The body is laterally compressed. The base of the tail is slender. The caudal fin has 12 rays. The dorsal fin has 10–14 rays; in front of it are the three spines that give the fish its name (though some individuals may have only two or four). The third spine (the one closest to the dorsal fin) is much shorter than the other two. The back of each spine is joined to the body by a thin membrane. The anal fin has eight to 11 rays and is preceded by a short spine. The pelvic fins consist of just a spine and one ray. All spines can be locked in an erect position, making the fish extremely hard to swallow by a predator. The pectoral fins are large, with 10 rays. The body bears no scales, but is protected by bony plates on the back, flanks, and belly. Only one ventral plate is present, but the number of flank plates varies greatly across the distribution range and across habitat types (see below); it is normally higher in marine populations (some freshwater populations may in fact lack lateral plates altogether).

Dorsal coloration varies, but tends towards a drab olive or a silvery green, sometimes with brown mottling. The flanks and belly are silvery. In males during the breeding season, the eyes become blue and the lower head, throat, and anterior belly turn bright red. The throat and belly of breeding females can turn slightly pink. A few populations, however, have breeding males which are all black or all white.
==Habitat and distribution==

The three-spined stickleback is found only in the Northern Hemisphere, where it usually inhabits coastal waters or freshwater bodies. It can live in either fresh, brackish, or salt water. It prefers slow-flowing water with areas of emerging vegetation. It can be found in ditches, ponds, lakes, backwaters, quiet rivers, sheltered bays, marshes, and harbours.

In North America, it ranges along the East Coast from Chesapeake Bay to the southern half of Baffin Island and the western shore of Hudson Bay, and along the West Coast from southern California to the western shore of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It can be found throughout Europe between 35 and 70°N. In Asia, the distribution stretches from Japan and the Korean peninsula to the Bering Straits.

Its distribution could be said to be circumpolar were it not for the fact that it is absent from the north coast of Siberia, the north coast of Alaska, and the Arctic islands of Canada.

==Variation in morphology and distribution==
Three subspecies are currently recognized by the IUCN:
*&quot;G. a. aculeatus&quot; is found in most of the species range, and is the subspecies most strictly termed the three-spined stickleback; its common name in Britain is the tiddler, although &quot;tittlebat&quot; is also sometimes used.
*&quot;G. a. williamsoni&quot;, the unarmored threespine stickleback, is found only in North America; its recognised range is southern California, though isolated reports have been made of it occurring in British Columbia and Mexico;
*&quot;G. a. santaeannae&quot;, the Santa Ana stickleback, is also restricted to North America.

These subspecies actually represent three examples from the enormous range of morphological variation present within three-spined sticklebacks. Hybrids between some of these morphs show foraging disadvantages, a form of reinforcement in the course of speciation. This is evidence for speciation by reinforcement.

Overall these morphs fall into two rough categories, the anadromous and the freshwater forms:

The anadromous form spends most of its adult life eating plankton and fish in the sea, and returns to freshwater to breed. The adult fish are typically between 6 and 10 cm long, and have 30 to 40 lateral armour plates along their sides. They also have long dorsal and pelvic spines. The anadromous form is morphologically similar all around the Northern Hemisphere, such that anadromous fish from the Baltic, the Atlantic and the Pacific all resemble each other quite closely.

Three-spined stickleback populations are also found in freshwater lakes and streams. These populations were probably formed when anadromous fish started spending their entire lifecycle in fresh water, and thus evolved to live there all year round. Freshwater populations are extremely morphologically diverse, to the extent that many observers (and some taxonomists) would describe a new subspecies of three-spined stickleback in almost every lake in the Northern Hemisphere. One consistent difference between freshwater populations and their anadromous ancestors is the amount of body armour, as the majority of freshwater fish only have between none and 12 lateral armor plates, and shorter dorsal and pelvic spines. However, also large morphological differences occur between lakes. One major axis of variation is between populations found in deep, steep-sided lakes and those in small, shallow lakes. The fish in the deep lakes typically feed in the surface waters on plankton, and often have large eyes, with short, slim bodies and upturned jaws. Some researchers refer to this as the limnetic form. Fish from shallow lakes feed mainly on the lake bed, and are often long and heavy bodied with relatively horizontal jaws and small eyes. These populations are referred to as the benthic form.

Since each watershed was probably colonised separately by anadromous sticklebacks, morphologically similar populations in different watersheds or on different continents are widely believed to have evolved independently. A unique population is found in the meromictic Pink Lake in Gatineau Park, Quebec. Populations have been observed rapidly adapting to different conditions, such as in Lake Union, where sticklebacks have lost and regained armor plates in response to pollution from human activity around the watershed.

One aspect of this morphological variation is that a number of lakes contain both a limnetic and a benthic type, and these do not interbreed with each other. Evolutionary biologists often define species as populations that do not interbreed with each other (the biological species concept), thus the benthics and limnetics within each lake would constitute separate species. These species pairs are an excellent example of how adaptation to different environments (in this case feeding in the surface waters or on the lake bed) can generate new species. This process has come to be termed ecological speciation. This type of species pair is found in British Columbia. The lakes themselves only contain three-spined sticklebacks and cutthroat trout, and all are on islands. Tragically, the pair in Hadley Lake on Lasqueti Island was destroyed in the mid-1980s by the introduction of a predatory catfish, and the pair in Enos Lake on Vancouver Island has started to interbreed and are no longer two distinct species. The two remaining pairs are on Texada Island, in Paxton Lake and Priest Lake, and they are listed as Endangered in the Canadian Species at Risk Act.

Other species pairs which consist of a well-armored marine form and a smaller, unarmored freshwater form are being studied in ponds and lakes in south-central Alaska that were once marine habitats such as those uplifted during the 1964 Alaska earthquake. The evolutionary dynamics of these species pairs are providing a model for the processes of speciation which has taken place in less than 20 years in at least one lake. In 1982, a chemical eradication program intended to make room for trout and salmon at Loberg Lake, Alaska, killed the resident freshwater populations of sticklebacks. Oceanic sticklebacks introduced through nearby Cook Inlet recolonized the lake. In just 12 years beginning in 1990, the frequency of the oceanic form dropped steadily, from 100% to 11%, while a variety with fewer plates increased to 75% of the population, with various intermediate forms making up another small fraction. This rapid evolution is thought to be possible through genetic variations that confer competitive advantages for survival in fresh water when conditions shift rapidly from salt to fresh water. However, the actual molecular basis of this evolution still remains unknown.

Although sticklebacks are found in many locations around the coasts of the Northern Hemisphere and are thus viewed by the IUCN as species of least concern, the unique evolutionary history encapsulated in many freshwater populations indicates further legal protection may be warranted.

==Diet==
In its different forms or stages of life, the three-spined stickleback can be a bottom-feeder (most commonly chironomid larvae and amphipods) or a planktonic feeder in lakes or in the ocean; it can also consume terrestrial prey fallen to the surface. It can cannibalize eggs and fry.

==Life history==

Many populations take two years to mature and experience only one breeding season before dying, and some can take up to three years to reach maturity. However, some freshwater populations and populations at extreme latitudes can reach maturity in only one year.

==Reproduction==

Sexual maturation depends on environmental temperature and photo-period. Longer days and warmer days stimulate brighter colouration in males and the development of eggs in females.

From late April, males and females move from deeper waters to shallow areas. There, each male defends a territory where he builds a nest on the bottom. He starts by digging a small pit. He then fills it with plant material (often filamentous algae), sand, and various debris which he glues together with spiggin, a proteinaceous substance secreted from the kidneys. The word spiggin is derived from &quot;spigg&quot;, the Swedish name for the three-spined stickleback. He then creates a tunnel through the more or less spherical nest by swimming vigorously through it. Nest building typically takes 5–6 hours though it may also be spread out over several days. After this, the male courts gravid females that pass by with a zigzag dance. (In some populations, the male leads the female to the nest, rather than doing the zigzag dance.) He approaches a female by swimming very short distances left and right, and then swims back to the nest in the same way. If the female follows, the male often pokes his head inside the nest, and may swim through the tunnel. The female then swims through the tunnel as well, where she deposits 40–300 eggs. The male follows to fertilize the eggs. The female is then chased away by the male. For the duration of the eggs&#x27; development, the male will chase away other males and non-gravid females. He may, however, court other gravid females (more than one batch of eggs can be deposited in the same nest).

The sequence of territorial courtship and mating behaviours was described in detail by Niko Tinbergen in a landmark early study in ethology. Tinbergen showed that the red colour on the throat of the territorial male acts as a simple sign stimulus, releasing aggression in other males and attracting females. The red colouration may also be used by females as a way to assess male quality. Red colouration is produced from carotenoids found in the diet of the fish. As carotenoids cannot be synthesised &quot;de novo&quot;, the degree of colouration gives an indication of male quality (ability to find food), with higher-quality males showing more intense colouration. Also, males that bear fewer parasites tend to exhibit brighter red colours. Many studies have shown that females prefer males with brighter red colouration. However, the response to red is not universal across the entire species, with black throated populations often found in peat-stained waters.

The male takes care of the developing eggs by fanning them. He lines himself up with the entrance of the nest tunnel and swims on the spot. The movement of his pectoral fins creates a current of water through the nest, bringing fresh (well-oxygenated) water to the eggs. He does this not only during the day, but throughout the night, as well. Fanning levels tend to increase until the eggs are about to hatch, which takes 7–8 days at 18–20 °C. Fanning levels also increase when the water is poorly oxygenated. Towards the end of the egg development phase, the male often makes holes in the roof and near the rim of the nest, presumably to improve ventilation of the nest during fanning at a time when the eggs are more metabolically active. Once the young hatch, the male attempts to keep them together for a few days, sucking up any wanderers into his mouth and spitting them back into the nest. Afterwards, the young disperse and the nest is either abandoned by the male, or repaired in preparation for another breeding cycle.

In Nova Scotia, a form of three-spined stickleback departs from the usual pattern of parental care. Unlike other sticklebacks that nest on the substrate, Nova Scotian male sticklebacks build nests in mats of filamentous algae. Surprisingly, almost immediately after fertilization, the males disperse the eggs from the nest and resume soliciting females for eggs. Hence, there appears to have been a loss of parental care in this population. Because these males have reduced dorsal pigmentation, resulting a pearlescent white appearance, they have been dubbed &quot;white sticklebacks&quot;. It is currently unknown whether they are a distinct species, or simply a morph of the common Atlantic stickleback.

As the breeding cycle of the three-spined stickleback is light and temperature dependent, it is also possible to manipulate breeding in the lab. For example, it is possible to stimulate sticklebacks to breed twice in a calendar year, instead of once, under the right conditions. This can be useful for genetic and behavioural multi-generational studies.

Infection with the cestode parasite &quot;Schistocephalus solidus&quot; can cause a reduction in egg mass or complete absence of eggs in female three-spined sticklebacks.

==Cooperative behavior==
Some evidence indicates the existence of cooperative behavior among three-spined sticklebacks, mainly cooperative predator inspection. Predator inspection appears to allow acquisition of information about the risk a potential predator presents, and may deter attack, with the cost being an increased chance of being attacked if the predator proves to be hungry.

===Tit for tat strategy===
Sticklebacks are known to cooperate in a tit for tat (TFT) strategy when doing predator inspection. The idea behind TFT is that an individual cooperates on the first move and then does whatever its opponent does on the previous move. This allows for a combination of collaborative (it starts by cooperating), retaliatory (punishes defection), and forgiving (respond to cooperation of others, even if they had defected previously) behavioral responses. When three-spined sticklebacks approaching a live predator were provided with either a simulated cooperating companion or a simulated defecting one, the fish behaved according to tit-for-tat strategy, supporting the hypothesis that cooperation can evolve among egoists.

Typically, sticklebacks operate in pairs. Individuals have partners with which they repeatedly perform pairwise predator inspection visits. Two reciprocal pairs per trial occur significantly more often than what was expected due to chance. These results provide further evidence for a tit-for-tat cooperation strategy in sticklebacks.

Stickleback behavior is often cited as an archetypal example of cooperative behavior during predator inspection. Fish from three sites differing in predation risk inspected a model predator in pairs and reciprocated both cooperative moves and defections by the partner, but not on every opportunity. Sticklebacks that originated in the two sites containing piscivorous fish were more likely to reciprocate following a cooperative move than following a defection. Individuals from higher-risk sites were generally more cooperative. Individuals accompanied by a model companion show reciprocal moves of cooperation and defection in response to the model&#x27;s movements about a third of the time. Both examples of stickleback behavior demonstrate the elements of a strategy of cooperation that may resemble tit-for-tat.

===Partner-dependence===

The tit-for-tat cooperation strategy has been shown to be evident in sticklebacks. In addition, the size of a stickleback&#x27;s partner fish may also be a factor in determining what a stickleback will do when both fish are faced with a predator. Two sticklebacks simultaneously presented to a rainbow trout, a predator much larger in size, will have differing risks of being attacked. Usually, the larger of the two sticklebacks has a higher risk of being attacked. Individual sticklebacks are more likely to move closer to a trout (or some other predator) when a larger potential partner moves close to the trout than when a smaller partner approaches the trout. Although both large and small partners behave similarly, a small partner&#x27;s behavior affects the strategy of the test fish more than that of the large partner. Regardless of whether it is alone or with a partner that cooperates, a larger fish will approach a predator more closely than does a smaller fish. If a partner defects, then a stickleback&#x27;s condition-factor (i.e. its ability to flee) determines how closely it approaches the predator rather than the stickleback&#x27;s size. Both the strategy and reaction to different-sized partners seem to be dependent on whether the partner cooperates or defects.

==Parasites==
The three-spined stickleback is a secondary intermediate host for the hermaphroditic parasite &quot;Schistocephalus solidus&quot;, a tapeworm of fish and fish-eating birds. The tapeworm passes into sticklebacks through its first intermediate hosts, cyclopoid copepods, when these are eaten by the fish. The parasite matures into its third larval stage, the plerocercoid, in the abdomen of the stickleback. Infected sticklebacks are afterwards consumed by fish-eating birds, which serve as the tapeworm&#x27;s definitive host.

Another common parasite of the three-spined stickleback is the microsporidian &quot;Glugea anomala&quot;. Naturally infections with &quot;G. anomala&quot; lose weight compared to uninfected individuals, but do not cause size differences between individuals. &quot;Glugea anomala&quot; also correlates behavioural changes, such as increased shoaling, increased sociability and activity, and reduced boldness. It is unknown whether these differences in behaviour are due to certain personality traits predisposing individuals to infections, or whether infections change behaviour.

==Genetics==
Three-spined sticklebacks have recently become a major research organism for evolutionary biologists trying to understand the genetic changes involved in adapting to new environments. The entire genome of a female fish from Bear Paw Lake in Alaska was recently sequenced by the Broad Institute and many other genetic resources are available. This population is under risk from the presence of introduced northern pike in a nearby lake. Three-spined sticklebacks are also used for researching sex-specific brain gene expression. Parents exposed to predator models produced offspring with different gene expressions compared to those that were not exposed to predators. Non-overlapping genes appear highly influenced by the sex of the parent, with genes being differentially expressed in offspring based on whether the male or female parent was exposed to predation.

== Eco-evolutionary dynamics ==

Three-spined stickleback research has been central to the field of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Eco-evolutionary dynamics is an area of study investigating how ecological processes (e.g., population dynamics, community interactions, and nutrient cycling) affect how populations evolve, and in turn, how these patterns of evolution feed back to affect ecological processes. Importantly, these dynamics arise when substantial evolutionary change occurs on the same time scale as ecological change (i.e., less than 1,000 generations). Three-spined stickleback are particularly useful for studying eco-evolutionary dynamics because multiple populations have evolved rapidly and in predictable, repeated patterns after colonizing new environments. These repeated patterns of evolution allow scientists to assess whether the impacts of stickleback evolution on ecological processes are reproducible.

An eco-evolutionary framework has been used to explore multiple aspects of stickleback biology. Notably, this research has focused on how populations of three-spined stickleback have diverged to occupy different ecological niches (a process called adaptive radiation) and how sticklebacks have coevolved with their parasites.

=== Eco-evolutionary dynamics of adaptive radiation ===
Most eco-evolutionary dynamics research in sticklebacks has focused on how the adaptive radiation of different ecotypes affects ecological processes. Ecotypes represent genetically and morphologically recognizable populations occupying distinct ecological niches. In three-spined stickleback, divergent ecotypes are often found as sympatric (i.e., co-occurring) or parapatric (i.e., partially overlapping, but mostly isolated) species pairs, including benthic—limnetic pairs, freshwater—anadromous pairs, and lake—stream pairs. Pairs of stickleback ecotypes have diverged at time scales ranging from 10,000 years to only decades ago.

Different combinations of stickleback ecotypes affect ecosystem processes in different ways. For example, the combined presence of specialized benthic and limnetic sticklebacks has a different effect on the diversity and abundance of prey species compared to the presence of only a generalist ancestral stickleback ecotype. Notably, this effect appears to be driven by limnetic sticklebacks specializing on zooplankton prey, rather than by an increase in the number of co-occurring stickleback species alone. The impacts of ecotype specialization on prey communities can even affect the abundance of algae and cyanobacteria that do not directly interact with sticklebacks, along with aspects of the abiotic environment, such as the amount of ambient light available for photosynthesis and levels of dissolved oxygen, carbon, and phosphorus. These diverse changes in ecosystem processes can persist to affect natural selection on subsequent stickleback generations, potentially shaping how stickleback populations will evolve in the future. Because the presence of specialist verses generalist ecotypes can impact ecosystems in a way that, in turn, affects selection on future stickleback generations, the adaptive radiation of specialized ecotypes could drive eco-evolutionary feedback loops in natural populations.

=== Eco-evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions ===
Sticklebacks have also been studied to investigate the eco-evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite coevolution. Three-spined sticklebacks can be hosts to a variety of parasites (e.g., &quot;Schistocephalus solidus&quot;, a common tapeworm of fish and fish-eating birds). The diversity of parasite species within individual stickleback is influenced by an individual&#x27;s dietary niche and immune response. This covariation between parasite infection and host traits is likely a consequence of eco-evolutionary feedback, whereby the evolution of dietary and parasite resistance traits in sticklebacks alters parasite reproduction and infection rates, which in turn affects parasite exposure and selection on parasite resistance in sticklebacks. These feedbacks can also extend beyond stickleback-parasite interactions to modify ecosystem processes. Specifically, differences in resistance and infection rates among stickleback ecotypes can alter how sticklebacks affect the abundance of prey species and levels of dissolved nutrients and oxygen. These ecosystem impacts can further affect selection on sticklebacks in subsequent generations, which suggests a complex feedback loop between the evolution of host-parasite interactions, community composition, and abiotic conditions.

=== Common methods ===
Many researchers have used mesocosm experiments to test how the adaptive radiation of stickleback ecotypes and stickleback-parasite interactions can impact ecological processes. In these experiments, researchers simulate the natural environments of sticklebacks in enclosed tanks, including natural plant and invertebrate communities and freshwater ecological zones. They then systematically manipulate an independent variable (e.g., which stickleback ecotypes were present or the presence of parasites), and measured differences in biotic and abiotic aspects of ecosystems among the different stickleback treatments. In some cases, researchers have then tested for potential feedback loops between ecotype evolution and ecological change by removing the adult stickleback from the mesocosms and replacing them with juveniles of different ecotypes. By doing so, the researchers could then measure how the effects of adult sticklebacks on their ecosystems influenced overall juvenile fitness (e.g., survival and growth rates) and differences in fitness between juveniles of different ecotypes.

<doc id="489649" wikidata="Q842541" url="?curid=489649" title="HMS Trafalgar (S107)">
<text>HMS &quot;Trafalgar&quot; is a decommissioned of the Royal Navy. Unlike the rest of the &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class boats that followed, she was not launched with a pump-jet propulsion system, but with a conventional 7-bladed propeller. &quot;Trafalgar&quot; was the fifth vessel of the Royal Navy to bear the name, after the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar.

==Operational history==
In 2012 a Royal Navy submariner was jailed for 8 years for trying &quot;to pass secrets to the Russians that could have undermined Britain&#x27;s national security&quot;; one element of this was information on &quot;a secret operation undertaken by HMS &quot;Trafalgar&quot;.

===Combat history===
After Operation Veritas, the attack on Al-Qaeda and Taliban forces following the September 11 attacks in the United States, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; entered Plymouth Sound flying the Jolly Roger on 1 March 2002. She was welcomed back by Admiral Sir Alan West, Commander-in-Chief of the fleet and it emerged she was the first Royal Navy submarine to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles against Afghanistan.

===Grounding incidents===
In July 1996, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; grounded near the Isle of Skye in Scotland.

In November 2002, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; again ran aground close to the Isle of Skye, causing £5 million worth of damage to her hull and injuring three sailors. She was travelling 50 metres below the surface at more than 14 knots when Lieutenant-Commander Tim Green, a student in the &quot;Perisher&quot; course for new submarine commanders, ordered a course change that took her onto the rocks at Fladda-chuain, a small but well-charted islet. Commander Robert Fancy, responsible for navigation, and Commander Ian McGhie, an instructor, both pleaded guilty at court-martial to contributing to the accident. On 9 March 2004 the court reprimanded both for negligence. Green was not prosecuted, but received an administrative censure.

In May 2008 it was reported that the crash was caused by the chart being used in the exercise being covered with tracing paper, to prevent students marking it.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Trafalgar&quot; was decommissioned on 4 December 2009 at Devonport.

<doc id="489650" wikidata="Q3060988" url="?curid=489650" title="HMS Turbulent (S87)">
<text>HMS &quot;Turbulent&quot; is a retired of the Royal Navy and the second vessel of her class. &quot;Turbulent&quot; was the fifth vessel, and second submarine, of the Royal Navy to bear this name. She was built by Vickers Shipbuilding, Barrow-in-Furness, and based at HMNB Devonport. She was commissioned in 1984 and decommissioned in July 2012. She was stripped of equipment and now awaits dismantling in number 3 Basin at Devonport.

Originally intended to hunt down Soviet missile submarines, after the end of the Cold War &quot;Turbulent&quot; spent more time on intelligence gathering missions and landing commando units, as well as firing Tomahawk missiles during the 2003 Iraq war.

==Operational history==
&quot;Turbulent&quot; undertook a modernisation program and first nuclear refuelling in 1997.

===2003 War in Iraq===
&quot;Turbulent&quot; took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, firing thirty Tomahawk cruise missiles during the campaign. On 16 April 2003 she was the first Royal Navy vessel to return home from the war. &quot;Turbulent&quot; arrived in Plymouth flying the Jolly Roger, a tradition in the Royal Navy signifying having fired weapons in anger.

===2011 Military Intervention in Libya===
&quot;Turbulent&quot; left Devonport in February 2011 for a 268-day deployment East of Suez, which was due to be her final before decommissioning. The deployment saw her operating in the Gulf of Sidra relieving HMS &quot;Triumph&quot; as part of the British contribution to the Libya intervention. She was then herself relieved by &quot;Triumph&quot;, before heading through the Suez Canal in June to take up patrol in the Indian Ocean. The boat called into the port of Fujairah, where she rendezvoused with the support ship RFA &quot;Diligence&quot;. &quot;Turbulent&quot; returned to Devonport on 14 December 2011, having spent 190 days of her 267-day deployment underwater and travelling more than 38,000 miles A documentary called &quot;Royal Navy Submarine Mission&quot; on Channel 5 featured &quot;Turbulent&quot; during this 2011 deployment.

During this deployment, just after sailing from Fujairah on 26 May, &quot;Turbulent&quot; suffered a catastrophic failure of her air-conditioning systems, while on the surface. Internal temperatures quickly rose to 60 °C with 100% humidity, and caused 26 casualties, mainly from heat exhaustion, eight of which were life-threatening. With ambient temperatures in the Indian Ocean at 42 °C, surface ventilation was ineffective and the submarine was only effectively cooled by diving to 200 metres. The cause was later found to be blockage of water inlet pipes by barnacles during an extended stay at Fujairah. The incident was only made public in 2014.

===2012 South Atlantic deployment===
&quot;Turbulent&quot; was scheduled to be decommissioned at the end of 2011. In February 2012 it was reported that either &quot;Turbulent&quot; or HMS &quot;Tireless&quot; was being deployed to the Falkland Islands amid increasing tension between Argentina and the United Kingdom over sovereignty of the islands. Commander Nick Wheeler took command in December 2011 until decommissioning on 14 July 2012. She is now being stripped of equipment and will await dismantling in 3 Basin at Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth.

<doc id="489651" wikidata="Q1327349" url="?curid=489651" title="HMS Tireless (S88)">
<text>HMS &quot;Tireless&quot; was the third nuclear submarine of the Royal Navy. &quot;Tireless&quot; is the second submarine of the Royal Navy to bear this name. Launched in March 1984, &quot;Tireless&quot; was sponsored by Sue Squires, wife of Admiral &#x27;Tubby&#x27; Squires, and commissioned in October 1985.

During the Cold War &quot;Tireless&quot; was primarily involved in anti-submarine warfare patrols in the Atlantic Ocean. After the Cold War, &quot;Tireless&quot; was deployed around the world, including to the Arctic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Pacific Ocean. At the end of its career, &quot;Tireless&quot; was involved in the search for the missing airliner, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The vessel experienced a number of serious accidents during its operational life.

&quot;Tireless&quot; had been scheduled for retirement during 2013, but its service was extended until eventual decommissioning on 19 June 2014. &quot;Tireless&quot; was replaced on active duty by HMS &quot;Artful&quot;.

==Operational history==
From commissioning in 1985, &quot;Tireless&quot; completed numerous exercises and visits around the world, including a trip to the Arctic in 1991, before entering a refit in early 1996, returning to sea in 1999.
===Primary coolant leak===
In May 2000, &quot;Tireless&quot; developed a serious leak in the nuclear reactor primary cooling circuit, although there was no leak of radioactive material. The nuclear propulsion system was shut down and using backup diesel power &quot;Tireless&quot; made way to Gibraltar. The damage was found to be more extensive than first thought, and the boat remained there pending repairs. This created diplomatic tension between Spain and Britain, until the submarine departed on 7 May 2001 after almost a year of extensive repairwork. During that year, all s were inspected for similar problems.

===Collision with iceberg===
On 13 May 2003, while on exercise in the Arctic and travelling at a depth of 60 metres, &quot;Tireless&quot; collided with an iceberg. There was no prior warning of the impending collision from passive sonar or other onboard sensors. The submarine&#x27;s bow was forced down nine degrees and the vessel subsequently broke free of the iceberg at a depth of 78 metres. Some damage was sustained to the upper section of the boat. Before the incident, the Royal Navy had not conducted under-ice operations since 1996.

On 19 April 2004, &quot;Tireless&quot; and rendezvoused under the Arctic ice and surfaced together at the North Pole.

&quot;Tireless&quot; again angered Spain in 2004 when the boat put into Gibraltar from 9 to 15 July for what was explained as &quot;technical reasons.&quot; Britain assured Spain that the port call was unrelated to the British celebrations, on 21 July, of the 300th anniversary of Spain handing over Gibraltar to Britain.

=== March 2007 explosion ===
In 2007 &quot;Tireless&quot; ventured to the North Pole with to participate in the Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station (APLIS). On 21 March, two &quot;Tireless&quot; crew members, Leading Weapons Engineer Paul McCann and Weapons Engineer 2 Anthony Huntrod (Weapons Submariner) were killed in an explosion on board, apparently caused by an oxygen generator candle in the forward section of the submarine. The boat was in service near the North Pole under ICEX-07 along with the USS &quot;Alexandria&quot; and had to make an emergency surface through the ice cap. A third crewmember suffered &quot;non life-threatening&quot; injuries and was airlifted to a military hospital at Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska.

According to the Royal Navy, the accident did not affect the submarine&#x27;s nuclear reactor, and the boat sustained only superficial damage. Part of the exercise was being used to measure ice thickness by using sonar. The film &quot;&quot;—which was filming on the ice and in the &quot;Alexandria&quot; during the exercise—was dedicated to McCann and Huntrod.

===2010-2011 deployment===

From 9 July 2010 to 12 May 2011, &quot;Tireless&quot; undertook a ten-month deployment, spending 253 days at sea, the longest conducted by a Royal Navy submarine in ten years. During the deployment the boat passed through the Suez Canal for the first time, provided protection for the French aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; launching aircraft over Afghanistan, and called into the ports of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, Goa in India and Souda Bay in Crete. &quot;Tireless&quot; was also involved in a multi-nation anti-submarine exercise in the Gulf of Oman which saw the Australian frigate HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; and the French frigate FS &quot;Dupleix&quot; attempt to locate the submarine.

===2012 South Atlantic deployment===
In February 2012, it was reported that either &quot;Tireless&quot; or HMS &quot;Turbulent&quot; was being deployed to the Falkland Islands amid increasing tension between Argentina and the United Kingdom over sovereignty of the islands.

However HMS &quot;Tireless&quot; surfaced in Southampton in March, conducting towed array sonar calibration and testing in the Bay of Biscay before returning to Devonport.

===2013 Coolant leak===
In early 2013 &quot;Tireless&quot; experienced a &quot;small coolant leak that was contained within the sealed reactor compartment&quot;, requiring a return to HMNB Devonport for repair.

===2013 Mediterranean deployment===
&quot;Tireless&quot; was spotted off the Rock of Gibraltar amidst the tensions between Spain and the UK over the disputed territory of Gibraltar. It was suggested that this SSN could be a key vessel used to strike Syria if military action occurred.

===2014 Indian Ocean search - Malaysian Airlines flight MH370===
On 1 April 2014, &quot;Tireless&quot; arrived in the southern Indian Ocean to join the search for a missing Malaysian airliner, where its sophisticated underwater listening equipment was used in an unsuccessful attempt to detect the underwater locator beacon of the aircraft&#x27;s flight recorders.

=== Final return to Plymouth ===

On 1 June 2014 &quot;Tireless&quot; returned to Plymouth for the last time before decommissioning, and was formally decommissioned on 19 June.

&quot;Tireless&quot;&#x27; final operations saw visits to Gibraltar, Crete, India, Jordan, the UAE and Australia.

&quot;Tireless&quot; was moved in 2020 to a basin within Devonport dockyard often referred to as “the graveyard”.

<text>Vital Achille Raoul Barré (January 29, 1874 – May 21, 1932) was a Canadian cartoonist, animator of the silent film era, and painter. Initially known as a political cartoonist, he originated the French Canadian comic strip, then crossed over into animated film and started his own studio, a pioneering effort. As a painter, he is considered an Impressionist, evoking atmosphere and light with visible, choppy strokes of paint, whose paintings are in the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec.

==Personal history and career==
Barré was born in Montreal, Quebec, the only artistic child (out of twelve) of a wine merchants and importers. He studied art at the Académie Julian, starting in 1896, and remained there for two years also known as a political cartoonist—he was a loud critic of the unjust trials of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. One of Barré&#x27;s opponents in the war of words and cartoons was Émile Cohl, writing anonymously. On returning to Canada in 1898, he gave birth to the French Canadian comic strip. It was not until 1913 that Barré succeeded in syndicating a newspaper strip in the U.S—&quot;Noahzark Hotel&quot;, a Sunday strip which was distributed by the McClure Syndicate for 11 months. Barré elected not to take credit on the strip, but rather signed it VARB, his initials (Vitale Achille Raoul Barré).

Barré moved to New York City in the United States in 1903. In 1912, Barré saw an animated film that inspired him to go into the industry (perhaps Winsor McCay&#x27;s &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot;). He picked Edison Studios to produce his cartoons and while visiting the studio, met Bill Nolan, a live-action shorts producer who became his business and artistic partner. The two worked together for a year putting out animated and live-action commercials for various companies (quite possibly the first ever use of animation for advertising). It was during this period that the two worked out a system for animating which was radically different from that practiced by anyone else at the time.

Various animators had come up with different methods to keep their drawings lined up, but none of them worked very well. Barré and Nolan&#x27;s solution was to punch two holes at the bottom of all of their sheets and pass them through two pegs glued to the animation table. This peg system is still in practice today. The system they used for animation, on the other hand, was a dead end precisely because it produced registration problems the peg system couldn&#x27;t always fix. The basis of this &quot;slash system&quot; was to tear away the paper being drawn on to show the change underneath. For example, if a character was to move his arm, the first drawing would consist of character and background, then the arm would be carefully torn out to reveal the next sheet down and a new arm was drawn on the new paper revealed. The slash system lasted through the 1920s at various studios before being replaced by Earl Hurd&#x27;s cel animation system.

By 1914, Barré and Nolan felt confident enough to start their own studio, totally independent of Edison and dedicated 100% to animation. This Barré-Nolan Studio was probably the first of its kind (although Bray Productions also had a good claim to the title). The main title produced by the new studio was a series of inserts for the mostly live-action &quot;Animated Grouch Chaser&quot; series, distributed by Edison.

In 1916, William Randolph Hearst, multi-millionaire and newspaper magnate, started a rival animation studio called International Film Service and hired most of Barré&#x27;s animators, including Bill Nolan, by paying them more money than Barré could provide. Barré was reduced to being a contractor for IFS, animating the series &quot;Phables&quot;. After seven cartoons, he quit.

Another man who had stood up to Hearst was Bud Fisher, who had the courts uphold his copyright ownership to his &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; comic strip, which had been printed by Hearst newspapers for nine years. Fisher had turned to independent animator Charles Bowers to turn his strip into a cartoon, but Bowers did not have the facilities to pull this off. Barré had the facilities, but not the men. A partnership was born in the form of Barré-Bowers Studios situated in the Fordham section of The Bronx. Barré did what he could to improve the quality of the animation in his films, investing some of the profits into art classes for the animators (in anticipation of Walt Disney providing such training to his own employees during the 1930s).

&quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; was a strong money-maker for Barré, Bowers, and Fisher, but Barré began to get tired of it all as the years passed, due to personality conflicts with both partners. Barré retired from animation in 1919, amid rumors of a nervous breakdown. He settled into his home in Glen Cove, Long Island, and started selling his oil paintings to the public, as well as some commercial poster work. In the meantime, the surviving partners had a falling out and by 1926 &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; was finished as a film animation property.

In 1925, Barré came to long for the world of animation again, as a replacement for Bill Nolan since he left for the Krazy Kat cartoons. He got what he wanted with the position of &quot;guest animator&quot; for Pat Sullivan Productions working on &quot;Felix the Cat&quot;. The cartoons Barré created for Sullivan are considered the best he ever did, as well as the best Felix cartoons ever made (the chicken antagonist in such cartoons as &quot;Felix Dines and Pines&quot; and &quot;The Oily Bird&quot; was drawn entirely by Barré). Raoul Barré retired from animation the second time in 1927, this time on a high note. Barré spent the last few years of his life drawing oil paintings and political cartoons, while starting his own art school.

He died in Montreal on May 21, 1932, of cancer and was buried in the city&#x27;s Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery.

<doc id="489653" wikidata="Q3024654" url="?curid=489653" title="HMS Torbay (S90)">
<text>HMS &quot;Torbay&quot; is a decommissioned nuclear submarine of the Royal Navy and the fourth vessel of her class. &quot;Torbay&quot; was the fifth vessel and the second submarine of the Royal Navy to be named after Torbay in Devon, England. The first vessel was the 80-gun second rate HMS &quot;Torbay&quot; launched in 1693.

She was the first vessel to be fitted with the new command system SMCS NG.

&quot;Torbay&quot; was scheduled to be decommissioned in 2015, to be replaced by one of the new Astute-class submarines. she was undergoing extended maintenance and upgrades. The work allowed for a two-year life extension beyond the previously-planned decommissioning date. On 6 June 2017, she entered Gibraltar Naval Base flying her paying-off pennant and, on Friday 14 July 2017, the vessel was decommissioned in Devonport.

==Operational history==
&quot;Torbay&quot; completed a refuel and modernisation process in February 2001.

In early 2006, &quot;Torbay&quot; was the participant in an experiment in the use of colour schemes to reduce the visibility of submarines from the air. The standard black paint of Royal Navy submarines was replaced by a carefully selected shade of blue. This was the result of research that found that black was the worst possible colour for a submarine attempting to avoid detection from the air. This change is in part the result of the changing nature of Royal Navy commitments since the end of the Cold War, with Navy operations moving from the murky waters of the North Atlantic to the clearer waters of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.

In November 2010, it was reported in Hansard that &quot;Torbay&quot; had run aground in the Eastern Mediterranean in April 2009.

In May 2011, she took part in Exercise Saxon Warrior in the Western Approaches. The exercise included the aircraft carrier , HMS &quot;Dauntless&quot;, HMS &quot;Westminster&quot;, and a number of other vessels and culminated in a &quot;Thursday War&quot;.

In late 2011 she entered a revalidation and assisted maintenance period (RAMP) at Devonport Royal Dockyard. This includes communications upgrades with installation of the Cromwell radio antenna to enhance internal communications and the ship alongside upgrade, plus inspection of the hull and reactor, an overhaul of one of the reactor coolers and upgrades to many other systems. the RAMP was 85% complete, with a return to service originally planned for summer 2013.

In 2013, there was a fire on board.

She made her final entry to Devonport on 19 June 2017 prior to her formal decommissioning parade on 14 July 2017.

<text>HMS &quot;Trenchant&quot; was a nuclear-powered fleet submarine of the Royal Navy built by Vickers Shipbuilding, Barrow-in-Furness. &quot;Trenchant&quot; was based at HMNB Devonport. She was the third vessel and the second submarine of the Royal Navy to be named for the characteristic of vigour and incisiveness.

The submarine was ordered on 22 March 1983. She was laid down by Vickers Shipbuilding on 28 October 1985, and was launched on 3 November 1986 in the presence of Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Hezlet, who had commanded the World War II T-class submarine . She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 14 January 1989.

Following the Integrated Review of 2020, &quot;Trenchant&quot; left active service in 2021 and formally decommissioned in May 2022.

==Operational history==

===1990–1999===
On 22 November 1990, the nets of the trawler were snagged by &quot;Trenchant&quot; in the Bute Sound in Scotland. At the time the submarine was conducting a &#x27;Perisher&#x27; Submarine Command Course exercise in company with the frigate . &quot;Antares&quot; was pulled under with the loss of all four members of the crew. A subsequent Marine Accident Investigation found that the accident had been caused by &quot;a partial breakdown in both the structure and the standards of watchkeeping on board &quot;Trenchant&quot;&quot;.

In July 1997, the submarine ran aground off the western coast of Australia. While approaching Fremantle, Western Australia, the submarine remained at a depth of and grounded when she made contact with the continental shelf, coming to rest on a sloping patch of seafloor. &quot;Trenchant&quot; was able to free herself, and an inspection by divers reported no significant damage.

&quot;Trenchant&quot; tested the non-hull-penetrating optronic mast in 1998. She also trialled a camouflage paint scheme comprising jagged shapes of various colours, including pale blue.

===2000–2022===

On 21 June 2007, the submarine became the first Royal Navy vessel to fire the new Block IV Tomahawk cruise missile in a live-firing trial in the Gulf of Mexico off the United States coast.

In late 2009, &quot;Trenchant&quot; entered the Devonport submarine refit complex to undertake a 2-year refit and upgrade programme. Upon completion of the programme, the submarine underwent a rededication service on 6 June 2011 to welcome the boat back to active service.

On 22 May 2013, &quot;Trenchant&quot; completed the longest patrol ever carried out by a Royal Navy SSN. The patrol lasted 335 days (11 months) during which the submarine sailed . During this time the vessel visited six different ports: Fujairah, UAE; the British Indian Ocean Territory – Diego Garcia; the Kingdom of Bahrain; Aqaba, Jordan; Souda Bay, Crete; and Gibraltar.

Following a maintenance period involving a weapon and sensors upgrade, &quot;Trenchant&quot; returned to service in August 2016.

In March 2018, &quot;Trenchant&quot;, along with the American submarines and , participated in ICEX 2018, surfacing through the Arctic ice. This was the first time a Royal Navy submarine participated in ICEX since 2007.

In April 2020 a Royal Navy investigation was opened into videos of sailors having a party while under lockdown. The submarine had returned to Devonport for repairs and the crew were required to stay on board in isolation while repairs were completed because of COVID-19 restrictions. It was confirmed that some sailors were drinking alcohol and it was reported that the captain had approved the party despite being advised that it might be inappropriate. The captain was sent home and later relieved of his command, and moved to another role within the Navy.

&quot;Trenchant&quot;″s final four-month deployment in the Atlantic was filmed for a Channel 5 television documentary called &quot;Submarine: Life Beneath the Waves&quot;, which was first shown in the United Kingdom in September 2021. On 25 March 2021 she sailed into Plymouth for the last time, flying her decommissioning pennant, ahead of decommissioning later.

&quot;Trenchant&quot; was decommissioned in a joint ceremony with on 20 May 2022 in the presence of the Princess Royal.

<text>HMS &quot;Talent&quot; is the sixth of seven nuclear submarines operated by the Royal Navy from 1990 until 2022. It was built at Barrow-in-Furness.

==Name==
&quot;Talent&quot; is the third submarine of the Royal Navy to bear the name. The first was a T-class submarine that was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy as before launching in 1943. The second, was also a T-class submarine, launched in 1945 and operated by the Royal Navy until 1966.

==Operational history==
&quot;Talent&quot; was launched by The Princess Royal in April 1988, and commissioned in May 1990.

&quot;Talent&quot; entered HMNB Devonport, its homeport, for a refit, rejoining the active fleet in March 2007 following a £386 million upgrade. This included a new reactor core, and updated sonar suite: Sonar 2076.

In 2009, &quot;Talent&quot; suffered loss of primary and alternative power supplies to its nuclear reactors while in dock.

On 6 August 2013, &quot;Talent&quot; returned to Plymouth after a 3-month deployment. In October 2013, the submarine conducted an anti-submarine exercise with , , and .

In April 2015, it was reported that &quot;Talent&quot; had struck ice at some point in 2014 while tracking Russian vessels.

&quot;Talent&quot; moved from Devonport to HMNB Clyde in July 2019.

Although originally scheduled for decommissioning in 2021, the slow delivery of the &quot;Astute&quot;-class boats meant that &quot;Talent&quot; was retained in service for at least an additional 12 months, with a planned out of service date extended to the end of 2022.

Under the terms of the 2021 Integrated Review, &quot;Talent&quot; was scheduled to be decommissioned by the end of 2022, to be replaced by , the fifth
. In April 2022, it was reported that &quot;Talent&quot; was being prepared for disposal and the submarine was decommissioned in a joint ceremony with on 20 May 2022, in the presence of the Princess Royal.

==Affiliations== 
The boat was affiliated with the town of Shrewsbury in Shropshire, and while commissioned, its crew enjoyed Freedom of the Town.

The submarine&#x27;s sponsor was the Princess Royal, who presided over its launch in 1988 and its decommissioning ceremony in 2022.

<doc id="489666" wikidata="Q1380058" url="?curid=489666" title="Kalki Krishnamurthy">
<text>Ramaswamy Krishnamurthy (9 September 1899 – 5 December 1954), better known by his pen name Kalki, was an Indian writer, journalist, poet, critic and Indian independence activist who wrote in Tamil. He chose the pen-name &quot;Kalki&quot;, the future incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu. He founded a magazine, which was also named &quot;Kalki&quot;, with T Sadasivam being the co-founder, in 1941. Krishnamurthy‘s writings include over 120 short stories, 10 novellas, 5 novels, 3 historical romances, editorial and political writings and hundreds of film and music reviews.

==Early life==
Ramaswamy Krishnamurthy was born in a poor Tamil Brahmin family on 9 September 1899 in Puthamangalam, near Manalmedu, in Mayiladuthurai district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Krishnamurthy&#x27;s father was Ramaswamy Aiyar, an accountant in Puttamangalam village in the old Tanjore district of erstwhile Madras Presidency. He began his primary education in his village school and later attended Municipal High School in Mayavaram but quit in 1921, just short of completion of his Senior School Leaving Certificate, in response to Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s 1921 call for non-co-operation joining the Indian National Congress instead.

His son Kalki Rajendran was married to Sadasivam&#x27;s daughter Vijaya. Krishnamurthy&#x27;s daughter Anandi was married to Sadasivam&#x27;s nephew (sister&#x27;s son) Ramachandran, known as Ambi in music circles. Anandi&#x27;s daughter Gowri Ramanarayanan was a music critic for &quot;The Hindu&quot; newspaper, and she also learned music under M S Subbulakshmi.

==Literary work==
Krishnamurthy started writing fiction stories in &quot;Navaskthi&quot; in 1923 where he worked as a sub editor. He was working under the tutelage of Thiru Vi Ka when he published his first book in 1927. He started working with C Rajagopalachari in Thiruchengode in Gandhi Ashram. He published &quot;Vimochanam&quot; along with &quot;Rajaji&quot;, a journal propagating liquor prohibition. He was working in freedom struggle and during 1931, he was jailed for six months. He joined &quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot;, a popular Tamil magazine along with editor S S Vasan. He became very popular as a critic, witty author, political commentator and short story writer. He wrote under various pen names like &quot;Kalki&quot;, &quot;Ra. Ki&quot;, &quot;Tamil Theni&quot; and &quot;Karnatkam&quot;. He left &quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot; and joined freedom struggle in 1941. On his release, he and Sadasivam started a weekly named &quot;Kalki&quot;. He was the editor in the journal till his death on 5 December 1954.

<doc id="489670" wikidata="Q835173" url="?curid=489670" title="Law of agency">
<text>The law of agency is an area of commercial law dealing with a set of contractual, quasi-contractual and non-contractual fiduciary relationships that involve a person, called the agent, who is authorized to act on behalf of another (called the principal) to create legal relations with a third party. It may be referred to as the equal relationship between a principal and an agent whereby the principal, expressly or implicitly, authorizes the agent to work under their control and on their behalf. The agent is, thus, required to negotiate on behalf of the principal or bring them and third parties into contractual relationship. This branch of law separates and regulates the relationships between:
* agents and principals (internal relationship), known as the principal-agent relationship;
* agents and the third parties with whom they deal on their principals&#x27; behalf (external relationship); and
* principals and the third parties when the agents deal.

== Concepts ==

The reciprocal rights and liabilities between a principal and an agent reflect commercial and legal realities. A business owner often relies on an employee or another person to conduct a business. In the case of a corporation, since a corporation can only act through natural person agents, the principal is bound by the contract entered into by the agent, so long as the agent performs within the scope of the agency.

A third party may rely in good faith on the representation by a person who identifies himself as an agent for another. It is not always cost effective to check whether someone who is represented as having the authority to act for another actually has such authority. If it is subsequently found that the alleged agent was acting without necessary authority, the agent will generally be held liable.

== Scope of agency ==

The role of an agent and scope of their authority affect how the agent is described. For example,

# Universal agents are authorized to perform all lawful acts that the principal could personally perform.
# General agents are authorized to transact all of the principal&#x27;s business in a particular place or of a particular kind, for example, as a partner in business; and
# Special agents are authorized to perform either a specific transaction or task.

== Authority ==

An agent who acts within the scope of authority conferred by their principal binds the principal in the obligations they create against third parties. There are essentially three kinds of authority recognized in the law: actual authority (whether express or implied), apparent authority, and ratified authority.

=== Actual authority ===
Actual authority can be of two kinds. Either the principal may have expressly conferred authority on the agent, or authority may be implied. Authority arises by consensual agreement, and whether it exists is a question of fact. An agent, as a general rule, is only entitled to indemnity from the principal if they have acted within the scope of their actual authority, and if they act outside of that authority they may be in breach of contract, and liable to a third party for breach of the implied warranty of authority.

==== Express actual authority ====
Express actual authority means an agent has been expressly told they may act on behalf of a principal.

==== Implied actual authority ====
Implied actual authority, also called &quot;usual authority&quot;, is authority an agent has by virtue of being reasonably necessary to carry out his express authority. As such, it can be inferred by virtue of a position held by an agent. For example, partners have authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several, and in a corporation, all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their position have authority to bind the corporation.
Other forms of implied actual authority include customary authority. This is where customs of a trade imply the agent to have certain powers. In wool buying industries it is customary for traders to purchase in their own names.
Also incidental authority, where an agent is supposed to have any authority to complete other tasks which are necessary and incidental to completing the express actual authority. This must be no more than necessary

=== Apparent authority ===

Apparent authority (also called &quot;ostensible authority&quot;) exists where the principal&#x27;s words or conduct would lead a reasonable person in the third party&#x27;s position to believe that the agent was authorized to act, even if the principal and the purported agent had never discussed such a relationship. For example, where one person appoints a person to a position which carries with it agency-like powers, those who know of the appointment are entitled to assume that there is apparent authority to do the things ordinarily entrusted to one occupying such a position. If a principal creates the impression that an agent is authorized but there is no actual authority, third parties are protected so long as they have acted reasonably. This is sometimes termed &quot;agency by estoppel&quot; or the &quot;doctrine of holding out&quot;, where the principal will be estopped from denying the grant of authority if third parties have changed their positions to their detriment in reliance on the representations made.
* &quot;Rama Corporation Ltd v Proved Tin and General Investments Ltd&quot; [1952] 2 QB 147, Slade J, &quot;Ostensible or apparent authority... is merely a form of estoppel, indeed, it has been termed agency by estoppel and you cannot call in aid an estoppel unless you have three ingredients: (i) a representation, (ii) reliance on the representation, and (iii) an alteration of your position resulting from such reliance.&quot;

==== &quot;Watteau v Fenwick&quot; in the UK ====

In the case of &quot;Watteau v Fenwick&quot;, Lord Coleridge CJ on the Queen&#x27;s Bench concurred with an opinion by Wills J that a third party could hold personally liable a principal who he did not know about when he sold cigars to an agent that was acting outside of its authority. Wills J held that &quot;the principal is liable for all the acts of the agent which are within the authority usually confided to an agent of that character, notwithstanding limitations, as between the principal and the agent, put upon that authority.&quot; This decision is heavily criticised and doubted, though not entirely overruled in the UK. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;usual authority&quot; (though not in the sense used by Lord Denning MR in &quot;Hely-Hutchinson&quot;, where it is synonymous with &quot;implied actual authority&quot;). It has been explained as a form of apparent authority, or &quot;inherent agency power&quot;.

Authority by virtue of a position held to deter fraud and other harms that may befall individuals dealing with agents, there is a concept of Inherent Agency power, which is power derived solely by virtue of the agency relation. For example, partners have apparent authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several (see below), and in a corporation, all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their declared position have apparent authority to bind the corporation.

Even if the agent does act without authority, the principal may ratify the transaction and accept liability on the transactions as negotiated. This may be express or implied from the principal&#x27;s behavior, e.g. if the agent has purported to act in a number of situations and the principal has knowingly acquiesced, the failure to notify all concerned of the agent&#x27;s lack of authority is an implied ratification to those transactions and an implied grant of authority for future transactions of a similar nature.

== Liability ==

=== Liability of agent to third party ===

If the agent has actual or apparent authority, the agent will not be liable for acts performed within the scope of such authority, as long as the relationship of the agency and the identity of the principal have been disclosed. When the agency is undisclosed or partially disclosed, however, both the agent and the principal are liable. Where the principal is not bound because the agent has no actual or apparent authority, the purported agent is liable to the third party for breach of the implied warranty of authority.

=== Liability of agent to principal ===

If the agent has acted without actual authority, but the principal is nevertheless bound because the agent had apparent authority, the agent is liable to indemnify the principal for any resulting loss or damage.

=== Liability of principal to agent ===

If the agent has acted within the scope of the actual authority given, the principal must indemnify the agent for payments made during the course of the relationship whether the expenditure was expressly authorized or merely necessary in promoting the principal&#x27;s business.

== Duties ==

An agent owes the principal a number of duties. These include:
* a duty to undertake the task or tasks specified by the terms of the agency;
* a duty to discharge his duties with care and due diligence;

An agent must not accept any new obligations that are inconsistent with the duties owed to the principal. An agent can represent the interests of more than one principal, conflicting or potentially conflicting, only after full disclosure and consent of the principal. An agent must not usurp an opportunity from the principal by taking it for himself or passing it on to a third party.

In return, the principal must make a full disclosure of all information relevant to the transactions that the agent is authorized to negotiate.

== Termination ==

The internal agency relationship may be dissolved by agreement. Under sections 201 to 210 of the Indian Contract Act 1872, an agency may come to an end in a variety of ways:

# Withdrawal by the agent – however, the principal cannot revoke an agency coupled with interest to the prejudice of such interest. An agency is coupled with interest when the agent himself has an interest in the subject-matter of the agency, e.g., where the goods are consigned by an upcountry constituent to a commission agent for sale, with poor to recoup himself from the sale proceeds, the advances made by him to the principal against the security of the goods; in such a case, the principal cannot revoke the agent&#x27;s authority till the goods are actually sold and debts satisfied, nor is the agency terminated by death or insanity (illustrations to s. 201);
# By the agent renouncing the business of agency;
# By discharge of the contractual agency obligations.

Alternatively, agency may be terminated by operation of law:
# By the death of either party;
# By the insanity of either party;
# By the bankruptcy (insolvency) of either party;

The principal also cannot revoke the agent&#x27;s authority after it has been partly exercised, so as to bind the principal (s. 204), though he can always do so, before such authority has been so exercised (s. 203). Further, under s. 205, if the agency is for a fixed period, the principal cannot terminate the agency before the time expired, except for sufficient cause. If he does, he is liable to compensate the agent for the loss caused to him thereby. The same rules apply where the agent, renounces an agency for a fixed period. Notice in this connection that want of skill, continuous disobedience of lawful orders, and rude or insulting behavior has been held to be sufficient cause for dismissal of an agent. Further, reasonable notice has to be given by one party to the other; otherwise, damage resulting from want of such notice, will have to be paid (s. 206). Under s. 207, the revocation or renunciation of an agency may be made expressly or implicitly by conduct. The termination does not take effect as regards the agent, till it becomes known to him and as regards third party, till the termination is known to them (s. 208).

When an agent&#x27;s authority is terminated, it operates as a termination of subagent also (s. 210).

== Partnerships and companies ==
This has become a more difficult area as states are not consistent on the nature of a partnership. Some states opt for the partnership as no more than an aggregate of the natural persons who have joined the firm. Others treat the partnership as a business entity and, like a corporation, vest the partnership with a separate legal personality. Hence, for example, in English law a partner is the agent of the other partners, whereas in Scots law &quot;a [partnership] is a legal person distinct from the partners of whom it is composed&quot; and so a partner is the agent of the partnership &quot;per se&quot;. This form of agency is inherent in the status of a partner and does not arise out of a contract of agency with a principal. The Partnership Act 1890 of the United Kingdom (which includes both England and Scotland) provides that a partner who acts within the scope of his actual authority (express or implied) will bind the partnership when he does anything in the ordinary course of carrying on partnership business. Even if that implied authority has been revoked or limited, the partner will have apparent authority unless the third party knows that the authority has been compromised. Hence, if the partnership wishes to limit any partner&#x27;s authority, it must give express notice of the limitation to the world. However, there would be little substantive difference if English law was amended: partners will bind the partnership rather than their fellow partners individually. For these purposes, the knowledge of the partner acting will be imputed to the other partners, or to the firm if a separate personality. The other partners or the firm are the principal and third parties are entitled to assume that the principal has been informed of all relevant information. This causes problems when one partner acts fraudulently or negligently and causes loss to clients of the firm. In most states, a distinction is drawn between knowledge of the firm&#x27;s general business activities and the confidential affairs as they affect one client. Thus, there is no imputation if the partner is acting against the interests of the firm as a fraud. There is more likely to be liability in tort if the partnership benefited by receiving fee income for the work negligently performed, even if only as an aspect of the standard provisions of vicarious liability. Whether the injured party wishes to sue the partnership or the individual partners is usually a matter for the plaintiff since, in most jurisdictions, their liability is joint and several.

== Agency relationships ==
Agency relationships are common in many professional areas.
* employment.
* financial advice (insurance agency, stock brokerage, accountancy)
* contract negotiation and promotion (business management) such as for publishing, fashion model, music, movies, theatre, show business, and sport.

An &quot;agent&quot; in commercial law (also referred to as a &quot;manager&quot;) is a person who is authorized to act on behalf of another (called the &quot;principal&quot; or &quot;client&quot;) to create a legal relationship with a third party.

A legal entity may also act as an agent: For example, two corporate groups may assign the task of intermediating an M&amp;A transaction to a business agency, that acts as a 3rd party, in order to finalize the deal. This happens for example when you move over an entity to an intermediary holding company, before settling it into its final destination entity.

=== Agency relationship in a real estate transaction ===
Real estate transactions refer to real estate brokerage, and mortgage brokerage. In real estate brokerage, the buyers or sellers are the principals themselves and the broker or his salesperson who represents each principal is his agent.

== Applications in jurisdictions ==

=== In English law ===

Agency law in the United Kingdom is a component of UK commercial law, and forms a core set of rules necessary for the smooth functioning of business. Agency law is primarily governed by the Common law and to a lesser extent by statutory instruments.

In 1986, the European Communities enacted Directive 86/653/EEC on self-employed commercial agents. In the UK, this was implemented into national law in the Commercial Agents Regulations 1993. Thus, agent and principals in a commercial agency relationship are subject both to the Common law and the Commercial Agents Regulations.

The Commercial Agents Regulations require agents to act “dutifully and in good faith” in performing their activities (Reg. 3); co-extensively, principals are required principals to act “dutifully and in good faith” in their “relations” with their commercial agents (Reg 4). Though there is no statutory definition of this obligation to act “dutifully and in good faith”, it has been suggested that it requires principals and agents to act &quot;with honesty, openness and regard for the interests of the other party to the transaction&quot;. Two &quot;normative precepts&quot; assist in concretising this standard of conduct:

&quot;Firstly, expressing honesty and openness, commercial agents and principals must mutually co-operate in the performance of their agreement. Conduct in good faith requires that each party proactively take action to assist the other in the realisation of their bargain, as opposed to mere abstention from obstructive behaviour. However, whether a party has acted in good faith must not be determined by reference to a moral or metaphysical notion of co-operation; this assessment must be based on an objective appraisal of the actual commercial agency relationship. Accordingly, the intensity of the required co-operation will vary, depending on the terms of the contract and the pertinent commercial practices.

Secondly, commercial agents and principals must not exploit asymmetries in their agency relationship in such a manner that frustrates the legitimate expectations of the other party. In this respect, whether a conduct is in breach of the Obligation must be appraised holistically, considering all aspects of the relationship; material facts will include the contractual and commercial leverage of each party, their objective intentions as enshrined in the contract, and the business practices of the sector in question. Nevertheless, the starting axiom of this investigation must be that these are commercial relationships in which professionals are expected to be self-reliant and must be free to pursue their self-interest. Critically, this will not be an estimation aimed at achieving ontological fairness, a just bargain or equilibrium between the giving and receiving of commercial agents and principals&quot;.

===In Irish law===
In Ireland, Directive 86/653/EEC was implemented in the Commercial Agents Regulations of 1994 and 1997.

===India===
In India, for the purposes of contractual law, section 182 of the Contract Act 1872 defines agent as “a person employed to do any act for another or to represent another in dealings with third persons”.

According to section 184 as between the principal and third persons, any person (whether he has contractual capacity or not) may become an agent. Thus, a minor or a person of unsound mind can also become an agent.

==Allograph==
An allograph may be the opposite of an autograph – i.e. a person&#x27;s words or name (signature) written by someone else. In law, an allograph is a writing or signature made by an agent on behalf of a principal. In American law, checks written by an agent of behalf of, and with the authority of, a principal are allographs for that principal.

<text>A government agency or state agency, sometimes an appointed commission, is a permanent or semi-permanent organization in the machinery of government (bureaucracy) that is responsible for the oversight and administration of specific functions, such as an administration. There is a notable variety of agency types. Although usage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a department or ministry, and other types of public body established by government. The functions of an agency are normally executive in character since different types of organizations (&quot;such as commissions&quot;) are most often constituted in an advisory role — this distinction is often blurred in practice however, it is not allowed.

A government agency may be established by either a national government or a state government within a federal system. Agencies can be established by legislation or by executive powers. The autonomy, independence, and accountability of government agencies also vary widely.

==History==
Early examples of organizations that would now be termed a government agency include the British Navy Board, responsible for ships and supplies, which was established in 1546 by King Henry VIII and the British Commissioners of Bankruptcy established in 1570.

From 1933, the New Deal saw growth in U.S. federal agencies, the &quot;alphabet agencies&quot; as they were used to deliver new programs created by legislation, such as the Federal Emergency Relief Administration.

From the 1980s, as part of New Public Management, several countries including Australia and the United Kingdom developed the use of agencies to improve efficiency in public services.

== By country ==
=== Australia ===
=== Canada ===
=== France ===
Administrative law in France refers to &quot;autorité administrative indépendante&quot; (AAI) or Independent Administrative Authorities. They tend to be prominent in the following areas of public policy;

* Economic and financial regulation
* Information and communication
* Defence of citizens&#x27; rights

Independent Administrative Authorities in France may not be instructed or ordered to take specific actions by the government.

=== Germany ===
=== Greece ===
The General Secretariat for Macedonia and Thrace (Greek: Γενική Γραμματεία Μακεδονίας-Θράκης), previously Ministry for Macedonia and Thrace (Greek: Υπουργείο Μακεδονίας-Θράκης) is a government agency of the Hellenic Republic that is responsible for the Greek regions of Macedonia and Thrace.

=== Iceland ===
=== India ===
The term &quot;agency&quot; in India has several meanings; for example, the Cabinet and the parliament describes itself as a &quot;&quot;nodal agency&quot; for coordination amongst the ministries of the Govt. of India&quot;. Most notably as an international feature, what appear to be independent agencies (&quot;or apex agencies&quot;) include some that have active roles for Ministers: such as, the National Security Council, the Medical Council of India, the Pharmacy Council of India (PCI), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and the NITI Aayog, which is chaired ex officio by the Prime Minister.

=== Russia ===
Russia has had many government agencies throughout its history. The USSR had the secretive KGB.
Today, Russian government agencies such as the FSB, FSO, and the GRU use Spetsnaz or other masked operators for any missions.
Other organizations include Kremlin and presidential security.

=== Sweden ===
The Government agencies in Sweden are State controlled organizations who act independently to carry out the policies of the Government of Sweden. The Ministries are relatively small and merely policy-making organizations, allowed to control agencies by policy decisions but not by direct orders. This means that while the agencies are subject to decisions made by the Government, Ministers are explicitly prohibited (so-called ban on &quot;ministerstyre&quot;) from interfering with the day-to-day operation in an agency or the outcome in individual cases as well.

In addition to the State and its agencies, there are also local government agencies, which are extensions of municipalities and county councils.

=== United Kingdom ===
Agencies in the United Kingdom are either executive agencies answerable to government ministers or non-departmental public bodies answerable directly to parliament or the devolved assemblies of the United Kingdom. They are also commonly known as Quangos.

Agencies can be created by enabling legislation by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Parliament.

=== United States ===
The Congress and President of the United States delegate specific authority to government agencies to regulate the complex facets of the modern American federal state. Also, most of the 50 U.S. states have created similar government agencies. Each state government is similar to the national government, with all but one having a bicameral legislature.
The term &quot;government agency&quot; or &quot;administrative agency&quot; usually applies to one of the independent agencies of the United States government, which exercise some degree of independence from the President&#x27;s control. Although the heads of independent agencies are often appointed by the government, they can usually be removed only for cause. The heads of independent agencies work together in groups, such as a commission, board or council. Independent agencies often function as miniature versions of the tripartite federal government with the authority to legislate (through the issuing or promulgation of regulations), to adjudicate disputes, and to enforce agency regulations. Examples of independent agencies include the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

A broader definition of the term &quot;government agency&quot; also means the United States federal executive departments that include the President&#x27;s cabinet-level departments and their sub-units. Examples of these include the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which is a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

Most federal agencies are created by Congress through statutes called &quot;enabling acts&quot;, which define the scope of an agency&#x27;s authority. Because the Constitution does not expressly mention federal agencies (as it does the three branches), some commentators have called agencies the &quot;headless fourth branch&quot; of the federal government. However, most independent agencies are technically part of the executive branch, with a few located in the legislative branch of government. By enacting the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in 1946, Congress established some means to oversee government agency action. The APA established uniform administrative law procedures for a federal agency&#x27;s promulgation of rules and adjudication of claims. The APA also sets forth the process for judicial review of agency action.

<text>is a Japanese baseball-themed manga series written and illustrated by Mitsuru Adachi. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from July 1992 to November 1999, with its chapters collected in thirty-four &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. It was adapted into an anime television series and a television drama series, &quot;H2: Kimi to Ita Hibi&quot;, directed by Yukihiko Tsutsumi.

In August 2018, the manga series had over 55 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series.

==Synopsis==
During middle school, Hiro Kunimi (pitcher), Hideo Tachibana (third baseman and 4th batter), and Atsushi Noda (catcher) were friends and teammates on the same baseball team. Thanks to their skills, their school achieved an unbeaten record on their way to consecutive national championships.

In the seventh grade Hiro also played matchmaker to Hideo and Hikari Amamiya, a neighborhood childhood friend who grew up with him as close as a sibling. At this time Hiro, victim of a delayed growth spurt, was a very short, comparatively immature boy, uninterested in girls, and initially happy that he could get the two of them together. Eventually Hiro realized that he too had feelings for Hikari and, once he grew up, Hikari also realized that her affection for Hiro might be something more than sisterly.

As the manga begins Hiro is dealing with a doctor&#x27;s diagnosis that tells him that, if he continues pitching, his elbow would shatter within three months. Likewise, Noda is diagnosed with a severe back injury by the same doctor, seemingly ending their dreams of Kōshien. Because of this, Hiro and Noda choose to go to Senkawa High School, which lacks a baseball team; Hiro instead joins the soccer team and Noda, the swim team. Their friends, Hikari and Hideo, attend Meiwa Daiichi High School, which boasts one of the top-ranked high school baseball teams in the country.

While Senkawa does not have an official baseball team they do have a baseball &quot;fan club,&quot; voluntarily managed by the cute but klutzy Haruka Koga, a girl Hiro keeps running into- literally. While a member of the soccer team, Hiro is drawn into a practice baseball game between the soccer team and Haruka&#x27;s fan club. Disgusted by the demeaning behavior of his team captain and the pompous 1st year star player, Ryūtaro Kine, (once an accomplished Little League pitcher), Hiro decides to switch sides and pitch &quot;one last game&quot; for the fan club. Joined by Noda, they very nearly come from behind and overcome the soccer team&#x27;s large advantage in just a couple innings, but do succeed in rallying the demoralized fan club and embarrassing the soccer team.

Soon after it is revealed that the doctor who diagnosed Hiro and Noda was actually a quack and they have no lasting injuries, meaning they can return to playing baseball. Instead of transferring to Meiwa Daiichi or another school with a baseball team they decide to accept their fate and, with the help of the fan club and Haruka, persuade their &quot;baseball-hating&quot; headmaster to establish a proper baseball team. They succeed in this by playing Meiwa Daiichi in a practice game they were not expected to do well in. Although Senkawa ultimately loses the game by a single run (because a Meiwa Daiichi umpire lies about a call to give them the win), the game rekindles the headmaster&#x27;s former love of baseball and he allows the club to be formed.

Led by novice coach Fujio Koga, Haruka&#x27;s brother, the team plays their first game as an official team against the Northern Tokyo Division&#x27;s leading team, Eikyo High School, in what is supposed to be a friendly practice match. Although Eikyo easily wins, the game and stories about the team reveal that the veteran coach and the famed first-year pitcher Hirota share a ruthless &quot;win-by-any-means&quot; game philosophy that includes purposefully injuring rival players and shunning players that do not obey them, no matter how skilled they are.

In their second year, the new baseball club gains three notable members: Sagawa, Shima, and Ohtake. Sagawa is an old friend of Hideo&#x27;s who also has a reputation as a one-time delinquent, and the latter two are relatives of Hirota, planted by him to destroy Senkawa from within at his command. All eventually grow used to the friendly atmosphere of the Senkawa team and prove to be extremely valuable team members. In the final game of the divisional tournament Senkawa defeats Eikyo, advancing to the National Koshien Tournament, vindicating their style of play and specifically Coach Koga and Sagawa, who were separately both previous victims of the Eikyo coach and Hirota.

Senkawa were set to meet up with Meiwa Daiichi after two opponents in the Koshien tournament, a duel between the friends and rivals: Hiro and Hideo. This is foiled when Senkawa loses in the ninth inning of the second round when Hiro sprains his foot while dodging the opposing pitcher&#x27;s hand, which was tagging first base directly under his spiked cleats. Meiwa Daiichi went on to win this Summer Tournament.

Around this time Hiro admits to Hikari that he fell in love with her in the eighth grade and still feels strongly for her. Yet at the same time he is also struggling with his feeling for Haruka and does tell her &quot;I love you&quot; after a situation in which he defends her from a fellow student who tried to force himself on her. Although they are much closer after this it is not certain they are officially dating.

Meiwa Daiichi fail to win their division in the Fall tournament, after the departure of their third year players, and are not invited to the Spring invitational Koshien. This leads to Hiro and Senkawa winning the national Spring tournament without facing them.

Between the Spring and Summer tournaments a passing Hikari luckily saves the life of Hiro&#x27;s mother, whom she found on the floor suffering from an acute appendicitis, but soon after loses her own mother to a sudden and unexplained illness. This devastates both Hikari and Hiro, who loved her as a second mother. Hikari is greatly comforted by a very attentive Hideo but only cries with Hiro.

Right before their last summer tournament starts Hideo tells Hikari that she must choose between him and Hiro once they face each other in what he believes is their fated showdown at Koshien. Sure enough, Senkawa and Meiwa Daiichi both advance to meet in the semi-final match. Hiro only learns that Hideo made this ultimatum to her the night before the game. Hiro keeps Hideo hitless through three at bats and protects a Senkawa 2-0 lead as he faces Hideo for a final showdown with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. Hideo very nearly hits a home run but it goes barely foul due to a brief gust of wind in the stadium. On the final pitch, Hideo momentarily second-guesses which pitch Hiro is throwing and strikes out, ending the game. As Senkawa celebrates their victory, tears fall from Hiro&#x27;s eyes, but also from Hikari&#x27;s eyes as she watches from the stands.

That night, Hideo talks with Hikari and admits his defeat to Hiro but she tells him that she never had the right to choose between them. Hideo then tells her that the loss made him realize that he needs Hikari more than anyone else. They embrace. The next morning, Hiro implies to Haruka that he intends to play baseball as a professional by tossing a paper airplane that he says is &quot;traveling to the major leagues&quot; and Haruka declares her decision to accompany him by saying &quot;then I will be the stewardess,&quot; referencing an earlier conversation where she said she wanted to become a stewardess, which she sees as a fitting job for the wife of a baseball player.

Having resolved the real conflicts of the story, the manga ends with Senkawa traveling in their bus to play the final game of the Koshien, never revealing if they win or not.

==Characters==
:
:Hiro initially escaped to Senkawa in order to forget baseball. After his elbow was properly diagnosed, he strove to strengthen the newly created Senkawa baseball team as its star pitcher. Although he&#x27;s blessed with a huge amount of talent since childhood, he&#x27;s also hard-working and passionate about the sport. This combination results in one of the most monstruous pitchers ever created in the world of fiction. He&#x27;s a fearsome batter(the third batter of Senkawa&#x27;s line-up for most of the series) and a first-class fielder. Kunimi also displays inhuman amounts of stamina and focus(during his first Koshien game in the manga, Hideo states that &quot;He could pitch 18 innings and even then get a no-hitter&quot;). Although he throws a great fastball(152km/h by the end of the series, possibly greater - it hit 157km/h in the drama), he has less control over his forkballs. However, since his failed forkballs turn out to be fastballs, it leads to a degree of unpredictability in his pitches. He has also developed a high-speed slider that may only be caught by a professional level catcher. Hiro was responsible for introducing Hikari to Hideo. He has belated romantic feelings for his childhood friend, Hikari Amamiya, and starts to also develop feelings for Senkawa&#x27;s manager, Koga Haruka.
:
:Hiro&#x27;s best friend and greatest rival in baseball, they were in the same baseball team in middle school. Hideo has been dating Hikari since middle school, and aims to enter the professional baseball leagues after he graduates from high school. Like Hiro, he&#x27;s a natural-born genius when it comes to baseball, but that doesn&#x27;t stop him from working very hard to become even better. A fantastic batter, he becomes the clean-up hitter for Meiwa Daiichi High as a first-year, quickly becoming a national star after that. There&#x27;s a scene in the manga where Meiwa&#x27;s coach states that &quot;Letting Hideo face off against high-school pitchers with an aluminium bat in his hands is almost cheating&quot;. That only goes to show how skilled Hideo is as a batter.
:
:Hiro&#x27;s childhood friend and Hideo&#x27;s girlfriend, Hikari dreams of becoming a journalist. She is a member of the archery club, but has once come in as a temporary manager for Meiwa Daiichi&#x27;s baseball team during the Koshien by Hideo&#x27;s request. Although she seems happy with Hideo, she seems to have feelings for Hiro as well.
:
:Daughter to the businessman whom Hiro&#x27;s father works for, she was a high school baseball enthusiast. A hardworking baseball club manager, she played an instrumental role in creating and supporting Senkawa&#x27;s baseball club. As time goes along, her feelings for Hiro grow more apparent. She dreams of being an air flight stewardess as well as a professional baseballer&#x27;s wife.
:
:The catcher that makes up Senkawa&#x27;s battery, Noda is the third person in the friendship of Hideo and Hiro. Fat and lazy, Hiro still acknowledges that Noda is a good catcher:able to make decisions about fielding and understanding the general condition of the team. Likes to joke around a lot and make bad puns, but it&#x27;s actually a wise and clever person, becoming the captain of Senkawa&#x27;s baseball team as a sophomore. Noda is Senkawa&#x27;s clean-up hitter, and although his performance is inconsistent, he&#x27;s a great batter with a good balance of strength and timing.
:
:Used to play for the Hakusan Angels in primary school until Hideo replaced him. He turned to soccer instead, his athletic ability helping him. He tries to persuade Haruka to give up on her baseball ambitions, but later joins the baseball team in order to get closer with Haruka. Kine acts as leadoff batter and center fielder, and was also pitcher when he was in the Hakusan Angels. As a homage to Kakefu, he does left-handed baseball swings. As Haruka and Hiro&#x27;s relationship gets better, he plots with Miho in order to split them up. Often used as comic relief by Adachi, he&#x27;s also portrayed as a good player with a great baseball sense(and a lot of luck). Likes to brag, but also works pretty hard when motivated. Kine is also the best center fielder shown in the series.
:One of the managers for Meiwa Daiichi, she joined in order to get closer to Hideo. However, she fails in this due to Hideo&#x27;s loyalty to Hikari. She attempts to break them up, but continually fails. She later plots with Kine in order to break up Hideo and Hikari. Their plotting results in both Miho and Kine getting closer.

==Baseball teams==
;Senkawa
:Coached by Fujio Koga, Haruka&#x27;s brother, the Senkawa team was newly created. However, the presence of Hiro, Atsushi, Yanagi and Kine soon proved that Senkawa was a threat to be considered. In Hiro&#x27;s second year of high school, 3 notable players joined Senkawa: the fast Osamu, the boxer Ootake, and the shortstop Sagawa Shuuji, a friend of Hideo. In Hiro&#x27;s third and last highschool year, several well acknowledged first-year players joined Senkawa, but none were focused on explicitly.
;Meiwa Daiichi
:Hideo and Hikari&#x27;s school, Hideo is the star player. Miho is one of the managers of the team, but Hikari sat as manager during the team&#x27;s Koshien games although she was just a temporary manager. The coach is understanding, and gets along well with Hideo.
;Eikyo
: Eikyo&#x27;s star pitcher, Hirota, is considered one of the best pitchers in the Koshien with his 142 km/h left-handed fastballs. With the backing of the calculative Coach Shiroyama, they were considered serious contenders for the Koshien. Hirota aimed to get to the pros. However, Shiroyama&#x27;s calculative strategy kept their best catcher, Oogura on the bench.
;Iba Shogyo
:The star pitcher, Kohei Tsukigata, and the star hitter, Jin Shimizu, are both fans of Hiro and Hideo respectively. Tsukigata&#x27;s pitches, and his curveball in particular, are extremely well controlled, and he had the potential to be considered a genius if he had started training early. They defeated Senkawa in the Koshien tournament as Hiro was willing to sacrifice his own leg in order to not hurt Tsukigata&#x27;s hand.

<text>The 3rd Division () was a unit of the Finnish Army during the Continuation War. It initially fought in the northern Finland, participating in the Finno-German Operation Arctic Fox. In 1944, it was transferred to the Karelian Isthmus to defend against the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive. Following the Moscow Armistice in 1944, the division was moved to Oulu and participated in the Lapland War.

==History==
The 3rd Division was the main component of the Finnish III Corps. During the war, the division fought mostly in the Ukhta and Kestenga area, where it participated in Operation Arctic Fox, the Finno-German drive towards the Murmansk railway. During this operation, the division was split into two groups, Group J () and Group F (). Observing the speed of advance of the III Corps, the Germans reinforced Group J with a regiment-sized element of SS-troops. The division&#x27;s advance was eventually halted after the Soviet 88th Rifle Division entered the area.

In 1944 the division was transferred to the Karelian Isthmus, where it participated in the Finnish defense against the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive. During this time, the division was temporarily reinforced with the 6th Separate Battalion (). Formed originally by the Germans as 664th Eastern Battalion, the battalion consisted of volunteering, non-prisoner-of-war, Ingrian Finns.

Following the Moscow Armistice in 1944, the division was moved to Oulu. As part of the Lapland War against Germany, the division&#x27;s Infantry Regiment 11 conducted a landing in Tornio in the morning of October 1st, 1944. Following a successful landing, the regiment was reinforced the next day by Infantry Regiment 53, also from the 3rd Division. From Tornio, the division advanced to Rovaniemi and onward to Muonio where it was disbanded.

<text>Ultraviolet is a 1998 British television series written and directed by Joe Ahearne and starring Jack Davenport, Susannah Harker, Idris Elba, and Philip Quast. The music was composed and performed by Sue Hewitt. The programme was produced by World Productions for Channel 4.

==Synopsis==
In the near future, threats to stability like global warming, has caused vampires to attempt covert domination of the earth. Detective Sergeant Michael Colefield (Jack Davenport) discovers that his best friend Jack (Stephen Moyer) has gone missing on the night before his wedding. Investigating Jack&#x27;s disappearance leads Michael into the path of a secret paramilitary vampire-hunting organization supported by the British government and the Vatican. Michael learns that Jack has become a vampire. Michael remains devoted to his friend and abhors the brutal methods used by the organization&#x27;s agents – including Vaughn Rice (Idris Elba) – until he realizes that Jack is lying about his situation and that the vampire hunters are correct in their assessment of the vampires. He allows himself to be recruited by the organization, but he hopes to find a middle ground.

Over the course of the series, Michael and the organization investigate vampire-related activity, often involving medical experimentation. Individual cases involve a woman who may be pregnant with a vampire fetus, a vampire test subject with synthetic blood, and the outbreak of a disease related to vampirism. The vampires are organized, and appear to be moving toward a common goal; the organization must determine what their agenda is. Living and working in the shadows takes a personal toll on the organization&#x27;s agents: Michael&#x27;s relationship with Jack&#x27;s fiancée (Colette Brown) is threatened by his need to hide the truth from her; Angie Marsh (Susannah Harker) must come to terms with the loss of her husband, who was killed by the organization after becoming a vampire; Fr. Pearse Harman (Philip Quast) is diagnosed with terminal cancer, but fears that leaving his post may doom the world to whatever fate the vampires have in store for it.

The final episode reveals that the vampires&#x27; plan does not involve enslaving humanity as suspected. Instead, they plan to cause a nuclear winter, providing long-lasting darkness, and completely wiping out the threat of humanity with an engineered plague. Scientific advances made during their experiments will allow them to survive on synthetic blood and reproduce via live birth, eliminating the need for human victims.

==Characters==

===Main characters===

* Michael Colefield (played by Jack Davenport)
The protagonist of the series, Michael is a Detective Sergeant at the beginning of the series with the Metropolitan Police; he is close friends and partners with his colleague Jack in CID and is due to be the best man at his wedding. One of Michael&#x27;s main informants, Pollard, is shot dead by a vampire in the first episode and this coupled with Jack&#x27;s disappearance and subsequent transformation into a vampire is the catalyst for him joining Section V. Over the course of the series, Michael must deal with balancing both the job and his personal life—he is attracted to Jack&#x27;s fiance Kirsty but does not want to endanger her further.

* Dr Angela Marsh (played by Susannah Harker)
A cancer specialist and the team&#x27;s resident doctor and lead scientist, Angie Marsh became involved in the organisation when her husband Robert, a prominent medical researcher, and her daughter were turned into vampires and killed by Pearse. Angie has remained extremely wary of allowing her remaining daughter, aged 11, any contact outside of home and restricts her movements outside of school. In the fifth episode of the series, she meets a vampire acquaintance of her deceased husband who tells her that he never stopped loving her, even after his death.

* Vaughan Rice (played by Idris Elba)
The organisation&#x27;s main security lead, Vaughan Rice was the sole survivor of a squad of Gulf War soldiers who had been turned by vampires trying to study the effects of Gulf War Syndrome. Discharged with post-traumatic stress disorder, he was quickly recruited into the organisation to help eliminate the vampire infection. Vaughan shows very little emotion in his role, frequently referring to the vampires as &#x27;leeches&#x27; and not hesitating to kill anyone who he suspects has been infected. In the fifth episode of the series, he is abducted and placed in a sealed garage with four coffins timed to open and only barely escapes with his life when he causes one to explode and break open the door.

* Pearse J. Harman (played by Philip Quast)
The leader of the organisation and a priest, Pearse has a droll and cynical personality but also provides occasional black humour to lighten the gravity of the situation. In the third episode of the series he starts to display the symptoms of cancer, which is later formally diagnosed by Angie. Despite his illness he continues to work, desperate to learn the secrets of vampire regeneration which are finally revealed in the last episode of the series.

===Supporting characters===
* Kirsty (played by Colette Brown)
Jack&#x27;s fiance whom she is due to marry in the first episode, Kirsty remains oblivious to Jack&#x27;s fate until the final episode of the series. Throughout the series she is keen to discover the truth about Jack, first from Michael who covers up what has really happened and then with a journalist who eventually becomes a vampire himself.

* Frances (played by Fiona Dolman)
Michael&#x27;s former girlfriend and main contact on the outside. She has access to highly privileged information through her work (never specified in the series), which she often passes on to him. Michael&#x27;s secretiveness about his new job, his focus on Kirsty, and his repeated demands for Frances&#x27;s help eventually cause friction in their relationship. In the finale, Pearce is forced to demonstrate the existence of vampires to her to persuade her to cooperate with Section V.

* Jacob (played by Thomas Lockyer)
A journalist whom Kirsty enlists to help find Michael after the latter disappears. He later becomes a vampire and entangles Kirsty in his plan to get to Michael and Section V.

==Style and themes==

The show attempted a modern and scientific approach to vampires. It eschewed much of the supernatural elements of vampire lore. The word &quot;vampire&quot; is never spoken in the show. The formal term for the antagonists is &quot;Code Fives&quot;, derived from the Roman numeral for five, V, which is also the first letter in &quot;vampire&quot;. A slang term used is &quot;leeches&quot;. The clandestine vampire-hunting squad uses overwhelming numbers and modern &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; versions of traditional anti-vampire weapons: carbon bullets instead of wooden stakes; gas grenades with concentrated allicin, a compound derived from garlic; and video cameras as sights on firearms since vampires are as invisible to electronic devices as mirrors.

A prominent theme in the show is the emotional and social toll that the main characters&#x27; knowledge causes them. After joining the squad, Michael feels he must distance himself from his former friends in order to protect them. Angie March comments at one point that she&#x27;s &quot;getting a reputation as an anti-social parent&quot; because she won&#x27;t let her daughter attend social functions after dark. Vaughn Rice is in love with Angie, but cannot bring himself to tell her due to the stress of their job. At several points in the show, both Michael and a captured vampire question whether the team&#x27;s methods are justified.

==Vampirism as depicted in the series==

Vampires in the series are depicted as ageless and immortal. They are stronger and faster than normal humans, to the extent that a physical encounter between a human and vampire will almost always be fatal for the human. Vampires lack most of the supernatural powers attributed to them in folklore, such as turning into bats, mist or wolves. The folkloric lack of a reflection is extended in the series: vampires are invisible to electronic devices. They cannot be imaged by video cameras, and cannot be recorded on videotape or film. Their voices cannot be transmitted electronically and ink will not hold an impression of their fingerprints. Vampire DNA is invisible under an electron microscope. Vampires use voice synthesis software to communicate via telephone. They use cars with blacked-out windows in order to move outside during the day, and time-locked coffins for long-distance travel.

==Episode titles==
# &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot;
# &quot;In Nomine Patris&quot;
# &quot;Sub Judice&quot;
# &quot;Mea Culpa&quot;
# &quot;Terra Incognita&quot;
# &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2000, the American Fox network developed a version of &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, starring Eric Thal, Joanna Going and Mädchen Amick with Idris Elba reprising his role from the British series. The American version did not progress beyond an unaired pilot episode. Howard Gordon, one of the producers contracted to develop the series, said in an interview that &quot;we screwed it up and it just didn&#x27;t come out that well&quot;. The original UK version has been screened by the Sci-Fi Channel in the US. It was shown originally as a three-part miniseries (each part being two of the original episodes shown consecutively) and during some later airings all six episodes were shown in a marathon format.

<doc id="489707" wikidata="Q2115578" url="?curid=489707" title="Hasse principle">
<text>In mathematics, Helmut Hasse&#x27;s local–global principle, also known as the Hasse principle, is the idea that one can find an integer solution to an equation by using the Chinese remainder theorem to piece together solutions modulo powers of each different prime number. This is handled by examining the equation in the completions of the rational numbers: the real numbers and the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers. A more formal version of the Hasse principle states that certain types of equations have a rational solution if and only if they have a solution in the real numbers &quot;and&quot; in the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers for each prime &quot;p&quot;.

==Intuition==
Given a polynomial equation with rational coefficients, if it has a rational solution, then this also yields a real solution and a &quot;p&quot;-adic solution, as the rationals embed in the reals and &quot;p&quot;-adics: a global solution yields local solutions at each prime. The Hasse principle asks when the reverse can be done, or rather, asks what the obstruction is: when can you patch together solutions over the reals and &quot;p&quot;-adics to yield a solution over the rationals: when can local solutions be joined to form a global solution?

One can ask this for other rings or fields: integers, for instance, or number fields. For number fields, rather than reals and &quot;p&quot;-adics, one uses complex embeddings and formula_1-adics, for prime ideals formula_1.

==Forms representing 0==
===Quadratic forms===
The Hasse–Minkowski theorem states that the local–global principle holds for the problem of representing 0 by quadratic forms over the rational numbers (which is Minkowski&#x27;s result); and more generally over any number field (as proved by Hasse), when one uses all the appropriate local field necessary conditions. Hasse&#x27;s theorem on cyclic extensions states that the local–global principle applies to the condition of being a relative norm for a cyclic extension of number fields.

===Cubic forms===
A counterexample by Ernst S. Selmer shows that the Hasse–Minkowski theorem cannot be extended to forms of degree 3: The cubic equation 3&quot;x&quot;3 + 4&quot;y&quot;3 + 5&quot;z&quot;3 = 0 has a solution in real numbers, and in all p-adic fields, but it has no nontrivial solution in which &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; are all rational numbers.

Roger Heath-Brown showed that every cubic form over the integers in at least 14 variables represents 0, improving on earlier results of Davenport. Since every cubic form over the p-adic numbers with at least ten variables represents 0, the local–global principle holds trivially for cubic forms over the rationals in at least 14 variables.

Restricting to non-singular forms, one can do better than this: Heath-Brown proved that every non-singular cubic form over the rational numbers in at least 10 variables represents 0, thus trivially establishing the Hasse principle for this class of forms. It is known that Heath-Brown&#x27;s result is best possible in the sense that there exist non-singular cubic forms over the rationals in 9 variables that do not represent zero. However, Hooley showed that the Hasse principle holds for the representation of 0 by non-singular cubic forms over the rational numbers in at least nine variables. Davenport, Heath-Brown and Hooley all used the Hardy–Littlewood circle method in their proofs. According to an idea of Manin, the obstructions to the Hasse principle holding for cubic forms can be tied into the theory of the Brauer group; this is the Brauer–Manin obstruction, which accounts completely for the failure of the Hasse principle for some classes of variety. However, Skorobogatov has shown that the Brauer–Manin obstruction cannot explain all the failures of the Hasse principle.

===Forms of higher degree===
Counterexamples by Fujiwara and Sudo show that the Hasse–Minkowski theorem is not extensible to forms of degree 10&quot;n&quot; + 5, where &quot;n&quot; is a non-negative integer.

On the other hand, Birch&#x27;s theorem shows that if &quot;d&quot; is any odd natural number, then there is a number &quot;N&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) such that any form of degree &quot;d&quot; in more than &quot;N&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) variables represents 0: the Hasse principle holds trivially.

==Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem==
The Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem establishes a local–global principle for the splitting of a central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; over an algebraic number field &quot;K&quot;. It states that if &quot;A&quot; splits over every completion &quot;K&quot;&quot;v&quot; then it is isomorphic to a matrix algebra over &quot;K&quot;.

==Hasse principle for algebraic groups==

The Hasse principle for algebraic groups states that if &quot;G&quot; is a simply-connected algebraic group defined over the global field &quot;k&quot; then the map
:formula_3
is injective, where the product is over all places &quot;s&quot; of &quot;k&quot;.

The Hasse principle for orthogonal groups is closely related to the Hasse principle for the corresponding quadratic forms.

 and several others verified the Hasse principle by case-by-case proofs for each group. The last case was the group &quot;E&quot;8 which was only completed by many years after the other cases.

The Hasse principle for algebraic groups was used in the proofs of the Weil conjecture for Tamagawa numbers and the strong approximation theorem.

<text>Two major operate in Tokyo: Tokyo Metro and the Toei Subway. Most of the network is located in the 23 special wards, with portions extending into Chiba and Saitama Prefectures. The subways are one part of Greater Tokyo&#x27;s passenger rail network, with through service further connecting the subway to suburban railways in Western Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture.

==Networks==
There are two primary subway operators in Tokyo:

* Tokyo Metro – Formerly a statutory corporation called the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA), it was converted into a &quot;kabushiki gaisha&quot; (joint-stock company) in 2004. It currently operates 180 stations on nine lines and of route.
* Toei Subway – run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, an agency of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. It operates 106 stations on four lines and of route.

, the combined subway network of the Tokyo and Toei metros comprises 286 stations and 13 lines covering a total system length of . The Tokyo Metro and Toei networks together carry a combined average of over eight million passengers daily. Despite being ranked second overall in worldwide subway usage (after the Shanghai Metro) as of 2019, subways make up a relatively small fraction of heavy rail rapid transit in Tokyo alone—only 286 out of 938 railway stations, as of 2020. The Tokyo subway at 8.7 million daily passengers only represents 22% of Tokyo&#x27;s 40 million daily rail passengers (see Transport in Greater Tokyo). Other urban commuter rail systems include Keikyu Corporation (formerly the Keihin Electric Express Railway), Keio Corporation, Keisei Electric Railway, Odakyu Electric Railway, Seibu Railway, Tobu Railway and Tokyu Corporation.

In addition, but not formally designated as subways:

* The Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit (TWR) operates a single mostly-underground line with eight stations, and 200,200 daily passengers in 2010.
* The Saitama Rapid Railway Line, which is essentially an extension of the Tokyo Metro Namboku Line, operates a single mostly-underground line with eight stations.
* The Tōyō Rapid Railway Line, which is essentially an extension of the Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line, operates a single underground/elevated line with nine stations.
* The Yamanote Line and Chūō Line (Rapid) are not subway lines, but a surface commuter loop line (Yamanote Line) and a cross-city line that operate with metro-like frequencies. They are owned by JR East, act as key transportation arteries in central Tokyo, and are often marked on Tokyo subway maps.

The Yokohama Subway and the Minatomirai Line also operate in the Greater Tokyo Area, but they are not directly connected to the Tokyo subway network. However, direct through services from the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line regularly run into Yokohama&#x27;s Minatomirai Line via the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line.

==History==

* 1915: Japan&#x27;s first underground railway opens under Tokyo Station. It is only for the railway post office, not for passengers.
* 1927: opens Japan&#x27;s first underground line of the subway Ginza Line on 30 December 1927, publicizing it as &quot;the first underground railway in the Orient.&quot; The distance of the line is only 2.2 km between Ueno and Asakusa.
* 1938: opens its subway system between Aoyama 6-chome (present-day Omotesando) and Toranomon.
* 1939: Tokyo Rapid Transit Railway extends its line from Toranomon to Shimbashi, and starts an reciprocal operation with Tokyo Underground Railway.
* 1941: During World War II, the two subway companies merge under the name by the local government.
* 1954: The Marunouchi Line, the first subway line after World War II, opens between Ikebukuro and Ochanomizu.
* 1960: Toei Subway Line 1, present-day Toei Asakusa Line, opens between Oshiage and Asakusa.
* 1968: Toei Subway Line 6 (currently the Toei Mita Line) opens between Shimura Station (renamed Takashimadaira Station in 1969) and Sugamo Station.
* 1991: The Tokyo Metro Namboku Line opens.
* 1995: On 20 March, the Tokyo subway sarin attack occurs on the Marunouchi, Hibiya, and Chiyoda Lines during the morning rush hour. Over 5,000 people are injured and 13 people are killed. All three lines cease operation for the whole day.
* 2000: The Namboku Line opens between Tameike-sanno Station and Meguro Station and the Toei Mita Line opens between Mita Station and Meguro Station, with both lines sharing infrastructure between Meguro Station and Shirokane-takanawa Station. Additionally, both lines start through service with the Tokyu Meguro Line.
* 2004: Teito Rapid Transit Authority is privatized and renamed Tokyo Metro Co., Ltd.
* 2008: The Fukutoshin Line opens.
* 2013: The Fukutoshin Line starts through service with the Tokyu Toyoko Line.
* 2023: The Toei Mita Line, the Namboku Line, and the Fukutoshin Line start through service with the Tōkyū Shin-Yokohama Line, the Sōtetsu Shin-Yokohama Line, the Sōtetsu Main Line and the Izumino Line via the Tokyu Meguro Line (Toei Mita Line and Namboku Line) and the Tokyu Toyoko Line (Fukutoshin Line).

==System administration==
Both the Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway systems are closely integrated with a unified system of line colors, line codes, and station numbers. However, the separate administration of metro systems has some ramifications:

* For single rides across Metro and Toei systems, a special transfer ticket is required. It costs 70 yen less than the sum of the Metro fare and the Toei fare, calculated based on the shortest possible route between the origin and destination stations. The system simplified such ticketing problems, by allowing one stored-fare card to be used on most of the rail operators in the Greater Tokyo Area (with the noticeable exception of JR East which continued to use its own Suica system). The new Pasmo system was introduced in 2007 and completely replaced the Passnet in 2008, finally allowing for one unified stored fare system for most of the Tokyo transit system, including JR East. The fare charged by the stored fare system may be slightly less than for users of paper tickets, as fares are calculated in ¥1 increments on stored fare cards whereas paper tickets are calculated at ¥10 increments.
* The systems represent the metro network differently in station, train, and customer information diagrams. For example, the Toei map represents the Toei Ōedo Line as a circle in the centre, whereas the Tokyo Metro&#x27;s map saves the central ring line for the Marunouchi Line and the JR Yamanote Line. As well, each system&#x27;s lines are generally rendered with thicker lines on their respective system maps.

==Reciprocal operation==
As is common with Japanese subway systems, many above-ground and underground lines in the Greater Tokyo Area operate through services with the Tokyo Metro and Toei lines. Through services operate on all lines except Tokyo Metro Ginza and Marunouchi Lines and Toei Oedo Line. In a broader sense they are considered a part of the Tokyo subway network, allowing it to reach farther out into the suburbs.

<text>Burnham Beeches is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest situated west of Farnham Common in the village of Burnham, Buckinghamshire. The southern half is owned by the Corporation of London and is open to the public. It is also a National Nature Reserve and a Special Area of Conservation.

Burnham Beeches came into ownership of the City of London Corporation after the land came up for auction in 1879. The auction followed the death of the land owner who had permitted public access. Its special status was recognised and discussed in the House of Commons. The land failed to sell at the auction. Subsequently Sir Henry Peek purchased the land at the reserve price £12,000. Sir Henry Peek sold to the City of London Corporation (£6,000), retaining the &quot;enclosed&quot; portion of the land of . Purchase was funded from duties levied on grain landed at the Port of London. Money was also spent on roads to improve access (estimated cost £500), one of these is named after Sir Henry. At this time local authorities were encouraged to provide open spaces with public access to provide some relief from polluted towns and cities. (Summarised from Hansard and various contemporary newspaper reports.)

==Preservation==

The largely beech woodland has been regularly pollarded, with many trees now several hundred years old. Their age, and the amount of deadwood in and around them, means that the woodland is rich in wildlife. More than sixty of the species of plants and animals here are either rare or under threat nationally. The area is protected as a National Nature Reserve, Site of Special Scientific Interest and a candidate Special Area of Conservation.

==Archaeology==
Seven Ways Plain hill fort is located in the south west part of Burnham Beeches. It is a rare example of a single rampart earthwork used either as a stock enclosures or possibly places of refuge. It comprises a range of earthworks which have been dated to the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. It is a Scheduled Monument.

==Filming==
The close proximity of Pinewood, Shepperton and Bray Studios and the outstanding natural beauty of the Beeches have made it a desirable filming location. &quot;Robin Hood Prince of Thieves&quot;, &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, &quot;First Knight&quot;, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, the 1952 Disney film &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Horrible Histories: The Movie&quot;, and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;State of Decay&quot; are some of the films and TV productions that have been shot at Burnham Beeches.

Filming is tightly controlled in recognition of the Beeches&#x27; international importance for wildlife. Filming is restricted to no more than twenty days per year and to certain times of year. Filming in environmentally sensitive areas has also been banned. Revenue from filming goes directly to fund the upkeep and management of the Beeches.

==Affiliates==
Burnham, New Zealand, was named after the village of Burnham.

Burnham Beeches F.C. are an amateur football team who currently compete in the East Berkshire Football League.

<text>The Kansas Turnpike is a controlled-access toll road that lies entirely within the US state of Kansas. It runs in a general southwest–northeast direction from the Oklahoma border to Kansas City. It passes through several major Kansas cities, including Wichita, Topeka, and Lawrence. The turnpike is owned and maintained by the Kansas Turnpike Authority (KTA), which is headquartered in Wichita.

The Kansas Turnpike was built from 1954 to 1956, predating the Interstate Highway System. While not part of the system&#x27;s early plans, the turnpike was eventually incorporated into the Interstate System in late 1956 and is designated today as four different Interstate Highway routes: Interstate 35 (I-35), Interstate 335 (I-335), I-470, and I-70. The turnpike also carries a piece of two U.S. Highways: U.S. Highway 24 (US-24) and US-40 in Kansas City.

Because it predates the Interstate Highway System, the road is not engineered to current Interstate Highway standards and notably lacks a regulation-width median. To reduce the risk of head-on collisions, the Kansas Turnpike now has a continuous, permanent Jersey barrier in the median over its entire length. On opening, there was no fixed speed limit on the highway; drivers were merely asked to keep to a &quot;reasonable and proper&quot; limit, although, shortly afterward, signs were erected in certain stretches indicating a maximum speed of . From 1970 to 1974 and again since 2011, the turnpike&#x27;s speed limit has been set at ; that limit during the earlier period applied only during daytime hours.

Around 120,000 drivers use the turnpike daily. The road features numerous services, including a travel radio station and six service areas. One of these service areas is notable for the presence of a memorial to University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, who died near the current highway&#x27;s route. 

Since July 1, 2024, toll collection on the Kansas Turnpike has been all-electronic, with all tolls payable with a K-TAG transponder or via license plate recognition. The turnpike is self-sustaining; it derives its entire revenue from the tolls collected and requires no additional tax money for maintenance or administration.

==History==

===Early history===
Early federal plans for a nationwide system of interregional highways did not include a route along or near the present turnpike, instead connecting Oklahoma City and Kansas City via southeastern Kansas and US-69. By the mid-1940s, this route had shifted to roughly the present I-35 alignment, serving Wichita. The only major difference from the present route was between Wichita and Emporia, where the highway ran north to Newton before turning northeast along US-50.

In the early 1950s, toll roads were gaining in popularity as a mechanism for funding new superhighways. This trend started with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940, which was mimicked by other toll roads in New York, New Jersey, several New England states, West Virginia, Ohio, and Colorado. In October 1951, the Highway Council of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce researched the possibility of integrating the state into a potential cross-country turnpike system. Eastern Kansas was also included in an interstate turnpike system stretching from Galveston, Texas, to Saint Louis, Missouri, via Kansas City, that was proposed by Oklahoma Governor Johnston Murray. Many firms from construction industries, as well as those concerned about the state&#x27;s economic development, worked to have legislation passed to allow the turnpike to be constructed. Governor Ed Arn and Gale Moss, the State Highway Director, were two major proponents of the turnpike concept.

The turnpike idea was an attractive one because initial construction was to be financed by the private sector via sales of revenue bonds, allowing state highway funds to be used for other important projects. The new toll road would also reduce traffic, and thus maintenance costs, on existing roads. There was also a concern that if Kansas lagged behind in turnpike construction, it might be bypassed by toll roads in other states, leaving it at an economic disadvantage. The toll concept also had the benefit of ultimately putting the financial burden on the drivers who actually used the road, instead of using tax revenue that had been collected from residents statewide. There was some opposition to the plan from both government officials and citizens due to concerns that the toll revenue might not cover the repayments to investors, bankrupting the turnpike authority and burdening the state government with the remaining debt. There were also worries about the possibility of the turnpike requiring maintenance before the bonds had been repaid. Some critics also felt that the high speeds typical of turnpike driving were unsafe. As right-of-way for the project was obtained, the turnpike drew additional opposition from farmers and ranchers, who objected to the turnpike bisecting their property, making it difficult to access disjointed parcels of land.

The Kansas Chamber of Commerce held &quot;turnpike clinics&quot; in several locations across Kansas in 1952, reporting an overwhelmingly positive reception from the public. The Kansas Turnpike Act, defining a turnpike from Oklahoma to Kansas City, became effective April 7, 1953. It created the KTA, with Gale Moss selected as its first chairman. With a budget of only $25,000 (equivalent to $ in ), the KTA&#x27;s first office was a former barbershop in the Kansas State Capitol.

Given Oklahoma&#x27;s plans to build a turnpike north from Oklahoma City to the Kansas state line, and taking into account traffic flow maps prepared by the highway department, a preliminary route was chosen connecting the proposed Oklahoma turnpike to Kansas City via Wichita and Topeka. A second route extending from Topeka to Salina and further west to the Colorado state line (the modern-day I-70 corridor) was also studied. Over 173,000 drivers were surveyed to determine how many of them would be willing to use the two proposed routes in order to establish their profitability. While the western Kansas route was determined not to be feasible, the Oklahoma–Kansas City route was projected to generate a total revenue of $9 million in 1957 (equivalent to $ in ). After considering a number of different alignments, including one bypassing Topeka via the present route of I-35, the state decided on an &quot;airline&quot; route between Wichita and Topeka. From Wichita south, the turnpike was to parallel US-81, continuing into Oklahoma; the interchange with US-166 at South Haven was included to provide an outlet if Oklahoma lagged in its construction. The turnpike was to parallel US-40 from Topeka to Kansas City. The Kansas City end was set at 18th Street and Muncie Boulevard, which was to be extended and upgraded to a freeway (the Muncie Expressway) to the Intercity Viaduct by the state.

After a ruling from the state supreme court that found that the KTA could issue bonds and oversee the construction and administration of the turnpike, the turnpike authority sold $160 million (equivalent to $ in ) in revenue bonds in September 1954. KTA bonds were quickly bought by investors, who were attracted by the Kansas Turnpike&#x27;s low construction costs—only one-third of that of turnpikes in other states—and projections showing that enough tolls would be collected to pay off investors after 19 years.

Ground was broken on December 31, 1954, at the Kansas River bridge near Lawrence. Construction of the entire length of the turnpike was scheduled to take place all at once, with the turnpike partitioned into 14 parts, and the overall length also divided into 43 smaller portions. The KTA sent out letters en masse to the affected landowners, offering a price and referring appeals to the local district court, which typically valued the land at a lesser amount; this methodology was not without criticism. During the construction period, the state highway department suffered a &quot;brain drain&quot; as many staffers resigned to take up KTA jobs, which paid better salaries (Chairman Moss&#x27;s KTA salary was three times that of his salary as director of highways) and offered more exciting challenges.

In June 1956, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 was signed into law, granting funding to the nationwide Interstate Highway System. Without its Oklahoma link, the Kansas Turnpike was in danger of being bypassed by the Interstate System entirely. However, at the end of 1956, the Bureau of Public Roads and the state of Kansas agreed to route I-35 along the turnpike south of Emporia and I-70 along the piece east of Topeka. The state insisted on a separate Emporia–Kansas City alignment, and the mileage that would have been used to build I-35 from Wichita to Emporia via Newton was instead used for I-35W (now I-135) from Wichita via Newton to Salina.

After almost 22 months of construction, the road was opened for a day of free travel on October 20, 1956, between 6:00 am and 2:00 pm. An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 cars traveled on the turnpike. Many of those motorists traveled to Lawrence for a football game between the University of Kansas and University of Oklahoma. Official opening ceremonies were held at interchanges in each of the three major cities on October 25. The Kansas City celebration included Gene Autry jumping his horse through a large paper map of the turnpike. John Masefield, the British Poet Laureate, wrote a tribute to commemorate the occasion. On the first day after the official opening, 7,197 vehicles traveled the turnpike, with 81 toll collectors and 50 maintenance workers on duty. The turnpike originally had 14 interchanges; by 2012, there were 22.

===Southern terminus===
Despite Oklahoma&#x27;s role in instigating the construction of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as the KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time, many states&#x27; turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.

With no counterpart to the south, the Kansas Turnpike ended at the state line, at an at-grade intersection with E0010 Road. Just across the state line was an oat field, into which many inattentive motorists crashed. This abrupt end became nationally famous after Wyoming Governor Milward L. Simpson and his wife crashed in mid-1957. The oat farmer plowed the field to provide a safer landing, and the KTA was persuaded to install a huge wooden barrier at the end of the highway. However, within a day, three more drivers had crashed and destroyed the barrier, so the KTA closed the turnpike south of the South Haven interchange. The KTA provided the state of Oklahoma with financial aid to construct its portion of a temporary road leading to the interchange. The lack of continuity in the highway was one of the primary reasons that the road did not generate much revenue in the years following the opening; another reason was a lack of education on the part of motorists as to the concept of a toll road.

Although Oklahoma&#x27;s plans to construct a toll road from the southern end of the Kansas Turnpike at the state line to Oklahoma City did not materialize, a year and a half after the opening of the turnpike, a connection to US 177 at Braman was put into service on April 22, 1958. Eventually, I-35 was completed south to Oklahoma City.

===Later history===
While the initial turnpike was still being built, the KTA authorized four feasibility studies in October 1954. Three of them—a spur to Leavenworth and Saint Joseph, Missouri; a spur from Wichita to Hutchinson, Great Bend, and Hays; and a new Intercity Viaduct to Kansas City, Missouri—did not go anywhere. But the fourth proposal, a toll bridge on 18th Street in Kansas City, was pushed through, and the KTA agreed to build the turnpike in early 1956. The 18th Street Expressway, running south from the turnpike&#x27;s east end over the Kansas River, opened in 1959, improving access to northeast Johnson County.

As the turnpike did not use any state tax revenue for maintenance, the pavement began to deteriorate rapidly, and crews faced difficulty keeping up with the snow in winter conditions in a winter storm during 1960. In the early 1960s, many senior positions in the KTA were cut, and, thanks to this and other austerity measures, such as targeting maintenance to save costs in the future, the turnpike slowly became profitable. By 1966, it was clear that the turnpike had not been built to the higher standards of the Interstate Highway System; the roadway had developed ruts and other issues due to deferred maintenance. To temporarily fix the problem, a layer of asphalt oil and a layer of sand and asphalt was used to fill in the ruts, and graded rock coated with asphalt was used to seal the road. Since the road had been originally constructed at the same time, and not built in segments over a period of time, similar maintenance issues appeared along the whole length of the road at the same time. Bridges and pavement were repaired on a rotating basis, to stagger the cost of needed repairs. The bridge over the Kansas River was widened and replaced after 1973. As economic conditions improved for the Authority, equipment was slowly replaced, and workers were given pay increases, both of which were badly needed.

The East Topeka interchange was completely rebuilt in the late 1990s, with a goal of rerouting I-70 and improving access to the turnpike. The design was completed in 1997, and the project was finished in 2001 at a cost of $98.6 million in 1999 (equivalent to $ in ).

On the evening of April 6, 2002, a grease fire broke out in the Hardee&#x27;s restaurant at the Belle Plaine service plaza. Exacerbated by heavy winds, the fire destroyed the building, which also contained a travel information center. Four fire departments responded to the scene. The assistant fire chief and fire chief of the Wellington Fire Department gave conflicting statements on whether the unavailability of the Wellington water tower, which had been emptied while it was being repainted, had hampered efforts to extinguish the blaze. The fire burned for three hours, with hot spots still smoldering the following day. No injuries were reported. The fire caused $2 million (equivalent to $ in ) in damages. The service plaza was rebuilt, with a reopening celebration occurring on July 24, 2003.

A 390-year flood event took place on the night of August 30, 2003, at the Kansas Turnpike&#x27;s crossing of Jacobs Creek, a tributary of the Cottonwood River southwest of Emporia (turnpike milepost 116). A thunderstorm that evening dropped large amounts of rain in the area, with a gauge at Plymouth reporting of rainfall in a 24-hour period. The culvert carrying Jacobs Creek under the turnpike quickly exceeded its capacity, and water rose onto the turnpike. A pool of water deep formed on the northbound lanes; the concrete median barrier initially prevented most of the water from crossing to the southbound lanes. Seven cars, all headed northbound, stalled in the floodwater. The median barrier then gave way, sweeping the stalled cars across the southbound lanes and down the creek as far as from the highway. Six people died in the flood.

Another flooding event, this one a 100-year flood, caused a portion of the Kansas Turnpike to close in 2019. In the early morning hours of May 8, rain gauges in Rose Hill registered over of rainfall in a 24-hour period. Flash flooding along Slate Creek caused that tributary of the Arkansas River to inundate the turnpike south of the Wellington exit. As a result, just after midnight, the KTA made the decision to close the turnpike between Wellington and the Oklahoma state line. The turnpike reopened on May 10. 

==Tolls==
The Kansas Turnpike uses all-electronic tolling since July 1, 2024. Cash is no longer accepted. Tolls are instead paid using K-TAG (or compatible transponder) or via license plate recognition, which sends a bill to the vehicle&#x27;s registered owner. , motorists driving two-axle vehicles (such as cars and motorcycles) pay 4.8¢ per mile driven if using a K-TAG, for a total of $11.36 to drive the entire length of the turnpike from the Oklahoma state line to Kansas City. Motorists using license plate recognition to pay their toll pay double the K-TAG rate, currently 9.6¢ per mile for a two-axle vehicle (or $22.72 for the entire length). Vehicles with more than two axles, such as semi-trucks, pay higher tolls; five-axle vehicles are charged 13.8¢ per mile with K-TAG or 27.6¢ per mile with license plate tolling and nine-axle vehicles pay 33.4¢ per mile with K-TAG or 66.8¢ per mile with license plate tolling.

Flat-rate tolls are collected at 21 open road tolling gantries located on the turnpike. Each gantry is assigned to a segment of turnpike, usually between two adjacent interchanges. Motorists passing each gantry pay the per-mile fare for the distance of that segment. The total fare for any given trip may be calculated by adding the tolls charged at each gantry along one&#x27;s route.

The Kansas Turnpike is completely self-sustaining and operated on a cash surplus of nearly $600 million (equivalent to $ in ) at end of fiscal year 2017. All costs are paid for by the tolls collected; no tax money is used for construction, maintenance, or administration. The KTA estimates that 120,000 drivers use the turnpike each day.

===K-TAG===
K-TAG is the electronic toll collection system operated by the Kansas Turnpike. The system makes use of transponder stickers, which are affixed to the vehicle&#x27;s windshield. Each account may receive up to two free K-TAG stickers. External bumper mounted transponders are alternatively available for purchase, intended for motorcycles and vehicles with specialty windshields that preclude proper functioning of the sticker tag. Accounts are free to open and require no monthly service fees, but do require a credit card or bank account on file, from which accrued tolls are automatically billed each month. K-TAG was introduced in 1995; the system was internally designed and is internally run instead of being contracted to another company, saving additional overhead costs. 

, K-TAG is compatible with NationalPass, used in several other states; PikePass, in neighboring Oklahoma; ExpressToll, in neighboring Colorado; and TxTag, EZ TAG, and TollTag in Texas. It is compatible with the SunPass system in Florida , but not currently on roads maintained by the Central Florida Expressway Authority. K-TAG is also compatible with the BestPass and PrePass commercial toll transponders, but it is not compatible with any additional systems, including the E-ZPass system in the eastern United States.

===Tolling History===

Prior to 2024, the turnpike used a ticket-based collection system. When entering the turnpike, either at one of the termini or at an interchange, a driver was issued a ticket which indicated the toll plaza at which they entered. When leaving the turnpike, this ticket was used to determine the amount of the toll. If a motorist presented a ticket at the same toll plaza it was issued from, the KTA charged a &quot;per-minute&quot; fare if the trip was more than 15 minutes. If the ticket was lost, or if the trip took over 18 hours to complete, the driver was charged the highest possible toll for that exit.

Exit 53A in Wichita, which opened in 2021, was the first cashless interchange on the turnpike system. The turnpike had a toll gantry on the exit ramp in lieu of a traditional toll plaza. Until the remainder of the turnpike went cashless in 2024, this interchange operated as a special cashless interchange within an otherwise cash-based ticketed system. Drivers without a K-TAG were asked to pay their toll online at the standard cash rates. If the toll was not paid after 10 days, a bill was mailed to the vehicle&#x27;s registered owner at a slightly higher &quot;video rate&quot;. If the mailed bill fell delinquent, the highest &quot;violation rate&quot; was charged along with late fees. 

In July 2023, the KTA announced that all existing toll booths would be replaced with cashless tolling gantries by the following year. At these toll gantries, a vehicle without K-TAG would have a picture taken of its license plate, and a bill for the toll would be mailed to its owner. In early 2024, the date for the conversion to cashless tolling was officially set to July 1, 2024.

==Route description==
The Kansas Turnpike is long. , the Kansas Turnpike has 22 interchanges and two barrier toll plazas. Many of the interchanges are designed as trumpet interchanges with a connector road to the crossroad, for easy placement of a single toll plaza on the connector.

Exit numbers were originally sequential but are assigned today by mileage from south to east, the same numbering system used by the majority of US states for their Interstate Highways as well. After passing the Bonner Springs interchange, exit numbers change to match the mileage of I-70 east from the Colorado border, which is also used on I-70 west of the turnpike. This results in discontinuous exit numbers on I-70.

===Oklahoma state line to Emporia===
The first of the highway, between its southern terminus at the Oklahoma border and Emporia, Kansas, are designated as I-35. The Kansas Turnpike is the only tolled section on this Interstate. The turnpike runs due north and south between its southern terminus and Wichita. This stretch of the highway runs parallel to US-81, which lies to the west of the turnpike.

The Kansas Turnpike begins at the Oklahoma state line north of Braman, Oklahoma. This is also the point at which I-35 crosses from Kay County to Sumner County. The turnpike proceeds due north from the state line, with no interchanges for its first in Kansas. The southernmost interchange on the turnpike is exit 4 (South Haven), which serves US-166. US-166 heads east to Arkansas City and west to US-81 at South Haven. This interchange is a four-ramp folded diamond with ramps in the southeast and northwest quadrants. It has no toll plazas, as it lies south of the southern barrier toll. Northbound traffic must exit at US-166 to avoid paying a toll. Initially, the interchange provided only a southbound exit and northbound entrance, forcing drivers who did not wish to pay a toll to leave I-35 in Oklahoma. By 1976, the other two ramps had been added.

From exit 4, the turnpike continues on a due north course, crossing Slate Creek, before coming to the Southern Terminal barrier toll plaza, where tickets are issued for all northbound traffic, and fares are collected from southbound traffic. The next interchange north of the toll plaza is exit 19 (Wellington), serving US-160, which heads west to Wellington, the county seat of Sumner County, and east to Winfield, the seat of adjoining Cowley County. It is the first of many trumpet interchanges serving the surface road via a connector road with a toll plaza. When the turnpike first opened, the US-160 interchange was a reverse diamond with four loop ramps, so that all traffic using the interchange had to pass under the bridge and thus through the toll plaza. The new configuration was built .

The freeway takes a brief jog to the northeast before crossing over a Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail line southeast of Riverdale. In the median at mile 26 is the Belle Plaine Service Area. North of the service plaza, the highway bridges the Ninnescah River and then K-55/East 90th Avenue North. No interchange is present to allow turnpike travelers to connect to the K-55.

The turnpike&#x27;s next interchange is exit 33 (Mulvane), which connects to K-53/East 119th Street South via a trumpet ramp, just east of the west end of K-53 at US-81. The interchange was built . It was reconstructed in 2011 to serve the Kansas Star Casino with roundabouts on each side of the flyover. The east roundabout directs traffic to K-53. The west roundabout directs traffic to the casino. There is now a toll booth on the casino side of the intersection as well as the one on the entrance to K-53. This interchange straddles the Sumner–Sedgwick county line.
In southern Sedgwick County, the Kansas Turnpike enters the Wichita metropolitan area. Exit 39 (Haysville) serves two of Wichita&#x27;s southern suburbs. This exit is a diamond interchange with a connector road (South Mead Drive) to East 71st Street South, which runs west to US-81 and Haysville and east to Derby. It was built . Now in Wichita proper, the highway reaches exit 42 (South Wichita), which is the south end of I-135. I-135 heads north through Wichita, the largest city in Kansas, toward Salina; US-81 joins at the first interchange and I-235 begins at the second. The interchange is a simple trumpet with I-135, and opened in 1956 with the turnpike, but the connector ended at 47th Street (now US-81) until .

After passing exit 42, the turnpike curves away from US-81, turning northeast toward El Dorado and Emporia. It crosses the Arkansas River between exits 42 and 45. Exit 45 (Wichita) is a trumpet connection to K-15/Southeast Boulevard and Turnpike Drive in southern Wichita. It opened in 1956 as one of the original interchanges. As the highway continues northeast through Wichita, it comes to exit 50 (East Wichita), a double-trumpet connection to the parallel Kellogg Avenue, which carries US-54 and US-400. It is one of the original 1956 interchanges. Exit 53, the final Wichita exit, is a trumpet connection to the K-96 freeway. The connector road junctions K-96 at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and ends at North 127th Street East. The interchange opened along with the nearby piece of K-96.

East of exit 53, the turnpike passes into Butler County. Exit 57 (Andover) connects to East 21st Street northeast of downtown Andover, an eastern suburb of Wichita. The turnpike uses a diamond interchange with the connector road (Southwest Cross Road) to East 21st Street. This interchange opened . It crosses the Whitewater River southwest of the Towanda Service Area in the median at mile 65. From the service area, the highway proceeds northeast to exit 71 (El Dorado), a trumpet connection to K-254 just east of its junction with K-196. The connector originally directly intersected K-254, but it now ends between K-254/West Central Avenue and West 6th Avenue at Boyer Road just north of K-254. Exit 71 opened with the original turnpike in 1956. North of El Dorado, exit 76 (El Dorado) connects the Kansas Turnpike to US-77/North Main Street via a trumpet ramp. It opened .

After passing through El Dorado, the Kansas Turnpike crosses the northernmost arms of El Dorado Lake. This marks the turnpike&#x27;s entry into the Flint Hills, a band of hills in eastern Kansas. The turnpike does not leave this region completely until it reaches Topeka. As the highway continues northeast past El Dorado Lake, it runs roughly parallel to the Walnut River to the west, which feeds the reservoir, and K-177 to the east. Northwest of the town of Cassoday, K-177 finally crosses the turnpike, with exit 92 (Cassoday), a diamond interchange, providing a connector to the state highway. The interchange was not present when the turnpike opened in 1956 but was built soon after as an east-facing folded diamond with two separate toll plazas. The present configuration was built c. 1995. Near this interchange, the turnpike crosses the Walnut River.

Northeast of the Cassoday interchange, the Kansas Turnpike enters Chase County. In the median at mile 97, just north of the county line, is the Matfield Green Service Area. Approximately northeast of the service area, an interchange provides access to a set of cattle pens southeast of Bazaar. Other than these two service exits, there are no interchanges within Chase County; upon leaving it, the turnpike passes into Lyon County.

The next interchange along the turnpike is exit 127 (Emporia). At this trumpet interchange, I-35 leaves the turnpike to head east through Emporia, the county seat of Lyon County, on its way northeast to Kansas City via Ottawa. The interchange, as opened in 1956 with the original turnpike, connected directly to US-50 at Overlander Street; a different configuration opened along with the connecting piece of I-35. In 2005, the KTA approved reconstruction of the Emporia interchange to improve connections to US-50, I-35, and the city of Emporia, resulting in the present configuration. This project, funded by the KTA, the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT), and the city of Emporia, was completed in 2008.

===Emporia to Topeka===

After the split with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike continues northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely as a part of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.

Northeast of Emporia, the Emporia Service Area is in the median at mile 132. The turnpike continues northeast through the northern reaches of the Flint Hills, coming to an interchange with US 56 near Admire. This interchange, exit 147, is the only interchange along the I-335 section of the turnpike other than the two end junctions. It is a trumpet connection to US 56, which heads west to Council Grove and east to Osage City, and was one of the original 1956 interchanges.

From the Admire exit, the Kansas Turnpike continues northeast, passing through the southeast corner of Wabaunsee County and the northwestern part of Osage County. The turnpike enters Shawnee County and continues through rural land before it heads into the Topeka area. Here, the roadway has an interchange that serves I-470 and US 75 at exit 177. At this point, I-335 ends and I-470 joins the turnpike as it passes through suburban development in the southeastern part of Topeka. In the eastern portion of the city, the highway reaches an interchange with I-70, US 40, and K-4 at exits 182 and 183.

===Topeka to Kansas City===
The remainder of the turnpike runs on I-70 from Topeka to the turnpike&#x27;s eastern terminus in Kansas City. This is one of only two tolled sections of I-70. The turnpike continues east along I-70 and crosses Tecumseh Creek. The Topeka Service Area is located on the north side of the road east of here at mile 188. It is accessed by ramps on the right side of the highway in both directions. Just east of the service area, the turnpike enters Douglas County while passing over US 40 without an interchange. The route then curves to the southeast and runs roughly parallel to US 40. A series of curves takes the turnpike farther east as it reaches exit 197 (Lecompton), a folded diamond interchange with the western terminus of K-10. After this, the highway continues farther east and enters the city of Lawrence, where it shares a diamond interchange with McDonald Drive at exit 202 (West Lawrence). McDonald Drive leads to US 59 south of the turnpike. East of here, the highway bends east-northeasterly, crosses the Kansas River, and then intersects US 40 and US 59, which run concurrently, at exit 204 (East Lawrence).

The Kansas Turnpike then leaves Lawrence and bends to the northeast before leaving Douglas County and entering Leavenworth. It overpasses Mud Creek before passing under K-32. Northeast of here at mile 209, the Lawrence Service Area is in the median. Afterward, the turnpike has a diamond interchange with 222nd Street, which is signed as Leavenworth County Road 1, at exit 212 (Tonganoxie/Eudora). The highway then travels northeast and passes through it eastern terminal toll booth. This is the final toll booth on the route traveling east, and all vehicles must pay their final toll before continuing. The turnpike then enters Bonner Springs. It crosses Wolf Creek before leaving Leavenworth County and entering Wyandotte County. In Bonner Springs, the turnpike intersects K-7, westbound US 24, westbound US 40, and the southern terminus of US 73 at exit 224 (Bonner Springs, formerly exit 223) with a trumpet interchange. This is the first free exit eastbound. The mileposts on the route switch to match those of I-70 after this interchange.

US 24 and US 40 run concurrently with I-70 and the Kansas Turnpike as it heads east toward Kansas City. Exit 410 on the turnpike is a diamond interchange with North 110th Street. This interchange is located just south of the Kansas Speedway. Just east of here, the route intersects I-435 at exit 411. This exit uses a cloverleaf interchange with one directional ramp and collector–distributor roads to avoid issues with traffic exiting immediately north of the turnpike. After this interchange, the highway enters Kansas City.

The turnpike&#x27;s first exit in the city is exit 414, a diamond interchange with North 78th Street. Next, the highway curves slightly to the northeast and intersects the Turner Diagonal at exit 415, an interchange consisting of a half-cloverleaf interchange for the western ramps and a Y-interchange for the eastern ramps that intersects the Turner Diagonal at a trumpet interchange north of the turnpike. East of here, the route has a diamond interchange with North 57th Street at exit 417. Directly east of North 57th Street, the turnpike crosses Brenner Heights Creek. After this, the turnpike continues due east to a fully directional interchange with I-635 at exit 418.

After this interchange, the freeway bends in a southeastern direction and reaches its final exit, exit 420. This exit is a cloverleaf interchange with US 69, which is also known as the 18th Street Expressway. At this interchange, US 69 turns east to overlap I-70, US 40, and US 24, and the highways continue east of exit 420 toward Kansas City, Missouri.

==Design==

Because the Kansas Turnpike was built before the Interstate Highway System, it is not engineered to current Interstate Highway standards; however, as with all other toll roads that predated the Interstate Highway System, the highway is grandfathered from Interstate standards. The turnpike was originally constructed with lanes only wide. Notably, the turnpike was built without a median. When it opened, the central reservation was a depressed median. Starting in 1985, Jersey barriers were installed along its entire length.

Kansas Turnpike mileposts are continuous along the entire length of the turnpike. Originally, milepost numbering began with 0 at the junction of the 18th Street Expressway and counted up as one traveled west then south, with milepost 236 appearing at the southern terminus. Then, in 1973, the KTA completely reversed the numbering, and now milemarkers begin at the point where I-35 enters Kansas at the southern border. These numbers are continued along the other three Interstates that make up the turnpike, rather than numbering each Interstate individually, leading to discontinuous numbering on I-70—the exit numbers on tolled I-70 are much lower than those on free I-70.

The majority of the Kansas Turnpike, from the Oklahoma state line to Topeka, was constructed with asphalt. The from Topeka to Kansas City was built with Portland cement concrete. Curves along the turnpike are limited to 3° and grades limited to 3%. Early reports said that curves were designed to accommodate speeds of . When built, the turnpike was designed to allow axle loads. Minimum sight distances were kept at . The right-of-way featured fenced edges to prevent cattle from entering the roadway and to discourage toll evasion.

===Speed limits===
When the turnpike was originally opened, it had no posted speed limit, however &quot;drivers [would] be &#x27;hailed down&#x27; if they exceed[ed] &quot;. In 1970, the speed limit was reduced to during the day and at night; authorities cited accidents caused by excess speed. Nationwide, the speed limit was reduced to on January 2, 1974; Kansas delayed implementing the reduction until the deadline on March 2, 1974.

When Congress allowed states to increase their speed limits to , Kansas increased the speed limit on most of the turnpike; the Emporia–Topeka segment did not have an Interstate designation to allow for an increase there. Other sections through urban areas remained at the lower limits as well. KDOT requested an Interstate designation for the Emporia–Topeka segment of the turnpike by May 1987, which they received on October 23, 1987, when that section was given the I-335 designation to allow for a speed limit. Later, in November 1995, Congress repealed the National Maximum Speed Limit; Kansas initially left their limits alone after the repeal. Legislation that raised the speed limits to took effect on March 22, 1996.

On July 1, 2011, the speed limit on most of the Kansas Turnpike was raised once again to as part of a set of speed limit increases affecting several rural Interstates and U.S. Highways throughout Kansas. The minimum speed is .

==Services==
The KTA provides a number of services to help motorists and provide incentives for using the turnpike. KTA broadcasts a travel radio station at 1610 AM from Wellington, Wichita, El Dorado, Cassoday, Emporia, Admire, East Topeka, and West Lawrence. Law enforcement is provided by a separate Turnpike Division of the Kansas Highway Patrol. Motorists needing assistance can use a roadside assistance hotline by dialing codice_1 (codice_2) on a mobile phone. Statewide weather and traffic conditions can be accessed by dialing codice_3. The KTA also provides weather and traffic information on their website. The original service areas were spaced apart.

There are six service areas located along the highway:
*The Belle Plaine Service Area (mile 26) opened on July 24, 2003, replacing a previous structure at the site that had been destroyed by a grease fire. It contains a 24-hour gas station and convenience store (Love&#x27;s), a fast food restaurant (McDonald&#x27;s), a weather kiosk, a Kansas Travel Information Center, and a gift shop.
*The Towanda Service Area (mile 65, six miles south of El Dorado) provides a 24-hour gas station and convenience store and a weather kiosk.
*The Matfield Green Service Area (mile 97) shares the design of the Towanda service area, and also provides a 24-hour gas station and convenience store, and a weather kiosk. The service area at Matfield Green also contains a memorial to Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, who died in a 1931 plane crash near Bazaar, a few miles north of the service area.
*The Emporia Service Area (mile 132), like the two service areas to the south, includes a 24-hour gas station and convenience store and two fast food restaurants. Additionally, the facility provides an outdoor exercise area and playground for children.
*The Topeka Service Area (mile 188) opened in May 2002. This service plaza features a gift shop and a 24-hour gas station and Love&#x27;s convenience store. Previously, five restaurants (including Hardee&#x27;s, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Dunkin Donuts) operated in the plaza, but all closed on April 14, 2023. A McDonald&#x27;s opened in that space in September 2023. Godfather&#x27;s Pizza has also opened an outlet, with individual-sized pizzas and breadsticks available. Prior to this plaza&#x27;s opening, a service area was in the median between exits 182 and 183. It closed in May 2002 when the present Topeka Service Area opened.
*The Lawrence Service Area (mile 209) consists of a 24-hour gas station and Love&#x27;s convenience store, in addition to a 24-hour McDonald&#x27;s.

<text>Katharine Teresa Gun (&quot;née&quot; Harwood; born 1974) is a British linguist who worked as a translator for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). In 2003, she leaked top-secret information to a friend who passed it to &quot;The Observer&quot;. The information concerned a request from the United States for compromising intelligence on diplomats from member states of the 2003 United Nations Security Council, who were due to vote on a second UN resolution on the prospective 2003 invasion of Iraq.

==Early life==
Katharine moved to Taiwan in 1977 with her parents, Paul and Jan Harwood. Her father studied Chinese at Durham University and taught at Tunghai University in the city of Taichung, central Taiwan. She has a younger brother who was teaching in Taiwan.

After spending her childhood in Taiwan, where she attended Morrison Academy until age 16, she returned to Britain to study for her A-levels at Moira House School, a girls&#x27; boarding school in Eastbourne. Her upbringing later led her to describe herself as a &quot;third culture kid&quot;. In 1993 she began studying Japanese and Chinese at Durham University.

She graduated with an upper second-class degree, then took a job as an assistant English teacher with the JET program in Hiroshima, Japan. She left teaching in 1999, and after some temporary jobs, finding it difficult to find work as a linguist, she applied to GCHQ in 2001 after reading a newspaper advertisement for the organisation. She was previously unaware of GCHQ, and later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have much idea about what they did...I was going into it pretty much blind. Most people do.&quot;

==Leak==
Her regular job at GCHQ in Cheltenham was to translate Mandarin Chinese into English. While at work at GCHQ on 31 January 2003, she read an email from Frank Koza, the chief of staff at the &quot;regional targets&quot; division of the American signals intelligence agency, the National Security Agency.

Koza&#x27;s email requested aid in a secret operation to bug the United Nations offices of six nations: Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea and Pakistan. These were the six &quot;swing nations&quot; on the UN Security Council that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq. The plan might have contravened Articles 22 and 27 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which regulates global diplomacy.

Outraged by the email, she took a printed copy of it home. After contemplating the email over the weekend, she gave it to a friend who was acquainted with journalists. In February, she travelled to London to take part in the demonstration against the impending invasion of Iraq. She heard no more of the email, and had all but forgotten it until Sunday 2 March, when she saw it reproduced on the front page of &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper. Less than a week after the &quot;Observer&quot; story, on Wednesday 5 March, she confessed to her line manager at GCHQ that she had leaked the email, and was arrested. In a BBC interview with Jeremy Paxman, she said that she had not raised the matter with staff counsellors as she &quot;honestly didn&#x27;t think that would have had any practical effect&quot;. She spent a night in police custody, and eight months later was charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act. While waiting to hear whether she would be charged, she embarked on a postgraduate degree course in global ethics at the University of Birmingham.

==Court case==

On 13 November 2003, she was charged with an offence under section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989. Her case became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; among activists, and many people stepped forward to urge the government to drop the case. Among them, from the US, were the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Daniel Ellsberg (the US government official who leaked the Pentagon Papers), and Congressman Dennis Kucinich.

The case came to court on 25 February 2004. Within half an hour, the case was dropped because the prosecution declined to offer evidence. At the time, the reasons for the Attorney-General to drop the case were unclear. The day before the trial, the defence team had asked the government for any records of legal advice about the lawfulness of the war that it had received during the run-up to the war. A full trial might have exposed any such documents to public scrutiny, as the defence was expected to argue that trying to stop an unlawful war of aggression outweighed her obligations under the Official Secrets Act. She was defended by Alex Bailin QC. Speculation was rife in the media that the prosecution service had bowed to political pressure to drop the case so that any such documents would remain secret. A government spokesman said that the decision to drop the case was made before the defence&#x27;s demands were submitted. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper had reported plans to drop the case the previous week. On the day of the court hearing, Gun said, &quot;I&#x27;m just baffled in the 21st century [that] we as human beings are still dropping bombs on each other as a means to resolve issues.&quot; In May 2019 &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the case was dropped &quot;when the prosecution realised that evidence would emerge ... that even British government lawyers believed the invasion was unlawful.&quot;

The film about Katharine Gun suggests that the case against her was dropped because Gun’s defence team asked for disclosure of the attorney general’s initial legal advice to Tony Blair before the invasion. In September 2019, Ken Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, confirmed the case against her was dropped because a fair trial would not have been possible without the disclosure of information that would compromise national security. 

==Personal life==
Gun&#x27;s husband, Yaşar Gün, is a Turkish Kurd. 
, Gun lives in Turkey and visits Britain. After the charges against her were dropped in 2004, she found it difficult to find new employment. , she had been living in Turkey for several years with her husband and their 11-year-old daughter.

==Later life==
Gun received the Sam Adams Award for 2003 and was supported in her case by the UK human rights pressure group Liberty and in the US by the Institute for Public Accuracy. Following the dropping of the case, Liberty commented, &quot;One wonders whether disclosure in this criminal trial might have been a little too embarrassing.&quot;

Two years after her trial, Gun wrote an article titled &quot;Iran: Time to Leak&quot;, which asked whistleblowers to make public any information about plans for a potential war against Iran. She urged &quot;those in a position to do so to disclose information which relates to this planned aggression; legal advice, meetings between the White House and other intelligence agencies, assessments of Iran&#x27;s threat level (or better yet, evidence that assessments have been altered), troop deployments and army notifications. Don&#x27;t let &#x27;the intelligence and the facts be fixed around the policy&#x27; this time.&quot;

==In film==
In January 2019, the film &quot;Official Secrets&quot;, recounting Gun&#x27;s actions in 2003, received its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, with Keira Knightley playing Gun. Daniel Ellsberg praised the swiftness and importance of Gun taking action, saying it was in some ways more significant than his own whistleblowing on the Vietnam War. In July 2019, in a lengthy interview on the US program &quot;Democracy Now!,&quot; Gun, Gavin Hood (the film&#x27;s writer, director and producer), as well as Martin Bright and Ed Vulliamy (the journalists who broke the story of the leaked memo) discussed the events that the film describes. Together with journalist Peter Beaumont, Gun advised and consulted over the years it took to make the film and they are &quot;very happy with the result.”

<text>In mathematics, the Jacobian variety &quot;J&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) of a non-singular algebraic curve &quot;C&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot; is the moduli space of degree 0 line bundles. It is the connected component of the identity in the Picard group of &quot;C&quot;, hence an abelian variety.

==Introduction==

The Jacobian variety is named after Carl Gustav Jacobi, who proved the complete version of the Abel–Jacobi theorem, making the injectivity statement of Niels Abel into an isomorphism. It is a principally polarized abelian variety, of dimension &quot;g&quot;, and hence, over the complex numbers, it is a complex torus. If &quot;p&quot; is a point of &quot;C&quot;, then the curve &quot;C&quot; can be mapped to a subvariety of &quot;J&quot; with the given point &quot;p&quot; mapping to the identity of &quot;J&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; generates &quot;J&quot; as a group.

==Construction for complex curves==

Over the complex numbers, the Jacobian variety can be realized as the quotient space &quot;V&quot;/&quot;L&quot;, where &quot;V&quot; is the dual of the vector space of all global holomorphic differentials on &quot;C&quot; and &quot;L&quot; is the lattice of all elements of &quot;V&quot; of the form
:formula_1

where &quot;γ&quot; is a closed path in &quot;C&quot;. In other words,
:formula_2
with formula_3 embedded in formula_4 via the above map. This can be done explicitly with the use of theta functions.

The Jacobian of a curve over an arbitrary field was constructed by as part of his proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over a finite field.

The Abel–Jacobi theorem states that the torus thus built is a variety, the classical Jacobian of a curve, that indeed parametrizes the degree 0 line bundles, that is, it can be identified with its Picard variety of degree 0 divisors modulo linear equivalence.

==Algebraic structure==

As a group, the Jacobian variety of a curve is isomorphic to the quotient of the group of divisors of degree zero by the subgroup of principal divisors, i.e., divisors of rational functions. This holds for fields that are not algebraically closed, provided one considers divisors and functions defined over that field.

==Further notions==
Torelli&#x27;s theorem states that a complex curve is determined by its Jacobian (with its polarization).

The Schottky problem asks which principally polarized abelian varieties are the Jacobians of curves.

The Picard variety, the Albanese variety, generalized Jacobian, and intermediate Jacobians are generalizations of the Jacobian for higher-dimensional varieties. For varieties of higher dimension the construction of the Jacobian variety as a quotient of the space of holomorphic 1-forms generalizes to give the Albanese variety, but in general this need not be isomorphic to the Picard variety.

<doc id="489736" wikidata="Q1683540" url="?curid=489736" title="Openness">
<text>Openness is an overarching concept that is characterized by an emphasis on transparency and collaboration. That is, openness refers to &quot;accessibility of knowledge, technology and other resources; the transparency of action; the permeability of organisational structures; and the inclusiveness of participation&quot;. Openness can be said to be the opposite of closedness, central authority and secrecy.

== Openness concept ==
Openness has been attributed to a wide array of approaches in very different contexts as outlined below. While there is no universally accepted definition of the overarching concept of openness, a 2017 comprehensive review concludes that:

Open terminology can refer to a higher-order concept (e.g. the ‘‘philosophy of openness’’); the nature of resources (e.g. ‘‘open data’’); the nature of processes (e.g. ‘‘open innovation’’); or the effects on specific domains (e.g. ‘‘open education’’) [...] The principles typically used to characterize this higher-order concept are: access to information and other resources; participation in an inclusive and often collaborative manner; transparency of resources and actions; and democracy or ‘‘democratization’’ such as the breaking up of exclusionary structures.

== In government ==

Open government is the governing doctrine which holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings of the government to allow for effective public oversight.

Openness in government applies the idea of freedom of information to information held by authorities and holds that citizens should have the right to see the operations and activities of government at work. Since reliable information is requisite for accountability, freedom of access to information about the government supports government accountability and helps protect other necessary rights.

== In creative works ==
Open content and free content both refer to creative works that lack restrictions on how people can use, modify, and distribute them. The terms derive from open source software and free software, similar concepts that refer specifically to software.

== In education ==

Open education refers to institutional practices and programmatic initiatives that broaden access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems. By eliminating barriers to entry, open education aids freedom of information by increasing accessibility.

Open Education advocates state people from all social classes worldwide have open access to high-quality education and resources. They help eliminate obstacles like high costs, outmoded materials, and legal instruments. These barriers impede collaboration among stakeholders. Cooperation is crucial to open education. The Open Education Consortium claims “Sharing is a fundamental attribute of education. Education means the sharing of knowledge, insights, and information with everybody. It is the foundation of new wisdom, ideas, talents, and understanding”. Open Educational Resources refer to learning materials that educators can improve and modify with permission from their publishers or authors. Creators of OERs are allowed to include a variety of items such as lesson plans, presentation slides, lecture videos, podcasts, worksheets, maps, and images.

There are legitimate tools like the Creative Commons’ licenses that students can access and use at liberty. They are allowed to translate and amend these materials. Public school teachers in the USA can share resources they developed as compliance for government-authorized standards in education. One of these is called the Common Core State Standards. Some teachers and school officials have recommended that OERs can help reduce expenses in production and distribution of course materials for primary and secondary institutions. Some teachers and school officials have recommended that OERs can help reduce expenses in production and distribution of course materials for primary and secondary institutions. Certain projects like the OER Commons as storage for open educational resources.

== In science ==

Open science refers to the practice of allowing peer-reviewed research articles to be available online free of charge and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. Benefits of this approach include: accelerated discovery and progress as researchers are free to use and build on the findings of others, giving back to the public as much research is paid for with public funds, and greater impact for one&#x27;s work due to open access articles being accessible to a bigger audience.

== In information technology ==

In Open-source software, the user is given access to the sources such as source code. In Open-source hardware, the user gets access to sources such as design documents and blueprints. Open data is data that can be freely used and shared by anyone.

== In psychology ==

In psychology, openness to experience is one of the domains which are used to describe human personality in the Five Factor Model.

<text>A demagogue (; ; ), or rabble-rouser, is a political leader in a democracy who gains popularity by arousing the common people against elites, especially through oratory that whips up the passions of crowds, appealing to emotion by scapegoating out-groups, exaggerating dangers to stoke fears, lying for emotional effect, or other rhetoric that tends to drown out reasoned deliberation and encourage fanatical popularity. Demagogues overturn established norms of political conduct, or promise or threaten to do so.

Historian Reinhard Luthin defined &quot;demagogue&quot; as &quot;a politician skilled in oratory, flattery and invective; evasive in discussing vital issues; promising everything to everybody; appealing to the passions rather than the reason of the public; and arousing racial, religious, and class prejudices—a man whose lust for power without recourse to principle leads him to seek to become a master of the masses. He has for centuries practiced his profession of &#x27;man of the people&#x27;. He is a product of a political tradition nearly as old as western civilization itself.&quot;

Demagogues have appeared in democracies since ancient Athens. Demagogues exploit a fundamental weakness in democracy: Because ultimate power is held by the people, it is possible for the people to give that power to someone who appeals to the lowest common denominator of a large segment of the population. Demagogues have usually advocated immediate, forceful action to address a crisis while accusing moderate and thoughtful opponents of weakness or disloyalty. Many demagogues elected to high executive office have unraveled constitutional limits on executive power and tried to convert their democracy into a dictatorship, sometimes successfully.

==History and definition of the word==
Demagogue, a term originally referring to a leader of the common people, was first coined in ancient Greece with no negative connotation, but eventually came to mean a troublesome kind of leader who occasionally arose in Athenian democracy. Even though democracy gave power to the common people, elections still tended to favor the aristocratic class, which favored deliberation and decorum. Demagogues were a new kind of leader who emerged from the lower classes. Demagogues relentlessly advocated action, usually violent—immediately and without deliberation.

The term &quot;demagogue&quot; has been used to disparage leaders perceived as manipulative, pernicious, or bigoted. However, what distinguishes a demagogue can be defined independently of whether the speaker favors or opposes a certain political leader. A demagogue is defined by how they gain or hold democratic power: by exciting the passions of the lower classes and less-educated people in a democracy toward rash or violent action and breaking established democratic institutions such as the rule of law. James Fenimore Cooper in 1838 identified four fundamental characteristics of demagogues:
* They present themselves as a man or woman of the common people, opposed to the elites.
* Their politics depends on a visceral connection with the people, which greatly exceeds ordinary political popularity.
* They manipulate this connection, and the raging popularity it affords, for their own benefit and ambition.
* They threaten or outright break established rules of conduct, institutions, and even the law.

The central feature of demagoguery is persuasion by means of passion, shutting down reasoned deliberation and consideration of alternatives. While many politicians in a democracy make occasional small sacrifices of truth, subtlety, or long-term concerns to maintain popular support, demagogues do these things relentlessly and without self-restraint. Demagogues &quot;pander to passion, prejudice, bigotry, and ignorance, rather than reason.&quot;

The Austrian philosopher of language and political scientist differentiates between populism and demagoguery, asserting that &quot;[a] central aspect that distinguishes populism from demagoguery is that demagogues in politics possess substantial systemic power for mobilization, which poses a serious threat to democracy.&quot; In political practice, he argues, a clear indication of demagoguery is when &quot;the person, the party, and the political program merge, manifesting as over-identification and over-personalization in a single leading figure.&quot;

==History and characteristics of demagogues==
Demagogues have risen to power in democracies from Athens to the present day. While many demagogues have unique, colorful personalities, the psychological tactics they use have been similar throughout history (see below). 

Often considered the first demagogue, Cleon of Athens is remembered mainly for the brutality of his rule and his near destruction of Athenian democracy, resulting from his &quot;common-man&quot; appeal to disregard the moderate customs of the aristocratic elite. Modern demagogues include Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Huey Long, Father Coughlin, and Joseph McCarthy, all of whom built mass followings the same way that Cleon did: by exciting the passions of the masses against customs and norms of the aristocratic elites of their times. All, ancient and modern, meet Cooper&#x27;s four criteria above: claiming to represent the common people, inciting intense passions among them, exploiting those reactions to take power, and breaking or at least threatening established rules of political conduct, though each in different ways.

Demagogues have often exploited the lower classes and less-educated people in society. While democracies are designed to ensure freedom for all and popular control over government authority, demagogues gain power by using popular support to undermine those same freedoms and laws. The Greek historian Polybius thought that democracies are inevitably undone by demagogues. He said that every democracy eventually decays into &quot;a government of violence and the strong hand&quot;, leading to &quot;tumultuous assemblies, massacres, banishments&quot;.

While conventional wisdom positions democracy and fascism as opposites, ancient political theorists understood that democracy had an innate tendency to lead to an extreme populist government and provide demagogues with an ideal opportunity to gain power. Ivo Mosley argued that totalitarian regimes may be the logical outcome of unfettered mass democracy.

==Methods==
There are a number of common tactics demagogues have employed throughout history to manipulate public sentiment and incite crowds. Not all demagogues use all of these methods, and no two demagogues use exactly the same methods to gain popularity and loyalty. Even ordinary politicians use some of these techniques from time to time; a politician who failed to stir emotions at all would have little hope of being elected. What these techniques have in common, and what distinguishes demagogues&#x27; use of them, is their consistent intent to prevent reasoned deliberation by stirring up overwhelming passion.

In contrast to a demagogue, a politician&#x27;s ordinary rhetoric seeks &quot;to calm rather than excite, to conciliate rather than divide, and to instruct rather than flatter.&quot;

===Scapegoating===
The most fundamental demagogic technique is scapegoating: blaming the in-group&#x27;s troubles on an out-group, usually of a different ethnicity, religion, or social class. For example, McCarthy claimed that all of the problems of the U.S. resulted from &quot;communist subversion.&quot; Denis Kearney blamed all the problems of laborers in California on Chinese immigrants. Hitler blamed Jews for Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I as well as the economic troubles that came afterward. This was central to his appeal: many people said that the only reason they liked Hitler was because he was against the Jews. Fixing blame on the Jews gave Hitler a way to intensify nationalism and unity.

The claims made about the scapegoated class are mostly the same regardless of the demagogue and regardless of the scapegoated class or the nature of the crisis that the demagogue is exploiting. &quot;We&quot; are the &quot;true&quot; , and &quot;they&quot;, the , have cheated &quot;us&quot; plain folk and are living in decadent luxury off riches that rightfully belong to &quot;us&quot;. &quot;They&quot; are plotting to take over, are now rapidly taking power, or are already secretly running the country. &quot;They&quot; are subhuman, sexual perverts who will seduce or rape &quot;our&quot; daughters, and if &quot;we&quot; do not expel or exterminate &quot;them&quot; right away, doom is just around the corner.

===Fearmongering===
Many demagogues have risen to power by evoking fear in their audiences, to stir them to action and prevent deliberation. Fear of rape, for example, is easily evoked. &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot; Tillman&#x27;s rhetoric was most vivid when he was describing imaginary scenes in which white women were raped by black men lurking by the side of the road. He depicted black men as having an innate &quot;character weakness&quot; consisting of a fondness for raping white women. Tillman was elected governor of South Carolina in 1890, and elected senator repeatedly from 1895 to 1918.

After the September 11 attacks in the United States, terrorism and national security became prominent political issues. After Democrats lost control of the Congress in 2004, former U.S. president Bill Clinton opined: &quot;When people are feeling insecure, they&#x27;d rather have someone who is strong and wrong rather than somebody who is weak and right.&quot; The Clinton aphorism was later applied to describe why the political tactics of Donald Trump were successful, and how Democrats might do better in related elections.

===Lying===
Demagogues typically choose their words for their emotional effect on the audience, often without regard for factual truth or for potential danger. Demagogues are opportunistic, saying whatever will generate controversy and spur public energy. Other demagogues may believe falsehoods they tell.

If one lie does not work, a demagogue often adds more lies. Joseph McCarthy claimed to have a list of 205 members of the Communist Party working in the State Department. Then, he announced there were 57 &quot;card-carrying Communists&quot;. When pressed for names, McCarthy said that records were not available to him, but he knew &quot;absolutely&quot; that &quot;approximately&quot; 300 Communists were certified to the Secretary of State for discharge but &quot;approximately&quot; 80 were actually discharged. McCarthy never found a Communist in the State Department.

===Emotional oratory and personal charisma===
Many demagogues have demonstrated remarkable skill at moving audiences to great emotional depths and heights during a speech. Sometimes this is due to exceptional verbal eloquence, sometimes personal charisma, and sometimes both. 

Hitler often began his speeches by speaking slowly, in a low, resonant voice, telling of his life in poverty after serving in World War I, suffering in the chaos and humiliation of postwar Germany, and resolving to reawaken the Fatherland. Gradually, he would escalate the tone and tempo of his speech, ending in a climax in which he shrieked his hatred of Bolsheviks, Jews, Czechs, Poles, or whatever group he currently perceived as standing in his way—mocking them, ridiculing them, insulting them, and threatening them with destruction. Normally reasonable people became caught up in the peculiar rapport that Hitler established with his audience, believing even the most obvious lies and nonsense while under his spell. Hitler was not born with these vocal and oratorical skills; he acquired them through long and deliberate practice.

A more ordinary silver-tongued demagogue was the Negro-baiter James Kimble Vardaman (Governor of Mississippi 1904–1908, Senator 1913–1919), admired even by his opponents for his oratorical gifts and colorful language. An example, responding to Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s having invited black people to a reception at the White House: &quot;Let Teddy take coons to the White House. I should not care if the walls of the ancient edifice should become so saturated with the effluvia from the rancid carcasses that a Chinch bug would have to crawl upon the dome to avoid asphyxiation.&quot; Vardaman&#x27;s speeches tended to have little content; he spoke in a ceremonial style even in deliberative settings. His speeches served mostly as a vehicle for his personal magnetism, charming voice, and graceful delivery.

The demagogues&#x27; charisma and emotional oratory many times enabled them to win elections despite opposition from the press. The news media informs voters, and often the information is damaging to demagogues. Demagogic oratory distracts, entertains, and enthralls, steering followers&#x27; attention away from the demagogue&#x27;s usual history of lies, abuses of power, and broken promises. The advent of radio enabled many 20th-century demagogues&#x27; skill with the spoken word to drown out the written word of newspapers.

===Accusing opponents of weakness and disloyalty===
Cleon of Athens, like many demagogues who came after him, constantly advocated brutality in order to demonstrate strength, and argued that compassion was a sign of weakness that would only be exploited by enemies. &quot;It is a general rule of human nature that people despise those who treat them well and look up to those who make no concessions.&quot; At the Mytilenian Debate over whether to recall the ships he had sent the previous day to slaughter and enslave the entire population of Mytilene, he opposed the very idea of debate, characterizing it as an idle, weak, intellectual pleasure: &quot;To feel pity, to be carried away by the pleasure of hearing a clever argument, to listen to the claims of decency are three things that are entirely against the interests of an imperial power.&quot;

Distracting from his lack of evidence for his claims, Joe McCarthy persistently insinuated that anyone who opposed him was a communist sympathizer. G.M. Gilbert summarized this rhetoric as &quot;I&#x27;m agin&#x27; Communism; you&#x27;re agin&#x27; me; therefore you must be a communist.&quot;

===Promising the impossible===
Another fundamental demagogic technique is making promises only for their emotional effect on audiences, without regard for how they might be accomplished or without intending to honor them once in office. Demagogues express these empty promises simply and theatrically, but remain extremely hazy about how they will achieve them because usually they are impossible. For example, Huey Long promised that if he were elected president, every family would have a home, an automobile, a radio, and $2,000 yearly. He was vague about how he would make that happen, but people still joined his Share-the-Wealth clubs. Another kind of empty demagogic promise is to make everyone wealthy or &quot;solve all the problems&quot;. The Polish demagogue Stanisław Tymiński, running as an unknown &quot;maverick&quot; on the basis of his prior success as a businessman in Canada, promised &quot;immediate prosperity&quot;—exploiting the economic difficulties of laborers, especially miners and steelworkers. Tymiński forced a runoff in the 1990 presidential election, nearly defeating Lech Wałęsa.

=== Violence and physical intimidation ===
Demagogues have often encouraged their supporters to violently intimidate opponents, both to solidify loyalty among their supporters and to discourage or physically prevent people from speaking out or voting against them. &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot; Tillman was repeatedly re-elected to the U.S. Senate largely through violence and intimidation. He spoke in support of lynch mobs, and he disenfranchised most black voters with the South Carolina constitution of 1895. Hitler wrote in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; that physical intimidation was an effective way to move the masses. Hitler intentionally provoked hecklers at his rallies so that his supporters would become enraged by their remarks and assault them.

===Personal insults and ridicule===
Many demagogues have found that ridiculing or insulting opponents is a simple way to shut down reasoned deliberation of competing ideas, especially with an unsophisticated audience. &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot; Tillman, for example, was a master of the personal insult. He got his nickname from a speech in which he called President Grover Cleveland &quot;an old bag of beef&quot; and resolved to bring a pitchfork to Washington to &quot;poke him in his old fat ribs.&quot; James Kimble Vardaman consistently referred to President Theodore Roosevelt as a &quot;coon-flavored miscegenationist&quot; and once posted an ad in a newspaper for &quot;sixteen big, fat, mellow, rancid coons&quot; to sleep with Roosevelt during a trip to Mississippi.

A common demagogic technique is to pin an insulting epithet on an opponent, by saying it repeatedly, in speech after speech, when saying the opponent&#x27;s name or in place of it. For example, James Curley referred to Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., his Republican opponent for Senator, as &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot;. William Hale Thompson called Anton Cermak, his opponent for mayor of Chicago, &quot;Tony Baloney&quot;. Huey Long called Joseph E. Ransdell, his elderly opponent for Senator, &quot;Old Feather Duster&quot;. Joe McCarthy liked to call Secretary of State Dean Acheson &quot;The Red Dean of Fashion&quot;. The use of epithets and other humorous invective diverts followers&#x27; attention from soberly considering how to address the important public issues of the time, scoring easy laughs instead.

===Vulgarity and outrageous behavior===
Legislative bodies usually have sober standards of decorum that are intended to quiet passions and favor reasoned deliberation. Many demagogues violate standards of decorum outrageously, to show clearly that they are thumbing their noses at the established order and the genteel ways of the upper class, or simply because they enjoy the attention that it brings. The common people might find the demagogue disgusting, but the demagogue can use the upper class&#x27;s contempt for him to show that he will not be shamed or intimidated by the powerful.

For example, Huey Long famously wore pajamas to highly dignified occasions where others were dressed at the height of formality. He once stood &quot;bukk nekkid&quot; at his hotel suite when laying down the law to a meeting of political fuglemen. Long was &quot;intensely and solely interested in himself. He had to dominate every scene he was in and every person around him. He craved attention and would go to almost any length to get it. He knew that an audacious action, although it was harsh and even barbarous, could shock people into a state where they could be manipulated.&quot; He was &quot;...so shameless in his pursuit of publicity, and so adept at getting press coverage, that he was soon attracting more attention from the press and the galleries than most of the rest of his colleagues combined.&quot;

In ancient Greece, Aristotle pointed out the bad manners of Cleon more than 2,000 years ago: &quot;[Cleon] was the first who shouted on the public platform, who used abusive language and who spoke with his cloak girt about him, while all the others used to speak in proper dress and manner.&quot;

===Folksy posturing===
Demagogues often make a show of appearing to be down-to-earth, ordinary citizens just like the people whose votes they seek. In the United States, many took folksy nicknames: William H. Murray (1869–1956) was &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot;; James M. Curley (1874–1958) of Boston was &quot;Our Jim&quot;; Ellison D. Smith (1864–1944) was &quot;Cotton Ed&quot;; the husband-and-wife demagogue team of Miriam and James E. Ferguson went by &quot;Ma and Pa&quot;; Texas governor W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel (1890–1969) was &quot;Pappy-Pass-the-Biscuits&quot;.

Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge (1884–1946) put a barn and a henhouse on the executive mansion grounds, loudly explaining that he could not sleep nights unless he heard the bellowing of livestock and the cackling of poultry. When in the presence of farmers, he chewed tobacco and faked a rural accent—though he himself was college-educated—railing against &quot;frills&quot; and &quot;nigger-lovin&#x27; furriners&quot;. Talamadge defined &quot;furriner&quot; as &quot;Anyone who attempts to impose ideas that are contrary to the established traditions of Georgia.&quot; His grammar and vocabulary became more refined when speaking before an urban audience. Talmadge was famous for wearing gaudy red galluses, which he snapped for emphasis during his speeches. On his desk, he kept three books that he loudly told visitors were all that a governor needed: a bible, the state financial report, and a Sears–Roebuck catalog.

Huey Long emphasized his humble roots by calling himself &quot;The Kingfish&quot; and gulping down pot likker when visiting northern Louisiana. He once issued a press release demanding that his name be removed from the Washington &quot;Social Register&quot;. &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; made sure to remind people of his rural background by talking in the terminology of farming: &quot;I will plow straight furrows and blast all the stumps. The common people and I can lick the whole lousy gang.&quot;

===Gross oversimplification===
Demagogues commonly treat complex problems, which require patient reasoning and analysis, as if they result from one simple cause or can be solved by one simple cure. For example, Huey Long claimed that all of the U.S.&#x27;s economic problems could be solved just by &quot;sharing the wealth&quot;. Hitler claimed that Germany had lost World War I only because of a &quot;Stab in the Back&quot;. Scapegoating (above) is one form of gross oversimplification.

===Attacking the news media===
Because factual information reported by the press can undermine a demagogue&#x27;s claims and standing among followers, modern demagogues have attacked the press intemperately. At times, demagogues have called for violence against newspapers who opposed them. Some have claimed that the press was acting secretly in the service of moneyed interests or foreign powers or that newspapers had a personal vendetta against them. Huey Long accused the New Orleans &quot;Times–Picayune&quot; and &quot;Item&quot; of being &quot;bought&quot;, and had his bodyguards rough up their reporters. Oklahoma governor &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; Murray (1869–1956) once called for a bomb to be dropped on the offices of the &quot;Daily Oklahoman&quot;. Joe McCarthy accused &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, and other leading American newspapers of being &quot;Communist smear sheets&quot; under the control of the Kremlin.

==Demagogues in power==
===Establishing one-man rule, subverting the rule of law===
In executive office, demagogues have often moved quickly to expand their power, both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot;: by getting legislation passed to officially expand their authority, and by building up networks of corruption and informal pressure to ensure that their dictates are followed regardless of constitutional authority.

For example, within two months of being appointed chancellor, Hitler unraveled all constitutional limitations on his power. He achieved this through near-daily acts of chaos, destabilizing the state and providing ever stronger reasons to justify taking more power. Hitler was appointed on January 30, 1933; on February 1, the Reichstag was dissolved; on February 27, the Reichstag building burned; on February 28, the Reichstag Fire Decree gave Hitler emergency powers and suspended civil liberties; on March 5, new general elections were held; on March 22, the first concentration camp opened, taking political prisoners. On March 24, the Enabling Act was passed, giving Hitler full legislative powers, thus ending all constitutional restraint and making Hitler absolute dictator. Consolidation of power continued even after that; see Early timeline of Nazism.

Even local demagogues have established one-man rule, or a near approximation of it, over their constituencies. &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; Murray, a demagogue who was elected governor of Oklahoma by appealing to poor rural animosity toward &quot;craven wolves of plutocracy&quot;, promised to &quot;make an open season on millionaires.&quot; Despite having presided over Oklahoma&#x27;s constitutional convention, Murray routinely violated the constitution, ruling by executive order whenever the legislature or the courts got in his way. When federal courts ruled against him, he prevailed by relying on the National Guard, even donning a military hat and pistol and personally commanding the troops—and seeing to it that the confrontation was filmed by movie cameras. Murray attempted to expand gubernatorial powers with a set of four initiatives, replacing existing income-tax law with his own, giving him power to appoint all members of the board of education, acquiring corporation-owned land, and giving him extraordinary power over the budget, but these were defeated.

===Appointing unqualified lackeys to high office; corruption===
Demagogues often appoint people to high office based on personal loyalty without regard to competence for the office—opening up extraordinary avenues for graft and corruption. During &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; Murray&#x27;s campaign for governor, he promised to crack down on corruption and favoritism for the rich, to abolish half the clerk jobs at the State House, to appoint no family members, to reduce the number of state-owned cars from 800 to 200, never to use convict labor to compete with commercial labor, and not to abuse the power of pardon. Once in office, he appointed wealthy patrons and 20 of his relatives to high office, purchased more cars, used prisoners to make ice for sale and clean the capitol building, and violated all the other promises. When the State Auditor pointed out that 1,050 new employees had been added to the state payroll, Murray simply said, &quot;Just damned lies.&quot; For each abuse of power, Murray claimed a mandate from &quot;the sovereign will of the people&quot;.

==Famous historical demagogues==

===Ancient history===
====Cleon====
The Athenian leader Cleon is often cited as a demagogue because of three events described in the writings of Thucydides and Aristophanes.

First, after a failed revolt by the city of Mytilene, Cleon persuaded the Athenians to slaughter not just the Mytilenean prisoners, but every man in the city, and to sell their wives and children as slaves. The Athenians rescinded the resolution the following day when they came to their senses.

Second, after Athens had completely defeated the Peloponnesian fleet in the Battle of Sphacteria and Sparta could only beg for peace on almost any terms, Cleon persuaded the Athenians to reject the peace offer.

Third, he taunted the Athenian generals over their failure to bring the war in Sphacteria to a rapid close, accusing them of cowardice, and declared that he could finish the job himself in 20 days, despite having no military knowledge. They gave him the job, expecting him to fail. Cleon shrank at being called to make good on his boast, and tried to get out of it, but he was forced to take the command. In fact, he succeeded—by getting the general Demosthenes to do it, now treating him with respect after previously slandering him behind his back. Three years later, Cleon and his Spartan counterpart Brasidas were killed at the Battle of Amphipolis, enabling a restoration of peace that lasted until the outbreak of the Second Peloponnesian War.

Modern commentators suspect that Thucydides and Aristophanes exaggerated the vileness of Cleon&#x27;s real character. Both had personal conflicts with Cleon, and &quot;The Knights&quot; is a satirical, allegorical comedy that does not even mention Cleon by name. Cleon was a tradesman—a leather-tanner. Thucydides and Aristophanes came from the upper classes, predisposed to look down on the commercial classes. Nevertheless, their portrayals define the archetypal example of the &quot;demagogue&quot; or &quot;rabble-rouser&quot;.

====Alcibiades====
Alcibiades convinced the people of Athens to attempt to conquer Sicily during the Peloponnesian War, with disastrous results. He led the Athenian assembly to support making him commander by claiming victory would come easily, appealing to Athenian vanity, and appealing to action and courage over deliberation. Alcibiades&#x27;s expedition might have succeeded if he had not been denied command by the political maneuvers of his rivals.

====Gaius Flaminius====
Gaius Flaminius was a Roman consul most known for being defeated by Hannibal at the Battle of Lake Trasimene during the second Punic war. Hannibal was able to make pivotal decisions during this battle because he understood his opponent. Flaminius was described as a demagogue by Polybius, in his book &quot;The Histories&quot; &quot;...Flaminius possessed a rare talent for the arts of demagogy...&quot; Because Flaminius was thus ill-suited, he lost 15,000 Roman lives, his own included, in the battle.

===Modern era===
====Adolf Hitler====
The most famous demagogue of modern history, Adolf Hitler, first attempted to overthrow the Bavarian government not with popular support but by force in a failed putsch in 1923. While in prison, Hitler chose a new strategy: to overthrow the government democratically, by cultivating a mass movement. Even before the putsch, Hitler had rewritten the Nazi party&#x27;s platform to consciously appeal to the lower classes of Germany, appealing to their resentment of wealthier classes and calling for German unity and increased central power. Hitler was delighted by the instant increase in popularity.

While Hitler was in prison, the Nazi party vote had fallen to one million, and it continued to fall after Hitler was released in 1924 and began rejuvenating the party. For the next several years, Hitler and the Nazi party were generally regarded as a laughingstock in Germany, no longer taken seriously as a threat to the country. The prime minister of Bavaria lifted the region&#x27;s ban on the party, saying, &quot;The wild beast is checked. We can afford to loosen the chain.&quot;

In 1929, with the start of the Great Depression, Hitler&#x27;s populism started to become effective. Hitler updated the Nazi party&#x27;s platform to exploit the economic distress of ordinary Germans: repudiating the Versailles Treaty, promising to eliminate corruption, and pledging to provide every German with a job. In 1930, the Nazi party went from 200,000 votes to 6.4 million, making it the second-largest party in Parliament. By 1932, the Nazi party had become the largest in Parliament. In early 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor. He then exploited the Reichstag fire to arrest his political opponents and consolidate his control of the army. Within a few years, enjoying democratic support from the masses, Hitler took Germany from a democracy to a total dictatorship.

====Huey Long====

Huey Long, nicknamed &quot;The Kingfish&quot;, was an American politician who served as the 40th governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932 and as a member of the United States Senate from 1932 until his assassination in 1935. He was a populist member of the Democratic Party and rose to national prominence during the Great Depression for his vocal criticism from the left of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal. As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and often took forceful action. A controversial figure, Long is celebrated as a populist benefactor or conversely denounced as a fascist demagogue.

In 1928, before Long was sworn in as governor of Louisiana, he was already supervising political appointments to ensure a loyal majority for all his initiatives. As governor, he ousted public officers not personally loyal to him and took control away from state commissions to ensure that all contracts would be awarded to people in his political machine. In a confrontation over natural gas with managers of the Public Service Corporation, he told them, truthfully, &quot;A deck has 52 cards and in Baton Rouge I hold all 52 of them and I can shuffle and deal as I please. I can have bills passed or I can kill them. I&#x27;ll give you until Saturday to decide.&quot; They yielded to Long—and became part of his ever-expanding machine.

When Long became a senator in 1932, his enemy, the lieutenant governor Paul N. Cyr, was sworn in as governor. Long, without authority, ordered state troopers to surround the executive mansion and arrest Cyr as an imposter. Long installed his ally Alvin O. King as governor, later replaced by O.K. Allen, serving as stooges for Long. Thus even in Washington, with no official authority, Long retained dictatorial control over Louisiana. When the Mayor of New Orleans, T. Semmes Walmsley, began to oppose Long&#x27;s extraordinary power over the state, Long exploited a subservient judge to justify making an armed attack on the basis of cracking down on racketeering. At Long&#x27;s order, Governor Allen declared martial law and dispatched National Guardsmen to seize the Registrar of Voters, allegedly &quot;to prevent election frauds&quot;. Then, by stuffing ballot boxes, Long ensured victory for his candidates to Congress. Long&#x27;s own racketeering operation then grew. With his &quot;trained seal&quot; legislature, armed militias, taxation used as a political weapon, control over elections, and weakened court authority to limit his power, Huey Long maintained control in Louisiana in a manner arguably comparable to that of a dictator.

====Joseph McCarthy====
Joseph McCarthy was a U.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 to 1957. Though a poor orator, McCarthy rose to national prominence during the early 1950s by proclaiming that high places in the United States federal government and military were &quot;infested&quot; with communists, contributing to the second &quot;Red Scare&quot;. Ultimately, his inability to provide proof for his claims, as well as his public attacks on the United States Army, led to the Army–McCarthy hearings in 1954, which in turn led to his censure by the Senate and fall from popularity.
== Positive demagoguery ==

=== Tactical demagoguery ===
Some scholars have challenged the consensus that demagoguery is necessarily a bad form of leadership and rhetoric. In &quot;Demagogues in American Politics&quot;, for example, Charles U. Zug argues that demagoguery can be legitimate and even good if integrated into a broader strategy for political reform and if coupled with a robust rationale for political change. Zug contrasts classical or traditional approaches to demagoguery, which assume that demagogues are motivated by vicious intentions (such as an unrestrained desire for power), with a modern approach that focuses on the external words and deeds that demagogues use to advance political goals. Relatedly, as Princeton Classicist Melissa Lane has argued, in pre-Socratic antiquity demagogues were originally viewed as neither inherently good nor inherently bad, but rather as advocates for the common people (as opposed to the oligarchs). Zug has argued that conceiving of demagoguery as an inherently negative practice incentivizes political actors to weaponize the label &quot;demagogue&quot;; as a consequence, otherwise innocent victims—such as the supposed leader of Shays&#x27; Rebellion, Daniel Shays—can be inaccurately branded as vicious, unscrupulous leaders. 

=== Demagoguery in constitutional office ===
Zug also argues that demagoguery takes on different meanings when deployed by public officials in different institutions; for example, American federal judges should be scrutinized more carefully for using demagoguery than should legislators, since the act of judging well—i.e., adjudicating legal disputes—does not require direct appeals to the public. In contrast, being an effective member of Congress requires advocating for a constituency and getting (re)elected; and these responsibilities in turn require direct public appeals, and sometimes, demagoguery.

<doc id="489746" wikidata="Q3542517" url="?curid=489746" title="Tweeddale">
<text>Tweeddale (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Srath Thuaidh/Tuaidhdail&quot;) is a committee area and lieutenancy area in the Scottish Borders council area in south-eastern Scotland. It had also been a province in the Middle Ages. From 1975 to 1996 it was a local government district. Its boundaries correspond to the historic county of Peeblesshire.

==Geography==
The area had an estimated population of 20,848 in 2015. It is one of the five committee areas in the Scottish Borders. Major settlements in the area include Peebles, Innerleithen and West Linton.

It is the traditional name for the dale (the area drained) by the upper reaches of the River Tweed. This area was considered to end before the Yarrow Water flowed into the Tweed, so the area was bounded to the south and east by the Yarrow/Tweed watershed, and to the north and east by the Gala Water/Tweed watershed.

12,770 ha of upper Tweeddale between Broughton and Peebles is designated as the Upper Tweeddale National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development.

==History==

Tweeddale was a historic district or province in the Middle Ages, bordering Teviotdale and the Marches to the east, Liddesdale and Annandale to the south, Clydesdale to the west and Lothian to the north. From the twelfth century the area was divided into sheriffdoms. The southern part of Tweeddale became the sheriffdom of Selkirkshire, also known as Ettrick Forest, whilst the northern part of Tweeddale was initially divided into two sheriffdoms, based at Peebles and Traquair, before those two were united as the single shire of Peebles, or Peeblesshire, around 1304. From then on the shires gradually became the more important areas for administration; the old provinces were not abolished as such, but their importance diminished.

==Tweeddale District==
Local government reorganisation in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 introduced a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Peeblesshire County Council was abolished and the area became part of the Borders region. The region was divided into four districts, one of which was called Tweeddale, covering the same area as pre-1975 Peeblesshire. The new Tweeddale district took over the functions of the six former districts of Peeblesshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Broughton District
*Innerleithen Burgh
*Innerleithen District
*Linton District
*Peebles Royal Burgh
*Peebles District

For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Peeblesshire was made the first Lord Lieutenant of Tweeddale when the reforms came into effect in 1975.

The Borders region and its four districts, including Tweeddale, were abolished in 1996, merging to form the present Scottish Borders council area. The area of the pre-1996 Tweeddale district continues to be used as a lieutenancy area.

===Political control===
The first election to Tweeddale District Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats were held by independents:
===Premises===
The council was based at the Council Offices on Rosetta Road in Peebles. The building had originally been built in 1856 as a workhouse, but had been extensively rebuilt and extended in 1935 to become the headquarters of Peeblesshire County Council. After the 1996 reforms the building became an area office for Scottish Borders Council and a police station.

<doc id="489748" wikidata="Q125466" url="?curid=489748" title="Coprolalia">
<text>Coprolalia ( ) is involuntary swearing or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. The word comes from the Greek (), meaning &quot;dung, feces&quot;, and () &quot;speech&quot;, from () &quot;to talk&quot;.

Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of tic disorders, in particular Tourette syndrome, although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette&#x27;s and only about 10% of Tourette&#x27;s patients exhibit coprolalia. It is not unique to tic disorders; it may also present itself as a neurological disorder.

Coprolalia is one type of coprophenomenon. Other coprophenomena include the related symptoms of copropraxia, involuntary actions such as performing obscene or forbidden gestures, and coprographia, making obscene writings or drawings.

==Characteristics==
Coprolalia encompasses the uncontrollable utterance of words and phrases that are culturally taboo or generally unsuitable for acceptable social use, when used out of context. The term is not used to describe contextual swearing. It is usually expressed out of social or emotional context, and may be spoken in a louder tone or different cadence or pitch than normal conversation. It can be a single word, or complex phrases. A person with coprolalia may repeat the word mentally rather than saying it out loud; these subvocalizations can be very distressing.

Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of Tourette syndrome, although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette&#x27;s. Typically, symptoms of coprolalia follow the development of phonic or motor tics by four to seven years. The severity of symptoms tends to peak during adolescence and subside during adulthood.  In Tourette syndrome, compulsive swearing can be uncontrollable and undesired by the person uttering the phrases. Involuntary outbursts, such as racial or ethnic slurs in the company of those most offended by such remarks, can be particularly embarrassing. The phrases uttered by a person with coprolalia do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of the person as they are unconsciously produced.

Cases of deaf Tourette patients swearing in sign language have been described.

It may occur after traumatic brain injury such as stroke and encephalitis; in other neurological conditions such as choreoacanthocytosis, seizures, and Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; and rarely in persons with dementia or obsessive-compulsive disorder in the absence of tics.

== Brain regions implicated ==
The neural mechanisms underlying the presence of coprolalia alone are poorly understood. Current research is designed to locate the brain regions that are active during an involuntary tic. Individuals with Tourette Syndrome (TS) exhibit the symptoms of coprolalia, so researchers can study subjects with TS to deduce an etiology for phonic tics. Patterns of neural activity were tracked by using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. The activity of the frontal operculum and Broca’s area (Brodmann’s area 44 and 45), may be responsible for the initiation of these vocal tics. Both of these brain areas are responsible for planning and producing speech, which are active during coprolalic vocal tic episodes.

Limbic system structures such as the posterior cingulate cortex are also activated during coprolalic vocal tics. This region of the brain is responsible for emotional processing, so its increase in activation could reveal insights as to how taboo words may be organized differently than the neurolinguistic aspect of the brain.

==Prevalence in Tourette syndrome==
Only about 10% of people with Tourette&#x27;s exhibit coprolalia, but it tends to attract more attention than any other symptom.

There is a low number of epidemiological studies on Tourette syndrome due to ascertainment bias affecting clinical studies. Studies on people with Tourette&#x27;s often &quot;came from tertiary referral samples, the sickest of the sick&quot;. Further, the criteria for Tourette&#x27;s syndrome changed in 2000 when the impairment criterion was removed from the DSM-IV-TR for all tic disorders. This resulted in an increase of diagnoses in milder cases. Additionally, many clinical studies suffer from small sample size. These factors combine to render older estimates of coprolalia occurrences outdated.

An international, multi-site database of 3,500 individuals with Tourette syndrome drawn from clinical samples found 14% of patients with Tourette&#x27;s accompanied by comorbid conditions had coprolalia, while only 6% of those with uncomplicated (&quot;pure&quot;) Tourette&#x27;s had coprolalia. The same study found that the chance of having coprolalia increased linearly with the number of comorbid conditions: patients with four or five other conditions—in addition to tics—were four to six times more likely to have coprolalia than persons with only Tourette&#x27;s.

One study of a general pediatric practice found an 8% rate of coprolalia in children with Tourette syndrome, while another study found 60% in a tertiary referral center (where typically more severe cases are referred). A more recent study in Brazil had 44 patients with Tourette syndrome, and found a 14% rate of coprolalia; a study in Costa Rica had 85 patients, and found that 20% had coprolalia; a study in Chile had 70 patients, and found an 8.5% rate of coprolalia; older studies in Japan reported a 4% incidence of coprolalia; a 1996 clinical trial, conducted in Brazil, found that only 9 of 32 patients (28%) had coprolalia. Considering the methodological issues affecting all of these reports, the consensus of the Tourette Syndrome Association is that the actual number is below 15 percent.
Specific treatment options for reliving motor and phonic tics (coprolalia) in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome include but are not limited to Botulinum toxin injections, antipsychotics or behavioral therapy depending on the individual&#x27;s severity of symptoms. 
==Management==
=== Botox Injections ===
Some patients have been treated by injecting botulinum toxin (botox) near the vocal cords. This does not prevent the vocalizations, but the partial paralysis that results helps to control the volume of any outbursts. Botox injections result in more generalized relief of tics than the vocal relief expected. Botulinum injections block neuromuscular transmission and decrease hyperactive muscle fibres thus reducing involuntary movement production.

=== Antipsychotic drugs ===
Aripiprazole is an FDA-approved antipsychotic drug that &quot;acts as an antagonist at the Dopamine receptor D2 under hyperdopaminergic conditions and displays agonist properties under hypodopaminergic conditions.&quot; D2 receptors (striatal dopamine receptors) play an essential role in motor output and the initiation of movements. The overproduction of dopamine exacerbates the production of tics. Aripiprazole works as a selective dopamine regulator controlling the release of dopamine in the brain, reducing the production of tics. Recent studies provide support for aripiprazole for symptom management. Aripiprazole oral dosages were approved in 2012 for the management of tics in children and adults.

=== Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention (CBI) ===
Habit reversal training is one of the most common CBI strategies used for patients with Tourettes syndrome. Patients work with a therapist to develop strategies to better anticipate the occurrence of potential tics and establish a designated response preventing the tics from occurring. Additionally, these therapies also support TS patients in implementing coping mechanisms following stress-inducing tics.

== Coprolalia in deaf individuals ==
Coprolalia has also been documented in deaf individuals. Non-verbal phonic tics are referred to as &quot;signing phonic tics&quot; in deaf individuals. Coprolalia in signing individuals is characterized by uncontrollable fingerspelling of obscene and inappropriate words and phrases, the production of intercourse related signs, flicking middle fingers, or compulsive repetition of signs. TS is extremely understudied in the deaf community, often being misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. Researchers are still studying the relationship between deafness and Tourette&#x27;s syndrome to combat misdiagnosis. 

==Society and culture==
The entertainment industry often depicts those with Tourette syndrome as being social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered stigmatization and the public&#x27;s misunderstanding of those with Tourette&#x27;s. The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette&#x27;s are also fodder for radio and television talk shows.

<text>A tic is a sudden and repetitive motor movement or vocalization that is not rhythmic and involves discrete muscle groups. Tics are typically brief and may resemble a normal behavioral characteristic or gesture.

Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.

Tics must be distinguished from movements of disorders such as chorea, dystonia and myoclonus; the compulsions of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and seizure activity; and movements exhibited in stereotypic movement disorder or among autistic people (also known as stimming).

==Classification==
Tics are classified as either motor or phonic, and simple or complex.

===Motor or phonic===
Motor tics are movement-based tics affecting discrete muscle groups.

Phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air through the nose, mouth, or throat. They may be alternately referred to as verbal tics or vocal tics, but most diagnosticians prefer the term &quot;phonic tics&quot; to reflect the notion that the vocal cords are not involved in all tics that produce sound.

===Simple or complex===
Simple motor tics are typically sudden, brief, meaningless movements that usually involve only one group of muscles, such as eye blinking, head jerking, or shoulder shrugging. Motor tics can be of an endless variety and may include such movements as hand clapping, neck stretching, mouth movements, head, arm or leg jerks, and facial grimacing.

A simple phonic tic can be almost any sound or noise, with common phonic tics being throat clearing, sniffing, or grunting.

Complex motor tics are typically more purposeful-appearing and of a longer nature. They may involve a cluster of movements and appear coordinated. Examples of complex motor tics are pulling at clothes, touching people, touching objects, echopraxia (repeating or imitating another person&#x27;s actions) and copropraxia (involuntarily performing obscene or forbidden gestures).

Complex phonic tics include echolalia (repeating words just spoken by someone else), palilalia (repeating one&#x27;s own previously spoken words), lexilalia (repeating words after reading them), and coprolalia (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases). Coprolalia is a highly publicized symptom of Tourette syndrome; however, only about 10% of TS patients exhibit coprolalia.

Martino, et al. have argued that tics may be considered physiological, or developmentally typical.

== Characteristics ==

Tics are described as &quot;semi-voluntary&quot; or &quot;unvoluntary&quot;, because they are not strictly &quot;involuntary&quot;—they may be experienced as a &quot;voluntary&quot; response to a premonitory urge (a sensory phenomenon that is an inner sensation of mounting tension). A unique aspect of tics, relative to other movement disorders, is that they are suppressible yet irresistible; they are experienced as an irresistible urge that must eventually be expressed.

Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, as well as positive emotions, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics. Neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks described a physician with severe Tourette syndrome (Canadian Mort Doran, M.D., a pilot and surgeon in real life, although a pseudonym was used in the book), whose tics remitted almost completely while he was performing surgery.

Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals are aware of an urge that is similar to the need to yawn, sneeze, blink, or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension that they consciously choose to release, as if they &quot;had to do it&quot;. Examples of this premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one&#x27;s throat or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one&#x27;s throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch. Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye. Some people with tics may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity.

Complex tics are rarely seen in the absence of simple tics. Tics &quot;may be challenging to differentiate from compulsions&quot;, as in the case of klazomania (compulsive shouting).

==Diagnosis==

Tic disorders occur along a spectrum, ranging from mild (transient or chronic tics) to more severe; Tourette syndrome is the more severe expression of a spectrum of tic disorders, which are thought to be due to the same genetic vulnerability. Nevertheless, most cases of Tourette syndrome are not severe. Management for the spectrum of tic disorders is similar to the management of Tourette syndrome.

Tic disorders are defined based on symptoms and duration. The fifth edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5), published in May 2013, reclassified Tourette&#x27;s and tic disorders as motor disorders listed in the neurodevelopmental disorder category, removed the word &quot;stereotyped&quot; from the definition of &quot;tic&quot; to better distinguish between stereotypies and tics, replaced transient tic disorder with provisional tic disorder, removed the criterion that tics must occur nearly every day, and removed the criterion that previously had excluded long tic-free periods (months) from counting towards the year needed to diagnose Tourette&#x27;s or Persistent (Chronic) tic disorders.

===Differential diagnosis===
Dystonias, paroxysmal dyskinesias, chorea, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis. Conditions besides Tourette syndrome that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham&#x27;s chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington&#x27;s disease, neuroacanthocytosis, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson&#x27;s disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome, and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.

Although tic disorders are commonly considered to be childhood syndromes, tics occasionally develop during adulthood; adult-onset tics often have a secondary cause. Tics that begin after the age of 18 are not diagnosed as Tourette&#x27;s syndrome, but may be diagnosed as an &quot;other specified&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; tic disorder.

Tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out other conditions: For example, when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, an EEG may be ordered, or symptoms may indicate that an MRI is needed to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson&#x27;s disease.

Individuals with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) may present with features typically associated with a tic disorder, such as compulsions that may resemble motor tics. &quot;Tic-related OCD&quot; is hypothesized to be a subgroup of OCD, distinguished from non-tic-related OCD by the content and type of obsessions and compulsions; individuals with tic-related OCD have more intrusive thoughts, and exhibit more hoarding and counting rituals than individuals with non-tic-related OCD.

Tics must also be distinguished from fasciculations. Small twitches of the upper or lower eyelid, for example, are not tics, because they do not involve a whole muscle, rather are twitches of a few muscle fibre bundles, that are not suppressible.

She entered the Montreal Conservatory of Dramatic Art, where she was trained in the classics of French theatre.

==Career==
===Early work===
Two months before she was to graduate she made her stage debut as Rosine in &quot;Le Barbier de Séville&quot; in 1961 with &quot;Theâtre de Gesù&quot;. She quit the school and was rarely out of work, being in demand for radio, stage, TV and film. Bujold made her TV debut with &quot;Le square&quot; (1963), a 60-minute TV film based on a play by Marguerite Duras, co-starring Georges Groulx.
She was in episodes of &quot;Jeudi-théâtre&quot; (&quot;Atout... Meurtre&quot;) and &quot;Les belles histoires des pays d&#x27;en haut&quot; (&quot;La terre de Bidou&quot;) and guest starred on &quot;Ti-Jean caribou&quot;.
Her Canadian feature film debut was in &quot;Amanita Pestilens&quot; (1963). She was then in an international co production &quot;La fleur de l&#x27;âge, ou Les adolescentes&quot; (1964) and had a lead role in &quot;The Earth to Drink (La terre à boire)&quot; (1964), the first Quebec feature to be privately financed.
Bujold starred in two 30 minute shorts, &quot;La fin des étés&quot; (1964) and &quot;Geneviève&quot; (1964). She toured Canada performing plays also worked steadily in radio and was voted actress of the year in Montreal.

===French films===
In 1965, she toured Russia and France with the company of the &quot;Théâtre du Rideau Vert&quot;. While in Paris, Bujold was in a play &quot;A House... and a Day&quot; when she was seen by renowned French director Alain Resnais. He selected her for a role in his film &quot;The War Is Over&quot;, opposite Yves Montand and Ingrid Thulin.
She returned home briefly to appear in &quot;Romeo and Jeannette&quot; by Jean Anouilh alongside Michael Sarrazin, for a Canadian TV show &quot;Festival&quot;. Also for that show she did productions of &quot;The Murderer&quot; and &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. She contributed with vocals in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Toy&quot;, a documentary about skateboarding in Montreal, directed by Claude Jutra (1966).

She stayed in France to make two more films: Philippe de Broca&#x27;s &quot;King of Hearts&quot; (1966), with Alan Bates, and Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;The Thief of Paris&quot; (1967), with Jean-Paul Belmondo. Bujold won the Prix Suzanne as the Discovery of the Year and Elle magazine called her The Girl of the Day. Despite having established herself in France, however, she returned to Canada.

===Return to Canada===
Then-husband Paul Almond directed her in &quot;The Puppet Caravan&quot; for &quot;Festival&quot; in 1967. She appeared in Michel Brault&#x27;s film &quot;Between Salt and Sweet Water&quot; (1967), then went to New York to play the title role in a production of &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1967) for &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; on American TV. Although she said she preferred film most and television least out of all the mediums, she received great acclaim for this including an Emmy nomination.

In Canada she starred in &quot;Isabel&quot; (1968), written and directed by Almond. It was one of the first Canadian films to be picked up for distribution by a major Hollywood studio.

===&quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; and international stardom===
International recognition came in 1969, when she starred as Anne Boleyn in Charles Jarrott&#x27;s film &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;, with Richard Burton. Producer Hal B. Wallis cast her after seeing her in &quot;Isabel&quot;.

For her performance, she received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. It was released by Universal who signed her to a three-picture contract.

Back in Canada, she did a second feature with her husband, &quot;The Act of the Heart&quot; (1970), co starring Donald Sutherland, which earned her a Best Actress at the Canadian Film Awards. She wrote and starred in a short film, &quot;Marie-Christine&quot; (1970), directed by Claude Jutra.
Wallis and Universal wanted Bujold to star in &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971) but she refused so they sued her for $450,000.

Instead she played the role of Cassandra, a Greek prophet, in Michael Cacoyannis&#x27;s film version of &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; (1971), opposite Katharine Hepburn, Vanessa Redgrave, and Irene Papas. It was shot in Spain.
In Canada, she made &quot;Journey&quot; (1972) with Almond and co-starring John Vernon. Bujold won another Canadian Film Award for Best Actress.

In 1973, after her marriage ended, she relocated to Los Angeles. Shortly thereafter, she settled the lawsuit with Universal, agreeing to a three-picture film contract starting with &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1974), with Charlton Heston.

Bujold returned to Canada to play a key role in the Sherlock Holmes film &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; (1979), which won her a Best Supporting Actress Award at the Canadian Film Awards.

For Walt Disney she appeared in the fantasy film &quot;The Last Flight of Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1980) with Elliott Gould and Charles Jarrott, director of &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;. She was directed by Almond once more in the Canadian &quot;Final Assignment&quot; (1980).

Bujold starred in a TV movie &quot;Mistress of Paradise&quot; (1981), then supported Christopher Reeve in &quot;Monsignor&quot; (1982), and Clint Eastwood in &quot;Tightrope&quot; (1984).

===Alan Rudolph===
Bujold starred in &quot;Choose Me&quot; (1984), directed and written by Alan Rudolph. She promptly made two more films for Rudolph: &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Moderns&quot; (1988), the latter set in Paris in the 1920s. She was part of his informal company of actors that he repeatedly used in his films, including Keith Carradine.

===Canada===
After a long absence from Quebec, she returned to appear in two more films by Michel Brault: &quot;The Paper Wedding&quot; (1989), and &quot;My Friend Max&quot; (1994). In between she went to France to make &quot;Rue du Bac&quot; (1991), and did another film with Almond, &quot;The Dance Goes On&quot; (1991). She had support roles in &quot;Oh, What a Night&quot; (1993), and &quot;An Ambush of Ghosts&quot; (1993).

Bujold was back in Quebec to star in &quot;Chaos and Desire&quot; (2002), directed by Manon Briand. That year she said &quot;I like doing studio films, independent films. I want to step up to the plate and do it. The role doesn&#x27;t have to be long, but it has to be essential to the film. And it&#x27;s got to be truthful to me. I defend my characters. They&#x27;re like my babies.&quot;

Bujold&#x27;s later appearances include &quot;Jericho Mansions&quot; (2003), &quot;Finding Home&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot; (2005), &quot;Disappearances&quot; (2006), and &quot;Deliver Me&quot; (2006).

In 2012, Bujold played a woman battling dementia in the sleeper romantic drama &quot;Still Mine&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented: &quot;Ms. Bujold imbues Irene with a starchy tenacity and a sharp sense of humor&quot;, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called her performance &quot;superb&quot; and &quot;remarkably detailed&quot;.

Bujold&#x27;s later films include &quot;Chorus&quot; (2015).

<doc id="489759" wikidata="Q3434503" url="?curid=489759" title="Direct effect of European Union law">
<text>In the law of the European Union, direct effect is the principle that Union law may, if appropriately framed, confer rights on individuals which not only the courts but also the public administration (on national, regional or local level) of member states of the European Union are bound to recognise and enforce.

Direct effect is not explicitly stated in any of the EU Treaties. The principle of direct effect was first established by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in &quot;Van Gend en Loos v. Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen&quot;. Direct effect has subsequently been loosened in its application to treaty articles and the ECJ has expanded the principle, holding that it is capable of applying to virtually all of the possible forms of EU legislation, the most important of which are regulations, and in certain circumstances to directives.

The ECJ first articulated the doctrine of direct effect in the case of &quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot;, the European Court of Justice laid down the criteria (commonly referred to as the &quot;Van Gend criteria&quot;) for establishing direct effect. The EU article provision had to be:
* clear,
* negative (a negative rather than a positive obligation)
* unconditional,
* containing no reservation on the part of the member state, and
* not dependent on any national implementing measure.

If these criteria were satisfied, then the right or rights in question could be enforced before national courts. Whether or not any particular measure satisfies the criteria is a matter of EU law to be determined by the EU Courts.

==Varieties of direct effect==
In &quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot; it was decided that a citizen was able to enforce a right granted by European Community legislation against the state – the question of whether rights could be enforced against another citizen was not addressed. In &quot;Defrenne v. SABENA (No. 2)&quot;, the European Court of Justice decided that there were two varieties of direct effect: vertical direct effect and horizontal direct effect, the distinction drawn being based on the person or entity against whom the right is to be enforced.

Vertical direct effect concerns the relationship between EU law and national law – specifically, the state&#x27;s obligation to ensure its observance and its compatibility with EU law, thereby enabling citizens to rely on it in actions against the state or against public bodies; an &quot;emanation of the state&quot; as defined in &quot;Foster v. British Gas plc&quot;.

Horizontal direct effect concerns the relationship between individuals (including companies). If a certain provision of EU law is horizontally directly effective, then citizens are able to rely on it in actions against each other. This indicates that a citizen is able to rely on a provision from the EU law against another citizen before the national court. These obligations can create rights for or be imposed on citizens in the Member State. Unlike treaty articles and regulations, Directives are usually incapable of being horizontally directly effective. Certain provisions of the treaties and legislative acts such as regulations are capable of being directly enforced horizontally.

==Application of direct effect==
===Treaty articles===
Direct effect is applicable when the particular provision relied on fulfils the &quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot; criteria. It is therefore applicable in the case of treaty articles (&quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot; was a claim based on a treaty article), in which case it can be both vertically and horizontally directly effective.

===Regulations===
Regulations are also subject to direct effect. As Article 288 TFEU (ex Art 249 TEC) explicitly provides that regulations &quot;Shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States&quot; the ECJ has confirmed that they are therefore in principle directly effective stating that &quot;Owing to their very nature and their place in the system of sources of Union law, regulations operate to confer rights on individuals which the national courts have a duty to protect&quot; If a specific right is conferred therefore a regulation can be both vertically and horizontally directly effective. All regulations are directly effective.

===Decisions===
Decisions are directly effective against whomever they are addressed to, as under Article 288 TFEU (ex Article 249 TEC), they are &quot;binding in its entirety... to whom [they are] addressed&quot;.

===Directives===

The landmark judgments on the direct effect of Directives are &quot;Van Duyn v Home Office&quot;, which established vertical direct effect of Directives, and &quot;Marshall v Southampton Health Authority&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Case C-271/91 1993 ECR I-4367&quot;&gt;(Case C-271/91) [1993] ECR I-4367&lt;/ref&gt; which established that there is no horizontal direct effect of unimplemented directives.

The horizontal direct effect of Directives is a contentious issue. Numerous Advocates General have supported the case for establishing horizontal direct effect. However, the ECJ has always resisted a change of the &quot;Marshall&quot; case law so as to allow a general right to invoke on unimplemented directives against private parties. In a number of cases the ECJ has established means for limiting the scope of the prohibition of horizontal direct effect, and ensure the full effectiveness of directives as much as possible.

The case of &quot;Foster v British Gas&quot; demonstrates the court&#x27;s willingness to confer the rights of a directive unto individuals, for the purpose of this case the court purported that any government organisation, nationalised company or company working in the public sector can be considered as a public body for the purpose of implementing vertical direct effect when a more narrow reading of the case might infer that horizontal direct effect would need to required for application. This is demonstrated in the case of &quot;Van Colson&quot; where the court established the practice of &#x27;reading in&#x27; a directive into existing national law to realise the directive&#x27;s effect – despite it not actually being a part of the legislation. Further case law to demonstrate this practice is &quot;Francovich v Italy&quot;, where action could be taken against the government by an individual for their failure to implement a directive and the subsequent loss of rights suffered in court.

In &quot;Grad v Finanzamt Traunstein&quot;, a case involving VAT, the ECJ ruled that a decision &quot;could&quot; be directly effective, as they imposed an obligation to achieve a required result. As the ECJ held in &quot;Becker&quot;, another case involving VAT, &quot;wherever the provisions of a directive appear...to be unconditional and sufficiently precise, those provisions may, in the absence of implementing measures adopted within the prescribed period, be relied upon as against any national provision which is incompatible with the directive or insofar as the provisions define rights which individuals are able to assert against the State.&quot;

In &quot;Pubblico Ministero v. Ratti&quot;, however, it was held that if the time limit given for the implementation of the directive has not expired, it cannot have direct effect. Directives were directly effective only if the prescribed date, by which the Member State should have implemented it, had passed. Additionally, in instances where the Member State has introduced the required legislation, but has done so defectively, the directive may still be directly effective, as in the &quot;Verbond van Nederlandse Ondernemingen (VNO)&quot; case.

Unlike Treaty provisions and regulations, directives cannot have horizontal effect (against another private individual or company), as this is adjudged contrary to the principles of legality and legal certainty (see &quot;Marshall v Southampton Health Authority&quot;). As such, Directives are currently only vertically directly effective (i.e. against the state, a concept interpreted broadly by the ECJ, including state schools and other &quot;emanations of the state&quot;). However, the obligation of EU Member States to interpret national law in a consistent and harmonious manner with EU law has been said to have produced an indirect horizontal effect regarding directives. Furthermore, in the judgments &quot;CIA Security&quot; and &quot;Unilever Italia SpA v Central Food SpA&quot;, the ECJ allowed a private party to rely on the Notification Directive against another private party. Academic commentary has typically referred to these cases as involving &quot;incidental effects&quot; of directives against private parties, as opposed to full-blown horizontal direct effect. However, the exact distinction between &quot;incidental effects&quot; and &quot;horizontal direct effect&quot; has proved difficult to draw. According to recent case law and commentary, it appears a directive can be invoked against a private party insofar as this does not affect the norm(s) directly governing the dispute at hand.

==Direct effect on procedural law==
In &quot;Comet v. Produktschap&quot;, the European Court of Justice established that the procedural rules of each member state generally apply to cases of EU law. However, two basic principles must be adhered to, namely the &quot;principle of equivalence&quot; (the procedure for EU cases must be equivalent to the procedure for domestic cases), and the &quot;principle of effectiveness&quot; (the procedure cannot render the law functionally ineffective).

<doc id="489764" wikidata="Q584293" url="?curid=489764" title="Missing (Canadian TV series)">
<text>Missing (originally titled 1-800-Missing) is a Canadian crime drama television series based on the &quot;1-800-WHERE-R-YOU&quot; book series by Meg Cabot. The series aired on the A-Channel network and W Network in Canada, and on Lifetime in the United States from August 2003 to February 2006.

The theme song was &quot;This Dream Is Real&quot;, performed by actress Gloria Reuben, was heard during the first season, while the second season, it was replaced with a song called &quot;Till I Find You&quot; performed by Kina, which was heard during the opening credits as well.

==Synopsis==
The series is centred on Jess Mastriani, played by Caterina Scorsone, a woman in her twenties who receives psychic abilities after being hit by lightning. She is employed by a special FBI Task Force because she has visions which, once interpreted, contain clues that will help her find missing people. The series initially starred Gloria Reuben as Brooke Haslett, Jess&#x27;s skeptical partner. Other stars of the series during its first season included Justina Machado as Sunny Estrada, and Dean McDermott as Alan Coyle. Alberta Watson appeared in the pilot as Jess&#x27; mother, however; the part was later recast and Watson did not appear on the show again.

In the second season, significant changes, including casting, were made. The show was completely retooled. Jess&#x27;s partner was changed to Nicole Scott, portrayed by Vivica A. Fox. Taking Sunny&#x27;s place was Mark Consuelos, and Justin Louis assumed the role of the Assistant Director John Pollock. Jess&#x27;s psychic powers remained important, but more focus was given to the other characters.

The series finale aired on February 5, 2006 alongside the show&#x27;s partner &quot;Strong Medicine&quot; and, in April 2006, it was revealed that &quot;Missing&quot; had been cancelled after a successful three-year, fifty-six-episode run. Lifetime said the show had &quot;run its course.&quot;

<text>The Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum is a historic house museum located at 15415 East Don Julian Road in City of Industry, California, that features the homes and private cemetery that belonged to the pioneer Workman-Temple family.

==Workman House==
Born in England, William Workman (1799–1876) immigrated to the United States as a young man with his older brother David. He migrated to Taos, where he married and worked for some time. Then he went further west, to the San Gabriel Valley in 1841, then within Alta California of the Mexican Republic.

He bought part of the Rancho La Puente and built an adobe house in 1842. It was enlarged over the years and, by 1870, was remodeled with the addition of brick wings and a second story, as well as impressive exterior decorative details. This renovation was said to have been designed by the first trained architect in Los Angeles, Ezra F. Kysor, designer of the extant Pico House hotel, St. Vibiana&#x27;s Cathedral, and the Perry House, all in Los Angeles. But there is no known documentation of Kysor&#x27;s work on the building. The Workman Adobe was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on November 20, 1974. It was added to the California State Register of Historic Landmarks, No. 874, in conjunction with the family &quot;El Campo Santo&quot; Cemetery on the site. An historic marker was placed on the site on 5 November 1976, the 135th anniversary of the arrival of the Workman family to the area.

The broad outlines of the structure, including large porches on the north and south sides, measure 19&#x27; deep by 72&#x27; wide. There are eight rooms on the first floor and three finished rooms (with three others evidently finished in the late 19th century) on the second story. The home was dramatically altered over the years, especially when it was used for military school classrooms from 1930 to 1935. It was later used as a residence and then office and nurses&#x27; quarters for El Encanto sanitarium from 1940 to 1963. The home and cemetery were then purchased by the City of Industry. Many original details have long been lost, but historic elements survive, such as the ca. 1870 interior staircase, two marble coal-burning fireplaces from the same period, and a ceiling cartouche from that era. Late 1970s-era restoration efforts were limited to the outside of the structure. The entire east wall was reconstructed, as it was mostly of adobe and had collapsed during work in 1977.

Two houses are open for tours on the property: admission is free, as is parking. Each is a 45-minute guided only tour. Several aspects of the house remain off limits: the cellars, upstairs of the Workman home, and dormitories of the former military school.

==La Casa Nueva (Temple residence)==
The Homestead Museum also includes &quot;La Casa Nueva&quot; a spectacular example of Spanish Colonial Revival style, built by the Temple family between 1922 and 1927. The family&#x27;s own design was drawn up by the well-known Los Angeles architectural firm of Walker and Eisen, although in 1924, Beverly Hills-based architect Roy Selden Price was hired to reconfigure the design.

The structure is largely built of adobe bricks handmade by artisans led by Pablo Urzua of Guadalajara, Jalisco, while the supervising contractor was Sylvester Cook of Whittier. The home (9,000 square feet, as built, with of dormitory space constructed in 1930 for a military school using the home) contains twenty-six rooms, including nine bedrooms, six bathrooms, a barber shop, commercial size electric cold storage unit, basement with a late 1870s bank vault for storage, and other notable features such as hand painted designs on windows as well as a vibrant use of stained glass of the period. The home is also unique as it features a madonna with child, however not with a traditional face, the face is more contemporary; wearing makeup, facial structure changed etc. The home was lived in by the Temple family for only two full years (1928 and 1929) as a fully completed structure, the home was leased to Lawrence Lewis, who was headmaster of a boys&#x27; military academy, Raenford (later Golden State), which moved from Redondo Beach and operated at the ranch from 1930 to 1935. The home and property were then owned by the California Bank and occupied by caretakers until purchased in October 1940 by Harry and Lois Brown, operators of El Encanto, a sanitarium moved to the site from Monrovia. The Brown family took excellent care of the house until it was sold to the City of Industry in 1975.

Restoration took place in subsequent years with the home opened as part of the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum in May 1981. While most of the house was intact, some replication was done and the house was almost entirely furnished with acquired period pieces, though some original family furniture and artifacts have been donated by Temple descendants.

==&quot;El Campo Santo&quot; Cemetery==
The family cemetery, &quot;El Campo Santo&quot;, was established in the 1850s. The earliest documented date is the burial of founder William Workman&#x27;s older brother, David, in November 1855. A year later, artist Henry Miller, touring California to visit and sketch the Spanish and Mexican-era Roman Catholic missions, stayed at the Workman House and prepared sketches for a chapel contemplated by Workman. On 30 May 1857, the cornerstone to St. Nicholas&#x27;s Chapel (named in honor of Workman&#x27;s wife, Nicolasa Urioste de Valencia) was laid and blessed by Bishop Thaddeus Amat. Construction of the Gothic Revival structure, which measured 24&#x27; x 48&#x27; and featured gilt ceilings and stained glass windows, was completed by the early 1860s. The cemetery was used exclusively as a private burial ground for Workman and Temple family members and friends. and Masses were regularly heard at the chapel, presumably celebrated by a priest visiting from Mission San Gabriel.

After the property, reduced from 24,000 to after the family&#x27;s bank failed in 1876, was lost by the family in 1900, the chapel was said to have burned and was razed, as were three of the original brick enclosure walls. Numerous gravestones were removed and the site desecrated. A lawsuit by Walter Temple, Workman&#x27;s grandson, in 1907 halted the destruction, but the cemetery languished for a decade until Temple, newly enriched with oil revenue from his Montebello ranch, bought the ranch and cemetery. From 1919 to 1921, Temple&#x27;s first priority on the ranch was the renovation of &quot;El Campo Santo&quot; and the building of a mausoleum, designed by the architectural firm of Garstang and Rea, on the site of the chapel. The reopening of the cemetery took place in April 1921, at which time the remains of the last governor of Alta California, Pío Pico, and his wife, Ygnacia Alvarado, were placed in the mausoleum. It also contains the remains of other prominent pioneer families. The Workman Home And Family Cemetery are designated California Historical Landmark No. 874.

The cemetery remained in use during the occupancy of the Temple family in the 1920s and during that of the Brown family from 1940 to 1981. In recent years there have been three burials. Walter P. Temple was relocated to the site in 2002 from Mission San Gabriel, where he was buried in 1938 after the cemetery&#x27;s owner, California Bank, refused the Temples&#x27; request to have him buried there. Temple&#x27;s son, Walter Jr., the last member of the family to have lived at the Homestead, and daughter-in-law, Nellie Didier, were buried in the cemetery in 1998. A spot is reserved for their daughter, after which the cemetery will cease being in active use.

==Public access to the Homestead Museum==
The museum, opened 1 May 1981, is owned and fully funded by the City of Industry and its management is currently contracted to Historical Resources, Inc., owned by museum director Paul R. Spitzzeri. Guided public tours of the Workman Home, &quot; &#x27;La Casa Nueva&#x27; &quot;, and &quot;El Campo Santo&quot; Cemetery at the Homestead Museum are available on the hour from 1 to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday, excepting major holidays. The museum also maintains a full schedule of festivals, weekend living history tours, behind-the-scenes tours, workshops and other events throughout the year.

==California Historic Landmark Marker==
California Historic Landmark Marker on the site reads:
*&quot;NO. 874 WORKMAN HOME AND FAMILY CEMETERY - William Workman and John Rowland organized the first wagon train of permanent eastern settlers, which arrived in Southern California on November 5, 1841.

He also established &#x27;El Campo Santo,&#x27; this region&#x27;s earliest known private family cemetery, in 1850, the miniature Classic Grecian mausoleum was built in 1919 by grandson Walter P. Temple.&quot;

<doc id="489771" wikidata="Q7419520" url="?curid=489771" title="Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area">
<text>The Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area is a county park located in Irwindale, California, US, in the San Gabriel Valley, inside the Santa Fe Dam. The park and dam are nestled among gravel quarries in the area, many of which are currently inactive. The dam is a flood-control dam on the San Gabriel River. The dam functions as a dry dam most of the time. The San Gabriels produce more gravel than most other mountains. The park is maintained and operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. The park, located off the San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605), contains a 70-acre (280,000 m2) lake for year-round fishing and non motorized watercraft.

The dam is a popular tourist attraction, most likely due to the views of the San Gabriel Mountains. Recreational activities at the park include seasonal swimming, fishing, non-motorized boating, cycling, birdwatching, and hiking. In 2005, the annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California was relocated to the park from its long-established location at the Glen Helen Regional Park in Devore, California. The San Gabriel River Bike Trail runs through the recreation area. The bike path traces the rim of the dam around to the east of the flood basin and park, with access at Azusa Canyon Drive (main entrance to park)

Fish found in the lake include largemouth bass, bluegills, crappie, and carp. Rainbow trout are stocked in the cooler months, and channel catfish are stocked in the summer months. Some of the rare plants and wildlife found in the river fan include the alluvial fan sage scrub, cactus wrens, California gnatcatchers, scissor-tail flycatchers, horned lizards, and kangaroo rats. 

==Santa Fe Dam Nature Center==
The focus of the Santa Fe Dam Nature Center is the plant life and wildlife of the alluvial fan of the San Gabriel River. The nature center is open Saturdays from 10 AM to 1 PM, and is operated by the San Gabriel Mountains Regional Conservancy. Programs include nature and bird walks, nature hobby presentations, insect identification, Tongva cultural history and other special programs.

<doc id="489773" wikidata="Q6025098" url="?curid=489773" title="Indirect effect">
<text>Indirect effect is a principle of the European Union (EU) law, whereby national courts of the member states of the EU are required to interpret national law in line with provisions of EU law. The principle of indirect effect contrasts with the principle of direct effect, which, under certain conditions, allows individuals to invoke the EU law itself before national courts. 

The indirect effect arises from the failure of a member state to implement a directiveeither correctly or at allbut where the direct effect cannot apply because the party against whom the directive is sought to be enforced is a private entity or otherwise fails to meet the conditions which would give the directive direct effect. In &quot;Von Colson and Kamann v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen&quot;, the ECJ ruled that national courts should interpret national law in line with the directive, &quot;in so far as it is given the discretion to do so under national law&quot;. While &quot;Von Colson&quot; dealt with a situation where a member state had failed to implement a directive correctly, in &quot;Marleasing v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion&quot; the ECJ extended indirect effect to situations where the member state concerned had not implemented the directive at all.

While the indirect effect is of great importance especially in relation to directives, recommendations and opinions could have indirect effect as well. Recommendations and opinions have no binding force, like directives have. However, in &quot;Grimaldi v Fonds des Maladies Professionnelles&quot; the ECJ has ruled that since recommendations and opinions must have some legal effect, they should be taken into consideration when dealing with measures that the two were supposed to supplement.

<text>Sir William Mark Tully, KBE (born 24 October 1935) is a British journalist and the former Bureau Chief of BBC, New Delhi, a position he held for 20 years. He worked with the BBC for 30 years before resigning in July 1994. The recipient of several awards, Tully has authored nine books. He is a member of the Oriental Club.

==Journalistic career==
Tully joined the BBC in 1964 and moved back to India in 1965 to work as the corporation&#x27;s India Correspondent. He covered all the major incidents in South Asia during his tenure, ranging from Indo-Pakistan conflicts, Bhopal gas tragedy, Operation Blue Star (and the subsequent assassination of Indira Gandhi, anti-Sikh riots), Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi to the Demolition of Babri Masjid. He was barred from entering India during Emergency in 1975–77 when Prime Minister Mrs Gandhi had imposed censorship curbs on the media.

Tully resigned from the BBC in July 1994, after an argument with John Birt, the then Director General. He accused Birt of &quot;running the corporation by fear&quot; and &quot;turning the BBC into a secretive monolith with poor ratings and a demoralised staff&quot;.
In 1994 he presented an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Great Railway Journeys&quot;, &quot;Karachi to The Khyber Pass&quot;, travelling by train across Pakistan. As a well-known railway enthusiast, he also presented &quot;Steam&#x27;s Indian Summer&quot;, an episode of the &quot;World Steam Classics&quot; series, produced by Nick Lera. Since 1994, he has been working as a freelance journalist and broadcaster based in New Delhi.
He was the regular presenter of the weekly BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Something Understood&quot; until the BBC announced its cessation in 2019.

As a guest of the Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue on 7 October 2010 he spoke on &quot;How certain should we be? The problem of religious pluralism&quot;. He described his experiences and the fact that India had historically been home to all the world&#x27;s major religions.
He said that had taught him that there are many ways to God.

Tully is patron of the British branch of Child in Need India (CINI UK).
Tully is equally well versed in English and Hindi. He had contributed his heartfelt efforts to keep literature alive and had been key speaker among 50 speakers of second Kalinga Literary Festival on 17 May 2015, where he explored the role of literature in nation building.

==Awards and honours==
Tully was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1985 and was awarded the Padma Shri in 1992. He was knighted in the New Year Honours 2002, receiving a KBE, and in 2005 he received the Padma Bhushan. BAFTA in 1985 for lifelong achievement.
He was conferred the coveted RedInk Lifetime Achievement Award of the Mumbai Press Club

==Books==
Tully&#x27;s first book on India &quot;Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi&#x27;s Last Battle&quot; (1985) was co-authored with his colleague at BBC Delhi, Satish Jacob; the book dealt with the events leading up to Operation Blue Star, Indian military action carried out between 1 and 8 June 1984 to remove militant religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) complex in Amritsar, Punjab.

His next book &quot;Raj to Rajiv: 40 Years of Indian Independence&quot; was written with Zareer Masani, and was based on a BBC radio series of the same name. In the US, this book was published under the title &quot;India: Forty Years of Independence&quot;.

Tully&#x27;s &quot;No Full Stops in India&quot; (1988), a collection of journalistic essays, was published in the US as &quot;The Defeat of a Congress-man&quot;. The Independent wrote that &quot;Tully&#x27;s profound knowledge and sympathy .. unravels a few of the more bewildering and enchanting mysteries of the subcontinent.&quot;

Tully&#x27;s only work of fiction, &quot;The Heart of India&quot;, was published in 1995.

In 2002 came &quot;India in Slow Motion&quot;, written in collaboration with Gillian Wright and published by Viking. Reviewing the book in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Michael Holland wrote of Tully that &quot;Few foreigners manage to get under the skin of the world&#x27;s biggest democracy the way he does, and fewer still can write about it with the clarity and insight he brings to all his work.&quot;

Tully later wrote &quot;India&#x27;s Unending Journey&quot; (2008) and &quot;India: The Road Ahead&quot; (2011), published in India under the title &quot;Non-Stop India&quot;.

In the area of religion, Tully has written &quot;An Investigation into The Lives of Jesus&quot; (1996) to accompany the BBC series of the same name, and &quot;Mother&quot; (1992) on Mother Teresa.

The anonymously authored &quot;Hindutva Sex and Adventure&quot; is a novel featuring a main character with strong similarities to Tully. Tully himself has stated that &quot;I am amazed that Roli Books should publish such thinly disguised plagiarism, and allow the author to hide in a cavalier manner behind a &quot;nom-de-plume&quot;. The book is clearly modelled on my career, even down to the name of the main character. That character&#x27;s journalism is abysmal, and his views on Hindutva and Hinduism do not in any way reflect mine. I would disagree with them profoundly&quot;.

His latest book &quot;Upcountry Tales: Once Upon A Time In The Heart Of India&quot; (2017) is a collection of short stories set in rural north India.

==Personal life==
Tully was born in Tollygunge in India His father was a British businessman who was a partner in one of the leading managing agencies of the British Raj. He spent the first decade of his childhood in India, although without being allowed to socialise with Indian people; at the age of four, he was sent to a &quot;British boarding school&quot; in Darjeeling, before going to England for further schooling from the age of nine. There he was educated at Twyford School (Hampshire), Marlborough College and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he studied Theology.

After Cambridge, Tully intended to become a priest in the Church of England but abandoned the vocation after just two terms at Lincoln Theological College, admitting later that he had doubts about &quot;trusting [his] sexuality to behave as a Christian priest&quot;. In 2001 he married Margaret, with whom he has four children in London. When in India, however, he lives with his girlfriend Gillian Wright. Tully also holds an Overseas Citizenship of India card.

<text>Voronezh State University (, ВГУ; VSU) is one of the main universities in Central Russia, located in the city of Voronezh. The university was established in 1918 by professors evacuated from the University of Tartu in Estonia. The university has 18 faculties and an enrollment of 22,000 students from Russia, Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia. Besides, the university has 6 research institutes and 16 research laboratories administered by the Russian Academy of Science. The university is composed of 10 buildings and 7 resident halls situated throughout the city. For over 90 years the University has trained more than 100,000 professionals.

==Sanctions==
Dmitry Yendovitsky (Ендовицкий Дмитрий Александрович), the rector of the Voronezh State University has signed a letter of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==History==
In 1802 following a decree of Russian Emperor Alexander I the University of Tartu in Estonia was re-established. As a result of the German occupation of Estonia during World War I in March 1918, Russian students and professors had to leave the Estonian territory for their own safety. It was decided that a new university would be established in central Russia. In July and September 1918 from Dorpat (now Tartu), 39 professors, 45 lecturers, 43 staff and about 800 students arrived in Voronezh. The first rector of the university was Basil E. Regel.

On 12 November 1918 four faculties started working, namely the faculty of Medicine, the faculty of Physics and Mathematics, the faculty of History and Philology and the Law faculty. In the beginning of 1919, the University had an enrollment of 10,000 students. Anyone could study there, only 4 years later in 1923 that entrance exams were introduced. In 1920, after the Treaty of Tartu, the properties of the University of Tartu (libraries, archives, manuals, documents and other objects) were returned to Estonia. However, most of the teachers who have left due to the onset of the army of Imperial Germany and the occupation of Estonia, did not return to Estonia.

In the early 1920s, Voronezh Institute of Education was added to the university, which marked the beginning of pedagogical faculties, departments that prepares teachers of mathematics, physics, chemistry, natural science, Russian language and literature, social and economic disciplines for schools. In 1930, the Medical Faculty was transformed into an independent institute. During World War II the university was relocated in Yelabuga in the Republic of Tatarstan for a period of two years from 1941 to 1943.

<doc id="489780" wikidata="Q7283092" url="?curid=489780" title="Raging Waters">
<text>Raging Waters is a chain of two water theme parks in San Dimas, California, and Sydney, Australia. The parks are operated by Palace Entertainment and owned by its parent company Parques Reunidos, yet, they each contain different attractions. The parks are generally closed during the winter season.

==Raging Waters Los Angeles==
Raging Waters Los Angeles opened June 18, 1983, located in Los Angeles County in the city of San Dimas, near SR 57 between Interstate 10 and Interstate 210. At 60 acres, park management described it as California&#x27;s largest waterpark (2011). The park was formerly known as &quot;Raging Waters San Dimas&quot; but, as of 2016, official media was using the name &quot;Raging Waters Los Angeles&quot; for this location. The park inspired the waterpark scenes in the 1989 movie &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;.

===Attractions===
Aqua Rocket is a ProSlide Hydro Magnetic slide that uses magnetic propulsion to propel a raft up hills.

Amazon Adventure is a quarter-mile-long, , tropical river that runs through a section of the park. Riders sit in rafts as the current pulls them around the river route.

Bermuda Triangle consists of three twisting, turning tunnels that recycle more than 2,500 gallons of water per minute, and make riders feel like they have ‘entered’ the Bermuda Triangle.

Bombs Away are two WhiteWater trapdoor slides, one with an open free-fall drop, and the other with an enclosed loop; opened in 2023.

Dark Hole is a system of two tunnel water slides with a drop of 52 feet. Riders formerly had to sit in a single-person raft (identical to the ones used in Amazon River), but as of 2016, riders sit in a two-person raft, speeding through total darkness. This attraction was the first of its kind in the country. Riders travel at a speed of 26 miles per hour.

Dr. Von Dark&#x27;s Tunnel of Terror is a ProSlide Trantrum slide in which riders experience a 40-foot drop into a dark tunnel. Riders will then drop into a small mini-funnel.

Dragon&#x27;s Den is a slide which debuted in 2004, and is a two-person tube-ride that sends guests plummeting down a steep tunnel, circling around a bowl until they fall through a secret tunnel at the bottom. As of 2016, Dragon&#x27;s Den is also ridden as a single-rider attraction, with tubes identical to the ones used in Amazon River.

High Extreme is the name of two 600-foot-long (180 m) mat slides that reach speeds of up to 35 miles an hour (56 km/h).

Kid&#x27;s Kingdom is a small kids’ water playground with 4 small water slides.

Little Dipper Lagoon is a kids’ splash area with a few small water slides for toddlers and very young kids.

Neptune’s Fury is a 600-foot (180 m) long, pitch-black raft slide which can hold up to 4 people.

Ragin’ Racer is a ProSlide 8-lane mat racer slide where riders experience multiple drops before a splash-down.

Speed Slides are high speed body slides called Raging Rocket and Screamer.

Splash Island Adventure is an SCS Interactive water playground with 4 water slides, a 1,000-gallon tipping bucket, and more than 75 interactive water features.

Thunder Rapids is a five-person family raft slide that is open-air.

Volcano Fantasea is a small volcano themed kids area.

Wave Cove is a wave pool that produces 3-foot-tall waves every 12 minutes.

== Raging Waters Sydney ==
Raging Waters Sydney is located in Greater Western Sydney, and was formerly known as Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild until being acquired in 2018 by Parques Reunidos.
== Former parks ==
=== Sacramento ===
Raging Waters Sacramento is located at Cal Expo and was formerly known as Six Flags Waterworld. Palace Entertainment would terminate their lease on November 8, 2022 &quot;after a careful review of company priorities&quot;. In 2023, Silverwood Entertainment took over the park and announced a 3-year plan to completely refurbish the park. The park will reopen in 2025 under the name &quot;Calibunga&quot; and will include a year-round restaurant named &quot;Cal Soleil&quot;, as well as a Chuck E. Cheese themed area.

=== San Jose ===
Raging Waters San Jose was located in Lake Cunningham Park in East San Jose, adjacent to Capitol Expressway, Eastridge Mall, Eastridge Transit Center and Reid-Hillview Airport. The park opened to the public in 1985, and was the largest water park in Northern California. On September 6, 2023, it was announced via Raging Waters San Jose&#x27;s social media that the park would not be reopening for the 2024 season.

On May 10, 2024, it was announced that the lease for the site was acquired by California Dreamin&#x27; Entertainment, a subsidiary of Silverwood Entertainment Holdings LLC, and that the water park will reopen as CaliBunga Waterpark. 

The park reopened on July 4th, five days after the original planned opening date of June 29th.

=== Salt Lake City ===
Until early 2011, there was also a Raging Waters park in Salt Lake City, Utah, later operated as Seven Peaks Salt Lake. The Raging Waters/Seven Peaks park in Salt Lake City would close down in 2018 with the site being demolished in 2021.

<doc id="489783" wikidata="Q1343274" url="?curid=489783" title="Cinema of Mexico">
<text>The cinema of Mexico dates to the late nineteenth century during the rule of President Porfirio Díaz. Seeing a demonstration of short films in 1896, Díaz immediately saw the importance of documenting his presidency in order to present an ideal image of it. With the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, Mexican and foreign makers of silent films seized the opportunity to document its leaders and events. From 1915 onward, Mexican cinema focused on narrative film.

During the Golden Age of Mexican cinema from 1936 to 1956, Mexico all but dominated the Latin American film industry.

In 2019, &quot;Roma&quot; became the first Mexican film and fourth Latin American film to win the Oscar for best foreign language film. Roma also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film at the 72nd British Academy Film Awards.

Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández was rumored to be the model for the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. According to the legend, in 1928 MGM&#x27;s art director Cedric Gibbons, one of the original Motion Picture Academy members, was tasked with creating the Academy Award trophy. In need of a model for his statuette, Gibbons was introduced by his future wife, actress Dolores del Río, to Fernández. Reportedly, Fernández had to be persuaded to pose nude for what is today known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;.

==History==

===1896–1911: Silent films; the Porfiriato===
Shortly after the first moving picture was viewed in 1895 using Thomas Edison&#x27;s kinetoscope and the invention of the cinematographe projector by Auguste Lumière, Mexicans began queuing in cinemas in the capital to see international one-minute films such as &quot;The Card Players&quot;, &quot;Arrival of a Train&quot;, and &quot;The Magic Hat&quot;. The cinematograph arrived to Mexico seven months after its first projection in France, brought in by Claude Ferdinand Bon Bernard and Gabriel Veyre (the latter had been contracted by the Lumierè brothers to spread the cinematograph across México, Venezuela, the Guaianas and the Antilles). Mexico entered production in the silent film industry with several movies, but many of the films up to the 1920s have been lost and were not well documented.

Film in México continued to expand quickly after its arrival in Mexico. On 6 August 1896, President Porfirio Díaz invited Bon Bernard and Veyre to his residence at Chapultepec Castle, and eight days later, the first projection for the press was made in what is now Madero Street. This projection included films by the Lumierè brothers such as L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un train en gare de La Ciotat, and on 15 August, a projection was made for the general public.

President Díaz recognized the importance of cinema and appeared in many films placing him at the center of action with his cabinet ministers; in a parade; and in the zócalo. In 1906, he is seen in &quot;La entrevista de los presidentes Díaz-Taft&quot;, the first-ever meeting of a U.S. president with Mexico&#x27;s, one of the first filmed reportages produced in Mexico. It was filmed by the Alva brothers. The first fiction film to be created in Mexico was based on a recreation of the duel between two deputies, called &quot;Duelo a pistola en el bosque de Chapultepec&quot; (Gun duel in the Chapultepec forest).

Mexican cinema continued to become more available across the country, thanks in part to businessmen such as Guillermo Becerril, Carlos Mongrand and Salvador Toscano. The origin of early Mexican film-making is generally associated with Salvador Toscano Barragán, who introduced the filmed reportage. In 1898 Toscano made the country&#x27;s first film with a plot, titled &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot;. During the Mexican Revolution, Toscano recorded several clips of the battles, which would become a full-length documentary in 1950 under the title &quot;Memories of a Mexican&quot;, assembled by his daughter. Other short films were either created or influenced from French film-makers.

By 1906, 16 movie theaters opened their doors to accommodate the popularity of cinema in Mexico City. &quot;Carpas&quot;, or tent shows, were popular beginning in 1911 where lower-class citizens would perform picaresque humor and theatrical plays, a place for training for aspiring actors. Politically affiliated films appeared in 1908; these would be deemed propagandistic by today&#x27;s standards. Significant battles were filmed and broadcast during the Revolution, which fueled Mexicans&#x27; excitement in cinema. In addition, the first intents to formalize the Mexican cinematic industry were made between 1905 and 1906, with the creation of the first Mexican distributing companies. Some of the most important companies were Empresa Cinematográfica Mexicana, American Amusement Company, Compañía Explotadora de Cinematógrafos and Unión Cinematográfica.

===1911–1917: The Mexican Revolution===
The popularity that cinema had experienced in the early 20th century continued to grow, and by 1911 fourteen new movie houses were built. During this period documentary techniques were mastered, as is evident in the Alva brothers&#x27; production entitled &quot;Revolución orozquista&quot; (1912). The film was shot in the camps of the rebel and federal forces during the battle between General Victoriano Huerta and the rebel leader Pascual Orozco.

The rise of cinema plateaued due to the lack of distributors and the difficulty to make new material. This in addition to the dangers that the inflammability of film resulted in the closing of many of the &quot;Carpas&quot;. The cinematic industry was reduced to small companies, with Carlos Mongrand standing out because of films such as Desfiles de tropas en San Luis Potosí, Carnaval de Mérida and Aventuras del sexteto Uranga.

Despite the relative advancement of cinema during this period, the moralistic and paternalist ideology of President Madero led to his campaign to save the lower classes from immorality through censorship. In late September and early October 1911, city council members appointed additional movie house inspectors, whose wages would be paid by the exhibitioners. Furthermore, the head of the Entertainment Commission, proposed the implementation of censorship; however, Victoriano Huerta&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in the Ten Tragic Days of February 1913 prevented the move to legislate censorship.

Although Huerta&#x27;s rule was brief, from February 1913 to July 1914, Mexican cinema experienced significant changes within this period such as the further establishment of censorship and a shift away from documentary films to entertainment films. The Alva brothers&#x27; production of &quot;Aniversario del fallecimineto de la suegra de Enhart&quot; (&quot;Anniversary of the Death of Enhart&#x27;s Mother-in-Law&quot;) is indicative of the change in the aim of Mexican cinematographers. The Alva brothers produced films such as &quot;La entrada de Madero a la capital&quot; (&quot;Entry of Madero in the Capital) with the use of Indalecio Noriega Colombres&#x27;s inventions, which allowed for a phonograph to be synchronized with the images projected.

In regards to censorship, the Huerta government imposed a moral and political decree of censorship in approximately June 1913. This decree was imposed a few days after &quot;convencionista&quot; soldiers shot at the screen during a viewing of &quot;El aguila y la serpiente&quot;. The decree stated that films that showed the following were prohibited: &quot;views representing crimes, if they do not include punishment of the guilty parties, views which directly or indirectly insult an authority or person, morality or good manners, provoke a crime or offence, or in any way disturb the public order (Mora 70).&quot;

As a result of the limitations placed on film content as well as the radicalization of the parties involved in the armed conflicts, cameramen and producers began to display their opinion through the films they produced. For instance, favoritism towards the Zapatistas was illustrated in the film &quot;Sangre Hermana&quot; (Sister Blood, 1914). Due to the sensational content of this film, it is evident that the producers had no interest in displaying the events in such a way that the audience could come to their own conclusions.

===1917–1936: Post-revolutionary film making and first sound film===

The cinematic productions of this period were reflective of the Italians style &quot;film d&#x27;art&quot;, which were fiction-based melodramas. The film &quot;La Luz&quot; (The Light, Ezequiel Carrasco, 1917, starring Emma Padilla) was the first film that attempted to adopt this style, even though it was viewed as a plagiarism of Piero Fosco&#x27;s &quot;Il Fuoco&quot;. Paranaguá attributes the influence that the Italian had on the Mexican cinema with the similarities between the situations of both countries. Both countries were in a state of chaos and disorder – there was a war in Italy and a revolution in Mexico (Paranaguá 70). Once again censorship was re-established on October 1, 1919. Films which illustrated acts of immortality or induced sympathy for the criminal were prohibited.

In 1917, the former vaudeville star Mimí Derba, founded the Azteca Studios, which produced notable films between 1917 and 1923. The most successful of these was &quot;En defensa Propia&quot; (1921).

Government budget had to be trimmed as a result of the rebellion and cinematographic departments of the Ministry of Education and Agriculture were cut. By 1924, narrative films were at an all-time low since 1917.

During the 1920s very few movies were produced, given the political climate that was still very unsettled and the resurgence of the American film industry after World War I. Notable Mexican movie stars moved to the United States. Stars such as Ramón Novarro, Dolores del Río and Lupe Vélez, became principal stars of notable Hollywood films in the 1920s and 30s. Other Mexican stars appeared in numerous movies which were merely Spanish-language versions of Hollywood movies.

In 1994, the Mexican magazine &quot;Somos&quot; published a list of &quot;The 100 best movies of the cinema of Mexico&quot; in its 100th edition. The oldest film selected was &quot;El automóvil gris&quot; (). To make the selection, the magazine invited 25 specialists in Mexican cinematography, among which critics stand out Jorge Ayala Blanco, Nelson Carro and Tomás Pérez Turrent, the historians Eduardo de la Vega Alfaro and Gustavo García Gutiérrez. The top twelve films in order chosen from the best and on are Let&#x27;s Go with Pancho Villa, Los Olvidados, Godfather Mendoza, Aventurera, A Family Like Many Others, Nazarín, El, The Woman of the Port, The Place Without Limits, Here&#x27;s the Point, Champion Without a Crown, and Enamorada.

In the 1930s, once peace and a degree of political stability were achieved, the film industry took off in Mexico and several movies still experimenting with the new medium were made. Hollywood&#x27;s attempt at creating Spanish language films for Latin America failed mainly due to the combination of Hispanic actors from different ethnicities exhibiting various accents unfamiliar to the Mexican people. Early Mexican cinematographers were influenced and encouraged by Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s visit to the country in 1930.

In 1931 the first Mexican &quot;talkie&quot; movie, an adaptation of the Federico Gamboa&#x27;s novel &quot;Santa&quot;, directed by Antonio Moreno and starred by the Mexican-Hollywood star Lupita Tovar, was realized. Until Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;¡Que viva México!&quot; (1931), Mexican audiences were exposed to popular melodramas, crude comedies, as well as Spanish-language versions of Hollywood movies.

Eisenstein&#x27;s visit to Mexico inspired directors like Emilio Fernández and cameraman Gabriel Figueroa, and the number of Mexican-made films increased and improved. During the 1930s the Mexican film industry achieved considerable success with movies like &quot;La Mujer del Puerto&quot; (1934), Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;Redes&quot; (1934), &quot;Janitzio&quot; (1934), and &quot;Dos Monjes&quot; (1934). 

===1936–1956: The Golden Age===

The &quot;Golden Age of Mexican cinema&quot; began in 1936 with the premiere of &quot;Allá en el Rancho Grande&quot;, and ended in 1956.

During the 1940s the full potential of the industry developed. Actors and directors became popular icons and even figures with political influence on diverse spheres of Mexican life. The industry received a boost as a consequence of Hollywood redirecting its efforts towards propagandistic films and European countries focusing on World War II, which left an open field for other industries.

Mexico dominated the film market in Latin America for most of the 1940s without competition from the United States film industry. During World War II, movie production in Mexico tripled. The fact that Argentina and Spain had fascist governments made the Mexican movie industry the world&#x27;s largest producer of Spanish-language films in the 1940. Although the Mexican government was reactionary, it encouraged the production of films that would help articulate a true Mexican identity, in contrast to the view often seen in Hollywood movies. In the late 1940s and 50s, the government become more involved in promoting distribution of films.

The Golden Age of Mexican cinema took place during the 1940s and beyond. The most prominent actor during this period was Mario Moreno, better known as Cantinflas. The film &quot;Ahí está el detalle&quot; in 1940 made Cantinflas a household name and he became known as the &quot;Mexican Charlie Chaplin&quot;. His films were ubiquitous in Spain and Latin America and influenced many contemporary actors. Not until the appearance of &quot;Tin-Tan&quot; in the late 1940s did his popularity wane.

Mexican actresses also were a focus in Mexican cinema. Sara García was the &quot;grandmother of Mexico&quot;. Her career began with silent films in 1910, moved to theatre, and ultimately the film that made her famous, &quot;No basta ser madre&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Not Enough to be a Mother&quot;) in 1937. Dolores del Río, another dramatic actress, became well known after her Hollywood career in the 1930s and for her roles in a couple of films directed by Emilio Fernández.

Stock characters also began to form during the Golden Age. The charro, plead, and the poor peasant are common characters throughout many films.

María Félix (well known as &quot;La Doña&quot;), was a big star after her role in the movie &quot;Doña Bárbara&quot; in 1943. She gained a higher popularity in European countries.

In 1943, the Mexican industry produced seventy films, the most for a Spanish speaking country. Two notable films released in 1943 by director Emilio Fernández were &quot;Flor silvestre&quot; (1942) and &quot;María Candelaria&quot; (1944), both films starring prestigious Hollywood actress Dolores del Río. The movies were triumphs for the director and for internationally acclaimed cinematographer, Gabriel Figueroa especially with &quot;María Candelaria&quot; winning the top prize at the Cannes Festival. Other celebrated Fernández films were &quot;La perla&quot; (1945), &quot;Enamorada&quot; (1946), the American-Mexican production &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1947), directed with John Ford, &quot;Río Escondido&quot; (1947), &quot;La Malquerida&quot; (1949) and &quot;Pueblerina&quot; (1949).

In 1948 there was another &quot;first&quot; for Mexican cinema: The trilogy of &quot;Nosotros los Pobres&quot;, &quot;Ustedes los ricos&quot; and &quot;Pepe el Toro&quot;, starring Mexican icons Pedro Infante and Evita Muñoz (&quot;Chachita&quot;) and directed by Ismael Rodríguez.

The only other comedian with the same level of popularity as Cantinflas was German Valdez &quot;Tin-Tan&quot;. Tin-Tan played a &quot;pachuco&quot; character appearing with a zoot suit in his films. Unlike Cantinflas, Tin-Tan never played as a &quot;pelado&quot;, but as a Mexican-American. He employed pachuco slang in many of his movies and frequently used Spanglish, a dialect that many Mexican residents disdained.

In the middle of the 1940s, the Spanish director Juan Orol started the production of films with Cuban and Mexican dancers. This cinematographic genre was named &quot;Rumberas film&quot;, and was very popular with the Latin American audiences. The stars of this exotic genre were María Antonieta Pons, Meche Barba, Ninón Sevilla, Amalia Aguilar and Rosa Carmina.

Other relevant films during these years include &quot;Espaldas mojadas&quot; (&quot;Wetbacks&quot;) by Alejandro Galindo, &quot;Aventurera&quot; a melodrama starred by Ninón Sevilla, &quot;Dos tipos de cuidado&quot; (1951), &quot;El Rebozo de Soledad&quot; (1952) and &quot;Los Olvidados&quot; (&quot;The Young and the Damned&quot;) (1950), a story about impoverished children in Mexico City directed by the Mexican of Spanish ascendent director Luis Buñuel, a very important figure in the course of the Mexican Cinema of the 1940s and 1950s. Some of the most important Buñuel&#x27;s films in his Mexican period are &quot;Subida al cielo&quot; (1952), &quot;Él&quot; (1953), and &quot;Ensayo de un crimen&quot; (1955). 

The themes during those years, although mostly conventional comedies or dramas, touched all aspects of Mexican society, from the 19th century dictator Porfirio Díaz and his court, to love stories always tainted by drama.

===1960s through 1980s===
See: Luchador films, Ficheras films
During the 1960s and 1970s many cult horror and action movies were produced with professional wrestler El Santo among others.
Luis Buñuel released his last Mexican films: &quot;El ángel exterminador&quot; (1962) and &quot;Simón del desierto&quot; (1965).
In the late 1960s and early 1970s the work of notable Mexican young directors flourished: Arturo Ripstein (&quot;El castillo de la pureza&quot;–1972; &quot;El lugar sin límites&quot;–1977), Luis Alcoriza (&quot;Tarahumara&quot;–1965; &quot;Fé, Esperanza y Caridad&quot;–1973), Felipe Cazals (&quot;Las poquianchis&quot;–1976–; &quot;El Apando&quot;–1976), Jorge Fons (&quot;los cachorros&quot;–1973–; &quot;Rojo Amanecer&quot; −1989), Paul Leduc (&quot;Reed, Mexico insurgente&quot; −1972-; &quot;Frida, Naturaleza Viva&quot;), Alejandro Jodorowski (&quot;El topo&quot;– 1970–; &quot;Santa Sangre&quot;–1989), the Chilean Miguel Littin (&quot;Letters from Marusia&quot;–1976), Jaime Humberto Hermosillo (&quot;La pasión según Berenice&quot;–1972–; &quot;Doña Herlinda y su hijo&quot;–1984) and many others. His films represented Mexico in notable international film festivals.
American directors as John Huston realized some Mexican-set English language films (e.g., &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;–1984).

What is now Videocine was established in 1979 as Televicine by Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, whose family founded Televisa, with which Videocine is co-owned. The company became the largest producer and distributor of theatrical movies in Mexico and remains such today. By the time of Videocine&#x27;s establishment, it had become the norm for a Mexican movie to reach its largest post-theatrical audience through television carriage rights with any of the Televisa networks.

The 1961 film &quot;The Important Man&quot; (original title &quot;Animas Trujano&quot;) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1962. The 1965 film &quot;Always Further On&quot; won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival. The film was also selected as the Mexican entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 38th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. Some films nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Films of the time are the 1960 &quot;Macario&quot;, 1962 &quot;The Pearl of Tlayucan&quot; (original title &quot;Tlayucan&quot;), 1975 &quot;Letters from Marusia&quot; (original title &quot;Actas de Marusia&quot;).

===Nuevo Cine Mexicano (New Mexican Cinema)===

Mexican cinema suffered through the 1960s and 70s, until government sponsorship of the industry and the creation of state supported film helped create Nuevo Cine Mexicano (New Mexican Cinema) in the 1990s. The period spanning the 1990s to the present has been considered as the prime era of the New Mexican Cinema.

It first took place with high quality films by Arturo Ripstein, Alfonso Arau, Alfonso Cuarón, and María Novaro. Among the films produced at this time were &quot;Solo con tu pareja&quot; (1991), &quot;Como agua para chocolate&quot; (&quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;) (1992), &quot;Cronos&quot; (1993), &quot;El callejón de los milagros&quot; (1995), &quot;Profundo carmesí&quot; (1996), &quot;Sexo, pudor y lágrimas&quot; (&quot;Sex, Shame, and Tears&quot;) (1999), &quot;The Other Conquest&quot; (2000), and others such as &quot;La Misma Luna&quot; (2007).

More recent are &quot;Amores perros&quot; by Alejandro González Iñárritu, &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; by Alfonso Cuarón, &quot;El crimen del Padre Amaro&quot; by Carlos Carrera, &quot;Arráncame la vida&quot; by Roberto Sneider, &quot;Biutiful&quot; (2010) (also directed by Iñárritu), &quot;&quot; (2010), &quot;Instructions Not Included&quot; (2013), &quot;Cantinflas&quot; (2014), and the remake of the 1975 Mexican horror film &quot;Más Negro que la Noche&quot; (&quot;Blacker Than Night&quot;) (2014) and also the first 3D film of Mexico.

In the latest years it was noticed the increasing success of a group of Mexicans in Hollywood cinema, specially with directors Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Guillermo del Toro as well as cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. All three directors had won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Director and Lubezki won both prizes for Best Cinematography for three consecutive years. The 3 directors have frequently been cited as the &quot;Three Amigos of Cinema&quot;, while Lubezki&#x27;s innovative style of cinematography made critics often call him one of the greatest directors of photography of all time.

For the other side the success of the films Nosotros los Nobles and Instructions Not Included in 2013, gave way to the development of similar projects trying to focus on the use of known Mexican TV stars such as Omar Chaparro, Adal Ramones or Adrian Uribe. The majority of them are romantic comedies focused on telenovela-style stories.

This, however, should not prevent the success of other directors in the development of dramatic films, such as Carlos Reygadas and Alonso Ruizpalacios.

In 2017, Alfonso Cuaron travelled back to Mexico to film his most intimate film, Roma. While navigating the complexities of film permits in Mexico, the production team worked to authentically recreate the 1970s Mexico City setting. The film, distributed by Netflix went on critical acclaim and was the second Mexican movie to win the Golden Globe as Best Foreign Language Film, while Cuaron got the Best Director award. Also it becomes the first Mexican movie to be nominated to both Best Film and Best Foreign Language Film in the Academy Awards, while getting a total of 10 nominations including Best Actress for mixtec actress Yalitza Aparicio and Best Supporting Actress for Marina de Tavira.

==Mexploitation subgenre==

A Mexican cinema subgenre is the Mexploitation subgenre, itself part of the Mexican action films genre. A second sub-genre within this sub-genre is the narco-filme, films about fictional drug cartels battling the police and each others. During 2019, Bancomext announced the financing of up to 50 percent of the film-making costs of many films, including Mexican action films. Mexican action film stars include the Almada brothers, Fernando and Mario Almada, Jorge Rivero, Rosa Gloria Chagoyán (&quot;Lola la Trailera&quot;), the Dominican Republic-born Andres Garcia, Bernabe Melendrez and Max Hernandez Jr.

===Role of women===

Women filmmakers in Latin America, specifically Mexico suffered from absolute neglect by the film industry and audience. Mimí Derba founded one of the first Mexican production companies, Azteca Films. She had a successful career in vaudeville before entering films. Derba was the first female director in Mexico. Then Matilde Landeta was a Mexican filmmaker and screenwriter, who was the first female to serve in those roles during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. Her films focused on the portrayal of strong, realistic female protagonists in a patriarchal world. Landeta won an Ariel Award in 1957 for Best Original Story for the film &quot;El camino de la vida&quot; which she co-wrote with her brother Eduardo. The film also won the 1957 Golden Ariel, the Silver Ariel Film of Major National Interest and Best Direction and two other awards in 1956 in the Berlin International Film Festival under the name of Alfonso Corona Blake.

Movies in this period often featured strong maternal characters, while maintaining the idea of feminine inferiority to men. This perpetuated the belief that women could only reach the same level of agency as men in the process of aging and becoming a mother or grandmother. This is seen in movies such as &quot;Los tres Garcia&quot; (1947) and &quot;Lupe Balazos&quot; (1964). In much of the cinema of this time, women were depicted as being dependent on men for protection and fulfillment. This mirrored much of the cultural sentiment prior to the 1960s.

Many of the female characters in these films were powerless. Not only inferior to male characters, they were easily put down by communities as a whole and easily shunned. A prime example of this story is in &quot;María Candelaria&quot; (1944). In this specific film, María was an innocent character who was shamed for the reputation of another character. A miscommunication occurred that cost her her life. This is a common pattern in Cinema of Mexico at this time because of the belittlement of women.

In the 1980s and 90s, things started to take a turn. Women filmmakers in Mexico finally got the opportunity to create and produce professional feature films. The most popular two would be &quot;El secreto de Romeila&quot; (1988) directed by Busi Cortés and &quot;Los pasos de Ana&quot; (1990) by Marisa Sistach. These two feature films were considered the doors that opened opportunity for women filmmakers in Mexico as well as created a new genre that people were not familiar with, labeled as &#x27;women&#x27;s cinema&#x27;. The phenomenal growth of &#x27;women&#x27;s cinema&#x27;, not only meant that there would be an infinite expansion in the list of female names as filmmakers or creators; in reality, it created a daunting cinematic genre by objectifying women as well as displacing them within the film industry.

Most of the female filmmakers in Mexico identify as feminists. The primary reason for many of them to commit to being filmmakers was to depict stories of women in their original and true essence as well as to strive in readapting roles of females on the Mexican screen. According to Patricia Torres San Martín, an honorable film scholar, there is a new theme emerging within the film industry in Mexico which is known as the &#x27;new female identity&#x27;. This new structural change in cinema created a geographical cultural change in Mexico due to its new emerged eye-opening concept in the film industry. One of Maria Novaro first short films (a school work: &quot;An Island Surrounded by Water&quot;, 1984) was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York for its permanent film collection and was distributed in the United States by Women Make Movies. Maria&#x27;s 1994 &quot;El Jardín del Edén&quot; () obtain her a second nomination for the Ariel Award for Best Picture the first for a woman in Mexico. In the Garden of Eden, three very different women find themselves in the Mexican-American border town of Tijuana, each with her own goal. The women: struggling artist Elizabeth (Rosario Sagrav), Jane (Renée Coleman), who&#x27;s looking for her brother, and Serena (Gabriela Roel), a widow who just arrived in town with her family. Although the trio come from different cultural backgrounds—Serena is Mexican, Jane is American and Elizabeth is Mexican-American—all three are similarly in search of a new direction.

Mariana Chenillo became the first female director to win an Ariel Award for Best Picture back in 2010 for the film Nora&#x27;s Will. The Ariel is the Mexican Academy of Film Award. In cinema, it is considered Mexico&#x27;s equivalent to the Academy Awards (&quot;Oscars&quot;) of the United States. The film gives a mysterious photograph left under the bed will lead to an unexpected outcome which will remind us that sometimes the greatest love stories are hidden in the smallest places. Issa López wrote the scripts for several film features, three of them produced in Mexico by the Major Hollywood Studios, and two of those directed by herself; &quot;Efectos Secundarios&quot; (Warner Bros., 2006) and &quot;Casi Divas&quot; Almost Divas (Sony Pictures, 2008). Casi Divas is the only Mexican movie to be scored by acclaimed Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer. Makes her a Mexican filmmaker, one to watch.

<doc id="489787" wikidata="Q6014615" url="?curid=489787" title="Incidental effect">
<text>Incidental effect is a concept in European Union law that allows the use of indirect effect of EU directives in private legal actions. While an individual cannot be sued for failure to comply with an EU directive, the state&#x27;s failure to comply can be an incidental factor in a suit against an individual, where it will not impose legal obligations upon them.

The concept was defined by the European Court of Justice in Case C-194/94 &quot;CIA Security International SA v. Signalson SA and Securitel Sprl&quot;. CIA had attempted to market a burglar alarm in Belgium that was not compatible with Belgian technical specifications. However, the Belgian government had failed to report these specifications to the EU, as required by a directive in 1983. The court ruled that this constituted a substantial degradation of the effectiveness of the directive, which was intended to lower barriers to trade, and that the Belgian government&#x27;s breach of the directive made the Belgian law inapplicable to individuals.

This concept was especially important in the field of contracts. The Court of Justice stated that a substantial procedural defect in implementing a directive could nullify a national law in the context of a contract, and gave national courts the power to interpret such legal problems based on their own contract law.

<doc id="489788" wikidata="Q98272210" url="?curid=489788" title="Sea mark">
<text>A sea mark, also seamark and [[navigation]] mark, is a form of aid to navigation and pilotage that identifies the approximate position of a maritime channel, hazard, or administrative area to allow boats, ships, and seaplanes to navigate safely.

There are three types of sea mark: beacons fixed to the seabed or on shore, towers (sometimes rock cairns) built on the shore or on a submerged rock/object (especially in calmer waters), and buoys (consisting of a floating object that is usually anchored to a specific location on the bottom of the sea or to a submerged object).

Sea marks are used to indicate channels, dangerous rocks or shoals, mooring positions, areas of speed limits, traffic separation schemes, submerged shipwrecks, and for a variety of other navigational purposes. Some are only intended to be visible in daylight (&quot;daymarks&quot;), others have some combination of lights, reflectors, fog bells, foghorns, whistles and radar reflectors to make them usable at night and in conditions of reduced visibility.

Marks are shown on nautical charts, using symbols that indicate their colour, shape and light characteristic, and are usually identified by name or number.

In a wider sense the phrase &quot;sea mark&quot; is often understood to include all types of landmarks, structures and devices that can be used to provide warning and guiding signs to mariners. Thus a sea mark can be and often is located on dry land. Examples of land-based sea marks are various signal lights and leading marks. The latter are mainly used to indicate the centerline of a fairway in narrow passages. Sea marks may also on occasion be used to help mark the boundaries of defensive sea minefields, or the safe lanes through same, especially during wartime.

==Definitions==
The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities defines one system of marks specifying the shapes, colours and characteristic lights of buoys depending on their purpose, the IALA Maritime Buoyage System. For historical reasons, there are two regions of lateral marks in use:

* IALA &quot;Region B&quot; in the Americas, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan
* IALA &quot;Region A&quot; everywhere else.

The two regions differ principally in the colours used to denote the two sides of a channel. When approaching a harbour from seaward, &quot;Region A&quot; places conical green marks to starboard and cylindrical red ones to port. In &quot;Region B&quot; these are replaced with conical red marks to starboard and cylindrical green ones to port. This can be remembered (for &quot;Region B&quot;) with the mnemonic &quot;Red, right, return&quot;. Another &quot;Region B&quot; mnemonic, which also helps with buoy numbering is &quot;Even Red Left Port&quot; (as in Eric the Red) - Even Numbered buoys are red, on your left (port) side leaving port. In any case, since in many harbours it is not always apparent which direction is seaward, buoys should be used in connection with the appropriate nautical chart. Additionally, since marks may be off station due to collision with ships, storms or other factors, they should be used with caution and not relied on solely for navigation. The two regions are often referred to as two systems, which was the original intent. In 1980 it was decided however to combine these systems and distinguish between regions.

<doc id="489791" wikidata="Q560676" url="?curid=489791" title="Ransom E. Olds">
<text>Ransom Eli Olds (June 3, 1864 – August 26, 1950) was an American businessman and executive who was known as a pioneer of the American automotive industry, of whom the Oldsmobile and REO brands were named after. He claimed to have built his first steam car as early as 1887 and his first gasoline-powered car in 1896. The modern assembly line and its basic concept is credited to Olds, who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash, beginning in 1901.

==Early life==
Olds was born in Geneva, Ohio, the youngest son of blacksmith and pattern-maker Pliny Fiske Olds and his wife, Sarah Whipple Olds. He was of English descent, with origins in Dorset, England. His parents moved the family to Cleveland, Ohio, when Olds was still a boy. He eventually settled in Lansing, Michigan, where he attended high-school before dropping out so that he could work full-time at the family company, P.F. Olds &amp; Son. The company built and sold some steam engines but made most of its money doing repair work. While in Lansing he also married Metta Ursula Woodward on June 5, 1889.

==Career==

===Oldsmobile===
He founded the Olds Motor Vehicle Company in Lansing, Michigan, on August 21, 1897. The company was bought by a copper and lumber magnate named Samuel L. Smith in 1899 and renamed Olds Motor Works. The new company was relocated from Lansing to Detroit. Smith became president while Olds became vice president and general manager.
By 1901 Olds had built 11 prototype vehicles, including at least one of each power mode: steam, electricity and gasoline. In 1934, he received a patent for a diesel engine. He was the only American automotive pioneer to produce and sell at least one of each mode of automobile.

On March 9, 1901, the Olds Motor Works factory burned to the ground. Only one model, the little Curved Dash runabout, was saved from the flames. Ransom Olds claimed it was the fire that made him select the runabout, from among his many other models, to put into production. His biographer questions the veracity of this story. He points to an Olds advertising blitz that had already led to more than 300 Curved Dash orders even before the fire took place. &quot;Olds did not need the one rescued car from which to reconstruct the plans and patterns for the runabout.&quot;

Later that year, Olds had his company&#x27;s test driver, Roy Chapin, drive a Curved Dash runabout to the second annual New York Automobile Show. Along the way, Chapin opted to drive up onto the Erie Canal tow path to escape the mire of New York state roads. After eight days of driving, he reached the Waldorf Astoria hotel but was turned away at the door. His mud-spattered attire was so disreputable that he was sent to the servants&#x27; entrance in back.

During the auto show Olds pushed hard to make sales. When one dealer offered to purchase 500, Olds retorted, &quot;I would like to see you make this order for a thousand cars. Then the public would drop its jaw and take notice.&quot; The deal was signed, and though the dealer ended up selling only 750 to the public, it was the original number that everyone remembered.

The Curved Dash Oldsmobile sold for $650, equal to $ today. About 600 were sold in 1901, about 3,000 in 1902 and at least 4,000 in 1904. It was this car, rather than Henry Ford&#x27;s Model T, that was the first mass-produced, low-priced American motor vehicle.

As Smith&#x27;s son, Frederic L. Smith, came into the business, he and Olds clashed frequently until Fred Smith removed Olds from the position of vice president and general manager in 1904, and Olds left his company. He went on to form the R.E. Olds Motor Car Company. Its name was quickly changed to REO Motor Car Company to avoid a lawsuit from the Olds Motor Works. The name REO came from the initials of his name, but was intended to be an acronym, and thus pronounced as a word. Sometimes it was spelled as &quot;Reo&quot; to emphasize this pronunciation. Olds served as president (until 1925) and later chairman of REO. The band REO Speedwagon took its name from the REO Speed Wagon light delivery truck, an ancestor of pickup trucks, though the band pronounces each letter in REO individually rather than pronouncing REO as a word.

The Olds Motor Works was bought by General Motors in 1908. General Motors discontinued the Oldsmobile brand in 2004, after 107 years in business.

In 1946, Ransom Olds started building lawnmowers as the Lawn Mower Division of REO motors.

===Assembly line===
Olds was the first person to use a progressive moving assembly line in the automotive industry. Henry Ford came after him, and improved upon this by developing a continuously moving synchronous assembly line to manufacture his Model T starting in 1913. The new assembly approach enabled Olds to more than quintuple his factory&#x27;s output, from 425 cars in 1901 to 2,500 in 1902.

===Oldsmar===
In 1916, Olds purchased 37,547 acres (152 km2) of land by the northern part of Tampa Bay in Florida and developed the area into what is now the city of Oldsmar. He traded his land for the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida in 1926.

===Other Lansing businesses===
In 1906, Olds organized the Capital National Bank, later called Lansing National Bank, and Michigan National Bank. Olds was also involved in the organization of the Michigan Screw Company and Atlas Drop Forge Company, all in Lansing, Michigan.

Olds was the primary financier of the Olds Tower. When completed in 1931 it was the tallest office building in Lansing and retains that distinction today. Located at 124 West Allegan Street, the building is now called the Boji Tower.

Olds was also involved in the Hotel Olds at 111 South Capitol Avenue in Lansing. Today this is known as the George W. Romney Building, where the office of the governor of Michigan is located.

==Racing==
Olds was also famous for his auto racing on the beaches of Florida at Ormond and Daytona. He had the first timed run on the beach in a solo run sometime between 1894 and 1897. In 1896 or 1897, rich automobile pioneers Olds and Alexander Winton (Winton Motor Carriage Company) staged an unofficial event; Winton beat Olds by 0.20 second.

==Politics==
Olds was a Republican and served as a delegate from Michigan&#x27;s 6th District to the 1908 Republican National Convention, which nominated William Howard Taft for president.

==Residence==
In the early 1900s, Olds built an elaborate Queen Anne-style mansion on South Washington Avenue in Lansing. Among the home&#x27;s many technological innovations was a turntable in the garage which allowed Olds to pull in at night and leave again the next morning without driving in reverse. The mansion was demolished in 1966 to make way for Interstate 496, which was then named for Olds himself. The architectural drawings of that house are in the archives of the State of Michigan.

==Honors==
He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1946.

==Posthumous==
In 1992, the family&#x27;s mausoleum was vandalized and remains were taken.

<text>The Griquas are a subgroup of mixed-race heterogeneous formerly Xiri-speaking nations in South Africa with a unique origin in the early history of the Dutch Cape Colony. Like the Boers they migrated inland from the Cape and in the 19th century established several states in what is now South Africa and Namibia. The Griqua consider themselves as being South Africa’s first multiracial nation with people descended directly from Dutch settlers in the Cape, and local peoples.

==History==
Griqua was the name given to a mixed-race culture in the Cape Colony of South Africa, around the 17th and 18th centuries (Taylor, 2020). They were also known as Hottentots before Europeans arrived in their lands where they lived as close-knit families. Griqua people’s multiple historical backgrounds have interwoven with rigid apartheid classification, academic attempts to fix the parameters of Griqua identity and the diversity of Griqua ethnic experience to produce a situation of paradoxical status. They are a racially and culturally mixed people who are primarily descendants from European colonist men, and primarily Khoikhoi slaves. The Griquas could trace their forefathers to two clans, the Koks and Barendse, the first was made up mainly of Khoikhoi and the second of mixed European descent. Genetic studies of the 21st century have shown these people also had Tswana, San, and Xhosa ancestry. Later, the Europeans chose mixed-race women of the Khoikhoi, who were living in the Cape during the 17th and 18th centuries. As time went on, mixed-race people began to marry among themselves, establishing a distinct ethnic group that tended to be more assimilated to Dutch and European ways than tribal peoples in separated villages. During Apartheid, the Griqua were racially classified under the broader category of &quot;Coloured&quot; (Taylor, 2020).

Throughout the 18th century, new communities characterized by race, culture, religion, and unequal access to property and power started to form; they came to be connected by spoken word. The term &quot;Bastaards&quot; was used to describe one of these groups of people; it referred to the descendants of marriages between Europeans, slaves, and Khoisan. The word was also applied to subordinate blacks who were proficient in Dutch, could ride horses, and could shoot. &quot;Bastaards&#x27;: or &quot;Basters&#x27;: worked on farms owned by White people in more specialized roles as craftsmen and transport riders. Later, they traveled into the interior bearing these abilities. Originally, the term &quot;Bastaards&quot; referred to people who were more &quot;civilized&quot; and religiously devoted than the Khoikhoi or slaves.

Slavery was practiced in the Dutch East India Company-controlled Cape Colony, and the mixed-race groups that developed in the early Cape Colony as a result of white settler interaction with captured Khoi people who began to work around the farms, eventually opted different names for themselves, including &quot;Bastards&quot;, &quot;Basters&quot;, &quot;Korana&quot;, &quot;Oorlam&quot; or Oorlam Afrikaners, and &quot;Griqua&quot;. Like the Afrikaners, or &quot;Boers&quot; as they were known in that time, many of these groups migrated inland when the British took over the colonial administration. The Khoisan and the Mozambiquans were the one group of people that was often looked down onto as the jobs given to them and the way they lived was not up to standards. The word &quot;Afrikaner&quot; itself was originally (for over 350 years) used as a description for not white Boers but a mixed-race bastard child. The name &#x27;Baster&#x27; and &#x27;Bastards&#x27; were not derived from the English word &quot;bastard&quot;, but rather the Dutch word meaning &quot;hybrid&quot;.

It was only around 1876 that a group of Boer intellectuals, who named themselves &quot;The fellowship of real Afrikaners&quot;, decided to use the term as a new means to describe the Boer people, as part of the project to create a new national identity for pioneer Boer people during the First and Second Boer Wars and for more powerful political legitimacy. This is why today many Afrikaans-speaking white people are still known as Afrikaners, as this message was powerfully conveyed as a national identity during the times of the South African Union (1910–1961) and the apartheid years of the Republic of South Africa.

According to the 18th-century Dutch historian Isaak Tirion, the Khoi name &quot;Griqua&quot; (or &quot;Grigriqua&quot;) is first recorded in 1730 about a group of people living in the northeastern section of the Cape Colony. In 1813, Reverend John Campbell of the London Missionary Society (LMS) used the term Griqua to describe a mixed-race group of &quot;Chariguriqua&quot; (a Cape Khoikhoi group), &quot;Bastaards&quot;, &quot;Korana&quot;, and &quot;Tswana&quot; living at the site of present-day Griekwastad (then known as Klaarwater). Klaarwater was the first Griqua settlement which emerged in the early 19th century in what is now the Northern Cape province of South Africa. Established by the Griqua leader Adam Kok I, Klaarwater served as a refuge and trading hub for Griqua communities, as well as for other indigenous groups and European settlers. The settlement grew rapidly, attracting people from various backgrounds seeking economic opportunities and protection from conflicts in the region. Klaarwater&#x27;s strategic location facilitated trade routes between the interior of Southern Africa and the Cape Colony, contributing to its significance as a cultural and economic center. Despite facing challenges such as colonial expansion and land dispossession, Klaarwater played a pivotal role in the history of the Griqua people and remains an important symbol of their resilience and cultural heritage. The British found their &quot;proud name&quot;, &quot;Bastaards&quot;, offensive, so the LMS called them Griqua. The term Bastaards refers to a group of people of mixed origin. The Bastaards were not given legal status because of them being &quot;Mixed&quot;. The Griquas were not happy about this and built a force of their own. The Bastaards joined the Khoi and San and the Bastaards made sure that they were skilled men in combat tactics. When it came to war the Griquas decided to flee the Dutch and live the way they wanted to, the way their foremothers had lived.

An insignificant amount of Bastaards groups were formed in the Northwestern and eastern border suburbs of Colesberg, Roggerfeld, Namaqualand, and Hantam. They had European names and were able to speak Afrikaans, and their children were baptized in churches. They have their own church, which is Protestant in South Africa, and that is where their children most likely got baptised. They were informed of commando services.

The actual name was derived from the Chariaguriqua people whose princess became the wife of the first Griqua leader, Adam Kok I (Taylor, 2020). Adam Kok was a liberated slave, who figured out how to acquire &quot;burgher&quot; rights and a ranch close to the present Piketberg, established the most incredible blended local area. Because of a common ancestor named Griqua and shared links to the Chariguriqua (Grigriqua), the people officially changed their name to the Griqua. Legend has it that in the 1750s, Adam Kok married the daughter of the Chariguriqua, chief of the Khoikhoi clan. Kok was a former slave who managed to rule the Griqua nation and he led his people across the country, South Africa to settle next to the Orange River. He was referred to as the chief of the colored people.

Adam Kok I&#x27;s father was Cornelius Jacobz who worked for the VOC and his mother was a slave. His father believed that the Cape was The Garden of Eden and this is how Adam got his name. His surname &#x27;Kok&#x27; comes from the Dutch word &quot;kok&quot; which means cook, or chef, an occupation Adam once fulfilled. Kokstad was named after the Griqua chief Adam Kok the Third who settled there in 1863.

Cornelius was the son of Adam Kok III and got baptised by the missionary John Phillip in 1800. This was the beginning of Christianity amongst the Basters. The missionaries did not agree with the degrading name, basters. The Griquas accepted their new name and this is how the mission town Klaarwater&#x27;s name changed to Griquatown.

The Boers arrived in the area of Griquatown after Natal was taken over by the British. They acquired land from the Griqua, buying it in exchange for horses, liquor, firearms and ammunition. Trouble started when the Kok arrested a Boer accused of ill-treating his people, and the trekker community tried to take over his entire territory. A British force stationed at Colesberg quickly crossed the Orange River and defeated the Boers at Zwartkoppies.

The chief&#x27;s land was divided in two, one side was to keep the chief and his people busy and the other side was for the Boers who paid rent to the chief and the Cape government.

The arrival of the Boers and the colonial masters to the area known as Griqualand West denied the Griquas the opportunity to follow their own development paths. They lost their land and traditional resources and were tossed into a sea of rapid social change which saw them lose the independence they had searched for in the Orange Free State area. They were disheartened and had to relocate.
The Dutch East India Company (VOC) did not intend for its Cape Colony possessions at the southern tip of Africa to develop into a political entity. As the colony expanded and became more successful, its leadership did not worry about its frontiers. As a result, the frontier of the colony was indeterminate and ebbed and flowed at the whim of individuals. While the VOC undoubtedly benefited from the trading and pastoral endeavours of the Trekboers, it did little to control or support them in their quest for land. The high proportion of single Dutch men led to many taking indigenous women as wives and companions, producing mixed-race children. These multiracial offspring gradually developed as a sizable population who spoke Dutch and were instrumental in developing the colony.

These children did not attain the social or legal status accorded their fathers, mostly because colonial laws recognised only Christian forms of marriage. This group became known as Basters, derived from &quot;bastaard&quot;, the Dutch word for &quot;bastard&quot; (or &quot;crossbreed&quot;). As part of the European colonists&#x27; paramilitary response to insurgent resistance from Khoi and San peoples, they conscripted Basters men into commando units. This allowed the men to become skilled in lightly armed and mounted skirmish tactics. In the winter of 1831, a Ndebele commando attacked a Griqua commando led by Gert Hooyman who intruded the Ndebele territory and stole many of their cattle. Hooyman warned the Griqua troops to be vigilant because the Ndebele might come for revenge at any time. They ignored him and on this night the Ndebele attacked the Griquas while they were still feasting on their stolen cattle. Around 1000 Griqua men were killed on the now famous hill called Moordkop. But many recruited to war chose to abandon Dutch society and strike out to pursue a way of life more in keeping with their maternal culture. The resulting stream of disgruntled Dutch-speaking marksmen leaving the Cape hobbled the primarily Dutch colonists&#x27; ability to crew commando units. It also created belligerent, skilled groups of opportunists who harassed indigenous populations along the Orange River. Once free of colonial rule, these groups referred to themselves as &quot;Oorlam&quot;. In particular, the group led by Klaas Afrikaner became notorious for its exploits. They attracted enough attention from the Dutch authorities that Afrikaner was eventually rendered to the colony and banished to Robben Island in 1761.

==Griqua migrations==

The Griquas settled on the outskirts of the Cape Colony since they were neither European nor African. They formed their own communities and spoke Afrikaans. The Griqua surnames were predominantly Afrikaans and are still common in the coloured community today. Many of the Griqua men enlisted to do commando service. However, the Griquas were constantly being removed from their land as the Europeans took preference over them. This caused the Griquas to move away from the Cape colony in search of their own land. This migration was in two main groups, the Kok and Barends families.

One of the most influential of these Griqua groups was the Oorlam. In the 19th century, the Griqua controlled several political entities that were governed by &quot;Kapteins&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Captain&quot;) and their councils, with their own written constitutions. The first Griqua &quot;Kaptein&quot; was Adam Kok I, a former slave who had bought his own freedom. Kok led his people north from the interior of the Cape Colony, likely to escape discrimination, before moving north again. As Voortrekker moved North to Natal and found out the Natal was under British control, they remembered the good lands they had passed through so they moved back over the Drakensberg mountains.

He eventually led them beyond the Cape Colony, near the Orange River just west and south of what would eventually become the Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal, respectively. This area is where most of the tribe settled, although some remained nomadic. Prior to beginning their migrations, the Griqua had largely adopted what would be known as the Afrikaans language.
Adam Kok I, the first Kaptein of the Griqua and recognised by the British, was originally a slave who had bought his own freedom. He led his people north from the interior of the Cape Colony. Probably because of discrimination against his people, they again moved north—this time outside the Cape, taking over areas previously controlled by San and Tswana people.

Adam Kok, head of the Griquas at Nomansland, on the demand of the teacher John Campbell, concocted the name Griqua. They set up a fundamental arrangement of government dependent on pioneers known as kaptyns and officers drawn from the main families. However, Kok had a rival known as Nicholas Waterboer, he ruled the farthest west of Kimberley. He was no threat to Kok until diamonds were discovered there. Kok&#x27;s successor, Andries Waterboer, founded Griqualand West, and controlled it until the influx of Europeans after the discovery of diamonds. In 1834, the Cape Colony recognised Waterboer&#x27;s rights to his land and people. It signed a treaty with him to ensure payment by Europeans for the use of the land for mining. In 1876, Chief Waterboer was caught and jailed when he tried to free some of his followers from a prison work gang. The diamond fields were named after him. It wasn&#x27;t until October 18, 1880, that the Cape Parliament&#x27;s Bill of Annexation became law (SESA 1972). It was passed on August 5, 1879. In 1877, a census of Griqualand West showed that the province had 44,877 people living in it, with 12,374 of them being of European descent. (&quot;Griqua | South African History Online&quot;)

In the first 15 years of Griqua Philippolis, Adam Kok II, and the most important of his successors, Adam Kok III, constructed a system of private ownership in land. This was a rather novel land regime at the time for all polities in this part of sub-Saharan Africa, and for it to persevere in the face of increasing white interest in the region, the Griqua state — or ‘captaincy’ — needed to be extensive, bureaucratic, and respected: resilient in the face of serious challenge, coherent to both the Cape Colony administration and Boer communities.1 The organisation of this captaincy was key to its success. The Captain sat at the head of his volksraad, a nominated council of varying size and influence. The raad would come to decisions collectively, but the Captain always retained a right of veto. Together, the Captain and raad codified laws and pencilled out their own land titles. The enforcement of these laws was mostly left up to other executive roles, including the veldkornets, who performed a similar magisterial and policing role as the Boer officials of the same title did, and the kommandants, who also acted as police but were mostly in charge of organising military campaigns and commandos. 
Another important founding father of the Griquas was Barend Barends. He led a group of Griquas to fight against Mzilikazi at Moordkop in the North West Province. The battle led to the deaths of many Griquas. Barends was no match for Milikazi and many of the Griqua soldiers died during this battle. Trudie (Barends Granddaughter) was captured by Milikazi and forced to join Milikazi as his harem. It is rumoured that she was later rescued by a missionary, Robert Moffet. It is believed that Griqua blood runs through the Ndebele people from the children that Trudie bore during her years with Milikazi.

==Current situation==

Despite similarly mixed-race origins, those Coloured peoples identifying as Basters are considered to be a separate ethnic group and live primarily in south-central Namibia, while those who consider themselves Griqua are mostly located around Campbell and Griquatown in the historic territory of Griqualand West in the Northern Cape; around the small Le Fleur Griqua settlement at Kranshoek in the Western Cape; and at Kokstad in KwaZulu-Natal. It is important to note that the Griqua nation, largely founded on the Khoikhoi, were pastoral people who lived a laid-back life at one with nature and their surroundings.

Due primarily to the racial policies of South Africa during the apartheid era, many Griqua people accepted classification in the larger &quot;Coloured&quot; group for fear that their Griqua roots might place them at a lower level than other groups. As a result, estimates of the size of the Griqua population are difficult to determine and remain largely unknown. During apartheid, the Griqua were further marginalized when they were not given &quot;Griquastans&quot; or special territorial reserves.

Genetic evidence indicates that the majority of the present-day Griqua population is descended from a combination of European, Khoikhoi and Tswana ancestors, with a small percentage of San, or Bushmen, ancestry. Griqua historians in South Africa and Namibia are digging into their past and telling their stories.
Building work started on the Griqualand West Supreme Court, on the Market Square in 1882 and took two years to complete, opening in February 1884. This was short-lived as the building was declared unsafe in 1886, partially demolished and rebuilt. The clock tower (with clock) was added on in 1889. The building remained the Supreme Court of Griqualand West until 1968 when it moved to its present position in the Civic Centre (Malay Camp), but was retained as the Magistrate’s Court until May 1990 when the staff moved into their new premises on Knight Street – opened officially by Kobie Coetsee on 22 February 1991.

In 1999, the National Khoi-San Council (NKC) was established and facilitated discussions between these indigenous people and the South African Government. They discussed and collaborated on many issues concerning the Khoisan people. Griqua people are represented by the National Khoisan Consultative Conference (Afrikaans: &quot;Nasionale Khoe-San Oorlegplegende Konferensie&quot;), which was established in Oudtshoorn in 2001 to represent the interests of South Africa&#x27;s Khoisanid peoples. The conference participates in cooperative research and development projects with the provincial government of the Western Cape and the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein. Members of the influential Le Fleur clan of Griqua are especially represented in this body.

The Griqua established their own church, known as the Griqua Church, which is Protestant. The Church has a strong focus on maintaining Griqua cultural and ethnic identity. They are represented mostly in South Central Namibia. The church was the first church to be established in South Africa in 1920.

One of several disputed theories as to the origin of Bloemfontein&#x27;s name connects it to the Griqua leader Jan Bloem (1775–1858). However, this may be a coincidence as &quot;Bloemfontein&quot; is Dutch for &quot;fountain of flowers&quot;, or &quot;blooming fountain&quot;, and the area could have been named for its local vegetation.

The Griquas started a campaign in 1994 to bring back the remains of Saartjie Baartman from France. The GNC (Griqua National Conference) wanted to see the original identity of the Griqua nation restored. Saartjie was a member of the Khoikhoi people. She was a slave who was taken to Europe to be viewed as a &#x27;freak show attraction&#x27; by people who paid to do so. The Griquas wanted to honor their Khoi forefathers by at least being able to bury her body in her homeland.

==Griqualand==

Several areas of South Africa became known as &#x27;Griqualand&#x27; when the group migrated inland from the Cape and established separate communities. The Griqua were the first from the Cape to make their way to and remain in the Transorangia area, beyond the Orange River. Some Griqua raided the Tlhaping, a Tswana speaking community, while others obtained cattle from them which was used to trade with the Cape farmers for firearms, horses, and wagons.


Griqualand East, officially known as New Griqualand was one of four short-lived Griqua states in Southern Africa from the early 1860s until the late 1870s and was located between the Umzimkulu and Kinira Rivers, south of the Sotho Kingdom. Is the area around Kokstad on KwaZulu-Natal&#x27;s frontier with the Eastern Cape. It was a historical division in the Eastern Cape province approximately 19000 km2. This area was named after Adam Kok III. In 1861–1862, Kok III led more than 2,000 Griqua through Basutoland over the Drakensberg mountains. They settled on a piece of unclaimed territory between Pondoland and Natal which subsequently became known as Griqualand East. The region remained independent for a few years before the territory was annexed by Britain. Griqua descendants are now largely concentrated in Kokstad, where the Griqua Church (Protestant) is the center of the community.

Griqualand West is the area around Kimberley, which became an important mining town in the decades following the first local discovery of diamonds in 1866. Ownership of the diamond fields was contested by the Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, as well as various other groups like the KhoiKhoi, Koranas under Andries Waterboer, and the Batlhaping under Chief Mankuroane.In 1870, Transvaal President Andries Pretorius declared the diamond fields as Boer property. &quot;Griquatown Gold&quot; known as Tiger&#x27;s Eye is the only feasible mining that can be traced back to Adam Kok and his ancestors. Kimberley is also known for its sports teams, including the Griquas rugby team, which competes in South Africa&#x27;s annual Currie Cup tournament and contests its home matches at Griqua Park. With the arrival of the Boers to Griqualand West, the Griqua lost their land and traditional cultures and were tossed into a rapidly changing Orange Free State area.

<doc id="489794" wikidata="Q272741" url="?curid=489794" title="Adenoma">
<text>An adenoma is a benign tumor of epithelial tissue with glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenomas can grow from many glandular organs, including the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid, prostate, and others. Some adenomas grow from epithelial tissue in nonglandular areas but express glandular tissue structure (as can happen in familial polyposis coli). Although adenomas are benign, they should be treated as pre-cancerous. Over time adenomas may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas. Most adenomas do not transform. However, even though benign, they have the potential to cause serious health complications by compressing other structures (mass effect) and by producing large amounts of hormones in an unregulated, non-feedback-dependent manner (causing paraneoplastic syndromes). Some adenomas are too small to be seen macroscopically but can still cause clinical symptoms.

== Histopathology ==

Adenoma is a benign tumor of glandular tissue, such as the mucosa of stomach, small intestine, and colon, in which tumor cells form glands or gland-like structures.
In hollow organs (digestive tract), the adenoma grows into the lumen - adenomatous polyp or polypoid adenoma. Adenomatous polyps may be classified based on morphology in order to identify lesions at increased risk of malignant transformation. For example, adenomatous polyps in the colon may be pedunculated (lobular head with a long slender stalk) or sessile (broad base).

The adenomatous proliferation is characterized by different degrees of cell dysplasia (atypia or loss of normal differentiation of epithelium) irregular cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, stratified or pseudostratified nuclei, nucleolus, decreased mucosecretion, and mitosis. The architecture may be tubular, villous, or tubulo-villous. Basement membrane and muscularis mucosae are intact.

==Locations==

===Colon===

Adenomas of the colon, also called adenomatous polyps, are quite prevalent. They are found commonly at colonoscopy. They are removed because of their tendency to become malignant and to lead to colon cancer.

Ashkenazi Jews have a 6% higher risk rate of getting adenomas, and then colon cancer, than do the general population, so it is important that they have regular actual colonoscopies, and specifically none of the less invasive diagnostic methods.

===Renal===
This is a tumor that is most often small and asymptomatic, and is derived from renal tubules. It may be a precursor lesion to renal carcinoma.

===Adrenal===

Adrenal adenomas are common, and are often found on the abdomen, usually not as the focus of investigation; they are usually incidental findings. About one in 10,000 is malignant. Thus, a biopsy is rarely called for, especially if the lesion is homogeneous and smaller than 3 centimeters. Follow-up images in three to six months can confirm the stability of the growth.

While some adrenal adenomas do not secrete hormones at all, often some secrete cortisol, causing Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, aldosterone causing Conn&#x27;s syndrome, or androgens causing hyperandrogenism.

===Thyroid===

About one in 10 people is found to have solitary thyroid nodules. Investigation is required because a small percentage of these is malignant. Biopsy usually confirms the growth to be an adenoma, but, sometimes, excision at surgery is required, especially when the cells found at biopsy are of the follicular type.

===Pituitary===
Pituitary adenomas are seen in 10% of neurological patients. A lot of them remain undiagnosed. Treatment is usually surgical, to which patients generally respond well. The most common subtype, prolactinoma, is seen more often in women, and is frequently diagnosed during pregnancy as the hormone progesterone increases its growth. Medical therapy with cabergoline or bromocriptine generally suppresses prolactinomas; progesterone antagonist therapy has not proven to be successful.

===Parathyroid===
An adenoma of a parathyroid gland may secrete inappropriately high amounts of parathyroid hormone and thereby cause primary hyperparathyroidism.

===Liver===

Hepatic adenomas are a rare benign tumour of the liver, which may present with hepatomegaly or other symptoms.

===Breast===
Breast adenomas are called fibroadenomas. They are often very small and difficult to detect. Often there are no symptoms. Treatments can include a needle biopsy, and/or removal.

===Appendix===
Adenomas can also appear in the appendix. The condition is extremely rare. The most common version is called cystadenoma. They are usually discovered in the course of examination of the tissue following an appendectomy. If the appendix has ruptured and a tumor is present, this presents challenges, especially if malignant cells have formed and thus spread to the abdomen.

===Bronchial===
Bronchial adenomas are adenomas in the bronchi. They may cause carcinoid syndrome, a type of paraneoplastic syndrome.

===Sebaceous===
A sebaceous adenoma is a cutaneous condition characterized by a slow-growing tumour usually presenting as a pink, flesh-coloured, or yellow papule or nodule.

===Salivary glands===
Most salivary gland tumors are benign – that is, they are not cancer and will not spread to other parts of the body. These tumors are almost never life-threatening.
There are many types of benign salivary gland tumors, with names such as adenomas, oncocytomas, Warthin tumors, and benign mixed tumors (also known as pleomorphic adenomas).
Benign tumors are almost always cured by surgery. Very rarely, they may become cancer if left untreated for a long time or if they are not completely removed and grow back. It&#x27;s not clear exactly how benign tumors become cancers. There are many types of salivary gland cancers. Normal salivary glands are made up of several different types of cells, and tumors can start in any of these cell types. Salivary gland cancers are named according to which of these cell types they most look like when seen under a microscope. The main types of cancers are described below.
Doctors usually give salivary cancers a grade (from 1 to 3, or from low to high), based on how abnormal the cancers look under a microscope. The grade gives a rough idea of how quickly it is likely to grow and spread.

* Grade 1 cancers (also called low grade or well differentiated) look very much like normal salivary gland cells. They tend to grow slowly and have a good outcome (prognosis).
* Grade 2 cancers (also called intermediate grade or moderately differentiated) have an appearance and outlook that is between grade 1 and grade 3 cancers.
* Grade 3 cancers (also called high grade or poorly differentiated) look very different from normal cells and often grow and/or spread quickly. The outlook for these cancers is usually not as good as for lower grade cancers.

===Prostate===
Prostate adenoma develops from the periurethral glands at the site of the median or lateral lobes.

==Treatment==
A physician&#x27;s response to detecting an adenoma in a patient will vary according to the type and location of the adenoma among other factors. Different adenomas will grow at different rates, but typically physicians can anticipate the rates of growth because some types of common adenomas progress similarly in most patients. Two common responses are removing the adenoma with surgery and then monitoring the patient according to established guidelines.

One common example of treatment is the response recommended by specialty professional organizations upon removing adenomatous polyps from a patient. In the common case of removing one or two of these polyps from the colon from a patient with no particular risk factors for cancer, thereafter the best practice is to resume surveillance colonoscopy after 5–10 years rather than repeating it more frequently than the standard recommendation.
