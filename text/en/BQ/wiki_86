<text>Inspector Rex (German: &quot;Kommissar Rex&quot;; Italian: &quot;Il commissario Rex&quot;) is an Austrian-German police crime drama television series created by Peter Hajek and Peter Moser. Originally an Austrian series aired from 1994 to 2004 on ORF 1, in 2008 it was revived under Austro-Italian production on Rai 1 and, from the next year, was made fully in Italy, with occasional episodes set in Austria. Rai 1 eventually cancelled the Austro-Italian production in June 2015, after eight Italian seasons.

The series follows the German Shepherd police dog Rex, his partners and the rest of the team at the Vienna Kriminalpolizei homicide unit, as they work together to solve crimes. From 2008, episodes are set in Rome.

A spin-off series, &quot;Stockinger&quot;, that focuses on Ernst Stockinger, one of the original members of the homicide division, was televised in 1996. International remakes include Polish &#x27; (English title: &quot;Inspector Alex&quot;), set in [[Łódź]] (2012–present); Russian &quot;[[Muhtar&#x27;s return]]&quot; (2004–2019, broadcast on [[Russia-1]] and [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]]); Portuguese&#x27; (2004–present); Lithuanian &quot;Inspektorius Mažylis&quot; (2014); Slovak &quot;Rex&quot; set in Bratislava (2017) and Canadian &quot;Hudson &amp; Rex&quot; (2019–present).

== Synopsis ==
The original series is set in Vienna and focuses on the three-man staff of an office of the Kriminalpolizei - the Austrian Criminal Police - specifically a &quot;Mordkommission&quot; (homicide unit). In addition to the three policemen, the office is staffed by a German Shepherd called Rex, the main star of the show, who functions variously as a cadaver dog, a sniffer dog (for both contraband and narcotics) and as another pair of eyes and ears for his team.

The original team at the office consisted of Richard Moser, Ernst Stockinger and Peter Höllerer. This team was also assisted by forensic expert Dr Leo Graf and retired policeman Max Koch. The show had many changes in characters, including Christian Böck replacing Stockinger, Alexander Brandtner replacing Moser and former statistics officer Fritz Kunz replacing Höllerer. The final Austrian incarnation of the series featured a male-female duo of the clumsy Marc Hoffmann and a female officer Nikki Herzog working alongside Kunz. Dr. Graf is the only character to remain for the entire Austrian production of the series.

In season eleven, the action moves to Rome, with Inspector Lorenzo Fabbri taking charge of the dog. Episodes were produced in both Italian and German. At the end of the season, Rex is apparently mortally wounded when he jumps on Fabbri&#x27;s head to protect him from a bullet, but is shown in close-up still slightly breathing just before credits roll. The beginning of season 12 shows that Rex survived the bullet, when Fabbri takes Rex to the animal hospital.

== Production ==
For the first ten seasons the show was scripted entirely in German, where most characters spoke with Austrian dialects. It was shot on location in Vienna and its surroundings, though the usage of areas in production was often geographically incorrect. While subtitles were used for most international markets, the series was dubbed in some countries, including France, Greece, Italy and Spain.

Following declining ratings during the eighth and ninth seasons, the series was cancelled mid-production in 2004, leaving the tenth and then final season with only four episodes and no finale that concluded the story. As the series was still highly popular abroad, particularly in Italy and Austria, the show remained in syndication for many years.

In 2007, following negotiations, Italian broadcaster RAI secured the rights to revive the series, with production moving to Rome. For the first season of the new series, numbered as season eleven, it was produced in both Austria and Italy, with production moving to Italy full-time for the twelfth season. A total of eighteen seasons were produced, the last airing in 2015, barring repeats. While occasional episodes were set in Austria, the series was scripted and filmed primarily in Italian from 2008 to the concluding 2015 season.

=== Australian season numbering ===
For Australian markets, season numbering was altered for airing on SBS, and this numbering was also used on the DVD sets, leaving some viewers confused as to how the European episode lists correspond with the Australian ones. For the DVD sets, seasons 1 to 8 have been re-arranged to seven longer seasons (the chronological episode order remaining unchanged), with the ninth and tenth season being labeled as &quot;season eight&quot;. They have since followed the official lists, with season eleven labeled as season nine, season twelve as season ten and so on.

==Characters==
===Rex===
A trained police dog, Rex (revealed in the Pilot to be registered as &quot;Reginald von Ravenhorst&quot;) is the star of the show. Establishing shots frequently show him demonstrating a new trick — unlatching doors, pushing trolleys, pointing to drugs or corpses — which then turn out to be useful in the course of the episode. He is often used to stalk suspects, often with a GPS-type object attached to him so that the officers can keep track.

Rex was stolen by criminals as a pup but managed to escape and befriend a boy, where he helped to solve his first case with the boy.

Initially, Rex and Moser share an apartment at Marokkanergasse 18, Wien-Landstraße; however the pair go house-hunting at the start of season 2. They quickly find a house (Waldstraße 8, Purkersdorf) owned by a man who does not want dogs there. However, Rex is able to alert him to a gas leak, and in gratitude, he allows Moser and Rex to stay.

Rex is frequently called upon to resolve difficult situations, including helping a young girl in shock, preventing a woman from committing suicide and helping to get Moser&#x27;s mobile phone when a crime has been committed. One famous episode features Moser using Rex to resolve a hostage situation by telling him to creep up behind the criminal and &quot;frighten him&quot; (following Rex&#x27;s earlier success at frightening Stockinger by jumping on him from behind).

There is also a considerable element of humour in Rex&#x27;s activities. Rex has an uncanny penchant for ham rolls or &quot;Wurschtsemmln&quot; in the local dialect. He is introduced to them by Moser, who tells him, &quot;I practically live on these.&quot; Rex constantly annoys Stockinger by pulling on his coat and stealing his ham rolls. Later, Höllerer keeps a running score of Böck&#x27;s success against Rex – not a flattering result for the officer. While not chasing criminals, he often plays pranks on the officers or fails to obey orders to help with the housework. Rex is very fond of horses and once fastened a rope to Alex&#x27;s car so he could take the horse home. Another time, Rex attacked a man who was beating a horse and, later in the same episode, he ran into a burning barn to rescue a horse.

With Moser, Rex reacts particularly badly to words like &quot;frau&quot; (woman) and, later, &quot;tierarzt&quot; (vet), as he disapproves of his master&#x27;s attention to women. During a scene in which Koch claims that Moser &quot;doesn&#x27;t understand women at all now,&quot; Moser tells Koch, &quot;Don&#x27;t say that word. Every time you say &#x27;woman&#x27;, he [Rex] runs off with my laundry. &quot; Koch asks him what Rex does with it, to which Moser replies, &quot;He washes it.&quot; Rex was not jealous of Alex and stole a rose for Alex to give to a pretty blonde co-worker.

Once, when Moser is working undercover and needs to ensure Rex won&#x27;t greet him, he tells Stockinger, &quot;You only need to say &#x27;vet&#x27; to him and he&#x27;ll stop whatever he&#x27;s doing&quot;, a statement which results in a memorable scene involving Stockinger walking after Rex at a crime scene calling out &quot;Vet! Vet!&quot;

Rex has to date been played by four dogs. Until 2000, he was played by Santo vom Haus Zieglmayer, also known as &#x27;Beejay&#x27;, and was then replaced by Rhett Butler. For the 2008 revival, Rex is played by a dog named Henry. Between 2012/13, Rex is played by Nicky.

===Rex&#x27;s partners===

Richard Moser (Tobias Moretti, 1994–1998)
Source:

The first &quot;team leader&quot;, Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Moser is a hard-bitten cop who, as the first season begins, is going through a bitter divorce from his wife Gina, who takes all their furniture. Moser is also attempting to quit smoking to improve his blood circulation.
An ex-truck driver, Moser credits Max Koch with keeping him from a life of crime, at one point telling Koch that &quot;I&#x27;d be on the wrong side of the law too, just like him&quot;, referring to a young pickpocket he has just chased through central Vienna.

Moser befriended Rex, whose former police trainer, Michael, was shot and killed by an escaping suspect. To save the dog from being put down, Moser &quot;adopted&quot; him without ever completing any of the official paperwork. He famously declares at one point, &quot;My taxes pay for this dog, so why can&#x27;t I give him a better home?&quot; Moser, in contrast to his successors, is shown to be quite athletic, often performing acrobatic stunts while chasing suspects. Moretti&#x27;s looks were also exploited by the producers of the show. He made several nude appearances, including an episode where Moser and a female colleague frolic naked in the woods to attract a serial killer targeting young couples.

As Moser&#x27;s personal life improves, his sense of humour returns. This is noticeable in the general lightening in the tone of the show from the initial episodes (&quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot; being a prime example) to ones with more lighthearted banter among the officers. Being a bachelor, Moser flirts with many of the attractive women featured in the storylines. Moser begins a relationship with Sonja, his local vet, which Rex thoroughly disapproves of and constantly tries to sabotage. In time, Rex accepts Sonja and even pretends to have an injured paw when he wants her to stay with him. Sonja eventually leaves Moser and Rex when she is offered a job in America.

In the final scenes of the season 4 episode &quot;Moser&#x27;s Death&quot;, Moser is killed in the line of duty by an escaped &#x27;borderline psychopath&#x27;, played by famous German actor Ulrich Tukur (&quot;Das Leben der Anderen&quot;) while Moser is rescuing his lover, Patricia Neuhold (a psychologist who has been helping with the case). The escapee commits suicide just after he kills Moser, and there is a heartbreaking scene at the hospital after the doctor tells Moser&#x27;s friends that he died. Rex takes a squeaky toy that Moser bought at the beginning of the episode to Moser&#x27;s body and squeaks it until he accepts his master is gone, then he lays his head on Moser&#x27;s chest and the scene fades to white.

Alexander Brandtner (Gedeon Burkhard, 1998–2001)

Alex Brandtner replaces Moser as team leader. Following Moser&#x27;s death, Rex has become depressed and refuses to eat, wanting to stay near Moser&#x27;s house all the time. However, Brandtner succeeds in helping Rex out of his depression. Brandtner had lost his former dog, Arko, in an explosion and does not want to work with dogs again until he meets Rex. The explosion has also robbed him of his hearing in his right ear, a fact he confides only to Rex. Brandtner moves into the house that Moser and Rex used to share, apparently because Rex does not want to leave.

Brandtner is portrayed as very attractive to women and performs various physical stunts throughout the series, such as diving over car bonnets, engaging in fast-paced chases on foot, and dives. On his first appearance in the show, he dives into the Danube to retrieve a vital piece of evidence, and later in his debut episode he parachutes from a light aircraft, along with Rex, in order to apprehend a suspect. His living room is filled with boxing and fitness gear.

He had once gone undercover in a prison and also as a drunken homeless man. He also seems to have an uncanny instinct for sensing if a suspect is guilty or innocent, even without evidence.

During the time Burkhard was on the show, the international ratings for the series increased. Unlike Moretti, Burkhard&#x27;s looks were not exploited by the producers of the show, and he did not make nude appearances. The most skin that Burkhard showed was in an episode where a bank burglar forced Brandtner to strip to prove that he was unarmed before parading him through the street in only his underwear.

Marc Hoffmann (Alexander Pschill, 2002–2004)

Replacing Brandtner as team leader, Hoffmann is a very eager detective. Hoffmann is portrayed as being very witty, outsmarting murderers. He shares a close relationship with Nikki Herzog, although they sometimes have disagreements.

Apparently Hoffmann had studied forensic science under Graf, and the two men still seem to share a somewhat master-student relationship, with Hoffmann often deferring to Graf&#x27;s judgment (where Brandtner and Moser had previously not always done so).

Lorenzo Fabbri (Kaspar Capparoni, 2008–2012)
In season 11, Rex moves to Rome, where he meets his new partner, Italian homicide detective Chief Inspector Lorenzo Fabbri. Rex seems to understand the Italian language quite easily.
In the second episode of season 14 (entitled &quot;Amidst the Wolves&quot;), Fabbri dies in the explosion of a car during a trap prepared by a Mafia boss.

Davide Rivera (Ettore Bassi, 2012–2013)
Davide Rivera replaces Fabbri as team leader in season 14. Rivera becomes a friend with Rex after the loss of Inspector Lorenzo Fabbri. He follows his grandfather&#x27;s advice, and eventually, Rex stops avoiding him.

Rivera appears for the last time on the last episode of season 15, titled &quot;Legami di sangue.&quot; It is unknown why he does not appear in season 16.

Marco Terzani (Francesco Arca, 2013–2015)
Marco Terzani replaces Rivera as team leader in season 16.

===Other detectives===

Ernst Stockinger (Karl Markovics, 1994–1996)

The &quot;straight man&quot; to Rex — and, increasingly, Moser — Ernst Stockinger (&quot;Stocki&quot; for short) is a character who becomes much more likeable as his part in the series develops. Stockinger is thin and always has a very serious demeanour. In later episodes, this is revealed as a cover for his schemes to outsmart Rex, who loves to tease him. Although Stockinger pretends not to like dogs, he risks his career to help Moser save Rex when the dog is kidnapped to prevent Moser from testifying against an assassin. For all Stockinger&#x27;s constant irritation with Rex, he genuinely has come to care for this particular dog. This is very obvious in the last two episodes Stocki appears in, when he is upset that Rex jumps from one roof to another to capture a killer. Stocki is also openly affectionate to Rex once his transfer is approved, and he realizes how much he is going to miss the team. He tells Richard and Höllerer they are his only friends and includes Rex as his friend as well.

Stockinger is married, and his wife, it seems, is not greatly pleased with her husband&#x27;s choice of career at times, and Moser often reminds him of this. Stocki&#x27;s knowledge of women does not save him and Rex from being thrown out by Stocki&#x27;s wife when he watches Rex and the dog howls for Moser.

Another of Stockinger&#x27;s idiosyncrasies is his constant references to surgery, which has been performed on him - most likely for stomach ulcers. He seems to delight in telling stories about this surgery at the most inappropriate moments, such as when the others are about to eat.

Eventually, Stockinger is transferred to Salzburg and leaves the series. In this final episode, Rex saves Stockinger by leaping across a classroom just as a disgruntled divorced man was about to stab Stockinger in the throat during an attempted kidnapping attempt on his child. Moser, in a farewell speech, jokingly tells Stocki, &quot;You have been a bad cop, a bad man, and not at all a good friend.&quot; Stockinger later features in a spin-off two season television series, &quot;Stockinger&quot;, featuring him at his new police department. He is replaced by Christian Böck.

Peter Höllerer (Wolf Bachofner, 1994–1999)
Source:

The obese Peter Höllerer is a constant source of comic relief in the series. Generally found ensconced behind his desk working the phones, his face visibly falls whenever Moser and Stockinger (or, later, Brandtner and Böck) require him to do fieldwork. That said, he is capable of surprising speed when running and can also demonstrate driving skills on a par with other officers. In one episode, Höllerer is taken hostage by a man with a bomb who forces him to drive away from a police blockade. Höllerer turns the tables by driving at high speed into an empty parking lot and diving out of the car. In another episode, Höllerer disarmed a bomb just before it would have exploded.

Höllerer tends to take a co-ordinating role when an operation is being planned, rather than actually going undercover or making the arrest himself. In these situations, he reveals himself to have a very clear head and to be capable of coping with even the most unusual situations that his partners get involved in.

Höllerer has a soft spot for Rex as the series progresses, after first voicing concern that Moser did not adopt him through the proper channels. This is shown by his keeping score between Böck and Rex in the early episodes featuring the former. Höllerer takes inordinate delight in seeing the dog outsmarting the man.

Höllerer&#x27;s departure from the series is brought about by his retirement to care for his ailing mother, a woman about whom he often speaks. He is replaced by Fritz Kunz.

Of all the recurring characters in the series, Höllerer&#x27;s accent is the thickest. Viewers familiar with standard German will often have difficulty understanding his Viennese dialect.

Christian Böck (Heinz Weixelbraun, 1996-2001)

Böck is first introduced as a somewhat suspicious-looking character, a member of a borderline-illegal car club who is not even trusted by his club mates. During the course of his investigation into this club, Moser begins to suspect Böck, but he turns out to be an undercover policeman making similar investigations.The two eventually combine to solve the relevant case, and Moser convinces Böck to transfer to his team. Böck&#x27;s undercover skills are largely ignored after the transfer, but his personable manner proves an advantage when it comes to interrogations (particularly contrasting with the somewhat dour Moser). By the time of Brandtner&#x27;s arrival, Böck&#x27;s youth and athleticism have resulted in his frequently being involved in chasing criminals on foot. The dynamic between Böck and Kunz forms an almost constant source of comic relief. Most notable in this is their dialogue when trying to establish the angle from which a witness would have seen a certain event - each man speaks at cross-purposes to the other, and both end up totally confused.
Böck and Rex share a rivalry, with Böck trying to outsmart Rex, but Rex wins nearly all the time. Böck is also one of the few who question Rex&#x27;s abilities as an elite police dog, but Moser keeps telling him that he has always been this way.

Fritz Kunz (Martin Weinek, 1999-2004, 2008)

Replacing Höllerer after the latter&#x27;s retirement to care for his mother, Kunz has been drawn from the statistics section of the force. Initially, he is very much out of place in the slightly freer atmosphere of Brandtner&#x27;s office. A running gag in his early appearances deals with his obsessive-compulsiveness and fussy attention to the placement of his desk stationery (e.g., pencils arranged from tallest to shortest and paper clips aligned) only to have Rex or one of the others move everything around.

Kunz&#x27;s background in statistics is also often the source of amusement, as he is seemingly able to deliver, from memory, obscure statistical information about the activities of criminals. He tends to be used to man the phones during investigations rather than on active duty. However, he is also occasionally required to go undercover (once as a kitchen hand, another time as a stable hand and another as an entertainer in a street market), much to his chagrin. Kunz is much tougher than he looks. He once smashed a door in with an axe just in time to save Alex&#x27;s life after a murder suspect left Alex face down and unconscious in a filling bathtub.

Nikki Herzog (Elke Winkens)

The only female officer in the history of the show, Herzog (played by Elke Winkens) is paired with Hoffmann (Kunz is almost entirely desk-bound in this incarnation of the series), and sexual tension constantly results. The pair spend the night together before starting their new jobs, without realising that they are both police officers.

In contrast to Hoffmann, Herzog tends to be more level-headed and capable of performing physical acts. Her physical appearance also serves the team well in relating to suspects, as she is frequently underestimated and sometimes taunted by brash male criminals.

Giandomenico Morini (Fabio Ferri)

Morini is a colleague of Lorenzo Fabbri, and they work on every crime together. Rex does not obey Morini at all. However, in one episode, he takes care of Rex because Fabbri has broken his ankle. At the beginning of the 14th season, he is transferred to Milan and leaves the series.

Alberto Monterosso (Domenico Fortunato)

Alberto Monterosso replaces Morini.

===Other characters===

Dr Leo Graf (Gerhard Zemann)

Dr Leo Graf is the forensic pathologist consulted by the detectives. On occasion, he is found at the crime scene itself. However, he is normally to be found in his pathology laboratory and occasionally comes into the police office. Gerhard Zemann is the only actor to appear as the same character throughout the long-running series.

Dr Graf is a sometimes prickly personality, but underneath this exterior, he has a very dry wit - frequently regaling the detectives against their will with the gruesome details of a murder.

Naturally, he is quite comfortable in his lab, surrounded by dead bodies, even if others are not. Many of the earlier episodes highlight the contrasting reactions of the policemen (especially Moser and Stockinger) and Graf to the death all around them.

At times, however, Dr Graf clearly resents the pressure put on him by the policemen. One memorable telephone exchange involves Moser agreeing to pay Dr Graf a number of Cuban cigars for working on the weekend. Another time, Graf&#x27;s car is towed while he is investigating a murder scene. The resulting invective he uses towards the authorities responsible is caustic.

Where Graf is very amiable towards Moser&#x27;s team, this relationship progressively changes as Brandtner arrives. Early episodes featuring Brandtner show Alex and Leo using formal language - generally involving the German &quot;Sie&quot; form of address (the polite form). Eventually, this exterior is broken down, and the new team is invited to call him Leo - a sign of considerable familiarity in German or Austrian society. Accordingly, Brandtner&#x27;s greeting to Graf alters from the formal &quot;Guten Morgen&quot; to the more familiar &quot;Servus.&quot;

With Hoffmann and Herzog, however, the relationship with Graf is more of a teacher-student one. It emerges early that Hoffmann had been taught forensic techniques by Graf, and it is clear that some of the awe felt by the considerably younger policeman for his mentor is still present. Graf also assumes a much more advisory role with this team, appearing only once during each investigation instead of being constantly on call.

By the time Rex moves to Rome with Lorenzo Fabbri of the Italian police, Dr Graf still serves as Vienna&#x27;s main forensic officer as seen in a Rex special as Rex and Fabbri return to Vienna to investigate a case there.

Max Koch (Fritz Muliar)

Familiarly known to all as Max, Koch is a retired policeman who saved Moser from a life of crime and became something of a mentor to him. Many early episodes feature Moser asking Koch for advice - often in a café or a pool hall. It is, in fact, advice from Koch which is responsible for solving many of the more baffling cases, as his insights into human psychology - particularly female psychology (something he often claims Moser has had no knowledge of since his divorce) - prove correct. Occasionally, when a case hinges on the behaviour of a female witness or suspect, Koch good-humouredly teases Moser about women and gently tells him, &quot;Richard, since your divorce, you&#x27;ve lost your touch with women&quot;

As the series progresses, Koch&#x27;s role alters to that of being a useful spy for Moser in certain situations where his team is too well-known. It is Koch&#x27;s visit to a restaurant that provides the breakthrough in one case. In another, he stumbles upon the solution to a particularly brutal homicide while sitting in a park with Rex. Koch is increasingly reluctant to help Moser with his work, although he is always told that this will be the last time. As Stockinger points out, it always &quot;is&quot; the last time... until the next request. Moser also tries to appeal to Koch&#x27;s sense of adventure which, as Max famously explains, is satisfied by eating goulash and not knowing if he will suffer from &quot;Rinderwahnsinn&quot; (mad cow disease).

Following Stockinger&#x27;s transfer to Salzburg, Koch assists the team to reorganise the office. His snide remarks about Stockinger&#x27;s files result in Höllerer telling him to read through them all (to which Koch responds that he&#x27;s doing more work since he retired than he did when he worked). He also spreads out his pipe collection on Stocki&#x27;s old desk and declares that he will &quot;open a pipe shop&quot; while the team attempts to find a replacement for Stocki. Max is no longer seen or spoken of after Moser&#x27;s death.

Katia Martelli (Pilar Abella)

Katia Martelli is the forensics officer in Rome. She is seen as a romantic interest for Fabbri, but Rex is opposed to this. She is always looking for an opportunity to ensnare him. At one point, when Fabbri is injured and is at home researching a murder related to role playing games on his computer, he asks for a gaming police officer to be sent to his house to brief him about computer game culture. Martelli takes this opportunity to enter his house and seduce him, and creates an RPG profile for him so he can befriend the suspects online—the figure she chooses for him is a model of Fabbri wearing only a towel.

Morini constantly goads Martelli and Fabbri into coupling. After one case is solved, Fabbri takes her home to wine and dine her, much to Rex&#x27;s chagrin. At the start of the next episode, they drunkenly awake in Fabbri&#x27;s bed.

Filippo Gori (Augusto Zucchi)

Filippo Gori is Fabbri&#x27;s boss who hates Rex when they first meet and vows to eject him for being unauthorised. Eventually, he accepts that Rex can solve crimes and lets him stay; this came after Rex and Fabbri had brought down a prostitution and sex slave racket run by some illegal Chinese immigrants—Fabbri leaked the story to a journalist friend so that Rex was photographed on the front page of a newspaper. In the episode &quot;A Man Alone,&quot; his partner is murdered. Although all limited evidence points to Gori, Fabbri proves that he is not the culprit.

Filippo (Morini&#x27;s fish)

Filippo is Morini&#x27;s fish. Morini got a fish because he was jealous of Lorenzo. Morini does not realize that he has named his fish after his boss, so when Gori comes in, he says his fish is called Filiberto.

<text>L&#x27;Aquila ( ; ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in central Italy. It is the capital city of both the Abruzzo region and of the Province of L&#x27;Aquila, Italy. , it has a population of 69,902 inhabitants. Laid out within medieval walls on a hill in the wide valley of the Aterno river, it is surrounded by the Apennine Mountains, with the Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia to the north-east.

L&#x27;Aquila sits upon a hillside in the middle of a narrow valley; tall snow-capped mountains of the Gran Sasso massif flank the town. A maze of narrow streets, lined with Baroque and Renaissance buildings and churches, open onto elegant piazzas. Home to the University of L&#x27;Aquila, it is a lively college town and, as such, has many cultural institutions: a repertory theatre, a symphony orchestra, a fine-arts academy, a state conservatory, a film institute. There are several ski resorts in the surrounding province (Campo Imperatore, Ovindoli, Pescasseroli, Roccaraso, Scanno).

==Geography==
Close to the highest of the Apennine summits, L&#x27;Aquila is positioned at an elevation of in the Valley of the Aterno-Pescara, situated between four mountain peaks above .

The mountains block the city off from warm humid air currents from the Mediterranean, and give rise to a climate that is cool in comparison to most of central Italy, and dry. It&#x27;s common to say between locals that the city enjoys each year 11 cold months and one cool one (&quot;Undici misi de friddu e unu de friscu&quot;).

L&#x27;Aquila is approximately east-northeast of Rome, with which it is connected by an autostrada through the mountains.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The city&#x27;s construction was begun by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, out of several already existing villages (ninety-nine, according to local tradition; see Amiternum), as a bulwark against the power of the papacy. The name of Aquila means &quot;Eagle&quot; in Italian. Construction was completed in 1254 under Frederick&#x27;s son, Conrad IV of Germany. The name was switched to Aquila degli Abruzzi in 1861, and L&#x27;Aquila in 1939. After the death of Conrad, the city was destroyed by his brother Manfred in 1259, but soon rebuilt by Charles I of Anjou, his successor as king of Sicily. The walls were completed in 1316.

It quickly became the second city of the Kingdom of Naples. It was an autonomous city, ruled by a diarchy composed of the City Council (which had varying names and composition over the centuries) and the King&#x27;s Captain. It fell initially under the lordship of Niccolò dell&#x27;Isola, appointed by the people as the People&#x27;s Knight, but he was then killed when he became a tyrant. Later, it fell under Pietro &quot;Lalle&quot; Camponeschi, Count of Montorio, who became the third side of a new triarchy, with the Council and the King&#x27;s Captain. Camponeschi, who was also Great Chancellor of the kingdom of Naples, became too powerful, and was killed by order of Prince Louis of Taranto. His descendants fought with the Pretatti family for power for several generations, but never again attained the power of their ancestor. The last, and the one true &quot;lord&quot; of L&#x27;Aquila, was Ludovico Franchi, who challenged the power of the pope by giving refuge to Alfonso I d&#x27;Este, former duke of Ferrara, and the children of Giampaolo Baglioni, deposed lord of Perugia. In the end, however, the Aquilans had him deposed and imprisoned by the king of Naples.

The power of L&#x27;Aquila was based on the close connection between the city and its mother-villages, which had established the city as a federation, each of them building a borough and considering it as a part of the mother-village. The Fountain of the 99 Spouts (&quot;Fontana delle 99 Cannelle&quot;), was given its name to celebrate the ancient origin of the town. The City Council was originally composed of the Mayors of the villages, and the city had no legal existence until King Charles II of Naples appointed a &quot;Camerlengo&quot;, responsible for city tributes (previously paid separately by each of its mother-villages). Later, the Camerlengo also took political power, as President of the City Council.

From its beginnings the city constituted an important market for the surrounding countryside, which provided it with a regular supply of food: from the fertile valleys came the precious saffron; the surrounding mountain pastures provided summer grazing for numerous transhumant flocks of sheep, which in turn supplied abundant raw materials for export and, to a lesser extent, small local industries, which in time brought craftsmen and merchants from outside the area.

Within a few decades L&#x27;Aquila became a crossroads in communications between cities within and beyond the Kingdom, thanks to the so-called &quot;via degli Abruzzi&quot;, which ran from Florence to Naples by way of Perugia, Rieti, L&#x27;Aquila, Sulmona, Isernia, Venafro, Teano and Capua.

Negotiations for the succession of Edmund, son of Henry III of England, to the throne of the Kingdom of Sicily involved L&#x27;Aquila in the web of interests linking the Roman Curia to the English court. On 23 December 1256 Pope Alexander IV elevated the churches of Saints Massimo and Giorgio to the status of cathedrals as a reward to the citizens of L&#x27;Aquila for their opposition to King Manfred who, in July 1259, had the city razed to the ground in an attempt to destroy the negotiations. On 29 August 1294 the hermit Pietro del Morrone was consecrated as pope Celestine V in the church of Santa Maria di Collemaggio, in commemoration of which the new pope decreed the annual religious rite of the Pardon (nowadays known as Celestinian Forgiveness, &quot;Perdonanza Celestiniana&quot;), still observed today in the city on 28 and 29 August: it is the immediate ancestor of the Jubilee Year.

The pontificate of Celestine V gave a new impulse to building development, as can be seen from the city statutes. In 1311, moreover, King Robert of Anjou granted privileges which had a decisive influence on the development of trade. These privileges protected all activities related to sheep-farming, exempting them from customs duties on imports and exports. This was the period in which merchants from Tuscany (Scale, Bonaccorsi) and Rieti purchased houses in the city. Hence the conditions for radical political renewal: in 1355 the trade guilds of leather-workers, metal-workers, merchants and learned men were brought into the government of the city, and these together with the Camerario and the Cinque constituted the new Camera Aquilana. Eleven years earlier, in 1344, the King had granted the city its own mint.

In the middle of the 14th century the city was struck by plague epidemics (1348, 1363) and earthquakes (1349). Reconstruction began soon, however. In the 14th–15th century Jewish families came to live in the city, while the generals of the Franciscan Order chose the city as the seat of the Order&#x27;s general chapters (1376, 1408, 1411, 1450, 1452, 1495). Bernardino of Siena, of the Franciscan order of the Observance, visited L&#x27;Aquila twice, the first time to preach in the presence of King René of Naples, and in 1444, on his second visit, he died in the city. In 1481 Adam of Rottweil, a pupil and collaborator of Johann Gutenberg, obtained permission to establish a printing press in L&#x27;Aquila.

The Osservanti branch of the Franciscan order had a decisive influence on L&#x27;Aquila. As a result of initiatives by Friar Giovanni da Capistrano and Friar Giacomo della Marca, Lombard masters undertook, in the relatively underdeveloped north-east of the city, an imposing series of buildings centring on the hospital of Saint Salvatore (1446) and the convent and the Basilica of San Bernardino. The construction work was long and difficult, mainly because of the earthquake of 1461, which caused the buildings to collapse, and the translation of the body of San Bernardino did not take place until 14 May 1472. The whole city suffered serious damage on the occasion of the earthquake, and two years went by before repairs on the churches and convents began.

In a strategy finalised to increasing their political and economic autonomy, the Aquilani took a series of political gambles, siding sometimes with the Roman Papacy, sometimes with the Kingdom of Naples. When the Pope excommunicated Joanna II, Queen of Naples, appointing Louis III of Anjou as heir to the crown in her stead, L&#x27;Aquila sided with the Angevines. Joanna hired the condottiero Braccio da Montone. In exchange for his services, Braccio obtained the lordship of Teramo, as well as the fiefdoms of Capua and Foggia: he started a 13-month-long siege of L&#x27;Aquila, that resisted bravely. Facing Braccio, at the head of the Angevine army was Muzio Attendolo Sforza and his son Francesco. The final clash between the two contenders was just below the walls of Aquila, near the hamlet today called Bazzano. In the battle fought on 2 June 1424, Braccio, mortally wounded in the neck, was made prisoner and transported to Aquila, where he died three days later, on 5 June 1424. The Pope had him buried in deconsecrated earth. The citizens of L&#x27;Aquila honoured the bravery of their enemy Braccio by dedicating one of the main streets of the city to his name.

===Modern era===
This period of freedom and prosperity ended in the 16th century, when Spanish viceroy Philibert van Oranje partially destroyed L&#x27;Aquila and established Spanish feudalism in its countryside. The city, separated from its roots, never developed again. Ancient privileges were revoked. L&#x27;Aquila was again destroyed by an earthquake in 1703. Successive earthquakes have repeatedly damaged the city&#x27;s large cathedral, and destroyed the original dome of the Basilica of San Bernardino, designed along the lines of the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence. The city was also sacked two times by French troops in 1799.

L&#x27;Aquila, like so much of Italy, is a city of political contrasts. In the 1970s a novel by Alberto Moravia was seized because it was considered obscene, a local Catholic Archbishop protested the nudity of a centuries-old statue of a young man, and a group of local reactionaries even asked for the seizure of the £50 coin because it showed a naked man. In October 2003, however, a liberal judge in l&#x27;Aquila ordered the small town of Ofena to remove a crucifix from its elementary school so as not to offend the religious sensibilities of two young Muslim students. After a national outcry, the judge&#x27;s decision was overturned. In May 2007 Massimo Cialente, a physician and medical researcher, was elected mayor of L&#x27;Aquila with a centre-left coalition.

===Earthquakes===

Earthquakes mark the history of L&#x27;Aquila, as the city is partly built on an ancient lake-bed which amplifies seismic activity.

On 3 December 1315 the city was struck by an earthquake which seriously damaged the San Francesco Church. Another earthquake struck on 9 September 1349, killing about 800 people. Other earthquakes struck in 1452, then on 26 November 1461, and again in 1501 and 1646. On 3 February 1703 a major earthquake struck the town. More than 3,000 people died and almost all the churches collapsed; Rocca Calascio, the highest fortress in Europe was also ruined by this event, yet the town survived. L&#x27;Aquila was then repopulated by decision of Pope Clement XI. The town was rocked by earthquake again in 1706. On 26 June 1958 an earthquake of 5.0 magnitude struck the town.

On 6 April 2009, at 01:32 GMT (03:32 CEST) an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude struck central Italy with its epicentre near L&#x27;Aquila, at . Initial reports said the earthquake caused damage to between 3,000 and 10,000 buildings in L&#x27;Aquila. Several buildings also collapsed. 308 people were killed by the earthquake, and approximately 1,500 people were injured. Twenty of the victims were children. Around 65,000 people were made homeless. There were many students trapped in a partially collapsed dormitory. The 6 April earthquake was felt throughout Abruzzo; as far away as Rome, other parts of Lazio, Marche, Molise, Umbria, and Campania.

===G8 summit===
Because of the 2009 earthquake, the Berlusconi government decided to move that year&#x27;s G8 summit from its scheduled Sardinian host of La Maddalena to L&#x27;Aquila, so that disaster funds would be distributed to the affected region and to show solidarity with the city&#x27;s inhabitants. World leaders converged on L&#x27;Aquila on 8 July and many of them were given tours of the devastated city by the host Prime Minister.

== Demographics ==
==Climate==
L&#x27;Aquila has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb), influenced by its high altitude.

==Main sights==

Although less than an hour-and-a-half drive from Rome, and popular with Romans for summer hiking and winter skiing in surrounding mountains, the city is sparsely visited by tourists. Among the sights are:

===Religious buildings===
*L&#x27;Aquila Cathedral: main church dedicated to Saint Maximus of Aveia (San Massimo), was built in the 13th century, but razed after the 1703 earthquake. The most recent façade dated from the 19th century, but the earthquake of 2009 and subsequent aftershocks collapsed parts of the transept and possibly more of the cathedral.
*Basilica of San Bernardino (1472): church has a fine Renaissance façade by Nicola Filotesio (commonly called Cola dell&#x27;Amatrice), and contains the monumental tomb of the saint (1480), decorated with sculptures, and executed by Silvestro Ariscola.
*Santa Maria di Collemaggio: church just outside the town, has a very fine, but simple, Romanesque façade (1270–1280) in red and white marble, with three decorated portals and a rose-window above each. The two side doors are also fine. The interior contains the mausoleum of Pope Celestine V erected in 1517.
*Santa Giusta: Romanesque façade with Gothic rose window
*San Silvestro: 14th-century Romanesque façade with Gothic rose window
*Chiesa dei Santi Marciano e Nicandro: a 13th century church

===Secular buildings===
*Spanish fort (&quot;Forte Spagnolo&quot;): massive castle in the highest part of the town, erected in 1534 by the Spanish viceroy Don Pedro de Toledo. In 2016, home to the National Museum of Abruzzo.
*&quot;Fontana Luminosa&quot; (&quot;Luminous Fountain&quot;): a 1930s sculpture of two women bearing large jars.
*&quot;Fontana delle novantanove cannelle&quot; (1272): a fountain with ninety-nine jets distributed along three walls. The source of the fountain is still unknown. 
*&quot;L&#x27;Aquila cemetery&quot;: includes grave of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, 19th‑century German gay rights pioneer who lived in L&#x27;Aquila; every year, gay people from all over the world meet at the cemetery to honour his memory.
* Palace of Nobles
*&quot;Roman ruins of Amiternum&quot;: ruins of an Ancient Roman city

Also nearby are several ski resorts like Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia, the highest of the Apennines where in its valley the movie &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; was filmed in the end of the 1980s. The town also contains some fine palaces: the municipality has a museum, with a collection of Roman inscriptions and some illuminated service books. The Palazzi Dragonetti and Persichetti contain private collections of pictures.

==Culture==
===Cinematographic activities===
The first step of L&#x27;Aquila in the cinematographic activities was the Cineforum Primo Piano founded by Gabriele Lucci in the middle of the 1970s. As a work of Lucci, in 1981 saw the establishment of l&#x27;Istituto Cinematografico dell&#x27;Aquila, an institute for the production and diffusion of the cinematographic culture in Italia and abroad.

The Teatro Stabile d&#x27;Abruzzo is based in the city and was formed in 2000.

===Sport===
The city is the home of five-time Italian champions L&#x27;Aquila Rugby. The football squad, L&#x27;Aquila Calcio, played 3 times in serie B.

<doc id="505959" wikidata="Q859552" url="?curid=505959" title="Big in Japan (band)">
<text>Big in Japan were a punk band that emerged from Liverpool, England, in the late 1970s. They are better known for the later successes of their band members than for their own music.

==History==
Big in Japan began from the same Merseyside scene that would produce Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, the Teardrop Explodes, OMD and Dalek I Love You.

Big in Japan started off playing gigs around Liverpool, such as Ruffwood School in Kirkby along with Wah! Heat, but most notably at Eric&#x27;s Club. Their stage show was unique: lead singer Jayne Casey would perform with a lampshade over her shaved head, guitarist Bill Drummond played in a kilt and bassist Holly Johnson performed in a flamboyant manner which he would later take further in Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

As an initial idea of Deaf School&#x27;s Clive Langer, his friend Bill Drummond (guitar, vocals), Kevin Ward (bass, vocals) and Phil Allen (drums) formed the band in May 1977, playing only three gigs, the first of them at Bretton Hall College in Yorkshire. In August, the line-up grew to include Jayne Casey (vocals), Ian Broudie (guitar) and Clive Langer (guitar), who quit in September, but not before the band recorded their first release, &quot;Big in Japan&quot;, which appeared on the split single &quot;Brutality, Religion and a Dance Beat&quot;, released the same year. In October, Ambrose Reynolds joined to replace Ward who then left that December, but Reynolds himself quit shortly afterwards and was replaced by Holly Johnson. In January 1978, Budgie (previously in the Spitfire Boys and later member of the Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees) replaced Allen on drums, and in early June, Johnson was sacked and replaced with ex-Deaf School Steve Lindsey, who was replaced in July by Dave Balfe (previously in Dalek I Love You), the last member to join.

Hatred of the band reached such a level that a petition calling on them to split up was launched by a jealous young Julian Cope resulting from a rivalry with the Crucial Three. Displayed in local shop Probe Records, the petition gathered numerous signatures, including those of the band themselves. According to Cope&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Of course, Bill Drummond was into the whole thing and told us we needed 14,000 signatures, then they&#x27;d split up. We got about nine&quot;. In the 1980s, Drummond became manager of Cope&#x27;s band, the Teardrop Explodes.

The band broke up after a last gig at Eric&#x27;s on 26 August 1978. During their time, Big in Japan recorded four songs which were included on the &quot;From Y to Z and Never Again&quot; EP, released afterwards to pay off debts. The unintentional consequence of the EP was the formation of the Zoo label, which went on to release early material by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes, amongst others. They also recorded a Peel Session on 12 February 1979, with a line-up of Casey, Broudie, Johnson and Budgie; the session was broadcast on 6 March 1979. Balfe and Drummond then formed the short-lived Lori and the Chameleons.

Big in Japan left a recorded legacy of seven songs: one on a single, four on their EP &quot;From Y to Z and Never Again&quot;, and two released on compilation albums. As of 2005, five out of these recorded songs are commercially available, on the compilation album &quot;The Zoo: Uncaged 1978–1982&quot;.

According to the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;, Big in Japan were &quot;a supergroup with a difference—its members only became super after they left&quot;; former members of Big in Japan would later find fame in the KLF, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the Lightning Seeds, the Teardrop Explodes and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

The first single of German band Alphaville was called &quot;Big in Japan&quot;, named directly after the band. Coincidentally, Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s single &quot;Relax&quot; was displaced from the top of the German charts by Alphaville&#x27;s &quot;Big in Japan&quot;. Singer/songwriter Marian Gold later said that &quot;we never got to speak with him [Holly Johnson] but he must have wondered &#x27;who is this German group with a song named after my band?&#x27;&quot;.

===Members&#x27; remembrances===
Jayne Casey later states:

Ian Broudie said:

Bill Drummond recalled:

==Discography==

===Singles and EPs===
* &quot;Brutality, Religion and a Dance Beat&quot; (Eric&#x27;s, September 1977) – split with Chuddie Nuddies
* &quot;From Y to Z and Never Again&quot; (Zoo, 1978)

===Compilations===
* &quot;Street to Street: A Liverpool Album&quot; (1978) – &quot;Match of the Day&quot;
* &quot;To the Shores of Lake Placid&quot; (1982) – &quot;Suicide a Go Go&quot; / &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot;
* &quot;The Zoo: Uncaged 1978–1982&quot; (1990) – &quot;Nothing Special&quot; / &quot;Cindy &amp; the Valley of the Barbie Dolls&quot; / &quot;Suicide a Go Go&quot; / &quot;Taxi&quot; / &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot;

===Other work===
Three unreleased songs were recorded for the band&#x27;s only John Peel session of 6 March 1979; &quot;Suicide High Life&quot;, &quot;Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bomb China&quot;.

A bootleg CD is in circulation which contains all of the material listed above as well as demo versions of &quot;Society for Cutting Up Men&quot; (named after the manifesto Society for Cutting Up Men), &quot;Boys Cry&quot;, &quot;Big in Japan&quot;, &quot;Space Walk&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot;. It also contains the audio from the band&#x27;s performance of &quot;Suicide a Go Go&quot; on their Granada TV appearance of 23 March 1978 (on Tony Wilson&#x27;s, &quot;So It Goes&quot;).

Black-and-white, amateur home movie footage of the band performing live at Eric&#x27;s still exists—excerpts of the band performing both &quot;Big in Japan&quot; and &quot;Cindy and the Barbi Dolls&quot; were used in the BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Rock Family Trees: The New Merseybeat&quot;, originally broadcast in August 1995 and repeated in 1997.

<text>David Louis Bartholomew (December 24, 1918 – June 23, 2019) was an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger, and record producer. He was prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century. Originally a trumpeter, he was active in many musical genres, including rhythm and blues, big band, swing music, rock and roll, New Orleans jazz, and Dixieland. In his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he was cited as a key figure in the transition from jump blues and swing to R&amp;B and as &quot;one of the Crescent City&#x27;s greatest musicians and a true pioneer in the rock and roll revolution&quot;.

Many musicians have recorded Bartholomew&#x27;s songs, but his partnership with Fats Domino produced some of his greatest successes. In the mid-1950s they wrote more than forty hits for Imperial Records, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; number one pop chart hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;. Bartholomew&#x27;s other hit songs as a composer include &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot;, &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot;, and &quot;One Night&quot;. He was a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born Davis Bartholomew on December 24, 1918, in Edgard, Louisiana, to Mary and Louis Bartholomew. He learned to play his father&#x27;s preferred instrument, the tuba, then took up the trumpet, taught to him by Peter Davis, who had also tutored Louis Armstrong. Around 1933, Bartholomew moved with his parents to New Orleans, where he played in local jazz and brass bands, including Papa Celestin&#x27;s, as well as Fats Pichon&#x27;s band on a Mississippi riverboat. He took charge of Pichon&#x27;s band in 1941, and after a stay in Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s band joined the US Army during World War II. He developed writing and arranging skills as a member of the 196th Army Ground Forces Band.

===Early music career===
At the end of the war Bartholomew returned to New Orleans and, by November 1945, had started leading his own dance band, Dave Bartholomew and the Dew Droppers, named after a local hotel and nightclub, the Dew Drop Inn. The band became locally popular, described as &quot;the bedrock of R&amp;B in the city&quot;, and, according to the music historian Robert Palmer, was a &quot;model for early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll bands the world over&quot;. A local journalist wrote of the band, in June 1946: &quot;Putting it mildly, they make the house &#x27;rock&#x27;.&quot; In 1947, they were invited by club owner Don Robey to perform in Houston, Texas, where Bartholomew met Lew Chudd, the founder of Imperial Records.

Bartholomew and his band made their first recordings, including &quot;She&#x27;s Got Great Big Eyes&quot;, at Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s New Orleans studio for De Luxe Records in September 1947. Their first hit was &quot;Country Boy&quot;, credited to Dave Bartholomew and His Orchestra, which reached No. 14 in the national &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in early 1950. Prominent members of the band, besides Bartholomew on trumpet and occasional vocals, were the saxophonists Alvin Tyler, Herb Hardesty, and Clarence Hall, the bass player Frank Fields, the guitarist Ernest McLean, the pianist Salvador Doucette, and the drummer Earl Palmer. They were later joined by the saxophonist Lee Allen.

===Imperial Records and Fats Domino===

Two years after they had first met in Houston, Lew Chudd asked Bartholomew to become Imperial&#x27;s A&amp;R man in New Orleans. Bartholomew produced Imperial&#x27;s first national hits, &quot;3 x 7 = 21&quot;, written by him and recorded by the female singer Jewel King, and &quot;The Fat Man&quot;, recorded in December 1949 by a young pianist, Fats Domino. &quot;The Fat Man&quot; — based on the drug-themed &quot;Junker&#x27;s Blues&quot;, with lyrics rewritten by Bartholomew and Domino to attract a wider audience — reached No. 2 on the R&amp;B chart and eventually sold over one million copies, kicking off Domino&#x27;s career.

Both records featured Bartholomew&#x27;s band, as did a succession of further hits through the 1950s. Bartholomew&#x27;s &quot;genial, steady-rolling arrangements&quot; contributed to the music&#x27;s success. Cosimo Matassa said, &#x27;Many times I think Fats&#x27; very salvation was Dave being able to be stern enough and rigid enough to insist on things getting done... He was adamant as he could be about the discipline of the players.&#x27;

Bartholomew left Imperial after a disagreement with Chudd at the end of 1950, and for two years he recorded for other labels, including Decca, King and Specialty. Among his recordings at King was &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot;, which Bartholomew wrote and first recorded in January 1952; the song was later recorded by Chuck Berry, who had an international hit with it in 1972, although Berry substantially changed the song&#x27;s arrangement and verses and claimed credit for writing it. While at Specialty, Bartholomew produced Lloyd Price&#x27;s recording of &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, which featured Domino (uncredited) on piano. The single reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart in mid-1952.

After that success, Bartholomew returned to Imperial to work again on Domino&#x27;s recordings, co-writing and producing a series of R&amp;B hits for him. Domino&#x27;s crossover to the pop chart came in 1955 with &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; (initially titled &quot;Ain&#x27;t It A Shame&quot;), on which Bartholomew deliberately sought to make Domino&#x27;s style more appealing to white record buyers. Further, hits followed through the late 1950s and early 1960s: &quot;I&#x27;m in Love Again&quot; and &quot;Blue Monday&quot; (both in 1956), &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot; (1957), &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday&quot; (1959), &quot;Let the Four Winds Blow&quot; (1961) — all co-written and produced by Bartholomew — and &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; (1956) and &quot;Walking to New Orleans&quot; (1960), also produced by Bartholomew.

Over the same period, Bartholomew wrote, arranged, and produced recordings by many other Imperial artists, including Smiley Lewis (for whom Bartholomew wrote &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot; and &quot;One Night&quot;, both of which were hits and were later recorded by other musicians), the Spiders, Chris Kenner, Earl King, Tommy Ridgley, Robert Parker, T-Bone Walker, Roy Brown, Frankie Ford, and Shirley and Lee (who recorded for Aladdin Records and for whom Bartholomew produced &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot;). Several of Bartholomew&#x27;s songs were later covered by other musicians. &quot;Ain&#x27;t That A Shame&quot; was recorded successfully by Pat Boone; &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot; was a hit for Gale Storm in the 1950s and Dave Edmunds in the 1970s; &quot;One Night&quot; and &quot;Witchcraft&quot; were hits for Elvis Presley; and &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot; was a hit for Ricky Nelson. On various of his songs, a co-writing credit was given to his wife, Pearl King (sometimes confused with the musician Earl King).

===Later life and death===
After Imperial was sold to Liberty Records in Los Angeles in 1963, Bartholomew remained in New Orleans, working for Trumpet Records and Mercury Records and then establishing his own label, Broadmoor Records, in 1967. The label folded the following year, when its distributor, Dover Records, collapsed.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Bartholomew led a traditional Dixieland jazz band in New Orleans, releasing an album, &quot;Dave Bartholomew&#x27;s New Orleans Jazz Band&quot;, in 1981. He also took part in Fats Domino&#x27;s international tours during that period. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a non-performer in 1991, and released two further albums in that decade, &quot;Dave Bartholomew and the Maryland Jazz Band&quot; (1995) and &quot;New Orleans Big Beat&quot; (1998), while continuing to make occasional appearances with his band at festivals.

Bartholomew married Pearl King in 1942. After her death in 1967 he married Rhea (née Douse), with whom he had four sons and one daughter. He remained a resident of New Orleans, and celebrated his 100th birthday on Christmas Eve 2018, but plans for a celebration concert were suspended after he was hospitalized.

Bartholomew died of heart failure at East Jefferson General Hospital in Metairie, Louisiana on June 23, 2019, and was buried at St Gabriel the Archangel Catholic Church in Gentilly.

<doc id="505966" wikidata="Q703333" url="?curid=505966" title="Comic timing">
<text>Comic timing or comedic timing emerges from a performer&#x27;s joke delivery: they interact with an audience—intonation, rhythm, cadence, tempo, and pausing—to guide the audience&#x27;s laughter, which then guides the comedic narrative. The pacing of the delivery of a joke can have a strong impact on its comedic effect, even altering its meaning; the same can also be true of more physical comedy such as slapstick. Comic timing is also crucial for comedic video editing to maximize the impact of a joke, for example, through a smash cut.

== History ==
The use of comic timing can be first observed in the comic plays of the ancient Greeks. Specifically, Aristophanes indicated brief pauses in his works, such as &quot;The Clouds&quot;, in order to elicit laughter from the unfolding events. William Shakespeare, along with comic playwrights before him, also utilized comic timing in much of his plays. For example, Cleopatra&#x27;s strategic interjections during Mark Antony&#x27;s speech in Act 1 Scene 2 of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, shift an otherwise serious scene to a comic one. George Bernard Shaw notably continued the usage of comic timing into the late 19th century. In his 1894 play &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; for instance, Shaw triggers laughter near the end of Act 2 through Nicola&#x27;s calculated eruptions of composure.

While the use of comic timing continued to flourish on stage, by the mid-20th century, comic timing became integral to comedy film, television and stand-up comedy. In movies, comedians such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Buster Keaton perfected their comedic performances through precise timing in films like &quot;One A.M.&quot;, &quot;The Lucky Dog&quot;, and &quot;The Playhouse&quot; respectively. In television, Lucille Ball notably utilized comic timing in her show &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. For example, in the episode &quot;Lucy Does a TV Commercial&quot; Ball acts out an advertisement within a fake television set, but ruins the illusion by a comically timed break of the TV&#x27;s fourth wall. In stand-up, George Carlin&#x27;s routine &quot;Seven Words You Can&#x27;t Say on Television&quot; gets a laugh from the timing difference between the delivery of the first 6 words and the seventh. Additionally, Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s routine &quot;No One Called Jones&quot; utilized a slow comic timing in his list of students&#x27; names to reveal multiple double entendres.

While the above history highlights specific writers and performers, all workers in comedy, from Victor Borge to Sacha Baron Cohen and beyond, have utilized comic timing to deliver their humour most effectively.

==Beat==
A beat is a pause taken for the purposes of comic timing, often to allow the audience time to recognize the joke and react, or to heighten the suspense before delivery of the expected punch line. Pauses—sometimes called &quot;dramatic pauses&quot;—in this context, can be used to distinguish subtext or even unconscious content—that is, what the speaker is really thinking about. A pause can also be used to heighten a switch in direction. As a speaker talks, the audience naturally &quot;fills in the blanks&quot;, finishing the expected end of the thought. The pause allows this to happen before the comedian delivers a different outcome, thus surprising the listener and (hopefully) evoking laughter.

==Pregnant pause==
A pregnant pause (as in the , &quot;many possibilities&quot;) is a technique of comic timing used to accentuate a comedy element, which uses comic pauses at the end of a phrase to build up suspense. It is often used at the end of a comically awkward statement or in the silence after a seemingly non-comic phrase to build up a comeback. Refined by Jack Benny, who introduced specific body language and a phrase in his pregnant pauses, the pregnant pause has become a staple of stand-up comedy.

<text>Keola Beamer (born Keolamaikalani Breckenridge Beamer February 18, 1951) is a Hawaiian slack-key guitar player, best known as the composer of &quot;Honolulu City Lights&quot; and an innovative musician who fused Hawaiian roots and contemporary music. Keola Beamer descends from one of Hawaii&#x27;s most respected musical families.

==Family==
Keola was born in Hawaii on February 18, 1951. His mother, Winona Beamer (&quot;Auntie Nona&quot;) was one of the most important figures in the revival of Hawaiian culture. She was a composer, dancer and educator. His ancestors were musicians for the previous five generations. He can trace his roots to the House of Kamehameha and Ahiakumai, 15th century rulers of Hawaii. His great-grandmother was Helen Desha Beamer, an influential songwriter and hula dancer. His father is Odell Steppe. Beamer is also a cancer survivor.

==Career==
Beamer&#x27;s career began in the early 1970s. His debut recording in 1972 was headlined &quot;Jack de Mello presents Keola Beamer&quot; and titled &quot;Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar in the Real Old Style&quot;, followed in the same year by an album with his brother Kapono in 1972. This second album was headlined &quot;Jack de Mello presents Keola and Kapono Beamer&quot; and titled &quot;This Is Our Island Home - We Are Her Sons,&quot; and subtitled &quot;Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar in the Real Old Style&quot;. The album featured traditional songs as well as songs composed by Keola, Kapono, and Winona. Keola and Kapono performed as a duo, mixing traditional materials and styles with mainland pop influences. In their seven albums over the next decade, they played an important part in establishing the style that came to be called &quot;Hawaiian contemporary,&quot; rooted in Hawaiian language and tradition but open to influences from elsewhere, incorporating rock, pop, Latin, folk-revival singer-songwriter, Hollywood soundtrack, and more. Their &#x27; 1978 LP &quot;Honolulu City Lights&quot; title song was a popular single in Hawaii, and in 2004 &quot;Honolulu Magazine&quot; placed the album first on a list of the fifty most important Hawaiian albums. In the 1980s, the brothers separated professionally, each producing award-winning records. After several pop-oriented albums, Keola connected with George Winston&#x27;s Dancing Cat recording project for five releases between 1994 and 2002, emphasizing slack key guitar and Hawaiian lyrics, but without abandoning &quot;contemporary&quot; influences. Beamer is influential as a teacher. He started offering lessons in the early 1970s, at a time when most players would only play for family members. About 1972, Keola and Kapono provided slack key guitar lessons at the Guitar and Lute Workshop, a custom guitar manufacturer and recording studio located near Ala Moana Shopping Center on Piikoi Street. &quot;In my early twenties, I was making guitars with George Gilmore and Donald Marienthal. We had the wild idea we could make nice guitars out of koa and mango wood so we took out a loan from the Small Business Administration and started the Guitar and Lute Workshop on Waimanu Street in Honolulu. People started coming in to ask about slack key. There were very few teachers back then, so I agreed to try it.&quot; Keola published an instruction manual entitled &quot;Hawaiian Slack Key&quot;. Teaching became his occupation for several years until he turned to full-time performing and composing.

In 1973 he published &quot;First Method for the Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar&quot; (the first instruction book for the form), and in the 1990s he produced several more instruction books and videos and started offering lessons on-line via his website. Since 2001, he has run a series of &quot;cultural immersion&quot; workshops dedicated not only to slack key but other aspects of Hawaiiana. Meanwhile, he has continued to tour and to release CDs on his own &#x27;Ohe Records label. In 2014, he was honored with a NACF Artist Fellowship for Music. He lives in Lahaina, Hawaii.

Beamer was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2012 under the Best Regional Roots Music Album category, which includes Hawaiian music. The same year the musical soundtrack for the motion picture movie &quot;Descendants&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Awards. Beamer played on and contributed to the work.

Beamer has influenced many guitar players.

<doc id="505972" wikidata="Q544041" url="?curid=505972" title="Coprolite">
<text>A coprolite (also known as a coprolith) is fossilized feces. Coprolites are classified as trace fossils as opposed to body fossils, as they give evidence for the animal&#x27;s behaviour (in this case, diet) rather than morphology. The name is derived from the Greek words κόπρος (&quot;kopros&quot;, meaning &quot;dung&quot;) and λίθος (&quot;lithos&quot;, meaning &quot;stone&quot;). They were first described by William Buckland in 1829. Before this, they were known as &quot;fossil fir cones&quot; and &quot;bezoar stones&quot;. They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms. Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to over 60 centimetres.

Coprolites, distinct from &quot;paleofeces&quot;, are fossilized animal dung. Like other fossils, coprolites have had much of their original composition replaced by mineral deposits such as silicates and calcium carbonates. Paleofeces, on the other hand, retain much of their original organic composition and can be reconstituted to determine their original chemical properties, though in practice the term coprolite is also used for ancient human fecal material in archaeological contexts. The study of coprolites in Japan was pioneered by Michiko Chiura.

==Initial discovery==

British fossil hunter Mary Anning noticed as early as 1824 that &quot;bezoar stones&quot; were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons found in the Lias formation at Lyme Regis. She also noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilized fish bones and scales as well as sometimes bones from smaller ichthyosaurs. These observations by Anning led the geologist William Buckland to propose in 1829 that the stones were fossilized feces and name them coprolites. Buckland also suspected that the spiral markings on the fossils indicated that ichthyosaurs had spiral ridges in their intestines similar to those of modern sharks and that some of these coprolites were black with ink from swallowed belemnites.

==Research value==

By examining coprolites, paleontologists are able to find information about the diet of the animal (if bones or other food remains are present), such as whether it was a herbivore or a carnivore, and the taphonomy of the coprolites, although the producer is rarely identified unambiguously, especially with more ancient examples. In some instances, knowledge about the anatomy of animals&#x27; digestive tracts can be helpful in assigning a coprolite to the animal that produced it, one example being the finding that the Triassic dinosauriform &quot;Silesaurus&quot; may have been an insectivore, a suggestion which was based on the beak-like jaws of the animal and the high density of beetle remains found in associated coprolites. Further, coprolites can be analyzed for certain minerals that are known to exist in trace amounts in certain species of plant that can still be detected millions of years later. In rare cases, coprolites have even been found to contain well-preserved insect remains. There is also a documented case of a coprolite containing an ichnofossil in the form of footprints of a crocodilian, created when a crocodilian stepped on the faecal matter before it became fossilised.

==Recognizing coprolites==

The recognition of coprolites is aided by their structural patterns, such as spiral or annular markings, content, undigested food fragments, and associated fossil remains. The smallest coprolites are often difficult to distinguish from inorganic pellets or from eggs. Most coprolites are composed chiefly of calcium phosphate, along with minor quantities of organic matter. By analyzing coprolites, it is possible to infer the diet of the animal which produced them.

Coprolites have been recorded in deposits ranging in age from the Cambrian period to recent times and are found worldwide. Some of them are useful as index fossils, such as &quot;Favreina&quot; from the Jurassic period of Haute-Savoie in France.

Some marine deposits contain a high proportion of fecal remains. However, animal excrement is easily fragmented and destroyed, so usually has little chance of becoming fossilized.

==Coprolite mining==
In 1842 the Rev John Stevens Henslow, a professor of botany at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, discovered coprolites just outside Felixstowe in Suffolk in the villages of Trimley St Martin, Falkenham and Kirton and investigated their composition. Realising their potential as a source of available phosphate once they had been treated with sulphuric acid, he patented an extraction process and set about finding new sources.

Very soon, coprolites were being mined on an industrial scale for use as fertiliser due to their high phosphate content. The major area of extraction occurred over the east of England, centred on Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely with its refining being carried out in Ipswich by the Fison Company. There is a Coprolite Street near Ipswich docks where the Fisons works once stood.

The industry declined in the 1880s but was revived briefly during the First World War to provide phosphates for munitions. A renewed interest in coprolite mining in the First World War extended the area of interest into parts of Buckinghamshire as far west as Woburn Sands.

Carrack rose to prominence in the mid-1970s as the frontman and principal songwriter of rock band Ace, and gained further recognition for his work as a solo artist and for his tenures as a member of Squeeze and Roger Waters&#x27; backing band, the Bleeding Heart Band, intermittently handling lead vocals on Squeeze and Waters recordings. From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, he enjoyed considerable success as the co-lead vocalist (with Sad Café&#x27;s Paul Young) and a songwriter for Mike + The Mechanics; following Young&#x27;s death in 2000, Carrack served as the band&#x27;s sole lead vocalist until his departure in 2004.

Carrack sang some of his affiliated bands&#x27; best-known hits, including Ace&#x27;s &quot;How Long&quot; (1975); Squeeze&#x27;s &quot;Tempted&quot; (1981); and Mike + The Mechanics&#x27; &quot;Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground)&quot; (1985), &quot;The Living Years&quot; (1988) and &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot; (1995). He also performed lead vocals on tracks from the Roger Waters albums &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot; (1990). He has released nineteen solo albums and achieved a major hit of his own with &quot;Don&#x27;t Shed a Tear&quot; (1988). Carrack&#x27;s songs have been recorded by artists such as Linda Ronstadt, Eagles, Diana Ross, Tom Jones, Michael McDonald and Jools Holland, and he has served as a session or touring musician for Roxy Music, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, B. B. King, the Pretenders, the Smiths and Madness.

==Career==
===1970s: Warm Dust, Ace and Roxy Music===
====Warm Dust====
Carrack&#x27;s recording career began with the jazz-rock band Warm Dust, which released three studio albums of original material between 1970 and 1972. Carrack served as the band&#x27;s keyboardist and occasionally played other instruments. The band&#x27;s lead vocalist was Les Walker. In addition to Carrack and Walker, the line up also included David Pepper, Alan Solomon, Terry Comer, and John Surguy. The original line-up was made up of Les Dransfield Walker on lead-vocals, harp, guitar, Carrack on organ, piano, guitar, Dave Pepper on drums and Terry Corner on bass, guitar and recorder. While playing the Top Ten club in Hamburg, they met up with John Surgey who played tenor sax and Alan Solomon who played baritone sax who subsequently joined the band.

They played at venues in Germany and their appearances in the UK were considered rare. It was on the continent that they fared better. They even appeared to have upstaged Fleetwood Mac at a concert. Three of their performances were recorded for &quot;Beat Club&quot;. They were &quot; Indian Rope Man&quot;, &quot;Worm Dance Part 1&quot; and &quot;Worm Dance Part 2&quot;.

====Ace====
After Warm Dust broke up, Carrack and Warm Dust bassist Terry &quot;Tex&quot; Comer helped found the pub rock band Ace. The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;How Long&quot;, was written and sung by Carrack and was a 1975 hit in both the UK and the United States. The track was Ace&#x27;s only hit record and in 1977 the group disbanded. Carrack then worked as a backing musician for Frankie Miller and as a keyboardist for Roxy Music.

===1980s: working solo and as a session musician===
Carrack&#x27;s debut solo studio album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Nightbird&quot;, was not a commercial success.

In 1981, Glenn Tilbrook recruited Carrack to join Squeeze as a replacement for long-time keyboardist Jools Holland. This new Squeeze line-up achieved international success with the studio album &quot;East Side Story&quot;, with Carrack as vocalist on the song &quot;Tempted&quot;, their biggest US hit at the time. However, by 1982, Carrack had left the band and was replaced by keyboardist Don Snow.

Beginning in late 1981, Carrack joined Nick Lowe in a band that featured Lowe, Carrack, Martin Belmont on guitar, James Eller on bass guitar and Bobby Irwin on drums. This band, referred to as Noise to Go, existed to back both Carrack on his solo recordings, and Lowe on his, similar to the arrangement Lowe had with Dave Edmunds and Rockpile in the late 1970s. Noise to Go also backed Lowe&#x27;s wife Carlene Carter on her 1981 studio album &quot;Blue Nun&quot;.

After Carrack&#x27;s 1982 solo studio album &quot;Suburban Voodoo&quot;, Eller left Noise to Go, and Lowe took over bass guitar duties within the band. The band was rechristened Nick Lowe and His Cowboy Outfit, and recorded two studio albums from 1983 to 1985, with Lowe as lead vocalist. The band also backed John Hiatt on side two of Hiatt&#x27;s 1983 studio album &quot;Riding with the King&quot;.

During this era, Carrack also worked as a session musician for the Smiths and the Pretenders.

Nick Lowe and His Cowboy Outfit broke up in 1985, and Carrack was contacted by Mike Rutherford of Genesis who asked him to join Rutherford&#x27;s new side project, Mike + The Mechanics. Initially, Carrack and Paul Young alternated as lead vocalists for the band. Carrack sang lead on their 1985 hit &quot;Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground)&quot;. This led to further mainstream popularity and acclaim, with Phil Collins describing Carrack as an &quot;incredible voice&quot; who &quot;could sing the telephone directory&quot;.

In 1986, Carrack became a member of Roger Waters&#x27; newly formed backing band, the Bleeding Heart Band, recording tracks for the soundtrack of the animated film &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;. The following year, Waters (still accompanied by Carrack and the Bleeding Hearts) released a solo studio album, &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; and toured the US and Europe. Carrack often filled in as an unofficial support act on the tour, usually playing &quot;Tempted&quot; to warm up the crowd.

Building on the success of Mike + The Mechanics, Carrack was able to reestablish his solo career in 1987 with the hit studio album &quot;One Good Reason&quot;, and the accompanying hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Shed a Tear&quot;, which reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. From this point forward, Carrack consistently maintained both a solo career and a career in Mike + The Mechanics. This band recorded and toured irregularly due to Rutherford&#x27;s commitments with Genesis.

In 1989, Mike + The Mechanics had a UK number two and US number one hit with &quot;The Living Years&quot;, on which Carrack again sang lead. Also in 1989, Carrack recorded &quot;Romance&quot;, a duet with Terri Nunn from the Los Angeles-based synth-pop band Berlin. The song appeared on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Sing&quot;, starring Peter Dobson and Lorraine Bracco.

===1990s: solo and collaborations===
In the 1990s Carrack&#x27;s solo career went into abeyance for a few years, although he maintained a career as a session musician. He also continued working with Mike + The Mechanics, who recorded throughout the decade. During this time Carrack played keyboards in the band and also began to co-compose, with Rutherford, some of the band&#x27;s songs.

In 1990, Carrack rejoined Roger Waters for the ground-breaking live stage show of &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot; in front of a crowd of 250,000. He sang &quot;Hey You&quot; and was one of the performers on &quot;The Tide Is Turning&quot; with Waters, Joni Mitchell, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams and Van Morrison.

In 1991, Carrack sang the fourth verse on Paul Young&#x27;s cover version of the Crowded House hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot;, released on Young&#x27;s compilation album &quot;From Time to Time – The Singles Collection&quot;.

In 1993, Carrack joined with bassist Tony Levin, drummer Steve Ferrone, guitarist Phil Palmer and keyboardist and producer Rupert Hine to form a band known as Spin 1ne 2wo. They released one album, a self-titled project, made up of classic rock covers including songs by Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Led Zeppelin, Blind Faith, Steely Dan and Bob Dylan. He dueted with Beth Nielsen Chapman on &quot;In the Time It Takes&quot;.

Also in 1993, Squeeze had Carrack return for their tenth studio album &quot;Some Fantastic Place&quot; and a subsequent tour. With Carrack on vocals, the band re-recorded their hit &quot;Tempted&quot; for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994). Carrack once again left Squeeze, however, after about a year.

Following his second stint with Squeeze, Carrack joined forces with Timothy B. Schmit and Don Felder of the Eagles for an ambitious, but ultimately unrealised, recording project. Schmit and Felder soon reunited with the rest of the Eagles and their &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; live album/studio album, bringing with them one of the songs Carrack had co-written, &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive.&quot; It was recorded by the Eagles and won an ASCAP award as being the most-played song in the US in 1995. The same year, Mike + The Mechanics scored yet another top 20 hit, &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot;. It not only featured Carrack on lead vocals, but was the first Mechanics hit to be co-written by him.

In 1996, Carrack resumed his solo career with the studio album &quot;Blue Views&quot;. Carrack also contributed Hammond organ parts to four songs on Ezio&#x27;s 2000 studio album &quot;Higher&quot;.

===2000–present===
Carrack maintains an active solo career, as well as his career as a session musician and songwriter, touring solo in 2002, mostly opening for bands such as Supertramp. He also served as the sole lead vocalist for Mike + The Mechanics following the death of Paul Young in 2000. In 2003 Carrack toured with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band performing his hit songs including &quot;How Long?&quot;, &quot;Tempted&quot; and &quot;The Living Years&quot;. In 2004, Carrack left the Mechanics following the release of &quot;Rewired&quot;, their only studio album with Carrack as sole lead vocalist. After a lull in Carrack&#x27;s career, in 2007 the Eagles covered Carrack&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Hear Anymore&quot; on their long-awaited reunion album &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;. The album went to number one in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries.

In September 2004, Carrack joined with other notable artists for &quot;The Strat Pack&quot; concert at Wembley, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster. Carrack delivered vocal performances on &quot;How Long?&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, and Genesis&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;.

In May 2009, Carrack embarked on a tour of Germany, supported by Canadian artist Brendan Croskerry. In 2010, Carrack released the studio album &quot;A Different Hat&quot;, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, arranged by David Cullen. Two years later in 2012, Carrack returned with the soul-inspired studio album &quot;Good Feeling&quot;.

In 2012, Carrack was the subject of an hour-long BBC Four television documentary &quot;Paul Carrack: The Man with the Golden Voice&quot;. In the same year, Carrack was one of the recipients of the BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of his unique contribution to music.

In February 2013, Carrack helped to kick off Eric Clapton&#x27;s 50th anniversary tour, &quot;Old Sock&quot;, celebrating the 50th year that Clapton had been a professional musician. Carrack sang lead vocals on &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;How Long&quot;, and closed the show with &quot;High Time We Went&quot;.

He also in 2013, took part in the BBC Four programme &quot;Please Please Me: Remaking a Classic&quot; to celebrate 50 years since the Beatles debut studio album, where he recorded his own version of &quot;Misery&quot;.

In May 2015, Carrack helped Clapton celebrate his 70th birthday with a concert held at Madison Square Garden on 1 and 3 May, along with the other members of Clapton&#x27;s band. The birthday celebration continued later in May at the Royal Albert Hall in the UK. In 2019, Carrack played Hammond organ and sang on Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Live in Concert 2019 world tour&quot;, playing their first-ever concert in Dresden, Germany as part of the Dresden Music Festival.

On 19 February 2021, a new single &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot; was released across all digital platforms via Carrack&#x27;s own independent label Carrack-UK. It was also announced that a new studio album, &quot;One on One&quot;, would be issued in June 2021. After Carrack contracted shingles in the spring, delaying the album&#x27;s completion, the release date was pushed back to September 17.

On the BBC&#x27;s 2024 &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot; he performed &quot;Over My Sholder&quot; with Jools Holland and the band.

<doc id="505975" wikidata="Q723572" url="?curid=505975" title="Cergy-le-Haut station">
<text>Cergy-le-Haut () is a railway station in Cergy, a western Paris suburb, that serves trains on the RER A line of the Réseau Express Régional network and Line L line of the Transilien network. 

The station was built in 1994 and is located underground in a shallow cut and cover tunnel. When first built, the station was located in an area of open fields, now built upon and is part of the network of stations serving the ville nouvelle of Cergy-Pontoise. It was part of a large project to develop the area and smart Parisian style buildings have been built next to the station around a plaza situated above the tracks. Cergy-le-Haut is not yet fully developed so fields are next to the station and next to seven-storey high apartment buildings.

During rush hours it is served by RER A trains every ten minutes and by Transilien Line L every ten minutes.

<text>Cergy-Préfecture station is a railway station in Cergy, France. The station was opened on and receives trains from Paris-Saint-Lazare as well as the RER A.

The station is underground and has two platforms. The entire area above and around the station is built up and the département council has its offices next to the station (hence the station&#x27;s name). The station is at the heart of a transport interchange at level -1 with the bus station at ground level. Level 1 is a large concrete slab plaza with shops and living apartments.

Cergy–Préfecture only has two platforms, with the platform situated between both tracks. Walls at platform level were painted with graffiti with messages of peace to discourage vandals. The general ambiance of the station is rather dark, but secure but CCTV monitoring the interchange.

Rail services link Cergy to Cergy-le-Haut and the Western Paris suburbs. Buses serve the ville nouvelle and particularly Pontoise and the rest of Val-d&#x27;Oise département.

<doc id="505982" wikidata="Q660384" url="?curid=505982" title="Mississippi Territory">
<text>The Territory of Mississippi was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that was created under an organic act passed by both upper and lower chambers (the Senate and House of Representatives) of the Congress of the United States, meeting at the United States Capitol on Capitol Hill, in the federal national capital city of Washington, D.C.. It was approved and signed into law by second President John Adams 1735-1826, served 1797-1801), on April 7, 1798.

The Territory was dissolved after 19 years on December 10, 1817, when the western half of the Territory was admitted to the Union as the new State of Mississippi. The eastern half was redesignated by the Congress and then 5th President James Monroe as the new Alabama Territory for the next two years, sandwiched between the new state of Mississippi in the west, Georgia to the east, Tennessee on the north, and to the south with a narrow strip of land to the Mobile Bay and Gulf of Mexico coast and further to the southeast of the western panhandle of the Royal Spanish colony of Spanish Florida in the Florida peninsula (future Florida Territory after 1819, and later state of Florida by 1845). 

The Territory of Alabama was admitted to the Union as the State of Alabama on December 14, 1819. The Chattahoochee River played a significant role in the definition of the Territory&#x27;s borders during its brief two years of existence, 1817-1819. 

The population greatly increased in the southeast United States with movement and immigration from the East Coast along the Atlantic Ocean as it grew in the early 1800s from settlement, and American westward and southwestward expansion from the original Thirteen States, with cotton being an important cash crop.

==History==
The United States and Spain disputed these lands east of the Mississippi River until Spain relinquished its claim with the Treaty of Madrid, initially signed in 1795 by the two countries&#x27; representatives. The Mississippi Territory was organized in 1798 from these lands, in an area extending from 31° N latitude to 32°28&#x27; North — or approximately the southern half of the present states of Alabama and Mississippi.

The state of Georgia had maintained a claim over almost the entire area of the present states of Alabama and Mississippi (from 31° N to 35° N), until it surrendered its claim in 1802 following the Yazoo land scandal. In 1804, Congress extended the boundaries of the Mississippi Territory to include all of the Georgia cession.

Beginning about 1808 the legislature of the Mississippi Territory held its official meetings in one of the houses owned by Charles DeFrance of the Natchez District. The DeFrance house, also known as Assembly Hall, was located in Washington, Mississippi, about 10 miles from the city of Natchez.

In 1812, the United States annexed the Mobile District of West Florida, between the Perdido River and the Pearl River. The U.S. declared that it had been included in the Louisiana Purchase (1803). But Spain disputed this and maintained its own claim over the area. 

The following year, a Federal statute was secretly enacted authorizing the President to take full possession of this area with the use of military force (&quot;and naval force&quot;) as deemed necessary. Accordingly, General James Wilkinson occupied this district with a military contingent; the Spanish colonial commandant offered no resistance. This annexation extended the Mississippi Territory south to the Gulf of Mexico, with the northern border being the boundary of the state of Tennessee, taking in all of what is now Alabama and Mississippi.

Federal statutes enacted on March 1 and 3, 1817, provided a plan for the division of the Mississippi Territory into the state of Mississippi in the west and the Alabama Territory in the east (with St. Stephens, on the Tombigbee River, as the temporary seat of the Alabama territorial government).
On December 10, 1817, the division was finalized when the western portion was admitted to the Union as Mississippi, the 20th state.

==Borders==
The final boundary between Georgia and Mississippi Territory was defined to follow the Chattahoochee River north from the border with Spanish Florida. However, the Chattahoochee&#x27;s upper course veers northeast, deep into Georgia. So the boundary was defined to follow the river until it turned northeast, and from that point to follow a straight line north to the 35th parallel (whose role in state borders dates back to the split of North and South Carolina in 1730). The line was not run straight north but rather angled to meet the northern border of the territory one-third of the way west, leaving the other two-thirds for two future states, Alabama and Mississippi (their angled boundary stopped at the Tennessee River).

Congress delineated the boundary between Mississippi and Alabama by dividing the territory into approximately equal-sized parts, similar in size to Georgia. The agriculturally productive lands were divided by a straight line running south from the northwest corner of Washington County (as it was defined at the time) to the Gulf of Mexico. The border north of this point was angled westward in order to keep Mississippi and Alabama roughly equal in size. At its northern end, this angled border follows a short section of the Tennessee River. Congress chose this boundary because if the straight line had been run all the way to the Tennessee border Mississippi would have jurisdiction over a small piece of hilly land cut off from the rest of the state by the wide Tennessee River.

==Settlement==
The attraction of vast amounts of high quality, inexpensive cotton land attracted hordes of settlers, mostly from Georgia and the Carolinas, and from tobacco areas of Virginia and North Carolina at a time when growing tobacco barely made a profit. From 1798 through 1820, the population soared from less than 9,000 to more than 22,000. Migration came in two fairly distinct waves – a steady movement until the outbreak of the War of 1812, and a flood afterward from 1815 through 1819. The postwar flood was caused by various factors, including high prices for cotton, the elimination of Indian titles to much of the land, new and improved roads, and the acquisition of new direct outlets to the Gulf of Mexico. The first migrants were traders and trappers, then herdsmen, and finally planters. The uplands in the Southwest frontier developed a relatively democratic society.

In the 1810 United States census, 11 counties in the Mississippi Territory (8 in Mississippi and 3 in Alabama) reported the following population counts (after only 3 reported the following counts in the 1800 United States census):
===Cotton===
After 1800, the development of a cotton economy in the South changed the economic relationship of native Indians with whites and slaves in Mississippi Territory. As Native Americans ceded their lands to whites, they became more isolated from whites and blacks. A great wave of public sales of former Indian land plus white migration (with slaves) into Mississippi Territory guaranteed the dominance of the developing cotton agriculture.

===Government===
President John Adams appointed Winthrop Sargent as the first governor of the Mississippi Territory, effective from May 1798 to May 1801. William C. C. Claiborne (1775–1817), a lawyer and former Democratic-Republican Congressman from Tennessee (1797–1801), was governor and superintendent of Indian affairs in the Mississippi Territory from 1801 through 1803. Although he favored acquiring some land from the Choctaw and Chickasaw, Claiborne was generally sympathetic and conciliatory toward the Indians. He worked long and patiently to iron out differences that arose, and to improve the material well-being of the Indians. He was also partly successful in promoting the establishment of law and order, as when his offering of a two thousand dollar reward helped destroy a gang of outlaws headed by Samuel Mason (1750–1803). His position on issues indicated a national rather than regional outlook, though he did not ignore his constituents. Claiborne expressed the philosophy of the Republican Party and helped that party defeat the Federalists. When a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Spring of 1802, Claiborne&#x27;s actions resulted in the first recorded mass vaccination in the territory and saved Natchez from the disease.

George Mathews, a former governor of Georgia, was appointed the governorship, though the appointment was revoked before he took office. The third governor was Robert Williams, serving from May 1805 to March 1809.

David Holmes was the last governor of the Mississippi Territory, 1809–17. Holmes was generally successful in dealing with a variety of matters, including expansion, land policy, Indians, the War of 1812, and the constitutional convention of 1817 (of which he was elected president). Often concerned with problems regarding West Florida, he had a major role in 1810 in negotiations which led to the peaceful occupation of part of that territory. McCain (1967) concludes that Holmes&#x27; success was not based on brilliance, but upon kindness, unselfishness, persuasiveness, courage, honesty, diplomacy, and intelligence.

The eastern half of the Mississippi Territory was labeled the Tombigbee District and later Washington County. Ignored by the territorial government, the inhabitants were beset by hostile neighbors, militant Indians, and the usual frontier problems of competing land claims and establishment of law. Solutions to these difficulties came slowly, and were not completely resolved when the territory gained statehood as the U.S. state of Alabama in 1819.

===Law===
English common law dominated the development of the judicial system in the Mississippi Territory. The citizenry considered the laws imposed by Winthrop Sargent, the territory&#x27;s governor, as repressive and unconstitutional. &#x27;Sargent&#x27;s Code,&#x27; however unpopular, established the first court system for the territory and served as the precedent for later revisions. The area was in a dire need of competent judges at the end of the 18th century, at a time when the governor and three judges were supposed to write law to govern the new territory. In 1798, Sargent wrote to Timothy Pickering, Secretary of State, that this was his &quot;great source of uneasiness&quot;; he was anxiously awaiting the arrival of a new judge, William McGuire—but McGuire, who did not get to the territory in the fall of 1799, went back to his home in Virginia after only a couple of weeks. The two other judges were Judge Tilton, a man who had never practiced law and may have studied law only for a year (he left after an early disagreement with the governor, returning later for a brief spell), and Judge Bruin, a merchant of whom Sargent said he was &quot;a worthy and sensible man [but] beyond doubt deficient&quot;. &quot;Aside from his innocence of legal knowledge, [he] was so often drunk or absent or both&quot; (and had to resign to avoid impeachment), according to the reviewer of a 1954 study by William Baskerville Hamilton on Thomas Rodney, the federal judge who arrived in the territory in 1803 and helped organize it until his death in 1811.

An 1802 judiciary act considerably simplified the court system. Several judicial reorganization acts followed in 1805, 1809, and 1814, though a modified form of Sargent&#x27;s county court system and the considerable power held by judges continued. While the credentials of the members of the first territorial court were questionable, the quality of judges in later courts steadily grew.

===Religion===
While the Roman Catholic Church, planted during the French and Spanish colonial periods, was active along the coast, after 1799 more American Protestants entered the territory, bringing their religious varieties with them. Free thought, skepticism, deism, or indifference to religion were characteristic of the wealthy planters and land speculators, as newcomers were far more interested in seeking riches in this world than in the next. As the number of American migrants increased, Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians formed the three leading denominations in the territory. Protestant ministers won converts, often promoted education, and had some influence in improving the treatment of slaves.

===War of 1812===
The people of the Mississippi Territory favored war with Britain in 1812. By 1810, belief in the national policy of economic coercion was waning in what was then called the Southwest, while desire for unrestricted trade and a vindication of national honor was rising, intermingled with desire for Spanish Florida. However, problems of land claims, Indians, internal improvements, and statehood issues continued to excite more local interest than the coming of war. Most saw no conflict between war issues and local interests; in fact, some foresaw war as a way of resolving certain local problems.

Following a successful attack on a white expedition at the Battle of Burnt Corn, the Red Sticks, a hostile faction of the Creeks, determined to attack and destroy Fort Mims in the eastern part Mississippi Territory (modern Alabama). Poor scouting, an attack at noon when most of the garrison was eating, seizure of the portholes by the Indians, and inability to close the main gates were all elements in the defeat on August 30, 1813. Of the 275 to 300 whites and multiracial people in Fort Mims at the time of the attack, between 20 and 40 escaped; therefore, about 235 to 260 whites and friendly Indians were killed in the battle. Creek losses were at least 100 killed.

The massacre had significant short- and long-range effects. It triggered a major Indian war that involved a substantial build-up of American military force in the area – which probably prevented the British from occupying an undefended Gulf coast in 1814. More importantly, relations between Americans and the southern Indians changed drastically. The Creeks, who had been living peacefully and in close contact with the settlers of the Mississippi Territory, lost more than half their land, and within twenty years were forced to move west of the Mississippi River.

Brigadier General Ferdinand L. Claiborne, commander of the Mississippi militia, was not to blame for the massacre, but Major Daniel Beasley was guilty of gross negligence. At the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on March 27, 1814, American forces and Indian allies under General Andrew Jackson defeated the Red Sticks, killing most of the warriors and sending the rest fleeing to Florida, where they joined the Seminole tribe.

<text>The Ocean University of China () is a public university in Qingdao, Shandong, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction. 

While offering studies in various branches of natural and social sciences alongside engineering, the university is especially renowned for its marine sciences and fishery sciences departments. 

The university celebrated its centenary on October 25, 2024 organising a mega event.

==History==
Shortly after China recovered sovereignty over Shandong, the university was set up in 1924 as the Private Qingdao University (私立青岛大学). This new higher education institute was located at the site of the former German Bismarck Barracks and was mostly financed by wealthy donors. Success was only short-lived though, as the Republic of China was ravaged by internal strife that had a disrupting effect on the university too. Under the warlord Zhang Zongchang, it became a part of Shandong University. Zhang was defeated shortly thereafter in August 1928, and operations of Shandong University were shut down for a time. In 1930 it was reopened as Qingdao division of Shandong University (国立山东大学(青岛)), and included two colleges, one for literature and one for science. The following years, programs were expanded, and in 1936 the number of students had reached 411. With the Japanese threat of occupation lurking, the university staff and students moved to Sichuan in 1937, where they transferred to other schools.

After the end of the Second World War, the university continued to function as the Qingdao branch of Shandong University. The number of colleges grew to five, and by 1951 the number of students had reached 2.366. Later in the decade, a number of courses in medical sciences and hospitals were removed from the university and set up in the Qingdao Medical School (that would later form a constituent of Qingdao University).

The biggest reshuffling of academic subjects started in 1959, when the maritime science departments of different universities, including Fudan University and Xiamen University were moved to Qingdao. The university was removed from the supervision of Shandong University and placed directly unter the Ministry of Education to form the Shandong College of Oceanology (). It was one of the National Key Universities that were named in October 1960 and as enjoyed a high level of support and funding. In January 1988 it was renamed the Ocean University of Qingdao (). Deng Xiaoping wrote the name of the university in his own calligraphic style to mark the occasion. In October 2002, it was renamed the Ocean University of China.

==Location==


The first campus of Haida is the site of former German Bismarck Barracks which is known as Yushan Campus (). It is situated on a hill with a view of the sea in the previous German Concession part of Shinan District. Featuring German-style architecture built in the early 1920s, it is especially renowned for its beauty. The surrounding area is a popular tourist destination that includes several churches and Zhan Qiao pier.

Fushan campus is located adjacent to Qingdao University and is by far the smallest constituent part, since most departments moved to the newest campus in Laoshan District that was opened in the fall of 2006. Taken together, the university covers a combined area of more than 733,000 m2, and has a floor space of 230,000 m2.

**Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2016 etc.

It was established under the provisions of Maharashtra Prevention of Water Pollution Act, 1969.

Some of the important functions of MPCB are;

* To plan comprehensive program for the prevention, control or abatement of pollution and secure executions thereof,
* To collect and disseminate information relating to pollution and the prevention, control or abatement thereof,
* To inspect sewage or trade effluent treatment and disposal facilities, and air pollution control systems and to review plans, specification or any other data relating to the treatment plants, disposal systems and air pollution control systems in connection with the consent granted,
* Supporting and encouraging the developments in the fields of pollution control, waste recycle reuse, eco-friendly practices etc.
* To educate and guide the entrepreneurs in improving environment by suggesting appropriate pollution control technologies and techniques
* Creation of public awareness about the clean and healthy environment and attending the public complaints regarding pollution.

== Criticism ==
During a hearing of a PIL on the Panchganga river pollution, the court find that successive state governments had not appointed members for the board since its establishment on 7 September 1970. The appointment of board members is obligatory as stipulated in the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. There is no data available whether the government has ever appointed members other than the secretary-level officers.

<doc id="505992" wikidata="Q5327149" url="?curid=505992" title="Earth battery">
<text>An earth battery is a pair of electrodes made of two dissimilar metals, such as iron and copper, which are buried in the soil or immersed in the sea. Earth batteries act as water-activated batteries. If the plates are sufficiently far apart, they can tap telluric currents . Earth batteries are sometimes referred to as telluric power sources and telluric generators.

==History==
One of the earliest examples of an earth battery was built by Alexander Bain in 1841 in order to drive a &quot;&quot;—a device that transforms the flow or changes in pressure of a fluid into mechanical energy. Bain buried plates of zinc and copper in the ground about one meter apart and used the resulting voltage, of about one volt, to operate a clock. Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had researched Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and Carl August von Steinheil, who built one of the first electric clocks and developed the idea of an &quot;Earth return&quot; (or &quot;ground return&quot;), had previously investigated such devices.

Daniel Drawbaugh received for an Earth battery for electric clocks (with several improvements in the art of Earth batteries). Another early patent was obtained by Emil Jahr &quot;Method of utilizing electrical Earth currents&quot;). In 1875, James C. Bryan received for his &quot;Earth Battery&quot;. In 1885, George Dieckmann, received US patent for his &quot;Electric Earth battery&quot;. In 1898, Nathan Stubblefield received for his electrolytic coil battery, which was a combination of an earth battery and a solenoid. (For more information see US patents , , , , , , and .) The Earth battery, in general, generated power for early telegraph transmissions and formed part of a tuned circuit that amplified the signalling voltage over long distances.

==Operation and use==
The simplest earth batteries consist of conductive plates from different metals of the electropotential series, buried in the ground so that the soil acts as the electrolyte in a voltaic cell. As such, the device acts as a primary cell. When operated only as electrolytic devices, the devices were not continuously reliable, owing to drought condition. These devices were used by early experimenters as energy sources for telegraphy. However, in the process of installing long telegraph wires, engineers discovered that there were electrical potential differences between most pairs of telegraph stations, resulting from natural electrical currents (called telluric currents) flowing through the ground. Some early experimenters did recognize that these currents were, in fact, partly responsible for extending the earth batteries&#x27; high outputs and long lifetimes. Later, experimenters would utilize these currents alone and, in these systems, the plates became polarized.

It had been long known that continuous electric currents flowed through the solid and liquid portions of the Earth, and the collection of current from an electrically conductive medium in the absence of electrochemical changes (and in the absence of a thermoelectric junction) was established by Lord Kelvin. Lord Kelvin&#x27;s &quot;sea battery&quot; &quot;was not&quot; a chemical battery. Lord Kelvin observed that such variables as placement of the electrodes in the magnetic field and the direction of the medium&#x27;s flow affected the current output of his device. Such variables do not affect battery operation. When metal plates are immersed in a liquid medium, energy can be obtained and generated, including (but not limited to) methods known via magneto-hydrodynamic generators. In the various experiments by Lord Kelvin, metal plates were symmetrically perpendicular to the direction of the medium&#x27;s flow and were carefully placed with respect to a magnetic field, which differentially deflected electrons from the flowing stream. The electrodes can be asymmetrically oriented with respect to the source of energy, though.

To obtain the natural electricity, experimenters would thrust two metal plates into the ground at a certain distance from each other in the direction of a magnetic meridian, or astronomical meridian. The stronger currents flow from south to north. This phenomenon possesses a considerable uniformity of current strength and voltage. As the Earth currents flow from south to north, electrodes are positioned, beginning in the south and ending in the north, to increase the voltage at as large a distance as possible. In many early implementations, the cost was prohibitive because of an over-reliance on extreme spacing between electrodes.

It has been found that all the common metals behave relatively similarly. The two spaced electrodes, having a load in an external circuit connected between them, are disposed in an electrical medium, and energy is imparted to the medium in such manner that &quot;&quot;free electrons&quot; in the medium are excited. The free electrons then flow into one electrode to a greater degree than in the other electrode, thereby causing electric current to flow in the external circuit through the load. The current flows from that plate whose position in the electropotential series is near the negative end (such as palladium). The current produced is highest when the two metals are most widely separated from each other in the electropotential series, and when the material nearer the positive end is to the north, while that at the negative end is towards the south. The plates, one copper and another iron or carbon, are connected above ground by means of a wire with as little resistance as possible. In such an arrangement, the electrodes are not appreciably chemically corroded, even when they are in earth saturated with water, and are connected together by a wire for a long time.

It had been found that to strengthen the current, it was most advantageous to drive the northerly electropositive electrode deeper into the medium than the southerly electrode. The greatest currents and voltages were obtained when the difference in depth was such that a line joining the two electrodes was in the direction of the magnetic dip, or magnetic inclination. When the previous methods were combined, the current was tapped and utilized in any well-known manner.

In some cases, a pair of plates with differing electrical properties, and with suitable protective coatings, were buried below the ground. A protective or other coating covered each entire plate. A copper plate could be coated with powdered coke, a processed carbonaceous material. To a zinc plate, a layer of felt could be applied. To use the natural electricity, earth batteries fed electromagnets, the load, that were part of a motor mechanism.

<doc id="505997" wikidata="Q3859191" url="?curid=505997" title="Miss Victory">
<text>Miss Victory is an American superheroine who first appeared in &quot;Captain Fearless&quot; #1 (Aug. 1941), published by Frank Z. Temerson&#x27;s Helnit Publishing Co. Ceasing to be published after 1946, she was revived and updated in 1984 as a central character in the &quot;Femforce&quot; comic-book series published by A.C. Comics.

Fall 1941 was a boom period for patriotic superheroes as the country prepared to enter World War II; during this period, comic book publishers also launched Wonder Woman, Captain America, Miss America, the Star-Spangled Kid, U.S. Jones, the Fighting Yank, the Flag, Captain Flag and Yank and Doodle, among others.

==Publication history==
Introduced during the period fans and historians term the Golden Age of Comic Books, the original Miss Victory was created in &quot;Captain Fearless&quot; #1 (Aug. 1941) in an untitled, five-page story generally indexed with its opening words, &quot;Introducing Miss Victory&quot;, probably written by Alberta Tews and drawn by Charles Quinlan. She went on to appear in the second and final issue of &quot;Captain Fearless&quot;. Contrary to some sources, she did not appear in Helnit&#x27;s first issue of &quot;Captain Aero&quot;, but after Holyoke Publishing took over the series from Helnit her second story was reprinted in vol. 1 #12 (#6 on cover) and in new stories beginning with the following issue, vol 2 #1 (#7 on cover).

Given no formal origin story, it was left unexplained as to how Miss Victory was able to survive explosions, break free of ropes, or knock down walls, but is clear that in her introduction she had superhuman strength and durability.

According to &quot;Jess Nevins&#x27; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&quot;, &quot;her opponents range from ordinary criminals to Germans to pretend talking apes to Japanese Yellow Peril femmes fatale&quot;.

She remained as star of a backup feature in the sporadically published &quot;Captain Aero Comics&quot; as the title returned to Temerson&#x27;s control in 1943. In 1944, the strip was drawn by Nina Albright, who redesigned her costume in issue #17 (Oct 1944) to increase the character&#x27;s sex appeal, trading in the blouse for a halter top.

The character last appeared in &quot;Captain Aero Comics&quot;&#x27; final issue, #26 (Aug. 1946).

In 1984, the character was revived by writer Bill Black and penciler Mark Heike in AC Comics&#x27; &quot;Femforce Special&quot; #1 (Fall 1984).

==Fictional character biography==
Miss Victory was secretly stenographer Joan Wayne, whose work in a Government department, coupled with her desire to help the war effort, led her to don the patriotic guise of Miss Victory: a tight-fitting, red-white-and-blue costume with a plunging neckline and a V emblem across her chest.

The 1984-revival version also possesses superhuman strength, as well as the ability to fly over short distances. Her true identity is Dr. Joan Wayne, a research scientist in the United States Department of Defense, who in the 1940s developed the &quot;V-47 formula&quot; to increase the strength/stamina of allied troops. The formula, however, only worked on Joan herself, and she became a superheroine. The formula also prevented her from aging, so that the Miss Victory of today is still a young, attractive woman.

Miss Victory received an overdose of the related but faulty V-45 formula from the Black Commando which affected her personality, transforming her into the villainous Rad. Eventually, the V-45 formula was removed from her system and she returned to Femforce. In the mid 1990s, Wayne temporarily resigned her leadership of Femforce, and was replaced by her grown daughter Jennifer, the only other person on whom the V-47 formula would work. Jennifer was referred to as the second Miss Victory. After Joan returned to the Miss Victory role, Jennifer eventually took V-45 and became the second Rad. Jennifer (as Rad) is not really a villain, but more of an anti-hero. In addition to her daughter, Miss Victory&#x27;s family consists of husband, fellow hero Captain Paragon and a cloned son of the couple created by an enemy.

<text>GNU Sharutils is a set of utilities to handle shell archives. The GNU shar utility produces a single file out of many files and prepares them for transmission by electronic mail services, for example by converting binary files into plain ASCII text.

A shell archive is a collection of files that can be unpacked by the Bourne shell. A wide range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing shar archives and in specifying shar smartness. For example, shar may compress files, uuencode binary files, split long files and construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and provide md5sum or byte count verification.

GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of shell archives. It will automatically strip off the mail headers and other introductory text. The archive bodies are then unpacked by a copy of the shell. unshar may also process files containing concatenated shell archives.

<doc id="506003" wikidata="Q2411447" url="?curid=506003" title="The Folk Implosion">
<text>The Folk Implosion is an American band founded in the early 1990s by Lou Barlow and John Davis. It was initially a side-project started by Barlow to explore different territory than that which was being canvassed with his primary band at the time, Sebadoh. The name is a play on the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The band was on hiatus from 2004 to 2020.

==History==
Following the release of Sebadoh&#x27;s &quot;Bubble and Scrape&quot; in 1993, Barlow received a tape from Davis, songwriter and librarian, that kicked off their collaboration as a songwriting team and studio recording project. The Folk Implosion released &quot;Walk Through This World with the Folk Implosion&quot; on cassette in 1993 on the Communion Label and as a 7-inch EP in 1994 on Drunken Fish.

The band&#x27;s status was relatively obscure before Larry Clark&#x27;s film &quot;Kids&quot;, and its soundtrack, most of which contained original compositions by Barlow and Davis. Both Sebadoh and Folk Implosion contributed to the soundtrack, with the track &quot;Daddy Never Understood&quot; attributed to Deluxx Folk Implosion. Deluxx Folk Implosion included Barlow, Davis, and members of the band Deluxx, Bob Fay and Mark Peretta. The introduction of Fay and Peretta to the band allowed the Folk Implosion to realize its songs live.

&quot;Natural One&quot;, one of the Folk Implosion songs from the &quot;Kids&quot; soundtrack, became a hit single. It peaked at no. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, no. 4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Charts and no. 20 on the Mainstream Rock Charts. The track peaked at no. 45 in the UK Singles Chart. The video for &quot;Natural One&quot; was included in MTV&#x27;s Buzz Bin.

In 1995, the band contributed the song &quot;Indierockinstrumental&quot; to &quot;Red Hot + Bothered&quot;, a benefit album for people with AIDS, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

In 1996, the band covered the song &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Bill&quot; from &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks&quot; as &quot;Deluxx Folk Implosion&quot;.

Though the band attempted to duplicate the success of &quot;Natural One&quot;, their subsequent releases were not as successful. &quot;Dare to Be Surprised&quot; was released by Communion in 1997 and received 6/10 when reviewed in SPIN Magazine. The group had started work on the album in 1995 before &quot;Natural One&quot; was released. After the success of the Kids Soundtrack, Folk Implosion signed to Interscope Records and recorded the 1999 studio album &quot;One Part Lullaby.&quot; The lead single &quot;Free to Go&quot; peaked moderately in both the US and UK. While the album was well reviewed, Barlow and Davis chose not to tour for the album and the project in its original incarnation slowed to an end.

After Davis left the band in 2000, Barlow recruited Russ Pollard and Imaad Wasif from the band Alaska! to record &quot;The New Folk Implosion&quot;. In 2002, the band appeared as the backing musicians for the main character played by Alessandro Nivola in the film &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot;.

John Davis returned to teaching and began to release music again as a solo artist in 2013.

In 2021, the band begun recording new material, and played a small acoustic set live. They also released an expanded edition of the &quot;Walk Through This World&quot; EP on Bandcamp on September 11, 2021. The following year, the band released the &quot;Feel It If You Feel It&quot; single, followed by the &quot;It Just Goes With&quot; EP in March 2023, and it was their first new material in nearly 20 years. A few months later, Folk Implosion released &quot;Music for Kids&quot;. It consisted of the band&#x27;s contributions to the &quot;Kids&quot; soundtrack in addition to other songs recorded during the same era.

Members are elected by first-past-the-post voting with one member from each federal constituency. Members hold their seats until the Dewan Rakyat is dissolved, the term of which is constitutionally limited to five years after an election. The number of seats each state or territory is entitled to is fixed by Article 46 of the Constitution.

While the concurrence of both chambers of Parliament is normally necessary for legislation to be enacted, the Dewan Rakyat holds significantly more power in practice; the Dewan Negara very rarely rejects bills that have been passed by the Dewan Rakyat and the Dewan Rakyat can bypass the Dewan Negara if it refuses to pass a specific law twice, with at least one year in between. The Cabinet is solely responsible to the Dewan Rakyat, and the prime minister only has to maintain the support of the lower house.

== History ==
The history of the Dewan Rakyat can be traced back during the Federal Legislative Council era. At that time, 52 out of the 100-member council were elected directly by the people using first-past-the-post system, returning one representatives from each constituencies. The council was dissolved in 1959, a year ahead of its expiration term to pave the way for a new election for the new Dewan Rakyat, which was to be the lower house of the Parliament of Malaysia.

The voting system was retained from the previous election, and has since taken place in the subsequent elections post-independence. The number of seats increased to 104, abolishing the nominated seats in favour of elected members. The ruling Alliance returned as the Government with a majority of 44 seats. Tunku Abdul Rahman reelected as the Prime Minister, while the new Parliament convened on 2 September 1959.

After the formation of Malaysia, a special autonomy status allowing representatives from Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore to be elected indirectly by the state assemblies. Therefore, in 1964 elections, only 65% of the total seats were contested. The Alliance retained its position with a higher margin.

The 1969 elections marked the first time Alliance failed to win a supermajority and majority popular vote. The racial unrests resulted in the Parliament being suspended until 1971. Upon the reopening of the Parliament, the Alliance returned with a supermajority government after Bornean local parties, PAS and GERAKAN joined the coalition, later to be known as Barisan Nasional.

==Membership==
Members are referred to as &quot;Member of Parliament&quot; (&quot;MPs&quot;) or &quot;&quot; () in Malay. The term of office is as long as the member wins in the elections.

A member of the Dewan Rakyat must be at least 18 years of age, which was lowered from 21 when the Dewan Rakyat passed the Bill to amend Article 47 of the Federal Constitution in 2019, and must not concurrently be a member of the Dewan Negara. The presiding officer of the Dewan Rakyat is the Speaker, who is elected at the beginning of each Parliament or after the vacation of the post, by the MPs. Two Deputy Speakers are also elected, and one of them sits in place of the Speaker when he is absent. The Dewan Rakyat machinery is supervised by the Clerk of the House who is appointed by the King; he may only be removed from office through the manner prescribed for judges or by mandatory retirement at age 60.

As of the 2018 general election, the Dewan Rakyat has 222 elected members. Members are elected from federal constituencies drawn by the Election Commission. Constituency boundaries are redrawn every ten years based on the latest census.

Each Dewan Rakyat lasts for a maximum of five years, after which a general election must be called. In the general election, voters select a candidate to represent their constituency in the Dewan Rakyat. The first-past-the-post voting system is used; the candidate who gains the most votes wins the seat.

Before a general election can be called, the King must first dissolve Parliament on the advice of the Prime Minister. According to the Constitution, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong has the right at his own discretion to either grant or withhold consent to dissolve the parliament.

==Powers and procedure==
Parliament is the legislative branch of the federal government and is responsible for passing, amending and repealing primary legislation. These are known as Acts of Parliament.

Members of Parliament possess parliamentary privilege and are permitted to speak on any subject without fear of censure outside Parliament; the only body that can censure an MP is the House Committee of Privileges. Immunity is effective from the moment a member of Parliament is sworn in, and only applies when that member has the floor; it does not apply to statements made outside the House. An exception is made by the Sedition Act passed by Parliament in the wake of the 13 May racial riots in 1969. Under the Act, all public discussion of repealing certain Articles of the Constitution dealing with Bumiputra privileges such as Article 153 is illegal. This prohibition is extended to all members of both houses of Parliament. Members of Parliament are also forbidden from criticising the King and judges.

The executive government, comprising the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, is usually drawn from members of Parliament; most of its members are typically members of the Dewan Rakyat. After a general election or the resignation or death of a Prime Minister, the King selects the Prime Minister, who is the head of government but constitutionally subordinate to him, from the Dewan Rakyat. In practice, this is usually the leader of the largest party in Parliament. The Prime Minister then submits a list containing the names of members of his Cabinet, who will then be appointed as Ministers by the King. Members of the Cabinet must also be members of Parliament. If the Prime Minister loses the confidence of the Dewan Rakyat, whether by losing a no-confidence vote or failing to pass a budget, he must either advise the King to dissolve Parliament and hold a general election or submit his resignation to the King. The King has the discretion to grant or withhold consent to the dissolution. If consent is withheld, the government must resign and the King would appoint a new Prime Minister that has the support of the majority of members of Parliament. The Cabinet formulates government policy and drafts bills, meeting in private. Its members must accept &quot;collective responsibility&quot; for the decisions the Cabinet makes, even if some members disagree with it; if they do not wish to be held responsible for Cabinet decisions, they must resign. Although the Constitution makes no provision for it, there is also a Deputy Prime Minister, who is the &quot;de facto&quot; successor of the Prime Minister should he die or be otherwise incapacitated.

A proposed act of law begins its life when a particular government minister or ministry prepares a first draft with the assistance of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department. The draft, known as a bill, is then discussed by the Cabinet. If it is agreed to submit it to Parliament, the bill is distributed to all MPs. It then goes through three readings before the Dewan Rakyat. The first reading is where the minister or his deputy submits it to Parliament. At the second reading, the bill is discussed and debated by MPs. At the third reading, the minister or his deputy formally submit it to a vote for approval. A simple majority is usually required to pass the bill, but in certain cases, such as amendments to the constitution, a two-thirds majority is required. Should the bill pass, it is sent to the Dewan Negara, where the three readings are carried out again. The Dewan Negara may choose not to pass the bill, but this only delays its passage by a month, or in some cases, a year; once this period expires, the bill is considered to have been passed by the house.

If the bill passes, it is presented to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who has 30 days to consider the bill. Should he disagree with it, he returns it to Parliament with a list of suggested amendments. Parliament must then reconsider the bill and its proposed amendments and return it to the King within 30 days if they pass it again. The King then has another 30 days to give the royal assent; otherwise, it passes into law. The law does not take effect until it is published in the Government Gazette.

The government attempts to maintain top secrecy regarding bills debated; MPs generally receive copies of bills only a few days before they are debated, and newspapers are rarely provided with copies of the bills before they are debated. In some cases, such as a 1968 amendment to the Constitution, an MP may be presented with a bill to be debated on the same day it is tabled, and all three readings may be carried out that day itself. In rare circumstances, the government may release a White paper containing particular proposals that will eventually be incorporated into a bill; this has been done for legislation such as the Universities and University Colleges Act.

Although the process above assumes only the government can propose bills, there also exists a process for private member&#x27;s bills. However, unlike most other legislatures following the Westminster system, few members of Parliament actually introduce bills. To present a private member&#x27;s bill, the member in question must seek the leave of the House in question to debate the bill before it is moved. Originally, it was allowed to debate the bill in the process of seeking leave, but this process was discontinued by an amendment to the Standing Orders of the Dewan Rakyat. It is also possible for members of the Dewan Negara to initiate bills; however, only cabinet ministers are permitted to move finance-related bills, which must be tabled in the Dewan Rakyat.

It is often alleged that legislation proposed by the opposition parties, which must naturally be in the form of a private member&#x27;s bill, is not seriously considered by Parliament. Some have gone as far as to claim that the rights of members of Parliament to debate proposed bills have been severely curtailed by incidents such as an amendment of the Standing Orders that permitted the Speaker to amend written copies of MPs&#x27; speeches before they were made. Nevertheless, it is admitted by some of these critics that &quot;government officials often face sharp questioning in Parliament, although this is not always reported in detail in the press.&quot;

=== Special Chamber ===

In 2016, Speaker Pandikar Amin Mulia introduced a Special Chamber of the Dewan Rakyat which holds proceedings separately from the main house, to &quot;allow matters of national importance or urgency to be discussed without interrupting the normal proceedings of the Lower House.&quot; Government and opposition leaders both welcomed the move, with Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department Azalina Othman Said, Democratic Action Party whip Anthony Loke, and People&#x27;s Justice Party whip Johari Abdul issuing favourable statements to the press. Amendments to the Standing Orders of the Dewan Rakyat in April 2016 established the Special Chamber to host debates on &quot;any matter of administration for which the government is responsible&quot; or &quot;a defined matter of urgent public importance&quot;.

Liew Chin Tong, at the time an opposition Member of Parliament, claimed he had lobbied Pandikar to institute the Special Chamber, which he has said takes inspiration from both the Australian and British parliaments. Liew has proposed expanding the remit of the Special Chamber: &quot;A full-fledged second chamber should take away all constituency-specific issues off the main chamber and move them to the second chamber so that the main chamber focuses only on the most important things.&quot; When he and Pandikar spoke at a panel on parliamentary reform in 2021, Liew also proposed expanding the amount of time allotted for Special Chamber debates: &quot;Currently, only two speeches of seven and a half minutes each by backbenchers or opposition MPs with replies from government of equal time are permitted, amounting to only 30 minutes each day.&quot;

In 2023, after being elected Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat, Johari announced that the Special Chamber would double the number of motions permitted per session from two to four. He also announced that opposition and government backbencher MPs would be allowed to preside over the Special Chamber, instead of limiting the chair to just the Speaker and Deputy Speakers.

<text>An image schema (both &quot;schemas&quot; and &quot;schemata&quot; are used as plural forms) is a recurring structure within our cognitive processes which establishes patterns of understanding and reasoning. As an understudy to embodied cognition, image schemas are formed from our bodily interactions, from linguistic experience, and from historical context. The term is introduced in Mark Johnson&#x27;s book &quot;The Body in the Mind&quot;; in case study 2 of George Lakoff&#x27;s &quot;Women, Fire and Dangerous Things:&quot; and further explained by Todd Oakley in &quot;The Oxford handbook of cognitive linguistics;&quot; by Rudolf Arnheim in &quot;Visual Thinking&quot;; by the collection &quot;From Perception to Meaning: Image Schemas in Cognitive Linguistics&quot; edited by Beate Hampe and Joseph E. Grady.

In contemporary cognitive linguistics, an image schema is considered an embodied prelinguistic structure of experience that motivates conceptual metaphor mappings. Learned in early infancy they are often described as spatiotemporal relationships that enable actions and describe characteristics of the environment. They exist both as static and dynamic version, describing both states and processes, compare Containment vs. Going_In/Out, and they are learned from all sensorimodalities. 

Evidence for image schemas is drawn from a number of related disciplines, including work on cross-modal cognition in psychology, from spatial cognition in both linguistics and psychology, cognitive linguistics, and from neuroscience. The influences of image schemas is not only seen in cognitive linguistics and developmental psychology, but also in interface design and more recently, the theory has become of increased interest in artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics to help ground meaning.

==Johnson: From image schemas to abstract reasoning via metaphor==
Image schemas are dynamic embodied patterns—they take place &quot;in&quot; and &quot;through&quot; time. Moreover, they are multi-modal patterns of experience, not simply visual. For instance, consider how the dynamic nature of the containment schema is reflected in the various spatial senses of the English word &quot;out&quot;. &quot;Out&quot; may be used in cases where a clearly defined trajector (TR) leaves a spatially bounded landmark (LM), as in:
:(1a) John went out of the room.
:(1b) Mary got out of the car.
:(1c) Spot jumped out of the pen.

In the most prototypical of such cases the landmark is a clearly defined container. However, &quot;out&quot; may also be used to indicate those cases where the trajector is a mass that spreads out, effectively expanding the area of the containing landmark:
:(2a) She poured out the beans.
:(2b) Roll out the carpet.
:(2c) Send out the troops.

Finally, &quot;out&quot; is also often used to describe motion along a linear path where the containing landmark is implied and not defined at all:
:(3) The train started out for Chicago.

Experientially basic and primarily spatial image schemas such as the Containment schema and its derivatives the Out schemas lend their logic to non-spatial situations. For example, one may metaphorically use the term &quot;out&quot; to describe non-spatial experiences:
:(4) Leave out that big log when you stack the firewood. (Schema used directly and non-metaphorically.)
:(4a) I don&#x27;t want to leave any relevant data out of my argument. (Schema metaphorically projected onto argumentation.)
:(4b) Tell me your story again, and don&#x27;t leave out any details. (Schema metaphorically projected onto story-telling.)
:(4c) She finally came out of her depression. (Schema metaphorically projected onto emotional life.)

Johnson argues that more abstract reasoning is shaped by such underlying spatial patterns. For example, he notes that the logic of containment is not just a matter of being in or out of the container. For example, if someone is in a &quot;deep&quot; depression, we know it is likely to be a long time before they are well. The deeper the trajector is in the container, the longer it will take for the trajector to get out of it. Similarly, Johnson argues that transitivity and the law of the excluded middle in logic are underlaid by preconceptual embodied experiences of the Containment schema.

==Lakoff: Image schemas in Brugman&#x27;s &quot;The story of Over&quot;==
In case study two of his book &quot;Women, Fire and Dangerous Things&quot;, Lakoff re-presented the analysis of the English word &quot;over&quot; done by Claudia Brugman in her (1981) master&#x27;s thesis. Similar to the analysis of &quot;out&quot; given by Johnson, Lakoff argued that there were six basic spatial schemas for the English word &quot;over&quot;. Moreover, Lakoff gave a detailed accounting of how these schemas were interrelated in terms of what he called a &quot;radial category structure&quot;. For example, these six schemas could be both further specified by other spatial schemas such as whether the trajector was in contact with the landmark or not (as in &quot;the plane flew over the mountain&quot; vs. &quot;he climbed over the mountain&quot;). Furthermore, Lakoff identified a group of &quot;transformational&quot; image schemata such as rotational schemas and path to object mass, as in &quot;Spider-Man climbed all over the wall&quot;. This analysis raised profound questions about how image schemas could be grouped, transformed, and how sequences of image schemas could be chained together in language, mind, and brain.

==Relationships to similar theories==
Johnson indicates that his analysis of &quot;out&quot; drew upon a 1981 doctoral dissertation by Susan Lindner in linguistics at UCSD under Ronald Langacker, and more generally by the theory of cognitive grammar put forth by him. For the force group of image schemas Johnson also drew on an early version of the force dynamic schemas put forth by Len Talmy, as used by linguists such as Eve Sweetser. Other influences include Max Wertheimer&#x27;s gestalt structure theory and Kant&#x27;s account of schemas in categorization, as well as studies in experimental psychology on the mental rotation of images.

In addition to the dissertation on &quot;over&quot; by Brugman, Lakoff&#x27;s use of image schema theory also drew extensively on Talmy and Langacker&#x27;s theories of spatial relations terms. Other theories making use of similar conceptual primitives to capture meaning include Jean M. Mandler&#x27;s &quot;spatial primitives&quot;, Anna Wierzbicka&#x27;s &quot;semantic primes&quot;&quot;, Leonard Talmy&#x27;s conceptual primitives,&quot; Roger Schank &quot;conceptual dependency theory&quot; and Andrea A. diSessa&#x27;s phenomenological primitives (p-prims).

Image schemas have also been proposed to be descriptors of Gibsonian affordances. An object like a &quot;cup&quot; affords the image schema Containment to liquids and an abstract concept like &quot;transportation&quot; offer the affordance of moving something from one point to another as an image-schematic combination of Source-Path-Goal and Containment (alternatively Support).

== Formal specification of image schemas and role in artificial intelligence ==

While originally a theory for cognitive linguistics, the theory of image schemas and the underlying ideas behind embodied cognition have become of increased interest in artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics to help solve issues with natural language comprehension and the application of affordances. The research on formal accounts (e.g.) of these abstract patterns date back several decades and has been proposed as a way to deal with geographical information science , natural language comprehension, automatic ontology generation and computational conceptual blending.

As a direct relation to embodied cognition, and more specifically embodied construction grammar, formal approaches to image schemas often limit the research area by looking at image schemas exclusively as &quot;spatiotemporal relationships&quot;. This provides a feasible foundation for knowledge representation to represent each individual image schema as well as their interconnection as relationships in a 3D space. One formal language to describe them is the ISL (Image Schema Language), a logic language combined by different formal calculi and first-order logic that builds on creating hierarchical families of logical micro-theories that is able to represent different degrees of specification of the image schemas. 

In artificial intelligence, image schemas are also used as an inspiration to advance natural language comprehension of metaphors, conceptual blending and creative language use. This is extended to also include non-linguistic reasoning such as commonsense reasoning (e.g. see Davis&#x27; Egg cracking problem and the approach made to describe it image-schematically) and the formal structure of events prototypical as some of the biggest challenges in AI.

==Lists of image schemas==
While Johnson provided an initial list of image schemas in &quot;The Body in the Mind&quot; (p. 126), his diagrams for them are scattered throughout his book and he only diagrammed a portion of those image schemas he listed. In his work, Lakoff also used several additional schemas.

<text>The Hunter Region, also commonly known as the Hunter Valley, Newcastle Region, or simply Hunter, is a region in northern New South Wales, Australia, extending from approximately to north of Sydney. It contains the Hunter River and its tributaries with highland areas to the north and south. Situated at the northern end of the Sydney Basin bioregion, the Hunter Valley is one of the largest river valleys on the NSW coast, and is most commonly known for its wineries and coal industry.

Most of the population of the Hunter Region lives within of the coast, with 55% of the entire population living in the cities of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie. There are numerous other towns and villages scattered across the region in the eleven local government areas (LGAs) that make up the region. At the the combined population of the region was 682,465, and is expected to reach over 1,000,000 people by 2031. Under Australia&#x27;s wine appellation system, the Hunter Valley wine zone Australian Geographical Indication (GI) covers the entire catchment of the Hunter River and its tributaries. Within that, the Hunter region is almost as large, and includes most of the wine-producing areas, excluding the metropolitan area of Newcastle and nearby coastal areas, some national parks, and any land that was in the Mudgee Shire (at the western heights of the catchment).

The Hunter wine region is one of Australia&#x27;s best known wine regions, playing a pivotal role in the history of Australian wine as one of the first wine regions planted in the early 19th century. The success of the Hunter Valley wine industry has been dominated by its proximity to Sydney with its settlement and plantings in the 19th century fuelled by the trade network that linked the Hunter Valley to Sydney. The steady demand of consumers from Sydney continues to drive much of the Hunter Valley wine industry, including a factor in the economy by the tourism industry. While the Hunter Valley has been supplanted by the massive Riverina wine region as the largest producer of New South Wales wine, it still accounts for around 3% of Australia&#x27;s total wine production and is one of the country&#x27;s most recognisable regions.

== History ==
For over 30,000 years the Wonnarua people of Aboriginal Australians inhabited the land that is now known as the Hunter Valley wine region. Along with the Worimi to the north and the Awabakal to the south, the Wonnarua developed a trading route connecting the Coquun (Hunter) Valley to the harbour now known as Sydney harbour.

The wine-making history of Hunter Valley begins with the European settlement of the Sydney and the New South Wales region of Australia in the late 18th century as a penal colony of the British Empire. The Hunter River itself was discovered, by accident, in 1797 by British Lieutenant John Shortland as he searched for escaped convicts. The region soon became a valuable source for timber and coal that fuelled the steamship trade coming out of Sydney.

Land prospector John Howe cut a path through the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the (Lower) Hunter Valley proper in 1820. Today, the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and Singleton follows Howe&#x27;s exact path and is a major thoroughfare for wine tourists coming into the Hunter Valley from Sydney. As previous plantings in the coastal areas around Sydney succumbed to the humidity and wetness, and plantings to the west were limited by spring frost damage, northern reaches leading to the Hunter became, almost by default, the wine region of the new colony.

The expansive growth of the Hunter Valley wine industry in the mid to late 19th century arose from its monopoly position in the lucrative Sydney market. The provincial government of New South Wales had enacted regulations that placed prohibitive duties on wines from other areas such as Victoria and South Australia. Following World War I, many returning Australian veterans were given land grants in the Hunter Valley. This temporarily produced an up-tick in plantings but the global Great Depression as well as a series of devastating hail storms between 1929 and 1930 caused many growers to abandon their vineyards.
== Geography ==

===Geology===
The Hunter Region is considered a transitional area between the Paleozoic rock foundation of the New England Fold Belt located to the south and the Early Permian and Middle Triassic period rock formations of the Sydney Basin to the south. Between these two geological areas is the Hunter-Mooki Thrust fault. At one time this fault was very geologically active and gave rise to the Brokenback range that feature prominently in the Hunter region. Strips of basalt found throughout the region also bear witness to the volcanic activity that has occurred in the history of this fault.

The Permian rocks in the central and southeastern expanse of the Lower Hunter Valley were formed when the area was underneath a shallow marine estuary. The remnants of this period has left an extensive network of coal seams that fuelled the early population boom of the Hunter Valley in the 19th century as well a high degree of salinity in the water table of much of the area. The further north and west, towards the Brokenback Range and the Upper Hunter, the more Triassic sandstone that can be found leading eventually to the carboniferous rocks that form the northern boundary of the Hunter with the New England Fold Belt and the foothills of the Barrington Tops.

Overall, the Hunter Valley has more soils (mostly hard, acidic patches of poorly draining heavy clay) that are unsuitable for viticulture than they have areas that are ideal for growing grapes. The soils of the Lower Hunter vary widely from sandy alluvial flats (often planted to Semillon), to deep friable loam (often planted with Shiraz) and friable red duplex soils. In the Upper Hunter, the rivers and creeks of the region contribute to the areas black, silty loam soils that are often overlaid on top of alkaline clay loam. Among the hills of the Brokenback range are strips of volcanic basalt that are prized by growers for their tendencies to restrict vigor and concentrate mineral flavours in the grapes. The Warkworth Sands Woodland of the Hunter Valley are situated on these soils.

=== Rivers ===
The main river in the region is the Hunter River, after which the region is named. Other rivers in the region include the Allyn, Avon, Barrington, Bow, Bowman, Chichester, Gloucester, Goulburn, Isis, Karuah, Krui, Mammy Johnsons, Merriwa, Munmurra, Pages, Paterson, Wangat and Williams rivers.

Despite being the area&#x27;s namesake, the Hunter River itself is not the dominant feature of the region—falling behind the Brokenback Range for that distinction. The greater river system of the Hunter, which includes the Goulburn and important tributaries such as Giants Creek, do provide needed irrigation for areas such as the Upper Hunter than can be prone to drought condition. The origins of the river begin the Liverpool Range of the volcanic Barrington Tops and flows south and then east down to the Pacific Ocean at the seaport city of Newcastle.

=== Water supply ===
Fresh water supply for the region is provided from a number of sources, which are managed by the Hunter Water and State Water Corporations. State Water Corporation&#x27;s dams supply water for irrigation, industrial use at coal mines and the region&#x27;s coal-fired power stations, and town water to upper Hunter Region towns. Hunter Water Corporation&#x27;s dams supply the large urban population of more than 500,000 living near the coast and centred on the cities of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie.

State Water Corporation&#x27;s Glenbawn, the largest dam in the region, Chichester and Lostock are dams on the Hunter, Chichester and Paterson rivers respectively. Hunter Water Corporation&#x27;s Grahamstown Dam, the largest dam supplying the urban areas of the lower Hunter Region, is supplied with water diverted from the Williams River just north of the Seaham Weir, through a large pump station at Balickera. The dam itself has only a small natural catchment and relies mainly on the pumped water from the Williams River. A proposal to build Tillegra Dam on the Williams River existed since the 1950s, but was scrapped in 2010. In addition to the dams, fresh water for the lower Hunter Region is supplied from the Tomago Sandbeds, via a series of bores.

=== Towns and cities ===
The Hunter Region includes four cities. In order of population these are Lake Macquarie, Newcastle, Maitland and Cessnock. Other major centres of the Hunter Region are Dungog, Gloucester, Kurri Kurri, Muswellbrook, Raymond Terrace, Scone and Singleton.

==Climate==
The climate of Hunter Valley is humid subtropical, similar to the Greater Western Sydney region, with distinctive maritime influences from the Pacific Ocean. With its northerly latitude and close oceanic influences, the Hunter Valley is one of Australia&#x27;s hottest and wettest wine regions. Flanked by mountains to the west and north the Hunter Valley acts as a funnel, pulling cool ocean breezes into the area. With those cooling breezes also comes heavy rainfall and periodic cyclonic storms in the summer and autumn months.

In the summer, the average daily temperature regularly exceeds while during the winter the temperature averages around . Temperatures during January average between , with the temperature becoming progressively hotter the further inland you move away from the cooling influence of the sea. During the spring the Hunter Valley receives an average of 7.3–7.5 hours of sunshine a day.

Mid-latitude westerly winds bring high pressure weather front that alternate with cold fronts on the winter. This leads to generally drier conditions in the winter months of July and August. In the summer, southeasterly winds bring weather fronts harbouring extensive amounts of moisture. Between October and April more than two thirds of the region&#x27;s annual rainfall will fall with January and February being the wettest months. Between the months of October–April, the 3pm average for relative humidity in the Lower Hunter is 49%, while it is 43% in the Upper Hunter.

== Industries ==
The main industries in the Hunter Region are coal mining, manufacturing, agriculture, viticulture and wine making, tourism, horse breeding, electricity production, dairy farming and beef cattle farming, and associated service industries. The Hunter Region is one of Australia&#x27;s most famous wine-growing regions, known for both its red and white wine varieties.

=== Coal mining ===

The most important economic activity in the valley is coal mining (through businesses such as Rio Tinto and BHP), mostly for export. The Port of Newcastle is the world&#x27;s largest export facility for coal, most of which is brought to the port by rail. Coal ships are often seen off the coast of Newcastle.

=== Electricity generation ===
Electricity generation at the Eraring, Bayswater, Liddell, Munmorah, Redbank and Vales Point coal-fired power stations is a major industry of the region.

=== Horse breeding ===
The Hunter Valley is Australia&#x27;s main region for the breeding and rearing of Thoroughbred horses and most of the country&#x27;s best racehorses. The Upper Hunter area around Scone is one of the largest horse breeding areas in the world.

=== Tourism ===
Commonly known as &quot;Wine Country&quot;, the Hunter Valley is a major tourist destination in New South Wales and is the 6th most visited place in Australia attracting more than 2.5 million people annually. There are regular events held in the Hunter for visitors, including the Hunter Valley Steam Trains running the first three Sundays of each month and regular scenic cruises on the Hunter River and Lake Macquarie.

=== Wine production ===


The Hunter Valley Wine Zone Australian Geographical Indication was registered on 1 May 1996 and is approximately the entire Hunter River catchment. It contains only one named wine region, Hunter. The Hunter Wine Region Australian Geographical Indication was declared on 18 March 1997. It is not as large as the Hunter Valley zone, but includes most of the significant vineyards. It does not extend east of the Pacific Highway.

Some of the oldest vines in the Hunter Valley were planted in 1924 around the village of Fordwich. Pokolbin, located in the &quot;Lower Hunter Valley&quot;, is the centre of the Hunter Valley wine country, which claims to be Australia&#x27;s oldest wine region. It is located between the towns of Cessnock and Branxton, about west of Newcastle. The wine country is primarily located within the Cessnock and Singleton LGAs. Its proximity to Sydney has been an influence on the area&#x27;s investments in wine production and its emergence as a tourist destination. The Broke Fordwich area is located along the Hunter River tributary of the Wollombi Brook near the suburb of Pokolbin and was founded in 1830 by Major Thomas Mitchell who named the region after his fellow Napoleonic War veteran Sir Charles Broke-Vere.

Much of the rolling countryside around Pokolbin is under vine and has a large number of vineyards, restaurants, shops, golf courses and country guesthouses. Other parts of the valley including the Wollombi Valley and Broke Fordwich subregion are also well known for wine, along with the Upper Hunter Valley. The main town in the Upper Hunter Valley subregion is Muswellbrook.

== Administration ==
=== Political representation ===
For the purposes of Australian federal elections for the House of Representatives, the Hunter Region is contained within the divisions of Hunter, Lyne, Newcastle, Paterson, and Shortland.

For the purposes of New South Wales elections for the Legislative Assembly, the Hunter Region is contained within the electoral districts of Cessnock, Charlestown, Lake Macquarie, Maitland, Myall Lakes, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Swansea, Upper Hunter, Wallsend, and Wyong.

=== Demography and area ===
The following local government areas are contained within the region:

=== Environmental protection ===
The Hunter Region contains the Goulburn River National Park, Myall Lakes National Park, Barrington Tops National Park, Werakata National Park, Watagans National Park, Mount Royal National Park, Polkolbin State Forest, Putty State Forest, Chichester State Forest, Running Creek Nature Reserve, The Glen Nature Reserve, Black Bulga State Conservation Area, Myall River State Forest, and Karuah Nature Reserve.

Within the Hunter, many endangered ecological communities (EECs) have been declared under the TSC Act. These communities are found on both public and private land, and prior to development of land, the landowner is required to undertake an environmental assessment to ascertain whether it will impact endangered species or endangered communities. Examples of endangered ecological communities found within the Hunter Region are:
# Grey Box–Grey Gum Wet Sclerophyll Forest
# Hunter Floodplain Red Gum Woodland
# Hunter Lowland Redgum Forest
# Hunter Valley Vine Thicket
# Hunter Valley Weeping Myall Woodland
# Lower Hunter Valley Dry Rainforest
# Warkworth Sands Woodland. This EEC occurs on aeolian sands, south east of Singleton (but may occur elsewhere in the Bioregion.)

== Statehood movement ==
There is an active movement campaigning for the Hunter Region to secede from New South Wales to form its own state. The sale of the Port of Newcastle and the refusal of the NSW state government to build a container terminal in Newcastle has been cited as the motivation behind the campaign. The movement&#x27;s demands include a Royal commission into the feasibility of Hunter Valley Statehood as soon as possible, and a referendum on Hunter Valley statehood by 2030.

Chapter VI of the Constitution of Australia allows new states to be formed, but only with the consent of the Parliament of the state in question.

<text>The Royal Yachting Association (RYA) is a United Kingdom national governing body for sailing, dinghy sailing, yacht and motor cruising, sail racing, RIBs and sportsboats, windsurfing and personal watercraft and a leading representative for inland waterways cruising.

==History==
The &quot;Yacht Racing Association&quot; was founded in November 1875. Its initial purpose was to standardize the rules of measurement to different racing yachts so that boats of different classes could compete fairly against each other. Membership at the time cost two guineas and was available to &quot;former and present owners of racing yachts of and above 10 tons Thames measurement and such other gentlemen as the committee may elect&quot;.

In 1921 the YRA incorporated the independent Sailing Boat Association and the Boat Racing Association into its body. In 1952 the YRA became the Royal Yachting Association (RYA).

The RYA remains constituted as a membership association, with a Council of elected volunteers as its supreme policy-making body. It publishes over 110 maritime titles that are regarded internationally and is translated into more than 20 foreign languages. RYA Magazine is the organisation&#x27;s membership magazine.

==British Sailing Team==
The RYA manages the British Sailing Team (BST), from which Team GB&#x27;s Olympic sailing team is selected. Training and infrastructure is provided by the RYA, while central funding is through bodies such as The National Lottery. The British Sailing team is the most successful Olympic sailing team in the world, and sailing is the only sport in which Great Britain leads the on the Olympic medal table.

==Committees==
While the RYA Council is the RYA&#x27;s senior policy-making body in boating matters, responsibility for the Association&#x27;s different activities and areas of interest is delegated to a number of policy committees.

The main function of the policy committees and sub-committees is to agree and oversee the implementation of RYA policy in their respective areas. Responsibility for day-to-day management of each area rests with the RYA&#x27;s professional staff, with the relevant departmental manager acting as secretary to his or her committee.

== Powerboat Racing ==

The RYA announced in August 2018 that they would no longer act as the national authority for powerboat racing in the United Kingdom.

‘Financial, safety, and reputational challenge&#x27;s were the reasons given for the decision alongside the fact that the Powerboat Racing office had only issued 92 adult and 18 junior licences in 2018.

<text>The small arms trade (also called small arms proliferation and the small arms market) is the markets of both authorized and illicit small arms and light weapons (SALW), as well as their parts, accessories, and ammunition.

== Definition ==
The arms trade, or small arms market, includes both authorized transfers of small arms and light weapons (and their parts, accessories, and bullets) and illicit transfers of such weapons. Small arms and light arms are those that can be transported by one or two people, or carried by pack animal or vehicles, ranging from firearms like pistols and light machine guns to man-portable air-defense systems (MPADS), mortars, and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). The trade occurs globally, but is concentrated in areas of armed conflict, violence, and organized crime. In terms of actions that are illicit, this trade involves the illegal trafficking of small arms and the exchange of money and drugs for small arms, which are all commodities that cross borders around the globe. These weapons are not only the choice for a majority of regional conflicts today, but also for many terrorist groups operating around the world. Legal transfers are generally defined as those approved by the involved governments and in accordance with national and international law. Black market (illegal) transfers violate either national or international law and take place without official government authorization. Gray market transfers are those of unclear legality that do not belong in either of the other categories.

In 2003, various international organizations (including Amnesty International, Oxfam International, IANSA), and domestic groups (e.g. the Small Arms Working Group in the U.S.) committed themselves to limiting the trade in and proliferation of small arms around the world. They said that roughly 500,000 people are killed each year by the use of small arms.

== Scope ==

=== Main small arms exporters ===
The Small Arms Survey, an independent research project based in Switzerland, said in its 2003 report that at least 1,134 companies in 98 countries worldwide are involved in some aspect of the production of small arms and ammunition. The largest exporters of small arms by value are the European Union and the United States.

In 2010, the number of countries exporting at least $100 million of small arms annually rose from 12 to 14. The exporters&#x27; list was led by the U.S., followed by Italy, Germany, Brazil, Austria, Switzerland, Israel, Russia, South Korea, Belgium, China, Turkey, Spain and the Czech Republic. Sweden dropped off the list because its exports fell from $132 million in 2010 to $44 million in 2011.

In addition, massive exports of small arms by the U.S. (M16), the former Soviet Union (AKM), People&#x27;s Republic of China (Type 56), Germany (H&amp;K G3), Belgium (FN FAL), and Brazil (FN FAL) during the Cold War took place commercially and to support ideological movements. These small arms have survived many conflicts and many are now in the hands of arms dealers or smaller governments who move them between conflict areas as needed.

=== Main small arms importers ===
The eight countries that imported at least $100 million of small arms in 2011 were the United States, Canada, Germany, Australia, Thailand, United Kingdom, France and Italy. South Korea dropped from the list because its imports fell from $130 million in 2010 to $40 million in 2011.

==United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms==
The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects was held in New York City from 9–20 July 2001 as decided in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 54/54 V. Preceded by three preparatory committee sessions, the two-week Conference resulted in the adoption of the &#x27;Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.&#x27; States are required to report to the United Nations on the progress of their implementation of the UN Programme of Action, commonly known as the PoA.

The extent to which illicit trade in small arms is a primary cause of armed conflict and other serious humanitarian and socioeconomic issues has drawn controversy. The extremely high incidence of small arms violence and the presence of illicitly obtained weapons, especially in areas of turmoil and armed conflict, is undisputed. Because other societal factors play a strong role in creating armed conflict, however, the role of such weapons as a driver of continued violence and disruption has been called into question. Recent scholarship has focused on the root societal causes for violence in addition to the enabling tools. Another target of criticism is the ability to regulate illicit trafficking through international means, since it is unclear exactly what proportion of the weapons are trafficked across borders. The nature of the trafficking enterprise makes exact statistics difficult to determine. Recently, however, researchers have had some success establishing hard numbers within limited parameters.

According to a 2012 Routledge Studies in Peace and Conflict Resolution publication, &quot;the relative importance of diversion or misuse of officially authorised transfers, compared to international entirely illegal black market trafficking has been thoroughly confirmed.&quot; The authors go on to elaborate that...&quot;For most developing or fragile states, a combination of weak domestic regulation of authorised firearms possession with theft, loss or corrupt sale from official holdings tends to be a bigger source of weapons concern than illicit trafficking across borders.&quot;

The United Nations General Assembly scheduled a review conference in New York which was held from 26 June to 7 July 2006. The Review Conference was plagued by disagreements and states were unable to agree on a substantive outcome document. There have also been four Biennial Meetings of States to consider the implementation of the Programme of Action, in 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2010. The 2008 Biennial Meeting of States resulted in the adoption, by vote, of an Outcome Document focusing on three main issues: international assistance, cooperation and capacity-building; stockpile management and surplus disposal; and illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons. The Fourth Biennial Meeting in 2010 was able to adopt, for the first time by consensus, a substantive Outcome Document which addresses the issue of illicit trade across borders.

A second conference convened from 27 August to 7 September 2012 in New York.

== Data issues ==
Perhaps the greatest barrier to resolving debates over gun policy is the lack of comprehensive data. Although the UN Arms Register tries to keep track of major weapons holdings, there is no global reporting system for small arms. Gathering data for Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) can be difficult, considering the transparency of some countries and lack of an organized system within countries. However, as pointed out by the Small Arms Survey, in the past ten years twenty-nine countries have made available a national arms export report. Twenty-five of these countries being European, while only four countries being non-European which include Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United States. While some countries make information available about the small arms of their armed forces and law enforcement agencies; others release estimated data on public ownership. Most refuse to release anything, release rough estimates or simply do not know. Fortunately, to address these issues, the Small Arms Survey&#x27;s contributors have devised a transparency barometer allowing them to consider each country&#x27;s cooperation and credibility on shared information.

According to the 2007 edition of the &quot;Small Arms Survey&quot;, there are at least 639 million firearms in the world, although the actual total is almost certainly considerably higher. This number increases by approximately 8 million every year, for a total economic impact of about US$7 billion annually.

The &quot;Small Arms Survey&quot; figures are estimates, based on available national figures and field research in particular countries. They give a general sense of trends and the scale of the number of small arms.

== Gun rights issues ==
There is tremendous variability in the adoption of gun control with respect to individual civilian ownership, and international arms control, in different regions across the globe. The right to bear arms is a right guaranteed under the Constitution of the United States and gun ownership for purposes other than hunting is prevalent and socially acceptable. Non-governmental organisations such as IANSA argue that the prevalence of small arms contributes to the cycle of violence between governments and individuals. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled (most notably in Antonin Scalia&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;) that due to the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, the legislative and executive branches of both the federal and state governments are limited in their abilities to regulate gun ownership.

U.S. gun rights lobby groups, most notably the National Rifle Association of America and Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, assert that access to gun ownership is often necessary for self-defence, including defence against government intrusion into private citizen&#x27;s lives. The JPFO asserts that confiscation of private firearms is a necessary but not sufficient condition for tyranny, and draws parallels between contemporary efforts to register and confiscate guns and the actions of the National Socialist German Workers Party during the lead up to the Second World War (see: Nazi gun control argument). Similarly, gun ownership is widely held by many in Pakistan to be a necessary protection against crime as well as a way through which citizens can participate in law enforcement.

Stephen Halbrook, a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute and an author and lawyer known for his litigation on behalf of the National Rifle Association, proposed that disarming citizens leaves them defenseless against totalitarian governments (such as Jews in Nazi Germany).

==Impact on Africa==
The persistence and the complication of wars in Africa is sometimes blamed on small arms proliferation. A comparison between the murder rates in pre- and post-colonial would help determine the impact of small arms proliferation. Africa Researchers for the Small Arms Survey estimate that approximately 30 million firearms are being circulated throughout Africa. This number is much less than the total number of small arms in Europe, estimated to be 84 million. However, the number of small arms isn&#x27;t as important in comparison to how they are being used. The Small Arms Survey reports that at least 38 different companies are producing small arms in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet indigenous companies are not fulfilling the demands. South Africa is the largest exporter of small arms in the region, but only $6 million in small arms were exported out of the country, while $25 million in small arms were imported into the continent in 2005. Beyond legal trade, the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons also has a great effect on Africa. Many of the illicit trade among small arms in Africa can be attributed to post-conflict removal and movement of weapons. This illegal transfer of weapons from country-to-country has been seen to incite conflict in bordering regions by the same armed groups. An example of this can be seen in the conflicts ranging from Liberia, moving towards Sierra-Leone, the Ivory Coast, and finally to Guinea. Another illicit trade of small arms is seen in craft production. Reports from arms analysts Matt Schroeder and Guy Lamb suggest that the country Ghana has the potential to yield 200,000 new weapons every year.

The consequences of small arms on African people due to international conflicts within Africa, rebel group activities, mercenary groups, and armed gang activities have yet to be fully measured, although Stockholm Peace Research Institute means transparency and information-sharing regarding arms transfers in the region will build trust and confidence. The International Action Network on Small Arms, Saferworld, and Oxfam International put it in perspective when they reported that armed conflict cost Africa $18 billion each year and about US$300 billion between 1990 and 2005. During this period, 23 African nations experienced war: Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Central Africa Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Republic of Congo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda.

<text>James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Patrick Zappalorti (September 29, 1945 – January 22, 1990), a disabled veteran of the Vietnam War, was the victim of a highly publicized, fatal gay-bashing attack on Staten Island, New York. The murder led to increased efforts to pass a statewide hate crime law, which was ultimately enacted in 2000.

== Biography ==
Born in Brooklyn, Zappalorti moved to Staten Island in 1950, his family settling in the Charleston neighborhood. The family ran a stained-glass business whose clients included approximately 30 churches on the island and others as far away as the West Coast and Canada.

After attending Our Lady Help of Christians School in Tottenville, Zappalorti attended Tottenville High School, but dropped out before graduating in order to enlist in the United States Navy on November 27, 1962. His mother signed the parental consent form (necessary because he was not yet 18 years old), after his father refused to do so.

Zappalorti served as a seaman aboard the USS &quot;Henrico&quot;, which saw action in the Vietnam War. He was placed on disabled status and honorably discharged on April 5, 1965, after a nervous breakdown from a traumatic incident in which he was assaulted by some shipmates and his partner was killed.

== Murder ==
Upon his return to Staten Island, Zappalorti did not hold down a formal job but was frequently seen in the neighborhood planting trees and clearing away debris. His life came to an abrupt end on the evening of January 22, 1990, after Zappalorti bought beer and invited a neighborhood resident and his companion to a small hut he had built on the beach beyond the woods across the street from his family&#x27;s home. Once there, the duo demanded Zappalorti&#x27;s wallet. After he tossed it away, the neighbor, Michael Taylor, 20 years old, pulled out a hunting knife and stabbed him three times in the chest and abdomen, causing his death. The duo then attempted to rob Zappalorti&#x27;s house using his keys, but were discovered by his mother. Zappalorti&#x27;s brother, Michael Zappalorti Jr., discovered the body the following day. A subsequent autopsy showed four stab wounds, and authorities speculate that the fourth wound was inflicted by Taylor&#x27;s accomplice, identified as 26-year-old Phillip Sarlo.

Taylor was taken into custody at 2:30 A.M. on January 24 as he stepped outside a bar in the South Beach section of Staten Island, but Sarlo fled the area and was not apprehended until February 18, after he was found in Ocala, Florida. Gay rights activists asked New York State Governor Mario Cuomo to appoint a special prosecutor to the case, citing the fact that Staten Island District Attorney William L. Murphy had been the only one of the city&#x27;s five district attorneys to oppose the city&#x27;s anti-gay-discrimination law when it was passed in 1986. Also, in that same year, Murphy had prosecuted a carjacking case that resulted in Taylor, then 16 years old, being adjudicated a juvenile offender when he could have been tried as an adult, and Sarlo receiving a sentence of 1½ to 4½ years, the minimum then possible on the charges for which he had been indicted.

In both the 1986 carjacking case and the Zappalorti murder, Taylor, in statements he made to the police, cited animosity toward homosexuals as a motive for the crime. (The victim in the 1986 case was attacked near a boardwalk in the South Beach area reportedly frequented by homosexuals, and Zappalorti&#x27;s sexual orientation was common knowledge in the neighborhood where both he and Taylor resided.) Sarlo, however, denied harboring such sentiments.

== Verdict ==
The Zappalorti case never went to trial, because on December 5, 1990, after extensive &quot;plea-bargaining&quot; negotiations, both Taylor and Sarlo plead guilty to charges of second-degree murder. (In New York State at the time, first-degree murder applied only if the victim was a law-enforcement officer or the killer was already serving a life sentence for a previous murder.) It is reported that the district attorney&#x27;s office was reluctant to go to trial because of fears the defendants might have attempted to use the gay panic defense, and may have garnered considerable sympathy from a potential jury in culturally conservative, heavily Roman Catholic Staten Island.

Pursuant to the plea agreement, Taylor received a prison sentence of 23 years to life while Sarlo was sentenced to 18 years to life. On May 30, 1997, Sarlo killed himself at the maximum-security Wende Correctional Facility outside Buffalo. Taylor was also incarcerated at a maximum-security institution, and was denied parole in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020.

== Aftermath ==
The 1990 killing of James Zappalorti was recognized as the first anti-gay hate crime in New York City since police began categorizing such crimes in 1980. One of Zappalorti&#x27;s nephews was hospitalized for his own gay-bashing in 1993 at age 22, in nearby Rossville, Staten Island. The murder and subsequent attacks led to increased efforts to pass a statewide hate crime law, which was supported by Mayor David Dinkins and John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor and ultimately enacted in 2000. On May 29, 2015, a street in Charleston, Staten Island, was renamed in honor of Zappalorti.

<doc id="506030" wikidata="Q843138" url="?curid=506030" title="Bhaktapur">
<text>Bhaktapur (Nepali and Sanskrit: भक्तपुर, ; &quot;City of Devotees&quot;), known locally as Khwopa (Nepal Bhasa: , ) and historically called Bhadgaon, is a city in the east corner of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal located about from the capital city, Kathmandu. Bhaktapur is the smallest city of Nepal as well as the most densely populated. Along with Kathmandu and Lalitpur, Bhaktapur is one of the three main cities of the Kathmandu Valley and is a major Newar settlement of the country. The city is also known for its Newar tradition, cuisine and artisans. Bhaktapur suffered heavy damage in the April 2015 earthquake.

As part of the Kathmandu Valley, it shares its history, culture and language with the other cities of the valley. Although chronicles like the Gopal Raj Vamshavali put the foundation of Bhaktapur in the 12th century, it has been the site of numerous settlements since at least the Licchavi dynasty. The capital place of Kasthamandu was Bhaktapur Nepal during the first half of Malla dynasty from the 12th century to 1482 when Nepal split into three independent kingdoms. The Malla dynasty is considered a golden period for Bhaktapur and even after its division in 1428, Bhaktapur managed to stay as a wealthy and a powerful Newar kingdom, mostly due to its position in the ancient India-Tibet trade route. In 1769, Bhaktapur was attacked and annexed into the expanding Gorkha Kingdom (which later became the Kingdom of Nepal). After its annexation, Bhaktapur remained largely isolated from other parts of Nepal which led to stagnation in the development of its economy and arts and to allowed it to remain as a homogeneous Newar city. Due to being isolated and overlooked by the central government in Kathmandu, its infrastructure and economy deteriorated and the 1934 earthquake further exacerbated the situation. Bhaktapur&#x27;s economy and infrastructure would only improve from the 1980s, largely due to tourism and aid provided by West Germany as part of the Bhaktapur Development Project.

Compared to other Newar settlements, Bhaktapur is predominantly Hindu and speaks a distinct dialect of Nepal Bhasa. Bhaktapur is one of the most visited tourist destination of Nepal with the city attracting 301,012 tourists in 2014. The Nyatapola, a five roofed pagoda completed in 1702 is the most famous structure of Bhaktapur and along with the former royal palace, it forms the tourism center of Bhaktapur. The city is also famous for its numerous festivals and carnivals like the spring festival of Biskā jātrā and the carnival of Sāpāru (or Gai jatra) both of which are significant part of the local culture and contribute well to tourism. Bhaktapur is also called the &quot;Capital of Music and Dance&quot; () in Nepal due to presence of over 200 types of traditional dances, most of which are masked dances and expect for a few, are a part of the annual carnival of Sāpāru (or Gai jatra). It is also famous for its cuisine with the &quot;jūjū dhau,&quot; a type of yogurt made from buffalo milk being the most popular. Bhaktapur&#x27;s potters and handicraft industries are also known nationwide. Due to its well preserved medieval nature, UNESCO inscribed Bhaktapur as a World Heritage Site since 1979.

== Etymology ==
The earliest use of the name &quot;Bhaktapur&quot; is from an inscription from 928. It is widely accepted that the name is a Sanskrit translation of the city&#x27;s name in the native language, an early form of the Newar language, &quot;Khōpring&quot;. The earliest use of this name is from a Licchavi dynasty inscription from 594. The name &quot;Khōpring&quot; is a combination of two words from an early form of the Newar language, &quot;&quot;kho&quot; and &quot;pring&quot;&quot; which translate to &quot;cooked rice&quot; and &quot;village,&quot; respectively. The city was also sometimes referred as &quot;Bhaktagrāma&quot; instead of &quot;Bhaktapura&quot; where &quot;grāma&quot; denoted a village as opposed to &quot;pura&quot; which denoted a town in Sanskrit.

From &quot;Khopring&quot; also evolved, &quot;Khwopa&quot; , the name of the city in the classical and modern form of the native Newar language. &quot;Khwopa&quot; as the name for the city, appeared for the first time in a manuscript from 1004. The term &quot;Khwopa&quot; was used to describe the city in almost all of the inscriptions, manuscripts and documents from the Malla dynasty.

Another popular name for the city was &quot;Bhatgaon&quot;, the Hindustani and Khas translation of &quot;Bhaktagrama&quot;. This name became particularly popular after the conquest of Bhaktapur by the Gorkhali armies of Prithivi Narayan Shah in 1769. It is believed that the official name was changed back to Bhaktapur in the 1930s by the decree of the Prime Minister Juddha Shumsher Rana, after witnessing the numerous temples in the city and the devotion of the locals towards it, decreed that the city should be referred as &quot;Bhaktapur&quot; as in &quot;City of devotees&quot; instead of &quot;Bhatgaon&quot;.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
The folklore of the Kathmandu Valley states that the entire valley and as such Bhaktapur itself was once an enormous lake. Geological surveys conducted by Swiss geologist Toni Hagen proved that the Kathmandu Valley was in fact a lake which formed when the Lower Himalayan Range was being created due to the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plate. The lake water started eroding the limestone hills of Chobhar and starting from around thirty thousand years ago, the lake started to drain. Plain lands appeared in the valley and between 30,000 and 15,000 years, most of the valley was drained. In folklore, the credit of draining the valley is given to the Bodhisattva Manjushri . Believed to be a saint from Greater China, Manjushri is said to have cut a gorge from his sword in order to drain the valley so that he could worship and gain wisdom from Swayambhunath Buddha who resided in the lake. Manjushri is believed to have entered the Katmandu Valley from the east and his resting place has been made into a shrine where the people of Bhaktapur make a pilgrimage to every year during late winter and before the festival of Shree Panchami.

Apart from above, much of the early history of Bhaktapur is largely unknown. It is clear that people started to settle in the Kathmandu Valley after it was drained due to its fertile soil owing to it being a lakebed. The Gopal Raj Vamshavali, a 14th-century Newar language manuscript states that a clan known as Gopāla first settled the Kathmandu Valley. The manuscript further says that Gopāla, who were cow herders, were overthrown by the Mahispāla, who were buffalo herders. Soon, the Kirata King Yalambar conquered the valley and established his own Kirānta dynasty. Although no direct proof of the existence of the first three ruling dynasties as mentioned in the Gopal Raj Vamshavali has been found, indirect proof such as place names and mentions in the inscriptions of the Licchavi period has been used to support the existence of at least the Kirānta dynasty. For Bhaktapur as well, the existence of a non-Sanskrit name, &quot;Khopring,&quot; in the Sanskrit language stone inscriptions of the Licchavi dynasty supports the existence of a settlement before the arrival of the Licchavi clan from Vaishali. The modern day &quot;Jyāpu&quot; community of the Newars is believed to be the descendants of the Kirānta clan and the modern day Newar language is believed to derived from the language that he Kirānta clan spoke.

=== Licchavi dynasty ===
Three stone inscriptions from the Licchavi dynasty has been recovered so far in Bhaktapur. One of them dated to 594 was recovered in &quot;Gomārhi&quot; district in the eastern part of Bhaktapur was made during the reign of Amshuverma. Another similar inscription from 594, recovered from &quot;Tulāche&quot; district in the central part of Bhaktapur was also made during the reign of Amshuverma. The &quot;Gomārhi&quot; inscription contains a decree from Amshuverma that &quot;people from &quot;Mākhopring draṅga&quot; should be given more rights for a self rule.&quot; Similarly, the &quot;Tulāche&quot; inscription contains a similar message but the settlement has been referred as &quot;&quot;khōpring grāma&quot;. During the Licchavi dynasty, settlements with a minimum of 100 houses and a maximum of 500 houses were classified as &quot;grāma&quot; and wealthy settlements were classified as &quot;draṅga&quot;&quot;. So, the settlements around the present day &quot;Gomārhi&quot; district were wealthier than the settlements around the present day &quot;Tulāche&quot; district. In Nepal Bhasa, &quot;Mā&quot; is a prefix meaning &quot;main or principal&quot;, meaning Mākhopring&quot; was a &quot;sub-division&quot; of Khopring, &quot;most likely the main part of Khopring. Finally, a third inscription recovered at &quot;Tālako&quot; district in the southwestern part of Bhaktapur mention the place name as &quot;mākhoduluṃ&quot; which was probably a separate village from &quot;Khōpring&quot;.&quot;

Bhaktapur&#x27;s oldest hiti is also dated from the Licchavi dynasty. It is said that the Rajkulo canals, which supplies water in hitis were built and managed by Tulā Rāni, a mythical queen who is believed to have lived in Bhaktapur during the Licchavi dynasty. In folklore, Tulā Rāni made and repaired the Rajkulo canals as she is said to only weigh a single tola or 11 grams and hence float on water.

=== Foundation ===
In the 14th century Gopal Raj Vamshavali, Ananda Deva, who ruled Nepal Mandala from 1146 to 1167 is credited to have established the city of Bhaktapur. Since there were already settlements in Bhaktapur like &quot;Mākhopring&quot; and M&quot;ākhoduluṃ&quot; during the Licchavi dynasty, it was more likely that Ananda Deva unified these smaller settlements into a single unit. It is traditionally believed that Bhaktapur contained 12,000 houses at the time of its foundation. Ananda Deva also established a royal court named &quot;Tripura Rājkula&quot; in the central part of Bhaktapur and declared it as the new capital of Nepal. The Gopal Raj Vamsavali also state the foundation of shrines of eight Matrikas surrounding the city and a ninth and the most important shrine, that of Tripura Sundari, at the centre of the town. This arrangement of the shrines of mother goddess is used to conceptualize the entire town as a sacred Mandala. Within the city itself, there are also ten minor shrines of the Mahavidya established by Ananda Deva as well. The later 19th century chronicles state that Ananda Deva was directed to establish Bhaktapur by the Goddess Annapurna.

=== Capital city of Nepal ===
As Bhaktapur became the seat of the government, it also became the target for numerous foreign invasions. The main reasons for these attacks was the internal division among the royal family of Nepal. Soon after Ananda Deva&#x27;s death, a new royal house emerged from within. Believed to have been started by Ari Malla, they used Malla as their surname replacing their ancestral surname, Deva. When the conflictions between both houses worsened, the House of Tripura sought help from Tirhut while the House of Yuthunimam sought help from Khasa Kingdom. Thus, both of these kingdoms started interfering in the internal politics of Nepal. In the 1310s, the monarch Rudra Malla in order to improve Nepal Mandal&#x27;s relation with Tirhut married off his sister Devaladevi to the Tirhut king, Harisimhadeva. After the marriage, the relation between the two kingdoms smoothed and Tirhut&#x27;s attack on Nepal ceased.

In the month of January 1326, Devaladevi along with son, Jagatsimhadeva and her court departed from Tirhut after it was invaded and captured by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq, the Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate. Her husband Harisimhadeva died on the way while Devaladevi and her family arrived at her birth kingdom of Nepal Mandala where she was welcomed by her brother Rudra Malla. In July 1326, just six months after the arrival of Devaldevi, her brother Rudra Malla died. Nayakdevi, Rudra Malla&#x27;s daughter became the new ruler of Nepal Mandala under the regency of her grandmother Padma Lakshmi. In 1326, Nayakdevi was married to Harishchandra, the prince of Kashi by her grandmother but the court rebelled against him after the death of Padma Lakshmi at the age of sixty seven in July 1332 and was eventually assassinated in May 1335. After Harischandra&#x27;s death, Devaladevi in a bid to gain political power married her son Jagatsimhadeva to her niece Nayakdevi. In January 1347, Nayakdevi gave birth to a daughter who was named Rajya Laksmhi Devi (Rajaldevi in short). Nayakdevi died ten days after giving birth to Rajaldevi. Her death triggered a chain of unrests in the palace during which Jagatsimha was imprisoned and he died in custody. Devaldevi established her own rule in Nepal Mandala as regent for her granddaughter/grandniece, Rajaldevi. In 1349, Nepal suffered one of the most devastating attack in its history. Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, the Sultan of Bengal and his armies plundered the Nepal Valley for a week in the winter of 1349. Bhaktapur suffered the most from this attack as not only it was the capital at that time, the city was also in the eastern part of the valley, the same direction the 20,000 forces came from. According to the Gopal Raj Vamshavali, Bhaktapur was ransacked and set on fire by the invaders which lasted for seven days and the populace were either killed or escaped in the mountains. Some historians cite this invasion as the reason for the disappearance of monuments from the Licchavi and the early Malla dynasty. After the invasion, which destroyed much of the city, Bhaktapur was entirely rebuilt under Devaldevi, who like Ananda Deva, did so on the basis of Sanskrit treatises in architecture. The layout of the old part of the city has remained mostly the same since then.
In September 1354, a nine year old Jayasthiti, a Danwar noble from Mithila was brought into Bhaktapur and was eventually married to Rajalladevi Malla in January 1355. After Devaladevi died in 1366, Rajalladevi and her king consort Jayasthiti Malla took control of Nepal Mandala and under their reign Nepal experienced a period of stability and cultural as well as economic growth. Jayasthiti Malla defeated warring nobles and unified Nepal Mandala under a singular monarch. It is said that Jayasthiti Malla brought Brahmins from Mithila and South India and under their recommendation, revived and improved the already present Hindu caste system based on occupation. Jayasthiti Malla is also credited for making the Newar language as the language of administration, literature and religion. The influential Gopal Raj Vamshavali, a Newar language manuscript about the history of Nepal, was commissioned by Jayasthiti Malla. Jayasthiti Malla was also the first monarch of Nepal to claim a divine heritage as the Gopal Raj Vamshavali states him as the one blessed by Swayambhunath and the incarnation of the Buddha, a claim inherited by all future monarchs.
His grandson, Yakshya Malla was the last king of a unified Nepal Mandala who ruled from Bhaktapur from 1428 to 1481. Yaksha Malla had numerous wives and concubines including Sarupādevī, Karpuradevī, Udayādevī, Jīvalakṣmī, Jayatanā, Kṛtilakṣmī, Sarasvatidevī (among which Sarupādevī and Karpuradevī were the most influential) and therefore numerous issue. He is also known to have fortified his capital, Bhaktapur with moats, defensive walls and eight city gates which correspond with the shrines of the Eight Matrikas. He also made it mandatory for all citizens of Bhaktapur regardless of caste or wealth, to repair and maintain the defensive walls and moats during the annual festival of Sithi Nakha. Yaksha Malla&#x27;s numerous children caused a huge issue in the kingdom after his death in 1481. His eldest son was Raya Malla and because of his age, he was crowned as the new king of the country. But his two step-brothers Ratna and Ari Malla and his step-sister Ratnādevī, all three of whom shared the same biological mother protested against the coronation and as a result broke off from the capital and established a new one in Kathmandu where Ratna Malla declared himself the king. Similarly, Raṇa Malla shared a same biological mother Rana Malla broke off from the capital to Banepa where he declared himself as its new king. In this way, the kingdom of Yaksha Malla was divided among his sons among which Raya Malla, the eldest became the king of the former capital city, Bhaktapur.

=== Kingdom of Bhaktapur ===
Raya Malla is considered a weak figure in the History of Nepal. Many historians blame Raya Malla&#x27;s reluctancy to give up the throne for the division of Nepal Mandala. The newly formed Kantipur kingdom and its king barred him from taking any oaths and Diksha from their tutelary goddess, Taleju whose shrine was located in the palace of Bhaktapur while at the same Ratna Malla would repeatedly take oaths from the Taleju shrine of the Bhaktapur palace. Yaksha Malla&#x27;s large number of descendants meant that even during his great-grandson – Praṇa Malla&#x27;s reign there were several other members of the Malla family were still in Bhaktapur. Two such Mallas, Vira and Gosain Malla, both of whom were older than the monarch sought help from Kantipur and the king of Kantipur, Narendra Malla in a bid to weaken Bhaktapur, claimed Vira Malla to be the legitimate ruler. Likely fueled by Narendra Malla, both Vira and Gosain Malla divided the city of Bhaktapur between themselves and Prana Malla and established a border at &quot;Inācho&quot;, Bhaktapur. In October 1558 Ganga Devi, the queen consort of Vishva Malla seized control of the kingdom and started a joint rule with her two sons Trailokya and Tribhuvan Malla. Ganga Devi, who was also popularly called as &quot;Ganga Maharani&quot;, was the only queen regnant who ruled the kingdom. During her reign, Bhaktapur would reach its territorial zenith. She is regarded as the first strong ruler of Bhaktapur Kingdom and is widely known for her military conquest and construction works. She is also credited with unifying the city by appointing many of Yaksha Malla&#x27;s descendants who were living in the palace as fort captains, chiefs of other cities and villages within the kingdom which effectively ended their claims to the throne. She was the first ruler of Bhaktapur to take Diksha from Taleju along with her two sons, the tutelary goddess of the Mallas in 9 April 1567 as previous rulers were barred to do so by Kantipur, which provoked Kantipur and launched an attack Bhaktapur in retaliation. Her reign saw numerous cultural changes in the form of festivals as she is credited to have improved the numerous festivals celebrated within the kingdom. The locals of Bhaktapur credit her as the builder of many of the &quot;hitis&quot; and public rest houses within Bhaktapur as well as numerous Narayana temples of the city but no any inscriptional evidence of it has been found.

Ganga Devi&#x27;s death has not been properly studied yet. It is possible that she died in 1602 as after 1602, her eldest son Trailokya Malla is the only one addressed as the king in inscriptions and legal documents. Her youngest son, Tribhvana Malla who arguably was more powerful under her disappeared from historical records since 1602. Trailokya Malla ruled alone till his death in 1613 after which his son, Jagajjyoti Malla became the ruler. Jagajjyoti Malla is especially remembered for his contributions in Maithili literature. His work, &quot;Haragaurīvivāha,&quot; a play about the wedding of Shiva to Parvati, is considered one of the greatest works in the Maithili language. After Jagajjyoti Malla died in 1642, Naresha Malla&#x27;s short rule began. Naresha Malla proved to be a weak king and it was during his reign that Pratap Malla, the king of Kantipur, in his attempt to unify the Kathmandu Valley, attacked Bhaktapur. Naresha Malla died at an early age, leaving behind a four year old Jagat Prakasha Malla as the successor to the throne. His aunt, Annapurṇalaksmi served as regent for him till he turned 16. Meanwhile, Pratap Malla made an alliance with Srinivasa Malla, the king of Patan and both joined forces to start a siege of Bhaktapur. By 1660, the coalition conquered all the hamlets and villages, north of Bhaktapur and managed to reach the northern city gate. The coalition tried to break the gate open for months before being forced to retreat. During their siege, Pratap Malla installed a stone inscription on a &quot;hiti&quot; in the shrine of Mahakali near the northern gate. During April 1662, Pratap Malla had gathered a massive army in the eastern part of Bhaktapur, in the site outside the city proper where the annual Biska Jatra festival was held demanding the festival will only be held if the kingdom surrendered. Jagat Prakasha Malla released decree cancelling the festival that year, a first time where the festival was cancelled. Eventually, the sieges proved unsuccessful and the coalition were forced to retreat.

Jagat Prakasha Malla died on 8 December 1672 because of smallpox after which the reign of Jitamitra Malla began. He is fondly remembered for the construction of a canal which brought water to the city from the hills of Nagarkot. His son, Bhupatindra Malla, who succeeded him in 1696 is likely the most popular ruler from Bhaktapur because of the numerous construction works that took place during his reign. The Nyatapola, today a symbol and landmark of the city was commissioned by him. His son Ranajit Malla was the last ruler of the Kingdom of Bhaktapur and is remembered today for his musical contributions and talents. The Newar language devotional songs he wrote are still sung in Bhaktapur today.

In November 1769, Bhaktapur was attacked and after suffering a heavy loss, the state eventually surrendered to the expanding Gorkha kingdom, which would become the future Kingdom of Nepal.

=== Rana Regime ===
After its defeat in 1769, Bhaktapur lost most of its political and cultural importance to Kathmandu and Lalitpur, the capital of the newly formed Kingdom of Nepal. Bhaktapur was visited by Colonel Kirkpatrick of East India Company in 1792 and in his book described the city as being in a better state than Kathmandu or Lalitpur. Bhaktapur played a small role during the rise of Jung Bahadur Rana as its former palace was where King Rajendra Bikram Shah was imprisoned in 1847. After the establishment of the Rana dynasty in 1846, Rana&#x27;s brother Dhir Shumsher Rana was appointed as the mayor of the city. Dhir Shumsher oversaw the demolition of many of the old palaces of Bhaktapur and its replacement with British style inspired buildings.
The great earthquake of 1833 and 1934 devastated most of the city including the palace and temples. In the earthquake of 1833 especially, Bhaktapur suffered the most damage in the Kathmandu Valley. Out of 500 total casualties of the earthquake, at least 200 of them were in Bhaktapur. Around 25% to 70% of the town suffered major destruction, including at least 2,000 homes and six to eight temples.

When the 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck in 1934, Bhaktapur was one of the most affected towns of Nepal. Around 40-100% of residential buildings were directly affected while 6224 buildings were completely destroyed by the earthquake. Many of the old palaces and temples which were already weakened by the earthquake of 1833 were also completely destroyed. Almost all the buildings in Bhaktapur Durbar Square were heavily damaged. Around 177 heritages were completely destroyed during the earthquake.

Many of the Malla era temples and palaces of the city like the &quot;Basantapur Lyākū&quot;, &quot;Chaukot Lyākū&quot; and &quot;Thanthu Lyākū&quot; were completely destroyed in the earthquakes and many of them were never restored and the few that were, were reconstructed in a Mughal style stucco dome by the Ranas.

The economy of Bhaktapur, which had already been struggling after losing the flow of Tibetan traders, was acceleratedly aggravated by the earthquakes of 1833 and 1934. The 1934 earthquake also damaged the physical infrastructure of the town and most of the inhabitants were unable to rebuild their houses properly. The earthquake permanently damaged the Rajkulo canals that had been providing fresh water to the city since the time of the Mallas. Due to the malaise economy and cash-strapped budget, Bhaktapur was unable to revamp these broken canals, as a result, fresh water became scarce in the city.. The sanitation level of Bhaktapur became severely low and poverty and diseases became rampant.

=== 20th century ===
In the 1950s, when the tyrannical Rana dynasty ended and Nepal was open up to the outside world, Kathmandu and the other cities around it like Patan saw a considerable rise in urbanization and population. However, Bhaktapur was farther away from the capital and was left out from the development that occurred in the other cities of the Kathmandu Valley. Bhaktapur was also greatly isolated and ignored by the central powers. When a new highway was built, it completely bypassed the city and instead ran through the outskirts. Consequently, Bhaktapur was the poorest city of Nepal in the 20th century. The Rajkulo canals that provided fresh water was never repaired and sanitation level was very low. Due to extremely high population density and low sanitation, the city became extremely unhygienic as feces and litter filled the roads. Diseases and pandemics were rampant and greatly affected the farmers composing the majority population of Bhaktapur, who couldn&#x27;t afford necessary modern medicine. Just like its inhabitants, the heritages of Bhaktapur also suffered greatly during this period as many arts and artifacts were stolen.

Under the Bhaktapur Development Project which was funded by West Germany, the city&#x27;s physical infrastructure and heritage sites were all revitalized and renovated. Tourism started to became a major source for Bhaktapur&#x27;s economy. A political party named Nepal Workers Peasants Party was started in the city and it gained the support of majority farmer population of the city.

===2015 earthquake===
A magnitude of 7.8 Richter earthquake 2015 Nepal earthquake that struck on 25 April 2015 (12 Baisakh 2072 B.S., Saturday, at local time 11:56am) damaged 116 heritages in the city. 67 of those heritages were completely damaged while 49 suffered from partial damages. The earthquake badly damaged the Bhaktapur Durbar square, a significant historial heritage site included in the UNESCO world heritage list. The main premises of Taleju Temple also witnessed damages in the disaster.

The Nepal-Bihar earthquake in 1934 demolished several buildings that were never rebuilt. Chyasilin Mandap has been rebuilt in 1990 using contemporary earthquake proof technology. The building survived the 2015 earthquake unharmed.

==Demographics==
A song composed by Ranajit Malla in 1769 mention Bhaktapur as a city with 12,000 households. Henry Ambrose Oldfield who visited Nepal during the 1850s wrote that there were fifty thousand inhabitants in Bhaktapur.

At the time of the 2001 Nepal census, it had a population of 72,543. The 2011 Nepal census reports the population of Bhaktapur as 81,748 with 41,081 men and 40,667 women. The results of the 2021 Nepal census put the population of Bhaktapur at 79,136 with the population of men at 39,755 and of women at 39,381, respectively, and the total number of households at 18,987. Around 90% of the population of Bhaktapur belong to the Newar ethnic group.

== Culture ==

=== Architecture and art ===

Bhaktapur, being a former capital of a Newar kingdom, contains one of the most elaborate art pieces of Nepal. Only a few artworks from the Lichhavi dynasty survive in Bhaktapur and so most art pieces date from the Malla dynasty. Most of Bhaktapur&#x27;s art were religious in nature and were made by anonymous artists coming from a caste of artisans. A few artisans however are known. For instance, the painter who made the murals on the walls of the palace of fifty windows has signed his name on one of the murals. However, many of the murals in the palace were damaged when it used as a post office and a police station in the 20th century and the painter&#x27;s signature has unfortunately been rubbed off, with only his address remaining readable today.

Woodcarving is a major artwork of the Kathmandu Valley. Most of the wooden work from the Lichhavi dynasty that survives today are wooden struts or posts which mostly depicted Salabhanjikas, the forest fairies or deities in a similar pose. Four armed deities began appearing since the 16th century and by the end of the Malla dynasty, wooden struts depicted multi armed Hindu deities. This transformation was not viewed fondly by all scholars citing the loss of elegance in later wooden struts. &quot;Toraṇa&quot; or tympanums are in most cases wooden as well and can be found on most temples, monasteries or palaces. The wooden &quot;toraṇa&quot; on the entrance to the Taleju temple in Bhaktapur Durbar Square is considered one of the best examples of the kind. Similarly, Newar window are an important aspect of Nepalese architecture. The &quot;Mhekhājhya&quot;, or more popularly the Peacock window from 1750 is the most popular traditional window from Bhaktapur. The Malla dynasty was, for Bhaktapur a golden age for woodcarving, sculpture and the arts in general.

Similar to woodcarving, very few stone or metal sculptures from the Licchavi dynasty survive in Bhaktapur and so almost all surviving works are from the Malla dynasty. Most stone sculptures are of deities housed in various temples of the city and their leonine guardians. The most celebrated sculptors from Bhaktapur lived during the late 17th to early 18th centuries. These artisans, whose identity has no been properly known yet, carved some of the most popular stone works of the city including the Narasimha, Hanuman, Devi and Bhairava sculptures near the entrance to former palaces, numerous sculptures in the restricted courtyards of the palace and the relief of Devi inside the Nyatapola. The ledger work of the construction of the Nyatapola mention Tulasi Lohankami as the leader of thirty sculptors, so it is likely that his group may have been the one responsible for all aforementioned works.

The &quot;Luṁ dhvākā&quot; or the Golden gate which serves as an entrance to the inner courtyards of the former royal palace was constructed between 1751 and 1754 by Subhākara, Karuṇākara and Ratikara. It is considered one of the most important works of Nepalese art. Just as popular as the Golden Gate is the gold plated bronze statue of Bhupatindra Malla placed on a stone pillar in front of the gate, crafted by a smith from Kathmandu.

=== Hiti ===
The entirety of Kathmandu Valley, including Bhaktapur is known for its &quot;hiti&quot; water supply system which once supplied water from the surroundings hills into the heart of the cities of the valley. These fountains are carved in the form of a Hindu and Buddhist mythical creature known as a &quot;hitimanga.&quot; The hiti water supply system was developed in the Licchavi dynasty and Bhaktapur&#x27;s oldest hitis also date from the period. Today, there is at least one &quot;hiti&quot; in each of Bhaktapur&#x27;s neighborhood totaling to about 104. The hitis were made not only by royals and nobles, but also by common people as well. There was a common belief that building hitis and rest houses grant the builder religious merit. Hitis whose spouts face eastwards, of which there are 18, hold religious significance to the locals as it is considered pious to bathe in these spouts during Sa Paru. This practice has gone extinct today as most of these spouts do not work any longer as the canals that supplied them has been lost to time. These aqueduct-like canal system were called Rajkulo, the earliest such canal in Bhaktapur was believed to be built by a mythical queen &quot;Tulā Rāni&quot;, who according to folklore floated on water owing to her light weight. In 1379, Jayasthiti Malla repaired a damaged Rajkulo of Bhaktapur and in the same year a new one named &quot;Yaṭapāṭa&quot; was built in the city. The most famous Rajkulo of Bhaktapur was commissioned by Jitamitra Malla in 1677 that brought water from the hills of Nagarkot to the city. All of these Rajkulos in Bhaktapur have gone extinct today. &quot;Jahru&quot; are a type of water tank made out of stone which can be found around wells and hitis of the city. These are usually carved with floral motifs and the image of Bhagiratha.

=== Ponds ===

There are 50 artificial ponds/lakes (, &quot;pukhu&quot;), constructed in the Licchavi and the Malla dynasty, in the city. Of them the largest four, SIddha Pokhari (&quot;Taḥ pukhu&quot;), &quot;Naḥ pukhu&quot;, &quot;Bhājyā pukhu&quot; and Rani Pokhari (&quot;nhu pukhu&quot;) are located in the western part of the city and among them the largest one, Siddha Pokhari (&quot;Taḥ pukhu&quot;) measures 574×249 ft. The two oldest known ponds of the city are &quot;Taḥ pukhu&quot; and &quot;Naḥ pukhu&quot; built in 1118 and 1168 respectively. Kamal Pokhari (&quot;bāhre&quot; &quot;pukhu&quot;), another large pond on the eastern part of town is believed to be from the Licchavi dynasty, though no definitive proof has been found of its antiquity.

A lot of the smaller ponds in the dense settlements of city were built in the Malla dynasty as a sort of water supply during a fire. These ponds also have cultural and religious significance, along with agricultural ones. For instance, Kamal Pokhari (&quot;bāhre pukhu&quot;), in the local folklore, is considered the residence of Tula Rani, a mythical queen weighing only one Tula. Bhājyā pukhu, located in the western part of the city and directly south of Siddha Pokhari, is similar to Rani Pokhari of Kathmandu as both of them have an island in their centre with a temple in it. It was commissioned by Bhāju Kasa, a late 17th century official of Bhaktapur and has many folklore associated with it. Similarly, &quot;Nhu pukhu&quot; built in 1629 by Jagajjyoti Malla was popularly called Rani Pukhu, meaning queen of ponds, because of its beauty. &quot;Naḥ pukhu&quot; was believed to have built in a single night by a wizard in 1168, hence it is also called &quot;Guhya pukhu,&quot; meaning secretive pond.

=== Phalcha ===

&quot;Phalchā&quot; is a Newar word for communal resting places which has been a part of Nepali culture since the Lichhavi dynasty. Usually, they are attached to an existing building or free standing with their front façade colonnaded with widely spaced wooden posts. These &quot;phalchā&quot; see extensive use by the locals as a communal gathering places.

It was considered religiously pious to consecrate &quot;phalcas&quot; and today there are 364 &quot;phalcas&quot; in Bhaktapur consecrated with most dating from the Malla dynasty. The two largest ones are located in Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the former royal palace square. Mandapa and Sattal are another type of rest houses found in Nepal. Mandapa, like a &quot;phalchā,&quot; is a thatch-roofed platform but they are always free-standing and have sixteen colonnades, four on each side. Many mandapa in Bhaktapur have a second storey like the &quot;Chyāsilim mandapa&quot; of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Sattal are almost always multi-storied public buildings which serves as a shrine for a deity and in the past was used as a habitation for pilgrims and travelers.

== Language ==

Bhaktapur Newar (, &quot;khvapaḥ bhāy&quot;) is a distinct dialect of Newar language spoken in Bhaktapur and its environs. Generally, the vocabulary is similar to that of the standard dialect (standard refers to the Newar spoken in Kathmandu and Lalitpur) with some pronunciation changes but differences do exist. The most widely known difference is for the word &quot;laḥ&quot; (, &quot;water&quot;) which becomes &quot;nā&quot; () in the Bhaktapur dialect. This difference is often used humorously as &quot;nā&quot; in the standard dialect means &quot;mud&quot; and &quot;laḥ&quot; in the Bhaktapur dialect means &quot;drool&quot;. Terminologies relating to traditional musical instruments are also different between the two dialects. In a lot of words, the &quot;ā&quot; sound in the standard dialect is replaced with &quot;a&quot; sound and vice versa. Similarly, Bhaktpaur Newar has a voiced velar nasal sound &quot;, that is not present in the standard dialect. For instance, the Nyatapola is called as &quot;&quot; (&quot;ṅātāpola&quot;) in Bhaktapur whereas in the standard dialect its name is &quot;&quot;(n&quot;yātāpau&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

=== Literature ===
Jagat Sundar Malla, born in 1882 is considered one of the Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa who headed a revival campaign of Nepal Bhasa after its supersession by the royal government. Similarly, Ram Sekhar Nakarmi who was a major modern day Nepal Bhasa writer was also from Bhaktapur. Narayan Man Bijukchhe is also a prominent author, mostly writing political books in the Nepali language.

Before Nepal Bhasa became the official language in the Malla dynasty, most literature was written in Sanskrit and even during the Malla dynasty, Sanskrit was an important literary language. Historical documents written in the Newar language first began appearing since the 14th century. Many literary pieces were written in the Newar language in Bhaktapur during the Malla dynasty. The influential Gopal Raj Vamshavali, a book about the history of Nepal was written in Bhaktapur by an anonymous writer from Panauti. Like other artworks, most literature of Bhaktapur before the 20th century were written by anonymous authors and are generally attributed to the ruling monarch because it was a common practice to mention a monarch&#x27;s name. However, the names of a few non royal writers from Bhaktapur are known. For instance, two poems written by &quot;Keshav Udās&quot; is still preserved in the National Archives of Nepal. He was active from 1604 to 1611 and both of his remaining works are romantic narrative poems. Among royal writers, Ranajit Malla and his queen consort Briddhi Lakshmi who are among the most popular historical authors, the former mostly remembered for his plays and the later for her poems. Ranajit Malla&#x27;s &quot;&quot;hāya hāya rāma rāma&quot; and Briddhi Lakshmi&#x27;s &quot;ka kha yā mye&quot;&quot; are noted for their historical as well as literary importance.

==Main sights==
Bhaktapur is one of the most visited sites of Nepal popular among both foreign and domestic visitors. The most visited site of Bhaktapur are the city&#x27;s four squares, which all except for one are concentrated on the middle part of Bhaktapur. The first of them is the Durbar Square, the former royal palace complex of Bhaktapur, composed of houses of the former royal palace and various temples that were built in its vicinity. Although, the Durbar Square of Bhaktapur received heavy damage from both the 1934 and 2015 earthquake, while many of the fallen monuments have been reconstructed. The Durbar square houses various monuments like the palace of fifty five windows, the &quot;Simhādhwākhā Lyākū&quot; palace which houses the National Art Gallery, one of the first museum of Nepal, and the stone temples of Vatsala Devi and Siddhi Lakshmi. The temple of &quot;Silu Māhādeo&quot; (meaning &quot;the Shiva of Silu&quot;) located on the eastern part of Bhaktapur Durbar Square is the tallest Shikhara style building in Nepal.

===Taumadhi Square===
The Taumadhi Square (, &quot;Tamārhi&quot;) houses the Nyatapola temple, the five storeyed temple commissioned by King Bhupatindra Malla and shrines for the tantric goddess Siddhi Lakshmi, the personal deity of the royal couple. Under the shadow of Nyatapola stands the three storey temple associated with Bhairava which was first built by Vishva Malla and then later remodeled by Jagajjyoti Malla in its present form. The square also contains the courtyard of Til Mādhav Narayana, the &quot;Aesāmārhi satta&quot; (often called the Kasthamandap of Bhaktapur)&quot;,&quot; the Betala temple and a golden &quot;hiti.&quot; The Shikhara temple of Jagannath and the roofed temple of Lakshmi Narasimha are also established near the square.

===Dattatraya Square===
The Dattatraya Square located in the Tachapal tole (Nepal bhasa: Devanagari=तचपाल, Pracalit script=𑐟𑐔𑐥𑐵𑐮) is one of the oldest monument of the town. The Dattatraya Square consists of the three-story pagoda-style Dattatraya Temple, dedicated to Guru Dattatreya, which is the combined form and avatar of three principal Hindu deities, (Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Maheswora the destroyer, respectively), was built during the reign of King Yaksha Malla (1428 A.D. – 1482 A.D.) and was opened to the public around 1486 A.D., only after his demise. The exact date of construction of the Dattatraya temple is still obscure. This temple, according to popular belief, was constructed from a single piece of wood from one tree. At the entrance are two large sculptures of the Jaiput wrestlers(locally known as &quot;kutuwo&quot;), Jaimala and Pata (as in the Nyatapola Temple), a &quot;Chakra&quot;, and a gilded metal statue of Garuda, a bird-like divinity. Around the temple are wood carved panels with erotic decorations. It was subsequently repaired and renovated by King Vishwa Malla in 1548 A.D. The Dattatraya Square is also the home to the Pujari Math which was the former palace of the Malla Kings and court and later served as the settlement for the priests of the temple and Tibetan traders. Today, the Pujari Math has been converted into a Woodcraft and Bronze Museum. The Pujari Matha is mostly noted for its artistic windows including the popular &quot;Mhaykhā Jhyā&quot; (lit. Peacock Window). In front of the Dattatraya temple is the Bhimsena Temple, which is dedicated to Bhin:dyo, the Newari deity of commerce often confused with the Pandava brother Bhimsena.

===Changu Narayan===

Changu Narayan is an ancient Hindu temple located near the modern village of Changunarayan in the Kathmandu Valley on top of a hill at the eastern end of the valley. It is to the north of Bhakathapur and from Kathmandu. The temple is one of the oldest Hindu temples of the valley and is believed to have been constructed first in the 4th century. Changu Narayan is named after Vishnu, and the temple is dedicated to him. A stone slab discovered in the vicinity of the temple dates to the 5th century and is the oldest such stone inscription discovered in Nepal. It was rebuilt after the old temple was devastated. Many of the stone sculptures date to the Licchavi period. Changu Narayan Temple is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

The temple is a double-roofed structure where the idol of Lord Vishnu in his incarnation as Narayana is enshrined. The temple has intricate roof struts showing multi-armed Tantric deities. A kneeling image of Garuda (dated to the 5th century), the vahana or vehicle of Vishnu with a snake around its neck, faces the temple. The gilded door depicts stone lions guarding the temple. Gilded windows also flank the door. A conch and a disc, symbols of Vishnu, are carved on the two pillars at the entrance. Non-Hindus are not allowed to enter the temple.
==In popular culture==
In 1974, Pier Paolo Pasolini used Bhaktapur, along with other places in Nepal, as locations for his film &quot;Il fiore delle Mille e una notte&quot; (Arabian Nights).

Portions of the 1993 Hollywood film &quot;Little Buddha&quot; starring Keanu Reeves and Bridget Fonda were filmed in the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. Also, some portions of Indian films &quot;Hare Rama Hare Krishna&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot; were shot in Bhaktapur.

<text>An ejection fraction (EF) is the volumetric fraction (or portion of the total) of fluid (usually blood) ejected from a chamber (usually the heart) with each contraction (or heartbeat). It can refer to the cardiac atrium, cardiac ventricle, gall bladder, or leg veins, although if unspecified it usually refers to the left ventricle of the heart. EF is widely used as a measure of the pumping efficiency of the heart and is used to classify heart failure types. It is also used as an indicator of the severity of heart failure, although it has recognized limitations.

The EF of the left heart, known as the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), is calculated by dividing the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat (stroke volume) by the volume of blood present in the left ventricle at the end of diastolic filling (end-diastolic volume). LVEF is an indicator of the effectiveness of pumping into the systemic circulation. The EF of the right heart, or right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), is a measure of the efficiency of pumping into the pulmonary circulation. A heart which cannot pump sufficient blood to meet the body&#x27;s requirements (i.e., heart failure) will often, but not invariably, have a reduced ventricular ejection fraction.

In heart failure, the difference between heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, is significant, because the two types are treated differently.

==Measurement==
Modalities applied to measurement of ejection fraction is an emerging field of medical mathematics and subsequent computational applications. The first common measurement method is echocardiography, although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cardiac computed tomography, ventriculography and nuclear medicine (gated SPECT and radionuclide angiography) scans may also be used. Measurements by different modalities are not easily interchangeable. Historically, the gold standard for measurement of the ejection fraction was ventriculography, but cardiac MRI is now considered the best method. Prior to these more advanced techniques, the combination of electrocardiography and phonocardiography was used to accurately estimate ejection fraction.

==Physiology==

===Normal values===
In a healthy man, the stroke volume is approximately 70 mL, and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV) is approximately 120 mL, giving an estimated ejection fraction of , or 0.58 (58%). Healthy individuals typically have ejection fractions between 50% and 65%, although the lower limits of normality are difficult to establish with confidence.

== Pathophysiology ==

=== Heart failure categories ===
Damage to heart muscle (myocardium), such as occurring following myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy, compromises the heart&#x27;s performance as an efficient pump and may reduce ejection fraction. This broadly understood distinction marks an important determinant between ischemic vs. nonischemic heart failure. Such reduction in the EF can manifest itself as heart failure. The 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure subdivided heart failure into three categories on the basis of LVEF:
# normal or preserved LVEF [≥50%] (HFpEF)
# moderately reduced LVEF [in the range of 41–49%] (HFmrEF)
# reduced LVEF [≤40%] (HFrEF)]
A chronically low ejection fraction less than 30% is an important threshold in qualification for disability benefits in the US.

==Calculation==
By definition, the volume of blood within a ventricle at the end of diastole is the end-diastolic volume (EDV). Likewise, the volume of blood left in a ventricle at the end of systole (contraction) is the end-systolic volume (ESV). The difference between EDV and ESV is the stroke volume (SV). The ejection fraction is the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected with each beat; that is, it is stroke volume (SV) divided by end-diastolic volume (EDV):

formula_1

Where the stroke volume is given by:

formula_2

EF is inherently a relative measurement—as is any fraction, ratio, or percentage, whereas the stroke volume, end-diastolic volume or end-systolic volume are absolute measurements.

==History==
William Harvey described the basic mechanism of the systemic circulation in his 1628 &quot;De motu cordis&quot;. It was initially assumed that the heart emptied completely during systole. However, in 1856 Chauveau and Faivre observed that some fluid remained in the heart after contraction. This was confirmed by Roy and Adami in 1888. In 1906, Henderson estimated the ratio of the volume discharged in systole to the total volume of the left ventricle to be approximately 2/3. In 1933, Gustav Nylin proposed that the ratio of the heart volume/stroke volume (the reciprocal of ejection fraction) could be used as a measure of cardiac function. In 1952, Bing and colleagues used a minor modification of Nylin&#x27;s suggestion (EDV/SV) to assess right ventricular function using a dye dilution technique. Exactly when the relationship between end diastolic volume and stroke volume was inverted into its current form is unclear. Holt calculated the ratio SV/EDV and noted that &#x27;...The ventricle empties itself in a &quot;fractional&quot; manner, approximately 46 per cent of its end-diastolic volume being ejected with each stroke and 54 per cent remaining in the ventricle at the end of systole&#x27;.

In 1962, Folse and Braunwald used the ratio of forward stroke volume/EDV and observed that &quot;estimations of the fraction of the left ventricular end-diastolic volume that is ejected into the aorta during each cardiac cycle, as well as of the ventricular end-diastolic and residual volumes, provide information that is fundamental to a hemodynamic analysis of left ventricular function&quot;. Elliott, Lane and Gorlin used the term &quot;ejection fraction&quot; in a conference paper abstract published in January 1964. In 1965, Bartle et al. used the term ejected fraction for the ratio SV/EDV, and the term ejection fraction was used in two review articles in 1968 suggesting a wide currency by that time.

<text>Yangpu () is one of the 16 districts of Shanghai. It is located in the northeastern part of downtown Shanghai, bordering the Huangpu River on the east and south, Hongkou on the west, and Baoshan on the north. The southern part of Yangpu District is away from The Bund, a major tourist attraction. It is predominantly composed of residential communities, with a total area of and a population of 1,242,548 as of 2020. The district administers 12 subdistricts.

==Name==
The name Yangshupu, formerly romanized as Yangtzepoo or Yangtszepoo, is Chinese for &quot;poplar bank&quot; and refers to the creek () running through the area beside present-day Lanzhou Rd (formerly Lay Road) from the Qiu River in the north to the Huangpu River in the south. Yangshupu District was established in 1945, but the Shanghai Municipal Government contracted the name to Yangpu in 1950.

==History==
As with most of modern Shanghai, the territory of Yangpu has been formed by sediments deposited by the Yangtze River over many centuries. It was probably in the shallows of the East China Sea as late as the Tang dynasty. During the Northern Song, the Wuyu River () entered the sea somewhere around modern Wujiaochang (). Daoist and Buddhist temples are known to have been established in the vicinity around this time. In 1404, the Huangpu River shifted to its present course, entering the Yangtze River around Wusong. Toward the end of the Ming dynasty, villages along the river flourished, engaging in agriculture, banking, textiles and water-borne trade.

In 1842, the Treaty of Nanking opened Shanghai as a treaty port, and in 1863, part of present-day Yangpu District was included in the Shanghai Concession. Beginning in the 1880s, the area of contemporary Yangpu District began industrializing, with the Shanghai Machinery and Papermaking Office () opening in 1882, and the Yangshupu Waterworks opening in 1883. In 1890, the Shanghai Machine Weaving Office (), one of China&#x27;s first modern textile weaving factories, was established. In 1899, of what is now the south of modern Yangpu District was partitioned to become part of the International Settlement. Additional factories were constructed soon after in the area, especially along Yangshupu Road. Textile, paper-making, and shipbuilding industries were established by the early 20th century in what was then organized as part of Hongkew (now Hongkou). By the early 1920s, journalist turned revolutionary Chen Duxiu remarked in the New Youth magazine that the area of Yangshupu had become industrialized. By 1927, the area hosted 57 foreign factories, and a thriving textile industry. In 1929, the Wujiaochang farmers&#x27; market (&quot;Pentagon Plaza&quot;) was constructed in the north. Later, during the Japanese occupation from 1937 to 1945, barracks and houses were built in the area. The inland part of the former International Settlement in the area made up part of the Shanghai Ghetto. In December 1944, Yangshupu District was established with an area of .

Following the Communist conquest of Shanghai in 1949, the area was developed. Yangpu District&#x27;s boundaries expanded in 1956, 1960, and 1984. The area was especially used for heavy industries. The district&#x27;s present territory west of the river was formed after the incorporation of Wujiaochang District from Baoshan County in 1984. In 1992, Yangpu&#x27;s territories south of the Huangpu River were designated part of the Pudong New District.

== Education ==

A number of prominent universities are situated in Yangpu District, such as Fudan University, Tongji University, the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, the Shanghai University of Electric Power, the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Second Military Medical University, the Shanghai University of Sport, and Shanghai Ocean University.

Both the Lycée Français de Shanghai and German School Shanghai share a &quot;Eurocampus&quot; in Yangpu District, which opened in 2019.

== Economy ==
Since the beginning of the 21st century, Yangpu District has increasingly developed away from labor-intensive industry towards commerce and high technology: the area around Wujiaochang now boast ten large commercial centers and the research and development zone on Dalian Road hosts the regional headquarters of Siemens and Continental AG.

==Subdistricts==
As of 2020, Yangpu District administers 12 subdistricts.
==Transportation==

Yangpu District is connected to the neighbouring Pudong New Area across the Huangpu River by one bridge, three tunnels, and six ferry lines. These include the Yangpu Bridge, the , the , and the . A fourth tunnel, the Yinhang Road Tunnel is currently under construction.

The Inner Ring Road and Middle Ring Road traverse through Yangpu District.

The industrial wharves along the Huangpu River which service the industrial centres of Yangpu are being phased out by residential developments on the waterfront. Yangpu District has 15.5 kilometers of bank along Huangpu River, which is the longest among all districts in Puxi. As of July 2019, 5.5 kilometers of jogging and cycling lane has been built along the bank.

===Metro===
Yangpu is currently served by five metro lines operated by Shanghai Metro: Line 4, Line 8, Line 10, Line 12 and Line 18.

<text>Hsu Hsin-liang (; born 27 May 1941) is a Taiwanese politician, formerly Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). He was a supporter of the Pan-Blue Coalition from 2000 to 2008 but then supported the DPP in the 2008 presidential election.

==Early life and education==
Hsu was born in Chūreki, Shinchiku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan (modern-day Zhongli, Taoyuan, Taiwan). He attended Hsinchu Senior High School and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from National Chengchi University in 1967 and his Kuomintang-sponsored master&#x27;s degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1969.

==Political career==
Hsu began his political career in the Kuomintang as a member of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly from 1973 to 1977. He was expelled from the Kuomintang but broke ranks in 1977 when he ran and won as an independent in the election for Magistrate of Taoyuan County. The Zhongli incident took place during the election after voters reported seeing a Kuomintang official destroy cast ballots.

Hsu was involved in opposition activity during the first part of 1979. The government impeached him and removed him from office for two years. On September 30, 1979, he was exiled from Taiwan and moved to the United States where he maintained his position opposing the Kuomintang government.

In 1986, soon after the founding of the Democratic Progressive Party, he tried to return to Taiwan via Japan, but was repeatedly blocked at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Three years later he was arrested while slipping into Taiwan aboard a mainland Chinese fishing boat and was jailed for sedition until president Lee Teng-hui pardoned him in 1990.

He later joined the DPP and served as its chairman twice, from 1991 to 1993 and 1996 to 1998. He attempted to transform the party from a radical pro-Taiwan independence party to a more moderate and electable political group that no longer supported immediate independence. Having failed twice in gaining DPP support for his presidential bid, first in 1996 when he lost the party primary to Peng Ming-min and second in 1999 when the party threw its support behind the widely popular former mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian, Hsu chose to leave the DPP in 1999.

Hsu then ran in the 2000 presidential election as an independent with New Party legislator Josephine Chu as his running mate. During the campaign, he promoted unification based on &quot;one country, two systems&quot;. After the election, Hsu became more critical of the Chen Shui-bian government and its various policies. Hsu believes that maintaining a good relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China is vital for Taiwan&#x27;s survival and growth, and there is no hurry to negotiate with mainland on political issues at the present. Instead, establishing a closer economic relationship across the strait will help Taiwan&#x27;s economy.

Hsu publicly supported Lien Chen and James Soong in the 2004 presidential election. In March 2004, Hsu and a dozen other prominent politicians involved in the Tangwai movement published &quot;The Joint Declaration of the Tang Wai participants&quot; (黨外人士聯合聲明, the joint declaration of the participants outside of the political party movement), in which they reprimanded Chen Shui-bian for betraying the ideals of democracy and freedom that they once pursued. Criticising Chen for being &quot;corrupted by power&quot; and close with Lee Teng-hui and black gold, Hsu and others urged voters who once supported DPP for its ideals not to vote for Chen, to give him a chance to &quot;reflect on himself&quot;.

After the 2004 presidential election, Hsu, in protest of what he saw as an unfair election, arrived at Ketagalan Boulevard (in front of the presidential palace) on the night of March 24 and staged a three-day hunger strike. He believed firmly that Chen Shui-bian cheated in the election and thought he was now fighting for democracy, just as he did two decades ago.

In July 2004, he founded the Taiwan Democratic School, which is aimed at &quot;promoting a new democratic movement to sustain Taiwan&#x27;s young democracy.&quot; It has advocated unity within the Pan-Blue Alliance.

In December 2004 he made an unsuccessful run in the Legislative Yuan election as an independent in the Taipei City South constituency. His platform opposed a NT$610.8 billion arms purchase from the U.S. and supported opening three direct links. Until 2006, Hsu and another two former chairman of DPP, Shih and Lin, also left DPP due to dissatisfaction with Chen&#x27;s policies and corruptions.

However, after the KMT won a two-thirds majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan in 2008, Hsu became concerned about the party reverting to authoritarianism. Hsu then came out to support DPP candidate Frank Hsieh in the 2008 presidential election even though he had been connected with the pan-blue coalition camp during much of the period Chen Shui-bian served as president. After Chen left the office, Hsu backed the DPP. He has also been seen at events organized by the DPP since 2008. On March 25, 2011, he registered to participate in the DPP&#x27;s primary to select the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2012 presidential election. In April 2012, Hsu was nominated as a candidate for the DPP chairperson election to be held in May 2012, but lost.

==Cross-strait relations==
In mid-April 2013 during a press conference, Hsu called for a cross-strait political dialogue to rejuvenate the stagnant economy of Taiwan and for Taiwan to have a grand coalition government, adding that political dialogue with Beijing is not for political purpose, but rather to save the economy of Taiwan.

<doc id="506050" wikidata="Q7261588" url="?curid=506050" title="Pursuit of Nazi collaborators">
<text>The pursuit of Nazi collaborators refers to the post-World War II pursuit and apprehension of individuals who were not citizens of the Third Reich at the outbreak of World War II but collaborated with the Nazi regime during the war. Hence, this article does not cover former members of the NSDAP and their fates after the war.

== Background ==
There were a number of motives for the apprehension of suspected collaborators. The main motives were: revenge for those murdered, especially those murdered on ethnic grounds in the Holocaust (principally among Jews, Poles, and Russians); a desire after the war to see those responsible face justice, and be categorised as criminals by a court of law (See Nuremberg Trials); a means of ensuring that criminal acts done were brought to light and placed on the official record, with evidence, so that they could never be disproven (some of the acts being so unthinkable that denial was plausible); widespread sense that genocide of whole communities and cultures on such a scale was intolerable and must not be left unprosecuted even despite the inadequacy of existing laws; and fear that a &quot;Nazi underground&quot; of some kind existed, such as the mythical ODESSA, which could allow the enemy to somehow regroup for their proclaimed Fourth Reich. 

== Means of pursuit ==
The pursuit took many forms, both individual and organised. Several organisations and individuals (famous Nazi hunters) pursued ex-Nazis or Nazi collaborators who allegedly engaged in war crimes or crimes against humanity. Individuals reported seeing someone they recognised, now living under a false identity. Specific individuals were named and sought by groups or governments for their crimes during the war.

Others were subject to after-war spontaneous retaliation in occupied countries, which in some areas led to &quot;witch hunts&quot; for those suspected of having been collaborators, in which vigilantism and summary justice were common. After a first period of spontaneous pursuit, provisional governments took the matter into their own hands and brought suspected criminals to court. The Nuremberg Trial in Germany judged only the highest German Nazi authorities, and each country prosecuted and sentenced their own collaborationists. Pierre Laval in France was judged and sentenced to death, while Philippe Pétain was also sentenced to death, but Charles de Gaulle later commuted that to a life sentence. Governments investigated and interrogated people suspected of collaboration, for example the U.S. DOJ Office of Special Investigations.

Nazi support and escape organisations were infiltrated; the most famous was the ODESSA network, its various &quot;ratlines&quot; and those believed to have aided and abetted them. However, many suspected war criminals were also given amnesty, and some reached high positions in post-war administrations (e.g. Maurice Papon, who became Police Prefect of Paris in charge during the Algerian War (1954–62); he was blamed for the 1961 Paris massacre). Others were never even tried, such as Robert de Foy who resumed his position as head of the Belgian State Security Service 1945–1958.

== Pursuit in specific countries ==
=== Argentina ===
In March 1998, Ustasha Dinko Šakić, the former commandant of Jasenovac concentration camp (nicknamed the &quot;Auschwitz of the Balkans&quot;), was interviewed on national television in Argentina, where he had lived for over 50 years. During the interview, he admitted to his leadership position, but denied killing anyone. The interview caused a public uproar. In May 1998, Šakić was arrested by Argentine police. The following month, he was extradited to Croatia. In 1999, a Zagreb court sentenced him to 20 years in prison for his crimes. Šakić died in prison in 2008.

=== Australia ===
Latvia applied to Australia to extradite Konrāds Kalējs, allegedly a senior officer in the pro-Nazi Arajs Commando, but he died on 8 November 2001 before he could be extradited. Kalējs migrated to Australia in 1950 and took citizenship. Hungary applied for the extradition of Charles Zentai from Australia. He was accused of the murder of Peter Balazs, an 18-year-old Jewish man, in Budapest in November 1944, while serving in the Hungarian Army.

=== Belgium ===
Belgium imprisoned Belgian nationals who had collaborated with the Nazis and executed some. One Belgian to be sentenced to execution was Pierre Daye; however, he was one of the first Nazi collaborators to escape Europe, and unusually by plane. He fled to Argentina with the help of Charles Lescat, also collaborator of &quot;Je suis partout&quot;. Once in Argentina he attended a meeting organised by Juan Perón in the &quot;Casa Rosada&quot; during which a network (colloquially called ratlines) was created, to organise the escape of collaborators and former Nazis. On 17 June 1947, Belgium requested his extradition from Argentina; however, the Argentine Government ignored this request. Now secure in his freedom, Pierre Daye resumed his writing activities, becoming the editor of an official Perónist review.

Henri de Man was one of the leading Belgian socialist theoreticians of his period, who collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. After the liberation of Belgium, he crossed the border to Switzerland. He was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; of treason after the war. He died on 20 June 1953, together with his wife, in a collision with a train in Murten, Switzerland.

Albert Luykx fled to the Republic of Ireland in 1948 and became an Irish citizen in 1954.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
Actions against Nazi collaborators in Czechoslovakia, real or alleged, had two significant forms, by judiciary or by mob action. Immediately after the liberation of Czechoslovakia by Soviet and American armies, in an atmosphere of chaos, wild chases began. Individual acts of revenge, mob violence, and simply criminal acts motivated by the possibility to rob or loot targets, occurred. In some places were conducted, by organised groups of self-styled partisans, violence which resembled what is today known as ethnic cleansing. In most places this stopped when the provisional Czech government and local authorities took power. Other forms included legal action, undertaken by the state administration, after the war, until the regular Czech parliament was established. President Beneš ruled by issuing , which were later ratified by parliament.

By decree &quot;5/1945&quot;, property of untrustworthy persons was put under national administration. Untrustworthy were considered German and Hungarian nationals, and people who were active in destruction of the Czechoslovak state and its democratic government, supported Nazi occupation by any means, or were members of organisations considered fascist or collaborator. By the same decree, property of people of German and Hungarian nationality, who could prove they were anti-Nazi, could be returned to them.

By decree &quot;12/1945 Sb.&quot;, farm property of German and Hungarian nationals or citizens was confiscated, unless they could prove active resistance against Nazism. Property of &quot;traitors, and enemies of the republic&quot; was confiscated, regardless of nationality or citizenship. By decree &quot;16/1945 Sb.&quot;, special tribunals were started. These people&#x27;s courts had right to sentence to long term imprisonment, life sentence or death. Prosecutions varied from verbal support to those who had committed crimes against humanity, no prosecution was based on ethnicity. By &quot;33/1945 Sb.&quot; people of German and Hungarian nationality or ethnicity lost their Czechoslovakian citizenship. However, they had right to apply for renewal.

Most problematic was the law &quot;115/1946&quot;, concerning resistance to the Nazi regime, which shifted limit of immunity to the year 1946, effectively amnestying all crimes, acts of individual revenge and atrocities against Germans and Hungarians long after the war.

People who lost Czechoslovakian citizenship and failed to apply or did not get it were transferred to Germany, many through the transfer camp established at Terezín, near the Theresienstadt concentration camp.

=== Estonia ===
In the Estonian war crimes trials of 1961 and 1962, several collaborators were sentenced for participation in the Estonian holocaust. Many of the accused escaped punishment by escaping into exile or by suicide. The infamous Karl Linnas, who had been sentenced to death in absentia, was finally deported by the United States in 1987, and died in a prison hospital shortly after.

=== France ===

After the liberation, France was briefly swept by a wave of executions of suspected collaborators. At least some of the women suspected of having romantic liaisons with Germans were publicly humiliated by having their heads shaved. Those who had engaged in the black market were also stigmatised as &quot;war profiteers&quot; (&quot;profiteurs de guerre&quot;). However, the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF, 1944–46) quickly reestablished order and brought collaborators before the courts. Many of the convicted were later granted amnesty under the Fourth Republic (1946–1954), while some prominent civil servants, such as Maurice Papon, escaped prosecution altogether and succeeded in holding important positions even under Charles de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic (1958 and afterward).

Between 1944 and 1951, official courts in France sentenced 6,763 people to death (3,910 in absentia) for treason and other offences, and 791 executions were actually carried out. More common was &quot;national degradation,&quot; a loss of face and civil rights, which was meted out to 49,723 people.

Philippe Pétain, the former head of Vichy France, was charged with treason in July 1945. He was convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad, but Charles de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Pierre Laval was however, executed after his trial. Most convicted people were given amnesty a few years later. In the police, collaborators often resumed official responsibilities. For example, Maurice Papon, who would be convicted in the 1990s for his role in the Vichy collaborationist government, was in the position of giving orders for the Paris massacre of 1961 as the head of the Parisian police.

The French members of the Waffen-SS &quot;Charlemagne&quot; Division who survived the war were regarded as traitors. Some of the more prominent officers were executed, while the rank-and-file were given prison terms; some of them were given the option of serving time in Indochina (1946–54) with the Foreign Legion instead of prison.

Many war criminals were judged only in the 1980s, including Paul Touvier, Klaus Barbie, Maurice Papon and his deputy Jean Leguay. The last two were both convicted for their roles in the July 1942 &quot;Rafle du Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv&quot;, or Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup. Famous Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld spent decades trying to bring them to justice. A fair number of collaborationists joined the OAS terrorist movement during the Algerian War (1954–62). Jacques de Bernonville escaped to Quebec, then Brazil. Jacques Ploncard d&#x27;Assac became a counselor of Salazar in Portugal.

Reliable statistics of the death toll do not exist. At the low end, one estimate is that approximately 10,500 were executed, before and after liberation. &quot;The courts of Justice pronounced about 6,760 death sentences, 3,910 in absentia and 2,853 in the presence of the accused. Of these 2,853, 73 percent were commuted by de Gaulle, and 767 carried out. In addition, about 770 executions were ordered by the military tribunals. Thus the total number of people executed before and after the Liberation was approximately 10,500, including those killed in the épuration sauvage&quot;, notably including members and leaders of the milices. US forces put the number of &quot;summary executions&quot; following liberation at 80,000. The French Minister of the Interior at the time, March 1945, reported that the number executed was 105,000. Modern scholarship estimates a total number of summary executions between 10,000 and 15,000.

=== Greece ===
Greece was under the control of the Third Reich from 1941 to 1944. After the liberation, the country followed a controversial period of denazification. Many collaborators and especially former leaders of the Nazi-held puppet regime in Athens were sentenced to death. General Georgios Tsolakoglou, the first collaborationist prime minister, was tried by the Greek Special Collaborators Court in 1945 and sentenced to death, but his penalty, like most death sentences, was commuted to life imprisonment. The second collaborationist leader, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos, who had fled to Germany after the Wehrmacht&#x27;s withdrawal, was caught by the US military and was condemned to life imprisonment. In 1951, he was given parole and thus died outside prison. Ioannis Rallis, the third collaborationist prime minister, was tried on a treason charge; the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. However, several lower and middle figures that had collaborated with the Germans, especially members of the Security Battalions and the gendarmerie, were soon released and reinstated in their posts; in the developing Greek Civil War, their anti-Communist credentials were more important than their collaboration. Indeed, in many cases the same people who had collaborated with the Germans and staffed the post-war security establishment persecuted leftist former Resistance members.

Furthermore, during 1945, a Special Court on Collaborators in Ioannina condemned, in absentia, 1,930 Cham collaborators of the Axis to death (decision no. 344/1945). The next year the same court condemned an additional 179. However, the war crimes remained unpunished since the criminals had already fled abroad.

=== Israel ===

Israel enacted the Nazis and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law on 1 August 1950. Between 1950 and 1961, this law was used to prosecute around 40 Jewish Kapos proven to have been Nazi collaborators. In 1988, John Demjanjuk was sentenced to death as well, but the guilty verdict was later overturned by the Supreme Court on 29 July 1993.

On 23 February 1965, Latvian aviator and Nazi collaborator Herberts Cukurs was assassinated by the Mossad, the Israeli foreign intelligence service, after being lured to Uruguay under the pretense of starting an aviation business.

=== Norway ===
Vidkun Quisling, the war time Norwegian &quot;Minister President&quot;, and, among others, Nasjonal Samling leaders Albert Viljam Hagelin and Ragnar Skancke, were convicted and executed by firing squad. A total of 45 people were sentenced to death and 37 were executed (25 Norwegians and 12 Germans). Both at the time and later these sentences were the subject of some debate, since the decision to reintroduce capital punishment to the Norwegian legal system for the post war trials was based on clauses in military law. Capital punishment in the Criminal Code had been abolished in 1904. The decision was made by the exiled Norwegian government in London in 1944, later to be debated three times in the Parliament during the trials, and to be confirmed by the Supreme Court.

=== Poland ===
In occupied Poland the status of &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; had many privileges but one big disadvantage: &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; were conscripted into the German Army. The Volksliste had 4 categories. No. 1 and No. 2 were considered ethnic Germans, while No. 3 and No. 4 were ethnic Poles that signed the &quot;Volksliste&quot;. No. 1 and No. 2 in the Polish areas re-annexed by Germany numbered ~1,000,000 and No. 3 and No. 4 ~1,700,000. In the General Government there were ~120,000 Volksdeutsche.

After the war, Volksdeutsche of Polish origins were treated by Poles with special contempt, and also considered traitors according to Polish law. German citizens that remained on territory of Poland became as a group &quot;personae non gratae&quot;. They had a choice of applying for Polish citizenship or being expelled to Germany. The property that belonged to Germans, German companies and German states, was confiscated by the Polish state along with many other properties in Communist Poland.

German owners, as explicitly stated by the law, were not eligible for any compensation. Those who decided to apply became subject to a verification process. At the beginning of the process, many acts of violence against Volksdeutsche took place. However, soon the verification of Volksdeutsche became controlled by the juridical process and was completed in a more controlled manner.

=== Soviet Union ===

Russian and other Soviet members of the Russian Liberation Army and the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, such as Andrey Vlasov, were pursued, tried, and were either sent to Gulag prison camps or executed.

Many Soviet prisoners of war were seen to have collaborated with the Nazis, even if they had done no more than been captured by the Wehrmacht, and spent the war in a camp. Many such unfortunate Soviet citizens were persecuted upon their repatriation to the Soviet Union. In general, after a short trial, if they were not executed, Nazi collaborators were imprisoned in Gulag forced labour camps.

The Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was abolished and Volga Germans were banished from their settlements on the Volga River with many being deported to Kazakhstan or Siberia.

=== United Kingdom ===
At the end of the war a number of individuals were tried by the British government for high treason. These included members of the Waffen-SS British Free Corps and William Joyce, better known as Lord Haw-Haw. As agreed at the Yalta Conference, the British handed back many Soviet citizens to the Soviet authorities for trial. Some of these were collaborators who had served in the pro-Nazi Russian Liberation Army. A controversy would emerge years later, as some of those handed over were White Russians and Cossacks who had never been Soviet citizens, and who were subsequently murdered by the Soviet authorities. Yugoslav collaborators were handed over to Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s forces in the Bleiburg repatriations, with many being imprisoned while some killed as a result.

Viktors Arājs, who was the leader of the eponymous commando unit which helped the Nazis murder the Jews of Latvia and Belarus, had been captured in the British zone of occupied Germany after the war, and was released in 1949 after spending several years in a prisoner-of-war camp, the British being ignorant to his true identity. He remained at large until 1979 when the West German government put him on trial. One of Arajs&#x27;s deputies, Harijs Svikeris, settled in Britain after the war and in the 1990s was thought to be a strong candidate to be prosecuted under the War Crimes Act, but he died before being prosecuted.

In 1961 Ain-Ervin Mere was put on trial in the Soviet Union for his role in the murder of 5,000 foreign Jews in Estonia, but the request for extradition was refused by the British government, claiming that the Soviet government had insufficient evidence. On 1 April 1999, Anthony Sawoniuk was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of murdering 18 Jews in Britain&#x27;s first Nazi war crimes trial. Sawoniuk had led &quot;search-and-kill&quot; police squads to hunt down Jews trying to escape after nearly 3,000 were massacred at Domachevo in Nazi-occupied Belarus during September 1942. He died in prison on 7 November 2005 at the age of 84.

=== Yugoslavia ===
The reprisals for collaboration with the Nazis were particularly harsh in Yugoslavia, because collaborators were also on the losing side of a &quot;de facto&quot; civil war fought on the Yugoslav territory during the war. The Communists executed many Ustashe, as well as their collaborators, particularly in the Bleiburg death marches.

After the war, the UDBA, Yugoslavia&#x27;s secret police, was sent overseas to find and eliminate several former Ustashe who fled the country, including the leader of the Ustashe and their pro-Nazi government, Ante Pavelić. They conducted a successful assassination of Vjekoslav Luburić and others, and the extradition of Zdenko Blažeković, Andrija Artuković, and others.

<doc id="506052" wikidata="Q158025" url="?curid=506052" title="Thutmose II">
<text>Thutmose II was the fourth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, and his reign is thought to have lasted for 13 years, from 1493 to 1479 BC (Low Chronology), or just 3 years from around 1482 to 1479 BC. Little is known about him, and he is overshadowed by his father Thutmose I, half-sister and wife Hatshepsut, and son Thutmose III. There are relatively few monuments that refer to Thutmose II. 

He died before the age of 30 and a body claimed to be his was found in the Deir el-Bahari Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. His tomb, in the Western Wadis near the Valley of the Queens, was found in 2022 and confirmed to be his in 2025. The tomb was built under waterfalls, leading to periodic flooding which damaged the tomb throughout the ages. His mummified body was moved in ancient times and its final location is disputed.

==Family==

The name Thutmose II is read as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis II, Thothmes in older history works in Latinized Greek, and derives from Ancient Egyptian: /&quot;ḏḥwty.ms&quot;/ Djehutymes, meaning &quot;Thoth is born&quot;.

Thutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and his minor wife, Mutnofret, who was probably a daughter of Ahmose I. He was, therefore, a lesser son of Thutmose I and chose to marry his fully royal half-sister, Hatshepsut, in order to secure his kingship. Because Mutnofret was a princess and Thutmose I was common born, they most likely married only after Thutmose became king, hence their son would be born after his father&#x27;s coronation, and probably after his half-sister Hatshepsut, who was the pharaoh&#x27;s daughter by his primary wife. That would mean Thutmose II was in his early teens when he became pharaoh himself. While he successfully put down rebellions in Nubia and the Levant and defeated a group of nomadic Bedouins, these campaigns were specifically carried out by the king&#x27;s generals, and not by Thutmose II himself. This is often interpreted as evidence that Thutmose II was still a minor at his accession.

Thutmose II fathered Neferure with Hatshepsut, and Thutmose III, by a lesser wife named Iset.

Some archaeologists believe that Hatshepsut was the real power behind the throne during Thutmose II&#x27;s rule because of the similar domestic and foreign policies that were later pursued under her reign and because of her claim that she was her father&#x27;s intended heir. She is depicted in several raised relief scenes from a Karnak gateway dating to Thutmose II&#x27;s reign both together with her husband and alone. She later had herself crowned pharaoh several years into the rule of her husband&#x27;s young successor Thutmose III; this is confirmed by the fact that &quot;the queen&#x27;s agents actually replaced the king&#x27;s name in a few places with her own cartouches&quot; on the gateway.

If Thutmose II had indeed been born after his father&#x27;s coronation, he would either have been in his early teens (short reign) or early twenties (long reign) upon his death.

==Reign==
===Dates and length of reign===
The Epitome by Manetho refers to Thutmose II as &quot;Chebron&quot; and credits this ruler with a reign of 13 years. The Greek name may reflect a version of the prenomen, Aakheperenre. Egyptologists debate whether Thutmose II had a short or long reign. Some suggest a short reign of three years, based on his highest attested date is Year 1, II Akhet day 8 stele. There are only a small number of surviving documents, and a minimal amount of scarabs attested to this king.

It is still possible to estimate when Thutmose II&#x27;s reign would have begun by means of a heliacal rise of Sothis in Amenhotep I&#x27;s reign, which would give him a reign from 1493 to 1479 BC, although uncertainty about how to interpret the rise also permits a date from 1513 to 1499 BC, and uncertainty about how long Thutmose I ruled could also potentially place his reign several years earlier still. Nonetheless, scholars in the 20th century were assigning him a reign from 1493 or 1492 to 1479.

Alternatively, Thutmose could have ruled around two or three years, from 1482 to 1480/1479 BC.

====Argument for a short reign====

Ineni, who was already aged by the start of Thutmose II&#x27;s reign, lived through this ruler&#x27;s entire reign into that of Hatshepsut. In addition, Thutmose II is poorly attested in the monumental record and in the contemporary tomb autobiographies of New Kingdom officials. A clear count of monuments from his rule, which is the principal tool for estimating a king&#x27;s reign when dated documents are not available, is nearly impossible because Hatshepsut usurped most of his monuments, and Thutmose III in turn reinscribed Thutmose II&#x27;s name indiscriminately over other monuments. However, apart from several surviving blocks of buildings erected by the king at Semna, Kumma, and Elephantine, Thutmose II&#x27;s only major monument consists of a limestone gateway at Karnak that once lay at the front of the Fourth Pylon&#x27;s forecourt. Even this monument was not completed in Thutmose II&#x27;s reign but in the reign of his son Thutmose III, which hints at &quot;the nearly ephemeral nature of Thutmose II&#x27;s reign&quot;. The gateway was later dismantled and its building blocks incorporated into the foundation of the Third Pylon by Amenhotep III.

In 1987, Luc Gabolde published a study that statistically compared the number of surviving scarabs found under Thutmose I, Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. While monuments can be usurped, scarabs are so small and comparatively insignificant that altering their names would be impractical and without profit; hence, they provide a far better insight into this period. Hatshepsut&#x27;s reign is believed to have lasted for 21 years and 9 months. Gabolde highlighted, in his analysis, the consistently small number of surviving scarabs known for Thutmose II compared to Thutmose I and Hatshepsut respectively; for instance, Flinders Petrie&#x27;s older study of scarab seals noted 86 seals for Thutmose I, 19 seals for Thutmose II and 149 seals for Hatshepsut while more recent studies by Jaeger estimate a total of 241 seals for Thutmose I, 463 seals for Hatshepsut and only 65 seals for Thutmose II. Hence, unless there was an abnormally low number of scarabs produced under Thutmose II, this would indicate that the king&#x27;s reign was rather short-lived. On this basis, Gabolde estimated Thutmose I and II&#x27;s reigns to be approximately 11 and 3 full years, respectively.

Kara Cooney argues for short reign, no longer than 3 years, by judging that there were &quot;hardly any temples with his name on them, no campaigns, no mortuary complex of any worth&quot;, and points that all known children of Thutmose II were toddlers at the time of his death, which suggests his untimely death before they could grow up. 

Consequently, the reign length of Thutmose II has been a much debated subject among Egyptologists with little consensus given the small number of surviving documents for his reign.

====Argument for a long reign====

Thutmose&#x27;s reign is still traditionally given as 13 or 14 years. Although Ineni&#x27;s autobiography can be interpreted to say that Thutmose reigned only a short time, it also calls Thutmose II a &quot;hawk in the nest&quot;, indicating that he was perhaps a child when he assumed the throne. Since he lived long enough to father two children—Neferure and Thutmose III—this suggests that he may have had a longer reign of 13 years in order to reach adulthood and start a family. The German Egyptologist J. Von Beckerath uses this line of argument to support the case of a 13-year reign for Thutmose II. Alan Gardiner noted that at one point a monument had been identified by Georges Daressy in 1900, dated to Thutmose&#x27;s 18th year, although its precise location has not been identified. This inscription is now usually attributed to Hatshepsut, who certainly did have an 18th year. Von Beckerath observes that a Year 18 date appears in a fragmentary inscription of an Egyptian official and notes that the date likely refers to Hatshepsut&#x27;s prenomen Maatkare, which had been altered from Aakheperenre Thutmose II, with the reference to the deceased Thutmose II being removed. There is also the curious fact that Hatshepsut celebrated her Sed Jubilee in her Year 16, which von Beckerath believes occurred 30 years after the death of Thutmose I, her father, who was the main source of her claim to power. This would create a gap of 13 to 14 years where Thutmose II&#x27;s reign would fit in between Hatshepsut and Thutmose I&#x27;s rule. Von Beckerath additionally stresses that Egyptologists have no conclusive criteria to statistically evaluate the reign length of Thutmose II based on the number of preserved objects from his reign.

Catherine Roerig has proposed that tomb KV20, generally believed to have been commissioned by Hatshepsut, was the original tomb of Thutmose II in the Valley of the Kings. If correct, this would be a major project on the part of Thutmose II, which required a construction period of several years and implies a long reign for this king. Secondly, new archaeological work by French Egyptologists at Karnak has produced evidence of a pylon and an opulent festival court of Thutmose II in front of the 4th pylon according to Luc Gabolde. Meanwhile, French Egyptologists at Karnak have also uncovered blocks from a chapel and a barque sanctuary constructed by Thutmose II there. Finally, Zygmunt Wysocki has proposed that the funerary temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari was originally begun as Thutmose II&#x27;s own mortuary temple. Thutmose III here later replaced depictions of Hatshepsut with those by Thutmose II in those parts of the temple that are proposed to have been executed by the latter king before Hatshepsut took over the temple following Thutmose II&#x27;s death. Thutmose II also contributed to the decoration of the temple of Khnum at Semna.

A reconsideration of this new archaeological evidence would remove several arguments usually advanced in support of a short reign: namely the absence of a tomb that can be assigned to Thutmose II (prior to 2025), the absence of a funerary temple and the lack of any major works undertaken by this pharaoh. Thutmose II&#x27;s Karnak building projects would also imply that his reign was closer to 13 years rather than just three years.

The rediscovery of Thutmose II&#x27;s tomb in 2022 and its subsequent confirmation in 2025, along with the adjudged size of his tomb, support the theory that Thutmose II reigned for 13 or 14 years.

===Military campaigns===
====The Nubian Rebellion====
In Year 1, the Coronation of Thutmose triggered Kush to rebel, as it had the habit of doing upon the transition of Egyptian kingship. The Nubian state had been completely subjugated by Thutmose I. Rebels from Khenthennofer rose up, and the Egyptian forces retreated into a fortress built by Thutmose I. On account of his relative youth at the time, Thutmose II dispatched an army into Nubia rather than leading it himself. He seems to have easily crushed this revolt with the aid of his father&#x27;s military generals. An account of the campaign is given by the historian Josephus who refers to it as the &quot;Ethiopic War&quot;.

Aswan Stela of Thutmose II summary: Kush started to conspire, making subjects of the Lord of the Two Lands (nb-tawy) to contemplate a revolt. Plundering took place behind the fortification lines built by Thutmose I to hold back revolts from the foreign lands of the tribesmen of Ta-Seti of Khent-hen-nefer. The chief (wr) to the north of Kush had started hostilities, together with two tribesmen of Ta-Seti who were the sons of the chief (wr) of Kush. The foreign lands were divided into five parts.
====The Shashu Rebellion====
In the Sinai, Thutmose II seems to have fought against the Shasu Bedouin in a campaign mentioned by Ahmose Pen-Nekhbet. This campaign has been called a minor raid by some scholars.

There is a fragment recorded by Kurt Sethe that records a campaign in Upper Retenu, or Syria, which appears to have reached as far as a place called Niy where Thutmose I hunted elephants after returning from crossing the Euphrates. This quite possibly indicates that the raid against the Shasu was only fought &quot;en route&quot; to Syria.

==Attestations==
There are relatively few monuments that refer to Thutmose II. One reason is that his wife and successor, Hatsheput, placed her name on monuments begun by Thutmose II. Another problem is that Thutmose III later reassigned monuments to Thutmose II.

=== Aswan Stela ===
At Aswan, the &quot;Aswan Stela&quot; is dated to Year 1, II Akhet 8 of Thutmose II. The monument is the highest dated attestation of the king. It records a rebellion in Upper Nubia.

=== Karnak, Gateway ===
At Karnak, Thutmose II started the construction of a limestone gateway in the forecourt in front of the Fourth Pylon at the Temple. The monument was not completed until Thutmose III. Under Amenhotep III, the gateway was dismantled and its building blocks became part of the foundation of the Third Pylon.

=== Deir el-Bahari, Stone Chest ===
Archaeologists from Warsaw University&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology led by Andrzej Niwiński have discovered a treasure chest and a wooden box dated 3,500 years back in the Egyptian site of Deir el-Bahari in March 2020. The stone chest consisted of several items and all of them covered with linen canvas. Three bundles of flax were found during the excavation. A goose skeleton was found inside one of them, sacrificed for religious purposes. The second one included goose eggs. It is believed that what the third bundle contained was an ibis egg which had a symbolic meaning for the ancient Egyptians. In addition, a little wooden trinket box was discovered inside the bundle, believed to contain the name Pharaoh Thutmose II. According to the Andrzej Niwiński, &quot;The chest itself is about 40 cm long, with a slight smaller height. It was perfectly camouflaged, looked like an ordinary stone block. Only after a closer look did it turn out to be a chest.&quot;

==Death==
===Burial===
Until 2025, a variety of locations had been proposed for the location of Thutmose II&#x27;s tomb. It was speculated that it may have originally been KV42, but the lack of royal funerary equipment suggests the tomb was never used for burial. In 2020, a team led by Polish archeologist Andrzej Niwiński proposed a location near the Temple of Thutmose III and Temple of Hatshepsut due to the discovery of a chest bearing Thutmose&#x27;s cartouche.

In 2022, a joint Anglo-Egyptian team led by the University of Cambridge&#x27;s McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities uncovered a new tomb in the Western Wadis, near the Valley of the Kings. The tomb, designated Wadi C-4, was likened by the excavators to KV5 due to both tombs being filled with rubble and debris from flash floods, and was believed to have been dedicated during the reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. While the king&#x27;s tomb was discovered in 2022, the king&#x27;s purported remains were found in the Royal Cache of Mummies at Deir el-Bahari (Theban Necropolis) in 1881.

In 2025, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced that the tomb Wadi C-4 was the tomb of Thutmose II. The tomb showed many features typical for a king&#x27;s burial, such as a blue-painted ceiling with yellow stars, the remains of an Amduat depicted on the walls and inscribed vessels bearing the king&#x27;s name and Hatshesput&#x27;s name as his great wife. Additionally, fragments of alabaster jars with the names of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut were found in the tomb which helped confirm ownership. The tomb is the first royal tomb discovered in the Valley of the Kings area since the Tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. The tomb was built under waterfalls, leading to periodic flash flooding which damaged the tomb throughout the ages. According to the Mohamed Abdel Badi, head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector: &quot;The tomb is situated in a poorly-chosen place beneath two waterfalls and at the bottom of a slope down which water would have (and did) pour in the much wetter weather of the 18th dynasty.&quot; Only a few years after he was buried there, the body was moved to another location.

===Mummy===

Thutmose II&#x27;s mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahari cache, revealed in 1881. He was interred along with other 18th and 19th dynasty leaders including Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX. It included a label that indicated it had been re-wrapped in the Twenty-first Dynasty. 

The mummy was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero on 1 July 1886. There is a strong familial resemblance to the mummy of Thutmose I, his likely father, as the mummy&#x27;s face and shape of the head are very similar. The body of Thutmose II suffered greatly at the hands of ancient tomb robbers, with his left arm broken off at the shoulder-joint, the forearm separated at the elbow joint, and his right arm chopped off below the elbow. His anterior abdominal wall and much of his chest had been hacked at, possibly by an axe. In addition, his right leg had been severed from his body. All of these injuries were sustained post-mortem, though the body also showed signs that Thutmose II did not have an easy life, as the following quote by Gaston Maspero attests:

James Harris and Fawzia Hussien (1991) conducted an X-ray survey on New Kingdom royal mummies and examined the mummified remains of Thutmose II. The results of the study determined that the mummy of Thutmose II had a craniofacial trait measurement that was common among Nubian populations.

His mummy has the inventory number CG 61066. In April 2021, his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade. The identity of the mummy has been questioned in recent times. The re-wrapping label appears to identify him as Thutmose II but it may have been modified from that of Thutmose I.

<text>The  (abbr. CWI; English: &quot;National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science&quot;) is a research centre in the field of mathematics and theoretical computer science. It is part of the institutes organization of the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and is located at the Amsterdam Science Park. This institute is famous as the creation site of the programming language Python. It was a founding member of the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM).

==Early history==
The institute was founded in 1946 by Johannes van der Corput, David van Dantzig, Jurjen Koksma, Hendrik Anthony Kramers, Marcel Minnaert and Jan Arnoldus Schouten. It was originally called &quot;Mathematical Centre&quot; (in Dutch: &quot;Mathematisch Centrum&quot;). One early mission was to develop mathematical prediction models to assist large Dutch engineering projects, such as the Delta Works. During this early period, the Mathematics Institute also helped with designing the wings of the Fokker F27 Friendship airplane, voted in 2006 as the most beautiful Dutch design of the 20th century.

The computer science component developed soon after. Adriaan van Wijngaarden, considered the founder of computer science (or &quot;informatica&quot;) in the Netherlands, was the director of the institute for almost 20 years. Edsger Dijkstra did most of his early influential work on algorithms and formal methods at CWI. The first Dutch computers, the Electrologica X1 and Electrologica X8, were both designed at the centre, and Electrologica was created as a spinoff to manufacture the machines.

In 1983, the name of the institute was changed to Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI) to reflect a governmental push for emphasizing computer science research in the Netherlands.

==Recent research==
The institute is known for its work in fields such as operations research, software engineering, information processing, and mathematical applications in life sciences and logistics.
More recent examples of research results from CWI include the development of scheduling algorithms for the Dutch railway system (the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, one of the busiest rail networks in the world) and the development of the Python programming language by Guido van Rossum. Python has played an important role in the development of the Google search platform from the beginning, and it continues to do so as the system grows and evolves. 
Many information retrieval techniques used by packages such as SPSS were initially developed by Data Distilleries, a CWI spinoff.

Work at the institute was recognized by national or international research awards, such as the Lanchester Prize (awarded yearly by INFORMS), the Gödel Prize (awarded by ACM SIGACT) and the Spinoza Prize. Most of its senior researchers hold part-time professorships at other Dutch universities, with the institute producing over 170 full professors during the course of its history. Several CWI researchers have been recognized as members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Academia Europaea, or as knights in the Order of the Netherlands Lion.

In February 2017, CWI in association with Google announced a successful collision attack on SHA 1 encryption algorithm.

==European Internet==
CWI was an early user of the Internet in Europe, in the form of a TCP/IP connection to NSFNET. Piet Beertema at CWI established one of the first two connections outside the United States to the NSFNET (shortly after France&#x27;s INRIA) for EUnet on 17 November 1988. The first Dutch country code top-level domain issued was cwi.nl. When this domain cwi.nl was registered, on 1 May 1986, .nl effectively became the first active ccTLD outside the United States. For the first ten years CWI, or rather Beertema, managed the .nl administration, until in 1996 this task was transferred to its spin-off SIDN.

The Amsterdam Internet Exchange (one of the largest Internet Exchanges in the world, in terms of both members and throughput traffic) is located at the neighbouring SARA (an early CWI spin-off) and Nikhef institutes. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) office for the Benelux countries is located at CWI.

==Spin-off companies==
CWI has demonstrated a continuing effort to put the work of its researchers at the disposal of society, mainly by collaborating with commercial companies and creating spin-off businesses. In 2000 CWI established &quot;CWI Incubator BV&quot;, a dedicated company with the aim to generate high tech spin-off companies. Some of the CWI spinoffs include:
* 1956: Electrologica, a pioneering Dutch computer manufacturer.
* 1971: SARA (now called SURF), founded as a center for data processing activities for Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Universiteit van Amsterdam, and the CWI.
* 1990: DigiCash, an electronic money corporation founded by David Chaum.
* 1994: NLnet, an Internet Service Provider.
* 1994: General Design / Satama Amsterdam, a design company, acquired by LBi (then Lost Boys international).
* 1995: Data Distilleries, developer of analytical database software aimed at information retrieval, eventually becoming part of SPSS and acquired by IBM.
* 1996: Stichting Internet Domeinregistratie Nederland (SIDN), the .nl top-level domain registrar.
* 2000: Software Improvement Group (SIG), a software improvement and legacy code analysis company.
* 2008: MonetDB, a high-tech database technology company, developer of the MonetDB column-store.
* 2008: Vectorwise, an analytical database technology company, founded in cooperation with the Ingres Corporation (now Actian) and eventually acquired by it.
* 2010: Spinque, a company providing search technology for information retrieval specialists.
* 2013: MonetDB Solutions, a database services company.
* 2016: Seita, a technology company providing demand response services for the energy sector.
* 2021: DuckDB Labs, a data processing company offering support and consulting services for DuckDB (a column-oriented RDBMS, designed for high performance on complex queries against large databases in embedded configurations).

<doc id="506071" wikidata="Q270407" url="?curid=506071" title="Eureka Tower">
<text>Eureka Tower is a skyscraper located in the Southbank precinct of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Construction began in August 2002 and the exterior was completed on 1 June 2006. The plaza was finished in June 2006 and the building was officially opened on 11 October 2006. The project was designed by Melbourne architectural firm Fender Katsalidis Architects and was built by Grocon (Grollo Australia). The developer of the tower was Eureka Tower Pty Ltd, a joint venture consisting of Daniel Grollo (Grocon), investor Tab Fried and one of the Tower&#x27;s architects Nonda Katsalidis.

Construction began August 2002. The tower was officially opened on 11 October 2006. The building&#x27;s design is themed around the Eureka Stockade. It contains 556 apartments serviced by 13 lifts. Level 88 features an observation deck and level 89, a restaurant, cocktail bar and event space. The building is home to the annual Eureka Climb and a 2013 experiment involving airplants.

It was the world&#x27;s tallest residential tower when measured to its highest floor, until surpassed by Ocean Heights and the HHHR Tower in Dubai. From 2006 to 2020, it was the tallest building in Melbourne, until the topping out of Australia 108. It is currently the third tallest building in Australia, behind the Q1 in Queensland and Australia 108, as well as the second tallest to roof (excluding spire) behind the latter skyscraper. As of 2016 it was the 15th tallest residential building in the world.

==Design and features==
Eureka Tower is named after the Eureka Stockade, a rebellion during the Victorian gold rush in 1854. This has been incorporated into the design, with the building&#x27;s gold crown representing the gold rush and a red stripe representing the blood spilt during the revolt. The blue glass cladding that covers most of the building represents the blue background of the stockade&#x27;s flag and the white lines also represent the Eureka Stockade flag. The white horizontal stripes also represent markings on a surveyor&#x27;s measuring staff.

At the base of the tower is an art installation containing nine bees inside a white box, resembling a manmade beehive. There are two regular sized bees outside the box, and one queen bee on the top. The gold colour of the bees complements the gold at the top of the tower. The installation was created by Richard Stringer and Nonda Katsalidis, and was initially completed in December 2007. Other bees have since been added to the building, most recently in 2019.

When measured either by the height of its roof, or by the height of its highest habitable floor, Eureka Tower was the tallest residential building in the world when completed. It was also the building with the most floors available for residential occupancy in the world. The building stands in height, with 91 storeys above ground plus one basement level. At the time of its completion, it was one of the only buildings in the world with 90 or more storeys. It is also the third-tallest building in Australia and the second tallest building in Melbourne, behind Australia 108 which topped out in November 2019. The single level basement and first 9 floors contain car parking. The building&#x27;s proximity to the water table as well as the Yarra River made the construction of a basement car park uneconomical. In all, there are 84 floors of apartments (including some floors shared between car parking and apartments), with the remainder being used for building facilities and the observation deck.

According to the ranking system developed by the U.S.-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the Eureka Tower qualified as the tallest building in three of the four categories in which heights are ranked, namely height to the floor of the highest occupied floor of the building. For comparison, the Q1 apartment tower on the Gold Coast has its highest habitable floor (the observation deck), reaching a height of , some lower than Eureka Tower&#x27;s highest habitable floor. Q1&#x27;s highest penthouse apartment is whilst Eureka&#x27;s penthouse is high. However, the spire attached to the top of Q1 exceeds the Eureka Tower in the other two categories, namely &quot;Height to the tip of spire, pinnacle, antenna, mast or flag pole&quot; – in this case, spire – and height to architectural top of the building.

===Specifications===
* 556 apartments
* 13 lifts travelling up to 
* of windows
* 3,680 stairs
* of concrete
* of reinforced steel
* Building weighs 

Floors 82 to 87, marketed as &quot;Summit Levels&quot;, contain only one apartment per floor, each with an original price of A$7 million for the unfurnished floor space alone.

The highest floors of the tower house an observation deck (level 88), restaurant (level 89), communication rooms and balcony (90) and water tanks (90 and 91). A system of pumps constantly moves water between the two 300,000-litre tanks to counteract wind-induced oscillations.

== Observation deck (Melbourne Skydeck) ==
The observation deck (Melbourne Skydeck) occupies the entire 88th floor of the Eureka Tower and is the highest public vantage point in a building in the Southern Hemisphere at . It opened to the public on 15 May 2007. An entry fee applies to access the Skydeck.

The Skydeck features twenty viewfinders that help visitors to pinpoint numerous significant landmarks around all parts of Melbourne, along with several free binoculars. There is a small outside area called &quot;The Terrace&quot; which is closed in high winds. There is also a glass cube called &quot;The Edge&quot;, which extends itself 3 metres from the building to hang over the edge of the tower and add to the viewing experience.

On 10 January 2005, Grocon, the firm building Eureka Tower, proposed adding a communications mast/observation tower. The proposal is currently before the local planning commission. This mast would be a significant structure, used for providing an adventure climb to the tip of the summit.

On 16 April 2006, a new proposal was announced that the construction company and developers were considering options for the building to have a &quot;skywalk&quot; that would take daring people up high. The proposed structure may also include a communications tower.
===&quot;The Edge&quot;===
Skydeck 88 features &quot;The Edge&quot; – a glass cube which projects out from the building with visitors inside, suspended almost above the ground. When one enters, the glass is opaque as the cube moves out over the edge of the building. Once fully extended over the edge, the glass becomes clear.

== Eureka 89 Dining &amp; Events ==
Located on the top floor (level 89) of the Eureka Tower, Eureka 89 Dining &amp; Events is a restaurant, cocktail bar and event space offering a modern Australian menu by award winning chef Renee Martillano. Eureka 89&#x27;s location on the tower&#x27;s top floor makes it the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s highest restaurant &amp; bar at a staggering 292.3 m (959 ft) high.

== Construction ==

Construction began August 2002 and took 4 years and 2 months.

The tower was built using reinforced concrete using a slipform method. Eureka Tower&#x27;s lift core superseded the height of Rialto Towers on 9 November 2004.

On 23 May 2006, the crane on top of the tower was dismantled by a smaller crane, which was dismantled by a smaller crane that could be taken down the service elevator.

Eureka Tower has 24 carat (99.9%) gold plated glass windows on the top 10 floors of the building. Installation of the gold glass was completed in March 2006. Apartment owners and tenants had taken up residence in the building between Ground Level and Level 80 as of July 2006.

On 11 October 2006, the tower was officially opened by then Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks.

=== Construction methods ===
A 2-floor Grocon-Lubeca jumpform system was used to halve work time, concrete and joints required in the core, as well as increasing structural integrity.

Grocon purchased the Singapore company Lubeca in 2000, and then did more R&amp;D to design the 2-floor jumpform system.

==Eureka Climb==
Since 2012, the Eureka Climb event has been held annually. Participants climb 1642 steps to the observation deck. The current record is 7 minutes to climb up 88 floors.

===Air plant experiment===
From June 2013, a team of researchers placed &quot;Tillandsia&quot; airplants on four locations on the tower. Two different species were placed at four levels: 56, 65, 91, and on top at level 92. These plants grow with no soil or watering / nutrient system and on Eureka Tower were exposed to the elements where they proved to grow through winter, saw winds over and a hot dry summer. Not all plants survived. Those on eastern aspects died because of lack of rain. However, plants in the most exposed sites, facing west and on the open roof sites have survived and flourished. The plants have been regularly checked over a number of years (last check Dec 2021) and have grown into resilient colonies. As far as can be ascertained this is the highest building with plants on and the experiment paved the way for utilising &quot;Tillandsia&quot; on high-rise buildings.

<doc id="506072" wikidata="Q927539" url="?curid=506072" title="New York Heart Association Functional Classification">
<text>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a simple way of classifying the extent of heart failure. It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regard to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and/or angina.

It originated in 1928, when no measurements of cardiac function were possible, to provide a common language for physicians to communicate. Despite difficulties in applying it, such as the challenge of consistently classifying patients in class II or III, because functional capacity is such a powerful determinant of outcome, it remains arguably the most important prognostic marker in routine clinical use in heart failure today. With time the classification system evolved and updated multiple times. Presently, the ninth edition of the NYHA classification is being used in the clinical practice released in the year 1994 by the Criteria Committee of the American Heart Association, New York City Affiliate.

Another frequently used functional classification of cardiovascular disease is the Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading of angina pectoris.

<doc id="506077" wikidata="Q670653" url="?curid=506077" title="Marginal distribution">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, the marginal distribution of a subset of a collection of random variables is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset. It gives the probabilities of various values of the variables in the subset without reference to the values of the other variables. This contrasts with a conditional distribution, which gives the probabilities contingent upon the values of the other variables.

Marginal variables are those variables in the subset of variables being retained. These concepts are &quot;marginal&quot; because they can be found by summing values in a table along rows or columns, and writing the sum in the margins of the table. The distribution of the marginal variables (the marginal distribution) is obtained by marginalizing (that is, focusing on the sums in the margin) over the distribution of the variables being discarded, and the discarded variables are said to have been marginalized out.

The context here is that the theoretical studies being undertaken, or the data analysis being done, involves a wider set of random variables but that attention is being limited to a reduced number of those variables. In many applications, an analysis may start with a given collection of random variables, then first extend the set by defining new ones (such as the sum of the original random variables) and finally reduce the number by placing interest in the marginal distribution of a subset (such as the sum). Several different analyses may be done, each treating a different subset of variables as the marginal distribution.

== Definition ==
=== Marginal probability mass function ===
Given a known joint distribution of two discrete random variables, say, and , the marginal distribution of either variable – for example – is the probability distribution of when the values of are not taken into consideration. This can be calculated by summing the joint probability distribution over all values of . Naturally, the converse is also true: the marginal distribution can be obtained for by summing over the separate values of .

:formula_1, and formula_2
A marginal probability can always be written as an expected value:
formula_3

Intuitively, the marginal probability of &quot;X&quot; is computed by examining the conditional probability of &quot;X&quot; given a particular value of &quot;Y&quot;, and then averaging this conditional probability over the distribution of all values of &quot;Y&quot;.

This follows from the definition of expected value (after applying the law of the unconscious statistician)
formula_4

Therefore, marginalization provides the rule for the transformation of the probability distribution of a random variable &quot;Y&quot; and another random variable :
formula_5

=== Marginal probability density function ===
Given two continuous random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; whose joint distribution is known, then the marginal probability density function can be obtained by integrating the joint probability distribution, , over &quot;Y,&quot; and vice versa. That is

:formula_6 
:formula_7

where formula_8, and formula_9.

=== Marginal cumulative distribution function ===
Finding the marginal cumulative distribution function from the joint cumulative distribution function is easy. Recall that:

* For discrete random variables, formula_10
* For continuous random variables, formula_11

If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; jointly take values on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] × [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] then

:formula_12 and formula_13

If &quot;d&quot; is ∞, then this becomes a limit formula_14. Likewise for formula_15.

== Marginal distribution vs. conditional distribution ==

=== Definition ===
The marginal probability is the probability of a single event occurring, independent of other events. A conditional probability, on the other hand, is the probability that an event occurs given that another specific event &quot;has already&quot; occurred. This means that the calculation for one variable is dependent on another variable.

The conditional distribution of a variable given another variable is the joint distribution of both variables divided by the marginal distribution of the other variable. That is,

* For discrete random variables,formula_16
* For continuous random variables,formula_17

=== Example ===
Suppose there is data from a classroom of 200 students on the amount of time studied (&quot;X&quot;) and the percentage of correct answers (&quot;Y&quot;). Assuming that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are discrete random variables, the joint distribution of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; can be described by listing all the possible values of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;xi&quot;,&quot;yj&quot;), as shown in Table.3.

The marginal distribution can be used to determine how many students scored 20 or below: , meaning 10 students or 5%.

The conditional distribution can be used to determine the probability that a student that studied 60 minutes or more obtains a scored of 20 or below: , meaning there is about a 11% probability of scoring 20 after having studied for at least 60 minutes.

==Real-world example==
Suppose that the probability that a pedestrian will be hit by a car, while crossing the road at a pedestrian crossing, without paying attention to the traffic light, is to be computed. Let H be a discrete random variable taking one value from {Hit, Not Hit}. Let L (for traffic light) be a discrete random variable taking one value from {Red, Yellow, Green}.

Realistically, H will be dependent on L. That is, P(H = Hit) will take different values depending on whether L is red, yellow or green (and likewise for P(H = Not Hit)). A person is, for example, far more likely to be hit by a car when trying to cross while the lights for perpendicular traffic are green than if they are red. In other words, for any given possible pair of values for H and L, one must consider the joint probability distribution of H and L to find the probability of that pair of events occurring together if the pedestrian ignores the state of the light.

However, in trying to calculate the marginal probability P(H = Hit), what is being sought is the probability that H = Hit in the situation in which the particular value of L is unknown and in which the pedestrian ignores the state of the light. In general, a pedestrian can be hit if the lights are red OR if the lights are yellow OR if the lights are green. So, the answer for the marginal probability can be found by summing P(H | L) for all possible values of L, with each value of L weighted by its probability of occurring.

Here is a table showing the conditional probabilities of being hit, depending on the state of the lights. (Note that the columns in this table must add up to 1 because the probability of being hit or not hit is 1 regardless of the state of the light.)

To find the joint probability distribution, more data is required. For example, suppose P(L = red) = 0.2, P(L = yellow) = 0.1, and P(L = green) = 0.7. Multiplying each column in the conditional distribution by the probability of that column occurring results in the joint probability distribution of H and L, given in the central 2×3 block of entries. (Note that the cells in this 2×3 block add up to 1).

The marginal probability P(H = Hit) is the sum 0.572 along the H = Hit row of this joint distribution table, as this is the probability of being hit when the lights are red OR yellow OR green. Similarly, the marginal probability that P(H = Not Hit) is the sum along the H = Not Hit row.

==Multivariate distributions==

For multivariate distributions, formulae similar to those above apply with the symbols &quot;X&quot; and/or &quot;Y&quot; being interpreted as vectors. In particular, each summation or integration would be over all variables except those contained in &quot;X&quot;.

That means, If &quot;X&quot;1,&quot;X&quot;2,…,&quot;Xn&quot; are discrete random variables, then the marginal probability mass function should be
formula_18
if &quot;X&quot;1,&quot;X&quot;2,…,&quot;Xn&quot; are continuous random variables, then the marginal probability density function should be
formula_19

<doc id="506080" wikidata="Q242868" url="?curid=506080" title="Jean Paul Gaultier">
<text>Jean Paul Gaultier (; born 24 June 1952) is a French haute couture and prêt-à-porter fashion designer.

He is described as an &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of the fashion industry and is known for his unconventional designs with motifs including corsets, marinières, and tin cans. Gaultier founded his eponymous fashion label in 1982, and expanded with a line of fragrances in 1993. He was the creative director for French luxury house Hermès from 2003 to 2010, and retired following his 50th-anniversary haute couture show during Paris Fashion Week in January 2020.

As a costume designer, Gaultier created Madonna&#x27;s cone bra for the 1990 Blond Ambition World, and the costumes for the movies &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (1995), &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997), &quot;Bad Education&quot; (2004) and The Skin I Live In(2011).

==Early life==
Gaultier grew up in a suburb of Paris. His mother was a clerk and his father an accountant. It was his maternal grandmother, Marie Garrabe, who introduced him to the world of fashion.

He never received formal training as a designer. Instead, he began to send sketches to famous couture stylists at an early age. Pierre Cardin was impressed by his talent and hired him as an assistant in 1970. Then he worked with Jacques Esterel in 1971 and Jean Patou later that year again worked for Cardin managing the Pierre Cardin boutique in Manila for a year until 1974. Despite Gaultier&#x27;s youth, Cardin sent him to Manila to manage the local office. Imelda Marcos was one of his clients. He found himself on a &quot;no leave&quot; list and had to pretend to have a family emergency in order to leave. He never returned.

==Career==
===Fashion career===
Gaultier&#x27;s first individual collection was released in 1976. Although most people found his designs decadent at the time, fashion editors, notably Melka Tréanton of &quot;Elle&quot;, Claude Brouet and Catherine Lardeur of French &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, were impressed by his creativity and mastery of tailoring, and later launched his career. In 1980, he designed women&#x27;s dresses out of plastic rubbish bags. Gaultier founded his eponymous fashion label in 1982. His 1983 collection &quot;Boy Toy&quot; relaunched the marinière for men. His garments were on sale at Bergdorf Goodman in New York as soon as 1984, and already lauded by Dawn Mello and Polly Allen Mellen. The term &quot;Gaultiered&quot; was coined to describe the classic pieces that were reinterpreted by the designer. During the 1984 Fall London and Paris shows, Jean Paul Gaultier introduced his line of skirts for men (actually kilts), a breakthrough in men&#x27;s fashion that stirred a bit of controversy. In 1984, he also introduced the iconic women&#x27;s corset with cone bra. Gaultier has also worked in close collaboration with Wolford Hosiery.

By 1985, his company made $50 million in sales worldwide. For the premiere of the 1985 movie &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, Madonna wore a skirt with men&#x27;s suspenders she had bought from Gaultier. Besides his ready-to-wear collection, in 1988 Gaultier expanded his brand to include the label Junior Gaultier, a lower-priced line of products. The Junior Gaultier outfit was selected by Jeff Banks as the Dress of the Year. In 1988, he also recorded the music video &quot;How to do that&quot;. At the end of the 1980s he invented a new look for the French accordionist Yvette Horner which relaunched her career. In 1989, he was tailoring a costume for Prince when the singer walked away, offended, thinking Gaultier had told him &quot;fuck you&quot; where the couturier with a heavy French accent had said &quot;faux cul&quot; (false bottom). In 1990, he designed Madonna&#x27;s clothes for her Blond Ambition World Tour.

At the end of the 1980s, Gaultier suffered some personal losses, and in 1990 his boyfriend and business partner, Francis Menuge, died of AIDS-related causes. It is also around that time that he decided to tone down his showmanship and started to plan more intimate events.

Gaultier launched a line of fragrances (Classique) in 1993. The Junior Gaultier label was replaced in 1994 with JPG by Gaultier, a unisex collection that followed the designer&#x27;s idea of fluidity of the sexes. Gaultier Jean&#x27;s, a similar line consisting mainly of denim and more simply styled garments with a heavy street influence, followed in 1992, which was then replaced with Jean&#x27;s Paul Gaultier from 2004 to 2008. Junior Gaultier&#x27;s name was reused in 2009 for the launching of the child&#x27;s wear, to be completed with a Baby Line in 2011.

In 1998, Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s company generated €12.9 million ($13.2 million) in sales. In 1999, Hermès acquired 35% of Gaultier&#x27;s label for 150 million francs ($23 million). Jean Paul Gaultier owned 93% of his company prior to this deal. In 2002, Gaultier&#x27;s label opened its first fully-fledged stand-alone store. Then, from 2003 to 2010, Gaultier was the creative director of Hermès where he succeeded Martin Margiela. Hermès later increased its stake in Jean Paul Gaultier to 45%. By 2008, 40 Jean Paul Gaultier stores opened worldwide.

He sponsored the 2003–04 exhibit in the Costume Institute of New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art entitled &quot;Braveheart: Men in Skirts&quot;, which showed designs by Dries van Noten, Vivienne Westwood, and Rudi Gernreich in addition to Gaultier&#x27;s in order to examine &quot;designers and individuals who have appropriated the skirt as a means of injecting novelty into male fashion, as a means of transgressing moral and social codes, and as a means of redefining an ideal masculinity.&quot; He also designed some furniture for the French furniture brand Roche Bobois and an Evian bottle in 2008. Gaultier&#x27;s spring 2009 couture was influenced by the visual style of singer Klaus Nomi, and he used Nomi&#x27;s recording of &quot;Cold Song&quot; in his runway show.

In 2011, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in collaboration with the Maison Jean Paul Gaultier organized a retrospective exhibit, &quot;The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier: From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk.&quot; That exhibit is on tour with venues at the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design (&quot;Arkitektur- och designcentrum&quot;, ArkDes) in Stockholm, the Brooklyn Museum in New York City, the Barbican Centre in London, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, and the Grand Palais in Paris. The exhibition in Paris, which took place from April to August 2015, was the subject of a documentary called &quot;Jean Paul Gaultier at the Grand Palais&quot; aired exclusively on Eurochannel. In 2012, he participated in the Cali ExpoShow in Cali (Colombia), showing his extensive collection of perfumes and all classic clothes.

Up until 2014, he designed for three collections: his own couture and ready-to-wear lines, for both men and women. At the spring/summer 2015 show he announced that he was closing the ready-to-wear labels to focus on haute couture. In 2016, he designed more than 500 costumes for the revue THE ONE Grand Show at Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin.

In 2018, he staged a cabaret show that was loosely based on his life called &quot;Fashion Freak Show&quot; which took place at the Folies Bergere theater in Paris. In 2019, Gaultier collaborated with the New York streetwear brand Supreme.

He announced on 17 January 2020 that his next Paris haute couture fashion show would be his last and that he was retiring from the runway.

=== Music and television ===

In 1988, Gaultier released a dance single titled &quot;How To Do That&quot; on Fontana Records, from which came one of the first ever &quot;single title&quot; remix albums, &quot;Aow Tou Dou Zat&quot;, on Mercury Records. The album includes mixes by Norman Cook, J. J. Jeczalik, George Shilling, Mark Saunders, Latin Rascals, David Dorrell, Tim Atkins, Carl Atkins, and Kurtis Mantronik. It was co-written and produced by Tony Mansfield, and video directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino. The album also featured a collaboration with accordion player Yvette Horner.

Gaultier is known as Eurovision enthusiast, and since 1991, he&#x27;s dressed several of France&#x27;s entrants. For the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, he dressed Greek entrant Anna Vissi, where she performed on homesoil. He commentated on the final of the 2008 contest with Julien Lepers on France Télévisions. He designed the dress that Anggun wore as she represented France during the grand-finals of the 2012 edition held in Baku, Azerbaijan. In Eurovision Song Contest 2013 he dressed the host Petra Mede.

Starting in 1993, he co-hosted the Channel 4 programme &quot;Eurotrash&quot; with Antoine de Caunes. Gaultier hosted the show until 1997.

In 2022, he appeared with Iris Mittenaere as a guest judge on &quot;Drag Race France&quot;.

==Products==


Jean Paul Gaultier fragrances have been licensed by Puig since 1 January 2016, and were previously licensed by Shiseido subsidiary Beauté Prestige International from 1991 through 31 December 2015. The BPI license was originally negotiated through 30 June 2016; however, Puig acquired the license for $79.2 million and paid $22.6 million for the early termination of the license. With this purchase, Puig now holds control of both the fashion and fragrance divisions of the Jean Paul Gaultier brand. The 1993 women&#x27;s oriental floral Classique and the 1995 men&#x27;s oriental fougere Le Male have been described by the brand as &quot;flagship&quot; products that &quot;represent all the Jean Paul Gaultier values&quot;. Le Male was the top-selling men&#x27;s fragrance in the European Union in 2012, and holds a strong market position in Australia and the United States.

, the Classique, Le Male, and Scandal lines are in production.

==Style==
Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s characteristic irreverent style dating from 1981 has led to his being known as the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of French fashion.

Many of Gaultier&#x27;s subsequent collections have been based on street wear, focusing on popular culture, whereas others, particularly his haute couture collections, are very formal, yet at the same time unusual and playful. Jean Paul Gaultier says he is inspired by the baby boomers&#x27; TV culture, and the street culture where audacity sometimes triggers new trends. His main inspirations are French popular culture, the mixing of types and genders, sexual fetishism and futurist designs.

The advent of his haute couture line brought him massive success in 1997. Through this collection, he was able to freely express the scope and range of his aesthetic, drawing inspiration from radically divergent cultures, from Imperial India to Hasidic Judaism.

Gaultier caused shock by using unconventional models for his exhibitions, like older men and fat women, pierced and heavily tattooed models, and by playing with traditional gender roles in the shows. This earned him both criticism and enormous popularity. The &quot;granny grey&quot; hair colour trend is attributed to Gaultier, whose autumn/winter 2011 show featured models in grey beehives. In the spring of 2015, his catwalk show at Paris Fashion Week featured silver-haired models again, as did the shows of other fashion designers, Chanel and Gareth Pugh. The trend soon took off among celebrities and the general public.

== Personal life ==
Gaultier had always had an interest in fashion. In school, he found himself at odds with his classmates; though he did not fit in, they nonetheless wanted him to do drawings for them.

Uneasy with his sexuality, he was reassured when he learnt that some of the iconic fashion designers were also gay or bisexual, as he wanted to work in fashion himself. He met his partner Francis Menuge, who helped him to get established and start running shows. Gaultier and Menuge both learned about AIDS during its advent, and both were tested. Menuge was HIV positive, and both Gaultier and Menuge&#x27;s parents looked after him until his death from AIDS.

<text>Australian indie rock is part of the overall flow of Australian rock history but has a distinct history somewhat separate from mainstream rock in Australia, largely from the end of the punk rock era onwards.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Rock and roll in Australia got started in the late 1950s and 1960s, influenced by the sounds coming from the United States and UK. Early on, the surf rock sound dominated, though in the mid-1960s, the beat genre from the UK had become established. Numerous garage bands formed in the cities and suburbs, and a vibrant musical culture began.

Isolated from the diversity of genres in the northern hemisphere, Australian mainstream record labels tried to replicate the success of trends imported from overseas and produce radio friendly singles by successful artists such as John Farnham and The Easybeats. In the meantime, Russell Morris enjoyed a surprise hit with singles such as &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. Produced by music legend Ian Molly Meldrum, and written by singing star Johnny Young, the single encompassed high production values and a psychedelic approach in its use of instruments such as a sitar, sampling of a children&#x27;s choir, and its 6-minute running time (unusually long for the time). While released by EMI, this domestic production inspired a generation of bands, singers and songwriters that home-grown Aussie talent could produce world-beating music. The single charted well in New York, Houston and Chicago.

===Regional developments: 1970s to 1980s ===

==== Brisbane ====

The punk movement began in the mid-1970s, and resulted in an explosion of musical activity. Numerous bands formed, as did many independent record labels, often run out of bedrooms. An early band who gained a following in Australia were, The Saints, who grew out of Queensland and who recorded one of the first punk singles, releasing a single on vinyl before the Sex Pistols. Another important band who came out of Brisbane were the post-punk group, The Go-Betweens, who relocated to Britain in the early 1980s and were one of the most acclaimed bands of the decade.

==== Sydney ====

Sydney&#x27;s Radio Birdman were heavily inspired by acts such as the MC5 and The Stooges, and the band defined the sound of the punk and post-punk movement in Sydney. The sound of both Midnight Oil and INXS were influenced by Radio Birdman, especially in their early albums. In 1970s Sydney, the Australian Federal Government&#x27;s &quot;youth station&quot; Double J operated outside the mainstream radio stations and began playing various independent music from around the world. Double J (an AM station) eventually turned into Triple J (an FM station) in the early 1980s and began broadcasting nationally in 1989.

By the early 1980s Sydney had begun to eclipse the post-punk explosion of gloomy drug-addled Melbourne with its beach culture, summery pub music scene, and hubris. Phantom Records, a label which grew out of a popular import record store, began to record and distribute breakthrough indie acts such as The Hoodoo Gurus, The Sunnyboys and The Cockroaches. Phantom&#x27;s success would inspire others to follow, with important indie champions, such as Died Pretty signed to the fledgling Citadel Label. Other labels, such as Waterfront Records, Hot Records and RooArt soon followed expanding opportunities for bands to record and release domestically. The number of venues exploded, and fueled by the expansion of FM radio and a prosperous economy, Sydney begun to prove that independent bands could make a healthy living on the amazing pub music circuit at home, without having to first strike out to tour overseas and release internationally acclaimed albums. Other legendary live indie bands from the 80&#x27;s era include The Hard-Ons, Celibate Rifles, New Christs, GANGgajang and The Rockmelons.

==== Perth ====

A vibrant and interesting punk and post-punk scene also developed in Perth, Western Australia. Bands such as The Victims and Cheap Nasties, spawned icons of the Australian music scene such as Dave Faulkner and James Baker, who formed one of the most popular Australian bands of the 1980s, the power-pop band Hoodoo Gurus, and the legendary Kim Salmon, who formed the Scientists, an influence on bands such as Mudhoney and The Jesus Lizard. Kim Salmon claims to have been the first person to use the term grunge to describe music. Kim Salmon and James Baker later once again collaborated in the underground rock supergroup Beasts of Bourbon, also featuring Tex Perkins and Spencer P. Jones. Perth also spawned the critically acclaimed indie-rock band The Triffids.

==== Melbourne ====

Melbourne&#x27;s post-punk scene was much more experimental than any of the other capital cities. The city spawned a lot of experimental and gothic rock, of which Nick Cave&#x27;s band, the Boys Next Door (later to become the Birthday Party) was the most notable and influential.

Soon the raw energy of punk evolved into post punk, which combined the DIY ethos of punk with rule-breaking, genre-defying artistic experimentation. The profusion of small, defiantly non-commercial and often unhesitatingly experimental bands became known as the &quot;little band scene&quot;. Throughout the 1980s, it flourished in most Australian major cities, evolving around venues (such as Melbourne&#x27;s Seaview Ballroom) and community radio stations such as 3RRR. A few bands, like Models, crossed over to the mainstream; others, like The Birthday Party went on to achieve critical acclaim abroad.

This era can be said to have ended in the 1990s, when in the wake of the explosion of grunge, alternative music became mainstream. Major labels signed three-chord grunge/punk-style rock bands, commercial radio played them and the &#x27;alternative&#x27; sound soon became ubiquitous, ultimately culminating in manufactured pop groups, styled to sound raucously &#x27;alternative&#x27; and appearing on television commercials for mobile phones. In this way, this process of mainstreaming echoes what happened in the USA and UK.

==== Gold Coast ====

A small but active Indie Rock movement was evident on the Gold Coast in the late 1970s and early 80&#x27;s. The Seven Ballerinas were an Australian Indie rock band from the Gold Coast, active from 1981 to 1984. They are a significant contributor to the alternative rock music scene on the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Sydney, being one of the first bands from the Gold Coast to perform original material to audiences Australia wide.

The Ballerinas was formed in 1981 on the Gold Coast from an amalgamation of two pre-existing new-wave bands, Ratpak and The Strand. 
At the time, there was a mood for change on the Gold Coast music scene, as seen at the Macintosh Island concert, attended by around 2,000 people was headlined by The Strand, and also included Ratpak and several other local bands. The Macintosh Island concert was a turning point in Gold Coast music. As noted at the time, it was a move away from disco, and towards a local sound that expressed the values and attitudes of Gold Coast youth.

===1990s to the present===

The mainstreaming of alternative music did not kill indie rock in Australia, though did signal a shift in its focus. The form of &#x27;alternative&#x27; music that the major labels and commercial radio stations were interested in was predominantly three-chord rock informed by punk rock and Seattle-style grunge; loud, rebellious, and easily marketable to a generation of teenagers. Bands who did not fit this manifest were largely left behind by this process, and did attract smaller audiences (predominantly in their 20s and based in bohemian inner urban areas). In inner Melbourne, a considerable post rock scene flourished, with bands like Art of Fighting, Laura, Silver Ray and Gersey playing more subdued music using the traditional guitar/bass/drums structure; bands in this scene often played at inner-city venues such as the Punters Club and the Empress Hotel. Other bands, such as The Paradise Motel explored the more cinematic scope of string sections combined with guitar/bass/drums, especially on debut recordings such as Left Over Life To Kill. Meanwhile, others explored alternative instrumentation, including accordions, strings and chromatic percussion. In the early 2000s, a notable alternative and experimental music scene began out of Sydney, including acts such as The Captain&#x27;s Package, Rica Tetas, Slimey Things and Darth Vegas.

Several indie labels of note have operated in Australia around this time. Chapter Music, established by Guy Blackman in Perth but later relocated to Melbourne, released recordings on both vinyl and CD by a wide range of artists, including Panel Of Judges and Sleepy Township, as well as a compilation of Australian 1970s/1980s post punk titled &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop It&quot;. Sydney&#x27;s Half A Cow, run by Nic Dalton, released albums by bands like Dalton&#x27;s own Sneeze, Spdfgh, and Sydney shoegazers Swirl. Fitzroy-based Trifekta, run by Tom Larnach-Jones (and distributed by major label Festival Mushroom Records) also released recordings by various more established Melbourne bands, including the beings, Ninetynine, Minimum Chips, Gersey and Architecture in Helsinki, as well as local releases of international bands like Life Without Buildings. More recently, Tasmanian-cum-Melbourne label Unstable Ape Records have been releasing many recordings by independent local bands such as Love of Diagrams, Sir and the Bird Blobs.

<text>Sir Johann Franz Julius von Haast (1 May 1822 – 16 August 1887) was a German-born New Zealand explorer, geologist, and founder of the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch.

==Early life==
Johann Franz Julius Haast was born on 1 May 1822 in Bonn, a town in the Kingdom of Prussia, to a merchant and his wife. As a child, he attended a local school but was also educated at a grammar school in Cologne. After completing his formal schooling, he then entered the University of Bonn, where he studied geology and mineralogy. However, he did not graduate. As a young man, he travelled throughout Europe before basing himself in Frankfurt, working in the trading of books and mineral samples collected on his journeys. On 26 October 1846, Haast married Antonia Schmitt at Frankfurt, Germany. The marriage, although unhappy, produced a son named Robert two years later.

Haast was fluent in English and, in 1858, was contracted by a British shipping firm, A. Willis, Gann &amp; Company, to report on the suitability of New Zealand for German emigrants. He travelled to London and in September of that year embarked aboard the &quot;Evening Star&quot;, destined for New Zealand. He arrived in Auckland on 21 December 1858 and, the following day, met the Austrian Ferdinand von Hochstetter at the home of a German emigrant. Hochstetter, on a scientific cruise aboard the ship &quot;Novara&quot;, had been invited by the Governor of New Zealand, Thomas Gore Browne, to provide advice on a recent find of a coal field south of Auckland, in Drury. Haast discovered the two men had a shared interest in geology and they quickly became friends.

==Exploring New Zealand==
Haast accompanied Hochstetter on his journey to Drury a few days later so that he could assess the natural resources and attractions of Auckland as a place for German immigration. Also present on the trip were several of Hochstetter&#x27;s fellow scientists as well as the explorer and surveyor Charles Heaphy. Haast assisted Hochstetter in his investigations of the coalfield before the party pushed further south, interacting with local Māori and journeying along part of the Waikato River before returning to Auckland in early January 1859.
Hochstetter&#x27;s report on the Drury coalfield was well received and he was formally asked to conduct geological surveys of New Zealand. His work with the &quot;Novara&quot; expedition largely complete, he agreed to stay on in New Zealand for six months, although the Austrian government would pay his salary. Hochstetter, assisted by Haast, spent the first two months on geological expeditions in the immediate area around Auckland, for the most part examining extinct volcanic cones and a multitude of historic points of eruption. Hochstetter then turned his attention south, towards the Waikato area, and requested Haast join him. The Waikato, apart from a few roads and trails, was largely unknown—the expedition, which left Auckland on 7 March 1859, had to make its own maps on the journey south. In three months they travelled as far as Lake Taupō and also went as far west as Kāwhia Harbour and as far east as Maketu in the Bay of Plenty. Arriving back in Auckland on 24 May 1859, the party, which included a photographer, had covered 1000 kilometres. Numerous collected samples, sketches and photographs taken on the journey added to the scientific knowledge of the area. It was revealed to the citizens of Auckland during a well attended public lecture delivered by Hochstetter on 24 June.

At the end of their journey south Hochstetter had told a reporter from the &quot;New Zealander&quot; that Haast had collected a great variety of statistical information to send home to Germany. It is likely however that Haast&#x27;s main focus was on geography and geology. As Hochstetter adapted his technique in the study of a new country under adverse conditions, he later referred to Haast as his enthusiastic assistant, who not only helped but pushed him forward. At the same time Haast learnt a great deal from Hochstetter&#x27;s great expertise.

During June Hochstetter and Haast departed for the Coromandel to investigate the goldfields there. Then, in late July 1859, they travelled south by steamer to the province of Nelson, stopping briefly at New Plymouth and Wellington on the way. After his lecture in Auckland, Hochstetter had received invitations from several other provinces to explore the geological makeup of their regions, but he had already accepted an invitation from the Nelson Provincial Council to inspect the mineral deposits of Nelson Province, which were believed to include gold, coal and copper. Again Haast assisted Hochstetter, and after they discovered moa bones in the Aorere Valley in Golden Bay, Hochstetter left Haast in charge of the dig while he continued with other fieldwork. Over several days, assisted by Christopher Maling of the provincial survey department, Haast extracted several near-complete skeletons of the long-extinct bird. Hochstetter then tasked him with carrying out independent fieldwork in Golden Bay and with investigating the mineral deposits to the east of Nelson. At Shakespeare Bay, near present-day Picton, he correctly predicted gold could be found based on his inspection of the rocks in the area.

Haast returned to Nelson on 24 September 1859 and met up with Hochstetter, whose time in New Zealand was drawing to a close. Hochstetter delivered a public lecture, which included both his and Haast&#x27;s geological findings, and his conclusion that the minerals in the area would contribute significantly to the wealth of the region was well received by the interested citizens of Nelson. One final common expedition at the end of September investigated a newly discovered coalfield in Golden Bay; Hochstetter then sailed for Sydney on 2 October.

Following Hochstetter&#x27;s departure from New Zealand, the Nelson Provincial Council asked Haast to build on the geological work already completed. In particular, he was to focus on identifying valuable minerals in the ranges between Nelson and the Grey River, to scout out travelling routes to Westland, and to complete a topographical map of the area.

Before beginning the survey Haast visited Canterbury Province, possibly to complete his German immigration report for A. Willis, Gann &amp; Company. Hochstetter had written ahead to the Canterbury Provincial Government apologising for not visiting personally, but informing them that Haast would soon go there and during his stay would gather geological information on his behalf. While there Haast proposed that following on from his work in Nelson he could undertake a similar survey of Canterbury&#x27;s portion of the West Coast.

Haast&#x27;s topographical and geological survey of south west Nelson took eight months, from January to August 1860. His report to the Nelson Provincial Council was published in early 1861 and of note were his discoveries of coal near the present-day town of Westport. He also found that the coal seams discovered by Thomas Brunner in 1848 were of a higher quality than first thought. He found gold in several tributaries of the Upper Buller, and reported on his botanical and zoological findings.

==Life in Canterbury==

When Haast arrived in Canterbury to begin his survey of their portion of the West Coast, the Superintendent of Canterbury William Moorhouse instead requested that he investigate the mountain range between Lyttelton and Christchurch. A rail tunnel was proposed through the mountain to link Lyttelton and Christchurch, but engineers had encountered particular tough basaltic rocks, which jeopardised the proposed route. As a result of Haast&#x27;s work, the rail link was able to proceed. He became provincial geologist to Canterbury, a post that he held from 1861 to 1868.

His work in this capacity saw Haast conducting numerous expeditions throughout Canterbury and Westland, making geological discoveries and topographical maps of the area. Late in 1861, he discovered a coal seam in Kowai and the following year searched for gold in the area around Aoraki / Mount Cook. He identified that the Mackenzie plains were once the bed of a major glacier and, as well as his geological observations, he collected numerous botanical specimens. He discovered and named many of the glaciers of the central South Island, including the Franz Joseph Glacier, in honour of the Emperor of Austria, Franz Joseph. He was the first person to study the bones of the extinct Haast&#x27;s eagle.

In 1870, Haast was appointed the curator of Canterbury Museum. The specimens that he collected on his expeditions of earlier years were a key part of the early holdings of the museum. Following the establishment of the Canterbury University College, he lectured in geology from 1873, and was made professor in 1876.

In the 1870s Haast was involved with James Hector in one of New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;most bitter scientific arguments&quot;, involving the extinction of the moa and Moa-hunter origins – the &quot;Sumner Cave Controversy&quot; (&quot;see Moriori in popular culture&quot;). Haast held that the Moriori Moa-hunters preceded Māori to New Zealand.
His &quot;Geology of the Provinces of Canterbury and Westland, N.Z.&quot;, was published in 1879. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1867, and was given a hereditary knighthood by the Emperor of Austria in 1875. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Patron&#x27;s Medal in 1884 for his explorations in New Zealand.

==Later life and legacy==
Haast travelled to England in 1886, as New Zealand&#x27;s commissioner to the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London. While there, he was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George for his services. He had previously been made a Companion of the same order three years previously.

Haast died on 16 August 1887, following his return to Christchurch. He is buried in the grounds of Holy Trinity Church in Stanmore Road, Christchurch. He was survived by his second wife, Mary Dobson, daughter of the Canterbury Provincial Engineer Edward Dobson, and the couple&#x27;s five children.

Several places in New Zealand are named after Haast, including Haast Pass and the Haast River (both named by himself). The town of Haast is located at the mouth of the Haast River. The schist found in New Zealand is called the &quot;Haast Schist&quot; as a tribute to his contributions to geology. James Mackay (1831–1912) named two peaks after Haast: Mount Haast in the Southern Alps and Mount Haast near Springs Junction in the Buller District. The Haast Glacier and Haast Range in the Southern Alps were named by James Hector. The Haast Ridge was named by William Spotswood Green.

In 2019, Haast&#x27;s personal papers held at the Alexander Turnbull Library, including many of Haast&#x27;s artworks and his correspondence from Charles Darwin, were added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register.

<text>Robert Kerr (June 9, 1882 – May 12, 1963) was an Irish Canadian sprinter. He won the gold medal in the 200 metres and the bronze medal in the 100 metres at the 1908 Summer Olympics.

== Biography ==
Kerr was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland. His family immigrated to Canada when he was five, eventually settling in Hamilton, Ontario. While working as a fireman, Kerr also enjoyed running in his spare time. He soon became the best regional sprinter, and in 1904 he used his savings to travel to Saint Louis, United States and compete in the 1904 Summer Olympics. There, he was eliminated in the heats of all three events he entered (60 metres, 100 metres and 200 metres).

However, Kerr&#x27;s performances got better, and he set Canadian records in all sprint distances between 40 and 220 yards. He won Canadian titles in the 100 yards (1907) and 200 yards (1906 to 1908). In 1908, Kerr travelled to England, where he competed in the 1908 AAA Championships, winning both the 100 and 200 yards.

At the 1908 Summer Olympics, held in London, Kerr was considered to be somewhat of a home favourite by the crowd, as they saw him as a representative of the British Empire. He greatly improved on his Olympic performances of 1904, placing for the final of the 100 and 200 metres. In the 100 metres, he finished in third (behind South Africa&#x27;s Reggie Walker and the United States&#x27; James Rector) with a time of 11.0 seconds. In the final of the 200 metres, held the next day, Kerr crossed the line first with a time of 22.6 seconds. News of his victory set off celebrations in his home town Hamilton.

During the First World War, Kerr became an officer with the 205th (Tiger) Battalion, CEF, which was also known as the Sportsmen&#x27;s Battalion because many of its members were prominent local athletes. When that unit was disbanded, he was transferred to the 164th (Halton and Dufferin) Battalion, CEF and eventually was assigned to the Canadian Machine Gun Corps (misnamed the 1st Tank Battalion, CEF]).

After his sprinting career, Kerr remained active in sports. He coached the athletics and football teams of Hamilton, and was an official at the 1928 and 1932 Summer Olympics. In 1928, he witnessed Percy Williams succeeding him as Canadian winner of the 200 metres. Furthermore, he was involved in the Canadian Olympic Association, and helped organize the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton.

Kerr died in Hamilton, aged 80. A park in his home town was named in his honour.

<text>John Charles Galliano, (born 28 November 1960), is a British fashion designer. He was the creative director of his eponymous label John Galliano and French fashion houses Givenchy and Dior. From 2014 to 2024, Galliano was the creative director of Paris-based fashion house Maison Margiela. Galliano has been named British Designer of the Year four times. In a 2004 poll for the BBC, he was named the fifth most influential person in British culture.

==Early life and education ==
Galliano was born in Gibraltar to a Gibraltarian father of Italian descent, Juan Galliano, and a Spanish mother, Ana Guillén, and has two sisters. His father worked as a plumber. His family moved to England when Galliano was six, settling in Streatham and later Dulwich and Brockley, in South London. He was raised in a strict Catholic family.

Galliano attended St. Anthony&#x27;s Primary School, Dulwich and Wilson&#x27;s Grammar School in London. He went on to study at Central Saint Martins and graduated in 1984 with a first class honours degree in Fashion Design. His graduating collection was inspired by the French Revolution and entitled &quot;Les Incroyables&quot;. The collection received positive reviews and was bought in its entirety for resale in the London fashion boutique Browns.

==Career==
===Early career and the John Galliano label===
====London====
Galliano then started his own eponymous label alongside long-term collaborators Amanda Harlech, at that time stylist with &quot;Harpers and Queen&quot;, and milliner Stephen Jones. On the back of this success, Galliano rented studio space in London. Initially, financial backing came from Johan Brun, and when this agreement came to an end, Danish entrepreneur Ole Peder Bertelsen, owner of firm Aguecheek, who were also backing Katharine Hamnett at the time, took over. This agreement ended in 1988 and he went bankrupt after his own London-based label failed.

====Paris====
In 1989, Galliano moved to Paris in search of financial backing and a strong client base. Galliano secured the backing of Paris-based Moroccan designer Faycal Amor (owner and creative director of fashion label Plein Sud) who invited him to set up his base in Paris at the Plein Sud headquarters. His first show was in 1989 as part of Paris Fashion Week.

Media fashion celebrity Susannah Constantine has worked for Galliano, and he has also aided the future success of other designers including shoe designer Patrick Cox. In 1991, he collaborated with Kylie Minogue, designing the costumes for her Let&#x27;s Get to It Tour.

In 1993, Galliano&#x27;s financial agreement with Amor ended and he did not have a showing in October, missing the season. With the help of American &quot;Vogue&quot; editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and André Leon Talley, then European correspondent at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Galliano was introduced to Portuguese socialite and fashion patron São Schlumberger and financial backers of venture firm Arbela Inc, John and Mark Rice. It was through this partnership that Galliano received the financial backing and high society stamp needed to give him credibility in Paris. This collection was important in the development of Galliano as a fashion house, and is regarded as a &#x27;fashion moment&#x27; in high fashion circles.

===Givenchy===
In July 1995, he was appointed as the head designer of Givenchy by Bernard Arnault, owner of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. Galliano thus became the first British designer to head a French haute couture fashion house. On 21 January 1996, he presented his first couture show at the helm of Givenchy at the Stade de France. The collection received high praise within the fashion media. Some of Galliano&#x27;s designs for Givenchy were licensed to Vogue Patterns. When he left Givenchy, he was succeeded by Alexander McQueen.

===Dior===

In October 1996, LVMH moved Galliano to Christian Dior, replacing Italian designer Gianfranco Ferré. At Dior, Galliano received widespread critical acclaim for his Haute Couture and ready-to-wear collections, for the whole duration of his tenure there.

Galliano designed the chartreuse Chinoiserie gown worn by Nicole Kidman at the 69th Academy Awards in 1997.

In 2007, a close friend of Galliano, Steven Robinson, died. At the time, it was maintained that he died from a heart attack, but it was later revealed to have been a drug overdose that killed him. Robinson had worked closely with Galliano and been his supporter, providing creative input for over 20 years and organizing many of his events. According to the documentary &quot;High and Low&quot;, Galliano stated Robinson&#x27;s death affected him heavily.

====Antisemitic incident and firing====

In December 2010, a drunken Galliano insulted a group of Italian women in Paris with antisemitic slurs, which was caught on camera. The video resurfaced in February 2011, just before Paris Fashion Week Autumn/Winter 2011/2012. Facing public and legal scrutiny, he was fired from his role as creative director at Dior.

===Oscar de la Renta===
In 2013, a &quot;Guardian&quot; article describing Galliano&#x27;s incident claims &quot;fashion forgave John Galliano&quot; due to his &quot;two years&#x27; exile&quot; and &quot;several statements expressing his sorrow and self-disgust.&quot;

In early 2013, Galliano accepted an invitation from Oscar de la Renta, brokered by Anna Wintour, for a temporary residency at de la Renta&#x27;s design studio to help prepare for a showing of his Fall 2013 ready-to-wear collection during February New York Fashion Week. Galliano also received a measure of absolution from the Anti-Defamation League, which lauded his efforts to atone for his misdeeds and wished him well. The ADL again came to his defence after the &quot;New York Post&quot; ran a photo of him on his way to the de la Renta show dressed in what it claimed was Hasidic-like garb.

Galliano remained backstage at the show, which received favourable reviews amid speculation about his future, including as a possible successor to Oscar de la Renta and that Galliano might take up a teaching post at Parsons The New School for Design. On 12 June 2013, Galliano&#x27;s first filmed interview since his dismissal from Christian Dior was broadcast on United States television. He closed this conversation by stating, &quot;I am able to create. I am ready to create... [and] I hope through my atonement I&#x27;ll be given a second chance&quot;.

===Maison Margiela===
On 6 October 2014, the OTB Group announced that John Galliano had joined Maison Margiela to take the responsibility of the creative direction of the house, marking the designer&#x27;s return to a leading role in designing luxury fashion. Just a few weeks later, on the occasion of the annual British Fashion Awards, Galliano presented the Outstanding Achievement Award to Anna Wintour who wore Galliano&#x27;s first creation for Maison Martin Margiela, &quot;an unambiguous fashion blessing&quot; from the Editor in Chief of American &quot;Vogue&quot; according to Vanessa Friedman, Fashion Director of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Galliano exhibited his first couture collection for Margiela during London Collections: Men, on 12 January 2015. He told French &quot;Elle&quot; in 2018 that he would stop using fur in his collections, citing as inspiration from a meeting with Penélope Cruz and PETA&#x27;s Dan Mathews.

On 26 September 2018, Galliano made a statement in Paris at his Maison Margiela show, when he unveiled Mutiny, his first perfume for the fashion house. 

The designer left Maison Margiela in December 2024.

==Controversies==
===Antisemitic outburst===
Circa December 2010, a drunken Galliano insulted a group of Jewish women in Paris bar La Perle, saying: &quot;I love Hitler... People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers would all be fucking gassed&quot;. The video resurfaced in February 2011, just before Paris Fashion Week Autumn/Winter 2011/2012.

On 25 February 2011, Dior announced their suspension of Galliano including the following statement:Because of the particularly odious character of the behaviour and comments made by John Galliano in a video made public on Monday, the Dior house decided to suspend him immediately and has engaged in a process to dismiss him.The show-business industry expressed mixed feelings towards the designer&#x27;s antisemitic speech. Natalie Portman, who had an endorsement contract with Dior, said she was &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by Galliano&#x27;s comments and that &quot;these still-existing prejudices... are the opposite of all that is beautiful&quot; and &quot;As an individual who is proud to be Jewish, [she] will not be associated with Mr. Galliano in any way&quot;. However, another model for Dior, French model and actress Eva Green, said of the incident: &quot;Sometimes, you can make mistakes. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s antisemitic. I&#x27;m Jewish. I don&#x27;t think he has anything against the Jews. I think it&#x27;s more that he was probably a bit drunk&quot;.

Galliano denied the allegations through his lawyer, and launched a defamation lawsuit against the couple accusing him of antisemitism. On 1 March 2011, Dior announced that it had begun procedures of dismissal for Galliano, with Dior&#x27;s chief executive Sidney Toledano stating, &quot;I very firmly condemn what was said by John Galliano&quot;, Dior announced it will continue to support the Galliano brand financially due to licence despite the scandal, and Bill Gaytten would replace John Galliano as creative director at the helm of Dior and the Galliano brand.

In France, the expression of antisemitic ideas is illegal. It was reported on 2 March 2011 that Galliano was to face trial in Paris for allegedly making antisemitic comments to two fellow customers in a café. The trial commenced on 22 June 2011. Galliano&#x27;s lawyer argued that the &quot;series of public outbursts during which he uttered racist and anti-Semitic insults in a Paris café&quot; were the result of &quot;work-related stress and multiple addictions&quot;.

Galliano said that his mental state had been affected by the death of his friend and close business partner, Steven Robinson. On 8 September 2011, Galliano was found guilty of making antisemitic remarks and sentenced to a total of €6,000 in suspended fines.

====Subsequent legal action====
On 21 November 2013, the Paris Court of Appeals rejected an appeal by Christian Dior Couture SA, which was seeking to move the case to a commercial court from the (Labour Court) and ordered Christian Dior Couture SA and John Galliano SA each to pay Galliano €2,500 and court costs. Galliano had been &quot;seeking compensation in the range of 6 million euros&quot;. He lost the case in the labor court and was required to pay each party €1.

==Honours==
* British Designer of the Year (1987, 1994, 1995, 1997). In 1997, he shared the award with Alexander McQueen, his successor at Givenchy.
* Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 Birthday Honours List for his services to the Fashion Industry as a Fashion Designer. He received his CBE on 27 November 2001 at Buckingham Palace in London, England.

* Appearance on &quot;The Independent on Sunday&#x27;s&quot; 2007 &quot;pink list&quot; for being one of &quot;the most influential gay people in Britain&quot;
* French Legion of Honour (2009). The medal was withdrawn by decree of the president of the Republic, François Hollande, published in the official journal on 20 August 2012.

== Personal life ==
In 2010, Galliano identified his love of theatre and femininity as central to his creations; he said &quot;my role is to seduce&quot;, and credited Standard Oil heiress Millicent Rogers as an influence. 

In interviews, Galliano has given his full name as Juan Carlos Antonio Galliano-Guillén. He had a relationship with fellow Central St Martins student and fashion designer John Flett (1963–1991), whom he described as his soulmate. Galliano currently shares his Paris home with his long-term partner Alexis Roche, a style consultant. He is vegetarian for health reasons, telling French &quot;Elle&quot; that &quot;The energy that I get from having fewer toxins in my body is extraordinary&quot;.

<doc id="506102" wikidata="Q2891532" url="?curid=506102" title="Mesillat Yesharim">
<text>Mesillat Yesharim or Mesillas Yeshorim (, lit. &quot;Path of the Upright&quot;) is an ethical (&quot;musar&quot;) text composed by the influential Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (1707–1746). It is different from Luzzato&#x27;s other writings, which are more philosophical.

&quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; was written and published in Amsterdam. The earliest known manuscript version, written in 1738, was arranged as a dialogue between a &quot;hakham&quot; (wise man) and a &quot;hasid&quot; (pious person). Before publication, it was rearranged to have only one speaker. The dialogue version often sheds light on the more well-known version.

&quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; is probably Luzzato&#x27;s most influential work, widely learned in virtually every &quot;yeshiva&quot; since formal study of musar texts was introduced to the yeshiva curriculum by the Mussar Movement of Rabbi Yisroel Salanter.

==Aim of the work==
The aim of this work extends beyond the achievement of the perfection of human character in Divine service. Its stated aim is to remind the reader of one&#x27;s deepest obligations in this regard, as well as to encourage the centrality of the deep study of this subject matter in one&#x27;s daily life. Unlike many other musar books, which are ordered according to the authors&#x27; own lists of character traits, Luzzato builds his work on a Beraita in the name of the sage Pinchas ben Yair, whose list goes in order of accomplishment:

:&quot;Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair said: Torah leads to watchfulness; watchfulness leads to alacrity; alacrity leads to cleanliness; cleanliness leads to abstention; abstention leads to purity; purity leads to piety; piety leads to humility; humility leads to fear of sin; fear of sin leads to holiness; holiness leads to prophecy; prophecy leads to the resurrection of the dead&quot;.

Within each step, Luzzatto explains the step itself, its elements, how it can be acquired, and what might detract from its acquisition. For example: Watchfulness can be acquired by setting aside time for introspection, and acquiring watchfulness can be impaired by excessive mundane responsibilities, wrong company or a cynical stance in life. The same pattern is used for every single one of the traits mentioned.

Luzzatto&#x27;s expressed goal is to condition the reader to accept a disciplined approach to &quot;restrain animal instincts&quot; and encourage &quot;the divine spark in every human into a bright, warming flame&quot;, according to Trude Weiss-Rosmarin.

==Outline==
&quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; is divided into 26 chapters, over which Luzzatoo explains the ethical and religious duties commanded in the Torah and elaborated by the Sages.

: Introduction
: Man&#x27;s General Duty in His World (Ch. 1)
: Watchfulness (&quot;zehirut&quot;) (Ch. 2-5)
: Alacrity (&quot;zerizut&quot;) (Ch. 6-9)
: Cleanliness (of sin, &quot;nekiyut&quot;) (Ch. 10-12)
: Abstention (of improper practices, &quot;perishut&quot;) (Ch. 13-15)
: Purity (&quot;tahara&quot;) (Ch. 16-17)
: Piety (&quot;chassidut&quot;) (Ch. 18-21)
: Humility (&quot;anava&quot;) (Ch. 22-23)
: Fear of sin (&quot;yirat chet&quot;) (Ch. 24-25)
: Holiness (&quot;kedusha&quot;) (Ch. 26-27)
: Epilogue

==Influence==
&quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; is perhaps the most important Jewish ethical text of the early modern period. The Vilna Gaon is reported to have commented that he could not find a superfluous word in the first eleven chapters of the work, and stated that he would have traveled to meet the author and learn from his ways if he had still been alive. These and similar pronouncements largely cleared Luzzato from misgivings by others as to his suspected Sabbatean leanings.

&quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; became Luzzatto&#x27;s most famous ethical tract and one of the most popular Jewish ethical treatises. It was published in ten different editions between 1740 and 1835. Along with &quot;Shirei Tiferet&quot; (&quot;Poems of Glory&quot;) by Naphtali Hirz Wessely, &quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; became part of the canon of mussar literature of the course of the 1780s to the middle of the 19th century.

American rabbi Mordecai Kaplan published the first English translation of &quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; through the Jewish Publication Society of America in 1936.

<text>Robert Alexander (c. 1740 – 1805) was an American planter, lawyer, and politician. During the American Revolution, he was a delegate to the Continental Congress for Maryland in 1776.

== Background ==
Robert Alexander was born on his family&#x27;s estate at &quot;Head of Elk&quot; in Cecil County, Maryland about 1740. He was educated to the law and admitted to the bar, and practiced in Baltimore. From 1774 to 1776, he attended the Annapolis Convention as a representative of Baltimore County. He also represented Baltimore in the state&#x27;s &quot;Committee of Safety&quot;.

On December 9, 1775 the Convention named Alexander one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. He attended sessions starting in January 1776, and on January 16 the Congress added him to their &quot;Secret Committee&quot;. Then in April he was added to the Marine Committee. He was re-elected, 4 July 1776, but soon after the promulgation of the Declaration of Independence he sailed for England with other Baltimore loyalists.

In August 1777, after British forces had landed at Head of Elk, he was visited at his home, first by American General George Washington on August 27, and then by British General William Howe three days later. When British forces moved north towards Philadelphia he accompanied them, never to return. By the summer of 1778, when the British abandoned Philadelphia, Alexander fled to England onboard a Royal Navy ship, and made his way to London in 1782.

In 1780, the State of Maryland judged Alexander guilty of high treason, and seized most of his property. His estate became the town of Elkton, Maryland, although the wife he had abandoned was allowed to keep the main house that his father had built in 1735. The house still stands, and is located at 323 Hermitage Drive in Elkton.

Alexander died in exile in London in November 1805.

<text>The Beretta 92 (also Beretta 96 and Beretta 98) is a series of semi-automatic pistols designed and manufactured by Beretta of Italy. The Beretta 92 was designed in 1975, and production began in 1976. Many variants in several calibers continue to be used to the present.

The United States military replaced the .45 ACP M1911A1 pistol in 1985 with the Beretta 92FS, designated as the &quot;M9&quot;.

==History==
The Beretta 92 pistol evolved from earlier Beretta designs, most notably the M1923 and M1951. From the M1923 comes the open slide design, while the alloy frame and the hinged locking block, originally from Walther P38, were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. What were perhaps the Model 92&#x27;s two most important advanced design features had first appeared on its immediate predecessor, the 1974 .380 caliber Model 84. These improvements both involved the magazine, which featured direct feed; that is, there was no feed ramp between the magazine and the chamber (a Beretta innovation in pistols). In addition, the magazine was a &quot;double-stacked&quot; design, a feature originally introduced in 1935 on the Browning Hi-Power.

Carlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti and Vittorio Valle, all experienced firearms designers, contributed to the final design in 1975.

===Evolution===

====92====
Production began in May 1976, and ended in February 1983. Approximately 7,000 units were of the first &quot;step slide&quot; design and 45,000 were of the second &quot;straight slide&quot; type.

====92S====
In order to meet the requirements of some law enforcement agencies, Beretta modified the Beretta 92 by adding a slide-mounted combined safety and decocking lever, replacing the frame-mounted manual thumb safety. This resulted in the 92S, which was adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units. The magazine release button is at the bottom of the grip as is customary in Europe. This model was produced from 1978 to 1982. The name &quot;92S&quot; means &quot;Sicurezza&quot;, or &quot;security&quot; (as in &quot;safety&quot;), in Italian.

====92SB (92S-1)====
The 92SB, initially called 92S-1, was specifically designed for the USAF trials. The 92SB model name was officially adopted after winning. &quot;92SB&quot; means &quot;Sicurezza Blocco&quot;, meaning &quot;safety block&quot; in Italian. This refers to both the slide-mounted safety and the internal firing pin block. Other improvements include ambidextrous safety levers, 3-dot sights and relocating the magazine release catch from the bottom of the grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard. The later relocation of the magazine release button means preceding models (92 &amp; 92S) cannot necessarily use later magazines, unless they have notches in both areas.
A compact version with a shortened barrel and slide and 13-round magazine capacity known as the 92SB Compact was manufactured from 1981 to 1991.

====92F (92SB-F)====

In 1984 Beretta introduced a version of the model 92SB slightly modified to create the 92SB-F (the &quot;F&quot; meaning &quot;Federale&quot;, or &quot;Federal&quot; in Italian, added to denote entry of the model in U.S. Government federal testing) by making the following changes:
* Design of all the parts to make them 100% interchangeable to simplify maintenance for large government organizations.
* Squared off the front of the trigger guard. The squared-off trigger guard protects both the gun and the shooter during hand-to-hand combat. Some have suggested that the square guard enables the shooter to grip the front of the trigger guard with the supporting forefinger to enhance aiming; however, firearms trainer and Beretta collaborator Ernest Langdon says that using the forefinger to grip the front of the trigger guard is improper technique.
* Recurved the forward base of the grip to aid aiming.
* Hard chromed the bore to protect it from corrosion and to reduce wear.
* New surface coating on the slide called &quot;Bruniton&quot;, which purportedly provides better corrosion resistance than the previous plain blued finish.


The French military adopted a modified version of the 92F with a decocking-only lever as the PAMAS G1. These pistols have tellurium in the slide, making the French made steel brittle, and as such only have a service life of approximately 6,000 rounds. The French military fitted new Italian made steel slides to its PAMAS G1 pistols before they reached that round count.

====92FS====
The 92FS has an enlarged hammer pin that fits into a groove on the underside of the slide. The main purpose is to stop the slide from flying off the frame to the rear if it cracks, potentially injuring the user. The &quot;S&quot; in &quot;92FS&quot; signifies either &quot;Scivolo&quot; (meaning &quot;slide&quot;) or &quot;Sicurezza&quot; (meaning &quot;security&quot; or &quot;safety&quot;) in Italian, due to the design&#x27;s improved and safer slide in case of a catastrophic failure. This was in response to reported defective slides during U.S. military testing. Beretta discovered in an investigation that the slides had passed high-pressure proof testing and magnetic particle inspection when they were made, and metallurgical analysis showed that they had indeed been made to the proper specification. In reality, the guns were cracking and being blown apart due to improperly made ammunition, which was far more powerful than NATO specifications. 
The 92FS also came as a 92FS Centurion model which featured the shorter barrel and slide of the 92 Compact on a full-size 92FS frame.

==Design==

The Beretta 92&#x27;s open slide design ensures smooth feeding and ejection of ammunition and allows easy clearing of obstructions. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy and operability with suppressors due to the in-line travel of the barrel. This is in contrast to the complex travel of Browning designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much easier.

Increasingly, it has become popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as increase corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil spring guide rod (which is now also fluted), magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine release button.

===Magazines===
To keep in line with the introduction of laws in some locations restricting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, Beretta now manufactures magazines that hold fewer than the factory-standard 15 rounds. These magazines have heavier crimping (deeper indentations in the side) to reduce the available space while still keeping the same external dimensions and ensuring that these magazines can be used on existing firearms. Beretta also produces 15-round &quot;Sand Resistant&quot; magazines to resolve issues encountered with contractor-made magazines, and 17-round magazines included with the A1 models. Both magazines function in earlier 92 series and M9 model pistols.

Italian magazine manufacturer Mec-Gar now produces magazines in blue and nickel finishes with an 18-round capacity, which fit flush in the magazine well on the 92 series. Mec-Gar also produces an extended 20-round blued magazine that protrudes below the frame by . These magazines provide users in unrestricted states with a larger capacity magazine.

==Variants==

The Beretta 92 is available in many configurations and models:

===Models===

;92D / 92DS : (1990–1998)
:The 92D is a double action only variant of the 92FS with no safety/decocker lever. The &quot;D&quot; signifies the Italian word &quot;Doppio&quot;, meaning &quot;Double-action&quot;. The 92D was discontinued by 1998. The 92DS (meaning &quot;92D-Safety&quot;) is essentially a standard double-action/single-action Beretta 92FS with a safety/decock lever but the flat spurless hammer of the 92D. 


;92G / 92G-SD : (2002–present)
:The 92G is a redesigned version of the 92FS with the safety eliminated, making for a decocker-only slide. The &quot;G&quot; signifies &quot;Gendarmerie National&quot;, the French national police force that the pistol was designed for. While the standard 92G was discontinued in 2005, the 92G slide design is still being used on various Beretta designs, including the M9A4. The Wilson Combat 92G Brigadier Tactical has been produced since 2014. The Wilson Combat 92G Brigadier pistols differ from the standard Brigadier in that they have a military standard 1913 picatinny rail, all steel controls (as opposed to the polymer coated steel), decock only feature (G-model), 4.7&quot; target crowned barrel, fluted steel guiderod, thin profile G-10 grips, rounded trigger guard, the lighter hammer spring used in the &quot;D&quot; model, Elite II hammer, and their own unique serial number with a &quot;WC&quot; prefix among other features.

;Vertec : (2001–2007, 2014–2018)
:The Vertec is a variant of the 92-series with a re-contoured, straight backstrap, removable sights, 1-slot accessory rail, flared magwell, and 4.7 inch barrel. Although the standard Vertec has been discontinued, the Vertec style backstrap design has been retained on newer, more advanced models such as the M9A3, M9A4 and 92X.

;90Two : (2006–2012)
:The 90two is a 9mm/.40 variant of the 92-series with a redesigned, thicker slide and frame to accommodate an accessory rail, fully dovetailed front sight and .40 S&amp;W pressures. Other features added include a captive recoil spring, internal recoil buffer, user changeable monogrips and 17-round magazines.
;92A1 / 96A1 : (2010–present)
:The 92A1 and 96A1 were introduced in 2010, based on elements from the 92FS and 90two. It is somewhat of a civilian version of the M9A1, but it has the standard 92-series grip profile, two slots in the accessory rail and a round trigger guard.

;Centennial: (2015)
:The 92 FS Centennial limited edition (500 units) commemorates adoption by the Italian Military of Beretta&#x27;s earliest semi-automatic pistol, the Model 1915. This Centennial 92 is notable for its frame-mounted manual safety and single-action-only mechanism. The Beretta medallion in each wood grip panel displays the anniversary dates in Roman numerals, which are also engraved on either side of the steel slide. The pistol is packaged in a custom M2A1 ammunition can bearing the Centennial logo.

;M9A1: (2006–present)
:The M9A1 was adopted by the USMC in 2006. It adds a 1-slot Picatinny rail, more aggressive front and backstrap checkering and a beveled magazine well for easier reloading of the weapon. M9A1 pistols are sold with physical vapor deposition (PVD) coated magazines developed to better withstand the conditions in the sandy environments in Iraq and Afghanistan.

;M9A3: (2015–present)
: The M9A3 (originally called the M9A2, but the name was changed because it was not adopted) was released in 2015 as a potential upgrade for the US military, in response to the Modular Handgun System trials. The main updates to the M9A3 were a 3-slot Picatinny rail, thinner vertical grip, removable wrap-around grips that can be swapped between Vertec-style and &#x27;old&#x27; M9 style, fully removable tritium night sights and a universal slide, which makes the gun convertible from decocker-safety to decocker-only mode. The tip of the barrel is pre-threaded to facilitate addition of a suppressor. Additionally, the M9A3 comes with 17-round sand-resistant magazines in a beveled shape for easier reloading.

;M9A4: (2021–present)
:The M9A4 was released in 2021 as a direct upgrade for the M9A3. The main updates to the M9A4 include red-dot optic compatible slide and dovetailed tritium night sights, enhanced short reset Xtreme Trigger System, 18-round sand-resistant magazines, and texturized Vertec-style thin grips.

; Elite LTT - Langdon Tactical
: The Elite LTT was introduced by Beretta in 2018, in conjunction with firearms trainer Ernest Langdon. The LTT uses the Vertec slide with front cocking serrations on a modified M9A1 frame, and wears Langdon Tactical G10 grips. The pistol comes equipped with G-Model decocker, dovetailed front sight, steel trigger and guide rod, improved springs, and a 4.7 inch stainless barrel with target crown, just to name a few of the more prominent features.

;92X: (2019–present)
: The 92X was introduced in 2019 as an update to the 92-series and standardization of the Vertec platform. Similar to the M9A3, it features a 3-slot Picatinny rail, thinner vertical grip, removable wrap-around grips that can be swapped between Vertec-style and &#x27;old&#x27; M9 style, fully removable sights (High visibility orange dot) and a universal slide, which makes the gun convertible from decocker-safety to decocker-only mode. Unlike the M9A3, the barrel is not threaded. The 92X series comes in compact, centurion, and full size variants. The &quot;X&quot; signifies the &quot;Xtreme-S&quot; trigger system, which reduces trigger reset by 40%, and is adjustable for pre-travel (in single action only models), as well as overtravel. The 92X Performance was introduced in 2019, alongside the 92X, as a competition pistol. Similar to the 92X, it features a 3-slot Picatinny rail, thinner Vertec-style grip, removable wrap-around grips that can be swapped between Vertec-style and &#x27;old&#x27; M9 style, dovetailed sights. The 92X Performance however includes a red fiber optic front sight, adjustable rear sight, front and rear slide serrations, skeletonized hammer, competition hammer spring, steel spring recoil rod, extended beavertail, front and rear frame checkering, oversized magazine release, and match take down lever. The Vertec frame is made of steel rather than alloy, increasing the weight to 48 ounces. The 92X Performance utilizes a frame mounted safety compared to the slide mounted safety of the standard 92X.

;92XI: (2023–present)
: The 92XI was introduced in 2023 as an update to the 92-series including a frame-mounted safety similar to the 1911 platform. Unlike prior models, the 92XI is single-action only, with no double-action trigger pull in the Extreme-S flat-faced trigger. This hybridization is behind the XI moniker, as XI is eleven in Roman numerals, making the name ninety-two eleven. Similar to the M9A3, it features a 3-slot Picatinny rail, the thinner vertec frame and fully removable sights (High visibility fiber optic front). The 92XI comes in the base model as well as a Tactical model with a threaded barrel and DLC-coated trigger components, and a Squalo (&quot;Shark&quot;) edition that brings a different color scheme and adds a Toni system magwell.

;92 GTS: (2024–present)
: The 92 GTS was introduced in 2024 as an update to the 92XI series, adding a double-action/single-action option to the platform through a newly designed &quot;twin sear&quot; and decocker-only configuration, hence the GTS name (G-series, Twin Sear). The 92GTS has a standard model as well as a Launch Edition that comes in a two-tone finish with wood grips.

===93R machine pistol===

The Beretta 93R is a significantly redesigned 92 to provide the option of firing in three-round bursts. It also has a longer ported barrel, heavier slide, fitting for a shoulder stock, a folding forward grip, and an extended magazine. Unlike other Berettas in the 90 series it is single-action only, does not have a decocker, and very few are around today.

==Copies==

The Beretta 92 was designed for sports and law enforcement use and, due to its reliability, was accepted by military users in countries all over the world.

;Brazil
:After a large order of original 92s for the Brazilian military had been completed, the factory was sold to Taurus, who continued to make the gun as the PT92.

;Egypt
:Egypt had produced the Beretta 92 under license as the Helwan 920 with the magazine release button at the bottom of the magazine.

;South Africa
:Vektor Z-88 (see also Vektor SP1).

;Turkey
:Turkish companies MKEK and Girsan manufactured a copy of the Beretta 92F as the Yavuz 16 for the Turkish Armed Forces and General Directorate of Security. There has been speculation that these were being made under contract from Beretta. Some of these pistols were imported into the United States by the company American Tactical Imports as the American Tactical 92 or AT-92. The Yavuz 16 was exported to Canada, Colombia, Georgia, Malaysia, Syria and Philippines.

<text>The Scientists are a post-punk band from Perth, Western Australia, led by Kim Salmon, initially known as the Exterminators and then the Invaders. The band had two primary incarnations: the Perth-based punk band of the late 1970s and the Sydney/London-based swamp rock band of the 1980s.

In October 2010, &quot;Blood Red River&quot; (1983) was included in the list in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

==History==
===1976–1977: formation===
Kim Salmon had formed a punk band, the Cheap Nasties, in August 1976. He left in December 1977 and the remainder, with Robbie Porritt joining as lead vocalist, continued as the Manikins. Salmon replaced Mark Demetrius in the Exterminators, who then became known as the Invaders. The lineup included Roddy Radalj (guitar, vocals), Boris Sujdovic (bass) and John Rowlings (drums).

===1978–1981: Perth===
The Invaders became the Scientists in May 1978, when James Baker from the Victims replaced Rowlings. Sujdovic left the band in August 1978 (later recording with the Rockets). The songwriting partnership that ensued, with Baker writing lyrics which Salmon would put to music, naturally favoured a melodic, pop-infused style of punk.
The band started playing again in January 1979 with Dennis Byrne on bass. This lineup recorded the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Frantic Romantic&quot;/&quot;Shake (Together Tonight)&quot;, released in June 1979 on the D.N.A. Records label.

Radalj and Byrne left in April 1979, replaced by Ben Juniper (guitar) and Ian Sharples (bass). This lineup recorded the band&#x27;s second release, &quot;The Scientists EP&quot; (released February 1980 by White Rider Records) and did two tours of Melbourne and Sydney, in December 1979 and February/March 1980. In Melbourne, the band appeared on pop TV show &quot;Countdown&quot;, performing &quot;Last Night&quot; from the EP.

Juniper left the band in May 1980, and Salmon, Baker and Sharples continued as a trio. The band broke up in January 1981 after recording their debut album, &quot;The Scientists&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;The Pink Album&quot;), released in August 1981 by EMI Custom Records. In Sydney, Baker had joined Radalj to form Le Hoodoo Gurus with Dave Faulkner (ex-the Victims) and Kimble Rendall in January 1981.

Salmon then formed Louie Louie with Kim Williams (bass) and Brett Rixon (drums), though this band broke up in August 1981.

===1982–1987: Sydney and London===
In September 1981, Salmon and Sujdovic reformed the band, with Rixon on drums and Tony Thewlis (ex-Helicopters) on guitar, and prepared to move to Sydney. For this version of the band, the musical direction of the band turned more towards swampy, psychedelic-tinged rock and roll, incorporating the influence of bands such as The Gun Club, the Cramps, Suicide, the Stooges and Captain Beefheart.

The band was signed by Au Go Go Records, who released &quot;This Is My Happy Hour&quot;/&quot;Swampland&quot; (December 1982), the influential &quot;Blood Red River&quot; mini-LP (September 1983) and &quot;We Had Love&quot;/&quot;Clear Spot&quot; (December 1983).

By the end of 1983, the Scientists were one of the most popular Australian independent bands. Deciding to move on to new horizons, they left Australia and relocated to London in March 1984. In October 1984, the band supported the Gun Club on their European tour. Meanwhile, Au Go Go had issued the darker, harsher mini-album &quot;This Heart Doesn&#x27;t Run on Blood, This Heart Doesn&#x27;t Run on Love&quot; (September 1984).

The band released a 12&quot; EP, &quot;Demolition Derby&quot;, in Belgium in February 1985, and their first full overseas album Produced by The Fall and Birthday Party producer, Richard Mazda, &quot;You Get What You Deserve&quot;, in the UK in July 1985 on their manager&#x27;s Karbon label, followed by the &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;/&quot;If It&#x27;s The Last Thing I Do&quot; 7&quot; in September. Owing to contractual disputes with Au Go Go, different mixes of some tracks appeared in Australia as the mini-album &quot;Atom Bomb Baby&quot;, with the &quot;Atom Bomb Baby/Backwards Man&quot; 7&quot; and a compilation LP &quot;Heading For a Trauma&quot; (comprising &quot;Demolition Derby&quot; with rare, radio and live tracks) being released with it in July 1985.

Rixon left the band in February 1985 to be replaced by Phillip Hertz, who was replaced in December 1985 by Leanne Chock. The band signed a new deal with Big Time Records, who asked them to prepare a best-of compilation to introduce them to the market. The band rerecorded 11 of their songs with producer Richard Mazda as &quot;Weird Love&quot;, released in April 1986.

Sujdovic had to leave the UK after the recording due to visa problems, and was replaced by Joe Presedo of Silver Chapter. Presedo and Chock left in December 1986, Salmon shifted to bass and Nick Combe joined on drums. The Salmon/Thewlis/Combe lineup recorded the album &quot;Human Jukebox&quot; in December 1986.

This lineup returned to Australia in April 1987 for the Human Jukebox tour. Salmon moved back to Perth with his wife Linda Fearon (co-writer of &quot;Blood Red River&quot;) and son. &quot;Human Jukebox&quot; was released on Karbon in October 1987. The band toured Australia in November 1987, with a lineup of Salmon, Thewlis, Combe on drums and Rixon rejoining on bass. Their last show was at the Shenton Park Hotel in Perth on 27 November 1987.

===1987–2006: after the Scientists===
In Perth between the 1987 tours, Salmon formed Kim Salmon and the Surrealists with Brian Hooper on bass and Tony Pola on drums. He lived in Perth until the early 1990s, playing live solo, with the Surrealists or with &quot;Kim Salmon&#x27;s Human Jukebox&quot;, formed with Kim Williams and Pola to promote the 1991 Scientists compilation &quot;Absolute&quot;. He also played with the second incarnation of the Beasts of Bourbon from 1988 until 1993. Salmon&#x27;s music continued in a similar direction to his work with the Scientists.

After the Scientists, Thewlis formed the Interstellar Villains, exploring a musical direction much more rooted in &#x27;60s rock, psychedelia and surf music. He then joined Diggory Kenrick and Robert Coyne in Venus Ray, and later played with the Scoundrelles.

===2006–present: reformation===
In May 2006, the Scientists (with a line-up of Thewlis, Salmon, Sujdovic and Chock) were invited by Mudhoney to play at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in the UK. They also supported Mudhoney at a performance at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London on 11 May 2006. In 2007, a live recording of that performance, &quot;Sedition&quot;, was released on the ATP Recordings label. The same lineup played in London in April 2007 and at the ATP festival the same month. In February 2008, they supported Sonic Youth for their Australian Daydream Nation shows, performing the mini album &quot;Blood Red River&quot; in its entirety as part of the ATP-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series.

In September 2010, the group played their first ever U.S. show at the ATP New York music festival in Monticello, where they performed &quot;Blood Red River&quot; in its entirety.

In 2018 and 2019 the Scientists (with a line-up of Salmon, Cowie (née Chock), Sujdovic and Thewlis) toured in Europe and North America, and said that they would soon release a new recording.

In April 2021, the band confirmed the release of a new studio album titled &quot;Negativity&quot; scheduled for June 2021 and released single &quot;Outsiders&quot;. &quot;I Wasn&#x27;t Good at Picking Friends&quot; was released in May 2021.

The current line-up features singer-guitarist Kim Salmon, lead guitarist Tony Thewlis, drummer Leanne Cowie and bassist Boris Sujdovic. They toured Australia in 2022 promoting &quot;Negativity&quot;, and in 2023 in UK, Spain and Italy.

<doc id="506115" wikidata="Q2066298" url="?curid=506115" title="Thatcher effect">
<text>The Thatcher effect or Thatcher illusion is a phenomenon where it becomes more difficult to detect local feature changes in an upside-down face, despite identical changes being obvious in an upright face. It is named after the then British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, on whose photograph the effect was first demonstrated. The effect was originally created in 1980 by Peter Thompson, professor of psychology at the University of York.

== Overview ==
The effect is illustrated by two originally identical photos, which are inverted. The second picture is altered so that the eyes and mouth are vertically flipped, though the changes are not immediately obvious until the image is viewed upright.

The Thatcher effect is thought to be due to specific psychological cognitive modules involved in face perception which are tuned especially to upright faces. Faces seem unique despite the fact that they are very similar. It has been hypothesized that we develop specific processes to differentiate between faces that rely as much on the configuration (the structural relationship between individual features on the face) as the details of individual face features, such as the eyes, nose and mouth.

There is evidence that rhesus monkeys as well as chimpanzees experience the Thatcher effect, raising the possibility that some brain mechanisms involved in processing faces may have evolved in a common ancestor more than 30 million years ago.

The basic principles of the Thatcher effect in face perception have also been applied to biological motion. The local inversion of individual dots is hard, and in some cases, nearly impossible to recognize when the entire figure is inverted.

==Further investigations==

The Thatcher illusion has also been useful in revealing the psychology of face recognition. Typically, experiments using the Thatcher illusion look at the time required to see the inconsistent features either upright or inverted. Such measures have been used to determine the nature of the processing of holistic facial images.

By looking at the intermediate angles between upright and inverted, studies have explored the gradual or sudden appearance of the illusions. Sensitivity to the Thatcher illusion has been found in children, including children with autism.

However, people with congenital prosopagnosia have been shown to exhibit an overall much weaker response to the illusion compared to people without such condition. Their response time was shown to be weakly and linearly affected by the grotesque face&#x27;s orientation. This last observation suggests that the part of the brain responsible for &quot;configural processing&quot; in face recognition is the fusiform face area of the cortex, which is affected in both the congenital and the acquired condition.

<text>The lark bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys) is a medium-sized American sparrow native to central and western North America. It was designated the state bird of Colorado in 1931.

==Taxonomy==
The lark bunting is monotypic, the only member of the genus &quot;Calamospiza&quot;, and is not closely related to any other genera. It was first described by J. K. Townsend in 1837, from a specimen collected on a trip he took with Thomas Nuttall, under the name &quot;Fringilla bicolor&quot;. This is a preoccupied name, so Leonhard Hess Stejneger renamed the species in 1885 &quot;Calamospiza melanocorys&quot;. By then, the lark bunting had already been given its own genus, the one it is still placed in, by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1838.

==Description==

Lark buntings are small songbirds, with a short, thick, bluish bill. There is a large patch of white on the wings and they have a relatively short tail with white tips at the end of the feathers. Breeding males have an all black body with a large white patch on the upper part of the wing. Nonbreeding males and females look similar and are grayish brown with white stripes.

==Distribution and habitat==

The lark bunting is the most prevalent of the passerine species found in the grasslands of North America. Their breeding habitat is prairie regions in central Canada and the mid-western United States. These birds migrate in flocks to winter southern Texas, Arizona and the high plateau of northern Mexico in the fall.

==Behavior==

===Breeding===
The birds typically nest in dispersed colonies. Males fly up over their territory and sing while descending to declare ownership of a nesting territory. The song consists of a mix of whistles and trills. The call is a soft &quot;hoo&quot;.

The nest is an open cup on the ground in a grassy area.

While the lark buntings are socially monogamous, there is extensive extra-pair mating, observed through extra-pair paternity. In songbirds, it is suggested that social monogamy exists because of limited opportunities for polygyny. As expected, there is considerable aggression between males and between females, competing for mates. Many males are unable to find a social mate, which can be attributed to male-biased breeding sex ratio, social monogamy, and the frequency of extra-pair paternity. Acquisition of a social mate is an essential element of a male&#x27;s fitness, thus social mating success plays a significant role in variable selection of male traits.

Sexual selection in lark buntings is particularly interesting, as female mate choice is radically different from year to year. In different years, females show preference based on males&#x27; black coloring, size of wing patch, size of beak, as well as other characteristics. The consequence of this extreme variation of female choice from year to year is the maintenance of genetic variation in several different male sexual ornaments. A study measures body color, proportion of black versus brown feathers on rump and rest of body, wing patch size, wing patch color, body size, beak size, and residual mass, in order to evaluate the multiple characteristics potentially selected on by females. Social pairing success was measured as well as total annual fitness, finding female choice as the primary factor. Plasticity in female choice is favored for adapting to changes in ecological and social environments.

Temporal flexibility in female choice parallels the phenomenon seen in Darwin&#x27;s finches, with different beak sizes and shapes favored for changing food supply over years, defined as temporal selection in the context of natural selection. In lark buntings, a trait that is positively selected upon one year was likely negatively selected against in a previous year. These dramatic fluctuations highlight the importance of looking at sexual selection patterns over an extended period of time before drawing any conclusions. By looking at short time periods, however, it possible to identify female preference annually, however it is difficult to make any extrapolations for these assessments. An additional consequence of variation of female choice annually is the potential elimination of phenotypic selection for male trait exaggeration.

Males are characterized as weakly territorial prior to mating, however, there has been some evidence on territory features correlating with female settlement, thus female reproductive success. Studies have shown that shade is an important resource for female reproductive success. As a fitness-limiting feature, it would be reasonable to expect this could account for any existing tendencies for males being territorial. However, levels of male aggression do not change, which lends to the conclusion that female choice corresponds with changes in fitness-indicator traits. Extra-pair mating has been corresponded with nesting site quality, adding further characterization to male aggression. Many studies have shown territory characteristics being important for mate acquisition; however, a recent study shows evidence of its decreased role in comparison to female choice.

===Feeding===
Lark buntings primarily forage on the ground, mainly eating insects in summer and seeds in winter; they sometimes take short flights in pursuit of insects. Outside of the nesting season, they often feed in flocks.

==State bird==
The lark bunting has been the state bird of Colorado since 1931.

==Status==
There has been a decrease in population with the loss of natural prairie habitat.

<text>Out of Sight is a 1998 American action comedy film directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Scott Frank, adapted from Elmore Leonard&#x27;s 1996 novel. The first of several collaborations between Soderbergh and actor George Clooney, it was released on June 26, 1998.

The film stars Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, co-starring Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Dennis Farina, Nancy Allen, Steve Zahn, Catherine Keener, and Albert Brooks. There are also special appearances by Michael Keaton, briefly reprising his role as Ray Nicolette from Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; the previous year, and Samuel L. Jackson.

The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing. It won the Edgar Award for Best Screenplay and the National Society of Film Critics awards for Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. The film led to a short-lived spin-off television series in 2003 titled &quot;Karen Sisco&quot; starring Carla Gugino, who would reprise her role from the series in a 2012 third season episode of &quot;Justified.&quot; Paul Calderón reprised his role as Raymond Cruz from the film in the 2023 sequel miniseries &quot;&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;The movie intercuts between flashbacks and the present day. This plot summary follows the true chronology.&quot;

Career bank robber Jack Foley is incarcerated at Lompoc Penitentiary in California along with his friend and accomplice Buddy, after Buddy&#x27;s sister snitches on them before a heist. While at Lompoc, Foley meets Glenn—a nervous petty criminal who always wears sunglasses, even at night—as well as Richard Ripley, a wealthy white collar criminal from Detroit. Foley saves Ripley from being extorted by boxer Maurice &quot;Snoopy&quot; Miller, leading Ripley to promise Foley a job on the outside. He also brags about a cache of uncut diamonds hidden at his home.

After his release, Foley turns up at Ripley&#x27;s office but is only offered a menial security guard position. He confronts Ripley to complain, but Ripley only expresses disdain for Foley&#x27;s criminal past and throws him out of the building. As Foley walks away he notices a bank across the street, impulsively (and unsuccessfully) robs it, and is sent to Glades Correctional Institution in Florida.

At Glades, he deduces that fellow inmate Chino is orchestrating a breakout and plans to tag along. Foley calls his ex-wife Adele, an out-of-work magician&#x27;s assistant, to notify Buddy and Glenn to assist. However, on the night of the breakout U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco arrives at the prison at the same time as Buddy, spots the men tunneling outside, and alerts the guards. In the confusion, Foley exits the tunnel in a guard&#x27;s uniform and overpowers her. The men steal her car, and Foley forces her to hide with him in the trunk while Buddy drives. They meet Glenn to switch cars, but Sisco recognizes him from a previous prisoner transport job and convinces him to drive off with her to avoid being arrested again for assisting a fugitive. He later panics, crashes the car, and flees, while she is taken to hospital. Foley and Buddy make their own way to Miami.

Sisco has a dream where she tracks Foley down, but instead of arresting him they have sex. Determined to join the task force hunting the fugitives, she independently questions Adele and happens to arrest Chino, who arrives at her apartment seeking revenge on Foley. This earns her a place on the task force, but the lead agent forces her to wait in the lobby while they raid Buddy&#x27;s hotel room. She and Foley spot each other as he and Buddy escape via the basement garage; he waves at her, and she lets them go without alerting the other agents.

The men head to Detroit, planning to break into Ripley&#x27;s house and steal the diamonds. However, Miller is already putting his own burglary team together: his brother-in-law Kenneth, henchman White Boy Bob, and a reluctant Glenn, whom Miller first forces to help kill a rival drug dealer. Foley and Buddy meet with Miller and agree to team up on the robbery. Meanwhile Sisco, on their trail, questions Miller&#x27;s wife Moselle, and defends herself when Kenneth attempts to assault her. Foley surprises Sisco at her hotel&#x27;s bar, and they spend a romantic night together.

Glenn gets cold feet and runs into Sisco, who lets him escape, and she continues to tail Foley. The thieves break into Ripley&#x27;s mansion, threaten his housekeeper Midge, and struggle to shoot open the safe upstairs. Meanwhile, Foley and Buddy find Ripley hiding in his study, and the diamonds hidden in his fish tank. Ripley, in love with Midge, refuses to leave without her and is captured by Miller.

Unwilling to leave Midge to be raped by Miller and his associates, Foley gives Buddy the diamonds and goes back inside. He shoots Kenneth in bed, then is held at gunpoint by White Boy Bob, who trips on the stairs and accidentally shoots himself in the head. Sisco arrives and shoots Miller in self-defense. Unwilling to return to prison, Foley confronts Sisco with an empty gun, imploring her to kill him. Sisco instead shoots him in the leg and arrests him.

In the police van outside Foley meets another detainee, Hejira Henry, who claims to have escaped from prison nine times. Realizing that Sisco arranged for them to meet and go back to Glades together, Foley smiles knowingly as the van leaves for Florida.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
The source novel&#x27;s origins lie in a picture Leonard saw in the &quot;Detroit News&quot; of a beautiful young female federal marshal standing in front of a Miami courthouse with a shotgun resting on her hip. Producer Danny DeVito bought the rights to the book after his success with the 1995 film adaptation of Leonard&#x27;s novel &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. Steven Soderbergh had made two films for Universal Pictures when executive Casey Silver offered him &quot;Out of Sight&quot; with George Clooney attached. However, the filmmaker was close to making another project and hesitated to commit. Silver told him, &quot;These things aren&#x27;t going to line up very often, you should pay attention.&quot;

===Casting===
Sandra Bullock was originally considered to play Karen Sisco opposite Clooney. According to Soderbergh, &quot;What happened was I spent some time with [Clooney and Bullock] and they actually did have a great chemistry. But it was for the wrong movie. They really should do a movie together, but it was not Elmore Leonard energy.&quot;

The character of Foley appealed to Clooney, who as a boy had considered as heroes the bank robbers in movies, citing &quot;the Cagneys and the Bogarts, Steve McQueen and all those guys, the guys who were kind of bad and you still rooted for them. And when I read this, I thought, &#x27;This guy is robbing a bank but you really want him to get away with it.&#x27;&quot;

Soderbergh cites Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; as the primary influence on how he approached the love scene between Foley and Sisco: &quot;What I wanted to create in our movie was the intimacy of that, the juxtaposition of these two contrasting things ... We had to mix it up and have you feel like you were more in their heads.&quot;

Danny DeVito and Garry Shandling were considered for the part of Ripley before Albert Brooks was cast.

The character Ray Nicolette also appears in Leonard&#x27;s novel &quot;Rum Punch&quot;, which was being filmed as &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; when Universal Pictures was preparing to begin production on &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. After Michael Keaton was cast as the detective Nicolette in &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, Universal subsequently cast him for a cameo in the same role in &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. While Miramax Films owned the rights to the character because &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; went into production first, director Quentin Tarantino felt it was imperative that Miramax not charge Universal for using the character, allowing the character&#x27;s appearance without Miramax receiving financial compensation. Nicolette appears in only one brief scene, whereas the character is a much more substantial element of Jackie Brown.

===Music===
DJ David Holmes was originally hired to write a few sections of the film&#x27;s theme music. Soderbergh liked what he did so much that he had Holmes score the rest of the film. Holmes spent six weeks working 12- to 17-hour days to finish the score in time for the film&#x27;s release. He drew upon several influences, including Lalo Schifrin, Quincy Jones, Dean Martin, Miles Davis, Sun Ra, and Willie Bobo.

==Release==
&quot;Out of Sight&quot; was released on June 26, 1998, in 2,106 theaters and grossed USD 12 million on its opening weekend. It went on to gross $37.5 million domestically and $40.2 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $77.7 million.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Out of Sight&quot; received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 94% approval rating, based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s intelligently crafted adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel is witty, sexy, surprisingly entertaining, and a star-making turn for George Clooney.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars and praised Clooney&#x27;s performance, stating: &quot;Clooney has never been better. A lot of actors who are handsome when young need to put on some miles before the full flavor emerges ... Here Clooney at last looks like a big screen star; the good-looking leading man from television is over with.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Lopez&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;Ms. Lopez has her best movie role thus far, and she brings it both seductiveness and grit; if it was hard to imagine a hard-working, pistol-packing bombshell on the page, it couldn&#x27;t be easier here.&quot; Andrew Sarris, in his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, wrote, &quot;For once in a mainstream production, the narrative machinery works on all cylinders without any wasted motion or fatuous rhetoric. They don&#x27;t make movies like this anymore, in this overcalculated and overtested era.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan wrote, &quot;As always with the best of Leonard, it&#x27;s the journey, not the destination, that counts, and director Soderbergh has let it unfold with dry wit and great skill. Making adroit use of complex flashbacks, freeze frames and other stylistic flourishes, he&#x27;s managed to put his personal stamp on the film while staying faithful to the irreplaceable spirit of the original.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B+&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;This is Clooney&#x27;s wiliest, most complex star turn yet. It helps that he&#x27;s lost the Beverly Hills Caesar cut (he&#x27;s actually more handsome with his hair swept back), and his performance is slyly two-tiered: Foley is all charming moxie on the surface, a bit clueless underneath.&quot; Richard Schickel, in his review for &quot;Time&quot;, wrote, &quot;What makes this movie work is the kind of cool that made &quot;Get Shorty&quot; go so nicely: an understanding that life&#x27;s little adventures rarely come in neat three-act packages, the way most movies now do, and the unruffled presentation of outrageously twisted dialogue, characters and situations as if they were the most natural things in the world.&quot; In her review for the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;, Manohla Dargis wrote, &quot;This isn&#x27;t a profound film, or even an important one, but then it isn&#x27;t trying to be; it&#x27;s so diverting and so full of small, satisfying pleasures, you don&#x27;t realize how good it is until after it&#x27;s over.&quot;

===Accolades===
American Film Institute Lists
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated
* AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 – Nominated Gangster Film

Other Honors
* &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it as the sexiest film ever on their &quot;50 Sexiest Movies Ever&quot; poll and ranked it #9 on their Top 25 Modern Romances list.
* In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed &quot;Out of Sight&quot; as the 52nd best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.

===Impact and legacy===
In later years, Soderbergh would see the film as &quot;a very conscious decision on my part to try and climb my way out of the arthouse ghetto which can be as much of a trap as making blockbuster films.&quot; He had just turned down directing &quot;Human Nature&quot;, written by Charlie Kaufman, to direct &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. &quot;And I was very aware that at that point in my career, half the business was off limits to me.&quot; Clooney said, &quot;&quot;Out of Sight&quot; was the first time where I had a say, and it was the first good screenplay that I&#x27;d read where I just went, &#x27;That&#x27;s it.&#x27; And even though it didn&#x27;t do really well box office-wise - we sort of tanked again - it was a really good film.&quot; Lopez said: &quot;It kind of became a cult classic. It didn&#x27;t get as much notice when it first came out at the box office but now, years later, so many people told me that was their favorite film. It&#x27;s crazy.&quot;

<text>The Flathead Indian Reservation, located in western Montana on the Flathead River, is home to the Bitterroot Salish, Kootenai, and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles tribes – also known as the
Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation. The reservation, often referred to as the Flathead Nation, or simply Flathead or by its official acronym C.S.K.T., was created through the July 16, 1855, Treaty of Hellgate.

It has land in four of Montana&#x27;s counties: Lake, Sanders, Missoula, and Flathead, and controls most of Flathead Lake. The Flathead Indian Reservation, west of the Continental Divide, consists of () of forested mountains and valleys.

==Formation and land distribution==
Native Americans have lived in Montana for more than 12,000 years, based on archaeological findings. The &quot;Flathead&quot; Salish and Kalispel are the easternmost of the Salishan tribes, and are considered by tribal elders to be &quot;the head or parent tribe&quot; from which other Salishan groups dispersed downstream. Kootenai groups stretch north and west into what is now Idaho and Canada, with only the southeastern Ksanka band being primarily connected to the Flathead Reservation. The Kootenai left artifacts in prehistoric time. One group of the Kootenai in the northeast lived mainly on bison hunting. Another group lived on the rivers and lakes of the mountains in the west. When they moved east, they could rely less on salmon fishing, but turned to eating plants and bison. During the 18th century, the Salish and the Kootenai tribes shared gathering and hunting grounds. As European-American settlers entered the area, the different cultures of peoples came into conflict.

In 1855 the United States (US) made the Treaty of Hellgate, by which it set aside a reservation solely for use of the Flathead, encompassing an area including much of Flathead Lake. By the late 19th and early 20th century, the federal government had adopted a policy of allotting lands to individual Indian households from their communal holdings, in order to encourage subsistence farming and adoption of European-American ways.
Although the Flathead opposed such European-style allotments and farming, the US Congress passed the 1904 Flathead Allotment Act. Construction of the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project using the Mission Mountains as the water source was also authorized by Congress. Thousands of acres on the reservation were reserved for town sites, schools and the National Bison Range. The Flathead were given first choice of either of land per household.

According to their treaty, the tribes have the right to off-reservation hunting, but the state believed it could regulate those activities. State game wardens were responsible for a violent confrontation in 1908 with a small Pend d&#x27;Oreilles hunting party, which resulted in deaths of four of the Native Americans, in what is known as the Swan Valley Massacre. A court challenge to their hunting rights reached the US Supreme Court, which upheld tribal treaty rights to hunt off-reservation in their former territory.

After allotments of land to individual households of members on the tribal rolls, the government declared the rest of the communal land to be &quot;surplus&quot; and opened the reservation to homesteading for White settlement. United States Senator Joseph M. Dixon of Montana played a key role in getting this legislation passed. Most tribal members chose land close to the mountains where wild game still roamed, so prime farmland in the middle of the valleys was available. When it opened in 1910, 81,363 applications by whites were received for 1,600 parcels of land. Lottery winners took only 600 tracts, leaving 1,000 tracts still open. These were taken in what the tribe considers a subsequent &quot;land grab&quot;. The distribution of the lands caused much resentment by the Flathead as homesteaders started fencing the land, claiming water rights from streams and diverting water for irrigation. Congress amended the act to authorize the construction of irrigation systems for homesteaded lands within the reservation. The United States Reclamation Service began reconnaissance surveys in 1907 and actual work commenced in the summer of 1908. The tribes requested the establishment of the Pablo National Wildlife Refuge which was established in 1921, subject to reservoir uses for the irrigation project. The Tribes manage the fishery resources in the Pablo Reservoir. Originally a joint project, the Indian Service gained control of Flathead Irrigation Project in 1924. With the rugged mountains and valleys, numerous waterways diverse in size, and a large amount of natural lakes, the project was not completed until 1963.

==Management==
A tribal council was formed in response to the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. They were the first tribes to organize a tribal government under the act. Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, the tribal council was finally able to begin gradually taking over management of law enforcement, justice, forestry, wildlife, and health and human services programs. The Flathead have worked to regain control of the reservation lands and acquire some of the approximately one-half of the land base appropriated by non-Indians. The allotment of reservation lands remains &quot;a very sensitive issue&quot;.

The tribes applied to Congress and began managing the Mission Valley Power Company in 1988, which serves the reservation. Their bid to take over the federal operating license for Kerr Dam wasn&#x27;t successful, but the tribes obtained exclusive rights to purchase the facility in 2015, and a larger rent payment.

The Flathead Indian Irrigation Project had been operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) since they assumed management from the Bureau of Reclamation in 1993. It has 17 reservoirs, of canals and more than 10,000 structures. After seven years of technical work on issues that included rights-of-ways, treaty-protected fisheries, biological resources, wildlife habitat and Native American traditional and cultural properties and resources, the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project Cooperative Management Entity was formed in 2010. The cooperative was the result of negotiations between the Flathead Joint Board of Control which represents non-Indian irrigation interests in the Flathead, Mission and Jocko Valley irrigation districts and the tribes. While the federal government would retain ownership, this was the first management partnership where management was taken over from the BIA on an irrigation project. Under the Cooperative, some of the irrigators were concerned that the tribes had equal representation as non-tribal farmers and ranchers, who they claim own 90 percent of the project&#x27;s irrigable land. The use of the irrigation project by both Tribal and non-tribal members also complicated the nearly 2-decades-long-statewide effort to negotiate water rights settlements with all of Montana&#x27;s tribes. The 2013 Montana Legislature failed to pass the Flathead Water Rights Compact after 12 years of negotiations with the tribes by the Montana Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission. In 2014, the BIA resumed management of the irrigation project. In 2015, the tribes acquired the dam, renaming it as the Seli&#x27;š Ksanka Qlispe&#x27; Dam. They are the first tribe to own a hydroelectric dam. It generates hydroelectric power for the region. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes – Montana Compact was ratified by the Tribes on December 29, 2020. This water rights compact with the state and federal government, with an effective date of September 17, 2021, established a regulatory body composed of members appointed by both the State of Montana and CSKT as the authority for all water right permitting and changes within the Flathead Indian Reservation in perpetuity. The Montana Water Rights Protection Act, passed by Congress to approve the compact, provided funding to rebuild the Flathead Irrigation Project.

==Geography and ecology ==

All but the northern tip of Flathead Lake is part of the reservation. Flathead Lake lies in the northeast corner of the reservation, with most of the reservation to the south and west of the lake. Polson, the county seat of Lake County, is located at the southern end of the lake and within the reservation boundaries. The Flathead River flows south and west from Flathead Lake and exits in the southwestern corner of the reservation. Virtually all streams within the reservation are tributaries of the Flathead River. Mission Valley is centrally located within the reservation and surrounded on the eastern, western, and southern sides by mountain ranges.

Part of the Mission Mountains range is on the reservation. The western end of the range is protected by the Mission Mountains Tribal Wilderness and the eastern end of the range is protected by the Mission Mountains Wilderness. The southern end of the Mission Mountains includes a large grizzly bear protection area which is usually closed to hikers from July thru September. This allows the bears to feed on lady bugs and cut worms, and attempts to keep bear-human contact to a minimum.

The Natural Resource Department uses innovative management to restore and protect the habitat that supports a large variety of wildlife. The tribe prohibits hunting furbearing animals on the reservation. The tribe permits hunting by non-natives of the following birds: Hungarian partridge, pheasants, ducks, geese, mergansers, and coots. Other animals that can not be hunted by non-natives are: elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer, grizzly bear, and moose. Wolves, bison, swans, and falcons are also present.

Recent years have seen a decline in the numbers of native fish species, which include: bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout, northern whitefish, and northern pikeminnow. Non-native species include: yellowstone cutthroat trout, brook trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, lake trout, lake whitefish, black bullhead, kokanee salmon, yellow perch, northern pike, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.

===Wildfires===
At the beginning of August 2023, tribal, state and federal firefighters fought four lightning-sparked wildfires that burned more than .

==Demographics==
The total population of the reservation was 28,324 as of the 2010 census, an 8% increase over the 2000 census. Some 9,138 persons living there identified as Native American; a total of 19,221 identified as other racial groups, outnumbering tribal members by 2:1. The largest community on the reservation is the city of Polson, which is also the county seat of Lake County. The seat of government of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation is Pablo.

==Culture==
Bison play an important role in Native culture which includes a deep spiritual connection. The federal government sponsored a program of bison eradication during the Indian Wars which removed a vital food source from the Plains Indians diet, and ensuring easier relocation onto Indian reservations. The National Bison Range was established on May 23, 1908, out of a portion of the reservation when it was realized that the Bison were almost extinct. The initial herd for the range, obtained from local ranchers, were the same animals (or their direct descendants) that had previously flourished on the reservation after being gathered by tribal members. After more than a century of federal management and nearly two decades of negotiations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the site was restored to the tribes in 2022. U.S. Department of the Interior Assistant Secretary Tara Katuk Sweeney stated that &quot;The CSKT have strong and deep historical, geographic and cultural ties to the land and the bison, and their environmental professionals have been leaders in natural resources and wildlife management for many decades.&quot;

The tribe is teaching members to raise traditional vegetables with at least eight gardens on the reservation. Some of the vegetables are used in a soup that is delivered to tribal elders.

==Economy==

The tribes derive income from selling timber and from operating a variety of businesses: 
* Gray Wolf Peak casino in the south of the reservation between Arlee and Evaro, 
* &quot;KwaTaqNuk&quot; (&quot;where the water leaves the lake&quot;) resort and casino in Polson, 
* S&amp;K Technologies, a defense technology firm with its headquarters in St. Ignatius and five subsidiary companies in the US and Saudi Arabia,
* S&amp;K Electronics in Pablo, an electronics manufacturer established in 1984, 
* S&amp;K Holding, a leasing and financing firm,
* Salish Kootenai College, a tribally controlled college, has been established in Pablo. It offers two- and four-year degrees.

==Infrastructure ==
===Power===

Mission Valley Power Company serves the reservation. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation operate and maintain Mission Valley Power, a federally owned electricity provider.

The Seli&#x27;š Ksanka Qlispe&#x27; Dam, (formerly Kerr Dam, generates hydroelectric power for the region.

===Transportation===

U.S. Highway 93 is a busy route passing through the reservation with Missoula to the south and Glacier National Park and the Whitefish Mountain Resort to the north. Much of the heavily used route for commercial, recreational, and local traffic was undergoing a significant widening project. In 1997, the tribes entered negotiations with the Montana Department of Transportation over improvements to the through the reservation as the tribes were concerned that project would destroy wetlands, further fragment wildlife habitat, and kill more animals crossing the highway. With concern for the nearby designated wilderness and grizzly bear habitat in the Mission Mountains, an agreement with the state and the Federal Highway Administration was reached in December 2000. While the passing lanes, turning lanes, climbing lanes, and wider shoulders were intended to cut down on accidents, the project also included 41 fish and wildlife crossings with the most visible being &quot;Animals&#x27; Trail&quot;, a .

==Communities==
There are 26 places (including CDPs) on the reservation that are officially recognized by the Census Bureau. Only eight of them are majority Flathead. After the allotment and homesteading at the turn of the 20th century, white settlers gained ownership to about one-half of the land on the reservation. Since the late 20th century, the tribe has been steadily buying back the land over many years. The Flathead own about 2/3 of the land on the reservation.

<text>Sky were an English–Australian instrumental rock group that specialised in combining a variety of musical styles, most prominently rock, classical and jazz. The group&#x27;s original and best-known line-up featured two Australians - classical guitarist John Williams and electric guitarist Kevin Peek - alongside three Britons - bass player Herbie Flowers, drummer/percussionist Tristan Fry and keyboard player Francis Monkman.

==History==

===Roots and prehistory===

In 1971, John Williams released the fusion album &quot;Changes&quot;, his first recording of non-classical music and the first on which he played electric guitar. Among the musicians working on the album were Tristan Fry (an established session drummer who was also the timpanist for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, and had played Timpani on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;) and Herbie Flowers (a former member of Blue Mink and T. Rex, as well as a busy session musician who, among other things, had recorded the bassline for Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;).

The three musicians became friends, kept in touch and continued working together on various projects during the 1970s. One of these was Williams&#x27; 1978 album &quot;Travelling&quot;, another substantially commercially successful cross-genre recording. As well as Fry and Flowers, the record featured former Curved Air member Francis Monkman (who, in addition to his progressive and psychedelic rock background as guitar and synthesiser player, was a trained and accomplished classical harpsichordist). 

In 1979, Monkman performed on Louis Clark&#x27;s album &quot;(per-spek-tiv) n.&quot;, on which he collaborated with Australian session guitarist Kevin Peek. Peek was equally adept at classical guitar and pop/rock styles, having built a reputation both as a chamber musician and as a long-standing member of Cliff Richard&#x27;s band, as well as from working with Manfred Mann, Lulu, Tom Jones, Jeff Wayne, Shirley Bassey and Gary Glitter.

===First line-up, &quot;Sky&quot; and &quot;Sky 2&quot;: 1979–1980===

The success of &quot;Travelling&quot; inspired Williams and Flowers to set up Sky, their own long-term cross-genre band. The band name Sky was suggested by flautist Pinuccia Rossetti, a member of the Carlos Bonell Ensemble, and a friend of Williams. Fry and Monkman were swiftly recruited, with Kevin Peek being the final addition. The band began writing and recording instrumental music drawing on their collective experience of classical, light pop, progressive and psychedelic rock, light entertainment and jazz. After a protracted search for a record company, Sky signed with the small European label Ariola Records.

Although Sky was run democratically (with all members contributing music and/or arrangements), the presence of John Williams in the line-up was regarded as the band&#x27;s biggest selling point and was emphasised in publicity. Williams&#x27; concurrent solo instrumental hit – &quot;Cavatina – Theme from &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;&quot; – also helped to raise the band&#x27;s profile. However, this selling was counterbalanced by some negative reviews from critics accustomed to Williams&#x27; classical performances, who remained unimpressed by his new direction with Sky.

Sky&#x27;s self-titled debut album (released in 1979) was highly successful in Britain and Australia, quickly reaching gold record status and eventually topping out as a platinum record. The album featured versions of Eric Satie&#x27;s &quot;Gymnopedie No. 1&quot; and Antonio Ruiz-Pipò&#x27;s &quot;Danza&quot;, as well as original compositions by Monkman and Flowers. Monkman&#x27;s &#x27;Cannonball&#x27; was a minor hit single, and the keyboard player also contributed the twenty-minute second-side composition &quot;Where Opposites Meet&quot; (a piece remembered by Williams as &quot;an absolute masterpiece&quot;), which was intended to combine and display the band&#x27;s diverse influences. The band toured the UK in summer and autumn 1979, particular triumphs being sold-out concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and the Dominion Theatre in London (the latter a five-night sellout). In 2024, Williams recalled &quot;we&#x27;d really go places. We&#x27;d play the Apollo venues in London, Glasgow, and Manchester. Those were in areas you wouldn&#x27;t want to find yourself at two o’clock in the morning on your own. A lot of the audience were rough and ready, but with hearts of gold.&quot;

Sky managed to appeal to a surprising breadth of music fans, with Monkman recalling in 1999 that &quot;the audiences contained a greater variety of people than you would believe possible - leather-clad youth refusing to sit next to their parents, that sort of thing. Amazing!&quot;, while Fry would add in 2024 &quot;it was very mixed – we could get some lovely nuns as well as rockers.&quot; In 2024, Williams remembered &quot;Francis would play Padre Antonio Soler&#x27;s &#x27;Fandango in D minor&#x27; and it would go on for twelve minutes. The rock and roll audience at the Apollo in Glasgow would jump up and down and go wild with enthusiasm. Culturally, this was really important. You wouldn’t get them into a normal harpsichord recital at a small hall. It was because of this setting. [Kevin Peek] and I would also play some Praetorius sixteenth-century pieces — just for five or six minutes — and the audience would hear them in a way they’ve never heard them before.&quot; The band were also technologically ambitious, with Williams noting &quot;we were the first to combine acoustic and electronic instruments [in] the way we did. We coupled the harpsichord with a Fairlight CMI and Oberheim synths. So, when you played the harpsichord, it would have a half-organ sound with all the dynamics of the harpsichord.&quot; 

In 1980, Sky recorded and released their second album, &quot;Sky 2&quot;. This was a double album that built upon its predecessor&#x27;s success, becoming the tenth highest selling album in Britain that year. The album included Monkman&#x27;s side-long rock suite &quot;FIFO&quot; (a piece inspired by computer information processing techniques, stands for &quot;First In, First Out&quot;) and four classical pieces including three established chamber music pieces (played entirely straight) and the band&#x27;s souped-up electric treatment of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D Minor&quot;. The latter was released as a single (under the name &quot;Toccata&quot;) and reached number 5 in the national pop charts, giving the band the opportunity of performing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Other tracks included a Williams conflation of Spanish folk tunes, a Fry-penned tuned percussion piece, a cover of Curved Air&#x27;s &quot;Vivaldi&quot;, Peek&#x27;s Arabic-influenced &quot;Sahara&quot;, the psychedelic faux-Spanish folk dance &quot;Hotta&quot;, and several cheerful Flowers compositions including his tuba showcase &quot;Tuba Smarties&quot; and &quot;Scipio&quot; (which Flowers described as &quot;the first piece of music to have Parts I &amp; II running simultaneously&quot;, although an unimpressed Monkman would later claim that it had been &quot;motivated by a &#x27;look, anyone can write a long piece&#x27; attitude&quot; and refused &quot;point blank&quot; to ever play the piece live).

In 1980, the BBC produced the television series &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot; which included an episode set in Australia. The music for this programme was by Sky, featuring tracks from the first two albums.

Following further tours of Australia and the UK, Francis Monkman left the band in October 1980 to concentrate on his own projects (having scored success with his soundtrack to the film &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot;). Monkman had also become dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s direction, commenting later in 1999 &quot;all I can say is, there seemed to emerge (from where?) a need for Sky to re-invent itself, come the third album, as a &#x27;true&#x27; MOR outfit... So, clearly outvoted in the dash for mediocrity that the third album, for me, represents, I quit.&quot; In 2014, Fry recalled, ruefully, &quot;there was nothing personal as far as I know... one day he came in and said it wasn&#x27;t for him any more - not quite those words, but something like that.&quot; In the same interview, Flowers added, more pointedly, &quot;I think [he] felt a little bit that the music should all be completely original and serious... maybe by then the width of our material was too wide, you couldn&#x27;t pin us down, and I think Francis might have felt that it was beginning to take a bit too much time.&quot;

The remaining Sky members, however, had no doubts about carrying on despite the fact that Monkman had been Sky&#x27;s most prominent original composer and arranger.

===Second line-up, &quot;Sky 3&quot;, &quot;Sky 4: Forthcoming&quot;, &quot;Sky Five Live&quot; and &quot;Cadmium&quot;: 1980–1984===

Monkman was replaced as Sky&#x27;s keyboard player by Steve Gray. Like most of the other band members, Gray was an established session musician: he had previously played with Back Door, Quincy Jones, Henry Mancini, Michel Legrand, Lalo Schifrin, Peggy Lee, Sammy Davis Jr and John Barry. More recently, he had led WASP, a studio-based jazz-fusion band specialising in high-quality library music. Recalling Gray&#x27;s recruitment, Flowers asserted &quot;there aren&#x27;t many musicians to my mind with whom everything they play and everything they write is beautiful... but Steve Gray was,&quot; adding &quot;Steve was the gentlest of men, and when he rolled up it was just wonderful from the start.&quot; Gray&#x27;s jazz credentials also appealed to Flowers, who confessed to being &quot;an old jazzer&quot; at heart.

Despite Gray&#x27;s initial reluctance to return to playing live, he was persuaded to join the band in time for their first European tour. This was followed by another UK tour and (on 24 February 1981) the &quot;Sky at Westminster Abbey&quot; concert. A benefit show to commemorate the 20th anniversary of human rights organisation Amnesty International, the latter was conceived by British producer Martin Lewis and was the first-ever rock concert held at the abbey. The landmark event resulted in Sky receiving considerable positive media coverage: it was also videotaped for a BBC TV special and subsequently released on home video and laserdisc.

The Westminster Abbey concert was also the launch event for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Sky 3&quot;. A generally brighter and breezier album than its predecessors, the record demonstrated Steve Gray&#x27;s new and prominent compositional role within Sky, moving away from the harpsichord-orientated and psychedelic elements of the Monkman years and taking the band towards a more jazz-influenced sound. Flowers jokingly described the recording sessions as having been &quot;a lot of laughter with some music in between.&quot; Sky went on to tour Australia, Europe and the UK in support of the release.

The fourth Sky album, &quot;Sky 4: Forthcoming&quot;, was released in March 1982. Sky&#x27;s first album to feature no original material, it consisted predominantly of arrangements of classical compositions and was marketed under the slogan &quot;Genius Past, Genius Forthcoming&quot;. Flowers has spoken of having thought that &quot;John [Williams] needed to be considered more. Perhaps the other albums had got a little too rocky and the idea of this [one] was to slide us a little bit nearer to where we were all very comfortable... John was keen to do &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; by Bach.&quot; The band drew from a more diverse &quot;classical&quot; catalogue than might have been expected, with the pieces recorded varying from better-known classical/Romantic/Renaissance compositions (the aforementioned &quot;Fantasy&quot;, part of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot;, one of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Valses Nobles and Sentimentales&quot;, and a Mubarra fantasia) to assorted twentieth century works by Khatchaturian, Villa-Lobos and Theodorakis. Although the band did record a tongue-in-cheek, mock-pomp version of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, Flowers recalled the arrangements on the album as having been &quot;quite thorough... Doing an arrangement of another composer&#x27;s work, you have to pay deference to it.&quot; The record also featured a version of Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s 1940s pop hit &quot;Skylark&quot;, arranged by Gray and Williams to suit Williams&#x27; approach.

Once again, the band toured the UK and Australia to promote the album (and followed this up with trips to Europe and Japan), as well as recording a live-in-the-studio set for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Night Music&quot; series which was broadcast in July 1982. The Australian autumn tour featured the debut of plenty of new material, much of which was included on a live double album, &quot;Sky Five Live&quot;, released in January 1983.

Sky released their sixth album, &quot;Cadmium&quot;, in December 1983. The album contained a classical-rock arrangement of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; (from the &quot;Lieutenant Kijé Suite&quot;), alongside seven original compositions. It also featured the first examples of commissioned compositions from contemporary writers from outside the band: Alan Tarney (Kevin Peek&#x27;s old friend and fellow Cliff Richard collaborator) provided two further original tunes. Two concerts at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London were filmed and broadcast on Christmas Eve, 1983, with songwriter and singer-songwriter Patrick Ros as special guest. Ros provided three seasonal compositions of his own on which he was backed by the band.

Having previously hinted that his work with Sky had been intended as a five-year stint, John Williams parted company with the band in February 1984, returning to a full-time classical career. Having favoured the approach and results on Sky&#x27;s first two albums, in 2024 he would reflect on a certain dissatisfaction with the group&#x27;s direction and musical development, commenting &quot;when I think about the repertoire, I think about one-third to one-half of it was really good. But I think a lot of it, especially when I was leaving, was becoming a bit tame, like library music... [A lot of the] stuff was just entertainment. I don&#x27;t think many pieces transferred to a pure listening experience as a recording. They didn’t stand up that well. They&#x27;re okay, but they&#x27;re not great... For me, Sky was a question of being on stage and how I approached that... There were a lot of great things about Sky and the band did very good shows... For that generation of people in their twenties and thirties when we were doing Sky, I know it led a lot of people into the guitar. And in retrospect, I&#x27;m pretty proud of that.&quot;

&quot;John leaving was tragic in a way,&quot; Fry admitted in 2014, &quot;but the band was capable of standing on its own by then, and it did have a track record. So, we decided to carry on. We felt that there were things we still wanted to do and pursue. Ultimately we were still enjoying it all too much to give it all up just then.&quot;

===Third line-up, &quot;The Great Balloon Race&quot; and &quot;Mozart&quot;: 1984–1990===

Though Williams&#x27; departure had been amicable, his departure still came as a shock to Sky, since it happened just before the start of a scheduled, sold-out Australian tour. &quot;John leaving did put us in a spot,&quot; noted Flowers, in 2015, &quot;[but] we felt we couldn&#x27;t let people down.&quot; The band quickly recruited two guest members to fill in on tour - session guitarist Lee Fothergill (an accomplished all-round musician who had first met Tristan Fry as part of the house band for &#x27;The Val Doonican Show&#x27;) and woodwind/keyboard player Ron Aspery (Steve Gray&#x27;s former mentor in both Back Door and the Middlesbrough Municipal Junior Orchestra).

Both musicians joined the Sky live band at short notice and without much rehearsal, but used their quick-learning session player skills to excellent effect. Fry recalls Fothergill&#x27;s performances in particular as having been &quot;phenomenal... he was playing both John&#x27;s and Kevin&#x27;s parts - well, anyone would find it a little daunting, but Lee was just brilliant.&quot; In order to deal with potential audience disappointments at Williams&#x27; absence, since the guitarist had been considered to be Sky&#x27;s biggest star and live draw, Flowers formally announced the news of Williams&#x27; departure at each concert and offered a full ticket price refund for anyone who was disappointed. Fry recalls that nobody actually took up the offer. 

Fothergill and Aspery kept their guest player positions for Sky&#x27;s European tour later in 1984, with Flowers commenting later &quot;bringing in Ron and Lee broadened our horizons somewhat.&quot; While the duo were not eventually asked to join full-time, Sky also opted not to recruit a permanent replacement for Williams, remaining as a quartet with the option of including other musicians and instruments as desired. Despite the band&#x27;s ongoing collective efforts to present themselves as a partnership of equals, concerns over the commercial impact of Williams&#x27; departure remained, and Sky released a stopgap &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation called &quot;Masterpieces&quot; during 1984, released on mass-media label Telstar (and featuring a previously unreleased live version of the Beatles song &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;, performed as a classical guitar duet by Williams and Peek).

In September 1984, Sky began recording their seventh album, &quot;The Great Balloon Race&quot;, in Kevin Peek&#x27;s Tracks Studio in Western Australia. &quot;The Great Balloon Race&quot; was the first Sky album to feature entirely original material without any classical content, although two pieces (&quot;Allegro&quot; and &quot;Caldando&quot;) were strongly classically inspired. Guests included Aspery, Fothergill, pan-pipe player Adrian Brett and former Jeff Beck Band keyboard player Tony Hymas (who contributed the unusual semi-spoken album opener &quot;Desperate For Your Love&quot;, ultimately Flowers&#x27; favourite piece on the record). Flowers recalled &quot;we had the opportunity to use voice, brass and other things... which led onto a few adventurous experiments. It&#x27;s definitely the most varied of the Sky albums but I&#x27;m glad about that. It stopped us being bored. You have to stick your head out of the window sometimes and look for different things.&quot; During the mixing stage, the band learnt that they had been dropped by Ariola Records. The album was eventually released on Epic Records (coincidentally, also the label releasing John Williams&#x27; albums) in April 1985. 

During April and May 1985, Sky toured the UK to promote the record, again performing with guest players – Nicky Hopkins (better known as keyboard player for the Rolling Stones) and multi-instrumentalist Paul Hart (a former composer for the National Youth Jazz Orchestra who had also played with John Dankworth and Cleo Laine). Despite some favourable reviews, sales of &quot;The Great Balloon Race&quot; had been significantly lower than they had been for previous Sky recordings, and the tour saw the band playing to smaller audiences than on previous tours.

From mid-1985 to 1986, the members of Sky worked on other projects. Sky returned in 1987 with another Australian tour (titled &quot;A New Journey&quot;), this time featuring former Yes keyboard player Rick Wakeman in the guest musician slot.

For the rest of 1987, the core quartet worked on the &quot;Mozart&quot; album, which united the band with the orchestra of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. The project was initiated by Tristan Fry (due to his parallel work with both band and orchestra) and was inspired by the bicentenary of Mozart&#x27;s death. The album contained full orchestral performances of Mozart&#x27;s work with Sky incorporated into the arrangements (most of which were written by Steve Gray). The band and orchestra (with Paul Hart returning as guest musician) promoted the album with a one-off concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 1 November 1987. Although the album ultimately became Sky&#x27;s most successful album in the United States, &quot;Mozart&quot; was roundly panned and dismissed by the press and the band took another two years off. A second compilation album, &quot;Classic Sky&quot;, was released in 1990.

Former member Francis Monkman has claimed that &quot;in the late &#x27;80s, long after John Williams had left, it was suggested that I write another long piece [for Sky], in the manner of &#x27;Opposites&#x27; and &#x27;Fifo&#x27;. The first movement of this work (which I determined to call &#x27;Another Dish for the Roof&#x27;) exists in demo form... The other three movements were planned, but scarcely sketched.&quot;

===Fourth and fifth line-ups, and final years: 1990–1995===

When Sky returned to action in 1990, they had become a quintet again, having recruited Paul Hart as a full member. A skilled performer on a variety of instruments (including piano, keyboards, guitars, bass, mandolin, cello and violin), Hart had already proved his worth on the &quot;Great Balloon Race&quot; and &quot;Mozart&quot; concerts, broadening and reinforcing the band&#x27;s sound. In 2024, Flowers would suggest that the band&#x27;s first line-up change in 1981 had begun a process allowing the band&#x27;s music and membership to broaden significantly over subsequent years: &quot;when Steve [Gray] took over [on keyboards], that opened the door a bit for a little jazz lilt to the music... and that gave me a bit more authority to ask someone like Paul Hart – one of the world’s great jingle writers and violin players – to join.&quot;

The revived band played a one-off concert at the London Palladium on 24 June 1990, in part to promote the new &quot;Sky: Masterpieces&quot; compilation. Although the album did not contain any new recordings, the band were still creatively active. At the concert, new compositions by Paul Hart (&quot;Reverie&quot; and &quot;Praeludium&quot;) and Kevin Peek (&quot;Jehad&quot;) were premiered, alongside a revisiting of Francis Monkman&#x27;s &quot;Cannonball&quot; (from the debut Sky album) and &quot;Would You Say I&#x27;m In Love With You&quot;, a piece written by Herbie Flowers with his former Blue Mink colleague Roger Cook. The concert set was later recorded in the studio and also broadcast on television in 1991 as part of the &quot;Bedrock&quot; concert series on Central TV.

None of this work, however, made it to a studio-recorded album; and in 1991 Kevin Peek became the next member of the band to depart. Peek had been a full-time resident of Australia since 1982 and had become busy with multiple recording projects at Tracks Studio, all of which inhibited his practical ability to spend time in the UK working with Sky. Consequently, he no longer believed that he had enough time to commit to the band. Peek was replaced by classical/cross-discipline guitarist Richard Durrant (an associate of Herbie Flowers).

Durrant joined the band in time for a comeback concert in September 1992 at the Barbican in London. However, although Sky toured the UK again during spring 1993, they were playing notably smaller venues than they had in the 1980s. As gaps in band activity grew longer, and audiences shrank, the group&#x27;s remaining momentum was gradually lost. The last performance by Sky was at an RAF tribute concert in May 1995. Flowers has commented that &quot;the last two or three years were more for the sheer joy of being in that fantastic band. We were still filling out places but I think we knew it would fizzle out and we nipped it in the bud before it did.&quot;

Although the band never formally disbanded, Sky has never since returned to active recording and performance, with the increasing age of surviving members and the deaths of Steve Gray (in 2008), Kevin Peek (2013), Francis Monkman (2023) and Herbie Flowers (2024) making a band reunion unlikely. Despite this, Williams expressed interest in a possible reformation in 2016 with Fry adding in 2024 &quot;I don&#x27;t feel as though we took it as far as we could. It would be a bit difficult, but that’s not to say it wouldn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;d love to, and I know Herbie would too.&quot; In the same interview as Fry, Flowers commented &quot;it&#x27;s like when they ask, &#x27;Are Oasis going to do Glastonbury?&#x27; I think, &#x27;Bollocks!&#x27; ... Sky were great at the time, but we all change. If I heard something [of theirs] I&#x27;d be like, &#x27;Oh no, God, I didn&#x27;t realise it was that bad!&#x27;&quot;

===After Sky: individual careers===

After leaving Sky in 1980, Francis Monkman divided his time between experimental rock music, library music and classical music recordings of solo keyboard work (generally harpsichord or church organ). He died on 11 May 2023.

Following his own departure from Sky in 1984, John Williams continued his original career as one of the world&#x27;s leading classical guitarists. He would also commission two guitar concertos from other members of Sky, performing and recording Paul Hart&#x27;s &quot;Concerto For Guitar &amp; Jazz Orchestra&quot; with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra in 1987, and Steve Gray&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Concerto&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1989 (although the latter was not released on record until 1996).

After leaving Sky in 1991, Kevin Peek continued to work as a musician and producer in Australia. In his later years, he underwent two bankruptcies, the first of which resulted in a three-year prison sentence. In 2010, he was linked to a &quot;Ponzi&quot; style investment scheme. In November 2011, he was back in court, bailed on 227 charges of gaining benefit by fraud: a trial date was scheduled for 27 January 2012, but abandoned due to Peek&#x27;s ill health. He died in Perth, Western Australia, on 11 February 2013, from metastatic skin cancer.

Following Sky&#x27;s last known collaborative work in 1995, Steve Gray continued his career as a respected composer (which he had been carrying out in parallel to his work with Sky). His compositions include two operas, a requiem mass for jazz big band and choir, the guitar concerto for John Williams and the LSO, and a piano concerto written for French jazz pianist Martial Solal. Gray also provided a full orchestration of the works of Brian Eno (in collaboration with the original composer). From 1991, he worked closely with the North German Radio (NDR) Big Band in Hamburg (at the invitation of singer and composer Norma Winstone) and from 1998 he worked as guest professor of composition and arrangement in the Hanns Eisler jazz department of Berlin Hochschule für Musik. Steve Gray died on 20 September 2008.

Post-Sky, Tristan Fry continued his work as a classical percussionist. He still works with the Orchestra of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, as well as the Tristan Fry Percussion Ensemble.

As well as branching out as a light entertainment raconteur, Herbie Flowers continued to work as a high-profile session musician and collaborated with Jools Holland, Clannad, Mike Hatchard and Paul McCartney. He also played in the band for the first live tour of Jeff Wayne&#x27;s &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; show (having performed on the original studio album) and again in 2018. He frequently collaborated with Sky&#x27;s final guitarist, Richard Durrant, on various musical projects (including a trio with former Gentle Giant drummer Malcolm Mortimore). He died on September 5th 2024.

Richard Durrant has continued to develop his own career as a classical guitarist, as well as composing film and television music and working as a record producer (notably for the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain). Durrant is also the founder of the acoustic record label LongMan Records.

Paul Hart went on to a career in film, television and commercial music and has written concert music for the London Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the King&#x27;s Singers. His &quot;Concerto for Classical Guitar and Jazz Orchestra&quot; was revived for performance in 2008 by the Towson University Jazz Orchestra and guitarist Michael Decker.

===Post-split releases and reissues===

In 1993, Arista reissued the band&#x27;s first five albums on CD, although cuts were made to certain albums to suit CD running times (a shorter edit of &quot;Scipio&quot; on &quot;Sky 2&quot; and the complete removal of the twenty-minute suite &quot;The Animals&quot; from &quot;Sky Five Live&quot;). [The complete &quot;Sky Five Live&quot;, with &quot;The Animals&quot;, was issued as a double CD on Esoldun, with four bonus tracks from the four earlier studio albums. These were &quot;Carillon&quot; (&quot;Sky&quot;, listed as &quot;Carillion&quot;), &quot;Toccata&quot; (&quot;Sky 2&quot;), &quot;Westwind&quot; (&quot;Sky 3&quot;) and &quot;Fantasia&quot; (&quot;Sky 4&quot;).

In 2001, the band began a reissue programme of their back catalogue on Sanctuary Records, beginning with the &quot;Anthology&quot; compilation album. After four years wait, Sky reissued their debut album on the label in 2005 (with &quot;Sky 2&quot; following on a different label, Castle Music). After this the reissues plan stalled (although occasional brief runs of the first two Sky albums would appear intermittently on small labels). It would be nine more years before a full Sky reissue programme was carried out properly.

In 2002, a live Sky album, &quot;Live in Nottingham&quot;, was released on Classic Rock Productions, drawing on the 1990 live-in-the-studio concert with the Peek/Flowers/Gray/Fry/Hart line-up, which had followed the band&#x27;s lone Palladium concert in the same year. 

In 2005, Quantum Leap Productions issued a live DVD, &quot;Live in Bremen&quot;, featuring the original Sky line-up and recorded at a German television show in either 1979 or 1980.

The entire Sky back catalogue was eventually reissued by Esoteric Recordings (a progressive-rock-friendly subsidiary of Cherry Red Records). On 27 October 2014, fully remastered versions of &quot;Sky&quot; and &quot;Sky 2&quot; were released as CD/DVD packages, each containing a DVD of Sky&#x27;s television appearances (in 1979 and 1980 respectively). Remastered versions of &quot;Sky 3&quot; and &quot;Sky 4: Forthcoming&quot; were released on 26 January 2015, each with new sleevenote essays and companion live DVDs (the former featuring a companion DVD of the &quot;Sky at Westminster Abbey&quot; concert, the latter featuring the band&#x27;s July 1982 live set for the BBC TV programme &quot;Night Music&quot;). Remastered versions of &quot;The Great Balloon Race&quot; and &quot;Mozart&quot; followed on 30 March 2015 (with new essays but no bonus DVDs). The reissue set was completed by 27 April 2015 release of the remastered &quot;Sky Five Live&quot; (as a double CD with new sleevenote essay and with &quot;The Animals&quot; restored to the running order) and &quot;Cadmium&quot; (as a double set with three bonus tracks, a new sleevenote essay and a DVD combining a previously unreleased BBC recording of Sky at Drury Lane and a rare performance of the piece &quot;Troika&quot; on the &quot;Val Doonican Show&quot; from December 1983).

In 2016, the band&#x27;s entire output was reissued on coloured vinyl.

<doc id="506138" wikidata="Q1393417" url="?curid=506138" title="Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari">
<text>Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari (; c. 838 – c. 870 CE; also given as 810–855 or 808–864 also 783–858), was a Persian Muslim scholar, physician and psychologist, who produced one of the first Islamic encyclopedia of medicine titled &quot;Firdaws al-Hikmah&quot; (&quot;Paradise of Wisdom&quot;). Ali ibn Sahl spoke Syriac and Greek, the two sources of the medical tradition of Antiquity which had been lost by medieval Europe, and transcribed in meticulous calligraphy. His most famous student was the physician and alchemist Abu Bakr al-Razi (). Al-Tabari wrote the first encyclopedic work on medicine. He lived for over 70 years and interacted with important figures of the time, such as Muslim caliphs, governors, and eminent scholars. Because of his family&#x27;s religious history, as well as his religious work, al-Tabarī was one of the most controversial scholars. He first discovered that pulmonary tuberculosis is contagious.

Outside the rational sciences, as a convert from Christianity to Islam he was also involved in interreligious polemics, writing two works critical of his former religion, &quot;al-Radd ´alā l-Nasārā&quot; (The Refutation of the Christians) and &quot;Kitāb al-dīn wa-l-dawla&quot; (The Book of Religion and Empire), both of which having been published by Brill in 2016 in a single book, &quot;The Polemical Works of ʿAlī al-Ṭabarī&quot;.

==Life==
Ali came from a Persian or Syriac family of Tabaristan Amol (hence &quot;al-Tabari&quot; – &quot;from Tabaristan&quot;). Hossein Nasr states that he was a convert to Islam from Zoroastrianism, however Sami K. Hamarneh and Franz Rosenthal state he was a convert from Christianity. His father Sahl ibn Bishr was a state official, highly educated and well respected member of the Syriac community.
Rabbān received his educational bases in the medical field, natural sciences, calligraphy, mathematics, philosophy and literature from his father Sahl.

The Abbasid caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim (833–842) took him into the service of the court, which he continued under al-Mutawakkil (847–861). Ali ibn Sahl was fluent in Syriac and Greek, the two sources for the medical tradition of antiquity, and versed in fine calligraphy.

== Works ==
Although few of his works are extant, al-Tabarī wrote twelve books. Most of them were about medicine. In addition to medicine, he was known as a scholar of philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.
# His &quot;Firdaws al-Hikmah&quot; (&quot;Paradise of Wisdom&quot;), which he wrote in Arabic called also &quot;al-Kunnash&quot; was a system of medicine in seven parts. He also translated it into Syriac, to give it wider usefulness. The information in &quot;Firdaws al-Hikmah&quot; has never entered common circulation in the West because it was not edited until the 20th century, when Mohammed Zubair Siddiqui assembled an edition using the five surviving partial manuscripts. There is still no English translation. A German translation by Alfred Siggel of the chapters on Indian medicine was published in 1951.
# &quot;Tuhfat al-Muluk&quot; (&quot;The King&#x27;s Present&quot;)
# a work on the proper use of food, drink, and medicines.
# &quot;Hafzh al-Sihhah&quot; (&quot;The Proper Care of Health&quot;), following Greek and Indian authorities.
# &quot;Kitab al-Ruqa&quot; (&quot;Book of Magic or Amulets&quot;)
# &quot;Kitab fi al-hijamah&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Cupping&quot;)
# &quot;Kitab fi Tartib al-&#x27;Ardhiyah&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Preparation of Food&quot;)

<doc id="506139" wikidata="Q1542768" url="?curid=506139" title="Koori">
<text>Koori (also spelt koorie, goori or goorie) is a demonym for Aboriginal Australians from a region that approximately corresponds to southern New South Wales and Victoria. The word derives from the Indigenous language Awabakal. For some people and groups, it has been described as a reclaiming of Indigenous language and culture, as opposed to relying on European titles such as &quot;Aboriginal&quot;. The term is also used with reference to institutions involving Koori communities and individuals, such as the Koori Court, Koori Radio and Koori Knockout.

The Koori region is home to the largest proportion of Australia&#x27;s Indigenous population (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people), with 40.7% of Indigenous Australians living in either New South Wales or Victoria. Within the region however, Koori-identifying people make up only 2.9% and 0.8% of the overall populations of New South Wales and Victoria respectively. Most of this Koori population speak English in the home, although a small number do report continued usage of traditional Indigenous languages.

Koori culture is characterised by a commitment to the Dreaming, an overall worldview that believes in and values interconnectedness between the land and community. Koori art and literature continue to be produced in contemporary Australia, often with reference to traditional Indigenous artistic techniques.

The first recorded meeting between Koori people and Europeans occurred in 1770. Kooris have since experienced a sharp population decline, influenced by the colonisation of Australia by Europeans. The legacy of colonisation is still strongly felt, and has had ongoing ramifications for Koori life and wellbeing.

==Etymology==

&quot;Koori&quot; comes from the word , meaning &quot;man&quot; or &quot;people&quot; in the Indigenous language Awabakal, spoken on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. On the far north coast of New South Wales, the term may still be spelt &quot;goori&quot; or &quot;goorie&quot; and pronounced with a harder &quot;g&quot;. The term&#x27;s first documented usage occurred in 1834 in &quot;An Australian Grammar&quot; as &quot;Ko-re&quot;, translated to mean man or mankind.

== Geography and subgroups ==
Koori Indigenous Australians inhabit the broad region of southern New South Wales and Victoria. Indigenous subgroups within this region are numerous, including the Eora nation of modern-day Sydney, Ngunnawal nation of Canberra and Woiwurrung nation of Melbourne.

== Knowledge and culture ==
=== Art ===
Like archetypal Indigenous painting, Koori painting is based largely on dot work, done in &quot;earthy colours&quot; such as blacks, whites, reds and browns. Some Koori elders identify this style as a means of reconnecting with traditional Indigenous culture and ancestry.
More unique to the Koori population is the prevalence of artistic &quot;shell craft&quot;, using shells found in the coastal environment to decorate ornamental pieces. Documents from the 1880s detail Koori women selling shell craft baskets and decorative shoes to settler women at markets in La Perouse and Circular Quay, a practice that appears unique to the Sydney area.

Shell craft has continued to be of importance to the modern Koori population, with a 2008 exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney incorporating Indigenous shell craft. In 2005, Koori shell artist Esme Timbery won the Parliament of New South Wales Indigenous Art Prize for her shell-adorned model of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The economic prevalence of Koori shell craft, too, has increased in contemporary Indigenous art history. While in 2005, shell craft shoes retailed for approximately AUD$20, a pair sold for AUD$140 at a Sydney gallery in 2009.

Also unique to the Koori region were possum-skin cloaks, traditionally gifted to Koori newborns. The cloaks were embellished with the markings of the newborn&#x27;s clan and family, and were added to as the child grew, to represent a kind of Koori &quot;autobiography&quot;. Although the craft of possum-skin cloaks has declined, it is being revived by contemporary Koori artists such as Kelly Koumalatsos.

=== Language ===
The Koori region is home to a number of traditional Indigenous languages. The state of Victoria has speakers of 38 Aboriginal languages, while New South Wales has historically been home to more than 70. However, the number of Kooris who report speaking an Indigenous language at home is low. Only 0.8% of New South Wales and 1% of Victorian Kooris speak an Indigenous language in the home, being the lowest rates of Indigenous language usage outside of Tasmania.

There are some attempts to revive Koori languages. In New South Wales, the number of Koori families speaking an Indigenous language at home is on the rise. Census data indicates that the number of New South Wales Indigenous language speakers increased by 123% between 2006 and 2016. The New South Wales Government&#x27;s Aboriginal Languages Act was enacted in 2017 in an attempt to preserve Indigenous languages.

In addition to traditional languages, Kooris may also speak &quot;Koori English&quot;, the dialect of English spoken by Kooris within their communities. The dialect developed from the pidgin English used by Kooris to communicate with settlers at the time of colonisation. It employs nonverbal language cues such as silences, gestures and lip pursing. Some grammatical elements of Koori English may persist from traditional Indigenous languages, such as distinct ways of marking plural nouns.

=== Birthing rituals ===
Historical records show Koori birthing rituals involving song, dance and ceremonial practices. Gunditjmara Kooris of south west Victoria record the ritualistic use of sand, heated by fire both to warm the infant and welcome it to country. Records also exist detailing Koori use of medical techniques such as natural pain management, and the teaching of these techniques to European settler women.

Historically, &quot;birthing trees&quot; were essential to Koori birthing rituals. These were trees used as the sites of births, where mothers, families and communities could congregate to deliver the baby and welcome it to country. Sometimes, the placenta would be buried under the birthing tree to symbolise the newborn&#x27;s connection to country. A Koori birthing tree in Western Victoria has received status as a significant tree on the Australian Register of the National Trust in recognition of its importance to the Koori population.

== History ==
=== Before European colonisation ===
Radiocarbon dating has identified evidence of Indigenous inhabitancy in the Koori region as early as 50,000–45,000 years ago. Ancient Koori artefacts including human remains and tools have been found at Lake Mungo in New South Wales, dated to be between 50,000 and 46,000 years old.

In Western Victoria, structures from ancient Koori populations have been discovered, including stone-walled fishing traps measuring up to six metres in height and three kilometres in length. The traps date to approximately 6,600 years old, making them one of the world&#x27;s oldest known fish-trapping system. Similarly aged &quot;village&quot; sites have been found in South-Eastern Victoria, featuring wooden structures, garden areas and agricultural wetlands.

In New South Wales, small tools used for processing plants and hunting have been discovered to be approximately 10,000 years old. Fishhooks appear to have been widely used across the Koori coastline as early as 1000 years ago. These fishhooks appear to originate from outside of Australia, possibly from the Torres Strait or Polynesia, indicating a system of regional trade.

=== Early contact ===
The first documented contact between Indigenous Australians and Europeans on Koori territory occurred in 1770 during James Cook&#x27;s HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; expedition. In his journals, Cook documents interactions with Indigenous groups at Botany Bay near modern-day Sydney. During this initial contact, two Indigenous men resisted Cook&#x27;s landing, causing Cook to open fire and wound one of the men. &quot;Endeavour&quot; remained docked in the bay for the subsequent seven days, meaning that interactions between the explorers and Indigenous Kooris were conducted from a distance.

Koori material culture was observed, such as the use of watercraft, weaponry and tools, but there was little European documentation of Koori religious and cultural life during this voyage. The Indigenous groups of Botany Bay did not accept Cook&#x27;s trade offerings and resisted farther encroachment of the explorers onto Koori territory.

=== European colonisation and population decline ===
Following this initial contact, Great Britain established a penal colony at Botany Bay in New South Wales. The first settlers of this colony arrived in 1788 aboard the First Fleet, beginning the official colonisation of Australia by Europeans.

Over the century following colonisation, there occurred a steep decline in the Aboriginal population. Approximations of overall Indigenous population decline range from 80 to 96%, with estimates of around 80% in the Koori region in the first 20 years of contact.

Generally accepted estimates approximate that 2000 non-Aboriginals (mostly Europeans) and 20,000 Aboriginals were killed in armed conflict between the two groups. This included the Waterloo Creek massacre on New South Wales Koori territory in 1837, during which an estimated 200–300 Kooris were killed. In the 1830s and 40s, the Western District of Victoria was recorded as one of the two worst regions for violence. Sexual violence also occurred, particularly towards Koori women and children, sometimes resulting in death or infertility.

Many Kooris also died from epidemics of European diseases to which they had no tolerance. In 1791, all but two of the Koori inhabitants of inner Sydney died of smallpox or chickenpox. Another smallpox epidemic affected the New South Wales and Victoria regions in 1830. Deaths also occurred due to sexually transmitted infections, transported to Australia by the settlers. In Port Phillip, Victoria, two-thirds of the Koori population died of sexually transmitted infections.

=== 20th century ===
The Aborigines Protection Board of New South Wales and Victoria enabled the segregation of Kooris onto government-run missions and reserves. In the 1910s, the Board&#x27;s powers were extended to allow for the removal of Koori children from their families for assimilation into the non-Indigenous population. Some Koori children were placed into white families, while others were sent to labour schools such as the Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls and Kinchela Aboriginal Boys&#x27; Training Home. This process of segregation and child-removal was common throughout Australia and became known as the Stolen Generations.

In 1937, New South Wales Koori activist William Ferguson founded the Aborigines Progressive Association in Sydney to protest the oppression of the Aborigines Protection Board. Approximately 1000 Indigenous Australians attended the organisation&#x27;s first rally in Sydney on 26 January 1938.

From the 1970s, the policies of segregation and assimilation began to shift. New South Wales adopted the Aboriginal Child Placement Principle in 1987, mandating that an Indigenous family be chosen for the rehoming of Koori children wherever possible. In 1997, the premiers of both New South Wales and Victoria apologised for the historic mistreatment of Indigenous Australians, including an apology for the Stolen Generation, and affirmed their commitment to reconciliation.

== Current issues ==
Statistics indicate ongoing divergences between Koori and non-Koori Australians in areas such as health, education, income levels, and incarceration rates. The Australian National University&#x27;s Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research ties these statistical divergences to the Indigenous experience of colonialism.

=== Health ===
Statistics show that Koori Australians have poorer health than their non-Koori counterparts, reflected in their lower life expectancy. Across New South Wales and Victoria, non-Koori individuals were expected to live 8–10 years longer than Koori individuals between 2015 and 2017. Thus, the Koori population is younger in demographic, with the median age of the New South Wales Koori community being 22, in contrast to 38 for the non-Koori population.

In New South Wales, 7.6% of the Indigenous population are profoundly or severely disabled, compared to 5.6% of non-Indigenous individuals, and this gap is widening. Additionally, New South Wales Kooris with a disability tend to be younger: 36% of the Indigenous disabled population in New South Wales is under 25, compared to 12.7% of the non-Indigenous.

=== Education ===
Koori Australians also have lower levels of education than their non-Koori counterparts. In New South Wales, Koori children are half as likely to have completed secondary school. In Victoria, only 56.5% of Koori 25–34 year olds have some form of tertiary education, compared to 74.9% of non-Koori individuals.

=== Income ===
Koori Australians are more likely to be living below or near the poverty line. Approximately 32.4% of Koori households in New South Wales earn below A$500/week, compared to 22.3% of non-Indigenous. Less than half of New South Wales Kooris own their homes, compared to 70% of non-Koori residents.

New South Wales Kooris are less likely to be in the labour force, with an underemployment rate of 43% compared to 35.9% of non-Koori residents. The professional services industry has the highest divergence, with non-Koori employees three times as likely to work in this sector.

=== Incarceration rates ===
Koori Australians are more likely to be incarcerated in both New South Wales and Victoria. In 2019, Koori adults were 9.3 times more likely to be incarcerated in New South Wales than their non-Koori counterparts. In Victoria, they were 14.5 times more likely.

These statistics are mirrored in youth detention. In New South Wales, Koori children aged 10–17 were sixteen times more likely to be in detention on an average day in 2018 and 2019. In Victoria, they were 10 times as likely.

=== Government initiatives ===
New South Wales and Victoria have both introduced initiatives to address these divergences between Koori and non-Koori individuals. In March 2019, both states established a formal partnership with the Australian Federal Government to address the goals of the Closing the Gap initiative. The partnership also includes representatives from Indigenous activist groups.

==Koori Courts==

A Koori Court is a division of the Magistrates&#x27; Court of Victoria that sentences Indigenous Australians who plead guilty, operational since 2002.

New South Wales has several Youth Koori Courts, the first of which was established in Parramatta in 2015.

==Koori Radio==

Koori Radio, a community radio-station based in Redfern, broadcasts to Sydney on a citywide licence. It forms part of the Gadigal Information Service and is the only radio station in Sydney providing full-time broadcasting to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.

== &quot;Koori Mail&quot; ==

<text>Pirbright () is a village in Surrey, England. Pirbright is in the borough of Guildford and has a civil parish council covering the traditional boundaries of the area. Pirbright contains one buffered sub-locality, Stanford Common near the nation&#x27;s farm animal disease research institute. The village&#x27;s grade II* listed medieval church has a large Boulder grave for explorer Henry Morton Stanley. The nearby section of Hodge Brook is also known as the Congo Stream, between Ruwenzori Hills and Stanley Pool.

==Geography==

Pirbright has two communities: army training barracks and designated homes are north of a London main axis (south-west) railway and the slightly dispersed village is south. The village is almost entirely surrounded by heathland, much of it owned by the Ministry of Defence and used by the Army Training Centre Pirbright. The south and south-east of the parish is mostly woodland and has three small farms. The south-west of the parish has a large military training area, Pirbright Common. Near to the church are several features due to Stanley&#x27;s association with the village: Hodge Brook is equally marked as Congo Stream, between Ruwenzori Hill and Stanley Hill. Mazamboni Farm is next to Aruwimi Wood.

==History==

===Name===
Its name had three medieval variants (each involving the letter &#x27;f&#x27; where there is currently a &#x27;b&#x27;). It came from Anglo-Saxon (Old English) &quot;Pirige-fyrhþ&quot; = &quot;sparse woodland where peartrees grow&quot;.

===Medieval and Tudor periods===
The manor of Pirbright does not seem to occur earlier than the 13th century, when it was reported to be held of the honour of Clare by Peter de Pirbright. John Trenchard died seised of it (holding) under the Earl of Gloucester in 1301–2. In this time it had a medieval deer park, disparked under Richard II. During the reign of Henry VIII the manor changed hands several times: it formed part of the marriage portion of Queen Katharine of Aragon and was successively in the possession of Sir Thomas Boleyn and Sir William Fitz William. Finally it was granted to Sir Anthony Browne, afterwards Viscount Montagu, with whose family it remained until the middle of the next century.

===18th century and afterwards===
The locality saw development in the form of brick labourers&#x27; cottages with a few Georgian large homes, some with modest estates of land. Of the last sort, Vice-Admiral the Hon. John &quot;Foulweather Jack&quot; Byron, explorer, grandfather of George Gordon Byron, 6th Lord Byron (usually known as &#x27;the poet, Lord Byron&#x27;) planted in the late 18th century an avenue of Scotch pines to the foot of a tower hill, Crown Prince Hill, in the woods, still called Admiral&#x27;s Walk or &#x27;road&#x27;, which extends for , half within the Danger Area owned by the Ministry of Defence of Pirbright Common.

Heatherside was the early 20th century home of F. C. Selous, the African big-game hunter, and contained a &quot;remarkable collection of hunting spoils and native African curiosities.&quot;

Pirbright&#x27;s traditional churchyard contains the large block of granite, 11-feet high, marking the grave of British Empire soldier and explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who died in London aged 63. This is partly inscribed with the words &quot;Henry Morton Stanley Bula Matari 1841–1904 Africa&quot;. Bula Matari was another of his names and translates as &quot;Breaker of Rocks&quot; or &quot;Breakstones&quot; in Kongo.

A large fire occurred in the area in April 2022.

==Pirbright Institute==
The Pirbright Institute is a research establishment, based at Pirbright, that investigates diseases in farm animals. (A second site at Compton, Berkshire was closed in 2016 with research being transferred to the Pirbright site.) It is one of eight UK research institutes supported by the UK&#x27;s Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The Pirbright site includes international reference laboratories for the diagnosis of livestock diseases exotic to the UK, including the World Reference Laboratory for foot and mouth disease. The site also conducts research on viruses including foot and mouth disease and bluetongue virus.

On Saturday 4 August 2007 it was announced that the strain of foot-and-mouth disease detected in cattle three miles (5 km) away was similar to that in use at the Pirbright site. Professor Brian Spratt&#x27;s report found that more likely than not the strain of the virus understandably came from the Merial vaccine production facility or the Pirbright Institute laboratory: whose shared &quot;effluent pipes [leading to final small treatment plant were] not contained, as they should be as part of Category 4 containment at Pirbright.&quot; This poor condition of pipes and incursion of trees in the site has since been rectified and significant investment (over £170 million) is taking place at Pirbright to provide new laboratory and animal facilities.

==Education==
There are three schools in Pirbright, including two on School Lane, and a small all-through school, Knowl Hill School, for children with dyslexia which provides education for around fifty pupils. The largest school is the centrally located Pirbright Village Primary School, which educates children from the age of 4 to 11.

===Youth outreach===
The Normandy Youth Centre serves the wider area by sponsoring community-based programmes targeting youth in the area for the purpose of increasing exposure to educational opportunities and building a stronger community.

==Landmarks==
===Church of St Michael and All Angels===

The small church stands by Church Cottage in the meadows directly west of the village centre. It is built of brick dressings to a galleted &#x27;heathstone&#x27; walls to its Nave, with a galleted heathstone tower to west and chancel to east. Plain tiled roof with lead spike over tower. Box nave with square tower to west, gabled porch to south, aisle to north, chancel to east with vestry to north and organ bay to south.

===Moated &#x27;manor house&#x27; which held the manorial courts===
The manorial courthouse was renamed in the 19th century and has a moat, and a great proportion of the building was built in the 16th century, is timber-framed however the building is partially clad in red and blue brick and in brown and red brick on its non-timber framed cross wing.

==Sport==

Cricket has been played on the village green since 1780. The principal cricket club is Pirbright Cricket Club which has a 1st XI, and a Sunday team.

Pirbright is the home of Pirbright Tennis Club which was formed in 1976. Initially playing in the Burrow Hill part of the village, the club soon moved to its ground on School Lane. Pirbright Tennis Club has over 300 members and five adult teams; the courts are also used by students from the local schools.

<text>The Brahui (), Brahvi, or Brohi are an ethnolinguistic group of pastoralists principally found in Pakistan, and to a smaller extent in Afghanistan and Iran. They speak Brahui, which belongs to the Dravidian language family.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;Brahui&quot; is uncertain. Mikhail Andronov hypothesised a derivation from Dravidian (lit. Northern hillmen). However, Josef Elfenbein found it unconvincing and hypothesised a derivation from Saraiki (Jaṭki) &quot;brāhō&quot;, referring to the prophet &quot;Abraham&quot;; the term perhaps served to distinguish the neo-Muslim nomadic pastoralists — who had migrated into Sindh from the Western Deccan ago and adopted Islam.

==Origins==
The origins of the Brahuis remain unclear. Brahui lore, which speaks of a migration from Syria to Kalat followed by the overthrow of one Sewa dynasty, is a piecemeal borrowing from Baloch traditions; historical ballads, etc., are nonexistent in the language. Thus, says Elfenbein, reconstructions of Brahui pre-history can only depend on linguistics and genetics.

It is often suggested that the Brahui migrated from father south, similar to there closely related linguistic relatives, the Kurukh and Malto. Noting extensive phonological similarities with Malto and Kurukh, Dravidian languages spoken as geographical isolates across Eastern India, most linguists speculate the three groups to have shared a common stage before migrating along different directions. Sound changes shared with Kurukh and Malto also suggest that Brahui was originally spoken near them. The absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western Iranian language like Kurdish, and arrived in the area from the west only around 1000 CE.

Additionally, both Kurukhs and Maltos speak of an eastward migration from Karnataka in their lore, and Brahuis&#x27; self-identification as migrants from Syria can be interpreted as a distorted version of the same event. However, the Brahuis do not have any significant Dravidian genetic component and are largely indistinguishable from surrounding Indo-European populaces; this suggests the passage of sufficient time since the admixture event, thereby supporting the relict hypothesis. Asko Parpola states in his book &quot;Deciphering the Indus Script&quot; that the Brahui people are remnants of the Harappan culture, the language of which he concludes as &quot;likely to have belonged to the Dravidian family&quot;.

==History==
The Brahuis have traditionally been nomads; the state-formation — in the form of a confederacy, the Khanate of Kalat — appears to have been a response to the increasing penetration of Mughal governance, especially under Shah Jahan, into their traditional grazing lands and migratory routes. The Khanate was established by Ahmad Khan I, a Brahui chieftain, in the 1660s and derived its power from a complex system of inter-tribal alliances with the Balochs and Dehwaris; notwithstanding nominal suzerainties to Persia and Afghanistan at times, the kingdom gained in size and reached its zenith under Nasir Khan I in the late eighteenth century. However, British incursion into the subcontinent coupled with territorial losses to Persia compelled Kalat to accept a protectorate status; in the aftermath of the Partition, the Khanate was absorbed into Pakistan notwithstanding popular protests.

==Language and literature==
According to Elfenbein, only about 15% of the Brahui tribesmen are primary speakers of the Brahui language; only two nuclear tribes speak Brahui as a primary language. Half of the rest may be secondary speakers of Brahui with Balochi as the primary language, while the other half are estimated to speak no Brahui &quot;at all&quot;. The language belongs to the Dravidian language family and is, hence, a geographical isolate. It has extensively borrowed from Balochi and other languages of the area; linguist David W. McAlpin characterised it as an &quot;etymological nightmare&quot;. There are three dialects with no significant variation: Sarawani (spoken in the north), Jhalawani (spoken in the southeast), and Chaghi (spoken in the northwest and west).

No significant corpus of Brahui literature exists; the earliest extant work is &quot;Tuḥfat al-aja īb&quot; (lit. Gift of Wonders), a translation from Persian by Malikdad Gharsin Qalati, , a court poet of Nasir Khan I. The Perso-Arabic script currently in use was developed out of the efforts of Mulla Nabo-Jan and Maulana Fazl Mohammed Khan Darkhani for spreading Islamic revivalist ideas. Literacy rates among Brahuis remained very low as the late as 1990s.

==Geographic distribution==

===Pakistan===
The Brahuis predominantly inhabit a narrow belt in Pakistan, also known as Brahuistan, from Quetta in the north through Mastung, Kalat, and Nushki to Las Bela in the south. Kalat separates the area into a northern part, known as Sarawan, and a southern part, known as Jhalawan.
===Other countries===
Large numbers of nomadic and semi-nomadic Brahui speakers are found in Afghanistan, primarily in the Shorawak desert, in an area extending west of Nushki along the Helmand river into Iranian Sistan. In Iran, Brahui are restricted to the north of Sistan; in 1909, G. P. Tate did come across a few Brahui as far south as Khash, but they appear to have assimilated into the neighbouring Baloch. Some Brahui are also found in Turkmenistan, mainly in the Merv oasis, where their ancestors migrated from British India in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in search of employment.

===Tribes and population===
The number of Brahui tribes have fluctuated across the centuries. At the time of Nasir Khan I, when the Khanate of Kalat was at its zenith, the Brahuis had eight nuclear tribes and seven peripheral tribes; by the time of the last Khan, twelve peripheral tribes had been added. The 1911 census was the only attempt to enumerate the Brahui as an ethnic group. However, since most Brahui describe themselves as Baloch to outsiders, the recorded count is an underestimate. Elfenbein, referencing estimations from 1996, speculates that there are Brahui tribesmen. The 2023 Census of Pakistan enumerated 2.78 million Brahui-speakers across Pakistan.

<text>Celtic Park (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Pàirc Cheilteach&quot;) is a football stadium and the home of Scottish Premiership team Celtic Football Club, in the Parkhead area of Glasgow, Scotland. With a capacity of 60,832, it is the largest football stadium in Scotland, and the eighth-largest stadium in the United Kingdom. It is also known as Parkhead or Paradise.

Celtic was formed in 1887 and the first Celtic Park opened in Parkhead in 1888. The club moved to the current site in 1892, after the rental charge was greatly increased on the first. The new site was developed into an oval-shaped stadium, with vast terracing sections. The record attendance of 83,500 was set at an Old Firm derby on 1 January 1938. The terraces were covered and floodlights installed between 1957 and 1971. The Taylor Report mandated that major clubs should have all-seater stadia by August 1994. Celtic was in a poor financial position in the early 1990s and no major work was carried out until Fergus McCann took control of the club in March 1994. The old terraces were demolished to develop a new stadium in a phased rebuild completed in August 1998. A section of rail seating was installed in 2016.

A UEFA category four stadium, Celtic Park has been used as a venue for Scotland internationals and Cup Finals when Hampden Park has been unavailable. Before the First World War, Celtic Park hosted composite rules shinty-hurling, track and field and the 1897 Track Cycling World Championships. Open-air Masses and First World War recruitment drives were also held there. Celtic Park hosted the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games and has also been used for concerts by the Who and U2.

==History==
===Original Celtic Park (1888–1892)===
Celtic F.C. was formed in November 1887. The original Celtic Park was built at the north east junction of Springfield Road and London Road in Parkhead by a volunteer workforce within six months of formation. Its opening game was a match between Hibernian and Cowlairs. Celtic played its first match on 28 May 1888 at Celtic Park, against Rangers, which Celtic won 5–2. It hosted a British Home Championship match between Scotland and Ireland on 28 March 1891. Celtic was forced to leave this site in 1892, however, when the landlord increased the annual rent from £50 to £450.

===New Celtic Park (1892–1904)===

The new stadium was built in a disused brickyard at Janefield Street, 200 yards from the old site. The first turf, which had been transported from County Donegal, was laid by Irish patriot Michael Davitt and planted with shamrocks. He recited a verse that said the turf would &quot;take root and flourish&quot;, but it was stolen soon afterwards. A journalist said the move was like &quot;leaving the graveyard to enter paradise&quot;, which led to the ground being nicknamed &quot;Paradise&quot;, although it is also often referred to as &quot;Parkhead&quot;. The new Celtic Park was opened on 20 August 1892 with a match against Renton. A journalist writing in the &quot;Athletic News&quot; described Celtic Park as the best ground in Britain at the time, a title for which it may only have been challenged by Goodison Park, the home of Everton. Celtic Park was immediately successful, attracting record gate receipts and an attendance of 45,107 for the Scotland v England game in the 1894 British Home Championship. Celtic F.C. purchased the site for £100,000 in 1897.

The new stadium initially consisted of terracing with a capacity of approximately 40,000. It was an elongated oval shape, similar to Hampden Park. A running track and concrete cycling track were also constructed around the periphery of the pitch. On the northern side of the pitch there was a pavilion and a seated stand. In 1894, Celtic built the first ever press box at a football stadium in Britain, located high up on the main stand at Celtic Park. Later in the 1890s, club director James Grant financed the construction of an enclosed windowed stand (completed in 1899), built on stilts on the south side of the pitch. The spectators watched through sliding windows from padded seats, but they had to climb four flights of stairs to reach their position and the windows frequently steamed up.

===Fire and rebuilding (1904–1957)===
In May 1904, a fire destroyed the older north grandstand and severely damaged the adjacent pavilion; this prompted Celtic to buy the newer Grant Stand outright. The north enclosure was rebuilt by the following year.

By 1927 the Grant Stand had become unsafe and was demolished, to be replaced in summer 1929 by a new single-tier Main Stand, designed by Duncan and Kerr. This stand, which cost £35,000 and provided 4,800 seats, was smaller and less ornate than the Main Stand at Ibrox. The Celtic Park main stand had a similar feature to Ibrox, however, in the pedimented roof gable over the press box. Prior to its completion, the old pavilion on the opposite side of the field which dated from the original construction of the ground in 1892 and had partly escaped the 1904 fire (it had been &#x27;reduced to cinders&#x27; in that blaze according to hastily filed contemporary reports) burned down entirely in March 1929, destroying some of the club&#x27;s old records and photographs (the trophies were stored elsewhere).
 The club had to play the rest of their matches in the 1928–29 season at nearby Shawfield Stadium (reciprocating an earlier arrangement in 1914 when Clyde suffered similar damage to their ground) and also had to replace the roof of the stand next to the pavilion, which then became known as the &quot;Hayshed&quot;.

Although it was only the third biggest ground in Glasgow, the rebuilt Celtic Park had a greater capacity than any club stadium in England. The record attendance for a Celtic match at Celtic Park was set by an Old Firm derby against Rangers on New Year&#x27;s Day 1938. Some sources give the attendance for this game as 92,000, but contemporary sources suggest that the attendance was approximately 83,500.

===Stadium improvements (1957–1990)===

Significant improvements were carried out between 1957 and 1971, partly due to the great success Celtic achieved under the management of Jock Stein. A roof was built over the back of the western &quot;Celtic End&quot; terrace in 1957, while floodlights were installed in 1959. They were first used on 12 October, in a friendly match against Wolves. The northern &quot;Hayshed&quot; terrace, which became known as the &quot;Jungle&quot;, was concreted in 1966 and a new roof was erected. A roof was built over the eastern &quot;Rangers End&quot; terrace in 1967, using the same design as the Rangers End at Hampden Park. All of this work meant that Celtic had more covered terracing than any other stadium in Britain, except Wembley. There were 4,800 seats, all in the Main Stand, in an overall capacity of 80,000. A further 3,900 seats were installed in the Main Stand paddock area in 1971. A new roof was erected over the Main Stand in 1971, which cost £250,000. It was supported by a &quot;goalpost&quot; framework, with the top girder measuring 97.5 metres long. The design was flawed, however, as the roof provided little shelter to the paddock seats, and retractable columns had to be installed to provide stability in case of high winds or heavy snow. Celtic later sued the designers and won damages.

The regulations in the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 reduced the capacity of Celtic Park to 56,500, but the club then increased the terracing to raise capacity to 67,000. In 1986, £1 million was spent on replacing the western terrace roof with a replica of the eastern terrace, which had been designed nearly twenty years earlier. The original red brick facade to the Main Stand was replaced during the club&#x27;s centenary year in 1988, while lounges and offices were installed. Although the Main Stand had been modernised, terracing was still predominant at Celtic Park. This stood in contrast to most other major stadia in Britain, particularly Ibrox, where seating capacities had been increased. This left Celtic badly placed when the Taylor Report mandated that all major clubs had to have an all-seater stadium.

===Celtic difficulties and fully seated stadia (1990–1994)===
Celtic was heavily in debt and had been significantly outgrown by Rangers commercially in the early 1990s. The Celtic board initially prevaricated in response to the Taylor Report, partly due to divisions in the board. Celtic director Brian Dempsey proposed a development on land he controlled at Robroyston, but he was opposed by fellow directors, Michael Kelly and Chris White, who had Dempsey removed from the board. Despite these divisions, a proposal to build a new 52,000-seat stadium on industrial waste ground at Cambuslang was unveiled in April 1992. The £100 million scheme was meant to include wider commercial developments that would fund the completed stadium, which would have only provided 32,000 seats in a first phase of construction. There was scepticism about the plan, however, as it was unclear how Celtic or their partner in the project, Superstadia, would raise the necessary finance. The proposed site would have had to be decontaminated, and contradictory statements about the ownership structure of the development were issued. Outline planning permission was granted in May 1993.

A deadline of August 1994 had been set to convert all major grounds to be fully seated. Even with planning permission granted, the first phase of the Cambuslang scheme would not be ready until 1995. As a stop-gap measure, Celtic installed 5,033 seats in the Jungle at the end of the 1992–93 season, at a cost of £350,000. The board hoped Celtic would be given a special dispensation from the rules. Installing seats in the Jungle itself caused an emotional reaction. Due to redevelopment work at Hampden, the 1993 Scottish Cup Final between Rangers and Aberdeen was to be played at Celtic Park. This meant that in the last competitive game in front of the Jungle, it would have been occupied by Rangers fans. To give the Celtic supporters last use, a friendly match between veteran Celtic and Manchester United players was arranged.

During the 1993–94 season, the board continued to talk optimistically about their plans. They claimed in February to have £20 million of funding in place from Gefinor, a Swiss financial institution. The claim was denied by Gefinor, who denied that they had even had any contact with the club. Celtic then came under severe pressure from the Bank of Scotland, who demanded a £1 million reduction in the club&#x27;s overdraft, placing the club under threat of bankruptcy. With minutes to spare before a deadline set by the Bank, the board capitulated and sold control to Scots-Canadian businessman Fergus McCann.

===Redevelopment (1994–2011)===
McCann quickly discarded the Cambuslang scheme and instead started plans to bring Celtic Park into compliance with the Taylor Report. The capacity would have been only 34,000 if seats had been installed in the remaining terraces, which nevertheless was greater than Celtic&#x27;s average attendance in the previous six seasons. McCann, who believed the club could fill a much larger stadium, decided instead to effectively build a new stadium. In the summer of 1994, the Jungle, East Terracing and West Terracing were demolished, with only the structure of the Main Stand left intact. The relatively new Jungle seats were used to refresh the seating in the Main Stand. Celtic played their home games at Hampden Park during the 1994–95 season, which cost the club £500,000 in rent. Celtic raised over £26 million to fund the work from two share issues: £12.3 million in a rights issue (£9.4 million invested by McCann) and £14 million in a public offering. 10,000 ordinary fans bought into the public offering, while season ticket sales rose from 7,000 to 26,000.

The detailed plans were finalised in December 1994. The club intended to build a 60,000-seat stadium, to be completed in three phases. The first phase was the new North Stand, which was designed by Percy Johnson-Marshall Associates, engineered by Hutter Jennings Titchmarsh, and built by Miller Construction. Celtic Park reopened with a friendly against Newcastle on 5 August 1995, with the new 26,970-capacity North Stand and the existing 7,850-capacity Main (South) Stand in place. This was augmented by a temporary stand, holding 2,800 seats, on the site of the former West Terracing. Phase two of the redevelopment was completed in August 1996, with the opening of the 13,006-capacity East Stand. Phase 3a was completed in February 1998 with the opening of the South West Corner. This was followed by Phase 3b, the Jock Stein Stand on the former West Terracing site, which was opened in August 1998 with a match against Liverpool. This third phase added another 13,006 seats, bringing the total capacity of the new Celtic Park to . Phases 2 and 3 were built by Barr Construction. The whole redevelopment, which made Celtic Park the biggest club stadium in Britain, cost £40 million. In the 1998–99 season the average attendance was 59,224 and season ticket sales exceeded 53,000, the highest number in Britain at the time.

===Safe standing (2011–present)===
In September 2011, Celtic started a feasibility study into creating a safe standing section in Celtic Park. In June 2015, Celtic received safety approval for a proposal to install rail seating. A section of 2,975 rail seats was installed in the Lisbon Lions Stand during the 2016 close season.

==Structure and facilities==
===Stadium design===
Celtic Park was an oval stadium, but has been converted to a rectangular stadium. It is intended to create an enclosed and intimidating atmosphere for big games. The ground is split into four geographic sections, officially known as the North, Jock Stein (West), Lisbon Lions (East) and Main (South) Stands. The North, East and West stands form a continuous two tier loop. The two end stands each have a capacity of 13,000, while the North Stand holds 27,000. The Main Stand holds just under 8,000, giving a total capacity of . It received 60% of the votes when BBC Radio Five Live conducted a poll in 2002 to find the favourite sports venue in the United Kingdom.

===Stands of Celtic Park===

The North Stand is squeezed into a tight space between the pitch and the Eastern Necropolis cemetery. Part of the upper tier is cantilevered over the graveyard. To save at least £1 million of additional steelwork, fourteen internal pillars were installed to support the roof. Some local residents objected to the North Stand because of the shadow cast over the cemetery, which Celtic believed was necessary to complete the overall project. The proposals were passed because the local officials felt that Celtic had come up with the best solution possible to the problem. Celtic paid £10,000 to compensate residents who had been promised open space &quot;from the centre of the earth to the sky&quot;. The structure also had to take account of the need to maintain access into the North Stand along Janefield Street, which has been closed to the public since the redevelopment. Between the two tiers there are 18 executive boxes and a restaurant. There are 1600 seats in the lower section of the North Stand which have a heated element, operated by a foot switch.

The Main (South) Stand is now the oldest part of the stadium, having first been built in 1929, although a new roof was installed in 1971 and the facade was rebuilt in 1988. Translucent sheets were added to the Main Stand roof in 1998, to allow more sunlight to reach the pitch. Suspended from the roof girder of the Main Stand is a glass-fronted box, which used to house the press box, but was converted into two executive boxes in 1988. Alongside the main horizontal truss are two retractable columns. These can swing down to a fixing point on the rear wall of the former paddock, which provides additional stability in case of high winds or heavy snow.

The East Stand opened in 1996; it was renamed in 2000 after the Lisbon Lions, the Celtic team that won the 1967 European Cup Final. The renaming ceremony was a few days after a Scottish Cup tie had to be postponed after strong winds had damaged guttering in the stand. Away team fans are housed in the Lisbon Lions Stand, in the south east corner of the ground. Some of the away section has its view restricted by one of the supporting pillars of the Main Stand. Celtic offer a discounted price on these seats.

Writing in 1996, Simon Inglis noted that the approaches to the Main Stand were an area of urban deprivation &quot;reminiscent of Belfast during the Troubles&quot;. Redevelopment work was carried out in the land surrounding the stadium ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, in a scheme dubbed the Celtic Triangle, in addition to extensive rebuilding of housing in the nearby Barrowfield, Dalmarnock and Parkhead residential districts and the construction of the Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome directly opposite the stadium. Since 2005, statues of Brother Walfrid, Jimmy Johnstone, Jock Stein and Billy McNeill have been erected outside the Main Stand.
In summer 2015, the exterior of the stadium was adorned with a display of printed banners which will remain permanently. Fifteen green-coloured sections at either end of the stadium – each 21 metres high – form a display which reads &#x27;Paradise&#x27; and depicts images of noted players from throughout the club&#x27;s history (58 players in total, with a different set shown on each stand). Photographic banners of significant events and trophy wins are displayed on further panels at the corners between the main stand and the end stands. The project was controlled by the &quot;Frame&quot; agency with design input from Coatbridge-based artist Jim Scullion.

===Possible developments===
Celtic have considered the possibility of increasing the capacity of Celtic Park by redeveloping the Main Stand. A completed two-tier bowl stadium would give Celtic Park a capacity of nearly 75,000. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell stated in April 2007 that another 8,000 could be added to the capacity, but the work was not considered cost-effective. This position was re-iterated in November 2022, when Celtic chief executive Michael Nicholson estimated that redeveloping the main stand would cost up to £100 million.

In February 2017, Celtic published plans for a hotel and museum development in an area of land between the Main Stand and London Road. Those outline plans were approved in September 2017, with conditions about the size of any retail space. Amended plans were submitted in July 2020.

==Other uses==

Celtic Park has been a home venue for the Scotland national football team over 20 times, the most of any ground apart from the national stadium, Hampden Park. Scotland secured qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup with a 2–0 win against Latvia at Celtic Park having beaten Austria there by the same scoreline earlier in the qualifying process, and in 2006 achieved a 6–0 scoreline against the Faroe Islands at the stadium after Hampden was double-booked with a Robbie Williams concert.

The ground most recently hosted a Scotland game in November 2014 (a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier against Republic of Ireland, won 1–0) when Hampden was unavailable because it had been reconfigured for use as an athletics stadium during the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Celtic Park also hosted both national cup finals during the 2013–14 season for this reason. While Hampden Park was being redeveloped during the 1990s, Celtic Park hosted the 1993 and 1998 Scottish Cup Finals and the 1993, 1996 and 1998 Scottish League Cup Finals, all five featuring Rangers, which were played before, during and after Celtic Park&#x27;s own major redevelopments.

Before the First World War, Celtic Park was a multi-event venue. It hosted the first ever composite rules shinty-hurling match in Scotland, in 1897. Track and field meetings were held every summer, while the only World Cycling Championship to be staged in Scotland was held at Celtic Park in 1897. An experimental floodlit football game was played on Christmas Day 1893. This was unsuccessful due to the ball repeatedly striking the lamps, which were hung over the pitch by wiring. Rugby league football was first played in Scotland at Celtic Park, when it hosted a game between a Northern Rugby Football Union representative side and the touring Australian team in 1909. Open-air Masses and a parade for the Coronation of King George V were staged. Celtic Park, along with many other football stadiums, hosted recruitment drives during the First World War. During one such event at Celtic Park, a demonstration of trench warfare was carried out. The quarter-final of the All-Ireland Hurling Championship between Kilkenny and Glasgow was held at the stadium on 21 June 1913. The first pukka speedway race meeting in Scotland was held at Celtic Park on 28 April 1928. It staged 12 meetings in all before closing in July 1928 (although some of the events may have been staged at the neighbouring Nelson Recreation Ground).

Celtic Park has been used for concerts by the Who (1976), Bryan Adams (1992), Prince (1992) and U2 (1993). Wet Wet Wet played there in September 1997, but their performance had to be postponed by a day to avoid clashing with the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. Paul McCartney planned a Celtic Park date in his 2003 Back in the World tour, but it was cancelled. American evangelical Christian missionary Billy Graham held an outdoor event at the ground in 1991, his first visit to Scotland since 1955. One of the supporting speakers was Aberdeen player Brian Irvine, who had scored the winning penalty kick against Celtic in the 1990 Scottish Cup Final.

Celtic Park was used for the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games opened by Queen Elizabeth II. With Hampden also being used for the Games, Celtic played two European ties at Murrayfield Stadium instead. Owing to further redevelopment work on Celtic Park in 2015, Celtic scheduled three pre-season games for St Mirren Park.

Celtic Park hosted the 2018–19 final of the Pro14, contested by Leinster and Glasgow, which was the first rugby union match played on the ground.

==Transport==

The main railway stations in Glasgow, Central and Queen Street, are approximately 45 minutes walking distance from Celtic Park. Local trains from Glasgow Central on the Argyle Line serve Dalmarnock, which is about 10 minutes walking distance from the ground. Fans travelling to Celtic Park also use Duke Street located half a mile away, with Bellgrove and Bridgeton stations, both approximately one mile away. Between 1897 and 1964, Celtic Park was served by the eponymous Parkhead Stadium railway station. The stadium is served by First Glasgow bus route numbers 2 , 8 , 61 , 64 , 240 and 255 along with McGills service 164 . Celtic Park sits adjacent to the A74 (London Road), near to the M74 and M8 motorways. Visitors to the ground travelling by car can park in the surrounding streets. The new Glasgow East End Regeneration Route, which links the two motorways, runs close by Celtic Park.

<doc id="506183" wikidata="Q273933" url="?curid=506183" title="Marie Krøyer">
<text>Marie Triepcke Krøyer Alfvén (11 June 1867 – 25 May 1940) commonly known as Marie Krøyer, was a Danish painter. She is remembered principally as the wife of Peder Severin Krøyer, one of the most successful members of the artists&#x27; colony known as the Skagen Painters, which flourished at the end of the 19th century in the far north of Jutland. Marie was also a part of the small group of Danish painters in her own right. From an early age, Marie aspired to become an artist, and after training privately in Copenhagen she went to Paris to continue her studies. There she was educated in the principles of Naturalism, and was influenced greatly by the French Impressionists. It was there, in early 1889, that she met Krøyer, who immediately fell madly in love with her. Although he was sixteen years her senior, the couple married that summer and in 1891 settled in Skagen. Clearly inspired by Marie&#x27;s beauty, Krøyer had ample opportunity to paint her portraits both indoors and outdoors, especially on the beach. Married life became more difficult as Krøyer experienced periods of mental illness from 1900, and Marie eventually began an affair with the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén who had also been taken by her beauty. The couple had a child, Marie divorced Krøyer and moved to Sweden with Alfvén. They married in 1912, but marital problems once again resulted in divorce. Marie was reluctant to paint after meeting Krøyer, whom she looked up to as a far more competent artist, and she is remembered more as the subject of some of his best-known paintings than for her own work, although several of her pictures have recently attracted renewed interest. She is now also recognized for her significant contributions to design and architecture.

==Early life and education==
Born in Frederiksberg, Marie was the daughter of Max Triepcke, the technical director at the J. H. Rubens Loomery, and his wife Minna Augusta Kindler, who had emigrated to Denmark from Germany in 1866. She enjoyed a comfortable, middle-class life growing up in the Triepcke home, along with her two brothers Wilhelm and Valdemar. A childhood schoolfriend, Ida Hirschsprung, brought Marie into social contact with Heinrich and Pauline Hirschsprung, Ida&#x27;s aunt and uncle. Heinrich Hirschsprung, a prominent businessman who ran a successful tobacco manufacturing business, was a patron of the arts and had shown an early interest in P. S. Krøyer.

From an early age, Marie showed a great interest in art, aspiring to become a painter. It was very difficult in those days for women to train as artists, but she was talented and enjoyed the support of her parents. She studied privately under Carl Thomsen in the 1880s and was helped along the way by Bertha Wegmann, a leading portrait artist of the day, for whom she modeled at sixteen years of age. As there were no public schools for female artists, Marie had the idea of saving on the expense of private tuition by gathering a group of other young aspiring women, renting a studio, and asking the best art teachers to come and give them occasional tips. Among the artists that sometimes stopped by were Laurits Tuxen and Marie&#x27;s future husband, Peder Severin Krøyer, though Krøyer was dismissive of the &quot;young lady painters&quot; school. In June 1888, Marie became engaged to Robert Hirschsprung, the son of Heinrich and Pauline, but he was prone to fits of deep depression and appears to have broken off the engagement soon afterwards. In 1887, she paid her first brief visit to Skagen, but there are no records of works created by her on that occasion.
In December 1888, Marie went to Paris where, in the spring of 1889, she studied side by side with Anna Ancher at the Pierre Puvis de Chavannes atelier. Anna Ancher, a fellow Dane from Skagen in the north of Jutland, became a lifelong friend. Marie Krøyer also studied in the ateliers of Gustave Courtois and Alfred Philippe Roll, discovering Impressionism and Naturalism, which would strongly influence her own style of painting. Always keen to support better conditions for female artists, she was among the first to exhibit at Den Frie Udstilling (The Free Exhibition) in 1891, an alternative to the academy&#x27;s Charlottenborg.

Marie also befriended the painters Harald Slott-Møller and his wife Agnes Rambusch. Agnes would contribute a lifetime of support and encouragement for Marie&#x27;s artistic pursuits. Other friends with whom she maintained exhaustive correspondence include Georg Brandes, critic and scholar, whom she admired, and the poet Sophus Schandorf and his wife, who treated Marie like a daughter.
==Paintings==
While she was with Krøyer, Marie painted little; she considered her talent inferior and felt frustrated that she could not commit herself fully to art because she had accepted that her role was to be a housewife and mother, saying: &quot;I sometimes think that the whole effort is in vain, we have far too much to overcome ... what significance does it really have if I paint, I shall never, never achieve anything really great ... I want to believe in our cause, even if at times it may be terribly difficult.&quot; By contrast, her friend Anna Ancher enjoyed a more positive relationship with her own husband; she was not concerned by domestic duties, and their artistic styles and motifs were so different that direct comparison was never a problem.

Only a small number of Marie&#x27;s paintings survive, most on small canvases; Lisa Svanholm believes the absence of large works is further evidence of Marie&#x27;s lack of confidence in her talent. Of particular interest are her Impressionistic &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1889), in which she conveys a rather sombre view of herself, emphasized by the thick brushstrokes and the shadow cast over most of her face, and her last known painting, the &quot;Marketplace in a French Town&quot; (&quot;Markedsplads i en fransk by&quot;) of 1898, a small Impressionist piece which shows her talent to the full.

Although Marie Krøyer was recognized for her personal beauty during her lifetime, it was not until the death of her daughter Vibeke in 1986 that her talents as an artist were revealed. The paintings left by Vibeke, now in Skagens Museum, showed her mother was a fine painter who had possessed the unrealized potential to become one of Skagen&#x27;s leading artists This was further evidenced in 2002, in connection with the publication of Tonni Arnold&#x27;s book &quot;Kunsten i Marie Krøyers liv&quot; (Art in Marie Krøyer&#x27;s Life), when an exhibition of some of her hitherto unknown works, 40 paintings and 20 sketches, was held in Copenhagen&#x27;s Kunstforeningen after the author had tracked them down in Sweden. Arnold commented: &quot;It is quite clear she tried to succeed as a painter but circumstances were against her. After Krøyer was hit by mental illness, she gave up... But now we know that for lengthy periods she seriously strove to be a painter, that she travelled on her own, and that something came out of it all.&quot;
Several works by Marie Krøyer are in the collection at Skagens Museum.
==Decorative talents==
Marie Krøyer was inspired by the Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh to design furniture. When she and her husband moved into the town clerk&#x27;s house in Skagen Vesterby in 1895, she designed the furniture and the interiors, as she did when they acquired their Copenhagen home in Bergensgade. Some of her pieces of furniture are now in the National Museum of Denmark. As she subscribed to the journal &quot;The Studio&quot;, she could also follow developments by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, who were members of the Arts and Crafts movement. Her interests extended to fireplaces, woven fabrics, kitchen fittings and wall panels, inspiring the Skagen architect Ulrik Plesner to take account of her plans in his own work.

She was also the architect behind Alfvénsgaard, the house she and Alfvén shared in Tällberg, Sweden. In 1905, after Krøyer had finally given her a divorce, she moved to Dalarna in Sweden where Alfvén had bought a large piece of land beside Lake Siljan. Reacting against industrialization, Swedish intellectuals supporting nature and old building traditions had moved to the area. Marie planned their new home, Alfvénsgaard, combining local Swedish building traditions with interiors in the Art Nouveau style while taking account of Danish craftsmanship. The local craftsmen complied although they were not used to taking orders from a woman.
==Marriage with Krøyer==
 

Shortly after arriving in Paris in December 1888, Marie ran into Krøyer at the Café de la Régence, a favorite with the many Danish artists living in the city at the end of the 1880s. She waved at Krøyer, who was walking past, recognizing him from his occasional visits to the ladies&#x27; classes in Copenhagen and from the sittings when she modeled for the painting &quot;A Duet&quot; (1887). Krøyer, who did not particularly remember her from Copenhagen, immediately fell madly in love with her. Following their engagement on 7 May, they were married on 23 July 1889 at the Triepkes&#x27; home in Augsburg, Germany. (The Triepkes had been forced to move back to Germany in 1888 on account of the father&#x27;s loss of employment.) They spent their honeymoon in Stenbjerg, a fishing village in the northwest of Jutland on the former island of Thy, avoiding the attention of the artists in Skagen. It was there that Krøyer painted the first in a long series of portraits of his wife.

They then traveled extensively in Italy where they visited Amalfi and Ravello. While she was there, Marie contracted typhoid, which discouraged her from doing much painting, though one surviving work of Marie&#x27;s from this trip is a study of a little Italian girl. The couple returned to Denmark in December 1890. After periods spent in Copenhagen and Hornbæk they went to Skagen in May 1891. For the next few years, they spent their summers in Skagen and their winters in Copenhagen. While in Skagen, they first stayed in Brøndums Hotel, but from 1894 they rented a house in Skagens Vesterby, and in 1895 they moved into a house of their own in Byfogedskoven. The summers Krøyer spent with his wife in the 1890s were clearly a source of inspiration for him, especially as Marie had a strong sense of beauty herself, often quoting Keats&#x27; &quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty&quot;.

Her marriage with Krøyer apparently diminished Marie&#x27;s ambitions to make a name for herself as a painter. Indeed, only one work can be said with certainty to have been painted by her in Skagen. Instead, she concentrated on enhancing their summer residence, designing various pieces of furniture, just as she did while they spent their winters at their home in Copenhagen&#x27;s Bergensgade.

Exactly what discouraged Marie from painting is not very clear, but there is little evidence she received any encouragement from Krøyer. From her correspondence, it can be seen she lacked self-confidence and had problems with her health. She also appears to have suffered from post-natal depression after her daughter Vibeke was born in 1895. Several of her friends and associates described her as rather withdrawn, often complaining of headaches and retiring to bed, perhaps as a result of her marital problems.

While Vibeke was still a small child, Krøyer&#x27;s health started to deteriorate with bouts of mental illness, making the marriage increasingly difficult. In 1900, he was admitted to the mental hospital in Middelfart, the first of many lengthy stays. The couple spent less and less time together and often travelled alone. It was during a visit Marie made to Taormina, Sicily, in 1902 that she first met Hugo Alfvén.

==Life with Hugo Alfvén==
Long before he met Marie, Hugo Alfvén had been struck by her beauty in Krøyer&#x27;s paintings. After seeing her portraits, he asserted: &quot;I had never seen a more beautiful woman and the grace and elegance of her figure left me utterly bewitched.&quot; While she was in Taormina with her daughter Vibeke, Marie wanted her friend the singer Anna Norrie to come and join her. As Norrie was staying with Alfvén in Berlin, Marie invited both of them. Alfvén, five years her junior, began to pursue her immediately, and Marie quickly succumbed. Their affair was so passionate that immediately after her trip to Italy, Marie went to Paris and asked Krøyer for a divorce. Krøyer refused, believing Marie had nothing more than a passing infatuation, and ordered her back to Skagen. Krøyer was mistaken; the relationship persisted, and Marie never missed an opportunity to be together with Alfvén in Skagen, Copenhagen or even Sweden. After she became pregnant in 1905, Krøyer finally acquiesced to the demands for a divorce, but he maintained custody of Vibeke. Most of Krøyer&#x27;s friends broke off contact with her when, as she wrote, she &quot;committed the inconceivably foolish act of leaving Krøyer – that good, magnanimous and delightful man&quot;; only Michael and Anna Ancher remained her close friends.
Marie&#x27;s second daughter, Margita, was born in Copenhagen in 1905. She spent two years raising the child there until she joined Alfvén in Sweden in 1907. Krøyer, whose health had worsened since the divorce, died in Skagen in November 1909; Marie, now calling herself Marie Alfvén, returned for the funeral although she had been asked to stay away.

Alfvén had first been hesitant to marry Marie, fearing repercussions on his career as a choirmaster. The wedding finally took place on 30 January 1912 in Uppsala, after which the couple moved into a new house, Alfvéngården, in Tällberg. Built entirely to her own design, Alfvéngården can be considered Marie Krøyer&#x27;s masterpiece, especially as she also created the furniture and interiors, and she designed a number of beautiful little buildings in the local style around the estate.

Once again, Marie had become a partner in an unhappy marriage. Even before the wedding, she had discovered Alfvén had been unfaithful to her with a number of women, but she went ahead with the wedding anyway for Margita&#x27;s sake. Alfvén became increasingly unstable, requesting a divorce in 1928. Marie at first refused, but after ever more serious difficulties in their relationship and numerous courtroom disputes, the couple finally divorced in 1936. Alfvéngården, a major point of contention, was left to Margita while Marie moved to Stockholm where she lived alone for the remainder of her life.
==Death==
Marie Krøyer died in Stockholm of cancer on 25 May 1940 and is buried in Leksand cemetery in central Sweden, not far from Alfvéngaard. Her two daughters, Vibeke and Margita, are buried beside her. Hugo Alfvén&#x27;s grave is also nearby while Krøyer is buried in Skagen.

<doc id="506187" wikidata="Q1416418" url="?curid=506187" title="Mew (band)">
<text>Mew is a Danish alternative rock band made up of Jonas Bjerre (lead vocals), Johan Wohlert (bass) and Silas Utke Graae Jørgensen (drums). Wohlert left the band in 2006 before the birth of his first child, but made a return in 2013 while the band were in the studio, before making his first live appearances since his departure in 2014. Guitarist Bo Madsen left the band in June 2015. This was confirmed in a statement on the band&#x27;s official website on 1 July of the same year.

Whilst their music may be classified as indie and on occasion progressive rock, former guitarist Bo Madsen said &quot;I usually say we are &#x27;indie stadium.&#x27; A mix between &#x27;feelings&#x27; and &#x27;thinking&#x27; is usually good.&quot;

The band announced their separation in September 2024, due to Bjerre&#x27;s departure from the band. Mew&#x27;s two farewell shows are scheduled for spring 2025.

==History==
===Formation and debut album (1995–2000)===
Formed in 1995 in Hellerup, a suburb of Copenhagen, they had a profound impact on the Danish indie scene, emerging alongside the likes of Carpark North, Swan Lee and Saybia, in the early 2000s. They released their debut album &quot;A Triumph for Man&quot; in April 1997 and its follow-up &quot;Half the World is Watching Me&quot; was released in May 2000.

===&quot;Frengers&quot; (2003–2004)===
Their first commercial success came with their third album &quot;Frengers&quot;, released in 2003. At the 2004 Steppeulven awards, Mew won the awards for &quot;Album of the Year&quot; and &quot;Band of the Year&quot;. After a European tour supporting R.E.M. they began to attract wider attention.

===&quot;And the Glass Handed Kites&quot; (2005–2008)===

Their next album &quot;And the Glass Handed Kites&quot; was released in Denmark on 19 September 2005, in the United Kingdom and rest of Europe on 26 September, and in the United States on 25 July 2006. The album received critical acclaim, with Mew described as making &quot;dreamy thunderstorm pop&quot;. At the 2006 Danish Music Awards they won 4 awards.

On 11 April 2006, Wohlert left the band to spend more time with his girlfriend, Pernille Rosendahl, of the band Swan Lee, who was to give birth to their son in May 2006. The two would later go on to form a duo, The Storm.

The band toured with Nick Watts (formerly of UK indie band Headswim) as their keyboardist, and Bastian Juel (who used to act as a studio and live bassist for Swan Lee) joined them as their live bassist. The band finished touring for &quot;And the Glass Handed Kites&quot; in the summer of 2007. They returned to Brooklyn, New York in May 2008 in order to begin recording their next record, and tapped Rich Costey (who produced their breakthrough album, &quot;Frengers&quot;) once again as producer.

===&quot;No More Stories...&quot; (2009–2010)===
The band&#x27;s fifth album &quot;No More Stories Are Told Today, I&#x27;m Sorry They Washed Away // No More Stories, The World Is Grey, I&#x27;m Tired, Let&#x27;s Wash Away&quot; was released on 17 August 2009 in Scandinavia, 24 August in the UK and 25 August in the US. In 2009, the band supported Nine Inch Nails for various tour dates across Europe and the United States.

On 25 October 2010 Mew released their first compilation album entitled, &quot;Eggs Are Funny&quot;, which featured 14 songs from previous albums as well as one new song, &quot;Do You Love It?&quot;. The track list was compiled of what Mew consider to be their &quot;best work&quot;.

===&quot;+ -&quot; (2012–2015)===

During summer 2012, Mew premiered two new songs, with the working titles &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;Klassen&quot;, that were in the running to feature on their sixth studio album, at shows in Scandinavia.

On 23 January 2013 Mew announced via their Facebook page that they were no longer signed to Sony and would release new music independently. On 9 April they confirmed, again via Facebook, that they had started preproduction on their 6th studio album with producer Michael Beinhorn.

On 25 September they released an iOS app entitled Sensory Spaces in conjunction with B&amp;O Play. The app contained, amongst other things, a preview of a new song, &quot;Making Friends&quot;, which featured on the upcoming album. In November 2013 &quot;Making Friends (13)&quot; was made available to stream via Spotify and as a free download via the Sensory Spaces website. The band pointed out that it was not a single, but a thank you to their fans for waiting while they completed the upcoming album and that the album would contain a different version of the song.

During a concert at NorthSide Festival in Aarhus, Denmark on 14 June 2014, Johan Wohlert was formally reintroduced as a member of the band and he played live with the band for the first time since 2006. While the band were onstage, fansite mewx.info posted an article confirming that he had been involved in the writing and recording of the upcoming album.

On 16 June 2014, Mew announced a Nordic tour for winter 2014 and that the album would be released in 2015.

As of the Northside show on 14 June 2014, the new songs that had been played live and were thought to be in the running to feature on the new album were tentatively titled &quot;Making Friends&quot;, &quot;Klassen&quot;, &quot;Russle&quot;, which featured a guitar part by Russell Lissack, &quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Boy&quot;. Aside from &quot;Making Friends&quot;, it was unknown which songs would be featured on the album and what their official titles would be. With the release of the album, the official titles of these songs were confirmed, and &quot;Boy&quot; was not featured on the album. Some of the songs were released with different names; &quot;Klassen&quot; became &quot;Satellites&quot;, &quot;Russle&quot; became &quot;My Complications&quot;, and &quot;Changes&quot; became &quot;Clinging To A Bad Dream&quot;.

On 13 August they announced via Twitter that they had begun mixing the album. On 19 September, they tweeted that they had finished the upcoming album and that release details would follow soon after.

The band announced on 19 January 2015 that the sixth album, &quot;+ -&quot;, will be released on 27 April through Play It Again Sam. They also released the first single off the album called &quot;Satellites&quot; (previously known by the working title &quot;Klassen&quot;).

Mew performed at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas on March 18, 2015.

On 1 July 2015 it was announced that guitarist Bo Madsen had left the band. Mew posted a statement on their official website saying, &quot;After 20 years playing together in Mew, the band and Bo Madsen have decided to part ways for the time being.&quot; Speculations about Madsen&#x27;s departure began circulating when the guitarist was not present at a concert in The Netherlands on 21 June 2015 and in Sweden on 26 June 2015.

===&quot;Visuals&quot; (2017)===
On 24 January 2017, Mew announced their first album following Bo Madsen&#x27;s departure, entitled &quot;Visuals&quot;, via their official website, while a song from the album, &quot;Carry Me to Safety&quot;, was premiered on Danish radio station P6 Beat. On February 16 the album&#x27;s first proper single, entitled &quot;85 Videos&quot;, was made available to stream or download, while a video for the song, directed by Jonas Bjerre, was revealed on YouTube. &quot;Visuals&quot; was released on 28 April 2017, and the band embarked on a world tour to promote the album soon after.

===&quot;With Copenhagen Philharmonic&quot; (2018)===
On 14 December 2018, Mew released the &quot;With Copenhagen Philharmonic&quot; album. It comprised both live recordings and separate studio sessions of songs that had been modified and recorded in collaboration with the Copenhagen Philharmonic Orchestra.

===&quot;Jonas Bjerre’s Departure&quot; (2024-2025)===
On 10 September 2024, after a lull in studio activity and only occasional live performances, the band announced two “farewell” shows to be taking place in Denmark in May 2025. More shows are expected to be added, with the third show being scheduled for early June 2025. Elaborating on the reason for the band&#x27;s disbandment in a post to its official social media pages, Bjerre stated that he &quot;[had] come to the realization that it&#x27;s time for [him] personally to embark on a different journey, and focus on other creative projects.&quot;

==Band name==

Bjerre explained that the name came from their days in high school when, disappointed after baking a &quot;disgusting&quot; cake, the members threw possible band names around, and Mew stuck. &quot;It had a sort of incomplete symmetry to it – it was kinda pointy at the edges and soft in the middle with the small E. There wasn&#x27;t any deeper thought behind it than that, just how it sounded and looked. And it had a mystery to it, in a way,&quot; Bjerre said.
