<text>A Coruña (; ; also informally called just Coruña; historical English: Corunna or The Groyne) is a city and municipality in Galicia, Spain. It is Galicia&#x27;s second largest city, behind Vigo. The city is the provincial capital of the province of A Coruña, having also served as political capital of the Kingdom of Galicia from the 16th to the 19th centuries, and as a regional administrative centre between 1833 and 1982.

A Coruña is located on a promontory in the Golfo Ártabro, a large gulf on the Atlantic Ocean. It is the main industrial and financial centre of northern Galicia, and holds the headquarters of the Universidade da Coruña. A Coruña is the Spanish city featuring the tallest mean-height of buildings, also featuring a population density of of built land area.

==Name==

===Origin===
There is no clear evidence as to what the name derives from. It seems to be from &quot;Crunia&quot;, of unknown origin and meaning, documented for the first time at the time of Ferdinand II of León (reigned 1157–1188). As usual in Galician-Portuguese (as well as in Castilian Spanish), the cluster &quot;ni&quot; naturally evolved into the sound , written &quot;n&quot;, &quot;nn&quot; or &quot;nh&quot; in old Galician orthography, &quot;nn&quot; in Spanish (later abbreviated to &quot;ñ&quot;, like the original Latin cluster &quot;nn&quot;), and &quot;nh&quot; in Portuguese and alternative Galician spelling. &quot;A&quot; is the Galician-Portuguese article equivalent to English &quot;the&quot;; compare Castilian Spanish &quot;la&quot; (&quot;the&quot;).

One proposed etymology derives &quot;Crunia&quot; from &quot;Cluny&quot;, the town in France. During its height () the Cluniac religious movement became very prominent in Europe. There is another town named &quot;Coruña&quot; in Burgos Province.

A more likely possibility is that the name simply means &quot;The Crown&quot;, which in Galician is &quot;A Coroa&quot; and in Spanish is &quot;La Corona&quot;. It seems less likely that it traces back to the Galician &quot;clunia&quot;. The name is reputedly from the Greek Κορώνα (Crown), referring to the crown of Geryon that was buried by Hercules under the lighthouse he built to his honour. The hero Hercules slew the giant tyrant Geryon after three days and three nights of continuous battle. Hercules then—in a Celtic gesture—buried the head of Geryon with his weapons and ordered that a city be built on the site. The lighthouse atop a skull and crossbones representing the buried head of Hercules&#x27; slain enemy appears in the coat-of-arms of the city of A Coruña, Loukeris (2019).

A proxy evolution within the Portuguese language points out to the Latin word &quot;Colonya&quot; as its origin, where the L was transformed into R which occurs widely in Portuguese. A similar happening can be found today in Coronie, a Surinamese town which also made its course outside the Portuguese system.

A folk etymology incorrectly derives &quot;Coruña&quot; from the ancient &quot;columna&quot;, or Tower of Hercules.

=== Use ===
In English, use of the Spanish or Galician forms now predominates. However, the traditional English form &quot;Corunna&quot; is still often used in the UK, particularly in reference to the Battle of Corunna (1809) in the Peninsular War. Archaically, English-speakers knew the city as &quot;The Groyne&quot;, probably from French &quot;La Corogne&quot;. In Spain, the official form of the name is now the Galician one: &quot;A Coruña&quot;, though many Spaniards continue to use &quot;La Coruña&quot;. Despite this, &quot;La Coruña&quot; is in a constant decline, in favor of the official and historical form &quot;A Coruña&quot;.

== Geography ==

A Coruña is located on a peninsula, and its isthmus was at times formed only by a small strip of sand. Erosion and sea currents caused a progressive accumulation of sand, enlarging it to its present dimensions.

=== Climate ===
A Coruña has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) in the Köppen climate classification. Autumn is usually mild with spring-like temperatures, but winter is often unsettled and unpredictable, with strong winds and abundant rainfall coming from Atlantic depressions. The ocean keeps temperatures mild all year round (the variation between winter and summer temperatures is only on average) and therefore frost and snow are extremely rare. In fact, the city has not received significant snowfall since January 1987. A Coruña lies in plant hardiness zone 10b.

Spring is usually warm and fairly calm, while summers are mostly sunny and humid, with occasional rainfall, usually in the form of drizzle; high temperatures are warm but rarely uncomfortably hot because of the sea&#x27;s cooling influence during the day, most often being around between July and September. Even the warmest month on record was relatively subdued, being August 2003, with an average high temperature of . Temperatures above occur many days in the summer, while temperatures above are infrequent.

==History==
===Prehistory===
A Coruña spread from the peninsula, the site of the later Tower of Hercules, onto the mainland. The oldest part, known popularly in Galician as Cidade Vella (Old City), Cidade Alta (High City) or the Cidade (City), is built on an ancient Celtic castro. It was supposedly inhabited by the Brigantes and Artabrians, the Celtic tribes of the area.

===Roman times===
The Romans came to the region in the 2nd century BCE; they made the most of the strategic position and soon the city became quite important in maritime trade. In 62 BCE Julius Caesar came to the city (known at the time as Brigantium) in pursuit of the metal trade, establishing commerce with what are now France, England and Portugal. The town began to grow, mainly during the 1st and 2nd centuries (when the Farum Brigantium Tower of Hercules was built), but declined after the 4th century and particularly with the incursions of the Vikings, which forced the population to flee towards the interior of the Estuary of O Burgo.

===Middle Ages===
After the fall of the Roman Empire, A Coruña still had a commercial port connected to foreign countries, but contacts with the Mediterranean were slowly replaced by a more Atlantic-oriented focus. The process of deurbanisation that followed the fall of the Roman Empire also affected A Coruña. Between the 7th and 8th centuries, the city was no more than a little village of labourers and sailors.

The 11th-century &quot;Chronica iriense&quot; names Faro do Burgo (ancient name of A Coruña) as one of the dioceses that king Miro granted to the episcopate of Iria Flavia in the year 572:

:&quot;Mirus Rex Sedi suae Hiriensi contulit Dioceses, scilicet Morratium, Salinensem, (...) Bregantinos, Farum...&quot;

:&quot;[King Miro granted to his Irienses headquarters the dioceses of Morrazo, Salnés (...). Bergantiños, Faro...]&quot;

The Muslim invasion of the Iberian peninsula left no archaeological evidence in the northwest, so it cannot be said whether or not the Muslim invaders ever reached the city. As Muslim rule in early 8th century Galicia consisted little more than a short-lived overlordship of the remote and rugged region backed by a few garrisons, and the city was no more than a village amidst Roman ruins, the invaders showed the same lack of interest in the ruined city as they did generally for the region.

As the city began to recover during the Middle Ages the main problem for the inhabitants was the Norman raids, as well as the ever-present threat of raids (razzias) from Al-Andalus to the south. During the 9th century there were several Viking attacks on the city, called at that time Faro or Faro Bregancio.

In the year 991, King Vermudo II began the construction of defensive military positions on the coast. At Faro, in the ruins of the Tower of Hercules, a fortress was built, which had a permanent military garrison. To pay for it, he gave power over the city to the bishop of Santiago. The bishop of Santiago became the most important political post in Galicia, and remained so until the 15th century.
In 1208, Alfonso IX re-founded the city of &quot;Crunia&quot;. Some privileges, such as those of disembarking and selling salt without paying taxes, were granted to the city, and it enjoyed a big growth in fishing and mercantile business. The city grew and extended through the isthmus. In 1446 John II of Castile granted to A Coruña the title of &quot;City&quot;. The Catholic Monarchs established the Royal Audience of the Kingdom of Galicia in the city, instead of Santiago. A Coruña also became the headquarters of the Captaincy General. 

Later, in 1522, Charles V conceded to the city of A Coruña the license to establish the House of Spices, being this the port chosen by Jofre Garcia de Loysa to set his expedition to conquer the Moluccans.

In the late Middle Ages, before the expulsion of the Jews in 1492, a thriving Jewish community created a rich artistic heritage in the city. The most lavishly illuminated Hebrew Bible in medieval Spain was created in A Coruña in 1476. Known as the Kennicott Bible, it is currently housed in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The Jewish community is said to have dated to at least the 11th century, with fragments of Jewish tombstones dating to that time period. There is a street in present A Coruña called &quot;Calle de la Sinagoga&quot;, or &quot;synagogue street&quot;, which is believed to be the street where the synagogue once stood.

===Modern period===
During the Modern period, the city was a port and centre for the manufacturing of textiles. In 1520, king Carlos I of Spain, met in the courts of A Coruña and embarked from its harbour to be elected Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as Charles V). He allowed the government of the Kingdom of Galicia to distribute spice in Europe between 1522 and 1529. Commerce with the Indies was allowed between 1529 and 1575. San Antón Castle was built to defend of the city and its harbour.

From the port of Ferrol in the Province of A Coruña, Philip II left to marry Mary I of England in 1554, and much later, in 1588, from the same port the Spanish Armada would set sail to the Low Countries and England, where it was defeated.

In the following year, during the Anglo-Spanish War, the English Armada conducted a besieged A Coruña, but was eventually forced to withdraw. A local woman, María Pita, took her dead husband&#x27;s spear during the siege and killed an enemy captain, rallying support to deny a breach in the wall to the attackers.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the wars of the Spanish monarchy caused a great increase in taxes and the start of conscription. In 1620, Philip III created the School of the Boys of the Sea. In 1682 the Tower of Hercules was restored by Antúnez.

===19th century===
On 16 January 1809, A Coruña was the site of the Battle of Corunna during the Peninsular War, in which British troops fought against the French to cover the embarkation of British troops after their retreat. In this battle Sir John Moore was killed.

Spanish resistance during the war in Galicia was led by Sinforiano López, and A Coruña was the only Galician city that achieved success against the French troops. French troops left Galicia at the end of May 1809.

During the 19th century, the city was the centre of anti-monarchist sentiment. On 19 August 1815, Juan Díaz Porlier, pronounced against Fernando VII in defense of the Spanish Constitution of 1812. He was supported by the bourgeoisie and the educated people. But on 22 August he was betrayed and hanged in the Campo da Leña two months later. A Coruña supported the liberal side in all the 19th-century rebellions. A Coruña also played an important role in the Rexurdimento, and there were founded the Galician Royal Academy in 1906 and the Brotherhoods of the Galician Language in 1916.

Regarding the economy, in 1804 the National Cigarette Factory was founded, and there the workers&#x27; movement of the city had its origins. During the 19th century other businesses (glass, foundries, textiles, gas, matches, etc.) were slowly established, but it was maritime trade and migrant travel that attracted Catalan, Belgian, French and English investments. The Bank of A Coruña was founded in 1857. The new provincial division of 1832 also influenced economic development.

===20th and 21st centuries===
At the beginning of the 20th century, A Coruña had about 45,000 inhabitants. The Great Depression and the Spanish Civil War severely affected the economy through the 1930s to the mid-1950s. The 1960s and early 1970s saw a dramatic economic recovery, which was part of the wider Spanish Miracle. As elsewhere in Galicia, A Coruña attracted a massive influx of Galician-speaking rural dwellers, into their quickly developed neighbourhoods. The period between 1960 and 1980 saw a big transformation in most areas of the city from being agricultural dwellings to urban districts. The international oil shocks of the mid and late 1970s severely disrupted the economy, causing many bankruptcies and high unemployment until the mid-1980s, when slower but steady economic development was resumed.

====Elections of 1931====
In the Spanish general elections, 1931, all the political parties knew that the electoral results had important political consequences. The campaign of Unión Monárquica was very important in A Coruña and was supported by &quot;El Ideal Gallego&quot;. Republicans and socialists constituted a block, made up of ORGA, independent republicans, Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) and the Radical Socialist Republican Party.

In the elections, the republican parties obtained 34 of the 39 council seats. The best results were of the ORGA and of the Partido Radical Socialista, and the Radical Republican Party lost a lot of support.

====Democracy returns====
From 1983 to 2006, the mayor of the city was Francisco Vázquez Vázquez (PSOE), and the city became devoted to services, but he also was criticised because of his being openly against Galician nationalism, favouring the already established Castillian-Spanish social dominance and extending the equally deep-rooted prejudice against Galician language and cultural expression. Another downside&#x27;s of Mr Vazquez legacy would be his town-planning policies, with big-money pharaoh-like projects with little social impact (shopping centres, Millennium obelisk, etc.). However, on a positive note Mr Vazquez&#x27;s 23 year-long mandate saw the European-funded Maritime Promenade and the city&#x27;s Scientific Museums (Casa das Ciencias-Planetario-, Casa dos Peixes-Aquarium and Casa do Home-Domus).

On 20 January 2006 Vázquez was named ambassador to the Vatican City, and was later replaced by Francisco Javier Losada de Azpiazu. In 2007 Municipal Elections the local government was a coalition of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Galicia and the left-wing nationalist Galician Nationalist Bloc party. The city celebrated its first millennium in 2008.

In the 2011 Municipal Elections, the conservative candidate Carlos Negreira (PP) obtained a majority, the first one for the People&#x27;s Party in the city since the arrival of democracy.

The mayor of the 2015–2019 mandate was Xulio Ferreiro, from the Marea Atlántica (&quot;Atlantic Tide&quot;) party, who was elected in 2015 on an anti-corruption mandate. His remit was to improve the town planning of the city rather than to leave it to the mercy of corrupt, unregulated free-market policies which have left a negative legacy in many areas of the municipality. He has widespread support across the region in opposition to a project to sell off the city&#x27;s port (a legacy of the preceding mayor Carlos Negreira) to a private equity firm, which wants to construct a gated community of high-rise apartment blocks for which there is no real market demand in a city with a population of around 250,000 inhabitants. The plan is to put a covenant on the land and to encourage a civic consultation on redevelopment of the site.

The current mayor is Inés Rey of PSdeG-PSOE.

==Population==
===19th and 20th centuries===
After the War of Independence (1808–1814), the fortunes of Ferrol began to deteriorate. The largest port in northern Spain, site of the Reales Astilleros de Esteiro, one of the three Royal Royal Dockyards together with Cartagena and Cádiz, almost became a &quot;dead&quot; town during the reign of Ferdinand VII. By 1833, the City and Naval Station of Ferrol saw its civilian population reduced to 13,000. During the administration of the marquess of Molina, Minister for Naval affairs in the mid-19th century new activities sprang up, but Ferrol never fully returned to its former glory. During those years, most of the Spanish colonies in Latin America succeeded in gaining independence from their former metropolis.
The population of the City of A Coruña in 1900 reached 43,971, while the population of the rest of the province including the City and Naval Station of nearby Ferrol as well as Santiago de Compostela was 653,556. A Coruña&#x27;s miraculous growth happened during the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War at a similar rate to other major Galician cities, but it was after the death of Francisco Franco when the city of A Coruña (and Vigo) left all the other Galician cities behind.

The meteoric increase in the population of the City of A Coruña during the years which followed the Spanish Civil War in the mid-20th century was accompanied by the decline in the villages and hamlets of the province as it industrialized.
===21st century===

The municipality of A Coruña has 250,438 inhabitants and a population density of around 6,700 inhabitants per square kilometer.

In 2010, there were 12,344 foreigners living in the city, representing 5% of the total population. The main nationalities are Brazilians (10%), Colombians (8%) and Peruvians (7%).

By language, according to 2008 data, 7.75% of the population speak Galician as a primary language, 36% speak Spanish and the rest use both interchangeably.

The A Coruña metropolitan area has 431,332 inhabitants.

==Main sights==
The city is the site of the Roman Tower of Hercules, a lighthouse which has been in continuous operation since possibly the 2nd century AD. It has been declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. It is surrounded by a large public park with a golf course and the so-called Moor&#x27;s Graveyard (&quot;Cemiterio do Mouro&quot; in Galician, &quot;Cementerio del Moro&quot; in Spanish) a building where in fact there were never burials, Muslim or not, which now houses the &quot;Casa das Palabras&quot; (Galician for House of Words) museum. The lighthouse features as the main emblem of the city&#x27;s flag and coat of arms.

The city is also well known for its characteristic glazed window balconies, called &quot;galerías&quot;. Originally, this type of structure came about as a naval architecture solution for the challenging weather, particularly designed for rainy days. This fashion started in nearby Ferrol in the 18th century when some of the technicians working for the Royal Dockyards had the idea of using the shape of the back of a warship in a modern building. Soon afterward, most seaports in northern Spain, were adding these glazed window balconies to their city-port houses.

The Old Town (&quot;Ciudad Vieja&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Cidade Vella&quot; in Galician) is the name given to the oldest part of A Coruña. During the ninth and tenth centuries, the inhabitants of what was then called Faro Island (peninsula where the Tower of Hercules stands) were leaving the area due to constant attacks by the Viking fleet and settled in the area of Betanzos. In 1208 King Alfonso IX refounded the city at the present site of the Old Town and put it under his personal control, free from allegiance to the clergy or feudal lords. In the fourteenth century, the scarcely-surviving city walls of the Old Town were built, as well as three harbors: the Parrot and San Miguel. It also preserves the stronghold known as the Old Fortress, now converted into the Garden of San Carlos, in which Sir John Moore is buried. The Old City of A Coruña kept streets and squares that revive the city&#x27;s history and noble mansions and residences such as Rosalia de Castro&#x27;s house, located on Prince Street. Notable buildings are the Royal Galician Academy, the institution dedicated to the study of Galician culture and especially the Galician language, the Romanesque churches of Santiago and Saint Mary, As Bárbaras Monastery (Romanesque and Baroque) and the headquarters of the Operational Logistics Force of the Spanish Army. In July, a Medieval Fair takes place in the streets of the Old City.

The city has several museums, such as the Castle of San Antón Archaeological Museum, Fine Arts Museum and the network of scientific museums (Casa das Ciencias, which also includes a planetarium, DOMUS, made by Arata Isozaki and Aquarium Finisterrae). In 2012, the National Museum of Science and Technology (MUNCYT) opened a branch in the city. A Coruña&#x27;s social scene is most popular on Summer nights. Most bars and clubs are on Rua do Orzán, which runs directly parallel to Paseo Maritimo on the beach side. Another popular destination, primarily for a more youthful crowd, is Os Xardins (&quot;The Gardens&quot;), a park near the beginning of Rúa Real and the Os Cantons Village Shopping Centre.

===Squares, parks and beaches===

* María Pita Square, the most important square in the city. Notable landmarks are the City Hall and the statue of the local heroine Maria Pita. Nearby you can also find Church of Saint George, where first same-sex marriage in Spain took place between Elisa and Marcela in 1901, which is the basis for the movie of the same name.
* Mount of San Pedro Park, a former military area, with views over the city and the ria. Visitors can arrive by road or using an elevator from the promenade. It has a café, play areas, gardens and three restored artillery pieces.
* The promenade (Paseo Marítimo) is long, one of the largest in Europe. It runs around the city&#x27;s headland, passing sights such as its Aquarium, the Estadio Riazor and the Tower of Hercules. There used to be a functioning touristic tramway, opened between 1997 and 2002, which ceased operations after a derailment in 2011.
* In the summertime, the Orzán and Riazor beaches are immensely popular destinations, located directly opposite of the port in the central part of the city. During María Pita festivity, which takes place all through August, Riazor is the venue of Noroeste Pop Rock Festival, a free music festival with groups from Spain and abroad (Amaral, David Bisbal, Joe Cocker or Status Quo have played on it in last editions). Other beaches in the city smaller than Orzan and Riazor are As Lapas down Hercules Tower, O Matadoiro next to Orzan, San Amaro and Oza.

==Economy==

A Coruña is nowadays the richest region of Galicia and is its economic engine. There have been various changes in the city&#x27;s structure over the last few decades—it now shares some administrative functions with the nearby city of Ferrol. Companies have grown, especially in sectors such as finance, communication, planning, sales, manufacturing and technical services, making A Coruña the wealthiest metropolitan area of Galicia. The port itself unloads large amounts of fresh fish, and with the increase in other port activities like crude oil and solid bulk, which make up 75% of Galician port traffic.

In 1975, the clothing company Zara, founded by Amancio Ortega Gaona, opened its first store worldwide in this city and has since become a national and international clothing chain.

Inditex, the main textile manufacturer of the world, has its headquarters in the nearby town of Arteixo. A Coruña concentrates 30% of the GDP of Galicia and in the period between 1999 and 2001 it grew 35%, surpassing Vigo which was traditionally economically stronger. Other important companies of the city are Banco Pastor (owned by Banco Popular Español), Banco Etcheverría (oldest in Spain), Hijos de Rivera Brewery, Abanca, R Cable Operator, the Repsol refinery, Gas Natural combined cycle power plant, General Dynamics factory, Alcoa aluminium plant and La Voz de Galicia, a Spanish-language conservative daily newspaper, the one with the largest circulation in Galicia. A Coruña is also an important retail center. El Corte Inglés, the main department store chain in Spain, has two centers in the city, one of them in the new commercial area Marineda City, opened in April 2011, one of the biggest shopping centers in the EU, which also includes, among others, IKEA and Decathlon stores, cinemas, an ice rink, a bowling court and a kart circuit. Other hypermarket chains present in the city are Carrefour (two centers), Hipercor and Auchan (known in Spain as Alcampo).

Over the last few years, emphasis has been placed upon better access and infrastructure, especially cultural, sporting, leisure and scientific areas. Following a significant oil spill when the &quot;Aegean Sea&quot; wrecked and exploded, considerable resources have been used in the recovery of the shoreline and strengthening the tourist sector. All this has reaffirmed the city&#x27;s existing character as a centre for administration, sales, port activities, culture and tourism. The city also has a regional airport, used by 1.025.688 passengers in 2015.

===Tourism===
Tourism in A Coruña has increased in recent years to the point of receiving 62 cruise ships a year.
The two main beaches of A Coruña (Orzán and Riazor) are located in the heart of the city and are bordered by the promenade above. This location makes them a great attraction for tourists, being also a meeting point for surfers much of the year. Moreover, the city has other beaches like As Lapas, San Amaro, Oza and Matadoiro. These four beaches, along with Riazor and Orzán, were recognized with blue flag certification in 2011.

An important holiday is on the night of San Xoán-Seaone (St John), celebrated on June 23 with a massive fireworks celebration, parade, bonfires and the ancient fires on all city beaches well into dawn.

In 2006 and for the first time ever, the number of tourists has doubled the population of the city, virtually to 500,000 the number of people who chose the city as a tourist destination.

The city has an extensive network of hotels, with an offer of over 3,000 hotel vacancies. There is 1 five-star hotel and 11 four-star hotels, as well as many other hotels and hostels. The city is also focusing on business tourism, offering the Congress and Exhibition Centre PALEXCO, with room for more than 2,500 people; a new trade fair centre, EXPOCORUÑA, venue of concerts, exhibitions and festivals like Sónar.

The city is also located on the English Way, a path of the Camino de Santiago.

==Education and culture==

There are 38 pre-school centres, 47 primary schools, 29 vocational schools and 33 secondary schools.

Higher education is represented by the University of A Coruña, a public university established in 1989, the UNED branch, and CESUGA, a private university centre in alliance with University College Dublin, which offers Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Architecture Irish degrees. Escuela de Negocios NCG offers MBA and other master&#x27;s degrees in business.

There are seven municipal libraries, one library that belongs to the provincial government and one public library, administered by the Xunta. The Archive of the Kingdom of Galicia (&quot;Arquivo do Reino de Galicia&quot; in Galician) is located in the Old Town.

There is an Escola Oficial de Idiomas (Spanish language school) centre, which offers classes in English, French, Galician, Italian, German, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish as a foreign language.

Music studies are well represented by a Music school. A Coruña is also the base for the Orquesta Sinfónica de Galicia.

The city is home to two main theatres, Teatro Colón and Teatro Rosalía, with regular performances, music concerts and other representations. A multipurpose centre, the Coliseum, hosts a variety of concerts and cultural and sporting events. International artists like David Copperfield, Maná, Mark Knopfler, Shakira, Gloria Estefan, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple and Judas Priest among others have performed there. In summer it also serves as a bullring, and in winter as an ice rink.

A Coruña has several museums, such as the Castle of San Antón Archaeological Museum, its Fine Arts Museum, the Military Museum and the network of scientific museums (Casa das Ciencias, which includes a planetarium, DOMUS, made by Arata Isozaki and Aquarium Finisterrae). In 2012, the [National Museum of Science and Technology (MUNCYT) opened a branch in the city.

The city&#x27;s principal festival is the María Pita Festival, which lasts from the end of July to mid-September. The festival includes Noroeste Pop Rock (free concerts at Riazor beach), free concerts in venues all over the city, the medieval fair in the Old Town, the International Folklore Festival, a book fair, Festival Viñetas desde o Atlántico, a comic fair and, for the first time in 2011, a recreation of the famous German Oktoberfest. Another very popular festival is St. John&#x27;s Day, which is celebrated on 23 June with bonfires under the night sky on beaches and neighbourhoods all over the city. More than 150,000 people go out from afternoon to early morning in order to frighten the evil spirits away by jumping over the bonfires. Apart from that, Virxe do Rosario&#x27;s day is also celebrated, but to such an extent as the festivities previously mentioned.

==Transport==

A Coruña is the destination of one of the radial roads originating in Madrid, (N-VI). Currently there is a highway (Autovía A-6) that runs parallel to the old radial road. Another major road running through the city is the toll motorway AP-9, which links Ferrol with the Portuguese border crossing the main cities of Galicia. AG-55 motorway links the city with the Costa da Morte, although currently only going as far as Carballo. The conventional road N-550 (A Coruña-Tui) was the main link to the airport while the new highway AC-14 was under construction.
=== Air transport ===
A Coruña Airport, formerly known as Alvedro Airport, is located in the municipality of Culleredo, approximately from the city centre. It serves mainly Spanish destinations, although there is regular service to London and Lisbon and, in the summer season, to Amsterdam and Paris. In 2010, 1,101,208 passengers used the airport.
=== Rail transport ===
Railway services depart from San Cristovo Station. The city is connected with Madrid and Vigo by high-speed rail since 2021 via the Madrid–Galicia high-speed rail line. Regional lines connect the city with Vigo through Santiago de Compostela and Pontevedra, Lugo and Monforte de Lemos. Intercity ALVIA trains depart to Madrid twice daily. There is a freight train station that serves the port.

=== Intercity buses ===
Regional and intercity buses depart from the Bus station at Caballeros Street, adjacent and connected to the train station by an open-air pedestrian sky walk. A Coruña is well connected with its metropolitan area and other Galician cities and towns. Intercity bus services provided by ALSA, Monbus and FlixBus connect the city with Madrid, Barcelona, Andalusia and the Basque Country among others and with European cities such as Geneva, Paris or Munich.

=== Local public transport ===
Local transportation in A Coruña is provided by :es:Compañía de Tranvías de La Coruña. Its network includes 24 bus lines served by 93 vehicles. Despite its name containing the Spanish word for tramway, it no longer operates any trams. The tramway had been inaugurated in 1903 as a horse drawn tram which was electrified starting in 1911 with the last horse drawn trams withdrawn in 1913. The tram was partially replaced by trolleybuses before completely shutting down in 1962. The tram was subsequently revived in 1995 as a heritage tramway before again ceasing operations in 2011. The trolleybus which had replaced the tram after World War II was itself withdrawn in 1979.

La Torre Sport Complex hosts many football fields, a golf court and another pelota court. There are also five municipal football fields, 11 sports centres and several marinas (Real Club Náutico, Marina Coruña, etc.).

==Politics==
Domingos Rafael Merino Mexuto was the first mayor after the Spanish Constitution of 1978 for the PSG party (he is now in the BNG party), and he currently works at the Galician Ombudsman&#x27;s (Valedor) office.

Francisco Vázquez Vázquez from the PSOE became mayor of the city in 1983; however, on becoming the Spanish ambassador to the Vatican, he was replaced by Javier Losada on 10 February 2006.

The mayor between 2015 and 2019 was Xulio Ferreiro, from the Marea Atlántica (&quot;Atlantic Tide&quot;) party, who was largely elected in 2015 on an anti-corruption mandate. One of his main priorities was to reverse some of the very worst examples of town planning policy which has left a negative legacy in many areas of the city and its immediate suburbs.

The current mayor is Inés Rey of PSdeG-PSOE.

<text>Winchester (), or the City of Winchester, is a local government district with city status in Hampshire, England.

The district is named after its main settlement of Winchester, which is where the council is based and is also the county town of Hampshire. The city boundaries also encompass a large surrounding rural area, including the towns of New Alresford and Whiteley and numerous villages.

Parts of the district lie within the South Downs National Park. The neighbouring districts are Basingstoke and Deane, East Hampshire, Havant, Portsmouth, Fareham, Eastleigh and Test Valley.

==History==
Winchester was an ancient borough, which had additionally held city status from time immemorial. The city traces its history to the Roman Era, developing from the town of Venta Belgarum. It saw historic significance from its reconstruction under Alfred the Great in the 9th century and grew in prominence, serving as capital city until London replaced it as capital. The office of Mayor of Winchester was created sometime between 1190 and 1200, making it the second oldest mayoralty in England, after London. Winchester saw a decline after plague swept the country, but began to recover from the 19th century.

The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which reformed most boroughs across the country. It had its territory enlarged at the same time to bring developing suburbs within the city boundary. The borough was significantly enlarged in 1932, absorbing Weeke and gaining territory from several other surrounding parishes.

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and parts of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Droxford Rural District
*Winchester Municipal Borough
*Winchester Rural District (except parishes of Botley, Bursledon, Fair Oak, Hamble, Hedge End, Hound and West End, which went to Eastleigh)
The new district was named Winchester after its largest settlement. Winchester&#x27;s borough status passed to the enlarged district from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Winchester&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to the twelfth century. The city status formerly held by the municipal borough of Winchester was also transferred to the whole of the new district from its creation, allowing the council to call itself Winchester City Council.

==Governance==

Winchester City Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. Much of the district is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the South Downs National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the South Downs National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 27-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor of Winchester is now largely ceremonial, with political leadership instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1979 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election and a subsequent by-election in July 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2016 the council has comprised 45 councillors representing 16 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with roughly a third of the council elected each time for a four year term of office. Hampshire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no city council elections.

Since 2024, the City of Winchester has straddled three parliamentary constituencies. Winchester constituency covers most of the district area, including 13 of the 16 City Council wards of the district. Hamble Valley constituency lies mostly within the boroughs of Eastleigh and Fareham, but also includes Winchester&#x27;s Whiteley and Shedfield ward. Fareham and Waterlooville constituency lies mostly in the Fareham and Havant districts, but also includes Winchester&#x27;s Denmead and Southwick &amp; Wickham wards. Since the boundaries were introduced in 2024, Winchester constituency has been represented by Danny Chambers, Hamble Valley has been represented by Paul Holmes and Fareham and Waterlooville by Suella Braverman.

===Premises===
The council meets at Winchester Guildhall, on the section of High Street known as The Broadway. The main building was built between 1871 and 1875. The council&#x27;s main offices are in an adjoining modern building called City Offices, to the rear of the Guildhall on Colebrook Street.

== Demographics ==

A Legatum Prosperity Index published by the Legatum Institute in October 2016 showed the City of Winchester as the third most prosperous council area in the United Kingdom, after the Borough of Waverley and Mole Valley.

=== Ethnicity ===
==Parishes==

Much of the borough is covered by civil parishes. The main part of the Winchester urban area, roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 borough, is an unparished area. The council runs a &quot;Winchester Town Forum&quot; for this area to discuss local matters in that area in the absence of a parish council. The parish councils for New Alresford and Whiteley have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

The parishes are:

*Badger Farm
*Beauworth
*Bighton
*Bishop&#x27;s Waltham
*Bishops Sutton
*Boarhunt
*Bramdean and Hinton Ampner
*Cheriton
*Chilcomb
*Colden Common
*Compton and Shawford
*Corhampton &amp; Meonstoke
*Crawley
*Curdridge

<text>Christian Friedrich Freiherr von Stockmar (22 August 1787 – 9 July 1863) was a German physician and statesman, who was a leading player in the affairs of the United Kingdom under Queen Victoria.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Coburg, Germany, of German parentage and Swedish descent, as the son of Johann Ernst Gotthelf Stockmar (1760–1825) and his wife, Johanna Christiane Sommer. He was educated as a physician, and became the personal physician of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in 1816 at the time of Leopold&#x27;s marriage to Princess Charlotte of the United Kingdom, the only child of the Prince Regent, the future King George IV.

==In service of King Leopold==
Charlotte died giving birth to a stillborn son about a year later (had she lived, Leopold would have been Prince Consort of the United Kingdom), and Stockmar stayed in Leopold&#x27;s service as his private secretary, comptroller of the household, and political advisor.

It is said that one of the services he provided was procuring a mistress for Leopold. He was not at all pleased when in 1828 one of his cousins, Caroline Bauer, an actress who bore a striking resemblance to Princess Charlotte, became the mistress of his master. She was brought over to England, together with her mother, but the affair did not last long and she returned to Germany and to the theater. After her death (and that of both King Leopold and Baron von Stockmar), her memoirs were published in which she claimed that she had contracted a morganatic marriage with Leopold and that she had received the title &quot;Countess of Montgomery&quot;. There has never been any evidence of such marriage, which furthermore was strongly denied by the son of the late Dr. von Stockmar.

After Leopold had briefly come under scrutiny for the position of King of the Greeks, he was made King of the Belgians in 1831. From then on, Stockmar took up residence in Coburg, continuing to advise Leopold. In 1837, he was sent by Leopold to serve as advisor to Queen Victoria: one of his first tasks was to brief her on whether Leopold&#x27;s nephew, Prince Albert (later Prince Consort), was a suitable mate. After the marriage of Victoria and Albert, Stockmar became their unofficial counsellor, including in the education of Victoria&#x27;s son and heir, the future King Edward VII, and intervened in several crises.

Stockmar&#x27;s memoirs were published as &quot;Memoirs of Baron Stockmar&quot;.

==Ambassador to the German parliament==
In 1848 he was made ambassador of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the parliament of the German Confederation.

His prominence in the United Kingdom&#x27;s political circles led to resentment at what was seen to be Albert&#x27;s (and, generally, German) intervention in the UK&#x27;s affairs.

Stockmar was raised to the rank of baron by the King of Saxony. He died at Coburg.

==Marriage==
In August 1821 he married his maternal cousin, Fanny Sommer (1800–1868); they had three children:
* Ernst Alfred Christian von Stockmar (1823–1886)
* Marie von Stockmar (1827–1856), married Hermann Theodor Hettner
* Carl August von Stockmar (1836–1909), married Baroness Anna von Haynau (1847–1904), great-granddaughter of William I, Elector of Hesse and his mistress Rosa Dorothea Ritter.

==Screen portrayals==
* Paul Leyssac portrayed Baron Stockmar in &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; (1937)
* Noel Willman portrayed Baron Stockmar in &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; (1975)
* David Suchet portrayed Baron Stockmar in &quot;Victoria &amp; Albert&quot; (2001)
* Jesper Christensen portrayed Baron Stockmar in &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; (2009)

<text>Bridgnorth District was a local government district in Shropshire, England, from 1974 to 2009. Its council was based in the town of Bridgnorth. The district also included the towns of Much Wenlock, Shifnal and Broseley and the villages of Albrighton and Sheriffhales, as well as RAF Cosford.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. The district covered the former Bridgnorth Rural District, and nearly all of the Shifnal Rural District, excluding a small part of Shifnal parish within the area of Telford New Town, which went to Wrekin district. The former municipal boroughs of Much Wenlock and Bridgnorth had been converted into rural boroughs in 1966 and 1967 respectively, making them part of Bridgnorth Rural District whilst retaining some of their civic dignities such as the right to appoint a mayor.

The new district created in 1974 was administered by Bridgnorth District Council until abolition on 31 March 2009. From 1 April 2009 the area was administered by the new Shropshire unitary authority created as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

== Energy policy ==

In May 2006, a report commissioned by British Gas showed that housing in the district of Bridgnorth produced the 12th highest average carbon emissions in the country at 7,176 kg of carbon dioxide per dwelling.

==Political control==
The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties:

===Leadership===
The last leader of the council was Elizabeth Yeomans, an independent.

==Elections==

<text>Clare Hall is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. Founded in 1966 by Clare College, Clare Hall is a college for advanced study, admitting only postgraduate students alongside postdoctoral researchers and fellows. It was established to serve as an Institute of Advanced Studies and has slowly grown and developed into a full constituent college. It is a registered charity.

Clare Hall is one of the smallest colleges with around 250 graduate students, but around 125 fellows, making it the highest ratio of fellows to students at the University of Cambridge. Notwithstanding its small size, the college is also notable for its high number of Nobel Laureate affiliates. Clare Hall maintains many Cambridge traditions including formal halls and the tutorial system.

== History ==
Clare Hall was founded by Clare College (which had previously been known as &quot;Clare Hall&quot; from 1338 to 1856) as an Institute for Advanced Study. The intention was to become a social group of men and women, with accommodation for their families. The proposal was directed at graduate students studying for higher degrees in the university, research fellows working at post-doctoral level, permanent fellows holding faculty or research posts in the university, and visiting fellows on leave from universities around the world.

After Clare College decided to establish this new centre in January 1964, the initial planning was carried through by a small group of fellows of the college chaired by the Master, Sir Eric Ashby. It was soon agreed that the new centre would be called Clare Hall, the ancient name by which the college itself had been known for more than five hundred years until the mid-19th century. Clare Hall maintains close ties with Clare College, sharing some facilities and annual events.

The Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Bologna is so far the only institution abroad explicitly modelled upon Clare Hall.

== Buildings ==
The architect Ralph Erskine was appointed to design the buildings for Clare Hall, which were to include common rooms, offices and dining facilities, a house for the President, and twenty apartments for visiting fellows. A neighbouring house, Elmside in Grange Road, provided rooms for the relatively small number of graduate students.

Sir Eric Ashby, then Master of Clare College and Vice-Chancellor of the University, formally opened Clare Hall in September 1969. Brian Pippard, the first President of Clare Hall, had already moved into the President&#x27;s house with his family; twelve research students were living on the college site in Elmside and a number of visiting fellows with their families were living in the newly built college apartments.

Among the early visiting fellows was Ivar Giaever, who was awarded a Nobel Prize for Physics in 1973. Joseph Brodsky, a visiting fellow and poet in residence at Clare Hall in 1977, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1987. William Nordhaus, a visiting fellow in 1970, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2018.

Other facilities on the college grounds include a sports complex with a multi-gym, swimming pool and tennis court. It also has a dining room which is used for formal halls. The university athletics track is a short run from the main college buildings.

=== Growth ===

In 1978 a second neighbouring house, now called Leslie Barnett House, was obtained for graduate student accommodation. This purchase also allowed the Michael Stoker and Brian Pippard Buildings to be built in the college grounds, providing further student rooms.

The Anthony Low Building in the garden of Elmside was completed in 2000, providing further common rooms and the Garden Bar for the graduates on the main college site.

In the summer of 1996, the college purchased a substantial property, formerly the Cambridge family home of Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild (1910–1990), which is about five minutes&#x27; walk from the college at the western end of Herschel Road. It was renamed Clare Hall West Court and, after conversion and some major building works, now provides public rooms, studies, apartments, study bedrooms, a fitness centre and a swimming pool.

==Student life==

Unlike other colleges in the university, Clare Hall does not have a High Table at meals or a Senior Common Room, and it is a single society for all social functions and in the use of the various college common rooms and other facilities. This encourages interaction between graduate students, distinguished visiting fellows and other senior members, aided also by the wide variety of national backgrounds and research interests of the members.

The interaction between members of Clare Hall is encouraged also by college seminars, lunchtime discussions and formal lecture series. The latter includes the annual series of lectures relating to human values, given by a distinguished international scholar and sponsored by the Tanner Foundation. They also include the annual Ashby lecture, given by a visiting fellow, and the more frequent ASH seminar (arts, social sciences and history) that were initiated by some of the visiting life members.

Other events include art exhibitions, films and small concerts which supplement the wealth of music available in the university.

==People associated with the college==

=== Presidents ===

The President&#x27;s term of office is fixed at seven years. Previous presidents include Brian Pippard (1966–73), Robert Honeycombe, Goldsmiths Professor and Head of the Department of Metallurgy (1973–80); Sir Michael Stoker (1980–87), former director of the Imperial Cancer Research Laboratories; Anthony Low (1987–94), Professor of Commonwealth History and formerly Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University; Dame Gillian Beer (1994–2001), King Edward VII Professor of English Literature; Ekhard Salje (2001–08), Head of the Department of Earth Sciences; Sir Martin Harris (2008–13), former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester; and David Ibbetson, Regius Professor of Civil Law.

Professor C. Alan Short became the ninth President of Clare Hall from 1 August 2020. He is the Professor of Architecture of the University of Cambridge.

=== Fellows ===

The late Lord Ashby was elected as the first honorary fellow of Clare Hall in 1975, on his retirement from the Mastership of Clare College.

Present honorary fellows include two former visiting fellows, Kim Dae-Jung, former President of the Republic of Korea and Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2000, and Lee Bollinger, who later became President of the University of Michigan and Columbia University. They also include the retired presidents of the College, together with Ralph Erskine, architect of the early buildings, and Richard Eden, one of the founding fellows.

Clare Hall has a strong tradition in theoretical physics. Brian Pippard, its first President, was Cavendish Professor of Physics. Notable current fellows include Michael Green, former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics; John D. Barrow, a Templeton Prize laureate; and Stephen Toope, Vice-Chancellor of the University from 2017. Notable past fellows include David J. Thouless, winner of a 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics; Ivar Giaever, winner of a 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics; Stephen Adler, permanent faculty at the Institute for Advanced Study; Michael R. Douglas of Stony Brook University; J. David Jackson of the University of California, Berkeley. Other American academics who were past fellows include Andreas Acrivos (fluid dynamics) of Stanford, Leila Ahmed (divinity) of Harvard, David Epel (marine biology) of Stanford.

<text>Stephen Reed Benson (born January 2, 1954) is an American editorial cartoonist.

==Biography==
Stephen Benson was born on January 2, 1954, in Sacramento, California. As the grandson of former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and former LDS Church president Ezra Taft Benson, he attended Brigham Young University, from which he graduated &quot;cum laude,&quot; and became the cartoonist for the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; in 1980. He moved to the &quot;Tacoma Morning News Tribune&quot; in 1990, but then returned to the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; in 1991, and remained until laid off in January 2019. Benson is now the staff political cartoonist for the &quot;Arizona Mirror&quot; and his work continues to be nationally distributed by Creators Syndicate.

==Awards==
Benson was awarded the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning, was a Pulitzer finalist in 1984, 1989, 1992, and 1994, and has received a variety of other awards. He has served as president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists. His cartoons have been collected in a number of books.

==Controversy==
In the late 1980s he was at first a supporter, then a prominent critic, of Evan Mecham, the first Mormon to be elected governor of Arizona. Benson&#x27;s criticism stirred controversy among Arizona&#x27;s Mormon population, leading some LDS Church members to seek the intervention of Benson&#x27;s grandfather in the matter. In the midst of the scandal, Governor Mecham telephoned Benson and told him to stop drawing critical cartoons about him, or his eternal soul would be in jeopardy. Benson was later relieved of his position on a stake high council.

In 1993 Benson faced further controversy within the LDS Church, when he stated that his grandfather, then nearing his 94th birthday, was suffering from senility that was being concealed by church leadership. Later that year, Benson publicly left the church. He has since become a critic of religious belief, appearing at Freedom From Religion Foundation&#x27;s annual conventions and stating in its paper Freethought Today, &quot;If, as the true believers claim, the word &#x27;gospel&#x27; means good news, then the good news for me is that there is no gospel, other than what I can define for myself, by observation and conscience. As a freethinking human being, I have come not to favor or fear religion, but to face and fight it as an impediment to civilized advancement.&quot;

In 1997, a Benson cartoon used the image of a firefighter carrying a dead child to comment on the death sentence that had just been imposed on Oklahoma City bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh. Benson forcefully defended his work against some readers&#x27; contentions that the cartoon was insensitive.

In 1999, Benson released a political cartoon titled &quot;Texas Bonfire Traditions.&quot; In the cartoon, he compared the 1999 Aggie Bonfire collapse to the Waco siege of 1993 and the murder of James Byrd Jr. in 1998. This prompted negative reactions and criticism from Texas A&amp;M, and forced The Arizona Republic to remove the cartoon.

<doc id="500451" wikidata="Q4363288" url="?curid=500451" title="Highwayman's hitch">
<text>The Highwayman’s hitch is a quick-release draw hitch used for temporarily securing a load that will need to be released easily and cleanly. The hitch can be untied with a tug of the working end, even when under tension. The highwayman&#x27;s hitch can be tied in the middle of a rope, and so the working end does not need to be passed around the anchor when tying or releasing.

==History==
The hitch was called the highwayman&#x27;s cutaway in 1947 by Cyrus L. Day. He related that, according to Hal McKail, the knot was attributable to the notorious 18th-century English highwayman Dick Turpin. Day&#x27;s book, however, suggested it for use as a quick-release mooring hitch for solo sailing.

While the knot is alleged to have actually been used by highwaymen, this claim is rejected by knot expert Geoffrey Budworth, who stated, &quot;there is no evidence to substantiate the reputation of the highwayman&#x27;s hitch as a quick-getaway-knot for robbers on horseback.&quot;

==Tying==
The knot is three bights that each successively lock the previous one: 
#the first one, in the middle of the rope, wraps around the pole, 
#the second one (called the toggle bight) is a bight of the standing part locking the first one so the pole is held tight, and 
#the third one (called the slip-tuck) is a bight of the working part (slack end) locking the second bight.

The locking actions are achieved by reaching through each bight to pull the next one through.

The knot has to be finished by pulling the standing part tight to ensure that it holds.

==Weakness==
Until the knot is tightened and properly dressed, the highwayman&#x27;s hitch has little holding power.
The highwayman&#x27;s hitch is susceptible to capsizing when the pole is substantially larger than the rope diameter. The failure occurs because the second bight sees the force of the standing part, but is held in place by the working part, which has no tension. When capsizing, tension on the standing part pulls the second bight through the first bight. This drags the slip-tuck through, and will release the hitch if the third bight isn&#x27;t long enough.
Alternatives to the highwayman&#x27;s hitch have been devised to mitigate collapse when tied around large objects.

==Alternatives==
One simple improvement is to repeat the second and third bights i.e. one more bight of the standing part and then one more bight of the working part, each successively locking the previous bight; this has the disadvantage of requiring longer rope from both parts.

Another technique is to twist each bight before reaching through it for the next locking bight; the disadvantage here is the difficulty of tightening afterwards.

In his book Outdoor Knots, Clyde Soles presents one of Dan Lehman&#x27;s revisions to the highwayman&#x27;s hitch that is simple and effective, naming it the &quot;slip-free hitch&quot;. One simply rearranges the trio of bights so that the heavily loaded bight in the standing part will surround, rather than go through, the next-made bight; the finishing slipped-tuck bight will thus go through the 2nd-made bight, and so be less severely loaded. As the frame against which this rope toggle is nipped is entirely parts of the knot (and not depending upon proximity to the hitched object), this revision avoids the capsizing vulnerability of the highwayman&#x27;s hitch.

The Notable Knot Index recommends the tumble hitch as a more stable hitch. It&#x27;s a similar hitch, but less prone to capsizing because the main part remains passive and the locking is done by two successive bights of the working part (no end needed) wrapping around both the standing part and the post/pole before locking the previous bight.

<text>Wicklow ( ; , meaning &#x27;church of the toothless one&#x27;; ) is the county town of County Wicklow in Ireland. It is located on the east of Ireland, south of Dublin. According to the 2022 census, it had a population of 12,957 people. The town is to the east of the M11 route between Dublin and Wexford. It also has railway links to Dublin, Wexford, Arklow, and Rosslare Europort. There is also a commercial port for timber and textile imports. The River Vartry is the main river flowing through the town.

==Geography==

Wicklow town forms a rough semicircle around Wicklow harbour. To the immediate north lies &#x27;The Murrough&#x27;, a grassy walking area beside the sea, and the eastern coastal strip. The Murrough is a place of growing commercial use, so much so that a road by-passing the town directly to the commercial part of the area commenced construction in 2008 and was completed in summer of 2010. The eastern coastal strip includes Wicklow bay, a crescent shaped stone beach approximately 10 km in length.

Ballyguile Hill is to the southwest of the town. Much of the housing developments of the 1970s and 1980s occurred in this area, despite the considerable gradient from the town centre. From Wicklow the land rises into rolling hills to the west, going on to meet the Wicklow Mountains in the centre of the county. The dominant feature to the south is the rocky headlands of Bride&#x27;s Head and Wicklow Head, the easternmost mainland point of the Republic of Ireland. On a very clear day, it is possible to see the Snowdonia mountain range in Wales.

===Climate===
Similar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Wicklow experiences a maritime climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool summers, mild winters, and a lack of temperature extremes. The average maximum January temperature is 9.2 °C (48.6 °F), while the average maximum July temperature is 20.4 °C (68.7 °F). On average, the sunniest month is May. The wettest month is October with 118.9 mm (4.6 in) of rain, and the driest month is April with 60.7 mm (2.4 in). With the exceptions of October and November, rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year with rainfall falling within a relatively narrow band of between 60 mm (2.4 in) and 86 mm (3.4 in) for any one month. A considerable spike of moisture occurs in October and November, each of which records almost double the typical rainfall of April.

Wicklow is sheltered from moisture locally by Ballyguile hill and, more distantly by the Wicklow mountains. This causes the town to receive only about 60% of the rainfall the west coast receives. In addition, because Wicklow is protected by the mountains from southwesterly and westerly winds, it enjoys higher average temperatures than much of Ireland. While its location is favourable for protection against the prevailing westerly and southwesterly winds that are common to much of Ireland, Wicklow is particularly exposed to easterly winds. As these winds come from the northern European landmass Wicklow can, along with much of the east coast of Ireland, experience relatively sharp temperature drops in winter for short periods.

==Economy==
Since 1995, the town has undergone significant change and expansion reflecting the simultaneous growth in the Irish economy. Residential developments have taken place to the west of the town along Marlton Road (R751). More recently, housing developments have been concentrated to the northwest of the town towards the neighbouring village of Rathnew. The completion of the Ashford/Rathnew bypass in 2004 meant that Wicklow is now linked to Dublin (42 km north) by dual carriageway and motorway. These factors have led to a steady growth in population of Wicklow and its surrounding townlands while its importance as a commuter town to Dublin increases.

==Toponymy==
Earlier spellings of the town&#x27;s name include &quot;Wykinglo&quot; in the late 12th century, and &quot;Wykinglowe&quot; in the 14th century.

The name is usually explained as coming from the Old Norse words &quot;Víkingr&quot; (&quot;Viking&quot;) and &quot;ló&quot; (&quot;meadow&quot;), that is to say &quot;the Vikings&#x27; meadow&quot;. Norwegian toponymist Magne Oftedal criticizes this, saying that &quot;-ló&quot; was never used outside Scandinavia nor in such a combination. He argues that the first element is &quot;Uikar-&quot; or &quot;Uik-&quot; (&quot;bay&quot;), and that the intermediate &quot;-n-&quot; of the old forms is a mistake by clerks. However, all early recorded forms show this &quot;-n-&quot;. For this reason, Liam Price and A. Sommerfelt derive it from &quot;Víkinga-ló&quot; (&quot;the Vikings&#x27; meadow&quot;).

Nevertheless, the Irish patronymics Ó hUiginn and Mac Uiginn (anglicised O&#x27;Higgins and Maguigan) could bring a key for the meaning &quot;Meadow of a man called Viking&quot;.

The origin of the Irish name &quot;Cill Mhantáin&quot; bears no relation to the name &quot;Wicklow&quot;. It has an interesting folklore of its own. Saint Patrick and some followers are said to have tried to land on Travailahawk beach, which is to the south of the harbour. Hostile locals attacked them, causing one of Patrick&#x27;s party to lose his front teeth. Manntach (&quot;toothless one&quot;), as he became known, was undeterred; he returned to the town and eventually founded a church, hence &quot;Cill Mhantáin&quot; (&quot;church of the toothless one&quot;). Although its anglicised spelling &quot;Kilmantan&quot; was used for a time and featured in some placenames in the town like Kilmantan Hill, it has gradually fallen out of use. The Anglo-Normans who conquered this part of Ireland preferred the non-Irish placename. 

==History==
During excavations to build the Wicklow road bypass in 2010, a Bronze Age cooking pit (known in Irish as a &quot;fulach fiadh&quot;) and hut site was uncovered in the Ballynerrn Lower area of the town. A radio carbon-dating exercise on the site puts the timeline of the discovery at 900 BC.
It has been argued that an identifiable Celtic culture had emerged in Ireland by 600 BC or even earlier. According to the Greek cartographer and historian, Ptolemy, the area around Wicklow was settled by a Celtic tribe called the Cauci/Canci. This tribe is believed to have originated in the region containing today&#x27;s Belgium/German border. The area around Wicklow was referred to as Menapia in Ptolemy&#x27;s map which itself dates back to 130 AD.

Vikings landed in Ireland around 795 AD and began plundering monasteries and settlements for riches and to capture slaves. In the mid-9th century, Vikings established a base which took advantage of the natural harbour at Wicklow. It is from this chapter of Wicklow&#x27;s history that the name &#x27;Wicklow&#x27; originates.
The Norman influence can still be seen today in some of the town&#x27;s place and family names. After the Norman invasion, Wicklow was granted to Maurice FitzGerald who set about building the &#x27;Black Castle&#x27;, a land-facing fortification that lies ruined on the coast immediately south of the harbour. The castle was briefly held by the local O&#x27;Byrne, the O&#x27;Toole and Kavanagh clans in the uprising of 1641 but was quickly abandoned when English troops approached the town. Sir Charles Coote, who led the troops is then recorded as engaging in &quot;savage and indiscriminate&quot; slaughter of the townspeople in an act of revenge. Local oral history contends that one of these acts of &quot;wanton cruelty&quot; was the entrapment and deliberate burning to death of an unknown number of people in a building in the town. Though no written account of this particular detail of Coote&#x27;s attack on Wicklow is available, a small laneway, locally referred to as &quot;Melancholy Lane&quot;, is said to have been where this event took place.

Though the surrounding county of Wicklow is rich in Bronze Age monuments, the oldest surviving settlement in Wicklow proper is the ruined Franciscan friary (founded 1252, dissolved 1551). This is located at the west end of Main Street, within the gardens of the local Catholic parish grounds. Other notable buildings include Wicklow Town Hall, which dates back to around 1690, and Wicklow Gaol, which was built in 1702 and later renovated as a heritage centre and tourist attraction. The East Breakwater, arguably the most important building in the town, was built in the early 1880s by Wicklow Harbour Commissioners. The architect was William George Strype and the builder was John Jackson. The north Groyne was completed by about 1909; John Pansing was the designer and Louis Nott of Bristol the builder. Wicklow Gaol was a place of execution up to the end of the 19th century. Billy Byrne, a leader of the 1798 rebellion, was executed at Gallows Hill near Wicklow in 1798. He is commemorated by a statue in the town square. At Fitzwilliam Square in the centre of Wicklow town is an obelisk commemorating the career of Captain Robert Halpin, commander of the telegraph cable ship Great Eastern, who was born in Wicklow in 1836.

<doc id="500460" wikidata="Q211182" url="?curid=500460" title="Heimaey">
<text>Heimaey (), is an Icelandic island. At , it is the largest island in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, and the largest and most populated island off the Icelandic coast. Heimaey is off the south coast of Iceland. It is the only populated island of the Vestmannaeyjar islands, with a population of 4,414. The Vestmannaeyjar Airport and the Westman Islands Golf Club taken together cover a good portion of the island.

In January 1973, lava flow from nearby Eldfell destroyed half the town and threatened to close its harbour, its main income source. An operation to cool the advancing lava with sea water saved the harbour.

== History ==

=== First settlers ===
In tradition, Herjólfur Bárðarson was said to be the first person to settle in Heimaey. According to the &quot;Landnáma&quot;, he built his farm in Herjólfsdalur (literally: Herjólf&#x27;s valley) about 900. The archaeological excavation in 1971 of ancient ruins in Herjólfsdalur revealed that there had been settlement nearly 100 years earlier.

=== Turkish raid ===
In 1627, three Arab pirate ships from the Ottoman-controlled Barbary Coast raided several towns on the south coast of Iceland and outlying islands. They attacked Grindavík and Heimaey. In Grindavík, townspeople could flee into the lava field of Reykjanes and hide indefinitely. Heimaey was so isolated that it was vulnerable and people suffered. Many heroic stories were told of the people who survived the invasion, most notably Guðríður Símonardóttir. Better known as Tyrkja-Gudda (Turkish-Gudda), she was taken by the pirates from her home at Stakkagerði on Heimaey to the slave market in Algeria. She was eventually ransomed back to Denmark by King Christian IV of Denmark and was re-educated by and later married the poet Hallgrímur Pétursson. The Hallgrímskirkja Lutheran church in Reykjavík is named in his honour.

== Eldfell ==
At 01:00 on 23 January 1973, a volcanic eruption of the mountain Eldfell began on Heimaey. The ground on Heimaey started to quake and fissures formed. The fissures grew to in length, and lava began to erupt. Lava sprayed into the air from the fissures. Volcanic ash was blown to sea. Later, the situation deteriorated. When the fissures closed, the eruption converted to a concentrated lava flow that headed toward the harbour. The winds changed, and half a million cubic metres of ash blew on the town. During the night, the 5,000 inhabitants of the island were evacuated, mostly by fishing boats, as almost the entire fishing fleet was in dock.

The encroaching lava flow threatened to destroy the harbour. The eruption lasted until 3 July. Icelanders sprayed the lava with six million tons of cold seawater, causing some to solidify and much to be diverted, thus saving the harbour. During the eruption, half of the town was crushed and the island expanded in length. The eruption increased the area of Heimaey from to . Only one man died in the eruption. The eruption is described by John McPhee in his book &quot;The Control of Nature&quot;.

== Present day ==
Heimaey is home to around 4,500 people, and eight million puffins
every summer. Many millions of other birds migrate there for breeding and feeding.

The island is connected to the rest of Iceland by a ferry and Vestmannaeyjar Airport.

Most people on the island live off fishing. During an annual festival, people are allowed to catch a few puffins to share at the festival, or to eat at home.

== In popular culture ==

* Some final shots of Chris Marker&#x27;s film &quot;Sans Soleil&quot; are of stark white Heimaey houses slowly buried by the deep black volcanic ash of the eruption. The backdrop reveals splashes of red lava as it flows into a steel-grey sea.
* Heimaey is mentioned in the song &quot;Island&quot; by American progressive-metal band Mastodon. The line is &quot;Lava goddess, Ice and fire, Settling down, Ocean Geysir, Gullfoss, Heimaey 73.&quot; This refers to the eruption of Eldfell.
* Keiko the whale from the &quot;Free Willy&quot; films was in real life flown to Klettsvik Bay on Heimaey as his final home before being freed.
* &quot;Ashes to Dust&quot; by Yrsa Sigurðardóttir (2007, English Translation 2011), the third of her murder mysteries set in Iceland, is largely set on Heimaey and focuses round the Eldfell eruption of 1973, and discoveries resulting from excavation, more than 30 years later, of a house buried in the volcanic ash.
* Heimaey features in Bruce McMillan&#x27;s photo-illustrated children book &quot;Nights of the Pufflings&quot; (1995). In the story a tradition of rescuing young birds, pufflings, by local children is told. The pufflings take their first flight on August nights, and get accidentally stranded in the village streets. The children then set them free at the beach at daytime.
* The 1973 album &quot;Sumut&quot; by Greenlandic rock band Sumé features a song called &quot;&quot; (English: &quot;Ode to Heimaey&quot;).

<text>Hypotension, also known as low blood pressure, is a cardiovascular condition characterized by abnormally reduced blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood and is indicated by two numbers, the systolic blood pressure (the top number) and the diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number), which are the maximum and minimum blood pressures within the cardiac cycle, respectively. A systolic blood pressure of less than 90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or diastolic of less than 60 mmHg is generally considered to be hypotension. Different numbers apply to children. However, in practice, blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable symptoms are present. 

Symptoms may include dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, feeling tired, weakness, headache, blurred vision, nausea, neck or back pain, an irregular heartbeat or feeling that the heart is skipping beats or fluttering, sweating, and fainting. Hypotension is the opposite of hypertension, which is high blood pressure. It is best understood as a physiological state rather than a disease. Severely low blood pressure can deprive the brain and other vital organs of oxygen and nutrients, leading to a life-threatening condition called shock. Shock is classified based on the underlying cause, including hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, distributive shock, and obstructive shock.

Hypotension can be caused by strenuous exercise, excessive heat, low blood volume (hypovolemia), hormonal changes, widening of blood vessels, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, anaphylaxis, heart problems, or endocrine problems. Some medications can also lead to hypotension. There are also syndromes that can cause hypotension in patients including orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, and other rarer conditions.

For many people, excessively low blood pressure can cause dizziness and fainting or indicate serious heart, endocrine or neurological disorders.

For some people who exercise and are in top physical condition, low blood pressure could be normal.
A single session of exercise can induce hypotension and water-based exercise can induce a hypotensive response.

Treatment depends on what causes low blood pressure. Treatment of hypotension may include the use of intravenous fluids or vasopressors. When using vasopressors, trying to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 70 mmHg does not appear to result in better outcomes than trying to achieve an MAP of greater than 65 mmHg in adults.

==Signs and symptoms==
For many people, low blood pressure goes unnoticed. For some people, low blood pressure may be a sign of an underlying health condition, especially when it drops suddenly or occurs with symptoms. Older adults also have a higher risk of symptoms of low blood pressure, such as falls, fainting, or dizziness when standing or after a meal. If the blood pressure is sufficiently low, fainting (syncope) may occur.

Low blood pressure is sometimes associated with certain symptoms, many of which are related to causes rather than effects of hypotension:
* confusion
* dizziness or lightheadedness
* feeling tired or weak
* shortness of breath
* irregular heartbeat, feeling that the heart is skipping beats, or fluttering
* chest pain
* fever
* headache
* stiff neck
* severe back or neck pain
* cough with sputum
* prolonged diarrhea or vomiting
* chills
* loss of appetite
* nausea
* dyspepsia (indigestion)
* dysuria (painful urination)
* acute, life-threatening allergic reaction
* seizures
* loss of consciousness
* temporary blurring or loss of vision
* black tarry stools
==Causes==
Low blood pressure can be caused by low blood volume, hormonal changes, pregnancy, widening of blood vessels, medicine side effects, severe dehydration, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency,
 anaphylaxis, heart problems or endocrine problems.

Reduced blood volume, hypovolemia, is the most common cause of hypotension. This can result from hemorrhage; insufficient fluid intake, as in starvation; or excessive fluid losses from diarrhea or vomiting. Hypovolemia can be induced by excessive use of diuretics. Low blood pressure may also be attributed to heat stroke which can be indicated by absence of perspiration, light headedness and dark colored urine.

Other medications can produce hypotension by different mechanisms. Chronic use of alpha blockers or beta blockers can lead to hypotension. Beta blockers can cause hypotension both by slowing the heart rate and by decreasing the pumping ability of the heart muscle.

Decreased cardiac output despite normal blood volume, due to severe congestive heart failure, large myocardial infarction, heart valve problems, or extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), often produces hypotension and can rapidly progress to cardiogenic shock. Arrhythmias often result in hypotension by this mechanism.

Excessive vasodilation, or insufficient constriction of the blood vessels (mostly arterioles), causes hypotension. This can be due to decreased sympathetic nervous system output or to increased parasympathetic activity occurring as a consequence of injury to the brain or spinal cord. Dysautonomia, an intrinsic abnormality in autonomic system functioning, can also lead to hypotension. Excessive vasodilation can also result from sepsis, acidosis, or medications, such as nitrate preparations, calcium channel blockers, or AT1 receptor antagonists (Angiotensin II acts on AT1 receptors). Many anesthetic agents and techniques, including spinal anesthesia and most inhalational agents, produce significant vasodilation.

Lower blood pressure is a side effect of certain herbal medicines, which can also interact with several medications. An example is the theobromine in &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot;, which lowers blood pressure through its actions as both a vasodilator and a diuretic, and has been used to treat high blood pressure.

===Syndromes===

==== Orthostatic hypotension ====
Orthostatic hypotension, also called &quot;postural hypotension&quot;, is a common form of low blood pressure. It occurs after a change in body position, typically when a person stands up from either a seated or lying position. It is usually transient and represents a delay in the normal compensatory ability of the autonomic nervous system. It is commonly seen in hypovolemia and as a result of various medications. In addition to blood pressure-lowering medications, many psychiatric medications, in particular antidepressants, can have this side effect. Simple blood pressure and heart rate measurements while lying, seated, and standing (with a two-minute delay in between each position change) can confirm the presence of orthostatic hypotension. Taking these measurements is known as orthostatic vitals. Orthostatic hypotension is indicated if there is a drop of 20 mmHg in systolic pressure (and a 10 mmHg drop in diastolic pressure in some facilities) and a 20 beats per minute increase in heart rate.

==== Vasovagal syncope ====
Vasovagal syncope is a form of dysautonomia characterized by an inappropriate drop in blood pressure while in the upright position. Vasovagal syncope occurs as a result of increased activity of the vagus nerve, the mainstay of the parasympathetic nervous system. Patients will feel sudden, unprovoked lightheadedness, sweating, changes in vision, and finally a loss of consciousness. Consciousness will often return rapidly once patient is lying down and the blood pressure returns to normal.

==== Other ====
Another, but rarer form, is postprandial hypotension, a drastic decline in blood pressure that occurs 30 to 75 minutes after eating substantial meals. When a great deal of blood is diverted to the intestines (a kind of &quot;splanchnic blood pooling&quot;) to facilitate digestion and absorption, the body must increase cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain enough blood pressure to perfuse vital organs, such as the brain. Postprandial hypotension is believed to be caused by the autonomic nervous system not compensating appropriately, because of aging or a specific disorder.

Hypotension is a feature of Flammer syndrome, which is characterized by cold hands and feet and predisposes to normal tension glaucoma.

Hypotension can be a symptom of relative energy deficiency in sport, sometimes known as the female athlete triad, although it can also affect men.

==Pathophysiology==
Blood pressure is continuously regulated by the autonomic nervous system, using an elaborate network of receptors, nerves, and hormones to balance the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, which tends to raise blood pressure, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which lowers it. The vast and rapid compensation abilities of the autonomic nervous system allow normal individuals to maintain an acceptable blood pressure over a wide range of activities and in many disease states. Even small alterations in these networks can lead to hypotension.

==Diagnosis==

For most adults, the optimal blood pressure is at or below 120/80 mmHg. If the systolic blood pressure is &lt;90 mmHg or the diastolic blood pressure is &lt;60 mmHg, it would be classified as hypotension. However, occasional blood pressure readings below 90/60 mmHg are not infrequent in the general population, and, in the absence of some pathological cause, hypotension appears to be a relatively benign condition in most people. The diagnosis of hypotension is usually made by measuring blood pressure, either non-invasively with a sphygmomanometer or invasively with an arterial catheter (mostly in an intensive care setting). Another way to diagnose low blood pressure is by using the mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured using an arterial catheter or by continuous, non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring which measures intra-operative blood pressure beat-by-beat throughout surgery. A MAP &lt;65 mmHg is considered hypotension. Intra-operative hypotension &lt;65 mmHg can lead to an increased risk of acute kidney injury, myocardial injury or post-operative stroke. While an incidental finding of hypotension during a routine blood pressure measurement may not be particularly worrying, a substantial drop in blood pressure following standing, exercise or eating can be associated with symptoms and may have implications for future health. A drop in blood pressure after standing, termed postural or orthostatic hypotension, is defined as a decrease in supine-to-standing BP &gt;20 mm Hg systolic or &gt;10 mm Hg diastolic within 3 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with increased risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality. Orthostatic vitals are frequently measured to assist with the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension, and may involve the use of a tilt table test to evaluate vasovagal syncope.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on what causes low blood pressure. Treatment may not be needed for asymptomatic low blood pressure. Depending on symptoms, treatment may include drinking more fluids to prevent dehydration, taking medicines to raise blood pressure, or adjusting medicines that cause low blood pressure. Adding electrolytes to a diet can relieve symptoms of mild hypotension, and a morning dose of caffeine can also be effective. Chronic hypotension rarely exists as more than a symptom. In mild cases, where the patient is still responsive, 
laying the person on their back and lifting the legs increases venous return, thus making more blood available to critical organs in the chest and head. The Trendelenburg position, though used historically, is no longer recommended.

Hypotensive shock treatment always follows the first four following steps. Outcomes, in terms of mortality, are directly linked to the speed that hypotension is corrected. Still-debated methods are in parentheses, as are benchmarks for evaluating progress in correcting hypotension. A study on septic shock provided the delineation of these general principles. However, since it focuses on hypotension due to infection, it is not applicable to all forms of severe hypotension.

# Volume resuscitation (usually with crystalloid or blood products)
# Blood pressure support with a vasopressor (all seem equivalent with respect to risk of death, with norepinephrine possibly better than dopamine). Trying to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 70 mmHg does not appear to result in better outcomes than trying to achieve a MAP of greater than 65 mmHg in adults.
# Ensure adequate tissue perfusion (maintain SvO2 &gt;70 with use of blood or dobutamine)
# Address the underlying problem (i.e., antibiotic for infection, stent or CABG (coronary artery bypass graft surgery) for infarction, steroids for adrenal insufficiency, etc...)

The best way to determine if a person will benefit from fluids is by doing a passive leg raise followed by measuring the output from the heart.

=== Medication ===

Chronic hypotension sometimes requires the use of medications. Some medications that are commonly used include Fludrocortisone, Erythropoietin, and Sympathomimetics such as Midodrine and Noradrenaline and precursor (L-DOPS).
* Fludrocortisone is the first-line therapy (in the absence of heart failure) for patients with chronic hypotension or resistant orthostatic hypotension. It works by increasing the intravascular volume.
* Midodrine is a therapy used for severe orthostatic hypotension, and works by increasing peripheral vascular resistance.
* Noradrenaline and its precursor L-DOPS are used for primary autonomic dysfunction by increasing vascular tone.
* Erythropoietin is given to patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and it works through increasing vascular volume and viscosity.

== Pediatrics ==
The definition of hypotension changes in the pediatric population depending on the child&#x27;s age as seen in the table below.

The clinical history provided by the caretaker is the most important part in determining the cause of hypotension in pediatric patients. Symptoms for children with hypotension include increased sleepiness, not using the restroom as much (or at all), having difficulty breathing or breathing rapidly, or syncope. The treatment for hypotension in pediatric patients is similar to the treatment in adults by following the four first steps listed above (see Treatment). Children are more likely to undergo intubation during the treatment of hypotension because their oxygen levels drop more rapidly than adults. The closing of fetal shunts following birth can create instability in the &quot;transitional circulation&quot; of the fetus, and often creates a state of hypotension following birth; while many infants can overcome this hypotension through the closing of shunts, a mean blood pressure (MBP) of lower than 30 mmHg is correlated with severe cerebral injury and can be experienced by premature infants who have poor shunt closure.

==Etymology==
&quot;Hypotension&quot;, from Ancient Greek &quot;hypo-&quot;, meaning &quot;under&quot; or &quot;less&quot; + English &quot;tension&quot;, meaning &quot;&#x27;strain&quot; or &quot;tightness&quot;. This refers to the under-constriction of the blood vessels and arteries which leads to low blood pressure.

<text>Inez Foxx (September 9, 1937 – August 25, 2022) and her elder brother Charlie Foxx (October 23, 1933 – September 18, 1998) were an American rhythm and blues and soul duo from Greensboro, North Carolina. Inez sang lead vocal, while Charlie sang backing vocals and played guitar. Casey Kasem, and doubtless many others, mistakenly thought that the two were husband and wife.

==Biography==
Both children were born in Greensboro to John and Peggy Fox. According to published information in the North Carolina Birth Index, and the U.S. census, Charlie James Fox was born in 1933 and Inez Rebecca Fox in 1937, though subsequent publicity indicated later birth years for both siblings. They changed their professional names to Foxx with a double &#x27;x&#x27;.

Charlie Foxx began singing with a gospel choir as a child in the early 1950s, and was later joined by his sister Inez. In 1960, Inez traveled to New York City and recorded for Brunswick Records using her then-married name Inez Johnston, but with little success. In early 1963, the pair introduced themselves to Henry &#x27;Juggy&#x27; Murray, the owner of Sue Records, and sang him their arrangement of the traditional lullaby &quot;Hush, Little Baby&quot;. The song, re-titled &quot;Mockingbird,&quot; was released on Sue&#x27;s subsidiary label Symbol Records in June 1963. The single reached the top 10 on both the US rhythm and blues and pop charts. It was their most successful record, selling over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. It was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin, James Taylor and Carly Simon, Dusty Springfield, Etta James with Taj Mahal and Toby Keith.

The record company, keen to promote Inez Foxx as a solo singer, issued later recordings under her name alone, despite the presence of two voices on the records. Perhaps because &quot;Mockingbird&quot; was seen as a novelty record, the pair had difficulty following it up, although &quot;Ask Me&quot; and &quot;Hurt by Love&quot; made the lower reaches of the US charts, and &quot;Hurt by Love&quot; also reached the UK singles chart. In 1966, the pair joined Musicor Records and recorded for its subsidiary label, Dynamo. They returned to the pop charts in 1967 with &quot;(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days&quot;, and became known for their exciting live performances. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern soul movement, in which scene they had the very popular &quot;Tightrope&quot; single.

Inez Foxx married songwriter and producer Luther Dixon in the late 1960s. Together they wrote, and he produced, the Platters&#x27; mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single &quot;I Love You 1000 Times&quot;. Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie&#x27;s 1967 Dynamo album &quot;Come By Here&quot;, but the couple later divorced.

Inez also had some success recording on her own, beginning in 1969, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a songwriter and record producer when they finally disbanded their act. Inez continued to record as a solo singer for Volt Records in the 1970s.

Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998, at the age of 64, and was buried in Mobile, Alabama. Inez Foxx died in Los Angeles on August 25, 2022, at the age of 84 (though some sources incorrectly stated her age as 79).

<text>Çorum () is a northern Anatolian city in Turkey. Çorum is located inland in the central Black Sea Region of Turkey and is approximately from Ankara and from Istanbul. It is the seat of Çorum Province and of Çorum District. Its population is 269,595 (2022). The city has an elevation of above sea level.

Çorum is primarily known for its Phrygian and Hittite archaeological sites, its thermal springs, and its native roasted chickpea snacks known nationally as leblebi.

==History==
There is ample archaeological evidence for human presence in the area since the Paleolithic Age.
The area prospered during the Bronze Age, with the emergence of the Hittite Empire between 1650 and 1200 BCE. Hattusa, the Hittite capital, was located in the region owing to its inherent geographic protection and the well-established local economy as supported by the regional Karum system.

There is a hypothesis that the Byzantine town of Euchaneia was at or near the site of the modern city, but others place Euchaneia further east, at Euchaita. In Ancient Greek sources, Çorum was known as Niconia (Nikonya), and in the Byzantine period known as Evkaite.


The settlement of Çorum proper can be traced only to the 16th century. The name is of unknown origin and is first attested in Ottoman records about a Seljuk fortress, &quot;Çorum Kalesi,&quot; described by Evliya Çelebi. In the mid-16th century, the fortress was divided into four mahalle, or quarters. From 1867 until 1922, Çorum was part of the Angora vilayet.

==Çorum today==

The town today is generally tidy and pleasant, with a locally popular countryside. As with most Central Anatolian and inland Black Sea towns, the population is largely conservative, leading to a generally more restricted nightlife that favors dry establishments, although there are some bars, pubs, and cafés that offer a mix of contemporary and traditional Turkish folk music. Within the city, there is a good range of shops, cafés, and restaurants, with a cuisine that includes a variety of pastries including the nationally known Çorum Mantısı - a popular dish similar to ravioli that is slowly baked in a brick oven or steamed in a beef broth. As well as the archeological and other historic sites, the countryside surrounding Çorum offers many places for picnics, particularly near the Çomar reservoir or in the mountains around the province.

The old Ottoman houses, the 19th-century clock tower, and the Çorum Museum, which displays a range of artefacts from excavations in the region, are popular tourist attractions. An &quot;International Hittite Congress&quot; of archaeologists is held in Çorum every three years.

==Economy==
Although the economic output of the city has historically been relatively small, with a focus on traditional crafts such as coppersmithing, tanning, hand weaving, agriculture, and animal husbandry, over the past two decades, the city has shown a significant growth in industrial production and light engineering, making it one of the most industrially advanced cities relative to its population size.

Originally home to about 20 tile and brick manufacturing facilities and 10 flour and feed mills, the city today produces a wide variety of products ranging from cement to automobile parts, refined sugar to dairy products, textiles to computer parts, and, more recently, poultry through chicken farming.

==Population==

==Geography==
Çorum is on the northern edge of the Central Anatolian Plateau. The city is on a plain surrounded by mountains. The Merzifon branch of the North Anatolian Fault passes about north of Çorum, with the main fault line passing about north.

===Climate===
Çorum has a warm summer continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot; or Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Dcb&quot;) with dry summers and cold, snowy winters. It also has mild to cool wet springs and autumns with light rain.

Highest recorded temperature: on 30 July 2000.Lowest recorded temperature: on 23 February 1985.

<text>The American Institute of Architects (AIA) is a professional organization for architects in the United States. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C. AIA offers education, government advocacy, community redevelopment, and public outreach programs, and collaborates with other stakeholders in the design and construction industries.

==History==
The American Institute of Architects (AIA) was founded in 1857 in New York City by a group of thirteen architects. The founding members include Charles Babcock, Henry W. Cleaveland, Henry Dudley, Leopold Eidlitz, Edward Gardiner, Richard Morris Hunt, Detlef Lienau, Fred A. Petersen, Jacob Wrey Mould, John Welch, Richard M. Upjohn, and Joseph C. Wells, with Richard Upjohn serving as the first president. They held their inaugural meeting on February 23, 1857, and invited 16 additional architects to join, including Alexander Jackson Davis, Thomas U. Walter, Frederick Clarke Withers, and Calvert Vaux. There were no architectural schools or licensing laws in the United States at the time, allowing anyone to claim to be an architect.

By March 10, 1857, they had drafted a constitution and bylaws under the name New York Society of Architects. The name was later changed to the American Institute of Architects at the suggestion of Thomas U. Walter. On April 15, 1857, the members signed the new constitution, having previously filed a certificate of incorporation two days earlier. The following year, the constitution was amended to include the mission of promoting the artistic, scientific, and practical aspects of architecture, facilitating professional interaction and camaraderie, raising the profession&#x27;s standing, and uniting architects for the advancement of the field.

In the 1860s, architects from other cities began joining the AIA. By the 1880s, chapters had been established in Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Rhode Island, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C. As of 2008, the AIA boasted over 300 chapters.

In the mid-1960s, a design competition was held to select an architect for a new AIA headquarters located at 1735 New York Avenue, NW, in Washington, D.C. Mitchell Giurgola Architects won the competition but failed to gain approval from the United States Commission of Fine Arts for the design concept. Subsequently, the firm resigned from the commission, and The Architects Collaborative (TAC) was chosen to redesign the building. Led by TAC principals Norman Fletcher and Howard Elkus, the design was ultimately approved in 1970 and completed in 1973.

In 2007, on the organization&#x27;s 150th anniversary, the building was officially renamed the &quot;American Center for Architecture.&quot; It also serves as the home of the American Institute of Architecture Students, the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, and the National Architectural Accrediting Board.

==Organization==
===Membership===
The American Institute of Architects (AIA) has a membership of over 98,000 licensed architects and associated professionals. AIA members adhere to a code of ethics and professional conduct designed to demonstrate commitment to upholding the highest standards in professional practice and dedication.

AIA offers membership at five different levels:
#Architect members (AIA): These individuals are licensed to practice architecture by a recognized licensing authority in the United States.
#Associate members (Assoc. AIA): While they do not hold a license to practice architecture, associate members work under the supervision of an architect in a professional or technical capacity. They may have earned professional degrees in architecture, work as faculty members in architecture programs, or be interns earning credit toward licensure.
#International associate members: This category is for individuals who hold an architecture license or its equivalent from a licensing authority outside the United States.
#Emeritus members: These members have maintained AIA membership for 15 consecutive years and are either at least 70 years old or incapacitated and unable to work in the architecture profession.
#Allied members: Allied members are professionals whose work is related to the building and design communities. This includes engineers, landscape architects, planners, and senior executive staff from building and design-related companies, such as publishers, product manufacturers, and research firms. Allied membership represents a partnership between the AIA and the American Architectural Foundation.

The AIA&#x27;s most esteemed recognition is the Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (FAIA) designation. This honor is awarded to members who have made nationally significant contributions to the profession. Approximately 2% of all members, or slightly more than 2,600 individuals, have been elevated to the AIA College of Fellows. Prominent foreign architects may also be elected as Honorary Fellows of the AIA, gaining recognition within the college.

===Structure===
The AIA operates under the governance of a board of directors and maintains a staff of nearly 200 employees. While the AIA serves as a national organization, its reach is extended through its 217 local and state chapters. Chapters span the United States and its territories. AIA components also operate in several international locations, including the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Canada. These chapters offer programming and direct services to support AIA members at various stages of their professional careers.

In June 2013, the American Institute of Architects unveiled the &quot;Designing Recovery&quot; initiative during CGI America, an annual event of the Clinton Global Initiative. This initiative involved a design contest conducted in partnership with charitable organizations such as Make It Right, SBP, and Architecture for Humanity. The contest focused on single-family housing designs aimed at enhancing the quality, diversity, and resilience of housing in each community. The portfolio of designs, including those from non-winning entries, was made available to communities recovering from natural disasters. Dow Building Solutions sponsored the contest, providing a total prize money of $30,000. The prize was equally distributed among three winning designs from New Orleans, Louisiana; Joplin, Missouri; and New York City.

===Professionalism===
AIA members actively contribute to their profession and communities by participating in various professional interest areas, ranging from design to regional and urban development. They also engage with professional academies that foster the generation of new ideas and responses. Local components provide support to younger professionals through programs such as the Intern Development Program, Architect Registration Exam preparation courses, and employment referral services.

The AIA organizes an annual conference held in late spring or early summer, which attracts the largest gathering of architects worldwide.

===Public education===
The AIA attempts to meet the needs and interests of the nation&#x27;s architects and the public by raising public awareness of the value of architecture and the importance of good design. To mark the AIA&#x27;s 150th anniversary and to showcase how members have helped shape the built environment, the AIA and Harris Interactive released findings from a public poll that asked Americans to name their favorite 150 works of architecture, America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture.

===Honors and awards===
The AIA recognizes individuals and organizations for outstanding achievements in support of the architecture profession and the AIA.

<text>Unterallgäu () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Neu-Ulm, Günzburg, Augsburg, Ostallgäu, Oberallgäu, and the districts Ravensburg und Biberach in Baden-Württemberg. The district-free city Memmingen in the west of the district is nearly surrounded by the district. The capital of the district is Mindelheim.

==Geography==
The district is located in the &quot;Allgäu&quot;, the northern foothills of the Alps. The river Iller forms part of the western boundary of the district.

==History==
The district was created July 1, 1972 by merging the previous districts Mindelheim and Memmingen. Mindelheim is the administrative seat of the new district.

==Partnerships==
The district started a partnership with the Polish Gostyn County in 2001.

==Coat of arms==
The rose in the left of the coat of arms is the symbol of the abbey of Ottobeuren, which ruled the southern part of the district. The fleur-de-lis in the right stands for the Fugger family, who owned several estates in the district. To the bottom are the Bavarian lozenges, to symbolize that the area became part of Bavaria in 1814.

<text>Alcántara () is a municipality in the province of Cáceres, Extremadura, Spain, on the Tagus, near Portugal. The toponym is from the Arabic word &quot;al-Qanṭarah&quot; (القنطرة) meaning &quot;the bridge&quot;.

==History==
Archaeological findings have attested human presence in the area from the Bronze Age; the first historical inhabitants were the Lusitanians, followed by the Celts, who came from an area between central Iberia and the Pyrenees. To this period, and to the following Roman domination, belong the remains of several &quot;castra&quot; (military camps), villas and the bridge which gives its name to the city. Roman rule lasted from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century, when they were replaced by the Visigoths.

In the 8th century, the Moors conquered the Iberian Peninsula and called it Al-Andalus, ending four centuries of Visigothic presence in what is now Spain, France, Portugal and Gibraltar. In the 12th century, the Muslim geographer al-Idrisi described the bridge as one of the wonders of the world. Alcántara was a frontier city in the 12th and 13th centuries, devoted to military activities and animal husbandry. After the collapse of the Caliphate of Córdoba, it belonged to several Islamic taifas (petty kingdoms).

Ferdinand II of León liberated Alcántara in 1167 during his wars against Portugal, but the town was later recaptured by the Almohads. The Christians conquered it permanently in 1213 with Alfonso IX of León. In 1217 it was given to the military order of Calatrava. They, however, considered it too difficult to defend, and thus the following year they were replaced by the Order of San Julian de Pereiro, a military order created in 1156 which had its headquarters on the Rio Cora and which later took its name from Alcántara, where it was established. The city maintained its strategic importance until 1655. In 1807, during the Peninsular War, it was occupied by French troops.

Alcántara lost all its importance in the 19th century when the order&#x27;s properties were secularized. Its depopulation was halted only in the 1960s, when the electric company Hidroelectrica Espaňola built several plants here. However, its economy was not boosted, and the town is still part of one of the less developed areas of Spain.

The Order of Alcántara, a religious and military order, was established in the town in 1176 for defence against the Moors, and was suppressed in 1835.

In 1499, Peter of Alcántara, teacher of Theresa of Ávila, saint and Franciscan reformer, was born here.

==Main sights==
*Alcántara Bridge, of six symmetrical arches, 194 m long and 71 m high, built in honour of Trajan in 103-106. An inscription gives the name of the architect of the viaduct, C. Iulius Lacer.
*Convent of San Benito de Alcántara (16th century)
*Church of Holy Mother of Almocobar (13th century)
*Remains of the Moorish walls, modified and restored in the Middle Ages
*Convent of St. Francis (15th-17th centuries)
*Convent of the Nuns of &quot;Los Remedios&quot;, of which only the Baroque Chapel remains

<text>Commander Abraham Whipple (September 26, 1733 – May 27, 1819) was an American naval officer best known for his service in the Continental Navy during the Revolutionary War and being one of the founders of Marietta, Ohio. Born near Providence, Colony of Rhode Island, Whipple chose to be a seafarer early in his life and embarked on a career in the lucrative trade with the West Indies, working for Moses and John Brown. In the French and Indian War period, he became a privateersman and commanded privateer &quot;Game Cock&quot; from 1759 to 1760. In one six-month cruise, he captured 23 French ships.

In 1772, Whipple burnt the first British naval casualty of the American Revolution, the revenue cutter &quot;Gaspee&quot;, in the &quot;Gaspée&quot; Affair. The first to unfurl the Star Spangled Banner in London, Whipple was also the first to sail an ocean-going ship 2000 miles downriver from Ohio to the Caribbean, which opened trade with the Northwest Territory. Abraham Whipple was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati of the State of Rhode Island.

==Early life==

Whipple was born on September 26, 1733, to Noah Whipple Jr. Abraham Whipple and Sarah Hopkins were married on August 2, 1761. They had three children: John, Catherine, and Mary. Catherine later married Colonel Ebenezer Sproat of the Continental Army. Whipple sold enslaved people as part of his mercantile career; in November 1763, Whipple sold an enslaved woman named Deuse to Nicholas Brown &amp; Co.

==Revolutionary activities==

===Rhode Island===
As American colonists began to express their opposition to the policies of the Crown, acts of defiance became increasingly prevalent. An early incident occurred on June 9, 1772, when Whipple led 50 Rhode Islanders in the capture and burning of the British revenue cutter &quot;Gaspee&quot;. The ship had run aground off Pawtuxet while chasing the packet &quot;Hannah&quot;. The burning initiated an exchange of notes between Whipple and Captain James Wallace of HMS &quot;Rose&quot;. Wallace wrote, &quot;You Abraham Whipple on June 10, 1772, burned his majesty&#x27;s vessel the &quot;Gaspee&quot; and I will hang you at the yard arm!&quot; Whipple responded, &quot;Sir, always catch a man before you hang him.&quot;

Three years later, the Rhode Island General Assembly appointed Whipple commodore of two ships fitted for the defense of the colony&#x27;s trade. On June 15, 1775, (the day the sea captain received his commission), Whipple led his men to capture the tender to frigate HMS &quot;Rose&quot;. After cruising in the vicinity of Narragansett Bay, he headed south to Bermuda to procure gunpowder for use by the colony. On the return voyage, Whipple transported naval recruits to Philadelphia. Upon her arrival there, his ship, &quot;Katy&quot;, was taken over by agents of the Continental Congress and was fitted out as sloop-of-war &quot;Providence&quot;.

===Naval command===

Whipple was commissioned a captain in the Continental Navy on December 22 and was given command of 24-gun ship &quot;Columbus&quot;. From February 17 to April 8, 1776, he commanded the ship during the first Continental Navy-Marine Corps amphibious expedition—the cruise to New Providence, in the Bahamas, to seize essential military supplies from the British garrison at Nassau.

After returning north to New England, Whipple captured five British prizes before March 27, 1778, when his ship ran aground off Point Judith, Rhode Island. After stripping the ship, the captain and his crew abandoned her and escaped capture ashore.

Assigned next to command 28-gun frigate &quot;Providence&quot;, Whipple ran the British blockade on the night of April 30, 1778, damaging HMS &quot;Lark&quot; and outrunning another British ship during the escape. Tacking for France, the &quot;Providence&quot; crossed the Atlantic Ocean unmolested, bearing important dispatches relating to agreements between France and the American colonies, and reached Paimboeuf. After acquiring guns and supplies for the Continental Army, the &quot;Providence&quot; and the &quot;Boston&quot; sailed home to the colonies, taking three prizes en route.

Upon his return, Whipple received command of a small squadron—&quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot;, and &quot;Queen of France&quot;. On one occasion in mid-July 1779, this group of ships encountered a large British convoy in dense fog off the Newfoundland Banks. Whipple concealed his guns and ran up the British flag. Thus disguised, Whipple cut 11 prizes out of the convoy, eight of which contained spoils of war valued together at over one million dollars (roughly 25.7 million in 2024 dollars), making the venture easily one of the richest captures of the entire war.

Whipple then cruised off Bermuda before arriving at Charleston, South Carolina. On December 23, 1779. British forces threatened Charleston, which was at the time a key Continental port. The threat led Whipple to move the guns and crews from the Continental Navy ships in port on shore to reinforce the land batteries and repulse the expected British assault.

However, after a rugged four-month siege, the overwhelming pressure of British arms forced the Continental forces to surrender on May 12, 1780. Whipple remained a prisoner of war of the British until he was paroled to Chester, Pennsylvania, at which point he took no further part in the war. Upon the conclusion of hostilities, Whipple took up farming near Cranston, Rhode Island.

==Later life==


For the rest of his life, he remained a farmer, with the exception of two spells of seafaring as master of merchantmen, first of the &quot;General Washington&quot; and then of the &quot;St. Clair&quot;. With the formation of the Ohio Company of Associates in 1788 and the initial westward migration into that territory, Whipple and his family became pioneers on the American frontier and were among the founders of the town of Marietta, Ohio, and the first named proprietor of Charleston, Vermont.

Granted a pension by Congress in recognition of his distinguished service in helping to win American independence, Whipple died at Marietta, Ohio, on May 27, 1819, and was buried at Mound Cemetery in Marietta. His gravestone reads:

Several ships of the United States Navy have been named USS &quot;Whipple&quot; in his honor. There is a Whipple Street, Avenue or Court in almost every one of the 39 municipalities in the State of Rhode Island.

==Fictional references==
* In &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; by H.P. Lovecraft, Capt. Abraham Whipple, one of the &quot;eminent townsmen&quot; of Providence, Rhode Island, led the raid on Joseph Curwen&#x27;s farm. He is also mentioned in &quot;The Shunned House&quot; as a cousin of the narrator&#x27;s great-grandfather. Whipple was an indirect ancestor of Lovecraft&#x27;s, through his grandfather Whipple Van Buren Phillips.

<doc id="500555" wikidata="Q711072" url="?curid=500555" title="Cleopas">
<text>Cleopas (; Greek: Κλεόπας, romanized: &quot;Kleopas&quot;), also spelled Cleophas, was a figure of early Christianity, one of the two disciples who encountered Jesus during the Road to Emmaus appearance in .

==Etymology==
Some writers claim that the name Clopas in John 19:25 (&quot;Mary of Clopas&quot;, &quot;Κλωπᾶς&quot;) is a Hellenized form of a claimed Aramaic name &quot;Qlopha&quot; (קלופא), and that Cleopas&#x27; name (&quot;Κλεόπας&quot;) is an abbreviated form of &quot;Cleopatros&quot; (Κλεόπατρος), a Greek name meaning &quot;glory of the father&quot; (best known in the feminine form Cleopatra).

Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions hold that Clopas, believed to be the brother of Saint Joseph, is the same person as Cleopas. Others consider that Clophas, Cleophas and Alphaeus are all the same name.

==Account in the Gospel of Luke==

Cleopas appears in as one of two disciples walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus. Cleopas is named in verse 18, while his companion remains unnamed.

This occurs three days after the crucifixion, on the same day as the Resurrection of Jesus. The two travelers have heard the tomb of Jesus was found empty earlier that day, but have not yet believed the women&#x27;s testimony. They are discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asks them what they are discussing. &quot;Their eyes were kept from recognizing him.&quot; He rebukes them for their unbelief and offers them an interpretation of scriptural prophecies concerning the Messiah. They ask the stranger to join them for the evening meal. When he breaks the bread &quot;their eyes were opened&quot; and they recognize him as the resurrected Jesus. Jesus immediately vanishes.

Cleopas and his friend hasten back to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples, and learn Jesus has also appeared to [one of] them. The same event is recorded in .

==Apocryphal books==
The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, which was probably written in the seventh century, states that Mary of Clopas was daughter of Clopas and Anna:

The most common interpretation is that &quot;of Clopas&quot; indicates the husband of Mary of Clopas and subsequently the father of her children, but some see &quot;of Clopas&quot; as meaning this Mary&#x27;s father. Medieval tradition saw Clopas as the second husband of Saint Anne and the &quot;father&quot; of &quot;Mary of Clopas&quot;.

Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions believed that Clopas is a brother of Saint Joseph, and that he is the same person with Cleophas.

==Traditions==
Cleopas has no further occurrence in the New Testament, but in tradition he has often been identified with Clopas, another New Testament figure mentioned in John&#x27;s Gospel.

The historian, Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea, quotes the earlier chronicler, Hegesippus, who wrote, c. AD 180, that he had years before interviewed the grandsons of Jude the Apostle and learned that Clopas was the brother of Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary: &quot;After the martyrdom of James, it was unanimously decided that Simeon, son of Clopas, was worthy to occupy the see of Jerusalem. He was, it is said, a cousin of the Saviour.&quot; Hegesippus noted that Clopas was a brother of Joseph. Epiphanius adds that Joseph and Cleopas were brothers, sons of &quot;Jacob, surnamed Panther&quot;.

According to the surviving fragments of the work &quot;Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord&quot; of the Apostolic Father Papias of Hierapolis, who lived c. 70–163 AD, Cleophas and Alphaeus are the same person: &quot;Mary the wife of Cleophas or Alphaeus, who was the mother of James the bishop and apostle, and of Simon and Thaddeus, and of one Joseph&quot;. The Anglican theologian J.B. Lightfoot regarded the fragment quoted above as spurious.

Cleopas is remembered on 30 October in the Eastern Orthodox Church, commemorated on 25 September in the latest official edition of the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;, and on 10 November in the Coptic Orthodox Church.

The entry in the Roman Martyrology now summarizes in substance Luke&#x27;s account of the Emmaus encounter with Jesus.

<text>Mount Pinatubo is an active stratovolcano in the Zambales Mountains in Luzon in the Philippines. Located on the tripoint of Zambales, Tarlac and Pampanga provinces, most people were unaware of its eruptive history before the pre-eruption volcanic activity in early 1991. Dense forests, which supported a population of several thousand indigenous Aetas, heavily eroded and obscured Pinatubo.

Pinatubo is known for its VEI-6 eruption on June 15, 1991, the second-largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska. The eruption coincided with Typhoon Yunya making landfall in the Philippines, which brought a dangerous mix of ash and rain to nearby towns and cities. Early predictions led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people, saving many lives. The eruption severely damaged surrounding areas with pyroclastic surges, pyroclastic falls, and later, flooding lahars caused by rainwater re-mobilizing volcanic deposits. This destruction affected infrastructure and altered river systems for years. Minor dome-forming eruptions inside the caldera continued from 1992 to 1993.

The 1991 eruption had worldwide effects. It released roughly or of magma, bringing large amounts of minerals and toxic metals to the surface. It also released of . It ejected more particulate into the stratosphere than any eruption since Krakatoa in 1883. In the following months, aerosols formed a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. Global temperatures dropped by about in the years 1991–1993, and ozone depletion temporarily increased significantly.

==Geography==
The volcano is about northwest of Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Near Mount Pinatubo are former military bases that were maintained by the United States. The U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay was south of Pinatubo, and the extent of Clark Air Base was just east of the volcano&#x27;s summit. The volcano is near to about 6 million people.

==History==
Even before the 1991 eruption, Mount Pinatubo had little topographic prominence: it was above sea level, only about above nearby plains, and only about higher than surrounding peaks, which largely obscured it from view. It is part of a chain of volcanoes which lie along the western side of the island of Luzon called the Zambales Mountains.

Pinatubo belongs to the Cabusilan sub-range of the Zambales Mountains, which consists of Mount Cuadrado, Mount Negron, Mount Mataba and Mount Pinatubo. They are subduction volcanoes, formed by the Eurasian plate sliding under the Philippine Mobile Belt along the Manila Trench to the west. Mount Pinatubo and the other volcanoes on this volcanic belt arise due to magmatic occlusion from this subduction plate boundary.

Pinatubo is flanked on the west by the Zambales Ophiolite Complex, which is an easterly-dipping section of Eocene oceanic crust uplifted during the late Oligocene. The Tarlac Formation north, east and southeast of Pinatubo consists of marine, nonmarine and volcanoclastic sediments formed in the late Miocene and Pliocene.

The most recent study of Mount Pinatubo before the activities of 1991 was the overall geological study in 1983 and 1984 made by F. G. Delfin for the Philippine National Oil Company as part of the surface investigations of the area before exploratory drilling and well testing for geothermal energy sources in 1988 to 1990. He recognized two life histories of the mountain, which he classified as &quot;ancestral&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; Pinatubo.

===Ancestral Pinatubo===

Activity of Ancestral Pinatubo seems to have begun about 1.1 million years ago and probably ended tens of thousands of years or more before the birth of &quot;modern&quot; Pinatubo. Much of the rugged land around the present volcano consists of remnants of &quot;ancestral&quot; Pinatubo. It was an andesite and dacite stratovolcano whose eruptive activity was much less explosive than modern Pinatubo. Its center was roughly where the current volcano is. The projected height of the mountain is up to , or 1.43 miles above sea level if it were a lone peak, based on a profile fitting to the remaining lower slopes, or lower if it had more than one peak.

The old volcano is exposed in the walls of an old wide caldera, referred to as &quot;Tayawan Caldera&quot; by Delfin. Some of the nearby peaks are the remnants of ancestral Pinatubo, left behind when the softer parts of the old mountain slopes were eroded by weathering. Ancestral Pinatubo is a somma volcano with modern Pinatubo as the new cone.
Mount Dorst, to the east, is part of the dip slope of the ancestral Pinatubo. Several mountains near modern Pinatubo are old satellite vents of ancestral Pinatubo, forming volcanic plugs and lava domes. These satellite vents were probably active around the same time as the ancestral volcano and include the domes of Mount Negron, Mount Cuadrado, Mount Mataba and the Bituin and Tapungho plugs.

===Modern Pinatubo===
* c. 79,000 BC: After a long period of dormancy, Modern Pinatubo was born in Ancestral Pinatubo&#x27;s cataclysmic and most explosive eruptions, estimated to be five times larger than the June 1991 eruption. It deposited all around the volcano up to of pyroclastic surge material up to thick. The total volume of volcanic material ejected during the eruptions is unknown. The removal of so much material from the underlying magma chamber resulted in the Tayawan caldera. The violent eruptive period started by the eruption is referred to by Delfin as the &quot;Inararo Eruptive Period&quot;, named after a village that was destroyed in the 1991 eruption.

Later eruptions of modern Pinatubo occurred episodically and lasted for periods much shorter than the repose intervals between them. Subsequent eruptions and eruptive period occurred about:
*c. 15,000 BC (Sacobia Eruptive Period)
*c. 7000 BC (Pasbul Eruptive Period). Its eruptions were as energetic, if not as voluminous as the Inararo eruptions. 
*c. 4000–3000 BC (Crow Valley Eruptive Period). This and the Mara-unot period&#x27;s eruptions were smaller than the Inararo eruptions but about two to three times as big as that of 1991 based on the pyroclastic flow runout distances and depths of valley filling.
*c. 1900–300 BC (Maraunot Eruptive Period)
*c. AD 1500 (Buag Eruptive Period). Its eruptions were roughly the same size as those of 1991.

Each of these eruptions seems to have been very large, ejecting more than of material and covering large parts of the surrounding areas with pyroclastic flow deposits. Some eruptive periods have lasted decades and perhaps as much as several centuries and might appear to include multiple large explosive eruptions.

The maximum size of eruptions in each eruptive period though has been getting smaller through the more than 35,000-year history of modern Pinatubo, but this might be an artifact of erosion and burial of older deposits. The oldest eruption of modern Pinatubo, Inararo, was also its largest.

The 1991 eruption was among the smallest documented in its geologic record.

The volcano has never grown very large between eruptions, because it produces mostly unwelded, easily erodible deposits and periodically destroys the viscous domes that fill its vents. After the Buag eruption (c. 1500 AD), the volcano lay dormant, its slopes becoming completely covered in dense rainforest and eroded into gullies and ravines. The c. 500-year repose though between the Buag and present eruptive periods is among the shorter repose periods recognized in its geologic history.

====1991 eruption====

A small blast at 03:41 PST on June 12 marked the beginning of a new, more violent phase of the eruption. A few hours later the same day, massive blasts lasting about half an hour generated big eruption columns, which quickly reached heights of over and which generated large pyroclastic surges extending up to from the summit in some river valleys. Fourteen hours later, a 15-minute blast hurled volcanic matter to heights of . Friction in the up-rushing ash column generated abundant volcanic lightning.

In March and April 1991, magma rising toward the surface from more than beneath Pinatubo triggered small volcano tectonic earthquakes and caused powerful steam explosions that blasted three craters on the north flank of the volcano. Thousands of small earthquakes occurred beneath Pinatubo through April, May and early June and many thousand of tons of noxious sulfur dioxide gas were also emitted by the volcano.

From June 7 to 12, the first magma reached the surface of Mount Pinatubo. Because it had lost most of the gas contained in it on the way to the surface, the magma oozed out to form a lava dome but did not cause an explosive eruption. However, on June 12, millions of cubic yards of gas-charged magma reached the surface and exploded in the reawakening volcano&#x27;s first spectacular eruption.

When even more highly gas-charged magma reached Pinatubo&#x27;s surface on June 15, the volcano exploded in a cataclysmic eruption that ejected more than of material. The ash cloud from this climactic eruption rose into the atmosphere. At lower altitudes, the volcanic ash was blown in all directions by the intense cyclonic winds of a coincidentally occurring typhoon, and winds at higher altitudes blew the ash southwestward. A blanket of ash and larger pumice lapilli blanketed the countryside. Fine ash fell as far away as the Indian Ocean and satellites tracked the ash cloud several times around the globe.

Huge pyroclastic flows roared down the flanks of Mount Pinatubo, filling once-deep valleys with fresh volcanic deposits as much as thick. The eruption removed so much magma and rock from below the volcano that the summit collapsed to form a wide caldera.

Following the climactic eruption of June 15, 1991, activity at the volcano continued at a much lower level, with continuous ash eruptions lasting until August 1991 and episodic eruptions continuing for another month.

====Later eruptions====
Activity at the volcano remained low until July 1992 when a new lava dome started growing in the caldera. Volcanologists suspected that further violent eruptions could be possible, and some areas were evacuated. However, the eruption was only minor. The last eruption of Mount Pinatubo took place in 1993.

====Lake Pinatubo====
The 1991 caldera afterwards filled with water from annual monsoon rains and a crater lake, Lake Pinatubo, was formed. In 1992, a growing lava dome formed an island, which was eventually submerged by the lake. Initially, the lake was hot and highly acidic, with a minimum pH of 2 and a temperature of about . Subsequent rainfall cooled and diluted the lake, lowering the temperature to and raising the pH to 5.5 by 2003.

The lake deepened by about per month on average, eventually submerging the lava dome, until September 2001, when fears that the walls of the crater might be unstable prompted the Philippine government to order a controlled draining of the lake. An estimated 9,000 people were once again evacuated from surrounding areas in case a large flood was accidentally triggered. Workers cut a notch in the crater rim and drained about a quarter of the lake&#x27;s volume.

===Recent activity===
On July 10, 2002, the west wall of the crater collapsed, slowly releasing approximately of water and sediment into the Maraunot River in Botolan, Zambales.

On July 26, 2011, a 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck close to Pinatubo; however, no major damages or casualties were reported.

On March 4, 2021, the PHIVOLCS raised alert level 1 over Mount Pinatubo after reporting an increase on its seismic activity. 1,722 volcanic earthquakes were also recorded within the vicinity of the volcano since January 2021.

On August 11, 2021, PHIVOLCS downgraded Mt. Pinatubo&#x27;s Alert Level 1 to Level 0, due to &quot;continued decrease in earthquake activity and a return to baseline seismic parameters&quot;.

PHIVOLCS said it noted a &quot;significant decrease&quot; in volcanic earthquakes, with a total of 104 quakes or an average 2–3 events per day recorded from July 1 – August 1, 2021.

On November 30, 2021, PHIVOLCS reported a weak explosion occurred on Mt. Pinatubo between 12:09 p.m. and 12:13 p.m., which produced a plume. The agency later confirmed it was a phreatic explosion produced by hydrothermal fluids near the surface, rather than a magmatic eruption.

==Cultural history==
The word &quot;pinatubo&quot; could mean &quot;fertile place where one can make crops grow&quot;, or could mean &quot;made to grow&quot;, in Sambal and Tagalog, which may suggest a knowledge of its previous eruption in about 1500 AD. There is a local oral tradition suggestive of a folk memory of earlier large eruptions. An ancient legend tells of Bacobaco, a terrible spirit of the sea, who could metamorphose into a huge turtle and throw fire from his mouth. In the legend, when being chased by the spirit hunters, Bacobaco flees to the mountain and digs a great hole in its summit showering the surrounding land with rock, mud, dust and fire for three days; howling so loudly that the earth shakes.

===History among Aetas===
Aeta elders tell many stories about the history of the mountain, the best known being that it was once a Batung Mabye (Kapampangan language for &quot;living stone&quot;). It was said to have been planted on a kingdom by a displeased sorcerer but relocated by a hero. The mountain was soon turned into the abode of Apo Namalyari (&quot;The lord of happenings/events&quot;), the pagan deity of the Sambal, Aetas and Kapampangans living on the Zambales range.

It was said to comprise the whole mountain range until Sinukuan of Mount Arayat (the god of the Kapampangans) became a strong rival of Namalyari. Their fight, which took place over the center plains, shattered the mountain into smaller bodies and Mount Arayat lost its center peak. Other versions have it that Pinatubo&#x27;s peak shattered because of Namalyari&#x27;s immense fury in an attempt to teach humans the meaning of fear and show how misdeeds will be punished.

According to the native elders, Apo Namalyari induced the June 1991 eruption because of displeasure toward illegal loggers and Philippine National Oil Company executives who performed deep exploratory drilling and well testing on the volcano looking for geothermal heat from 1988 to 1990. Discouraging results from the wells forced the abandonment of the prospect 13 months before the April 2, 1991, explosions.

==Aetas granted ownership of Pinatubo==
After being driven away by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, in May 2009 some 454 Aeta families in Pampanga were given the first clean ancestral land ownership on Mount Pinatubo with the Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), the government agency that deals with issues concerning indigenous people of the Philippines. The approved and declared net land area of covers the barangays of Mawakat and Nabuklod in Floridablanca, Pampanga, plus a portion of San Marcelino, Zambales, and a portion of Barangay Batiawan in Subic, Zambales.

On January 14, 2010, some 7,000 Aeta families from Zambales were officially granted the Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) covering the Zambales side of Pinatubo which includes the summit and Lake Pinatubo, officially becoming their &quot;lutan tua&quot; (ancestral land). The ancestral domain title covers and includes the villages of Burgos, Villar, Moraza and Belbel in Botolan and portions of the towns of Cabangan, San Felipe and San Marcelino.

Ancestral domain titles are awarded to a certain community or indigenous group who have occupied or possessed the land continuously in accordance with their customs and traditions since time immemorial. They have the legal right to collectively possess and to enjoy the land and its natural resources to the exclusion of others. Having the land title will protect them from others – including foreigners – exploiting their land without compensation to and consent from the indigenous tribes. In the past, the Aetas had to contend with mining companies, loggers, and recently, tourist companies who earn from Mount Pinatubo but do not compensate the local tribes.

==In popular culture==

Long before Mount Pinatubo became famous for its cataclysmic eruption, Philippine president Ramon Magsaysay, a native of Zambales, named his C-47 presidential plane &quot;Mt. Pinatubo&quot;. The plane crashed into Mount Manunggal in Cebu province in 1957, killing the president and twenty-four others on board.

The shape of Mount Pinatubo&#x27;s caldera inspired New Clark City Athletics Stadium in Capas, Tarlac.

==Hiking activity==
The caldera formed and Lake Pinatubo has, since June 15, 1991, become a tourist attraction with the preferred route through Barangay Santa Juliana in Capas, Tarlac.

==Biodiversity==

===Mammals===

The Long-nosed forest mouse (Apomys sacobianus) is a species of rodent endemic to Mount Pinatubo, Philippines.

The Zambales forest mouse (Apomys zambalensis) is a species of rodent endemic to Zambales Mountain Range, Philippines.

<doc id="500564" wikidata="Q2055103" url="?curid=500564" title="Bona Drag">
<text>Bona Drag is a compilation album by the English singer Morrissey, released on 15 October 1990 by His Master&#x27;s Voice. The album features an array of Morrissey&#x27;s most popular songs from his early solo career, most of which had not been released on any previous album. The album name meaning &quot;nice outfits&quot; is an example of the subculture slang Polari explored further on the album&#x27;s first track &quot;Piccadilly Palare&quot;. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on 6 December 2000. In 2010, the album was remastered and expanded to include six bonus tracks.

== Background ==
After releasing &quot;Viva Hate&quot; in March 1988, Morrissey modified his method of releasing music. Instead of choosing to produce an immediate follow-up album, he decided to release a string of stand-alone singles in the hopes of achieving success in that market. Morrissey initially planned to release a second album after releasing a few holdover singles.

As such, he released &quot;The Last of the Famous International Playboys&quot;, &quot;Interesting Drug&quot;, and &quot;Ouija Board, Ouija Board&quot; over the course of 1989. The first two of these became top ten hits. However, by the end of 1989 it became apparent that he would not be able to put out an album of new material soon enough.

Morrissey decided to scrap the idea of a full-length LP and release a compilation of singles and B-sides instead. Thus, the &quot;Bona Drag&quot; project was born. &quot;November Spawned a Monster&quot; was released in May 1990 to modest success; the album and the single &quot;Piccadilly Palare&quot; followed, both released on the same day that October. Morrissey explained, &quot;People will view it suspiciously in England but not in the rest of the world where all those funny little singles were never released. It was initially for the rest of the world, but EMI were determined to release it here.&quot;

===Composition===
&quot;Bona Drag&quot; features all of Morrissey&#x27;s solo singles up to that point, two of which (&quot;Suedehead&quot; and &quot;Everyday Is Like Sunday&quot;) were taken from his first solo album &quot;Viva Hate&quot;, while the others were making their first ever appearance on an album. Four of these singles were Top Ten hits. The album also includes several B-sides, none of which had appeared on an album before.

The album is also significant for including the first tracks by Morrissey to chart in the United States. &quot;Piccadilly Palare&quot; and &quot;Ouija Board, Ouija Board&quot; both reached number 2 on the Modern Rock chart. &quot;The Last of the Famous International Playboys&quot; went to number 3, &quot;November Spawned a Monster&quot;, number 6, and &quot;Interesting Drug&quot;, number 11. &quot;Bona Drag&quot; launched Morrissey&#x27;s career in the US, and in many ways it marked the turning point after which he became less popular in the UK but achieved increasing success in America.

The album sleeve is taken from Morrissey&#x27;s &quot;November Spawned a Monster&quot; promotion video. Morrissey&#x27;s shirt colour was altered from black to red.

===20th anniversary reissue===
In October 2010, the album was reissued on the resurrected Major Minor label, with six officially unreleased studio recordings. The artwork was edited and inner artwork updated with previously unseen photos chosen by Morrissey. It entered the UK charts at number 67. The reissue notably included several edits, including removing a verse from &#x27;Ouija Board, Ouija Board&#x27; and restoring a previously-cut verse to &#x27;Piccadilly Palare&#x27;.

<doc id="500570" wikidata="Q665365" url="?curid=500570" title="Bremen Airport">
<text>Bremen Airport (German: &quot;Flughafen Bremen&quot;, ) is the international airport of the city and state of Bremen in Northern Germany. It is located south of the city and handled 1,81 Mio. passengers in 2023. It mainly features flights to European metropolitan and leisure destinations.

==History==
===Early years===
The beginnings of the airport date back to the early 20th century. The &quot;Bremer Verein für Luftschiffahrt&quot;, a local aerospace club, conducted the first experimental flights at the present site in the summer of 1910, on what was then the parade ground of the local garrison. The Senate of Bremen supported the establishment of an airfield to connect Bremen to the growing airship route network. Official permission for the opening of an airport was granted on 16 May 1913. The initial infrastructure was geared towards aircraft operations instead of the initially envisaged airships. Several wooden hangars were erected.

During World War I, the airport was taken into military administration, and civilian operations ceased. The military erected a wooden hangar, but conducted only a small number of operations from the airfield. After the war, the airport only reopened on 18 July 1920, with Dutch airline KLM beginning scheduled flights to Amsterdam soon thereafter. In the same year, the Weimar National Assembly authorised investment into upgraded facilities at the airport. Administration of the airport was transferred to the newly founded &quot;Bremer Flughafengesellschaft&quot;. In 1923, the aeroplane manufacturer Focke-Wulf was founded on a site adjacent to the airfield.

===World War II===
In the 1930s, several new terminal buildings and hangars were constructed, with the largest to date being completed in 1937. In the same year, four new runways were built. These were arranged in a star-like pattern. The increasing military buildup under the rule of the Nazis also began to show itself at the airport, with the Luftwaffe establishing a flight training base there. Civilian operations again came to a standstill with the beginning of World War II. For a short period between November 1939 and June 1940, the airport served as the base for a squadron of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 bombers. In the later stages of the war, the airport came under repeated bombardment due to co-location with the Focke-Wulf plant. This left most of the infrastructure destroyed or severely damaged by the end of the war.

The United States Army took over the airport and the adjacent aircraft plant in 1945 for use as an airbase. After conducting the necessary repairs, it operated mostly transport aircraft into and out of the American enclave within otherwise British-occupied northern Germany. Control was handed back to the Bremen authorities in 1949. Civilian operations resumed that year with Scandinavian Airlines using Bremen Airport as a stopover on routes from Scandinavia to Geneva and Vienna. Runway 09-27 was extended to 2.000 m.

===Development since the 1950s===
In the mid-1950s, the terminal buildings were reconstructed and Lufthansa began scheduled flights to the airport. The German airline also established its pilot training operations (Lufthansa Flight Training) at the airport. During the 1960s, scheduled jet flights began to be operated at Bremen. In 1971, a large radar system was installed on the southern perimeter of the airport.

1989 was the first year that the airport had more than one million passengers. The current terminal building was opened in 1998.

In January 2016 the airport&#x27;s operator announced that the main terminal building would undergo major redesign and renovation works until 2018. Terminal sections 1, 2 and 3 were merged amongst several other changes. In May 2016 the airport introduced its new brand with &quot;BRE Bremen Airport&quot; replacing &quot;City Airport Bremen&quot; .

In February 2017 British Airways announced it would end its flights from Bremen to London and Manchester, which were both operated by SUN-AIR. SUN-AIR maintained a base for the routes at Bremen Airport. In April 2017 the airport announced it was changing its name to Bremen Airport Hans Koschnick, after the former mayor and honorable citizen of Bremen.

In October 2018, Ryanair announced it would be closing its base at the airport on 5 November 2018. In February 2021, Lufthansa Aviation Training announced it would relocate its entire German practical training from Bremen Airport to Rostock Airport. In 2023 and 2024, Bremen Airport gained two important additional hub connections when Lufthansa Group Airlines SWISS and Austrian Airlines began scheduled routes to their hubs in Zürich and Vienna, respectively.

==Facilities==
The airport consists of one main passenger terminal building, split into sections &quot;Terminal 1, 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; that features several shops, restaurants and service facilities as well five aircraft stands equipped with jet bridges and some additional stands for mid-sized aircraft on the apron. The main building contains the check-in counters 5–19 and 21–38. Ryanair uses another more basic facility to the west of the main terminal called &quot;Terminal E&quot; which only features walk-boarding and features the check-in counters 1E-4E.

The &quot;Bremenhalle&quot; inside the airport hosts a small aviation and space exploration museum, displaying the Junkers W33 &quot;Bremen&quot; and the first Spacelab module.

Bremen airport is the home airport of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) two Basler BT-67 research aircraft &quot;Polar 5&quot; and &quot;Polar 6&quot;. The AWI fleet was relocated to Bremen after Bremerhaven Airport was closed in 2016.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at Bremen Airport:

<doc id="500578" wikidata="Q2920659" url="?curid=500578" title="Cabinet secretary">
<text>A cabinet secretary is usually a senior official (typically a civil servant) who provides services and advice to a cabinet of ministers as part of the Cabinet Office. In many countries, the position can have considerably wider functions and powers, including general responsibility for the entire civil service.

The title of cabinet secretary may also be used as an alternative term for a politically appointed cabinet minister, derived from secretary of state—the formal title for ministers. This naming convention is used in Japan, Kenya, Scotland and the United States.

==Parliamentary systems==

=== Australia ===
In Australia the equivalent position is the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, although both the department and its secretary have wider responsibilities than in most other governments derived from the Westminster System.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison established a position entitled Cabinet Secretary in August 2019 within the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office responsible for cabinet operations and appointed a former senior political adviser and intelligence official Andrew Shearer to the role.

The Cabinet Secretary is also a title conferred on an Australian minister responsible for assisting the prime minister to manage the day-to-day procedural and operational matters of the Cabinet and any Cabinet committees. As per all other ministers in the Westminster system, the Cabinet Secretary is a sitting member of Parliament, chosen by the Prime Minister and officially appointed by the Governor-General. The Cabinet Secretary is a portfolio minister of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and has existed at various stages since 2007.

Australia&#x27;s states and territories have equivalent officials

* New South Wales: Secretary of the Cabinet Office
* Victoria: Secretary of the Department of Premier and Cabinet
* Queensland: Director-General of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet
* South Australia: Chief Executive of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet
* Western Australia: Director General of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet
* Tasmania: Secretary and Head of the State Service
* Australian Capital Territory: Director General of the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate
* Northern Territory: Cabinet Secretary

=== Canada ===
In Canada the equivalent position is the Clerk of the Privy Council, who functions as Deputy Minister to the prime minister of Canada and heads the Privy Council Office. Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories also have equivalent officials as the head of their respective public services, as in the list below:
* Alberta: Deputy Minister of Executive Council and Secretary to the Cabinet
* British Columbia: Deputy Minister to the Premier and Cabinet Secretary
* Manitoba: Clerk of the Executive Council
* New Brunswick: Clerk of the Executive Council and Secretary to Cabinet
* Newfoundland and Labrador: Clerk of the Executive Council and Secretary to the Cabinet
* Nova Scotia: the head of the civil service is the Clerk of the Executive Council, while the Secretary to the Cabinet is a separate position.
* Ontario: Secretary of the Cabinet and Clerk of the Executive Council
* Prince Edward Island: the head of the civil service is the Clerk of the Executive Council, while the Premier&#x27;s Principal Secretary advises the Premier and Cabinet on matters of policy and strategy
* Quebec: &quot;Secrétaire général du Conseil exécutif&quot; (Secretary General of the Executive Council)
* Saskatchewan: Deputy Minister to the Premier and Cabinet Secretary
* Northwest Territories: Secretary to the Cabinet
* Nunavut: Secretary to Cabinet
* Yukon: Cabinet Secretary and Deputy Minister of the Executive Council Office

=== India ===
The Cabinet Secretariat is under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. The administrative head of the Cabinet Secretariat is the Cabinet Secretary who is also the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board, and thus the head of the Indian Administrative Service.
As a matter of convention the senior most civil servant is appointed as a Cabinet Secretary. He or she belongs to the Indian Administrative Service. The incumbent generally has a tenure of two to three years. Though there is no fixed tenure. His or her tenure however, can be extended.
The Cabinet Secretary is the head of all the civil services under the constitution which is the All India Civil Services and the Central Civil Services (Grade A and Grade B). His status in the Indian order of precedence is equivalent to that of the Attorney General of India and just above chiefs of staff or equivalent in the armed services holding the rank of full general.

The functions of the Cabinet Secretary in India are:

# Provide assistance to the Council of Ministers
# Act as advisor and conscience keeper of the civil services
# Handle senior appointments
# Prepare the agenda of the Cabinet
# Attend the meetings of the Cabinet
# Ensure that the Cabinet decisions are implemented
# Advise the Prime Minister
# Act as the Chairman of the Committee of Secretaries on Administration
# Act as the Chairman of the Chief Secretaries Committee
# Provide an element of continuity and stability to administration during crises

The Cabinet Secretariat is responsible for the administration of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961 and the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules 1961, facilitating smooth transaction of business in Ministries/Departments of the Government by ensuring adherence to these rules. The Secretariat assists in decision-making in Government by ensuring Inter-Ministerial coordination, ironing out differences amongst Ministries/Departments and evolving consensus through the instrumentality of the standing/ad hoc Committees of Secretaries. Through this mechanism new policy initiatives are also promoted.

The Cabinet Secretariat ensures that the president of India, the vice-president and Ministers are kept informed of the major activities of all Departments by means of a monthly summary of their activities. Management of major crisis situations in the country and coordinating activities of the various Ministries in such a situation is also one of the functions of the Cabinet Secretariat.

The Cabinet Secretary is arguably India&#x27;s most powerful bureaucrat.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland the position of Cabinet Secretary is officially titled Secretary-General to the Government (previously titled &quot;Secretary to the Government&quot;), and is concurrently Secretary-General of the Department of the Taoiseach, somewhat analogous to the Cabinet Office in the United Kingdom. This department provides the secretariat to the Cabinet and co-ordinates the Government Press Office. It also has some policy functions with regard to key areas such as Northern Ireland, economic policy, and public service modernisation. The role is modeled on, and is broadly similar to, the UK equivalent, though in recent times has become more constrained by the seven-year time limit placed on Secretaries General in the mid-1990s following the introduction of the Strategic Management Initiative.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, the Cabinet Secretary heads an office responsible for preparing the agenda of cabinet meetings and facilitating communication between ministers. The secretariat is also responsible for presenting government-initiated bills to the Knesset and for conducting certain press briefings. The secretary is appointed on the recommendation of the prime minister, with the current secretary being Yossi Fuchs.

===Japan===
In Japan the office of Chief cabinet secretary has been made into a ministerial post, being held by a member of the House of Representatives. This is unusual, as most countries give the position to a civil servant. The chief cabinet secretary performs much the same role as other cabinet secretaries; however, he or she is responsible for overseeing the administrative operations of Cabinet, and presiding over the Cabinet Secretariat. The post has the added function of being the government&#x27;s chief press secretary.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand the Cabinet Secretary is part of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which provides assistance, coordination, and advice. The Cabinet Secretary also serves as Clerk of the Executive Council, the formal body on which Cabinet rests. The office of Cabinet Secretary is somewhat anomalous, by New Zealand standards, in that it is partly autonomous from the department to which it belongs. The role does not, however, have the broad powers given to its British equivalent – for example, authority over the civil service is held by the State Services Commissioner, a separate official.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan the Cabinet Secretary is a senior civil servant who is responsible for running the Cabinet Division.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK Government the Cabinet Secretary is the most senior civil servant in the country, providing policy advice to the prime minister and Cabinet. The role is currently occupied by Sir Chris Wormald, appointed in December 2024 following the resignation of Simon Case.

From 1981 to 2011, the position of Cabinet Secretary had been combined with the roles of Head of the Home Civil Service and Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary. The first means that the Cabinet Secretary is responsible for all the civil servants of the various departments within government (except the Foreign Office), chairing the Permanent Secretaries Management Group (PSMG) which is the principal governing body of the civil service. The second means that the Cabinet Secretary is responsible for leading the government department that provides administrative support to the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The post is appointed by the prime minister with the advice of the out-going Cabinet Secretary and the First Civil Service Commissioner.

With the retirement of Gus O&#x27;Donnell, who served from 2005 until the end of 2011, the three roles hitherto performed by the Cabinet Secretary were split: the Cabinet Secretary would provide policy advice to the Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Head of the Home Civil Service would provide leadership for the whole Civil Service; and the Permanent Secretary would oversee the Cabinet Office. O&#x27;Donnell was succeeded by Jeremy Heywood as Cabinet Secretary, Bob Kerslake as Head of the Home Civil Service and Permanent Secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government and Ian Watmore as lastly, Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary.

The responsibilities of the job vary from time to time and depend very much on the personal qualities of both the prime minister and Cabinet Secretary of the day. In most cases the true influence of the Cabinet Secretary extends far beyond administrative matters, and reaches to the very heart of the decision-making process. For instance, the Cabinet Secretary is responsible for administering the Ministerial Code which governs the conduct of ministers (also known as &quot;the Rule Book&quot; and formerly &quot;Questions of Procedure for Ministers&quot;). In this duty the Cabinet Secretary may be asked to investigate leaks within government, and enforce Cabinet discipline. This gives the unelected Cabinet Secretary some authority over elected ministers (a situation satirised in the BBC sitcom &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;).

The Cabinet Secretary is responsible for overseeing the intelligence services and their relationship to the government, though since 2002 this responsibility has been delegated to a full-time role (initially as Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator, now the Head of Intelligence, Security and Resilience working to the National Security Adviser), with the Cabinet Secretary focussing on civil service reforms to help deliver the government&#x27;s policy programme.

====Devolved governments====

The term cabinet secretary is currently also used to refer to the senior cabinet members of the Scottish and Welsh governments.

Following the 2007 General Election of the devolved Scottish Parliament, the new First Minister Alex Salmond restyled the Scottish Executive to be branded as the Scottish Government, whilst senior ministers were re-titled from ministers to cabinet secretaries. Similarly, junior ministers were re-titled from deputy ministers to minister.

The Welsh Government followed suit in 2016 under first minister Carwyn Jones, in order to reflect the government&#x27;s expansion of powers in recent years. It reverted back to the original names from 2018 to 2024 under Mark Drakeford, before returning to the cabinet secretary titles under Vaughan Gething.

==Presidential systems==

=== China ===
The Secretary-General of the State Council is an executive position within the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It ranks below the Premier and above the Ministers of various ministries and departments. The current secretary general is State Councilor Xiao Jie. The Secretary-General is responsible for the day-to-day work of the State Council and is in charge of the State Council General Office.

==== Hong Kong, China ====
In Hong Kong there is a politically appointed Director of the Chief Executive&#x27;s Office, as well as a Permanent Secretary who is a civil servant.

The position of Director was first established in 2002 as part of the &#x27;Principal Officials Accountability System&#x27;, and it was not clear whether it was a politically appointed or a civil service position. Nevertheless, its salary level was tied to that of permanent secretaries (Point 8 of the Directorate Payscale) instead of that of politically appointed secretaries. The first office holder Lam Woon Kwong was a civil servant who opted for early retirement directly from this position in January 2005; and therefore did not subsequently take up any civil service or politically appointed position. Lam was not the most senior Administrative Officer and the position did not provide him any seniority over other permanent secretaries.

It was until January 2006, that the appointment of John Tsang to the position confirmed the position as a politically appointed office. Prior to his appointment, John Tsang was a politically appointed secretary, as the Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology. In July 2007, as part of the expansion of the political appointment system to introduce two layers of politically appointed junior secretaries, the salary level of the position was changed to tie with that of politically appointed secretaries. The office holder is also officially given the duty to co-ordinate the works of different bureaus (as Hong Kong ministries are known since 1997), making the office holder politically more powerful, regardless of his or her seniority.

The position of Permanent Secretary was first created as a non-permanent position supernumerary post from August 2005 to January 2006, while the position of the Director was left vacant. The salary level was set as the same as other Permanent Secretaries, i.e. Point 8 of the Directorate Pay Scale, aka the D8 rank. From February 2006 onwards, the post became permanent but the salary level was changed to D6, which is lower than Permanent Secretaries in the then 11 bureaux. The office is never filled by the most senior administrative officer as in other countries.

Unlike other countries, the Clerk of the Executive Council is a separate position, filled by an administrative officer of the D2 rank. The office holder nevertheless is required to take an oath of secrecy.

=== Indonesia ===
The Cabinet Secretary is called &quot;Sekretaris Kabinet&quot; in Indonesian language, usually act as one of the President&#x27;s spokesperson.

=== Kenya ===
Secretary to the Cabinet
The office of Secretary the Cabinet was established in 1963. The officer was in charge of the Cabinet Office and assisted the Prime Minister in managing cabinet affairs. The Secretary to the Cabinet was appointee of the Governor General, in consultation with the Public Service Commission and the Prime Minister at the time. The position was retained after Kenya became a republic and elevated to Secretary to the cabinet and Head of Public Service, appointed by the President. The officer would be the senior most civil servant, in charge of the Civil Service and the Cabinet Office.
Under the 2010 constitution, the Secretary to the Cabinet is defined as in charge of cabinet office and is appointed by the president subject to parliamentary approval upon vetting. The current holder of the office is Ms.Mercy Wanjau

=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines the Cabinet Secretary was a cabinet-level rank of the Cabinet. Under the present constitution and the initial implementing guidelines pursuant to Executive Order No. 237, series of 1987, the primary mandate was to provide technical support to the Cabinet, primary advisory counsel to the President, as well as the following:

#Assist in providing timely and organized information to the Cabinet on issues and problems submitted for decision and action.
#Provide conference and administrative support services to the Cabinet, the Cabinet Clusters, the Cabinet Assistance System and other committees created by the Cabinet.
#Conduct technical research and special studies on specific policy issues.
#Maintain an efficient records-management system, including a Cabinet Archives and a library.
#Certify Cabinet resolutions that indicate agreements and actions reached during Cabinet meetings.
#Exercise such other functions and powers as may be provided by law or as directed by the President.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka the Cabinet Secretary is the head of the Cabinet Office. The post is held by a civil servant and it is equal to a Permanent Secretary.

=== United States ===


In the United States there is an official called the Cabinet Secretary within the Executive Office of the President charged with maintaining relations between members of the Cabinet and the White House. The position is not a civil service position, instead being subject to presidential appointment. The Cabinet Secretary is Evan Ryan.

However, the term &quot;Cabinet Secretary&quot; is also sometimes used in a generic sense to refer to one of the members of the United States Cabinet, as these people are titled Secretary (e.g., Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense). This usage is not official, and differs from the use in other countries.

<text>Mount Forest is a community in Wellington County, Ontario, Canada. It is known for Chris and Eric and their antics on 88.7 The River and is located at the junction of Highway 6 and Highway 89 and is a part of the township of Wellington North, Ontario, Canada. As of the 2021 Canadian census the population of Mount Forest was 5,040.
==History==

During the survey of the Garafraxa Colonization Road, constructed from Arthur to Georgian Bay in 1840–48, land was reserved for a settlement. By 1851 a post office was established. The village was originally known as Maitland Hills, because it was believed to be on the Maitland River system. This was incorrect; the village is on a height of land near the headwaters of the South Saugeen River.

The settlement was surveyed into lots in 1853 by Francis Kerr, a provincial land surveyor, with the village-plot named Mount Forest. The village straddled the Garafraxa Road leading to early growth. When the United Counties of Wellington and Grey was dissolved in January 1854, Wellington and Grey were separate counties for all purposes, with the village in Arthur Township, Wellington County for electoral purposes. By 1864, the population had grown to 1185 so that it qualified to be incorporated as a village. In 1869, Mount Forest was listed as an &quot;incorporated Village in the Townships of Egremont, Normanby and Arthur&quot; in the County of Wellington, as being &quot;one of the most enterprising villages in the West&quot; with a population of 1700. The townships of Egremont and Normanby were north of town in adjacent Grey County, while south of the town was Arthur Township.

The 1871 town directory stated that Mount Forest had ten hotels, eight churches and 18 stores. Later that year the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway was completed and the first train entered Mount Forest pulled by a wood-burning engine. By 1879, Mount Forest had become an incorporated town.

Mount Forest was amalgamated into the new township of Wellington North on 1 January 1999.

===Media===
A local newspaper, the &quot;Mount Forest Confederate&quot;, was first printed in 1867. For the first year, the newspaper was sent to village residents free of charge, then in the second year for 50 cents annually. It ceased publication in August 2019.

===Hospital===
Dr. A.R. Perry purchased the home of Alex Martin on the corner of Dublin and Princess Streets and established Strathcona Hospital, a 10-bed private hospital. In 1923, a group of citizens headed by G.L. Allen changed Strathcona Hospital into a public hospital. Wentworth Marshall, a pharmacist, generously bought the hospital from Perry. Marshall&#x27;s mother, Louise, was the supervisor at the hospital until she became ill with cancer. It was closed in 1921, but a year later reopened under a new name: Mount Forest General Hospital. In 1928, the deed of the hospital was turned over to the town and the name was changed yet again to Louise Marshall Hospital in honour of Marshall&#x27;s mother.

===Education===
The first public school was built in 1856. The first high school was originally in the Old Drill Hall, but was an unsuitable location because it was beside the Market Square where livestock sales were held monthly.

The new high school was built in 1878. A third high school was founded in 2004, with students from the neighbouring town of Arthur joining those from the Mount Forest district.

==Climate==
Mount Forest features a humid continental climate, characterized by warm, humid sometimes wet summers and long, cold, snowy winters. At an elevation of 430 meters (1,410 ft) above sea level, Mount Forest is one of the highest towns in Southern Ontario being located in the western portion of the Dundalk Highlands. As such, its elevation and location downwind of Lake Huron makes it prone to hefty snow totals from lake effect snow averaging nearly 300 centimetres per year. Summers are often cooler than they otherwise would be due to the town&#x27;s elevation and overnight lows are considerably cooler than places along the lakeshore.


==Culture==
Mount Forest&#x27;s library was completed in 1913 with a grant of $10,000 from well-known philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Mount Forest is also the site of the founding of the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada.

Mount Forest was the first place that Aimee Semple McPherson preached.

The Mount Forest Chamber of Commerce along with the Arthur and Minto Chambers formed a networking group named Northern Wellington Young Professionals in October 2012. This is a group of business owners, entrepreneurs, community leaders, and business leaders between 20 and 40 years old who get together for networking events. It gives local businesses within Northern Wellington Township an opportunity to grow their customer/client base and meet fellow young professionals within the community. Northern Wellington Young Professionals operates out of Mount Forest but holds events in Harriston and Arthur as well.

Mount Forest also hosts a number of different sporting events throughout the year. The Mount Forest Patriots are a local junior &quot;C&quot; hockey club that were very successful through the mid-1990s. The Trillium 10k is an annual race held each May which features 10 km and 5 km running races, a 5 km walk event, and a 10 km inline speed skating race which has been contested by members of the Canadian national team.

==Demographics==
As of the 2021 Canadian Census, Mount Forest has a population of 5,040 people. This represents an increase of 8.6% when compared to the 2016 Canadian Census.

In the first Canadian census in 1871, Mount Forest had a population of 1,370.

Mount Forest saw a lot of growth in the late 19th century, as by 1891, the population of the town was 2,214 people.

From 1901 to 1921, the population of Mount Forest dropped significantly, dropping to a low of 1,718 in 1921.

Following World War II, Mount Forest saw a sharp increase in population, as from 1941-1951, the population rose by 21.1%. By 1971, Mount Forest had 3,037 living in the town.

Mount Forest saw significant growth during the 1980&#x27;s, as the town population increased by nearly 1,000 people between 1981 and 1991.

Mount Forest&#x27;s population broke over 5,000 people in the 2021, as 5,040 people live in the town.

As of the latest census in 2021, the median age in Mount Forest is 49.6 years old. There are 2,250 private dwellings in Mount Forest, with 2,174 of them occupied by usual residents.

The median total income for a household in Mount Forest was $90,000 in 2020.

==Churches==
===United Church of Canada===
Built in 1873, Mount Forest United Church is an important part of the local history of Mount Forest and continues to be one of the most historic, and recognizable landmarks of the area. Today, Mount Forest United Church is one of two congregations in Mount Forest-Woodland Pastoral Charge of the United Church of Canada in what is now Western Ontario Waterways Regional Council (Region 8), and was formerly in Hamilton Conference.

===Methodism===

Methodist circuit riders first began ministering throughout the region in the 1840s, the first being the Reverend John Shilton in 1842. In 1844, Shilton led the construction of the first Methodist place of worship in Mount Forest, on the corner of Highway 6 and Sligo Road. Mount Forest became its own circuit in 1863 with 147 members. In 1852 the Wesleyan Methodist church was built, and in 1874 the two Methodist congregations merged and built a new church on Wellington Street and Elgin Street. Originally costing $16,000, 215 members contributed to the construction of this new building. In 1884, another Methodist community in the area joined this growing congregation. In 1925, the Methodist churches in Canada became one of the founding members of the new United Church of Canada. All of the buildings in Mount Forest which were at one time associated with these Methodist churches have been demolished.

===Presbyterianism===

Presbyterianism in Mount Forest can trace its roots to at least the early 1850s. In 1856 a request was sent to Hamilton Presbytery for a minister as well as permission to erect a church building. A split occurred shortly thereafter and subsequently two churches were built in town: Knox Presbyterian Church was built near the present-day Presbyterian Church, and Saint Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian which was built on the intersection of King Street and Fergus Street. In 1873 and under the guidance of the Reverend John MacMillan, Knox Presbyterian constructed a new church building, what is now known as Mount Forest United Church. The Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Canada laid the corner stone and after the reuniting of the Presbyterian communities in Mount Forest, the name was changed to Westminster Presbyterian. The first organ was installed in 1890, but was replaced in 1910, and again in 1957. In 1925, Westminster Presbyterian joined the United Church of Canada (after a congregational vote of 255 to 32) and the Methodist communities joined them under this one roof.

===Roman Catholicism===

The first Roman Catholic church was a simple log church constructed in 1858, but burnt to the ground the day before its consecration. The current Roman Catholic Church, Saint Mary&#x27;s, was constructed in 1864. Their first priest was Father P.S. Mahuet, and was consecrated by the Bishop of Hamilton, the Most Reverend Doctor Farrell. The rectory was built in 1880 and was converted into a convent housing the Sisters of Saint Joseph, though it was demolished in 2002 to create enough space for their new parish facilities.

<text>Scalpay (; or &quot;Sgalpaigh na Hearadh&quot;; i.e. &quot;Scalpay of Harris&quot; to distinguish it from Scalpay off Skye) is an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.

==Toponym ==
Mac an Tàilleir (2003) suggests the name derives from &quot;ship island&quot; from the Norse. However, Haswell-Smith states that the Old Norse name was &quot;Skalprøy&quot;, meaning &quot;scallop island&quot;.

== Geology and geography==
Scalpay is around long and rises to a height of at Beinn Scorabhaig. The area of Scalpay is . The main settlement on the island is at the north, near the bridge, clustered around &quot;An Acairseid a Tuath&quot; (North Harbour).

The bedrock of northwest and of southeast Scalpay is Archaean gneiss belonging to the Lewisian Complex. Across the centre of the island is a band of mylonite and protocataclasite associated with the Outer Hebrides Thrust Zone. Some restricted occurrences of amphibolite and ultramafic rocks are also present. A number of tholeiitic dykes of Tertiary age cross the island with a NW-SE alignment. Scalpay is largely free from superficial deposits apart from an area of peat in the northeast.
The island is peppered with small lochans. The largest of these is Loch an Duin (Loch of the Fort) which has a tiny island in it, with the remains of the fort still visible. Eilean Glas, a tiny peninsula on Scalpay&#x27;s eastern shore, is home to the first lighthouse to be built in the Outer Hebrides.

Scalpay&#x27;s nearest neighbour, Harris, is just away across the narrows of Caolas Scalpaigh. In 1997, a bridge from Harris to Scalpay was built, replacing a ferry service.

==History==
In 1746, Charles Edward Stuart fled to Scalpay after his forces were defeated at the Battle of Culloden.

Scalpay is home to many Gaelic singers and psalm precentors. The island used to have more than 10 shops over 30 years ago but due to lack of people and work, the last shop closed in 2007. There also used to be a salmon factory, which was a major local employer from 2001 until its closure in 2005. In the spring of 2009, local newspapers reported that the factory was to reopen as a net washing facility to support the local fish farming industry. In 2012, the Scalpay community bought and opened a community shop/café, &quot;Buth Scalpaigh&quot;.

Photographer Marco Secchi lived on Scalpay for few years between 2002–2008 and documented life and landscape of the Outer Hebrides.

In 2011 the island&#x27;s owner, Fred Taylor, announced that he proposed handing over the land to the local population. One proposal was that the island would be owned by a local development trust; under another proposal it would form part of the larger North Harris Trust, itself community owned. Islanders voted to accept the gift and assume community ownership of the island. They will go into partnership with the North Harris Community Trust to run the island.

==Demographics==
In 2001, the island had 322 people, whose main employment was fish farming and prawn fishing. By 2011 the population had declined by 9% to 291 whilst during the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

The vast majority of the locals in Scalpay are Protestants. The island is home to two Presbyterian churches, the Free Church of Scotland and the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing).

<text>Lev Zalmanovich (Zinovyevich) Kopelev (, German: Lew Sinowjewitsch Kopelew, 9 April 1912 – 18 June 1997) was a Soviet author and dissident.

== Early life ==
Kopelev was born in Kyiv, then Russian Empire, to a middle-class Jewish family. In 1926, his family moved to Kharkiv. While a student at Kharkiv State University&#x27;s philosophy faculty, Kopelev began writing in Russian and Ukrainian languages; some of his articles were published in the &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; newspaper.

An idealist communist and active party member, he was first arrested in March 1929 for &quot;consorting with the Bukharinist and Trotskyist opposition,&quot; and spent ten days in prison.

==Career==
Later, he worked as an editor of radio news broadcasts at a locomotive factory. In 1932, as a correspondent, Kopelev witnessed the NKVD&#x27;s forced grain requisitioning and the dekulakization. Later, he described the Holodomor in his memoir &quot;The Education of a True Believer&quot;. Robert Conquest&#x27;s &quot;The Harvest of Sorrow&quot; later quoted him directly (see also Collectivisation in the USSR).

He graduated from the Moscow State Institute of Foreign Languages in 1935 in the German language faculty, and, after 1938, he taught at the where he earned a PhD.

When the German–Soviet War broke out in June 1941, he volunteered for the Red Army and used his knowledge of German to serve as a propaganda officer and an interpreter. He was tasked with subverting and indoctrinating Germans, and on one occasion persuaded the German garrison of Graudenz (Grudziądz) to mutiny. When he entered East Prussia with the Red Army throughout the East Prussian Offensive, he sharply criticized the atrocities against the German civilian population and was arrested in 1945 and sentenced to a ten-year term in the Gulag for fostering &quot;bourgeois humanism&quot; and for &quot;compassion towards the enemy&quot;. In the sharashka Marfino he met Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Kopelev became a prototype for Rubin from &quot;The First Circle&quot;.

He was released in 1954 and in 1956 was rehabilitated. Still an optimist and believer in the ideals of communism, during the Khrushchev Thaw he restored his Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) membership. From 1957 to 1969 he taught in the Moscow Institute of Polygraphy and the Institute of History of Arts. It was Kopelev who approached Aleksandr Tvardovsky, editor of the top Soviet literary journal, the &quot;Novy Mir&quot; (New World) to urge publication of Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;.

From 1968 onward Kopelev actively participated in the human rights and dissident movement. In 1968 he was fired from his job and expelled from the CPSU and the Writers&#x27; Union for signing protest letters against the persecution of dissidents, publicly supporting Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel and actively denouncing the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He also protested Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s expulsion from the Writers&#x27; Union and wrote in defense of dissenting General Pyotr Grigorenko, imprisoned at a psikhushka.

Kopelev&#x27;s books were distributed via samizdat (underground publishing), smuggled out of Russia and published in the West.

For his political activism and contacts with the West, he was deprived of the right to teach or be published in 1977.

==Germany==

As a scientist, Kopelev led a research project on the history of Russian-German cultural links at the University of Wuppertal. In 1980, while he was on a study trip to West Germany, his Soviet citizenship was revoked. After 1981 Kopelev was a professor at the University of Wuppertal.

Kopelev was an honorary PhD at the University of Cologne and a winner of many international awards. In 1990 Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev restored his Soviet citizenship.

==Personal life==
Kopelev was married for many years to Raisa Orlova, a Soviet specialist in American literature, who emigrated with him to Germany. Her memoirs were published in the United States in 1984.

==Death==
Lev Kopelev died in Cologne, Germany on 18 June 1997 at the age of 85, and was buried in the New Donskoy Cemetery in Moscow.

<doc id="500597" wikidata="Q1174676" url="?curid=500597" title="David Hare (playwright)">
<text>Sir David Rippon Hare (born 5 June 1947) is an English playwright, screenwriter and theatre director. Best known for his stage work, Hare has also enjoyed great success with films, receiving two Academy Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay for writing &quot;The Hours&quot; in 2002, based on the novel by Michael Cunningham, and &quot;The Reader&quot; in 2008, based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink.

In the West End, he had his greatest success with the plays&quot; Plenty&quot; (1978), which he adapted into a 1985 film starring Meryl Streep, &quot;Racing Demon&quot; (1990), &quot;Skylight&quot; (1997), and &quot;Amy&#x27;s View&quot; (1998). The four plays ran on Broadway in 1982–83, 1996, 1998 and 1999 respectively, earning Hare three Tony Award nominations for Best Play for the first three and two Laurence Olivier Awards for Best New Play. His other notable projects on stage include &quot;A Map of the World&quot;, &quot;Pravda&quot; (starring Anthony Hopkins at the Royal National Theatre in London), &quot;Murmuring Judges&quot;, &quot;The Absence of War&quot;, &quot;The Vertical Hour&quot;, and his latest play &quot;Straight Line Crazy&quot; starring Ralph Fiennes. 

For the big and small screens, along with the Oscar-winning screenplays for the Stephen Daldry drama films &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Reader&quot; (2008), he both wrote and directed the BBC&#x27;s much acclaimed &quot;Worricker Trilogy&quot; of films — &quot;Page Eight&quot; (2011), &quot;Turks &amp; Caicos&quot; (2014), and &quot;Salting the Battlefield&quot; (2014) — as well as scripting television series for the BBC, &quot;Collateral&quot; (2018) and &quot;Roadkill&quot; (2020).

In addition to his two Academy Award nominations, Hare has received three Golden Globe Award nominations, three Tony Award nominations and has won a BAFTA Award, a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and two Laurence Olivier Awards. He has also been awarded several critics&#x27; awards, such as the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, and he received the Golden Bear in 1985.

Hare has been associate director of the National Theatre since 1984.

==Early life and education ==
David Rippon Hare was born on 5 June 1947 in St Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, Sussex, and was raised – first in a flat, then in a semi-detached house – in Bexhill-on-Sea, the son of Agnes Cockburn (née Gilmour) and Clifford Theodore Rippon Hare, a passenger ship&#x27;s purser in the Merchant Navy. His father&#x27;s elder brother was the cricketer Steriker Hare. The Hare family claims descent from the Earls of Bristol. 

Hare was educated at Lancing College, an independent school in Sussex, and at Jesus College, Cambridge (MA (Cantab.), English Literature). While at Cambridge, he was the hiring manager on the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club Committee in 1968.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
Hare worked with the Portable Theatre Company from 1968 to 1971. His first play, &quot;Slag&quot;, was produced in 1970, the same year in which he married his first wife, Margaret Matheson; the couple had three children and divorced in 1980. He was Resident Dramatist at the Royal Court Theatre, London, from 1970 to 1971, and in 1973 became resident dramatist at the Nottingham Playhouse. He co-founded the Joint Stock Theatre Company with David Aukin and Max Stafford-Clark in 1975. Hare&#x27;s play &quot;Plenty&quot; was produced at the National Theatre in 1978. 
Aside from films, he has also written teleplays such as, for the BBC, &quot;Licking Hitler&quot; (1978), and, for Thames Television, &quot;&quot; (1983).

=== 1980s ===
Hare founded a film company called Greenpoint Films in 1982, and among screenplays he has written are &quot;Plenty&quot;, &quot;Wetherby&quot;, &quot;Strapless&quot;, and &quot;Paris by Night&quot;. In 1983, his play &quot;A Map of the World&quot; was produced at the Royal National Theatre. The production starred Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, and Ronald Hines. The play is set at the Unesco conference on poverty held in Bombay in 1978. It transferred to The Public Theatre in 1985, starring Alfre Woodard, Elizabeth McGovern, and Zeljko Ivanek. In a mixed review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Frank Rich wrote: &quot;The play is in part about conflicting points of view – about how reactionaries and leftists look at geopolitics, how journalists and novelists look at events and how the West and the Third World look at each other.&quot;

In 1985, Hare wrote &quot;Pravda&quot; with Howard Brenton, its title referring to the Russian Communist party newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;. The play, a satire on the mid-1980s newspaper industry, in particular the Australian media and press baron Rupert Murdoch, stars Anthony Hopkins in a role that earned him the Laurence Olivier Award. Hare became the associate director of the National Theatre in 1984, and has since seen many of his plays produced, including his trilogy about major British institutions: &quot;Racing Demon&quot;, &quot;Murmuring Judges&quot;, and &quot;The Absence of War&quot;. He has also directed many other plays aside from his own works, notable examples being &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; by Snoo Wilson, &quot;Weapons of Happiness&quot; by Howard Brenton, and &quot;King Lear&quot; by William Shakespeare for the National Theatre. Hare is also the author of a collection of lectures on the arts and politics called &quot;Obedience, Struggle, and Revolt&quot; (2005).

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Hare wrote &quot;Racing Demon&quot;; part of a trio of plays about British institutions, it focuses on the Church of England, and tackles issues such as gay ordination, and the role of evangelism in inner-city communities. The play debuted at the National Theatre and received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. The play transferred to the Broadway stage at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1995. The production starred Paul Giamatti, Denis O&#x27;Hare, and Kathleen Chalfant. The play was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play.

In 1995, Hare&#x27;s translation of &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; by Bertolt Brecht was produced in London. In 1996, Hare wrote &quot;Skylight&quot;, a play about a woman who receives an unexpected visit from her former lover whose wife has recently died. Michael Gambon and Lia Williams starred in the original production, which received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. The following year, the production transferred to the Broadway stage, where it was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play.

In 1998, Hare wrote &quot;Amy&#x27;s View&quot;, a play that deals with an emotional relationship between a mother and her daughter. The original production at the Royal National Theatre starred Judi Dench, Samantha Bond, and Ronald Pickup. Dench starred in the Broadway transfer, earning the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play in 1999.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, Hare wrote &quot;My Zinc Bed&quot;, which premiered at the Royal Court Theatre starring Tom Wilkinson, Julia Ormond, and Steven Mackintosh. The play was adapted into a television film of the same name in 2008. The play received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play nomination, Hare&#x27;s eighth Olivier Award nomination. The following year Hare wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002) adapted from the Michael Cunningham book of the same name. The film starred an ensemble cast that included Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman as women from three different time periods struggling against adversity. Hare received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination as well as BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award nominations.

In 2008, he adapted Bernhard Schlink&#x27;s 1995 novel into Stephen Daldry&#x27;s film &quot;The Reader&quot; starring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes. The film focuses on a romance in the 1950s between a teenaged boy and an older woman who is later discovered to have been a Nazi guard and is on trial for committing war crimes during the Holocaust. The film was well reviewed and earned Hare his second Academy Award nomination. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globe Award nominations.

=== 2010s ===
Hare&#x27;s 2011 play &quot;South Downs&quot;, based on his based on his own experiences of being schooled at Lancing College, was well received at the Chichester Festival, and was adapted as a &quot;Saturday Drama&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

In December 2011, it was announced that his monologue &quot;Wall&quot; about the Israeli West Bank barrier was being adapted by Cam Christiansen as a live-action/animated documentary by the National Film Board of Canada; originally slated for completed in 2014, &quot;Wall&quot; premiered at the Calgary International Film Festival in 2017. In November 2012, The New School for Drama selected Hare as temporary Artist-in-residence, during which he interacted with student playwrights about his experience in varying mediums. His career is examined in the Reputations strand on &quot;TheatreVoice&quot;. He is particularly well known for incisive commentary on the problems of public institutions. Raymond Williams once said, sardonically, that the public services are largely managed by the nation&#x27;s &quot;upper servants&quot;. Hare addresses this group, providing an analysis of the workings of the institutions: he is, he has said, interested in the struggle to make procedures work better – right now – not in waiting until some revolution, somehow, sometime, comes about to raze the current system altogether, to replace it with perfection.

In 2016, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; reported that the Jonathan Franzen novel &quot;Purity&quot; was in the process of being adapted into a 20-hour limited series by Todd Field who would share writing duties with Franzen and Hare. It would star Daniel Craig as Andreas Wolf and be executive produced by Field, Franzen, Craig, Hare &amp; Scott Rudin.

However, in a February 2018 interview with &quot;The Times&quot; London, Hare said that, given the budget for Field&#x27;s adaptation (170 million), he doubted it would ever be made, but added &quot;It was one of the richest and most interesting six weeks of my life, sitting in a room with Todd Field, Jonathan Franzen and Daniel Craig bashing out the story. They&#x27;re extremely interesting people.&quot;

In 2016, Hare wrote the screenplay for &quot;Denial&quot; based on Deborah Lipstadt&#x27;s &quot;History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier&quot;. The film starred Tom Wilkinson, Rachel Weisz, and Timothy Spall. The film dramatises the &quot;Irving v Penguin Books Ltd&quot; case, in which Lipstadt, a Holocaust scholar, was sued by Holocaust denier David Irving for libel. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. It later received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film nomination.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, Hare contracted COVID-19, an experience reflected in his monologue &quot;Beat the Devil&quot;, with Ralph Fiennes in the starring role.

In 2022, Hare wrote, &quot;Straight Line Crazy&quot;. The play is set in the 1920s through the 1960s in New York City and centres on the life of Robert Moses, portrayed by Fiennes. Fiennes stars as Moses, once a powerful man in New York and the &quot;master builder&quot; of infrastructure from new parks, bridges and expressways. During his working life, he served on the New York State Council of Parks and was the New York Secretary of State. The play premiered at the Bridge Theatre in London in March 2022. The play transferred to the New York stage with Fiennes at The Shed in October 2022.

A new play titled &quot;Grace Pervades&quot; and starring Ralph Fiennes is set to premiere in summer 2025 at Theatre Royal, Bath. The play explores the lives of the thespians Henry Irving, Ellen Terry, Edith Craig and Edward Gordon Craig (Terry&#x27;s two children with Edward William Godwin).

== Archive ==
In 1993, Hare sold his archive to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The archive consists of typescript drafts, notes, rehearsal scripts, schedules, production notes, correspondence, theatre programs, resumes, photographs, and published texts associated with Hare&#x27;s plays, teleplays, screenplays, and essays, as well as foreign-language translations of Hare&#x27;s works; works by other authors; personal correspondence; minutes of meetings; and Hare&#x27;s English papers from Cambridge University.

== Personal life ==
Hare married the French fashion designer Nicole Farhi in 1992.

In 1993, Hare&#x27;s best friend Sarah Matheson was diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy and died from the disease in 1999. In January 2015, Hare broadcast the BBC Radio 4 appeal to raise money for the Multiple System Atrophy Trust, which was founded by Matheson.

<text>Mount McLoughlin is a dormant steep-sided stratovolcano, or composite volcano, in the Cascade Range of southern Oregon and within the United States Sky Lakes Wilderness. It is one of the volcanic peaks in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, within the High Cascades sector. A prominent landmark for the Rogue River Valley, the mountain is north of Mount Shasta, and south-southwest of Crater Lake. It was named around 1838 after John McLoughlin, a Chief Factor for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Mount McLouglin&#x27;s prominence has made it a landmark to Native American populations for thousands of years.

McLoughlin consists largely of basaltic andesite. It underwent three major eruptive periods before its last activity took place between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago. It is not currently monitored for activity or deformation. Diverse species of flora and fauna inhabit the area, which is subject to frequent snowfall and temperature variation between seasons. The Pacific Crest Trail skirts the eastern and northern sides and also accesses the only trail to the summit, the McLoughlin Trail 3716. The mountain can also be skied.

== Geography ==
The major landmark for the Rogue River Valley, Mount McLoughlin reaches an elevation of . The tallest volcano in between Mount Shasta — located to the south — and South Sister to the north, it lies in the Cascade Range, in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Oregon. Most of the volcano lies in Jackson County, though the eastern side of its base lies in Klamath County. It is the sixth tallest peak in Oregon, but despite its height, Mount McLoughlin only has a volume of .

The volcano includes the Wilámxa Tip and Máalsi Tip peaks, which occur on its flanks at elevations of
 and
, respectively. It can be seen from the Interstate 5 and U.S. Route 97 highways. From the southwest and southeast, it has a symmetrical appearance, but the northeastern flank of the volcano has been eroded and transformed into a hollow amphitheater.

=== Wilderness ===
McLoughlin lies within the Sky Lakes Wilderness area, part of the and the Fremont–Winema National Forests. The Sky Lakes Wilderness covers an area of , with a width of and a length of . Designated by the United States Congress in 1984, it stretches from Crater Lake National Park to Oregon Route 140 at the south and ranges in elevation from in the Middle Fork canyon of the Rogue River to the peak of McLoughlin. The wilderness area encompasses more than 200 bodies of water including ponds and lakes, in addition to forests and mountain ridges.

=== Physical geography ===

The local area has warm, dry summers during the daytime with cool nights, and snowy winters that impede access to the Sky Lakes Wilderness through July. Moisture is limited between June and October barring occasional thunderstorms, which accounts for a very short growing season between ice thawing and drought. On average, precipitation does not exceed at medium elevations, reaching at greater heights, most of which consists of snowfall.

Around the base of the mountain, there are a number of lakes, including the Lake of the Woods and Fourmile Lake. The Upper Klamath Lake, the largest body of freshwater in the state, sits to the east of Mount McLoughlin. The Summit Lake is a small lake on the northern slope of the volcano between the Rogue River and the Klamath Basin. The Big Butte Creek, a tributary of the Rogue River, drains the northwestern part of McLoughlin, while the Little Butte Creek is fed by the southern flanks.

=== Climate ===
== Ecology ==
About 20 tree species can be found throughout Mount McLoughlin&#x27;s surroundings, including Pacific yew at low elevations, mountain hemlock, whitebark pine, and subalpine fir at higher elevations, and lodgepole pine and red fir throughout. Other plant species include shrubs, wildflowers, junipers, heather, columbine, kinnikinnick, huckleberry, chinquapins, grouse huckleberry, and bearberry.

Common fauna in the area include chipmunks, deer, elk, American black bears, coyotes, while yellow-bellied marmots, fishers, pikas, and American martens are less common. More than 150 bird species live in the Big Butte Creek watershed near McLoughlin. Eagles and hawks can be sighted in the vicinity, as can spotted owls. goshawks like to live beneath the tree canopy in the region. Amphibian species like Oregon spotted frogs and Cascades frogs live in certain parts of the watershed. Fish species include Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, Coho salmon, Pacific lamprey, and coastal cutthroat trout.

== Geology ==
Little was known about Mount McLoughlin&#x27;s geology until the 1970s. Much of what is known today comes from LeRoy Maynard of the center for Volcanology at the University of Oregon. His work established that the volcano was built over three eruptive phases, each with their own eruption types. James Smith from the United States Geological Survey expanded on Maynard&#x27;s findings, producing a map of the McLoughlin region.

McLoughlin is part of the High Cascades, which trend north–south. Formed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north–south faulting in the surrounding region. Like other Cascade volcanoes, Mount McLoughlin was fed by magma chambers produced by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the western edge of the North American tectonic plate. Within Oregon, plutons, or bodies of intrusive igneous rock that crystallize from magma cooling below the surface of the Earth, lay between northwest of the major High Cascade axis. At McLoughlin, mean displacement rates for the past 16 million years have been each year.

The volcano shows magnetic high points to the east of its main cone, suggesting that it has normal magnetic polarization that corresponds to an age of less than 700,000 years. Other evidence that the volcano is geologically young include its symmetrical shape on the western and southern sides, its well-preserved lava flow deposits, and the absence of soil formation on many of its flow deposits.

McLoughlin is a stratovolcano, made up of basaltic andesite on top of underlying basaltic andesitic shield volcanoes, though it is also described as a basaltic-andesite lava cone. Much of its central volcanic cone formed within the last 200,000 years, including lava flows on the sides of the mountain that are between 30,000 and 20,000 years old. The volcano has a volume of , and its lava is predominantly basaltic andesite with silicon dioxide content between 53 and 57 percent, though it also has andesite.

During the last ice age, a large ice cap buried most of the High Cascades, reaching thicknesses in the thousands of feet. Pleistocene glaciers carved out McLoughlin&#x27;s major volcanic cone, excavating two solidified lava tubes that reached the summit crater. From 25,000 to 12,000 years ago, glaciers on the northern slopes of the volcano combined with an ice cap at the base of the volcano that was about thick. A cirque glacier occupied part of the depression until early in the 20th century. The volcano displays a lack of snow during the summer season.

=== Nearby features ===

Two nearby volcanoes closely resemble Mount McLoughlin in composition. Brown Mountain, a shield volcano with a volume of , lies to the southeast, while Pelican Butte, the most prominent shield volcano in the southern Cascades of Oregon, lies to the east.

Brown Mountain has been dated to between 60,000 and 12,000 years old. It produced basaltic andesite lava flows that have not been heavily eroded, but during Pleistocene glacial advance, ice streams on the volcano ate away at the cinder cone that formed Brown Mountain&#x27;s summit. This formed a glacial cirque with a bowl shape on the northeastern flank.

Pelican Butte reaches an elevation of , and it features gradual slopes. Adjacent to Klamath Lake, it has a greater volume than McLoughlin at , and it is made up of basaltic andesite. Like Brown Mountain, Pelican Butte has a cinder cone on the top of its summit, in addition to a glacial cirque and ravine that were excavated on its northeastern side. These eroded areas exhibit pyroclastic rock in a matrix with lava flows, suggesting that blocky and ʻaʻā lavas formed an outer shell around Pelican Butte&#x27;s fragmented interior. Glaciation has also lowered the overall volcano by tens of yards.

Other volcanoes can be found within the Sky Lakes Wilderness area, including lava flows and mud flows at Big Bunchgrass Butte and Imagination Peak, in addition to more recent eruptive activity at Goosenest Mountain in the northeastern sector.

== Eruptive history ==
Mount McLoughlin underwent at least three distinct eruptive phases. Early activity at Mount McLoughlin was explosive, and it yielded tephra and pyroclastic rock that built about a third of the overall volume. These eruptions also yielded lava flows, but they only occurred on the lower flanks. The northwestern flank has volcanic vents that produced lava flows responsible for inundating the Fourbit Creek valley from the base of McLoughlin, which extend up to the Big Butte Springs. Other lava flows from earlier eruptions reach at least from the base of the mountain, a number of which run along the Oregon Route 140 highway. One ʻaʻā stream that filled a river valley for in length moved from an elevation of to , though it was thin, with more than of its length being less than in width.

A second eruptive stage was characterized by large lava flows, which covered the inner pyroclastic core with basaltic andesite. These thin lava flows formed a shell around the loosely compacted pyroclastic interior. The third stage of development consisted of floods of blocky lava erupting from below the summit and more fluid lavas erupting from basal fissures, mostly confined to the south slope.
Wilámxa Tip and Máalsi Tip on McLoughlin&#x27;s west flank now mark the site of the two major blocky flow vents. There are two smaller vents as well. The entire third stage is thought to have happened after the last Pleistocene glaciers in the area had melted, due to a general lack of weathering and fresh appearance of the solidified lava. The freshest lava flows at Mount McLoughlin occur on the southern and western flanks of the mountain, and they are thought to be between 30,000 and 20,000 years old.

=== Future activity ===

Mount McLoughlin&#x27;s main volcanic cone has not erupted during the Holocene, with the last production of lava flows taking place between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago. The volcano is not currently monitored for activity or deformation. The closest seismic monitoring stations lie to the south near Mount Shasta and the Medicine Lake Volcano.

== Human history ==
McLouglin has served as a landmark to Native American populations for thousands of years. They utilized the area to hunt and gather berries. The Takelma people referred to it as &quot;Mal-sr&quot; or &quot;Alwilamchaldis&quot;, one of their mythical heroes, and they considered it the home of Tasuune, or the &quot;Acorn Woman&quot;, a being that helped their acorns grow every year. In the culture of the Shasta people, McLoughlin was known as &quot;Makayax&quot;; the Klamath people named the volcano &quot;Walum&quot; and &quot;Kesh yainatat&quot;, meaning the home of the &quot;dwarf old woman&quot; that controlled the west wind. McLoughlin was called &quot;Melaiksi&quot; by the Modoc people. The Little Butte Creek which drains from McLoughlin was called &quot;So-ytanak&quot;, translating as &quot;corner&quot; or &quot;rock house&quot;, by the Upper Takelma people.

First detected by an American explorer Peter Skene Ogden in 1827, McLoughlin has a complex name-place history. Ogden called the volcano &quot;Mt. Sastise&quot; after the Shasta Native Americans that helped him reach the Rogue Valley, but this name was later exchanged with Mount Shasta in northern California, then called &quot;Pit Mountain&quot;. To local residents, Mount McLoughlin&#x27;s English name was Mount Pitt, though it came to be referred to by other names including Mt. John Quincy Adams, Mt. Clear View, Snowy Butte, and Mt. Madison, also appearing in maps as Mount Pitt, Mount Simpson, and Mount Jackson. Though the volcano was also known as Mount McLoughlin during the 1800s, it was officially renamed in 1905 by the Oregon Legislative Assembly after Dr. John McLoughlin, a factor for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company noted for helping American settlers in the 1830s and 1840s. An important figure in the local fur trade, McLoughlin was also known as the &quot;Father of Oregon&quot;. The change from Pitt to McLoughlin was later confirmed by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1912.

The area around Mount McLoughlin was frequented by fur trappers and explorers, but they did not settle for long stays in the area. Settlers living near the surrounding Sky Lakes Wilderness trapped beavers and martens during the winter seasons, hunted, and grazed sheep in warmer months. Stuart Falls and Twin Ponds marked popular spots for picking huckleberries. Trails and fire lookouts were constructed for the Sky Lakes Wilderness area in the early 1900s, with the Pacific Crest Trail expanding into the region during the mid-1970s, superseding the pre-existing Oregon Skyline Trail.

Mount McLoughlin&#x27;s first known ascent took place in 1858, when Joseph Burpee, William Wilkinson, Dr. Greer, Henry Klippel, John S. Love, and Robert Haines, from the city of Jacksonville, reached the summit from the northeast. The event was reported in a letter published by the &quot;Jacksonville Democratic Times&quot; on May 28, 1897. In 1896, members of the Mazama mountaineering club including Lottie Reed, Henry Pittock, and Leslie Scott ascended the mountain.

As of 1926, Mount McLoughlin&#x27;s western flank acts as the municipal watershed for Medford, its melted snow feeding the Big Butte Springs near the city. The summer melting of snow forms a shape that is referred to locally as &quot;the angel wings&quot; or &quot;the diving eagle&quot;, which local fishers consider a sign of peak fishing opportunities in the mountain&#x27;s lakes.

== Recreation ==
Mount McLoughlin has a hiking trail to its summit. While non-technical, the trail gains about in elevation, typically requiring at least six hours from start to finish. The trail receives moderate to heavy use each year; the peak is easiest to reach from July through September, when the trailhead is accessible by vehicle and snow is minimal along the path. The Mt. McLoughlin Trailhead is on Forest Road 3650, north of Oregon Route 140. After about , the Mt. McLoughlin Trail joins the Pacific Crest Trail for half a mile, then passes through a forested area for about before reaching timberline. The last mile of the route travels over blocky lava and rubble, and the trail above the tree line is less clearly delineated. From the summit, Mount Shasta and Crater Lake can be seen.

During the winter, the climb requires snowshoes, crampons, and ice axes, and is far more challenging than the popular summertime route. The access road from Oregon Route 140 may also be closed due to snow, requiring a longer approach on snowshoes or cross country skis. The mountain can also be skied, which has become more popular in recent years.

<doc id="500609" wikidata="Q2984682" url="?curid=500609" title="Al-Faw peninsula">
<text>The Al-Faw peninsula (; also transliterated as &quot;Fao&quot; or &quot;Fawr&quot;) is a peninsula in the Persian Gulf, located in the extreme southeast of Iraq. The marshy peninsula is southeast of Iraq&#x27;s third largest city, Basra, and is part of a delta for the Shatt al-Arab (Arvand Rud) river, formed by the confluence of the major Euphrates and Tigris rivers. The al-Faw peninsula borders Iran to the northeast, with the cities of Abadan and Khorramshahr on the opposite side of the Shatt al-Arab, and Kuwait to the southwest, opposite from Bubiyan Island and Warbah Island, near the Iraqi city of Umm Qasr.

Al-Faw, the only significant town on the peninsula and its namesake, is a fishing town and port which during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s presidency featured the main naval base of the Iraqi Navy. The remainder of the al-Faw peninsula is otherwise lightly inhabited, with few civilian buildings or settlements and most of its few residents involved in the fishing, oil, or shipping industries. It is the site of a number of important oil installations, most notably Iraq&#x27;s two main oil tanker terminals: Khor al-Amaya and Mina al-Bakr, due to its chief importance as a strategic location controlling access to the Shatt al-Arab waterway and thus access to the port of Basra.

==Iran-Iraq War==

During the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, al-Faw was bitterly contested due to its strategic location at the head of the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway and was the site of many large-scale battles. On February 11, 1986, the Iranians capitalized on the weakness of the Iraqi defences located at the southernmost tip of the peninsula by launching a surprise attack against Iraqi troops defending al-Faw. The Iraqi units in charge of the defences consisted mostly of poorly trained Iraqi Popular Army conscripts that collapsed when they were suddenly attacked by Iranian Pasdaran (Revolutionary Guard) forces.

It marked the first time that the Iranians had successfully invaded and occupied Iraqi territory. The Iranians defeated several Iraqi Republican Guard counter-offensives and managed to hang on to their foothold.

The occupation of al-Faw placed Basra at risk of being attacked. The Iranians also used the peninsula as a launch pad for Silkworm missiles which were deployed against shipping and oil terminals in the Persian Gulf, and also against Kuwait, which supported Iraq throughout the war.

On April 17, 1988, the newly-restructured Iraqi Army began a major operation, &quot;Ramadan Mubarak,&quot; which was aimed to clear the Iranians out of the peninsula. The Iraqis concentrated well over 100,000 troops from the Republican Guard versus 15,000 second-rate Iranian Basij soldiers.

By using sarin nerve gas, artillery barrages and air bombardments, the Iraqis eventually expelled the Iranians from the peninsula within 35 hours, with much of their equipment captured intact. The event was marked as an official national holiday under the former regime of Saddam Hussein, celebrated as the Faw City Liberation Day.

==Anglo-American occupation==
The 1991 Gulf War was fought south and west of al-Faw, but the peninsula&#x27;s military installations were heavily bombed by Allied forces during the conflict. The Allied forces effectively closed down all of Iraq&#x27;s shipping activities and thus rendered its access to the Shatt al-Arab and the Persian Gulf useless.

The peninsula was one of the first targets of the Coalition forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with British, American and Polish troops involved. Forces from the Royal Marines, US Marines and the Polish GROM staged a successful midnight amphibious assault on the peninsula. All of them were attached to the British 3 Commando Brigade. Their goal was to secure the port of Umm Qasr to allow humanitarian goods to be shipped in, and to secure the key oil installations located in the area before they could be sabotaged by retreating Iraqi forces. The Mina al-Bakr oil terminal was seized by SEAL Teams 8 and 10; as well as US Navy EOD personnel. The Khor al-Amaya oil terminal was seized by GROM operators. The peninsula fell quickly with minimal Iraqi resistance, but unexpected fierce resistance in Umm Qasr required several days of fighting before the town had been secured.

The British, based at Camp Driftwood, provided the security and countersmuggling force on land, and the American forces providing maritime assistance. Camp Driftwood was handed to Iraqi control in March 2007 by troops from 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment.

<doc id="500616" wikidata="Q778395" url="?curid=500616" title="Bank Street (Ottawa)">
<text>Bank Street (French: &quot;Rue Bank&quot;) is the major commercial north–south street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It runs south from Wellington Street in downtown Ottawa, south through the neighbourhoods of Centretown, The Glebe, Old Ottawa South, Alta Vista, Hunt Club, and then through the villages of Blossom Park, Leitrim, South Gloucester, Greely, Metcalfe, Spring Hill, and Vernon before ending at the city limit at Belmeade Road, becoming Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry county highway 31.

Bank Street made up much of Highway 31 before it was downloaded in 1998 (all of it south of Heron Road). Currently it is also known as [[List of numbered roads in Ottawa|Ottawa Road #31]].

==Features==

Between Wellington Street and Gladstone Avenue in downtown, Bank Street is a shopping and business development district officially known as the &quot;Bank Street Promenade&quot; and the street is lined with common signage affixed to streetlights and street-level advertising billboards showing this distinction.

The area between Somerset Street West and Gladstone Avenue (within the Bank Street Promenade) is considered the centre of Ottawa&#x27;s burgeoning gay village, characterized by a small concentration of businesses targeted to Ottawa&#x27;s LGBT community. In 2011, the city officially unveiled signs identifying the neighbourhood as Ottawa&#x27;s gay village, at the intersections of Somerset, James and Nepean Streets with Bank Street.

Travelling south, there exists a shopping district in The Glebe running exclusively along Bank Street from approximately the Queensway to Holmwood Avenue. Bank Street is home to Lansdowne Park where the Ottawa 67&#x27;s and Ottawa RedBlacks play. Even further south, after the road passes over the Rideau Canal on the Bank Street Bridge, Bank Street is home to the Billings Bridge Plaza and eventually, the South Keys Shopping Centre.

Bank Street north of Billings Bridge is an historic urban arterial road, often with many more pedestrians than vehicular traffic and significant parking issues, hence the flow is generally quite slow. South of Billings Bridge to Leitrim Road, the street turns into a more modern four-lane (or five-lane) urban arterial, which flows much better despite the 50 km/h (30 mph) speed limit on the northern half and 60 km/h (about 40 mph) from South Keys southward. South of Leitrim it is a rural two-lane highway with an 80 km/h speed limit until the community of Vernon. Recently, just south of Leitrim Road, Bank Street gives access to a developing neighborhood called Findlay Creek that will become quite significant in the long term, and it will also provide access (after secondary roads are extended) to the community of Riverside South.

Bank Street also serves in some contexts as an unofficial division between &quot;eastern&quot; and &quot;western&quot; Ottawa. For example, prior to the takeover of Maclean-Hunter by Rogers Cable in 1994, the street marked the division between those cable companies&#x27; service areas in Ottawa: cable subscribers west of Bank Street were served by Maclean-Hunter, while cable subscribers east of Bank Street were served by Rogers.

==History==

===Name of the street===
Contrary to popular belief, the street is not named after the Bank of Canada headquarters at the corner of Bank Street and Wellington Street. The street name dates back to the 19th century, whereas the bank was founded in 1934. It&#x27;s believed that the road was named this because it originally went from the &quot;bank&quot; of the Ottawa River at its northern end to that of the Rideau River to the south. However, the road was originally called Esther Street in honour of Colonel By&#x27;s wife. Bank Street officially ends at Wellington Street and the portion of the street running closest to the actual riverbank is federal Crown land for the Parliamentary Precinct of the Parliament of Canada. South of the Rideau River the road was previously named &quot;Prescott Road&quot;.

===As a Provincial Highway===

Highway 31 was formed in 1927, and started at the junction of Highway 2 in Morrisburg, Ontario. It travelled north through the town of Winchester, and eventually into Ottawa. The road was paved in stages, but was fully paved by 1936. The road&#x27;s designation of Highway 31 was extended from the Dundas-Stormont-Glengary/Russell-Prescott county line into Ottawa later that same year. While maintaining its alignment along Bank Street for its entire history, the road was re-aligned along Canal Drive (now today&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Driveway). From here, it became less clear where the northern terminus of the road was located, as Ottawa posted Highway 31 as a scenic route within its limits along Heron Road and Bronson Avenue (concurrent with Highway 16) before terminating in downtown, while the Ministry of Transportation noted no changes in road length (78 km / 48.8 mi). This is presumed to be a connecting link between Highway 31 and The Queensway (Highway 417), but these scenic routes/connecting links were all decommissioned by 1960. The road was also re-aligned along the Winchester Bypass, when it was completed and opened in 1974, but no other changes were made to the road since then, until being fully decommissioned as a provincial highway, in 1998.

===Bank Street rehabilitation===
Portions of Bank Street have undergone major reconstruction each year since 2006. The City of Ottawa held public consultations for a major redevelopment of Bank Street between Wellington Street and the Rideau Canal.

<doc id="500622" wikidata="Q1331243" url="?curid=500622" title="Mystic Pizza">
<text>Mystic Pizza is a 1988 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Donald Petrie in his feature directorial debut, and starring Annabeth Gish, Julia Roberts and Lili Taylor. It follows the coming-of-age of three young Portuguese-American friends who work at a pizza parlor in a seaside Connecticut town. The film received positive reviews, with Roger Ebert declaring at the time, &quot;I have a feeling that &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; may someday become known for the movie stars it showcased back before they became stars. All of the young actors in this movie have genuine gifts.&quot; It marked Matt Damon&#x27;s film debut.

==Plot==
Sisters Kat and Daisy Araújo, and their friend Josephina &quot;JoJo&quot; Barboza, are young Portuguese-American women working as waitresses at Mystic Pizza, a pizza parlor owned by Leona and her husband Vic in the fishing town of Mystic, Connecticut.

JoJo is engaged to Bill but faints at their wedding because she gets cold feet. She wants to continue having sex with Bill until she is ready to be married. Bill breaks up with her because she will not commit.

Kat and Daisy are opposites. Kat, the younger sister, is an aspiring astronomer. She has been accepted to Yale University on a partial scholarship and, in addition to waitressing at Mystic Pizza and babysitting, is working at the Mystic Seaport Whaling Museum‘s planetarium. In contrast, glamorous Daisy&#x27;s goal is to have as much fun as possible.

Daisy meets Charles, a rich young man, at a bar. The two begin a relationship, much to her mother&#x27;s dismay. At a family dinner, Charles&#x27;s relatives make insensitive comments about Daisy&#x27;s Portuguese ethnicity, and Charles overreacts. Daisy breaks up with him, accusing him of using her to rebel against his parents.

Kat becomes infatuated with Tim, an architect and Yale graduate who has hired her to babysit his six-year-old daughter Phoebe while his wife works in England. A relationship develops between them, and they sleep together.

Tensions rise between the two sisters: Kat criticizes Daisy for being promiscuous, which Daisy resents, since Kat is having an affair with a married man. However, when Tim’s wife Nicki returns, Tim rejects Kat. Daisy consoles her sister, and they reconcile.

A television food critic known as &quot;The Fireside Gourmet&quot; unexpectedly visits Mystic Pizza. He takes a few bites of one pizza slice, jots notes, pays, and leaves. His approval can do wonders for a restaurant, but they are not optimistic.

A few days later, Tim brings Phoebe to Mystic Pizza because she wants to say goodbye to Kat, as her family is leaving town. Tim gives Kat a check to help cover her tuition expenses, but she tears it up just as Fireside Gourmet’s latest show airs and he gives the restaurant his highest rating.

JoJo marries Bill, Kat accepts a loan from Leona, and Daisy and Charlie reconcile at the wedding. The film ends with the three women overlooking the water from the restaurant&#x27;s balcony, reminiscing about their time together and wondering about the future.

==Cast==
==Production and filming locations==
The title of the film was inspired by a pizza shop in Mystic, Connecticut. Screenwriter Amy Holden Jones was summering in the area and chose Mystic Pizza as the focus of her story about the lives of three young waitresses.

Jones was set to direct but was replaced by Petrie, who made his feature film directorial debut. The film was also Alfred Uhry&#x27;s screenwriting debut.

The filming began October 12, 1987, and was due to last six weeks. The film&#x27;s plot is set in Mystic, but most of the filming locations were in neighboring towns. The building used for the pizza restaurant was a converted home in Stonington Borough at 70 Water St. After the film&#x27;s release, the real-life Mystic Pizza building in downtown Mystic was renovated to resemble the film set. The Windsor family home, the wedding reception restaurant, the Peg Leg Pub pool hall, and the fishing docks were also filmed in Stonington Borough. The hitchhiking incident takes place on North Main Street in Stonington Town. The Araújo home is in Pawcatuck, Connecticut; the lobster business and the wedding church are in Noank, Connecticut. Tim Travers&#x27; home and the Windsors&#x27; country club are in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. The most notable scenes that take place in Mystic were filmed at the Mystic Seaport planetarium and at the Mystic River Bascule Bridge.

==Release==
Goldwyn spent a company-record $6.5 million on prints, advertising, and other marketing activities, including tie-ins with Domino&#x27;s Pizza and others. The film had 100 pre-opening screenings and premiered in Mystic, Connecticut on October 18, 1988. It was released on October 21, 1988.

==Reception==
Upon release, the film received mostly mixed reviews, which praised the performances by the three lead actresses. It received &quot;two thumbs up&quot; from popular film critics Siskel and Ebert, giving particular praise to the three female leads, including Gish, whom Ebert likened to a &quot;young Katharine Hepburn&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a deftly told coming-of-age story about three young femmes as they explore their different destinies, mostly through romance, it&#x27;s genuine and moving, with enough edge to impress contemporary audiences.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 78% based on reviews from 27 critics. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; is like its namesake food: it&#x27;s cheesy, topped with romance, and rises to the occasion.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 60% based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

==Home media==
On January 13, 2009, &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; and &quot;Say Anything...&quot; were released as a double feature on DVD. On April 5, 2011, &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; was released on Blu-ray.

==Stage musical adaptation==

On January 22, 2019, it was announced that &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; would be adapted into a stage musical. Melissa Etheridge would write the score, while Gordon Greenberg would direct and co-write the book with Sas Goldberg. This came years after a fictional Broadway musical adaptation of the film had served as a plot point in the early part of season 2 of the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; in 2007.

The world premiere of the musical version of &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; was produced by Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine from September 1, 2021, through October 2, 2021. The production, which featured songs by Melissa Etheridge and other pop songs of the 1980s, starred Krystina Alabado as Daisy, Gianna Yanelli as Jojo, and Kyra Kennedy as Kat. The production was directed by Casey Hushion and featured a book by Sandy Rustin, choreography by Liz Ramos, and musical supervision by Carmel Dean, with Kristin Stowell as music director. Executive producers were Michael Barra and Allison Bressi of Lively McCabe Entertainment.

<doc id="500633" wikidata="Q496364" url="?curid=500633" title="Great Bernera">
<text>Great Bernera (; ), often known just as Bernera (), is an island and community in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. With an area of just over , it is the thirty-fourth largest Scottish island.

Great Bernera lies in Loch Roag on the north-west coast of Lewis and is linked to it by a road bridge. Built in 1953, the bridge was the first pre-stressed concrete bridge in Europe. The main settlement on the island is Breaclete (Gaelic: &quot;Breacleit&quot;).

The island, under the name of &quot;Borva&quot;, was the setting for &quot;A Princess of Thule&quot; (1873) by the Scottish novelist William Black. The novel is notable for its descriptions of the local scenery.

==History==
The island&#x27;s name is Norse in origin and is derived in honour of Bjarnar, father of the Norse Chieftain of Lewis Ketil Bjarnarson (or the Flatneif). The vast majority of placenames in the district are similarly Norse, implying extensive Viking settlement.

The most common name on Great Bernera is MacDonald (MacDhòmhnaill or Dòmhnallach), 
and these are said to be descended from a watchman of the Macaulays of Uig, who gave
him the island in return for his services.

After 1962 the island was owned by Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, a former Queen&#x27;s Herald, who was recognised as Laird of Bernera. He eventually inherited the title Prince of Coronata and died in 2012. His home Bernera Lodge was at Kirkibost. Bernera was inherited by his grandson, Cyran. The island&#x27;s residents are seeking to buy the land from him. The Mirrlees family commissioned a flag recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms.

==Kirkibost / Circeabost==

In the southeast of the island is the first planned crofting township in the Outer Hebrides. It was created in 1805 by the regular allotting of individual crofts by the Earl of Seaforth&#x27;s land surveyor, James Chapman. The tenants of this planned village were all evicted in 1823 and the publication of the first edition of the Ordnance Survey rather poignantly showed the deserted village and the original parallel croft boundaries. The village was resettled in 1878 and the original boundaries are still in use today.

==Calanais VIII==
Callanish VIII is a unique standing stone arrangement near the bridge between Lewis and Bernera, set out in a semicircle. It is known locally as &quot;Tursachan&quot;, which means merely &quot;Standing Stones&quot;. The ruins of Dun Barraglom broch are nearby.

==Bostadh==

Bernera is also known for its Iron Age (or possibly Pictish) settlement at Bostadh (or Bosta), discovered in 1992 and now covered by sand so that it is preserved. A replica Iron Age house matching those now buried is sited nearby.

Bostadh Beach is the location of a Time and Tide Bell, one of a series of installations by Marcus Vergette.

== Teampall Chirceaboist ==
Teampall Chirceaboist (St Macel in Kirkibos) is the ruin of church, that is a scheduled monument. However, there is some debate about its actual location, local belief is that the scheduled monument is actually a more recent church, built around 1820, and the real Teampall Chirceaboist is located further up a hill.

==Bernera Riot==
The island was the location of the Bernera Riot of 1874, when crofters resisted the Highland clearances. This was a peasant revolt and subsequent legal case which resulted in a victory for oppressed small-tenants against the heavy-handed evictions and treatment by Donald Munro, the factor of Sir James Matheson. The islanders refused to agree to remove their stock in favour of expanding sporting estates, and were in turn threatened with a military visit. This did not occur, but even more eviction notices were handed out, and the visitors were pelted with clods of earth. The legal case was the first recorded victory for small-tenants at will and the evidence that was heard at the eleven-hour trial paved the way for land reform in Scotland.
==Geography and geology==

The island is roughly long by wide, the length being oriented from northwest to southeast. The coast is much indented and there are also numerous fresh water bodies such as Loch Barabhat, Loch Breacleit and Loch Niocsabhat. The highest point is the eminence of Sealabhal Bhiorach south of Bostadh and north of Tobson that reaches . There are deposits of muscovite and tremolite asbestos. An example of a rock of tremolite on muscovite from Great Bernera is shown in the photograph to the right.

The western side of the island is included in the South Lewis, Harris and North Uist National Scenic Area.

===Surrounding islands===
There are many islands in Loch Roag. To the west, from north to south are Pabaigh Mòr, Vacsay (&quot;Bhacsaigh&quot;), Fuaigh Mòr (&quot;Vuia Mòr&quot;), and Fuaigh Beag (&quot;Vuia Beg&quot;). To the north, the island of Bearnaraigh Beag (Little Bernera), and a number of islets. To the east, there are not so many islands, but there is Eilean Chearstaidh (Eilean Kerstay) to the southeast.

==Flora and fauna==
Sea life is especially rich where there is tidal run between the &quot;Caolas Bhalasaigh&quot; (English: &quot;Valasay Straits/Kyles&quot;) and the inner sea-loch of &quot;Tòb Bhalasaigh&quot;. There are numerous molluscs, sponges, brittlestars, and sea stars, the latter growing noticeably larger in size than normal. Cup coral, snakelocks anemone and dead man&#x27;s fingers coral, may also be found here. Common fish include shanny and butterfish and Atlantic and common seals are regular off-shore visitors.

Great Bernera hosts numerous seabird species, including gulls, waders and ducks such as goldeneye. More unusually, a jack snipe was observed on the island in 2007.

==Economy and infrastructure==

Great Bernera&#x27;s population is mainly dependent on lobster fishing, crofting, tourism and arts &amp; crafts. Fertile machair pasture permits sheep and cattle grazing. A processing plant was built at Kirkibost in 1972 which was later closed and redeveloped as a state-of-the-art music recording studio. In 2022, a new pontoon was built close to Kirkibost Pier and further developments such as camper van hook up points, laundrette and shower are opening in 2023. There are still a few weavers but this is no longer one of the main industries. Breacleit is home to a small museum, church, community centre with gym, sports halls, café and shop, self service fuel pump, electric vehicle charge points, fire station, community polytunnels and doctor&#x27;s surgery.

Communications were much improved during the 20th century. The first telephone was installed on Lewis in 1897 and outlying villages were slowly connected. Great Bernera was the last exchange to link to Lewis with a single wire circuit and an earth return. Nowadays Bernera has access to fast fibre broadband, which has brought new employment opportunities. The bridge to the island from Lewis was built in 1953 and was one of the first constructed using pre-stressed concrete post-tensioned techniques in Europe. It was constructed after the islanders threatened to dynamite the hillside to create a causeway of their own making. The bridge is sometimes referred to as The Bridge over the Atlantic, though this designation is also used for other bridges in Scotland and Faroes. 
In 2020, during a structural survey serious faults were identified and in 2021 work began to build a single span Delta bridge. This bridge opened with celebrations on the 15th December 2021.

In 2012 the island residents began a feasibility study to bring the island into community ownership, a process that has been successfully completed by the islanders of Gigha and Eigg. At the time of the 2011 census there were 252 people usually resident on the island, an increase of 8% on the figure of 233 for 2001.

<text>A maritime flag, also called a naval flag, is a flag designated for use on ships, boats, and other watercraft. Naval flags are considered important at sea and the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. The flag flown is related to the country of registration: so much so that the word &quot;flag&quot; is often used symbolically as a metonym for &quot;country of registration&quot;.

==Types of flag==

===Ensigns===

The ensign is the national identification of a ship and hoisted up in a national flag world-wide. They are required to be worn when entering and leaving harbour, when sailing through foreign waters, and when the ship is signalled to do so by a warship.

Ensigns are part of seafaring traditions of private and naval forces and have their origins in the era of sailing vessels. Flag dipping is done with the ensign. Ships usually wear their ensigns between the morning colours ceremony and sunset when moored or at anchor. Warships wear it at all times when underway, and when engaged in battle, wear the &quot;battle ensign&quot; or multiple ensigns.

Tradition dictated that if a ship lowered its ensign it was deemed to have surrendered. Masts were targets of gunfire, and the second and subsequent ensigns were worn in order to keep the ensign flying even after a mast hit.

===Jacks===
Jacks are flown on the bow and placed upon a jackstaff, and used when the vessel is in a port or dressed on special occasions, and not while being underway. The origin of the jack was on warships only. However, it became an additional flag for certain other vessels and is sometimes identical with the &quot;ensign&quot; on merchant ships, depending on the ships origin.

Jacks in the Royal Navy must be run up when the first line is ashore when coming alongside.

===Distinctive marks===

On 16 January 1899, commissioned ships of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey were authorized to wear their own flag to distinguish them from ships of the United States Navy, with which they shared a common ensign. Although they continued to wear the same ensign as U.S. Navy ships, ships of the Survey flew the Coast and Geodetic Survey flag as a &quot;distinctive mark&quot; until the newly created National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) took over control of the Survey″s ships in 1970. Since then, commissioned ships of the NOAA fleet, which also wear the same national ensign as U.S. Navy ships, have worn the flag of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as a distinctive mark.

Similarly, all ships of the United States Lighthouse Service wore the U.S. Lighthouse Service flag until the service merged into the United States Coast Guard on 1 July 1939, and ships of the United States Bureau of Fisheries wore the Bureau of Fisheries flag until the bureau was merged into the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on 30 June 1940. the Fish and Wildlife service subsequently has flown its flag as a distinctive mark on its ships.

===Rank flags===

The rank flag or distinguishing flag is the flag worn by a superior officer on their flagship or headquarters (hence the term &quot;flag&quot;ship). The origins of this are from the era before radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony, when orders were given by flag signals. The flag denotes the ship which must be watched for signals designating orders. Such flags are also worn when leaders of the government (presidents, prime ministers or defense secretaries) are aboard Navy ships, showing the ship to hold the headquarters of highest level of authority for the Armed Forces. Today, with the progress in communications, this flag indicates the obligation of the other Naval vessels to pay the relevant honours (Manning the rails, firing cannon salute, attention, etc.) according to nautical etiquette. In a group of naval ships all commanded by superior officers, only the commander of the group or the officer of the highest rank can wear his flag.

*In the Royal Navy, admirals fly rectangular rank flags: an Admiral of the Fleet flies a Union Flag, while an admiral flies the St George&#x27;s Cross. The flags of vice-admirals and rear-admirals have two and one additional red balls respectively. Commodores fly a Broad Pennant which is a short swallow-tailed pennant based on the St George&#x27;s Cross, with a red ball at the canton (upper quarter next to the staff).
*In the United States Navy and the navies of some other countries, admirals fly rectangular flags with stars according to rank. Line officer flags are blue with white stars, while staff officer flags are white with blue stars.
*In the United States Coast Guard, the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps, admirals fly rectangular flags with stars according to rank. 
*In the Hellenic Navy (Greek Navy) Admirals fly blue square flags bearing a white cross (similar to the Hellenic Navy Jack) with four six-point stars (one in each of the squares formed by the cross); Vice-Admirals fly the same flag but with three stars; Rear Admirals two stars; and Commodores one star. Captains, when commanding a flotilla or squadron, fly a burgee (square swallow-tailed flag) with the colours of Hellenic Navy Jack. When a rank flag is flown the commissioning pennant is displaced downward.

===Pennants===

The &quot;pennant&quot;, historically called a pennon, is a long narrow flag, conveying different meanings depending on its design and use. Examples:

* A &quot;commissioning pennant&quot;, or &quot;masthead&quot;, which a warship flies from its masthead and indicates the commission of the captain of the ship (and thus of the ship itself). In the Royal Navy, the commissioning pennant is a small St George&#x27;s Cross with a long tapering plain white fly. In the United States Navy, it is red above white, with seven white stars in the blue hoist. In the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fleet, it has 13 (on the largest ships) or seven (on other vessels) red triangles on a white background at the hoist with a long tapering blue fly. The commissioning pennant may be displaced by various &quot;rank flags&quot;, namely the flags or pennants of admirals or commodores, and the personal flags of heads of state and members of royal families. In former centuries, masthead pennants were of a length similar to that of the ships that wore them, but nowadays very long pennants tend only to be seen when a ship is paying off.
* A church pennant, as used by the Royal Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy and Commonwealth Navies, is a broad pennant flown on ships and at establishments (bases) during religious services, and has the George Cross and Dutch flag incorporated; chosen after the English Dutch Wars where both sides stopped for Church on a Sunday. A similar church pennant is flown by U.S. Navy ships during services.
*A &quot;senior officer present afloat pennant&quot; using the NATO signal flag for &quot;starboard&quot; is green on the hoist and fly with a white field between.
*A &quot;gin pennant&quot; means that the wardroom is inviting officers from ships in company to drinks. The origins of the gin pennant are uncertain, but it seems to have been used since the 1940s and probably earlier. Originally it was a small green triangular pennant measuring approximately , defaced with a white wine glass; nowadays the gin pennant is the &quot;starboard&quot; manoeuvering signal pennant defaced with a wine or cocktail glass. Its colour, size and position when hoisted were all significant as the aim was for the pennant to be as inconspicuous as possible, thereby having fewer ships sight it and subsequently accept the invitation for drinks. The gin pennant is still in regular use by Commonwealth navies, such as the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Within the RAN it is common practice, whilst in port, for junior officers of one ship to attempt to raise the gin pennant on the halyard of another ship, thereby forcing that ship to put on free drinks for the officers of the ship that managed to raise the pennant. If, however the junior officers are caught raising the pennant, then it is their ship that must put on free drinks within their Wardroom. Usually this practice is restricted to Commonwealth navies.
* Broad pennant

===House flag===

Merchant ships often fly a flag identifying which company owns the vessel. This was formerly flown from the mainmast but is now usually flown from the jackstaff.
===Private signal===

Private signals are custom designed flags used to symbolize and identify the owner of a boat.

===Yacht club burgee===
Members belonging to a yacht club or sailing organization may fly their club&#x27;s unique burgee both while underway and at anchor (however, not while racing). Sailing vessels may fly the burgee from the main masthead or from a lanyard under the starboard spreader on the mast. Power boats fly the burgee off a short staff on the bow.
===Unit citations===
Warships of various navies may be awarded a unit citation, for which a burgee (tapering flag with swallow-tail fly) is flown when in port.
*Ships of the United States Navy:
**Presidential Unit Citation - yellow with blue stripe on top and red stripe at the bottom.
**Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - green with four yellow stripes divided by two blue and one red stripes at the centre.
**Navy Unit Commendation - symmetrical colouring from the centre: green, red, yellow, blue.
*Ships of the Royal Australian Navy may have:
**Unit Citation for Gallantry - burgee with narrow white band surrounding green field surmounted by a silver star.
**Meritorious Unit Citation - design as above with yellow field.

===Signal flags===

There is a system of International maritime signal flags for each letter of the alphabet, and pennants for the numerals. Each flag (except the R flag) has an additional meaning when flown individually, and they take other meanings in certain combinations.

===Courtesy flag===
A courtesy flag (or courtesy ensign) is flown by a visiting ship in foreign waters as a token of respect. It is often a small (that is, smaller than the ship&#x27;s own national ensign) national maritime flag of the host country, although there are countries (such as Malta) where the national, rather than the maritime flag is correct. The flag is customarily worn at the foremasthead of multi-masted vessels, the dockside yardarm or crosstree of the mast of single-masted vessels, while the house flag would be outboard. It may be flown from the jackstaff of vessels without masts.
==Flag etiquette==

The position of honour on a ship is the quarterdeck at the stern of the ship, and thus ensigns are traditionally flown either from an ensign staff at the ship&#x27;s stern, or from a gaff rigged over the stern.

The rule that the highest flown flag takes precedence does not apply on board a ship: a flag flown at the stern is always in a superior position to a flag flown elsewhere on the ship, even if the latter is higher up.

The priority of hoisting locations depends on the rig of the vessel. With sloops, ketches and schooners the starboard yardarm or spreader of the highest or main mast is the second most honoured position (that is, after the ensign at the stern). Next after the starboard spreader is the port spreader. House flags (those defining the owner) are usually flown from the mainmast truck. When a club burgee is flown, it will normally be hoisted to the truck of the most forward mast. On a sloop, then, not having a foremast, the house flag could be moved to the port spreader if the starboard spreader was in use, and a burgee was being flown. On a ketch, the house flag would be moved to the mizzen.

When in port, the ensign should always be flown from the staff at the stern. This is traditional, because in former times the gaff was then lowered along with the mizzen sail. The only ensign ever flown from the starboard spreader or yardarm is that of a nation being visited. This is known as a courtesy hoisting or a courtesy flag.

At sea, it used to be that the ensign was flown from the mizzen gaff. When Bermudian sails came into general use, some skippers started to fly the ensign from two-thirds the way up the main-sail leech. Many consider this an affectation with the past. Others have taken to flying the ensign from a backstay. These are not good locations because the flag does not fly out well when hoisted raked forward.

The Canadian Heritage web page states:
Another recent custom has been to fly a burgee and/or a cruising or power squadron flag from the starboard spreader. This custom has arisen because many sailboats today place a racing flag or wind indicator at the masthead.

Motor boats without masts should always fly the ensign from an ensign staff at the stern. Conventionally, courtesy flags are flown from the jackstaff at the bow. This seems to some landsmen as being a reversal of priorities. However, a boat is steered by the stern and this gives it pride of place.

Nautical etiquette requires that merchant vessels dip their ensigns in salute to passing warships, which acknowledge the salute by dipping their ensigns in return. Contrary to popular belief the United States Navy does dip the Stars and Stripes in acknowledgement of salutes rendered to it. Merchant vessels traditionally fly the ensign of the nation in whose territorial waters they are sailing at the starboard yard-arm. This is known as a courtesy flag, as for yachts.

The flying of the ensigns of two countries, one above the other, on the same staff is a sign that the vessel concerned has been captured or has surrendered during wartime. The ensign flying in the inferior, or lower, position is that of the country the ship has been captured from; conversely, the ensign flying in the superior, or upper position, is that of the country that has captured the ship.

===Dressing overall===

As a sign of celebration, ships in harbour may be dressed overall.

<doc id="500639" wikidata="Q87138" url="?curid=500639" title="Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)">
<text>The Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 was fought between Greece and the Turkish National Movement during the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I, between 15 May 1919 and 14 October 1922. This conflict was a part of the Turkish War of Independence.

The Greek campaign was launched primarily because the western Allies, particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, recently defeated in World War I. Greek claims stemmed from the fact that Western Anatolia had been part of Ancient Greece and the Byzantine Empire before the Turks conquered the area in the 12th–15th centuries. The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in Smyrna (now İzmir), on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, including the cities of Manisa, Balıkesir, Aydın, Kütahya, Bursa, and Eskişehir. Their advance was checked by Turkish forces at the Battle of the Sakarya in 1921. The Greek front collapsed with the Turkish counter-attack in August 1922, and the war effectively ended with the recapture of Smyrna by Turkish forces and the great fire of Smyrna.

As a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish National Movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving Eastern Thrace and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the Treaty of Sèvres to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The Treaty of Lausanne recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Anatolia, Istanbul, and Eastern Thrace. The Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in a population exchange.

==Background==

===Geopolitical context===

The geopolitical context of this conflict is linked to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire which was a direct consequence of World War I and involvement of the Ottomans in the Middle Eastern theatre. The Greeks received an order to land in Smyrna by the Triple Entente as part of the partition. During this war, the Ottoman government collapsed completely and the Ottoman Empire was divided amongst the victorious Entente powers with the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres on 10 August 1920.

There were a number of secret agreements regarding the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. The Triple Entente had made contradictory promises about post-war arrangements concerning Greek hopes in Asia Minor.

The western Allies, particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire if Greece entered the war on the Allied side. These included Eastern Thrace, the islands of Imbros (İmroz, since 29 July 1979 Gökçeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada), and parts of western Anatolia around the city of Smyrna, which contained sizable ethnic Greek populations.

The Italian and Anglo-French repudiation of the Agreement of St.-Jean-de-Maurienne signed on 26 April 1917, which settled the &quot;Middle Eastern interest&quot; of Italy, was overridden with the Greek occupation, as Smyrna (İzmir) was part of the territory promised to Italy. Before the occupation the Italian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, angry about the possibility of the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia, left the conference and did not return to Paris until 5 May. The absence of the Italian delegation from the Conference ended up facilitating Lloyd George&#x27;s efforts to persuade France and the United States to support Greece and prevent Italian operations in Western Anatolia.

According to some historians, it was the Greek occupation of Smyrna that created the Turkish National movement. Arnold J. Toynbee argues: &quot;The war between Turkey and Greece which burst out at this time was a defensive war for safeguarding of the Turkish homelands in Anatolia. It was a result of the Allied policy of imperialism operating in a foreign state, the military resources and powers of which were seriously under-estimated; it was provoked by the unwarranted invasion of a Greek army of occupation.&quot; According to others, the landing of the Greek troops in Smyrna was part of Eleftherios Venizelos&#x27;s plan, inspired by the Megali Idea, to liberate the large Greek populations in the Asia Minor. Prior to the Great Fire of Smyrna, Smyrna had a greater Greek population than the Greek capital, Athens. Athens, before the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey, had a population of 473,000, while the central kaza of Smyrna, according to Ottoman Census, in 1914, had a Greek population of 73,676. The entire Aydın Vilayet including modern İzmir, Manisa, Aydın, and Denizli provinces had a Greek population of 299,096, while the sanjak of Muğla had a Greek population of 19,923.

===The Greek community in Anatolia===
One of the reasons proposed by the Greek government for launching the Asia Minor expedition was that there was a sizeable Greek-speaking Orthodox Christian population inhabiting Anatolia that needed protection. Greeks had lived in Asia Minor since antiquity, and in 1912, there were 2.5 million Greeks in the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Census of 1906–1907 gives a higher figure for the entire Greek Orthodox population including Orthodox Albanians, Slavic-speakers, Vlachs, Arab Orthodox Christians, of the empire amounted to 2,823,063. According to the Ottoman Census of 1914 the Greek Orthodox population of Ottoman Empire after losing its Balkan and Aegean Island provinces, including 188,047 Arab Orthodox Christians from modern-day Syria, Lebanon and Israel was 1,729,738. The suggestion that the Greeks constituted the majority of the population in the lands claimed by Greece has been contested by a number of historians. Cedric James Lowe and Michael L. Dockrill also argued that Greek claims about Smyrna were at best debatable, since Greeks constituted perhaps a bare majority, more likely a large minority in the Smyrna Vilayet, &quot;which lay in an overwhelmingly Turkish Anatolia.&quot; Precise demographics are further obscured by the Ottoman policy of dividing the population according to religion rather than descent, language, or self-identification. On the other hand, contemporaneous British and American statistics (1919) support the point that the Greek element was the most numerous in the region of Smyrna, counting 375,000, while Muslims were 325,000.

Greek Prime Minister Venizelos stated to a British newspaper that &quot;Greece is not making war against Islam, but against the anachronistic Ottoman Government, and its corrupt, ignominious, and bloody administration, with a view to expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of Greeks.&quot;

To an extent, the above danger may have been overstated by Venizelos as a negotiating card on the table of Sèvres, in order to gain the support of the Allied governments. For example, the Young Turks were not in power at the time of the war, which makes such a justification less straightforward. Most of the leaders of that regime had fled the country at the end of World War I and the Ottoman government in Constantinople was already under British control. Furthermore, Venizelos had already revealed his desires for annexation of territories from the Ottoman Empire in the early stages of World War I, before these massacres had taken place. In a letter sent to Greek King Constantine in January 1915, he wrote that: &quot;I have the impression that the concessions to Greece in Asia Minor ... would be so extensive that another equally large and not less rich Greece will be added to the doubled Greece which emerged from the victorious Balkan wars.&quot;

Through its failure, the Greek invasion may have instead exacerbated the atrocities that it was supposed to prevent. Arnold J. Toynbee blamed the policies pursued by Great Britain and Greece, and the decisions of the Paris Peace conference as factors leading to the atrocities committed by both sides during and after the war: &quot;The Greeks of &#x27;Pontus&#x27; and the Turks of the Greek occupied territories, were in some degree victims of Mr. Venizelos&#x27;s and Mr. Lloyd George&#x27;s original miscalculations at Paris.&quot;

===Greek irredentism===
One of the main motivations for initiating the war was to realize the Megali (Great) Idea, a core concept of Greek nationalism. The Megali Idea was an irredentist vision of a restoration of a Greater Greece on both sides of the Aegean that would incorporate territories with Greek populations outside the borders of the Kingdom of Greece, which was initially very small – roughly half the size of the present-day Greek Republic. From the time of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, the Megali Idea had played a major role in Greek politics. Greek politicians, since the independence of the Greek state, had made several speeches on the issue of the &quot;historic inevitability of the expansion of the Greek Kingdom.&quot; For instance, Greek politician Ioannis Kolettis voiced this conviction in the assembly in 1844: &quot;There are two great centres of Hellenism. Athens is the capital of the Kingdom. Constantinople is the great capital, the City, the dream and hope of all Greeks.&quot;

The Great Idea was not merely the product of 19th century nationalism. It was, in one of its aspects, deeply rooted in many Greeks&#x27; religious consciousnesses. This aspect was the recovery of Constantinople for Christendom and the reestablishment of the Christian Byzantine Empire which had fallen in 1453. &quot;Ever since this time the recovery of St. Sophia and the City had been handed down from generation to generation as the destiny and aspiration of the Greek Orthodox.&quot; The Megali Idea, besides Constantinople, included most traditional lands of the Greeks including Crete, Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia, Thrace, the Aegean Islands, Cyprus, the coastlands of Asia Minor and Pontus on the Black Sea. Asia Minor was an essential part of the Greek world and an area of enduring Greek cultural dominance. In antiquity, from late Bronze Age up to the Roman conquest, Greek city-states had even exercised political control of most of the region, except the period ca. 550–470 BC when it was part of the Achaimenid Persian Empire. Later, during Middle Ages, the region had belonged to the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century, when the first Seljuk Turk raids reached it.

===The National Schism in Greece===
The National Schism in Greece was the deep split of Greek politics and society between two factions, the one led by Eleftherios Venizelos and the other by King Constantine, that predated World War I but escalated significantly over the decision on which side Greece should support during the war.

The United Kingdom had hoped that strategic considerations might persuade Constantine to join the cause of the Allies, but the King and his supporters insisted on strict neutrality, especially whilst the outcome of the conflict was hard to predict. In addition, family ties and emotional attachments made it difficult for Constantine to decide which side to support during World War I. The King&#x27;s dilemma was further increased when the Ottomans and the Bulgarians, both having grievances and aspirations against the Greek Kingdom, joined the Central Powers.

Though Constantine did remain decidedly neutral, Prime Minister of Greece Eleftherios Venizelos had from an early point decided that Greece&#x27;s interests would be best served by joining the Entente and started diplomatic efforts with the Allies to prepare the ground for concessions following an eventual victory. The disagreement and the subsequent dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two, which spilled over into their followers and the wider Greek society. Greece became divided into two radically opposed political camps, as Venizelos set up a separate state in Northern Greece, and eventually, with Allied support, forced the King to abdicate. In May 1917, after the exile of Constantine, Venizélos returned to Athens and allied with the Entente. Greek military forces (though divided between supporters of the monarchy and supporters of &quot;Venizelism&quot;) began to take part in military operations against the Bulgarian Army on the border.

The act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post–World War I Greece. The country&#x27;s foremost political formations, the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalists, already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre-war politics, reached a state of outright hatred towards each other. Both parties viewed the other&#x27;s actions during the First World War as politically illegitimate and treasonous. This enmity inevitably spread throughout Greek society, creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the failed Asia Minor campaign and resulted in much social unrest in the inter-war years.

==Greek expansion==

The military aspect of the war began with the Armistice of Mudros. The military operations of the Greco-Turkish war can be roughly divided into three main phases: the first phase, spanning the period from May 1919 to October 1920, encompassed the Greek Landings in Asia Minor and their consolidation along the Aegean Coast. The second phase lasted from October 1920 to August 1921, and was characterised by Greek offensive operations. The third and final phase lasted until August 1922, when the strategic initiative was held by the Turkish Army.

===Landing at Smyrna (May 1919)===

On 15 May 1919, twenty thousand Greek soldiers landed in Smyrna and took control of the city and its surroundings under cover of the Greek, French, and British navies. Legal justifications for the landings was found in Article 7 of the Armistice of Mudros, which allowed the Allies &quot;to occupy any strategic points in the event of any situation arising which threatens the security of Allies.&quot; The Greeks had already brought their forces into Eastern Thrace (apart from Constantinople and its region).

The Christian population of Smyrna (mainly Greeks and Armenians), according to different sources, was either almost as much or greater than the Muslim Turkish population of the city. The Greek army included 2,500 Armenian volunteers. The majority of the Greek population residing in the city greeted the Greek troops as liberators.

===Greek summer offensives (Summer 1920)===
During the summer of 1920, the Greek army launched a series of successful offensives in the directions of the Büyük Menderes River (Meander) Valley, Bursa (Prusa) and Alaşehir (Philadelphia). The overall strategic objective of these operations, which were met by increasingly stiff Turkish resistance, was to provide strategic depth to the defence of Smyrna. To that end, the Greek zone of occupation was extended over all of Western and most of North-Western Anatolia.

===Treaty of Sèvres (August 1920)===
In return for the contribution of the Greek army on the side of the Allies, the Allies supported the assignment of eastern Thrace and the millet of Smyrna to Greece. This treaty ended the First World War in Asia Minor and, at the same time, sealed the fate of the Ottoman Empire. Henceforth, the Ottoman Empire would no longer be a European power.

On 10 August 1920, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Sèvres ceding to Greece Thrace, up to the Chatalja lines. More importantly, Turkey renounced to Greece all rights over Imbros and Tenedos, retaining the small territories of Constantinople, the islands of Marmara, and &quot;a tiny strip of European territory&quot;. The Straits of Bosporus were placed under an International Commission, as they were now open to all.

Turkey was furthermore forced to transfer to Greece &quot;the exercise of her rights of sovereignty&quot; over Smyrna in addition to &quot;a considerable Hinterland, merely retaining a &#x27;flag over an outer fort&#x27;.&quot; Though Greece administered the Smyrna enclave, its sovereignty remained, nominally, with the Sultan. According to the provisions of the Treaty, Smyrna was to maintain a local parliament and, if within five years time she asked to be incorporated within the Kingdom of Greece, the provision was made that the League of Nations would hold a plebiscite to decide on such matters.

The treaty was never ratified by the Ottoman Empire nor Greece.

===Greek advance (October 1920)===
In October 1920, the Greek army advanced further east into Anatolia, with the encouragement of Lloyd George, who intended to increase pressure on the Turkish and Ottoman governments to sign the Treaty of Sèvres. This advance began under the Liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, but soon after the offensive began, Venizelos fell from power and was replaced by Dimitrios Gounaris. The strategic objective of these operations was to defeat the Turkish Nationalists and force Mustafa Kemal into peace negotiations. The advancing Greeks, still holding superiority in numbers and modern equipment at this point, had hoped for an early battle in which they were confident of breaking up ill-equipped Turkish forces. Yet they met with little resistance, as the Turks managed to retreat in an orderly fashion and avoid encirclement. Churchill said: &quot;The Greek columns trailed along the country roads passing safely through many ugly defiles, and at their approach the Turks, under strong and sagacious leadership, vanished into the recesses of Anatolia.&quot;

===Change in Greek government (November 1920)===

During October 1920, King Alexander, who had been installed on the Greek throne on 11 June 1917 when his father Constantine was pushed into exile by the Venizelists, was bitten by a monkey kept at the Royal Gardens and died within days from sepsis. After King Alexander died without heirs, the legislative elections scheduled to be held on 1 November 1920, suddenly became the focus of a new conflict between the supporters of Venizelos and the Royalists. The anti-Venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government, which, due to the war, had stayed in power without elections since 1915. At the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in Asia Minor, without though presenting a clear plan as to how this would happen. On the contrary, Venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not seem to go anywhere. The majority of the Greek people were both war-weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the Venizelists, so opted for change. To the surprise of many, Venizelos won only 118 out of the total 369 seats. The crushing defeat obliged Venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country. To this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned.

The new government under Dimitrios Gounaris prepared for a plebiscite on the return of King Constantine. 

A month later a plebiscite called for the return of King Constantine. Soon after his return, the King replaced many of the World War I Venizelist officers and appointed inexperienced monarchist officers to senior positions. The leadership of the campaign was given to Anastasios Papoulas, while King Constantine himself assumed nominally the overall command. The High Commissioner in Smyrna, Aristeidis Stergiadis, however was not removed.

The British and French governments promised the Greeks 850 million gold franks,but because of the government change in Greece, and heavy losses in Cilicia, the French government stopped supporting the Greeks until a small period between the Battle of Kütahya-Eskişehir and the end of the Battle of the Sakarya. The British government were also uneasy, but they preferred to wait. The Greeks, afraid of losing the support of the British, did not remove some Venizelist officers, and Britain continued to promise 850 million gold franks.

=== Gediz Offensive ===
After the summer offensive of 1920, the Turkish irregular forces attacked the Greek Army which is under the command of Constantinos Matenas. Even though the offensive was successful, the opportunity of sieging the and destroying of the 13th Infantry Division of Greece (the division had nearly ~15,000 men) was gone because of the arbitrary behaviours of the Kuva-yi Seyyare under the command of the Çerkes Ethem. Because of these events, the Grand National Assembly of the Turkish Nationalists started to create a regular force. The regular forces were going to lose the Battle of Kütahya-Eskişehir only against the Greek Armed Forces.

===Battles of İnönü (December 1920 – March 1921)===
By December 1920, the Greeks had advanced on two fronts, approaching Eskişehir from the North West and from Smyrna, and had consolidated their occupation zone. In early 1921 they resumed their advance with small scale reconnaissance incursions that met stiff resistance from entrenched Turkish Nationalists, who were increasingly better prepared and equipped as a regular army.

The Greek advance was halted for the first time at the First Battle of İnönü on 11 January 1921. Even though this was a minor confrontation involving only one Greek division, it held political significance for the fledgling Turkish revolutionaries. This development led to Allied proposals to amend the Treaty of Sèvres at a conference in London where both the Turkish Revolutionary and Ottoman governments were represented.

Although some agreements were reached with Italy, France and Britain, the decisions were not agreed to by the Greek government, who believed that they still retained the strategic advantage and could yet negotiate from a stronger position. The Greeks initiated another attack on 27 March, the Second Battle of İnönü, where the Turkish troops fiercely resisted and finally halted the Greeks on 30 March. The British government supported Greeks with 6in howitzer during Second Battle of İnönü. The Turkish forces received arms assistance from Soviet Russia.

===Shift of support towards the Turkish national movement===
By this time all other fronts had been settled in favour of the Turks, freeing more resources for the main threat of the Greek Army. France and Italy concluded private agreements with the Turkish revolutionaries in recognition of their mounting strength. They viewed Greece as a British client, and sold military equipment to the Turks. The new Bolshevik government of Russia became friendly to the Turkish revolutionaries, as shown in the Treaty of Moscow (1921). The Bolsheviks supported Mustafa Kemal and his forces with money and ammunition. In 1920 alone, Bolshevik Russia supplied the Kemalists with 6,000 rifles, over 5 million rifle cartridges, and 17,600 shells as well as 200.6 kg (442.2 lb) of gold bullion. In the subsequent two years the amount of aid increased.

===Battle of Afyonkarahisar-Eskişehir (July 1921)===

Between 27 June and 20 July 1921, a reinforced Greek army of nine divisions launched a major offensive, the greatest thus far, against the Turkish troops commanded by İsmet İnönü on the line of Afyonkarahisar-Kütahya-Eskişehir. The plan of the Greeks was to cut Anatolia in two, as the above towns were on the main rail-lines connecting the hinterland with the coast. Eventually, after breaking the stiff Turkish defences, they occupied these strategically important centres. Instead of pursuing and decisively crippling the nationalists&#x27; military capacity, the Greek Army halted. In consequence, and despite their defeat, the Turks managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on the east of the Sakarya River, where they organised their last line of defence.

This was the major decision that sealed the fate of the Greek campaign in Anatolia. The state and Army leadership, including King Constantine, Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, and General Anastasios Papoulas, met at Kütahya where they debated the future of the campaign. The Greeks, with their faltering morale rejuvenated, failed to appraise the strategic situation that favoured the defending side; instead, pressed for a &#x27;final solution&#x27;, the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue the Turks and attack their last line of defence close to Ankara. The military leadership was cautious and asked for more reinforcements and time to prepare, but did not go against the politicians. Only a few voices supported a defensive stance, including Ioannis Metaxas. Constantine by this time had little actual power and did not argue either way. After a delay of almost a month that gave time to the Turks to organise their defence, seven of the Greek divisions crossed east of the Sakarya River.

===Battle of Sakarya (August and September 1921)===
Following the retreat of the Turkish troops under İsmet İnönü in the battle of Kütahya-Eskişehir the Greek Army advanced afresh to the Sakarya River (Sangarios in Greek), less than west of Ankara. Constantine&#x27;s battle cry was &quot;to Angira&quot; and the British officers were invited, in anticipation, to a victory dinner in the city of Kemal. It was envisaged that the Turkish Revolutionaries, who had consistently avoided encirclement would be drawn into battle in defence of their capital and destroyed in a battle of attrition.

Despite the Soviet help, supplies were short as the Turkish army prepared to meet the Greeks. Owners of private rifles, guns and ammunition had to surrender them to the army and every household was required to provide a pair of underclothing and sandals. Meanwhile, the Turkish parliament, not happy with the performance of İsmet İnönü as the Commander of the Western Front, wanted Mustafa Kemal and Chief of General Staff Fevzi Çakmak to take control.

Greek forces marched for a week through the desert to reach attack positions, so the Turks could see them coming. Food supplies were 40 tons of bread and salt, sugar and tea, the rest to be found on the way.

The advance of the Greek Army faced fierce resistance which culminated in the 21-day Battle of Sakarya (23 August – 13 September 1921). The Turkish defense positions were centred on series of heights, and the Greeks had to storm and occupy them. The Turks held certain hilltops and lost others, while some were lost and recaptured several times over. Yet the Turks had to conserve men, for the Greeks held the numerical advantage. The crucial moment came when the Greek army tried to take Haymana, south of Ankara, but the Turks held out. Greek advances into Anatolia had lengthened their lines of supply and communication and they were running out of ammunition. The ferocity of the battle exhausted both sides but the Greeks were the first to withdraw to their previous lines. The thunder of cannon was plainly heard in Ankara throughout the battle.

That was the furthest in Anatolia the Greeks would advance, and within a few weeks they withdrew in an orderly manner back to the lines that they had held in June. The Turkish Parliament awarded both Mustafa Kemal and Fevzi Çakmak with the title of Field Marshal for their service in this battle. To this day no other person has received this five-star general title from the Turkish Republic.

===Stalemate (September 1921 – August 1922)===

Having failed to reach a military solution, Greece appealed to the Allies for help, but early in 1922 Britain, France and Italy decided that the Treaty of Sèvres could not be enforced and had to be revised. In accordance with this decision, under successive treaties, the Italian and French troops evacuated their positions, leaving the Greeks exposed.

In March 1922, the Allies proposed an armistice. Feeling that he now held the strategic advantage, Mustafa Kemal declined any settlement while the Greeks remained in Anatolia and intensified his efforts to re-organise the Turkish military for the final offensive against the Greeks. At the same time, the Greeks strengthened their defensive positions, but were increasingly demoralised by the inactivity of remaining on the defensive and the prolongation of the war. The Greek government was desperate to get some military support from the British or at least secure a loan, so it developed an ill-thought plan to force the British diplomatically, by threatening their positions in Constantinople, but this never materialised. The occupation of Constantinople would have been an easy task at this time because the Allied troops garrisoned there were much fewer than the Greek forces in Thrace (two divisions). The result though was instead to weaken the Greek defences in Smyrna by withdrawing troops. The Turkish forces, on the other hand, were recipients of significant assistance from Soviet Russia. On 29 April, the Soviet authorities supplied the Turkish consul critical quantities of arms and ammunition, sufficient for three Turkish divisions. On 3 May, the Soviet government handed over 33,500,000 gold rubles to Turkeythe balance of the credit of 10,000,000 gold rubles.

Voices in Greece increasingly called for withdrawal, and demoralizing propaganda spread among the troops. Some of the removed Venizelist officers organised a movement of &quot;National Defense&quot; and planned a coup to secede from Athens, but never gained Venizelos&#x27;s endorsement and all their actions remained fruitless.

Historian Malcolm Yapp wrote that:
==Turkish counter-attack==

===Dumlupınar===
The Turks launched a counter-attack on 26 August, what has come to be known to the Turks as the &quot;Great Offensive&quot; (&quot;Büyük Taarruz&quot;). The major Greek defense positions were overrun on 26 August, and Afyon fell next day. On 30 August, the Greek army was defeated decisively at the Battle of Dumlupınar, with many of its soldiers captured or killed and a large part of its equipment lost. This date is celebrated as Victory Day, a national holiday in Turkey and salvage day of Kütahya. During the battle, the Greek generals Nikolaos Trikoupis and Kimon Digenis were captured by the Turkish forces. General Trikoupis learned only after his capture that he had been recently appointed Commander-in-Chief in General Hatzianestis&#x27; place. According to the Greek Army General Staff, major generals Nikolaos Trikoupis and Kimon Digenis surrendered on 30 August 1922 by the village of Karaja Hissar due to lack of ammunition, food and supplies. On 1 September, Mustafa Kemal issued his famous order to the Turkish army: &quot;Armies, your first goal is the Mediterranean, Forward!&quot;

===Turkish advance on Smyrna===

On 2 September, Eskişehir was captured and the Greek government asked Britain to arrange a truce that would at least preserve its rule in Smyrna. However Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had categorically refused to acknowledge even a temporary Greek occupation of Smyrna, calling it a foreign occupation, and pursued an aggressive military policy instead. Balıkesir and Bilecik were taken on 6 September, and Aydın the next day. Manisa was taken on 8 September. The government in Athens resigned. Turkish cavalry entered Smyrna on 9 September. Gemlik and Mudanya fell on 11 September, with an entire Greek division surrendering. The expulsion of the Greek Army from Anatolia was completed on 18 September. As historian George Lenczowski has put it: &quot;Once started, the offensive was a dazzling success. Within two weeks the Turks drove the Greek army back to the Mediterranean Sea.&quot;
The vanguards of Turkish cavalry entered the outskirts of Smyrna on 9 September. On the same day, the Greek headquarters had evacuated the town. The Turkish cavalry rode into the town around eleven o&#x27;clock on the Saturday morning of 9 September. On 10 September, with the possibility of social disorder, Mustafa Kemal was quick to issue a proclamation, sentencing to death any Turkish soldier who harmed non-combatants. A few days before the Turkish capture of the city, Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s messengers distributed leaflets with this order written in Greek. Mustafa Kemal said that the Ankara government would not be held responsible for any occurrence of a massacre.

On 13 September, the Greek and Armenian quarters of the city were burned, while the Turkish as well as Jewish quarters were unharmed. Atrocities were committed against Greek and Armenian populaces, and their properties were pillaged. Most of the eye-witness reports identified troops from the Turkish army having set fire to the city.

===Chanak Crisis===

After re-capturing Smyrna, Turkish forces headed north for the Bosporus, the sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles where the Allied garrisons were reinforced by British, French and Italian troops from Constantinople. In an interview with George Ward Price published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, 15 September, Mustafa Kemal stated that: &quot;Our demands remain the same after our recent victory as they were before. We ask for Asia Minor, Thrace up to the river Maritsa and Constantinople... We must have our capital and I should in that case be obliged to march on Constantinople with my army, which will be an affair of only a few days. I must prefer to obtain possession by negotiation though, naturally I cannot wait indefinitely.&quot;

Around this time, several Turkish officers were sent to infiltrate secretly into Constantinople to help organize Turkish population living in the city in the event of a war. For instance, Ernest Hemingway, who was at the time a war correspondent for the newspaper &quot;Toronto Star,&quot; reported that:
The British cabinet initially decided to resist the Turks if necessary at the Dardanelles and to ask for French and Italian help to enable the Greeks to remain in eastern Thrace. The British government also issued a request for military support from its Dominions. The response from the Dominions was negative (with the exception of New Zealand). Italian and French forces abandoned their positions at the straits and left the British alone to face the Turks.

On 24 September, Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s troops moved into the straits zones and refused British requests to leave. The British cabinet was divided on the matter but eventually any possible armed conflict was prevented. British General Charles Harington, allied commander in Constantinople, kept his men from firing on Turks and warned the British cabinet against any rash adventure. The Greek fleet left Constantinople upon his request. The British finally decided to force the Greeks to withdraw behind the Maritsa in Thrace. This convinced Mustafa Kemal to accept the opening of armistice talks.

==Resolution==
The Armistice of Mudanya was concluded on 11 October 1922. The Allies (Britain, France and Italy) retained control of eastern Thrace and the Bosporus. The Greeks were to evacuate these areas. The agreement came into force starting 15 October 1922, one day after the Greek side agreed to sign it.

The Armistice of Mudanya was followed by the Treaty of Lausanne. Separate from this treaty, Turkey and Greece came to an agreement covering an exchange of populations. Over one million Greek Orthodox Christians were displaced; most of them were resettled in Attica and the newly incorporated Greek territories of Macedonia and Thrace and were exchanged with about 500,000 Muslims displaced from Greek territories.

===Factors contributing to the outcome===
The Greeks estimated, despite warnings from the French and British not to underestimate the enemy, that they would need only three months to defeat the already weakened Turks on their own. Exhausted from four years of bloodshed, no Allied power had the will to engage in a new war and relied on Greece. During the Conference of London in February 1921, the Greek prime minister Kalogeropoulos revealed that the morale of the Greek army was excellent and their courage was undoubted, he added that in his eyes the Kemalists were &quot;not regular soldiers; they merely constituted a rabble worthy of little or no consideration&quot;. Still, the Allies had doubts about Greek military capacity to advance in Anatolia, facing vast territories, long lines of communication, financial shortcomings of the Greek treasury and above all the toughness of the Turkish peasant/soldier. After the Greek failure to rout and defeat the new established Turkish army in the First and Second Battle of İnönü the Italians began to evacuate their occupation zone in southwestern Anatolia in July 1921. Furthermore, the Italians also claimed that Greece had violated the limits of the Greek occupation laid down by the Council of Four. France, on the other hand, had its own front in Cilicia with the Turkish nationalists. The French, like the other Allied powers, had changed their support to the Turks in order to build a strong buffer state against the Bolsheviks after October 1921 and were looking to leave. After the Greeks had failed again to knock out the Turks in the decisive Battle of Sakarya, the French finally signed the Treaty of Ankara (1921) with the Turks in late October 1921. The Allied Forces ,who came to Black Sea in 1919, forced to leave there by Turkish forces on 1920. After that, supperssing the Pontic rebels had gotten easier for the Turkish 15th division. The Greek Navy bombarded some larger ports (June and July 1921 Inebolu; July 1921 Trabzon, Sinop; August 1921 Rize, Trabzon; September 1921 Araklı, Terme, Trabzon; October 1921 Izmit; June 1922 Samsun). The Greek Navy was able to blockade the Black Sea coast especially before and during the First and Second İnönü, Kütahya–Eskişehir and Sakarya battles, preventing weapon and ammunition shipments.

Having adequate supplies was a constant problem for the Greek Army. Although it was not lacking in men, courage or enthusiasm, it was soon lacking in nearly everything else. Due to her poor economy, Greece could not sustain long-term mobilisation. According to a British report from May 1922, 60,000 Anatolian Greeks, Armenians and Circassians served under arms in the Greek occupation (of this number, 6,000–10,000 were Circassians). In comparison, the Turks also had difficulties to find enough fit men, as a result of 1.5 million military casualties during World War I. Very soon, the Greek Army exceeded the limits of its logistical structure and had no way of retaining such a large territory under constant attack by initially irregular and later regular Turkish troops. The idea that such large force could sustain offensive by mainly &quot;living off the land&quot; proved wrong. Although the Greek Army had to retain a large territory after September 1921, the Greek Army was more motorized than the Turkish Army. The Greek Army had in addition to 63,000 animals for transportation, 4,036 trucks and 1,776 automobiles/ambulances,(according to the Greek Army History Directorate total number of trucks, including ambulances, was 2500). Only 840 of them have been used for the advance to Angora, also 1.600 camels and a great number of ox and horse carts, whereas the Turkish Army relied on transportation with animals. They had 67,000 animals (of whom were used as: 3,141 horse carts, 1,970 ox carts, 2,318 tumbrels and 71 phaetons), but only 198 trucks and 33 automobiles/ambulances.

As the supply situation worsened for the Greeks, things improved for the Turks. After the Armistice of Mudros, the Allies had dissolved the Ottoman army, confiscated all Ottoman weapons and ammunition, hence the Turkish National Movement which was in the progress of establishing a new army, was in desperate need of weapons. In addition to the weapons not yet confiscated by the Allies, they enjoyed Soviet support from abroad, in return for giving Batum to the Soviet Union. The Soviets also provided monetary aid to the Turkish National Movement, not to the extent that they promised but almost in sufficient amount to make up the large deficiencies in the promised supply of arms. One of the main reasons for Soviet support was that Allied forces were fighting on Russian soil against the Bolshevik regime, therefore the Turkish opposition was much favored by Moscow. The Italians were embittered from their loss of the Smyrna mandate to the Greeks, and they used their base in Antalya to arm and train Turkish troops to assist the Kemalists against the Greeks.

A British military attaché, who inspected the Greek Army in June 1921, was quoted as saying, &quot;[It is a] more efficient fighting machine than I have ever seen it.&quot; Later he wrote: &quot;The Greek Army of Asia Minor, which now stood ready and eager to advance, was the most formidable force the nation had ever put into field. Its morale was high. Judged by Balkan standards, its staff was capable, its discipline and organization good.&quot; Turkish troops had a determined and competent strategic and tactical command, manned by World War I veterans. The Turkish army enjoyed the advantage of being in defence, executed in the new form of &#x27;area defence&#x27;.

Mustafa Kemal presented himself as revolutionary to the communists, protector of tradition and order to the conservatives, patriot soldier to the nationalists, and a Muslim leader for the religious, so he was able to recruit all Turkish elements and motivate them to fight. The Turkish National Movement attracted sympathizers especially from the Muslims of the far east countries. The Khilafet Committee in Bombay started a fund to help the Turkish National struggle and sent both financial aid and constant letters of encouragement. Not all of the money arrived, and Mustafa Kemal decided not use the money that was sent by the Khilafet Committee. The money was restored in the Ottoman Bank. After the war, it was later used for the founding of the Türkiye İş Bankası.

==Atrocities and ethnic cleansing by both sides==

===Turkish genocides of Greeks and Armenians===

Rudolph J. Rummel estimated that from 1900 to 1923, various Turkish regimes killed from 3,500,000 to over 4,300,000 Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians. Rummel estimates that 440,000 Armenian civilians and 264,000 Greek civilians were killed by Turkish forces during the Turkish War of Independence between 1919 and 1922. However, he also gives the figures in his study of between 1.428 and 4.388 million dead of whom 2.781 millions were Armenian, Greek, Nestorians, Turks, Circassians and others, in line 488. British historian and journalist Arnold J. Toynbee stated that when he toured the region he saw numerous Greek villages that had been burned to the ground. Toynbee also stated that the Turkish troops had clearly, individually and deliberately, burned down each house in these villages, pouring petrol on them and taking care to ensure that they were totally destroyed. There were massacres throughout 1920–23, the period of the Turkish War of Independence, especially of Armenians in the East and the South, and against the Greeks in the Black Sea Region. Ultimately, by 1922, the majority of Ottoman Greeks of Anatolia had either become refugees or had died.

Greeks suffered in the Turkish labor battalions. Many of the Greek deportations involved chiefly women and children as, by early 1915, most army-age Greek men had been mobilized in Ottoman labor battalions or had fled their homes to avoid conscription. According to Rendel, atrocities such as deportations involving death marches, starvation in labour camps etc. were referred to as &quot;white massacres&quot;. Ottoman official Rafet Bey was active in the genocide of the Greeks and in November 1916, Austrian consul in Samsun, Kwiatkowski, reported that he said to him &quot;We must finish off the Greeks as we did with the Armenians ... today I sent squads to the interior to kill every Greek on sight&quot;. According to a French report in 1918:

The miserable men in the labor battalions are dispersed in different directions in the far ends of the Empire, from the shores of Asia Minor and the Black Sea to the Caucasus, Bagdad, Mesopotamia and Egypt; some of them to build military roads, others to dig the tunnels of Bagdad railway...I saw those wretched men in the hospitals of Konya, stretched upon their beds or on the ground, resembling living skeletons, longing for death to end their sufferings...To describe this disastrous situation I shall conclude that as a result of high level of mortality the cemetery of Konya is full of corpses of the soldiers serving in the labor battalions, and in each tomb there lie four, five or sometimes even six corpses just like dogs.

Sivas province governor Ebubekir Hâzım Tepeyran said in 1919 that the massacres were so horrible that he could not bear to report them. He referred to the atrocities committed against Greeks in the Black Sea region, and according to the official tally 11,181 Greeks were murdered in 1921 by the Central Army under the command of Nurettin Pasha (who is infamous for the killing of Archbishop Chrysostomos). Some parliamentary deputies demanded that Nurettin Pasha be sentenced to death and it was decided to put him on trial, although the trial was later revoked by the intervention of Mustafa Kemal. Taner Akçam wrote that according to one newspaper, Nurettin Pasha had proposed the killing of all the remaining Greek and Armenian populations in Anatolia, a suggestion rejected by Mustafa Kemal.

There were also several contemporary Western newspaper articles reporting the atrocities committed by Turkish forces against Christian populations living in Anatolia, mainly Greek and Armenian civilians. For instance, according to the London &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;The Turkish authorities frankly state it is their deliberate intention to let all the Greeks die, and their actions support their statement.&quot; An Irish paper, the &quot;Belfast News Letter&quot; wrote, &quot;The appalling tale of barbarity and cruelty now being practiced by the Angora Turks is part of a systematic policy of extermination of Christian minorities in Asia Minor.&quot; According to the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, the Turks felt that they needed to murder their Christian minorities due to Christian superiority in terms of industriousness and the consequent Turkish feelings of jealousy and inferiority. The paper wrote: &quot;The result has been to breed feelings of alarm and jealousy in the minds of the Turks, which in later years have driven them to depression. They believe that they cannot compete with their Christian subjects in the arts of peace and that the Christians and Greeks especially are too industrious and too well educated as rivals. Therefore, from time to time they have striven to try and redress the balance by expulsion and massacre. That has been the position generations past in Turkey again if the Great powers are callous and unwise enough to attempt to perpetuate Turkish misrule over Christians.&quot; According to the newspaper the Scotsman, on 18 August 1920, in the Feival district of Karamusal, South-East of Ismid in Asia Minor, the Turks massacred 5,000 Christians. There were also massacres during this period against Armenians, continuing the policies of the 1915 Armenian Genocide according to some Western newspapers. On 25 February 1922, 24 Greek villages in the Pontus region were burnt to the ground. An American newspaper, the &quot;Atlanta Observer&quot; wrote: &quot;The smell of the burning bodies of women and children in Pontus&quot; said the message &quot;comes as a warning of what is awaiting the Christian in Asia Minor after the withdrawal of the Hellenic army.&quot; In the first few months of 1922, 10,000 Greeks were killed by advancing Kemalist forces, according to Belfast News Letter. According to the &quot;Philadelphia Evening Bulletin&quot; the Turks continued the practice of slavery, seizing women and children for their harems and raping numerous women. The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote that Turkish authorities also prevented missionaries and humanitarian aid groups from assisting Greek civilians who had their homes burned, the Turkish authorities leaving these people to die despite abundant aid. The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote: &quot;the Turks are trying to exterminate the Greek population with more vigor than they exercised towards the Armenians in 1915.&quot; German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, as well as the 1922 memorandum compiled by British diplomat George W. Rendel on &quot;Turkish Massacres and Persecutions&quot;, provided evidence for series of systematic massacres and ethnic cleansing of the Greeks in Asia Minor.

Henry Morgenthau, the United States ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1916, accused the &quot;Turkish government&quot; of a campaign of &quot;outrageous terrorizing, cruel torturing, driving of women into harems, debauchery of innocent girls, the sale of many of them at 80 cents each, the murdering of hundreds of thousands and the deportation to and starvation in the desert of other hundreds of thousands, [and] the destruction of hundreds of villages and many cities&quot;, all part of &quot;the willful execution&quot; of a &quot;scheme to annihilate the Armenian, Greek and Syrian Christians of Turkey&quot;. However, months prior to the First World War, 100,000 Greeks were deported to Greek islands or the interior which Morgenthau stated, &quot;for the larger part these were bona-fide deportations; that is, the Greek inhabitants were actually removed to new places and were not subjected to wholesale massacre. It was probably the reason that the civilized world did not protest against these deportations&quot;.

US Consul-General George Horton, whose account has been criticised by scholars as anti-Turkish, claimed, &quot;One of the cleverest statements circulated by the Turkish propagandists is to the effect that the massacred Christians were as bad as their executioners, that it was &#x27;50–50&#x27;.&quot; On this issue he comments: &quot;Had the Greeks, after the massacres in the Pontus and at Smyrna, massacred all the Turks in Greece, the record would have been 50–50almost.&quot; As an eye-witness, he also praises Greeks for their &quot;conduct ... toward the thousands of Turks residing in Greece, while the ferocious massacres were going on&quot;, which, according to his opinion, was &quot;one of the most inspiring and beautiful chapters in all that country&#x27;s history&quot;.

Atrocities against Pontic Greeks living in the Pontus region is recognized in Greece and Cyprus as the Pontian Genocide. According to a proclamation made in 2002 by the then-governor of New York (where a sizeable population of Greek Americans resides), George Pataki, the Greeks of Asia Minor endured immeasurable cruelty during a Turkish government-sanctioned systematic campaign to displace them; destroying Greek towns and villages and slaughtering additional hundreds of thousands of civilians in areas where Greeks composed a majority, as on the Black Sea coast, Pontus, and areas around Smyrna; those who survived were exiled from Turkey and today they and their descendants live throughout the Greek diaspora.
By 9 September 1922, the Turkish army had entered Smyrna, with the Greek authorities having left two days before. Large scale disorder followed, with the Christian population suffering under attacks from soldiers and Turkish inhabitants. The Greek archbishop Chrysostomos had been lynched by a mob which included Turkish soldiers, and on 13 September, a fire from the Armenian quarter of the city had engulfed the Christian waterfront of the city, leaving the city devastated. The responsibility for the fire is a controversial issue; some sources blame Turks, and some sources blame Greeks or Armenians. Some 50,000 to 100,000 Greeks and Armenians were killed in the fire and accompanying massacres.

===Greek massacres of Turks===

British historian Arnold J. Toynbee wrote that there were organized atrocities following the Greek landing at Smyrna on 15 May 1919. He also stated that he and his wife were witnesses to the atrocities perpetrated by Greeks in the Yalova, Gemlik, and Izmit areas and they not only obtained abundant material evidence in the shape of &quot;burnt and plundered houses, recent corpses, and terror stricken survivors&quot; but also witnessed robbery by Greek civilians and arson by Greek soldiers in uniform as they were being perpetrated. Toynbee wrote that as soon as the Greek Army landed, they started committing atrocities against Turkish civilians, as they &quot;laid waste the fertile Maeander (Meander) Valley&quot;, and forced thousands of Turks to take refuge outside the borders of the areas controlled by the Greeks. Secretary of State for the Colonies and later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill comparing the specific activities with the genocide policies perpetrated by the Turkish side noted that the Greek atrocities were on &quot;a minor scale&quot; compared to the &quot;appalling deportations of Greeks from the Trebizond and Samsun district.&quot;

During the Battle of Bergama, the Greek army committed a massacre against Turkish civilians in Menemen killing 200 and injuring 200 people. Some Turkish sources claim that the death count of the Menemen massacre was 1000. On 24 June 1921, a massacre occurred in İzmit, resulting in the death of more than 300 Turkish civilians according to Arnold J. Toynbee.

Elias Venezis, in his book Number 31328, states that the returning Greek Army belonging to the 4th regiment found around 40 dead Greek soldiers and commenced their &quot;Retaliation Workshops&quot;. He mentions that a young Turkish child from Lesbos and a mother was also among the civilians massacred. The skull of the living people (Turks), were slowly cut with a saw. Arms were crushed with weights and eyes were gouged out with whatever tools the Greek soldiers had. He also adds that the Turks were huddled in the shack of the Workshop, watching and waiting in line. In later versions, this part was deleted and revised to only &quot;There was a lot of retaliation then&quot; These events are also mentioned by the mayor of Soma, Osman Nuri, in his telegraph dated 20 June 1919. He stated that more than 50 thousand Muslim refugees had arrived to his jurisdiction from the surroundings of Bergama, and that the Greek soldiers had committed atrocities that are much worse than even the atrocities committed in the Middle Ages. In these events, he adds that the Greek soldiers had turned their atrocities to civilians, which includes murder, rape, and pillaging of households into an amusement for themselves. A similar atrocity was witnessed by Lieutenant Ali Rıza Akıncı on the morning of 8 September 1922, in the railway station of Saruhanlı, which provoked his units to burn the Greek Soldiers in a nearby barn whom they had taken prisoners. He describes the atrocities with the following words: &lt;block&gt;&quot;Nine Turkish villagers were killed, the dead were manipulated to disgrace humanity as long as the world stood still, and nine dead people were turned into a ring by putting the finger of one to the ass of the other, the genitals of one to the mouth of the other.&quot; &lt;/block&gt;

Harold Armstrong, a British officer who was a member of the Inter-Allied Commission, reported that as the Greeks pushed out from Smyrna, they massacred and raped civilians, and burned and pillaged as they went. However, other British officials found no evidence for this claim.

Some testimonies exist of atrocities in Eastern Thrace. In one village the Greek army allegedly demanded 500 gold liras to spare the town; however, after payment, the village was still sacked. Robbery of Muslim civilians were also mentioned in the memories of a local Greek from Şile. There, the Greek non-commissioned officers, and the &quot;Greek deserters&quot;, who had been appointed guards of his homeland, went to the villages to search for rifles. In the villages, they hunted for any rich Turk, and tortured them by hanging the victim upside down, and burning the grass underneath in order for them to reveal where they hid weapons. Then, a Greek from Şile would go and say to him, &quot;Give me a hundred liras and we will save you&quot;. Same method of torture and killing is also verified in the report of Ziya Paşa, the last Ottoman Minister of War, regarding the atrocities in Eastern Thrace dating to 27 April 1921. The report stated that a Muslim woman in the village of Hamidiye, Uzunköprü was hanged upside down in a tree and was burned with the fire below her, while a cat was put inside her underwear while being forced to confess the location of her husband&#x27;s weapons. Moreover, the report included a similar example of the same atrocity done to Efrahim Ağa, the elder muhtar of village Seymen in Silivri. Only this time the victim was hanged straight and was burned from his legs.

The Inter-Allied commission, consisting of British, French, American, and Italian, officers, and the representative of the Geneva International Red Cross, M. Gehri, prepared two separate collaborative reports on their investigations of the Gemlik-Yalova Peninsula Massacres. These reports found that Greek forces committed systematic atrocities against the Turkish inhabitants. The commissioners also mentioned the &quot;burning and looting of Turkish villages&quot;, the &quot;explosion of violence of Greeks and Armenians against the Turks&quot;, and &quot;a systematic plan of destruction and extinction of the Moslem population&quot;. In their report dated 23 May 1921, the Inter-Allied commission stated that &quot;This plan is being carried out by Greek and Armenian bands, which appear to operate under Greek instructions and sometimes even with the assistance of detachments of regular troops&quot;. The Inter-Allied commission also stated that the destruction of villages, and the disappearance of the Muslim population, might have been an objective to create in this region a political situation favourable to the Greek Government. The Allied investigation also pointed out that the specific events were reprisals for the general Turkish oppression of the past years and especially for the Turkish atrocities committed in the Marmara region one year before, when several Greek villages had been burned, and thousands of Greeks massacred. Arnold J. Toynbee wrote that they obtained convincing evidence that similar atrocities had been committed in wider areas all over the remainder of the Greek-occupied territories since June 1921. He argued that &quot;the situation of the Turks in Smyrna City had become what could be called without exaggeration, a &#x27;reign of terror&#x27;; it was to be inferred that their treatment in the country districts had grown worse in proportion.&quot;

In many cases, commanders of the Greek Army allowed and encouraged atrocities. Greek Soldier Hristos Karagiannis mentions in his diaries that in summer 1919, during and after the Battle of Aydın, Lieutenant Colonel Kondylis, who later became the Prime Minister of Greece, gave his soldiers &quot;&quot;the right to do whatever our soul desires&quot;, and this led to some infantrymen committing atrocities. Atrocities were also mentioned in the telegraph of Nurullah Bey, the secretary of the Mutasarrıf of Aydın, dated 9 July 1919, to the State of Internal Affairs. In the telegraph, it is stated that the Greek Army, as well as the local Greek irregular bands, murdered innocent Muslims, including children, secretly and openly raped women, and burned the city down with the help of cannons. During the burning, they killed women and children who were fleeing from the fire with heavy machine guns, and that the ones who couldn&#x27;t flee were burned to death. During the brief Liberation of Aydın (1919) by the Turkish National Force (Kuva-yi Milliye), the lives and properties of the local Greeks, even those who participated in the murders, were secured. After the return of the member of the national force, the Greek Army invaded Aydın once more (this time more vigorously), and &quot;continued their brutality from where they had left off&quot;. Muslims who crossed into the direction of Çine and Denizli were massacred en masse, and prominent officials, including the Mutasarrıf, were arrested, and whether they were alive or not was unknown. Other examples where the Greek Commanders gave soldiers the freedom to commit all levels of atrocities include the events in and around Simav. Hristos Karagiannis in his memoirs mentions that his units&#x27; commander gave them the freedom &quot;to do whatever their conscience and soul desires&quot;. The atrocities against the civilians had no limit, and were not sporadic, but were common and frequent in these areas. He adds the following about the state of the Turkish women and children: &quot;The voices and cries of women and children do not stop day and night. The entire forest, and especially the more hidden parts, are full of people and clothing. Every woman, every child, and every impossible place is at the disposal of every Greek soldier.[...]They met as they say, entire families, many women, beautiful and ugly. Some were crying, others were mourning their husband, their honor.&quot;&quot; The campaign ended with the burning of every inhabited area, sometimes together with the elderly inhabitants. However no allied witnesses were present in the interior. These events around Demirci were also mentioned in the reports and the memoirs of İbrahim Ethem Akıncı, the commander of the Turkish Irregular &quot;Demirci Akındjis&quot; units and the Kaymakam of Demirci dating to 22 May 1921. The severity of the atrocities are mentioned with the following words: &quot;A whole town was turned into ashes and many bad smells began to spread. [...] The streets could not be passed nor recognized. Many citizens lay martyred in every street. Some had only their feet, some had only one arm, some had only one head, and the other body parts had been burned black. Yarab (My God!), what is this view? [...] While we were wandering around, we came across even to some women who needed a witness to judge that they were human. They were raped by all the enemy soldiers and their feet and arms were broken, their whole bodies and faces were black, and they were sadly gone crazy. In the face of this tragedy, everyone (Akindjis) was sobbing and crying for revenge.&quot; The burning of the entirety of the town of Gördes by the Greek Occupation forces; 431 buildings, was also mentioned in the İsmet Paşa&#x27;s referendum and Venizelos&#x27; reply did not contain a contrary statement to this claim.

However, the Allied report concluded that the Ismid peninsula atrocities committed by the Turks &quot;have been considerable and more ferocious than those on the part of the Greeks&quot;. In general, as reported by a British intelligence report: &quot;the [Turkish] inhabitants of the occupied zone have, in most cases, accepted the advent of Greek rule without demur, and in some cases, undoubtedly prefer it to the [Turkish] Nationalist regime which seems to have been founded on terrorism&quot;. British military personnel observed that the Greek army near Uşak was warmly welcomed by the Muslim population for &quot;being freed from the license and oppression of the [Turkish] Nationalist troops&quot;; there were &quot;occasional cases of misconduct&quot; by the Greek troops against the Muslim population, and the perpetrators were prosecuted by the Greek authorities, while the &quot;worst miscreants&quot; were &quot;a handful of Armenians recruited by the Greek army&quot;, who were then sent back to Constantinople.

An eyewitness, a Greek Assistan Surgeon in the Greek Army, Petros Apostolidis from Ioannina who later became a prisoner of war in Uşak paint a completely different picture. In his memoirs he states that he will mention only 3 atrocities and will not mention the rest during the occupation with the following words: &quot;&quot;Old men, women and children were locked in the mosque. Some soldiers of ours took them (to other Greek soldiers) the news, but being cowards as all lowlifes are, they did not dare, because of the crowd, to breach the door of the mosque and enter to rape its women, they gathered dry straw, threw it through the windows and set it on fire. As the smoke suffocated them, people started to come out of the door then these rascals (Greek soldiers) put the innocent women and children in the shooting range and killed quite a few.&quot; [...]&quot;They (Greek soldiers) hammered large nails into the floor, tied the women&#x27;s braids to them to immobilize them, and gang-raped them.&quot;&quot; Moreover, he tells the story of a fellow doctor-officer Giannis Tzogias during their retreat, who did not stop two Greek soldiers from raping 2 Turkish girls out of fear nor shot nor reported them to their commander Trikoupis. The memoirs of Doctor Apostolidis regarding the state of Uşak and raping of Turkish girls are also verified in the official Ottoman documents from Uşak and from other Occupation zones. A report written by the Kaymakam of Balya, sent to the Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that Greek soldiers were raping girls even at the age of 10 and have done these rapings by locking the males of the villages (Aravacık, Hacı Hüseyin, Mancılık, Deliler and Haydaroba villages) in the mosques with the help of local Greeks who were informing the soldiers about the whereabouts of the beautiful girls and women. This report included the reports of the headmaster Mehmed Salih of the medrese of Uşak on his reports dating to 12th &amp; 28 May 1922. There the headmaster states that hundreds of women and children as well as 28 notables of Uşak were taken prisoners to Athens, many people were tortured by being burned while hanging upside down, civilians were used as trench diggers, graves were desecrated and heads of the corpses were taken and were being played with by the local Greeks and Armenian children. Headmaster also states that Greek soldiers consisting of 25 men raped a beautiful Muslim girl aged 14 in the village of İslamköy in front of her parents eyes and afterwards she died and her parent have been bayoneted and that immediately a commission composed of unaligned countries should be sent there to witness the atrocities. Also, Şükrü Nail Soysal, a member of Parti Pehlivan&#x27;s Platoon in his memoirs states that on 10 July 1921 his village, Ortaköy was looted and after being tortured, 40–50 males (including his brother Mehmet) were taken as prisoners and 30 were taken not to be seen again.

The behavior of Greek troops in Eastern Thrace was &quot;exemplary&quot;. According to an American witness, when the Greek army
marched into Bursa on July 8, the troops and Bursa Greeks displayed &quot;perfectly wonderful self-control&quot; toward the town&#x27;s Turkish inhabitants, &quot;especially when you think what they have to remember of wrongs done them and
their families&quot;. Aristeidis Stergiadis, the high commissioner of Smyrna, tried to ease ethnic violence in the region. Stergiadis immediately punished the Greek soldiers responsible for violence on with court martial and created a commission to decide on payment for victims (made up of representatives from Great Britain, France, Italy and other allies). Stergiadis took a strict stance against discrimination of the Turkish population and opposed church leaders and the local Greek population on a number of occasions. Historians disagree about whether this was a genuine stance against discrimination, or whether it was an attempt to present a positive vision of the occupation to the allies. This stance against discrimination of the Turkish population often pitted Stergiadis against some segments of the Greek army. He reportedly would carry a stick through the town with which he would beat Greeks that were being abusive of Turkish citizens. Troops would sometimes disobey his orders to not abuse the Turkish population, putting him in conflict with the military. Venizelos continued to support Stergiadis despite some opposition.

Justin McCarthy reports that during the negotiations for the Treaty of Lausanne, the chief negotiator of the Turkish delegation, Ismet Pasha (İnönü), gave an estimate of 1.5 million Anatolian Muslims that had either been exiled or died in the areas of the Greek occupation zone. McCarthy lowers the estimate to 1,246,068 Muslim population loss between 1914 and 1922 in Anatolia, and arbitrarily ascribes 640,000 of those as occurring in both the Greek and British zones of operation in 1919–1922. McCarthy&#x27;s work has faced harsh criticism by scholars who have characterized McCarthy&#x27;s views as indefensibly biased towards Turkey and the Turkish official position as well as engaging in genocide denial. Other scholars, such as R.J. Rummel and Micheal Clodfelter give considerably lower estimates, stating at least 15,000 Turkish civilian deaths, but declining to give a maximum estimate.

As part of the Lausanne Treaty, Greece recognized the obligation to pay reparations for damages caused in Anatolia, though Turkey agreed to renounce all such claims due to Greece&#x27;s difficult financial situation.

====Greek scorched-earth policy====

According to a number of sources, the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war. Historian of the Middle East, Sydney Nettleton Fisher wrote that: &quot;The Greek army in retreat pursued a burned-earth policy and committed every known outrage against defenceless Turkish villagers in its path.&quot; Norman M. Naimark noted that &quot;the Greek retreat was even more devastating for the local population than the occupation&quot;.

The Greek Army not only carried out a scorched-earth policy on its retreat, but also during its advance. This can be seen also in the diary of the Cretan Greek lieutenant Pantelis Priniotakis from Rethymno. In his diary dating to 13 July 1921, he states that his advancing unit, after a little resistance, captured and burned the town of Pazarcık in just a few hours, while some of its elder population were burned alive, while its population fled once they saw the advancing Greek Army.

The same lieutenant also states that the scorched-earth policy was conducted in the Greek Army&#x27;s retreat after the Battle of Sakarya in his diary dating to 17 September 1921. The retreating units of the Greek Army were burning the villages on its path while the civilian Turkish population, whose villages were being burned, could not dare to confront the Greek Army. He also states that the burning happened while the grain was still on the fields, and sums up the atrocities committed by his fellow soldiers with the following words: &quot;&quot;there was no lack of deviance and violence by our soldiers&quot; The severity of the war crimes committed by the retreating troops were also mentioned by another officer of the Greek Army in Anatolia, Panagiotis Demestichas, who in his memoirs he writes the following: &quot;The destruction in the cities and villages through which we passed, the arsons and other ugliness, I am not able to describe, and I prefer that the world remains oblivious to this destruction.&quot;&quot; Greek soldier Giannis Koutsonikolas explicitly stated that his units burned Afyonkarahisar and with it burned food, equipment and ammunition together with the city.

Colonel Stylianos Gonatas, states in his memoirs &quot;&quot;the rage of destruction and looting does not distinguish nationalities&quot;. He and his units were passing through Alaşehir while it was being burned from its one end to the other. While the city was being burned by the Greek Army, neither Turkish nor Greek quarters were spared from the burning. Moreover, he adds that the Greek Army looted both Greek houses, as well as Turkish ones. Gonatas also adds that every village in the plain east of Alaşehir was burned and that his troops could not find any living person nor anyone to take with them as a guide. He also states that Salihli and later Manisa was burned by the retreating Greeks while keeping the Turkish inhabitants inside the city. He also adds that the destruction of properties by the Greek Army included even the houses of the Greek soldiers from Turgutlu. He adds that those soldiers witnessed the burning of their own houses as well as the burning of the Turkish ones while the Turks were inside their burning houses &quot;shooting desperately&quot; killed a mounted retinue of the colonel. When Gonatas&#x27; units reached Urla, its local Greeks even formed a Militia unit to protect themselves from the retreating Greek Army and its civilian Greek and Irregular Armenian followers such as General Turkum&#x27;s unit and Gonatas states that this was &quot;a wise act of providence&quot;&quot; by the Greeks of Urla. Turkish military archives also state that Army Corps of General Frangkou, which Colonel Gonatas was under also continued burning the villages of Urla on their path including its Greek villages. During the Burning of Smyrna these units were burning Zeytinler village and its surrounding villages in the west of Urla.

Johannes Kolmodin was a Swedish orientalist in Smyrna. He wrote in his letters that the Greek army had burned 250 Turkish villages.

The Greek writer Elias Venezis, in his book Number 31328, states that Kırkağaç was burned from the Armenian quarter by the &quot;enemy&quot; who left; although this book is a memoir, in later versions the word &quot;enemy&quot; was changed to &quot;Greek&quot;. This claim is also verified in the Turkish Military archives. The units that have burned Kırkağaç continued its scorched earth policy and also burned Dikili on the night of 13–14 September while the Great Fire of Smyrna was ongoing. İsmet Paşa&#x27;s referendum during the Lausanne negotiations stated that 13,599 buildings in the Sanjak of Smyrna, outside the city center was burned by the Greek Army. Venizelos&#x27; reply does not have a contrary statement to this claim 

Greek soldier Vasilis Diamantopoulos, who in 1922 was stationed in Aydın and was captured when he and his units (18th Greek Infantry Regiment) reached the outskirts of İzmir on 10 September 1922, states that local Greeks and other Christians of Aydın started burning their own homes in the city before the official retreat, so that the Turks couldn&#x27;t find them intact. Moreover, he adds that the efforts of the Greek soldiers to put the fire down were in vain.

Kinross wrote, &quot;Already, most of the towns in its path were in ruins. One third of Ushak no longer existed. Alashehir was no more than a dark scorched cavity, defacing the hillside. Village after village had been reduced to an ash-heap. Out of the eighteen thousand buildings in the historic holy city of Manisa, only five hundred remained.&quot; The burning of Uşak is also mentioned in the military diary of Nikos Vasilikos, a Greek soldier and an enlisted student from the island of Thasos. He mentions the burning of the town and that all the surrounding villages were burned. He adds that the fire was so large that when they finished their march of &quot;twelve continuous hours&quot; and reached a village, the land was &quot;&quot;illuminated with wild splendor by the flames&quot;. Moreover, he states that the Greek Army was burning the entirety of the cities and towns, and that neither mosques nor churches were saved. When he reached Kasaba, he mentioned the following: &quot;We reach Kasaba, which is burning from end to end. The omnivorous fire licks with its fiery tongue indiscriminately the spiers of the Churches as well as the Minarets of the Mosques.&quot;&quot; According to the French diplomat Henry Franklin-Bouillon, during the fire of Manisa, out of 11,000 houses in the city, only 1,000 remained.

In one of the examples of the Greek atrocities during their Occupation, on 14 February 1922, in the Turkish village of Karatepe in Aydın Vilayeti, after being surrounded by the Greeks, all the inhabitants were put into the mosque, and the mosque was burned. The few who escaped the fire were shot. The Italian consul, M. Miazzi, reported that he had just visited a Turkish village where Greeks had slaughtered some sixty women and children. This report was then corroborated by Captain Kocher, the French consul.

====Scorched earth against livestock====
Greek scorched-earth policy also included mass slaughter of livestock. Stylianos Gonatas states that before embarking the ships in Çeşme on September 14–15, 1922, that the Greek Army ordered mass shooting of the horses and other animals and that this was the result of the egoistic recklessness of many men in the Greek Army. Moreover, the colonel states that this was done also by other units with the following words: &quot;&quot;the&quot; &quot;divisions of the 2nd Army Corps that preceded us had abandoned a thousand cattle, their thirsty eyes and the absence of running water wandering mournfully around the wells, hoping to be watered.&quot; Fahrettin Altay, the general of the 5th Cavalry Sidearmy which were in the pursuit of the retreating Greek forces (General Frangou/Southern Group) in the peninsula saw those animals on the morning of 16 September. He states the following for the condition of the animals and the peninsula: &quot;Greek soldiers escaping from Anatolia were able to escape as far as Çeşme with the horses they gathered from the villages. Their horses were also injured, bruised and skinny, some of them were scattered in the sea from hunger and thirst, and some of them were lying on the sand. Some of them were licking the damp stones on the dried fountain heads. Some of the poor animals were dead and some were about to die. We paused in the face of this heart-wrenching sight and collected and cared for those who could possibly be saved. We were also very saddened by the fact that the artillery carrier horses were killed by being tied to their feet with wires.&quot;&quot; Official documents from the Turkish military archives also state that around 500 battle animals were found dead and a thousand were saved and with all other animals from the peninsula were delivered to the animal depot near the Şirinyer Station by the 3rd Cavalry Division Ernest Hemingway who witnessed the Greek withdrawal from Edirne, Eastern Thrace after arriving to Constantinople on 30 September 1922 also states that the local Greek civilians were using a similar method of killing with the following words: &quot;The Greeks were nice chaps too. When they evacuated they had all their baggage animals they couldn&#x27;t take off with them so they just broke their forelegs and dumped them into the shallow water. All those mules with their forelegs broken pushed over into the shallow water. It was all a pleasant business. My word yes a most pleasant business.&quot; Greek soldiers such as Giannis Koutsonikolas from Arahova state that his units killed their own artillery animals when they were surrounded on all sides during the Great Offensive. On January 20, 1923, during Lausanne Negotiations, İsmet Paşa&#x27;s referendum about Greek devastations in Anatolia stated that 134,040 Horses, 63,926 Donkeys and Mules were killed or removed and the total amount of all animals including sheep, goats, cows, camels, oxen and buffaloes killed or removed were 3,291,335. This figure and the memorandum are only regarding animals in the Greek Occupation areas in Western Anatolia, the destruction of property and animals in Eastern Thrace is not included in this memorandum. Venizelos&#x27; reply on the same day did not include a contrary statement to the destruction of animals. The Greek Independent Division, also left in Dikili, 3000 sheep, 1000 horses, steers and mules and killed some animals which were found by the 2nd Turkish Cavalry and 14th Turkish Infantry Divisions.

===Population Exchange===

According to the population exchange treaty signed by both the Turkish and Greek governments, Greek orthodox citizens of Turkey and Turkish and Greek Muslim citizens residing in Greece were subjected to the population exchange between these two countries. Approximately 1,500,000 Orthodox Christians, being ethnic Greeks and ethnic Turks from Turkey and about 500,000 Turks and Greek Muslims from Greece were uprooted from their homelands. M. Norman Naimark claimed that this treaty was the last part of an ethnic cleansing campaign to create an ethnically pure homeland for the Turks Historian Dinah Shelton similarly wrote that &quot;the Lausanne Treaty completed the forcible transfer of the country&#x27;s Greeks.&quot;

A large part of the Greek population was forced to leave their ancestral homelands of Ionia, Pontus and Eastern Thrace between 1914 and 1922. These refugees, as well as Greek Americans with origins in Anatolia, were not allowed to return to their homelands after the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne.

<text>Hunt Club Road, also known as [[List of numbered roads in Ottawa|Ottawa Road 32]], is a major east–west route in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It originally ran from a dead end east of Bank Street (Ottawa Road 31, formerly Ontario Highway 31) to the Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club; later, there were many extensions due to the 1970s housing boom, first westward to Riverside Drive, then eastward to Hawthorne Road in the late 1980s. The section between Bank Street and Riverside Drive, originally only one lane in each direction, was expanded to two lanes in each direction in 1993–1994. It was further extended across the Rideau River and the southern edge of the suburbs to Richmond Road by the late 1990s; this extension is signed as West Hunt Club Road by the City of Ottawa. Construction to extend Hunt Club eastward to Highway 417 near Ramsayville was completed on August 21, 2014.

Most of Hunt Club Road is a four-lane divided principal arterial road with limited access, particularly between just west of Merivale Road and Highway 416 where it is an at-grade urban expressway. The section east of Merivale, originally a tank farm, has transformed into a major big-box retail area.

The speed limit on most sections is except in the South Keys area, where it is .

The Michael J.E. Sheflin Bridge, better known as the Hunt Club Bridge, carries the road over the Rideau River between Prince of Wales Drive (former Highway 16) and Riverside Drive. The bridge was widened over the summer of 2006, extending the left turn lanes in both directions over the full length of the bridge to alleviate congestion.

The City&#x27;s Transportation Master Plan includes the widening of the road to six lanes between Highway 416 and Bank Street.

Along the road, one may find Pine Grove Park, and the Stoney Swamp Conservation Area.

<doc id="500654" wikidata="Q5156808" url="?curid=500654" title="Compositional data">
<text>In statistics, compositional data are quantitative descriptions of the parts of some whole, conveying relative information. Mathematically, compositional data is represented by points on a simplex. Measurements involving probabilities, proportions, percentages, and ppm can all be thought of as compositional data.

==Ternary plot==
Compositional data in three variables can be plotted via ternary plots. The use of a barycentric plot on three variables graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an equilateral triangle.

==Simplicial sample space==
In general, John Aitchison defined compositional data to be proportions of some whole in 1982. In particular, a compositional data point (or &quot;composition&quot; for short) can be represented by a real vector with positive components. The sample space of compositional data is a simplex:
:: formula_1
The only information is given by the ratios between components, so the information of a composition is preserved under multiplication by any positive constant. Therefore, the sample space of compositional data can always be assumed to be a standard simplex, i.e. formula_2. In this context, normalization to the standard simplex is called closure and is denoted by formula_3:

:: formula_4

where &quot;D&quot; is the number of parts (components) and formula_5 denotes a row vector.

== Aitchison geometry ==
The simplex can be given the structure of a vector space in several different ways. The following vector space structure is called Aitchison geometry or the Aitchison simplex and has the following operations:

; Perturbation (vector addition)

:: formula_6

; Powering (scalar multiplication)

:: formula_7

; Inner product

:: formula_8

Endowed with those operations, the Aitchison simplex forms a formula_9-dimensional Euclidean inner product space. The uniform composition formula_10 is the zero vector.

=== Orthonormal bases ===
Since the Aitchison simplex forms a finite dimensional Hilbert space, it is possible to construct orthonormal bases in the simplex. Every composition formula_11 can be decomposed as follows

:: formula_12

where formula_13 forms an orthonormal basis in the simplex. The values formula_14 are the (orthonormal and Cartesian) coordinates of formula_11 with respect to the given basis. They are called isometric log-ratio coordinates formula_16.

=== Linear transformations ===
There are three well-characterized isomorphisms that transform from the Aitchison simplex to real space. All of these transforms satisfy linearity and as given below

==== Additive log ratio transform ====
The additive log ratio (alr) transform is an isomorphism where formula_17. This is given by

:: formula_18

The choice of denominator component is arbitrary, and could be any specified component.
This transform is commonly used in chemistry with measurements such as pH. In addition, this is the transform most commonly used for multinomial logistic regression. The alr transform is not an isometry, meaning that distances on transformed values will not be equivalent to distances on the original compositions in the simplex.

==== Center log ratio transform ====
The center log ratio (clr) transform is both an isomorphism and an isometry where formula_19

:: formula_20

Where formula_21 is the geometric mean of formula_22. The inverse of this function is also known as the softmax function.

==== Isometric logratio transform ====
The isometric log ratio (ilr) transform is both an isomorphism and an isometry where formula_23

:: formula_24

There are multiple ways to construct orthonormal bases, including using the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization or singular-value decomposition of clr transformed data. 
Another alternative is to construct log contrasts from a bifurcating tree. If we are given a bifurcating tree, we can construct a basis from the internal nodes in the tree.

Each vector in the basis would be determined as follows

:: formula_25

The elements within each vector are given as follows

:: formula_26

where formula_27 are the respective number of tips in the corresponding subtrees shown in the figure. It can be shown that the resulting basis is orthonormal

Once the basis formula_28 is built, the ilr transform can be calculated as follows

:: formula_29

where each element in the ilr transformed data is of the following form

:: formula_30

where formula_31 and formula_32 are the set of values corresponding to the tips in the subtrees formula_33 and formula_34

==Examples==
* In chemistry, compositions can be expressed as molar concentrations of each component. As the sum of all concentrations is not determined, the whole composition of &quot;D&quot; parts is needed and thus expressed as a vector of &quot;D&quot; molar concentrations. These compositions can be translated into weight per cent multiplying each component by the appropriated constant.
* In demography, a town may be a compositional data point in a sample of towns; a town in which 35% of the people are Christians, 55% are Muslims, 6% are Jews, and the remaining 4% are others would correspond to the quadruple [0.35, 0.55, 0.06, 0.04]. A data set would correspond to a list of towns.
* In geology, a rock composed of different minerals may be a compositional data point in a sample of rocks; a rock of which 10% is the first mineral, 30% is the second, and the remaining 60% is the third would correspond to the triple [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]. A data set would contain one such triple for each rock in a sample of rocks.
* In high throughput sequencing, data obtained are typically transformed to relative abundances, rendering them compositional. 
* In probability and statistics, a partition of the sampling space into disjoint events is described by the probabilities assigned to such events. The vector of &quot;D&quot; probabilities can be considered as a composition of &quot;D&quot; parts. As they add to one, one probability can be suppressed and the composition is completely determined.
* In chemometrics, for the classification of petroleum oils.
* In a survey, the proportions of people positively answering some different items can be expressed as percentages. As the total amount is identified as 100, the compositional vector of &quot;D&quot; components can be defined using only &quot;D&quot; − 1 components, assuming that the remaining component is the percentage needed for the whole vector to add to 100.

<text>Airport Parkway ([[List of numbered roads in Ottawa|Ottawa Route 79]]) is a parkway and two-lane expressway in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It runs from the Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport to an interchange with Heron Road where it turns into Bronson Avenue.

==Route description==
Airport Parkway is a two-lane expressway for most of its length, although since bicycles are permitted, it is not considered a controlled-access highway. It is home to one of Ontario&#x27;s only two single-point urban interchanges at its Hunt Club Road exit. The speed limit is for its entire length.

Airport Parkway begins after leaving the airport, where it immediately interchanges with Lester Road. The Parkway turns northwards and traverses through some forest before encountering Hunt Club Road, which it interchanges it with an SPUI, one of only a handful in Canada. After that, the Parkway passes under a pedestrian overpass and runs parallel to the Transitway. The Parkway then meets Walkley Road with a partial interchange. After that, it is flanked by residential neighbourhoods before interchanging with Brookfield Road, and the Parkway ends shortly after as it interchanges with Heron Road. The Parkway continues as Bronson Avenue and loses its expressway status. 

==History==
Until 1997, Airport Parkway was maintained by the federal government of Canada under the jurisdiction of the National Capital Commission.

=== Juno Beach Memorial Bridge ===
The Juno Beach Memorial Bridge is a footbridge spanning the Airport Parkway just north of Hunt Club Road. It is an important link connecting communities west of the Parkway to the South Keys Shopping Centre and the South Keys bus station. Construction of the Juno Beach Memorial Bridge began in June 2011. After multiple delays due to material and design flaws, the bridge opened 3 years behind schedule and $5.5 million over budget in November 2014. It was officially named in November 2019.

==Future==
The road has had 300 collisions and three fatalities since 2000, making it the focus of future improvements. There has been some discussing in twinning it to a four-lane expressway or freeway, although those discussions have stalled due to local controversy.

==Exit list==

The following is a list of exits along Airport Parkway. Some exits on Bronson Avenue are also included.

<text>Timothy Murphy ( – ) was an American soldier who fought during the Revolutionary War. In the Saratoga campaign, Murphy is reputed to have shot and killed British Army officers Sir Francis Clerke and Simon Fraser. Murphy&#x27;s life is the subject of a 1953 novel titled &quot;The Rifleman&quot;.

==Early life==
Relatively few details of Murphy&#x27;s early life are known. He was born in the year 1751 near the Delaware Water Gap. His parents were Presbyterians from County Donegal, Ireland who moved to Shamokin Flats (now Sunbury, Pennsylvania) in 1759, when Murphy was eight years old. A few years later, Murphy became an apprentice to a Mr Van Campen and moved with the van Campen family to the Wyoming Valley, which was then the frontier.

==American Revolutionary War==
On June 29, 1775, shortly after the start of the American Revolutionary War, Timothy Murphy and his brother John enlisted in the Northumberland County Riflemen, specifically Captain John Lowdon&#x27;s Company. Their unit saw action in the Siege of Boston, the Battle of Long Island, and &quot;skirmishing in Westchester&quot;. After this, Murphy was promoted to the rank of sergeant in the Continental Army&#x27;s 12th Pennsylvania Regiment and fought at the battles of Trenton and Princeton. Murphy was an &quot;expert marksman&quot;, defined as being &quot;able to hit a seven-inch target at 250 yards&quot;. In July 1777, this skill led to Murphy joining Daniel Morgan&#x27;s newly formed Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen.

Later that year, he was selected as one of 500 handpicked riflemen to go with General Daniel Morgan to Upstate New York to help stop General John Burgoyne and the British Army. As the battles around Saratoga raged, the British, having been pushed back, were being rallied by Brigadier-General Simon Fraser. Benedict Arnold rode up to General Morgan, pointed at Fraser and told Morgan the man was worth a regiment. Morgan called on Murphy and said, &quot;That gallant officer is General Fraser. I admire him, but it is necessary that he should die, do your duty.&quot; Murphy scaled a nearby tree, took careful aim at the extreme distance of 300 yards, and fired three times. The first shot was a close miss, the second grazed the general&#x27;s horse, and with the third, Fraser tumbled from his horse, shot through the stomach. General Fraser died that night. British senior officer Sir Francis Clerke, General Burgoyne&#x27;s chief aide-de-camp, galloped onto the field with a message. Murphy&#x27;s third shot killed him instantly.Murphy also fought at the battle of the Middle Fort in 1780.

Murphy&#x27;s 1839 biography &quot;Life and Adventures of Timothy Murphy&quot; by Mr. Sigsby, reveals that Murphy &quot;Sometimes habited in the dress of the Indian, with his face painted, he would pass among them, making important discoveries as to their strength and designs without detection.&quot; Sigsby also relates some of Murphy&#x27;s infamous brutality against First Nations people: &quot;The Indian was very large and powerful and Murphy being exceedingly angry, skinned his legs and drew it over his long stockings. ... But the skin of the Indian having shrunk, began to gall his legs, whereupon he took his hunting knife and ripped them off.&quot;

==Family==
Murphy&#x27;s first wife, Peggy (née Margaret Feeck), was the daughter of Johannes Feeck, a prosperous Dutch-American farmer in the valley. Timothy and Margaret Murphy had five sons and four daughters. Several years after the 1807 death of his first wife, Murphy married Mary Robertson, and relocated to Charlotteville, New York, and thereby she had four more sons.

==Interment==
The bronze bas-relief plaque on Murphy&#x27;s grave at Upper Middleburgh Cemetery, Middleburgh, New York was designed by sculptor Evelyn Beatrice Longman (1874–1954).

<text>Fort St. John is a city located in northeastern British Columbia, Canada. The most populous municipality in the Peace River Regional District, the city encompasses a total area of about with 21,465 residents recorded in the 2021 Census. Located at Mile 47 of the Alaska Highway, it is one of the largest cities between Dawson Creek, British Columbia and Delta Junction, Alaska. Established in 1794 as a trading post, Fort St. John is the oldest European-established settlement in present-day British Columbia. The city is served by the Fort St. John Airport. The municipal slogan is &quot;Fort St. John: The Energetic City.&quot;

==History==
Over the 19th and 20th centuries, the community has been moved a number of times for varying economic reasons. The present location is thought to be its sixth. The original trading post built in the area was named Rocky Mountain House (not to be confused with the modern Alberta town by that name). It was established one year after Sir Alexander Mackenzie explored the area in 1793. One of a series of forts along the Peace River constructed to service the fur trade, it was located southwest of the present site of Fort St. John. The Dane-zaa and Sikanni First Nations used it as a trading post. It was also used as a supply depot for further expeditions into the territory. The fort closed in 1805. Fort d&#x27;Epinette was built in 1806 by the North West Company. It was renamed Fort St. John in 1821 following the purchase of the North West Company by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. This fort was located about downstream from the mouth of the Beatton River, which at that time was known as the Pine River. It was shut down in 1823. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1958.

After a lapse of nearly forty years, Fort St. John was reopened in 1860 on the south side of the Peace River, directly south of the present community. It was moved in 1872 by Francis Work Beatton directly across the river. This community lasted until 1925 when the river ceased to be the main avenue of transportation and the fort was moved closer to where settlers were establishing homesteads. The new town was constructed at Fish Creek, northwest of the present community, on the new trail to Fort Nelson. It did not shut down until 1975. In 1928, C. M. Finch moved his general store to two quarters of land where he also built a government building to house the land, telegraph and post offices. The present site for the town was firmly established after he donated for a Roman Catholic church and additional land for a hospital.

The first census that recognized Fort St. John as a census subdivision took place in 1951 and recorded 884 people. The population rapidly increased, doubling almost every 5 years for 15 years so that by 1966 there were 6,749 residents living in the community.

==Geography==
Fort St. John is geographically on the western edge of the Canadian prairies that cover much of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, but is not politically included in the three Canadian Prairie provinces. The city sits between the Peace River and Beatton River, with Charlie Lake nearby.

Sitting at an elevation of , Fort St. John is situated within a low-lying valley near the eastern foothills of the Muskwa Ranges and Hart Ranges of the Northern Rockies. Prairies lie to the east and north, while to the west the Rocky Mountains form a rain shadow. The city is built on relatively flat, rolling hills.

Fort St. John, along with neighboring cities of Chetwynd, Tumbler Ridge, and Dawson Creek, are within Peace River Country, a large geographic area of British Columbia and Alberta. The Peace River valley provides opportunities for farming, in contrast to the rugged mountains to the west.

===Climate===
Fort St. John experiences a cold humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) closely bordering on a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), with cold winters and warm summers. Although winters can be frigid, the area has milder winters than much of the rest of Canada (especially considering its northerly latitude) due to the influence of the nearby Rocky Mountains. They tend to block arctic air masses coming in from the north/northwest, although they can certainly still penetrate the area. A predominantly southwesterly wind blows through town, with wind speeds averaging around . Fort St. John uses Mountain Standard Time all year (same as Pacific Daylight Time in summer), and because of its northerly latitude experiences short daylight hours in winter and long daylight hours in summer.

Fort St. John is east of the Rocky Mountains, and thus has a climate much more similar to the prairies than the British Columbia interior west of the mountains. The frost-free period is much longer east of the mountains than west, and thus the Peace River area including Fort St. John can grow crops that cannot be grown in most of the province such as wheat and canola.

Fort St. John is one of the sunniest places in the province, especially in the winter and spring. The city holds British Columbia&#x27;s record for most sunshine ever recorded in March (247.4 hours in 1965), May (373.5 hours in 1972), and November (141.3 hours in 1976).

The highest temperature ever recorded in Fort St. John was on 16 July 1941. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 11 January 1911.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Fort St. John had a population of 21,465 living in 8,777 of its 10,004 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 20,260. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===
=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Fort St. John included:
*Irreligion (12,170 persons or 57.5%)
*Christianity (7,685 persons or 36.3%)
*Sikhism (490 persons or 2.3%)
*Hinduism (290 persons or 1.4%)
*Islam (250 persons or 1.2%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (60 persons or 0.3%)
*Buddhism (50 persons or 0.2%)
*Judaism (20 persons or 0.1%)

==Economy==
As the urban centre for a rural and farming population of about 8,306 people and home to 18,609 people, Fort St. John is a retail, service and industrial centre. The province&#x27;s oil and gas industry, including the provincial Oil and Gas Commission is centred in the city. Forestry has become more important to the city since the opening of an oriented strand board plant in 2005. Much wood is exported to the United States.

Fort St. John is a transportation hub and industrial centre serving BC Hydro&#x27;s nearby hydro-electric facilities, the W.A.C. Bennett Dam, Peace Canyon Dam and Site C dam.

The 2001 Canadian census recorded 9,985 income-earners over the age of 15 residing in Fort St. John; of these, 4,500 worked full-time throughout the year. The high participation rate stems from the relatively young population, much of which was attracted by the area&#x27;s high-paying oil and gas industry. Its male-female income gap is large.

==Health care==
Fort St. John has a hospital, which as of 2022, had 44 in patient beds, 4 intensive care unit beds, and 7 delivery beds. It has a CT scanner and ultrasound.

==Arts and culture==

As the urban centre for approximately 20,000 people, much of the region&#x27;s recreational and cultural facilities are located in town. Within the city, Centennial Park groups much of these facilities in a central location close to residences and businesses. This large park includes the Fort St. John North Peace Museum, the North Peace Leisure Pool, the North Peace Arena (home of the Fort St. John Huskies), a separate arena for children, an 8-sheet curling rink, as well as an outdoor water park and speed skating oval. Other parks in the area include the city-maintained Fish Creek Community Forest, and about northwest of town the Beatton Provincial Park and Charlie Lake Provincial Park. In the centre of town is the North Peace Cultural Centre which houses the Fort St. John Public Library, a theatre, and the Peace Gallery North art gallery. 

==Attractions==
The city&#x27;s main recreation centre is the Fort St. John Enerplex, also known as the Pomeroy Sport Centre, that opened in 2010. It is a three-storey public facility with two National Hockey League-sized ice rinks, a concession, 12 dressing rooms, public meeting rooms, a retail juice outlet, an indoor near-Olympic-sized long track speed skating oval, and a 340 meter long walking track (the &quot;Northern Vac Track&quot;). All ice surfaces can be removed to provide event space in excess of 140,000 square feet. The facility also houses the Energetic Learning Campus, a satellite campus of the nearby North Peace Secondary School.

Fort St. John hosted the BC Winter Games in 1984 and the Northern BC Winter Games in 1975, 1976, 1994, 2000, and 2007. Every August, the Great Canadian Welding Competition is held in Fort St. John, which sees welding artists fill Centennial Park creating statues on the year&#x27;s given theme. In January the annual High on Ice Winter Carnival has a frozen Centennial Park filled with ice sculptors competing and other special winter-related activities occurring around town.

==Government==
The City of Fort St. John has a council-manager form of municipal government. A six-member council, along with one mayor, is elected at-large every three years. In the November 19, 2011 civic election Lori Ackerman was elected mayor, replacing the former newspaper publisher Bruce Lantz who served as mayor between 2008 and 2011. In the 2008 election Lantz had defeated one term mayor and former RCMP officer Jim Eglinski who had defeated the incumbent mayor of 15 years, Steve Thorlakson in 2005. The mayor and one city councillor represent Fort St. John on the board of directors of the Peace River Regional District. Seven board of education trustees, for representation on School District 60 Peace River North, are also elected by the city.

Fort St. John is situated in the Peace River North provincial electoral district and is represented by Pat Pimm in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Pimm replaced long-time MLA Richard Neufeld who was first elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 1991 provincial election with the BC Social Credit Party taking 56% of votes cast at the Fort St. John polls and re-elected with Reform BC in 1996 with 44% support, and with the BC Liberal Party in 2001 and 2005 with 73% and 59% of Fort St. John polls, respectively. He has served as the Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources since 2001.

Federally, Fort St. John is located in the Prince George—Peace River riding, which is represented in the House of Commons by Conservative Party Member of Parliament Bob Zimmer, a former high school teacher who lives in Fort St. John. Prior to Zimmer, the riding had been represented by long-time MP Jay Hill, who was born and raised in Fort St. John, and first elected in 1993 and subsequently re-elected in 1997, 2000, and 2004 with 74%, 77%, and 70% support from Fort St. John polls, respectively. Hill was also re-elected in the 2006 and 2008 federal elections. Hill had served as the Government House Leader and was formerly the Secretary of State and Chief Government Whip, as well as the Whip of the Canadian Alliance Party. Before Hill the riding was represented, from 1972 to 1993, by Frank Oberle of the Progressive Conservative Party who served as Minister of State for Science and Technology from 1985 to 1989 and Minister of Forestry from 1990 to 1993.

=== Police ===

Police protection is contracted to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which operates a 26 officer municipal detachment and a 10-member rural detachment from the city. In 2005, the municipal detachment reported &quot;Criminal Code&quot; offences, which translates into a crime rate of 228 offences per 1,000 people, much higher than the provincial average of 125 offences. During that year, compared to the provincial average, the RCMP reported much higher crime rates in Fort St. John for cocaine, cannabis, non-sexual assaults, property damage, and arson related offences. However, the city had lower crime rates for robbery, theft from motor vehicles, and business break-and-enters.

==Infrastructure==

Fort St. John is the transportation hub of the region. The main highway, Highway 97 (Alaska Highway), built in 1942 by the United States Army, runs through the city, north to Fort Nelson, the Yukon, and Alaska. As the highway goes over the Peace River to Dawson Creek, it reduced the community&#x27;s dependence on the river for transportation. Within the city the streets are laid out in a grid pattern. The main streets are the north–south 100 Street and the east–west 100 Avenue. The rail line that runs by the eastern and northern borders was extended from Chetwynd by the Pacific Great Eastern Railway with the first train arriving in 1958. The only commercial airport between Dawson Creek and Fort Nelson is the Fort St. John Airport (CYXJ) located a few miles east of the city. The two runway airport has Air Canada Jazz, WestJet and other smaller airlines such as Central Mountain Air and Swanberg Air with regularly scheduled flights and North Cariboo Air providing chartered flights. Greyhound Bus lines, which had a bus stop in the city, operated a route along the highway, north to Whitehorse (via Fort Nelson) and south to Dawson Creek, until the company stopped operations in Western Canada in 2018. BC Bus North provides bus service to Dawson Creek, Prince George, and Fort Nelson.

The city&#x27;s water and sewer infrastructure pumps water from 4 deep wells located near the Peace River with a backup source being Charlie Lake; it is filtered, chlorinated and fluoridated before being distributed. The water has been rated by the BC Ministry of Environment as being &quot;Very hard.&quot; Sewage is processed in one of two lagoons. The lagoon south of the city releases the processed effluent into the Peace River and the lagoon north of the city releases into the Beatton River. Storm sewers run with the sanitary sewers but storm discharge is directed into the rivers without going through the lagoons. The city&#x27;s fire department consists of volunteer and professional members, covering the city plus five miles (8 km) into the rural areas.

==Education==
There are 9 public schools within the city limits, with one being a secondary school, and another 10 outside of Fort St. John that are all administered by School District 60 Peace River North. There is one private Christian school in Fort St. John, also administered by School District 60 Peace River North. Northern Lights College has a campus in Fort St. John housing the B.C. Centre of Training Excellence in Oil and Gas, which includes a full-sized oil rig and simulated well site. The 2001 Census estimated that 10% of people in Fort St. John between 20 and 64 years old graduated from a university, less than half of the 24% provincial average and 27% did not graduate from secondary school, 7% higher than the provincial average.

==Media==
The &quot;Alaska Highway News&quot; and &quot;The Northerner&quot; are published in Fort St. John. A local free magazine known as &quot;Northern Groove&quot; focuses on local music, arts, and live entertainment events in Fort St. John and area and is published monthly. The EnergeticCity.ca website is a digital news outlet focused on local news in and around Fort St. John; it is owned by 0914126 B.C. Ltd., which is controlled 100% by Adam Reaburn, owner of local radio station CKFU-FM.

Radio stations broadcasting from Fort St. John include Move! 98.5 FM (CHRX-FM) (Variety), Bounce 101.5 FM (CKNL-FM) (Oldies), 92.5 Sunrise FM (CIAM-FM) (Religious) and the aforementioned country music station 100.1 Moose FM (CKFU-FM).

He moved to Bundesliga side Bochum in January 2008 but made limited appearances due to injuries. He signed for Shimizu S-Pulse in January 2010. He subsequently played for Western Sydney Wanderers, Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo and Ryukyu before retiring in 2023.

He earned 56 caps for the Japan national team. He was part of the squads for the 1998, 2002 and 2006 World Cups.

==Career==
===Urawa Reds===
Ono grew up in the Shizuoka Prefecture and began his professional career with Urawa Reds in the J1 League in 1998. The same year, he became the youngest Japanese player to play at 1998 World Cup, at age 18. He caught the attention of foreign clubs with his performance at the 1999 World Youth Championship in Nigeria, where he captained the Japanese Under-20 side that reached the final. But later that year, he suffered a severe knee injury in a qualification match for the 2000 Olympics with Japan&#x27;s Under-23 side, forcing him to miss the rest of the season and Olympic qualifying.

===Feyenoord===
After a strong performance at the 2001 Confederations Cup, Ono moved to Feyenoord of the Dutch Eredivisie in 2001. In his first season, he helped Feyenoord win the 2002 UEFA Cup, making him the first Japanese in history to win a European trophy. However, a string of injuries kept him sidelined for long periods. After he missed the majority of 2004–05, the club sold him. His stint at the Rotterdam based club is highly rated and Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder said &quot;Shinji Ono is the toughest opponent I&#x27;ve ever faced&quot;.

===Urawa Reds return===
On 13 January 2006, Ono returned to the J1 League, signing a three-year deal with his former club Urawa Reds.

===Bochum===
In the 2008 January transfer window, Ono returned to Europe, signing with Bundesliga&#x27;s Bochum. On 3 February 2008, Ono made his Bundesliga debut in an away game against Werder Bremen, and he had two assists that helped Bochum with their first ever win over Bremen at Weserstadion. Ono suffered injuries in the following two years in Bochum, and could only play 34 matches in which he gave four assists for the club. In the winter break of 2009–10, Ono requested a return to Japan for personal reasons. Different Japanese clubs were interested in the midfielder. Bochum allowed him to leave under the condition that they could find a successor.

===Shimizu S-Pulse===

On 9 January 2010, Ono returned to his native Shizuoka Prefecture by signing for Shimizu S-Pulse. The transfer fee were rumored to be €300,000 for the midfielder whose contract in Bochum expired in the summer of 2010. In an interview he declared that the main reason for his transfer was his wish to reunite with his wife and children, who were still living in Japan.

===Western Sydney Wanderers===
On 28 September 2012, it was announced that Shinji Ono had signed with new A-League club Western Sydney Wanderers on a two-year deal as the club&#x27;s marquee player. The Wanderers were offered former German international Michael Ballack but preferred to sign Ono. He made his debut for the Wanderers on 6 October, in a scoreless draw against Central Coast Mariners, in the first game of the season.

Ono scored his first goal for the club with a penalty in round 10 against Brisbane Roar. Ono scored two stunning goals to help the Wanderers beat Melbourne Victory 2–1 in round 14 on 1 January 2013. On 16 January 2014, the club announced that Ono would return to Japan at the end of the A-League season. Ono will link up with J2 League club Consadole Sapporo to play out the remainder of the season in Japan as the club chases promotion to the J1 League. On 4 May 2014, Ono played his last A-League game for the Wanderers, in a 2–1 Grand Final loss to Brisbane Roar, in what was to be the Wanderers&#x27; second successive Grand Final defeat.

===Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo===
Following the expiration of his contract and his desire to see his family, Ono joined Consadole Sapporo (later &quot;Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo&quot;) in May 2014.

===FC Ryukyu===
On 5 August 2019, Ono signed with J2 League club FC Ryukyu. In December 2020, he left Ryuku after failing to reach a contract extension agreement.

===Return to Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo===
On 1 January 2021, it was announced that he would return to his former club, Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo, as a permanent transfer. His uniform number is 44, the same as when he belonged to Sapporo last time.

On 9 June of the same year, in the second round of the Emperor&#x27;s Cup at Sony Sendai, he scored his first goal in an official match in four years with a direct free kick. This goal made him the oldest player to score in the Emperor&#x27;s Cup (41 years and 255 days old).

On 28 January 2022, it was announced that he had signed a lifetime contract with Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo. Ono commented, &quot;I consider Hokkaido to be my second home. I don&#x27;t know how I will end my active career, but I hope to continue to give back to the club by sharing my experiences&quot;. In addition, Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo representative director and GM Daikatsu Mikami expressed his intention to prioritize Ono&#x27;s wishes, saying, &quot;I will let him decide whether he wants to be a coach or join the front desk&quot;.

On 27 September 2023, the day he celebrated his 44th birthday, which is the same as his jersey number, he posted on his Instagram a message posted on the Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo official website: &quot;I have a report to share with you all. 39th anniversary of my first encounter with soccer. My feet, which have been my companions for many years, are telling me it&#x27;s time to give them a rest, so I&#x27;ve decided to end my career as a professional soccer player at the end of this season. There are still a few games left in the season. However, I will continue to prepare as well as possible so that I can be involved in the game as much as possible. I ask for your support until the end&quot;. Shinji Ono announced that he will retire as an active player after the 2023 season.

On 3 December 2023, at the 2023 J1 league season final round, Ono played his last professional game against Urawa. He said goodbye to his colleague and every fan.

==International career==
When fit, Ono was an ever-present member of the Japan national team. He made his full international debut on 1 April 1998 against South Korea in a friendly. After his appearance in the 1998 World Cup, he was a key member of the Japanese squad in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He has represented Japan at every age level starting with the U-16 team, and was one of three overage selections at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Injuries limited Ono to just one appearance in the final round of the qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and missed the Confederations Cup in 2003 and 2005. He played in his third World Cup finals in Germany.

==Style of play==
Known as &quot;Tensai&quot; (天才, Japanese for &quot;Genius&quot;), Ono is one of the biggest stars in Asian football, known for his vision, technique and superb passing. Although his primary position is attacking midfielder, he can play anywhere in the midfield, including defensive midfield and either wing.

<text>Riverside Drive ([[List of numbered routes in Ottawa|Ottawa Road]] #19) is a major road in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, that follows along the eastern bank of the Rideau River. Its northern terminus is at the Transitway/Via Rail underpass just south of the Queensway, and the road proceeds south to Limebank Road where it continues as River Road until the city limits. North of the Queensway, Riverside continues as Vanier Parkway, which travels through Vanier until Beechwood Avenue. The Vanier Parkway name is linked to the neighbourhood of Vanier, which was named for former Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier.

Most of the road is a four-lane divided principal arterial, with a speed limit of , although the general flow is faster in many sections.

Riverside is home to the Riverside Hospital, the Billings Bridge Plaza, the RA Centre, Canada Post headquarters, Public Works Canada headquarters, Canadian Labour Congress headquarters, Vincent Massey Park, Terry Fox Athletic Facility, and Mooney&#x27;s Bay Park.

Riverside originally began at Montreal Road, but the area between Montreal Road and Hurdman&#x27;s Bridge was renamed River Road (now River Road North) in 1960. Riverside was re-aligned between Smyth Road and Industrial Avenue in 1986. Riverside once ended at Industrial, while it was Alta Vista Drive that carried traffic across the Queensway to become the Vanier Parkway. The old alignment of Riverside Drive in Riverview continued to be known as Riverside Drive, serving a number of apartment building complexes, and has a cul-de-sac at each end. It would later be bifurcated by the Hospital Link Road, and its northern section was renamed Lycée Place, and its southern section renamed Frobisher Lane.

==Limebank Road==

Limebank Road is an arterial road in Ottawa, which is a southbound continuation of Riverside Drive that starts at River Road, and continues south through Riverside South and to Mitch Owens Rd. It continues southbound through West Greely as Dozois Road.

<doc id="500700" wikidata="Q505154" url="?curid=500700" title="Jeremy Rifkin">
<text>Jeremy Rifkin (born January 26, 1945) is an American economic and social theorist, writer, public speaker, political advisor, and activist. Rifkin is the author of 23 books about the influence of scientific and technological changes on the economy, the workforce, society, and the environment. His most recent books include &quot;The Age of Resilience&quot; (2022), &quot;The Green New Deal&quot; (2019), &quot;The Zero Marginal Cost Society&quot; (2014), &quot;The Third Industrial Revolution&quot; (2011), &quot;The Empathic Civilization&quot; (2010), and &quot;The European Dream&quot; (2004).

Rifkin is the principal architect of the &quot;Third Industrial Revolution&quot; long-term economic sustainability plan to address the triple challenge of the global economic crisis, energy security, and climate change. The Third Industrial Revolution (TIR) was formally endorsed by the European Parliament in 2007.

&quot;The Huffington Post&quot; reported from Beijing in October 2015 that &quot;Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has not only read Jeremy Rifkin&#x27;s book, &quot;The Third Industrial Revolution&quot;, but taken it to heart&quot;, he and his colleagues having incorporated ideas from this book into the core of the country&#x27;s thirteenth Five-Year Plan. According to EurActiv, &quot;Jeremy Rifkin is an American economist and author whose best-selling &quot;Third Industrial Revolution&quot; arguably provided the blueprint for Germany&#x27;s transition to a low-carbon economy, and China&#x27;s strategic acceptance of climate policy.&quot;

Rifkin has taught at the Wharton School executive education program at the University of Pennsylvania since 1995, where he instructs CEOs and senior management on making a transition of their business operations into sustainable economies. Rifkin is ranked number 123 in the &quot;WorldPost&quot; / &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; 2015 global survey of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Influential Voices&quot;. He also is listed among the top ten most influential economic thinkers in the survey. Rifkin has lectured before many &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies, and hundreds of governments, civil society organizations, and universities over the past thirty five years.

== Biography ==

===Youth and education===
Rifkin was born in Denver, Colorado, to Vivette Ravel Rifkin and Milton Rifkin, a plastic-bag manufacturer. He grew up on the southwest side of Chicago. He was president of the graduating class of 1967 at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor of science degree in economics at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce. Rifkin was also the recipient of the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s General Alumni Association&#x27;s Award of Merit 1967.

Rifkin was an active member of the peace movement. He attended the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University (MA, International Affairs, 1968) where he continued anti-war activities. Later he joined Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA).

===1970s===
In 1970, Rifkin founded the People&#x27;s Bicentennial Commission to provide &quot;revolutionary alternatives for the Bicentennial years.&quot;

In 1973, Rifkin organized a mass protest against oil companies at the commemoration of the 200th Anniversary of the Boston Tea Party at Boston Harbor. Thousands joined the protest, as activists dumped empty oil barrels into Boston Harbor. The protest came in the wake of the increase in gasoline prices in the fall of 1973, following the OPEC oil embargo. Later, this was called a &quot;Boston Oil Party&quot; by the press.

On April 17–18 the group camped out at Concord Bridge, Massachusetts to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Minute Men&#x27;s 1775 fight with the British which marked the beginning of our independence and according to White House documents, attempted to disrupt an appearance by President Gerald R. Ford where he was to lay a wreath at the Minute Man Statue. https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0067/7580533.pdf

On July 4, 1976, the People&#x27;s Bicentennial Commission staged a rally on the Capitol Mall as an alternative to the other Bicentennial celebrations. https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0067/1563322.pdf

In 1977, with Ted Howard, he founded the Foundation on Economic Trends (FOET), which is active in both national and international public policy issues related to the environment, the economy, and climate change. FOET examines new trends and their effects on the environment, the economy, culture, and society, and it engages in litigation, public education, coalition building, and grassroots organizing activities to advance their goals. Rifkin became one of the first major critics of the nascent biotechnology industry with the 1977 publication of his book, &quot;Who Should Play God?&quot;

In 1978, Jeremy Rifkin and Randy Barber co-authored the book &quot;The North Will Rise Again: Pensions, Politics, and Power in the 1980s&quot;. The book and subsequent activist engagement by the authors with the American Labor Union movement, the financial community, and civil society organizations helped spawn the era of socially responsible investment of public and union pension funds in America. An article on socially responsible investment in the New York University Review of Law and Social Change noted that &quot;the idea of socially responsible investing, long a concern of only special interest groups, achieved widespread attention in 1978 with the publication of Jeremy Rifkin and Randy Barber&#x27;s &quot;The North Will Rise Again&quot;.&quot; The book helped lay the early groundwork for what later would evolve into the principles of environment, society, and governance (ESG) standards in investments.

===1980s===
Rifkin&#x27;s 1980 book, &quot;&quot;, discusses how the physical concept of entropy applies to nuclear and solar energy, urban decay, military activity, education, agriculture, health, economics, and politics. It was called &quot;A comprehensive worldview&quot; and &quot;an appropriate successor to... &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, &quot;The Closing Circle&quot;, &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;, and &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;&quot; by the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;. Rifkin&#x27;s work was heavily influenced by the ideas expressed by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in his 1971 book &quot;The Entropy Law and the Economic Process&quot;. In Rifkin&#x27;s 1989 revised edition of &quot;Entropy:...&quot;, entitled &quot;Entropy: Into the Greenhouse World&quot;, its &quot;afterword&quot; was written by Georgescu-Roegen.

In 1980, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of granting a patent on the first genetically engineered life form with 5 justices favoring the patent and 4 justices opposed. Jeremy Rifkin&#x27;s office - The People&#x27;s Business Commission - provided an amicus curiae brief in support of the US Patent and Trademark Office, arguing that extending patents to genetically-engineered organisms was not covered by US patent law. Speaking on behalf of the majority opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger referred to the petitioners&#x27; briefs as &quot;the gruesome parade of horribles&quot; and argued that &quot;the relevant distinction was not between living and inanimate things, but between products of nature, whether living or not, and human-made inventions&quot;. Speaking for the minority opinion, Justice William Brennan argued that &quot;it is the role of Congress, not this court, to broaden or narrow the reach of patent laws&quot; and further suggested that &quot;the composition [the genetically engineered micro-organism] sought to be patented uniquely implicates matters of public concern&quot;.

On May 16, 1984, Federal District Judge John J. Sirica issued a ruling halting an experiment that would have involved the &quot;first deliberate release into the environment of organisms altered by gene splicing&quot;. The court suit was brought by Jeremy Rifkin, the President of the Washington DC–based Foundation on Economic Trends. The plaintiff argued that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to undergo an assessment of the potential risks and consequences of releasing the genetically engineered organism into the environment before &quot;giving the testing a green light&quot;. The journal &quot;Science&quot; recorded that the ruling &quot;stunned most observers&quot;. In his ruling, Judge Sirica said that Rifkin and his legal counsel &quot;had made a satisfactory showing that they are likely to succeed&quot; in their lawsuit. In the meantime, &quot;Science&quot; reported that Judge Sirica told NIH &quot;not to approve any more experiments by academic researchers involving release of modified organisms&quot;. The court ruling was credited with beginning the process of regulating the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment in the United States and around the world.

In 1989, Rifkin brought together climate scientists and environmental activists from 35 nations in Washington, D.C., for the first meeting of the Global Greenhouse Network. In the same year, Rifkin did a series of Hollywood lectures on global warming and related environmental issues for a diverse assortment of film, television, and music industry leaders, with the goal of organizing the Hollywood community for a campaign. Shortly thereafter, two Hollywood environmental organizations, Earth Communications Office (ECO) and the Environmental Media Association, were formed.
Also in 1989 Rifkin, with a group of environmentalists, attempted to prevent the launch of a NASA rocket that was expected to lift the Galileo space probe, claiming it carried a &quot;very high risk&quot; of explosion and &quot;spraying deadly plutonium&quot; over the territory of the USA. The lawsuit was eventually rejected, and the Galileo mission succeeded.

===1990s===
In 1992, Rifkin published the book &quot;Beyond Beef&quot;. In its review, the Washington Post praised the book for its &quot;fresh thinking and well-reasoned arguments...[and for] combining reliable research with logical conclusions&quot;, noting that &quot;[Rifkin] offers enough economic, medical, environmental, and ethical arguments to persuade any open minded person to pass by the meat (en)counter.” 

That same year, Rifkin and the Foundation on Economic Trends launched the Pure Food Campaign to demand government labeling of all genetically engineered foods. The campaign was spearheaded by more than 1,500 of the nation’s leading chefs.

In 1993, Rifkin launched the Beyond Beef Campaign, a coalition of six environmental groups including Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network, and Public Citizen, with the goal of encouraging a 50% reduction in the consumption of beef, arguing that methane emissions from cattle has a warming effect 23 times greater than carbon dioxide.

His 1995 book, &quot;The End of Work&quot;, is credited by some with helping shape the current global debate on automation, technology displacement, corporate downsizing, and the future of jobs. Reporting on the growing controversy over automation and technology displacement in 2011, &quot;The Economist&quot; pointed out that Rifkin drew attention to the trend back in 1996 with the publication of his book, &quot;The End of Work&quot;. Then &quot;The Economist&quot; asked &quot;what happens... when machines are smart enough to become workers? In other words, when capital becomes labor.&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; noted that &quot;this is what Jeremy Rifkin, a social critic, was driving at in his book, &quot;The End of Work,&quot; published in 1996... Mr. Rifkin argued prophetically that society was entering a new phase, one in which fewer and fewer workers would be needed to produce all the goods and services consumed. &#x27;In the years ahead,&#x27; he wrote, &#x27;more sophisticated software technologies are going to bring civilization ever closer to a near-workerless world. The process has already begun.&quot;

His 1998 book, &quot;The Biotech Century&quot;, addresses issues accompanying the new era of genetic commerce. In its review of the book, the journal &quot;Nature&quot; observed that &quot;Rifkin does his best work in drawing attention to the growing inventory of real and potential dangers and the ethical conundrums raised by genetic technologies... At a time when scientific institutions are struggling with the public understanding of science, there is much they can learn from Rifkin&#x27;s success as a public communicator of scientific and technological trends.&quot;

In &quot;The Biotech Century&quot;, Rifkin argues that &#x27;Genetic engineering represents the ultimate tool.&#x27; &#x27;With genetic technology we assume control over the hereditary blueprints of life itself. Can any reasonable person believe for a moment that such unprecedented power is without substantial risk?&#x27; Some of the changes he highlights are: replication partially replacing reproduction; and &#x27;Genetically customized and mass-produced animal clones could be used as chemical factories to secrete—in their blood and milk—large volumes of inexpensive chemicals and drugs for human use.&#x27;

Rifkin&#x27;s work in the biological sciences includes advocacy of animal rights and animal protection around the world.

===2000s===
Rifkin&#x27;s book, &quot;The Age of Access&quot;, published in 2000, was the first to introduce the concept that society is beginning to move from ownership of property in markets, to access to services in networks, giving rise to the sharing economy. According to the Journal of Consumer Research, &quot;the phenomenon of access was first documented in the popular business press by Rifkin (2000), who primarily examines the business-to-business sector and argues that we are living in an age of access in which property regimes have changed to access regimes characterized by short-term limited use of assets controlled by networks of suppliers.&quot;

Rifkin published the book &quot;The Hydrogen Economy: The Creation of the Worldwide Energy Web and the Redistribution of Power on Earth&quot; in 2002. That same year, Mr. Rifkin, who at the time served as an advisor to Romano Prodi, then President of the European Commission, developed a strategic white paper committing the European Union to a multi-billion Euro research and development plan that would transform the EU into a green hydrogen economic paradigm. Mr. Rifkin joined Prodi at a European Union conference in October 2002 to announce &quot;a coordinated long-term plan for Europe to make the transition from fossil-fuel dependency to become the first &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; superpower of the 21st century&quot;. President Prodi remarked that the EU hydrogen R&amp;D initiative would be as significant for the future of Europe as the space program was for the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s.

After the publication of &quot;The Hydrogen Economy&quot; (2002), Rifkin worked both in the U.S. and Europe to advance the political cause of renewably generated hydrogen. In the U.S., Rifkin was instrumental in founding the Green Hydrogen Coalition, consisting of 13 environmental and political organizations (including Greenpeace and MoveOn.org) committed to building a renewable hydrogen-based economy.

His 2004 book, &quot;The European Dream&quot;, was an international bestseller and winner of the 2005 Corine International Book Prize in Germany for the best economics book of the year. In its review of the book, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; noted that &quot;Rifkin makes a compelling case for [the European] vision, which he says is usurping the American Dream as a global ideal … a fascinating study of the differences between the American and European psyches.&quot;

In 2009 Rifkin published The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis. In a review of the book in the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, Ariana Huffington writes: “Rifkin is that rare breed, one whose disappearance is often and rightly bemoaned: a public intellectual. Rifkin… takes a look at the new scientific discoveries that lead to the conclusion that rather than being naturally aggressive, acquisitive, and self-involved, humans are ‘a fundamentally empathic species’ -- what Rifkin calls &quot;Homo empathicus&quot;… &quot;The Empathic Civilization&quot; is a fascinating book that boldly challenges the conventional view of human nature and seeks to replace that view with a counter-narrative that allows humanity to see itself as an extended family living in a shared and interconnected world.”

===2011–2012===
In 2011, Rifkin published &quot;The Third Industrial Revolution; How Lateral Power is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World&quot;. The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller, and has been translated into 19 languages. By 2014, approximately 500,000 copies were in print in China alone.

Rifkin delivered a keynote address at the Global Green Summit 2012 on May 10, 2012. The conference was hosted by the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), in association with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea also gave a speech at the conference and embraced the Third Industrial Revolution to advance a green economy.

In December 2012, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; reported that the newly-elected premier of China, Li Keqiang is a fan of Rifkin and had &quot;told his state scholars to pay close attention&quot; to Rifkin&#x27;s book, &quot;The Third Industrial Revolution: How Lateral Power is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the World&quot;.

Rifkin received the &quot;America Award&quot; of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2012. He currently works out of an office in Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C.

===2013–2014===
In April 2014, Rifkin published &quot;The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism&quot;. Fortune called the book, &quot;admirable in its scope... a heartening narrative of what our economic future may hold for the generations to come.&quot; The book was translated into fifteen languages.

===2015===
Rifkin was awarded an honorary doctorate from Hasselt University in Belgium in the spring of 2015. Rifkin also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Liege in Belgium in the Fall of 2015.

In November 2015, the Huffington Post reported from Beijing that &quot;Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has not only read Jeremy Rifkin&#x27;s book, The Third Industrial Revolution, and taken it to heart. He and his colleagues have also made it the core of the country&#x27;s thirteenth Five-Year Plan announced in Beijing on October 29th.&quot; The Huffington Post went on to say that &quot;this blueprint for China&#x27;s future signals the most momentous shift in direction since the death of Mao and the advent of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reform and opening up in 1978.&quot;

=== 2016 ===
In 2016, TIR Consulting Group, LLC and Rifkin, its president, were commissioned by both the Metropolitan Region of Rotterdam - The Hague (MRDH) and the grand Duchy of Luxembourg to oversee the development of regional master plans to transform each governing jurisdiction into a zero emission Third Industrial Revolution infrastructure and economy. Citizens assemblies were established in each region to work alongside TIR Consulting Group&#x27;s team to conceptualize and enact far-reaching initiatives to address climate change and &quot;green&quot; their respective economies and societies.

=== 2017 ===
On January 31, 2017, the European Central Bank hosted a conference on the theme “Into the Future: Europe’s Digital Integrated Market”. Rifkin delivered a keynote address on transforming the European Union into a smart third industrial revolution paradigm. On February 7, 2017, the European Commission and the European Committee of the Regions hosted a conference in Brussels on the theme “Investing in Europe: building a coalition of smart cities and regions toward a Third Industrial Revolution”. Jeremy Rifkin joined Maros Sefcovic, vice president of the European Commission, and Markku Markkula, president of the European Committee of the Regions, in a presentation of the smart city and smart region agenda across the European Union.

Jeremy Rifkin is the executive co-producer and star of a feature-length documentary film produced by VICE Media entitled &quot;The Third Industrial Revolution: A Radical New Sharing Economy&quot;. The film, subtitled in nineteen languages, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017, and has been live on YouTube since 2018. As of May 2023, the film had been viewed 8 million times.

=== 2019 ===
In September 2019, Rifkin published &quot;The Green New Deal: Why the Fossil Fuel Civilization will Collapse by 2028, and the Bold Economic Plan to Save Life on Earth&quot;. In its review of the book, &quot;Forbes&quot; noted that &quot;[Jeremy Rifkin] is a principal architect of the European Union’s long-term economic vision, Smart Europe, and a key advisor to China&#x27;s Third Industrial Revolution vision... His new book, The Green New Deal, is essentially an attempt to rouse the United States from its slumber within a collapsing 20th century fossil fuel era.&quot;

That same year, the European Commission and its president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the European Green Deal, a plan to make Europe &quot;the first climate neutral continent in the world&quot; by 2050. The European Commission presented a spectrum of proposals, projects, and initiatives under the rubric of &quot;Leading The Third Industrial Revolution&quot;, signaling a fundamental transformation of the European economy and society.

=== 2020 ===
Rifkin was a recipient of the 13th annual German Sustainability Award in December 2020 for his work on addressing climate change. The award was presented to Mr. Rifkin in a laudatory address by Sigmar Gabriel, the former Foreign Minister, Vice-Chancellor, Economic Minister, and Environmental Minister of Germany.
=== 2021 ===
Jeremy Rifkin and TIR Consulting Group, LLC and partners published a $16 trillion, twenty-year America 3.0 Resilient Infrastructure plan, prepared for Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer and first released by Bloomberg on July 29 in an article entitled &quot;Energy Guru is Beyond Disappointed with Dwindling US Infrastructure Plan&quot;.

The America 3.0 infrastructure transformation 2022-2042 details a massive investment to scale, deploy, and manage a smart digital zero-emission Third Industrial Revolution infrastructure for a 21st century economy. The plan will create an average of 15 to 22 million net new jobs over the period 2022 to 2042. For every dollar invested, it is projected to return $2.90 in GDP between 2022 and 2042.

The Bloomberg article noted that &quot;For almost two decades the U.S. author and climate activist Jeremy Rifkin has advised governments in Europe and China on how to retool their economies for what he calls a third industrial revolution.&quot;

Rifkin also provided the economic and environmental commentary in the fifth and final episode of the BBC documentary series A Perfect Planet, starring Sir David Attenborough.

=== 2022 ===
In November 2022, Rifkin published &quot;The Age of Resilience: Reimagining Existence on a Rewilding Earth&quot;. In its review of the book, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; noted that &quot;...The influential US thinker...[argues that] humanity is shifting to an age of resilience that could transform our relationship with the natural world and each other...Rifkin sees a future of sweeping economic and social shifts where productivity gives way to regenerativity and gross domestic product to quality of life indicators. Consumerism, corporate conglomerates and globalisation all wither while “eco-stewardship”, high-tech co-operatives and “glocalisation” flourish. The book will undoubtedly prove beguiling for many readers, even as it infuriates others. It is rarely different for a writer who has spent decades warning of the need to address environmental problems that the human species caused and is still struggling to fix.”

== Reception ==
According to The &quot;European Energy Review&quot;, &quot;Perhaps no other author or thinker has had more influence on the EU&#x27;s ambitious climate and energy policy than Jeremy Rifkin. In the United States, he has testified before numerous congressional committees and has had success in litigation to ensure responsible government policies on a variety of environmental, scientific and technology related issues. The Union of Concerned Scientists has cited some of Rifkin&#x27;s publications as useful references for consumers and &quot;The New York Times&quot; once stated that &quot;others in the scholarly, religious, and political fields praise Jeremy Rifkin for a willingness to think big, raise controversial questions, and serve as a social and ethical prophet&quot;

===Criticism===
Rifkin&#x27;s work is controversial due to a purported lack of scientific rigor in his claims as well as some of the tactics he has used to promote his views. These include claims that the theory of evolution is a product of &quot;19th century industrial capitalism&quot; and frequent use of the strawman fallacy. Referring to Rifkin&#x27;s 1984 book, &quot;Algeny: A New Word--A New World&quot;, Stephen Jay Gould stated:

In a profile article in 1989, TIME Magazine called Jeremy Rifkin the &quot;most hated man in science&quot; and the &quot;nation&#x27;s foremost opponent of environmental neglect... Rifkin is surely justified in seeking precise regulations for genetic research, to protect the health of the individual and the environment. [...] But there is good reason to question the fairness of Rifkin&#x27;s angriest assaults on scientists as mad magicians and unethical disciples of Dr. Strangelove. When Rifkin is most successful, he may slow basic research, delay a medical advance, perhaps even damage the economy.&quot;

<text>The Irish House of Lords was the upper house of the Parliament of Ireland that existed from medieval times until the end of 1800. It was also the final court of appeal of the Kingdom of Ireland.

It was modelled on the House of Lords of England, with members of the Peerage of Ireland sitting in the Irish Lords, just as members of the Peerage of England did at Westminster. When the Act of Union 1800 abolished the Irish parliament, a subset of Irish peers sat as Irish representative peers in the House of Lords of the merged Parliament of the United Kingdom.

==History==
The Lords started as a group of barons in the Lordship of Ireland that was generally limited to the Pale, a variable area around Dublin where English law was in effect, but did extend to the rest of Ireland. They sat as a group, not as a separate House, from the first meeting of the Parliament of Ireland in 1297. From the establishment of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542 the Lords included a large number of new Gaelic and Norman lords under the policy of surrender and regrant.

Religious division was reflected in the House, but as late as the 1689 &quot;Patriot Parliament&quot; a majority of Lords had remained Roman Catholics, while the administration and a slight majority in the Commons were Anglicans, adherents of the Church of Ireland. In 1634 the campaign to secure &quot;The Graces&quot; came to a head. Most of these Catholic lords lost their titles in the ensuing 1641 rebellion, notably during the 1652 Cromwellian Settlement. These dispossessed lords were regranted their titles (if not always their lands) after the Restoration of 1660 by the Act of Settlement 1662. Others took the losing side in the Williamite War in Ireland (1689–91), and a much smaller number of them were re-granted their lands in the 18th century.

By the 1790s most of the Lords personified and wanted to protect the &quot;Protestant Ascendancy&quot;. By the time of the abolition of the Irish House of Lords in 1800 some of the peerages were very ancient, such as the lords Kingsale, created in 1397, and the viscounts Gormanston from 1478. The first Earl of Kildare had been created in 1316.

Following the Act of Union in 1800, the peerage of Ireland elected just 28 of their number to sit in the United Kingdom House of Lords, described as the &quot;Irish representative peers&quot;. This practice ended in 1922 with the establishment of the Irish Free State. Other newly created Irish peers, such as Clive of India, the Earl of Carysfort and Lord Curzon, were still able to stand for election to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom (not being UK peers) if they were not a representative peer. This was a convenient way of giving a title for reasons of prestige to someone who expected to sit in the British House of Commons.

Today the 18th-century Irish Parliament building on College Green in Dublin is an office of the commercial Bank of Ireland, and visitors can view the Irish House of Lords chamber within the building.

==Function==
The Parliament of Ireland was a bicameral legislature, and bills could originate in either the Commons or the Lords; both had to pass a bill for it to stand a chance of becoming law. Either house could amend or reject the others&#x27; proposals. Under Poynings&#x27; Law, matters passed by the Irish parliament had to be approved and could be amended by the Irish Privy Council and English Privy Council; main debates before this stage were thus technically on &quot;heads of bills&quot;. Following approval the Parliament of Ireland voted on the formal finalised &quot;bill&quot; (which could only be rejected or passed unamended).

The Lords was the highest court of appeal in Ireland, same as the Lords were in England. However, the controversial British Declaratory Act 1719 asserted the right of the Lords in Westminster to overrule the Irish Lords. The Irish Patriot Party secured the repeal of the Declaratory Act as part of the Constitution of 1782.

The House of Lords was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sat on the woolsack, a large seat stuffed with wool from each of the three lands of England, Ireland and Scotland. At the state opening of the Irish parliament Members of Parliament were summoned to the House of Lords from the House of Commons chamber by Black Rod, a royal official who would &quot;command the members on behalf of His Excellency to attend him in the chamber of peers&quot;. Sessions were formally opened by the Speech from the Throne by the Lord Lieutenant, who sat on the throne beneath a canopy of crimson velvet.

Sessions were generally held at Dublin Castle in the 16th and 17th centuries, until the opening of the Irish Houses of Parliament in the 1730s.

<text>On My Way to Paradise is a science fiction novel by American writer Dave Wolverton, published in 1989 by Bantam Books. It is set in the far future (circa 2300AD) depicting a man, Angelo Osic, who is running from an ever-changing and frightening world of war and politics.

The novel was based on a short story with the same title, which was awarded the L. Ron Hubbard Gold Award at the 1987 Writers of the Future contest.

==Plot==
Osic is a morphogenic pharmacologist who tended in a booth in a feria in Gatun city, Panama. He is approached by a stranger, the woman Tamara Marian de la Garza, who requires him to regrow her right hand. The bloody stump on the end of her arm, signifying a traumatic amputation. It transpires that she is on the run from powerful political forces, the assassins of which attempt to kill her and Osic.

He flees from the Earth with Tamara who is in an incapacitated state. On board the orbital shuttle, he attempts to get employment with a Japanese company, Motoki Corporation, as a Pharmacologist, but his application is rejected. Instead he is offered to fight as a mercenary for Motoki, who are attempting to gain control of the planet Baker, a satellite of the Delta Pavonis system. The story describes Osic&#x27;s reaction to the intense battle training that takes place on board the starship &quot;Chaeron&quot; and his interaction with the mostly South American refugiados, and chimeras, genetically upgraded humans, who are also escaping their uncertain future on Earth.

Their arrival on Baker highlights the vast cultural differences between the mercenaries and their Japanese employers, who have trained them to fight a rival Japanese company of settlers, the Yabajin. These differences culminate in rebellion, with the mercenaries (now self described as Conquistadors) seizing the Motoki city, after a bloody battle and then setting out to attack the Yabajin settlement which lay 3,000 kilometers away. across forbidding deserts, encountering the wildlife of Baker.

<text>A trading post, trading station, or trading house, also known as a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in European and colonial contexts, is an establishment or settlement where goods and services could be traded.

Typically a trading post allows people from one geographic area to exchange for goods produced in another area. Usually money is not used. The barter that occurs often includes an aspect of haggling. In some examples, local inhabitants can use a trading post to exchange what they have (such as locally-harvested furs) for goods they wish to acquire (such as manufactured trade goods imported from industrialized places).

Given bulk transportation costs, exchanges made at a trading post for long-distance distribution can involve items which either party or both parties regard as luxury goods.

A trading post can consist either of a single building or of an entire town. Trading posts have been established in a range of areas, including relatively remote ones, but most often near an ocean, a river, or another source of a natural resource. A prominent geographical location and the head start provided by an early trading post ensured that trading posts feature in the history of many of today&#x27;s cities, such as Timbuktu
and Hong Kong.

==Examples==
Major towns in the Hanseatic League were known as &quot;kontors&quot;, a form of trading posts.

Charax Spasinu was a trading post between the Roman and Parthian Empires.

Manhattan and Singapore were both established as trading posts, by Dutchman Peter Minuit and Englishman Stamford Raffles respectively, and later developed into major settlements.

The City of Edmonton, Alberta began as Fort Edmonton in 1812.

The Roman Empire was able to control a large amount of land because of its efficient systems for transferring information, goods, and military expeditions across large distances. Goods specifically were vital to maintaining outposts in territories distant from Rome, such as northern Africa and western Asia. Trading posts played a large part in managing these goods, deciding where they were going and when. Goods collected at these trading posts and other parts of the Roman trade system included precious stones, fabrics, ivory, and wine. There is also evidence that cattle were traded at the Empúries trading post, established in the 6th century BCE, on the Iberian Peninsula.

==North American frontier==
Trading houses were typically strategically located and stocked with goods that Native Americans and other trappers would trade furs for. These goods included clothing, blankets, axes, beads, corn, wheat flour, and liquor. Eric Jay Dolin&#x27;s &quot;Fur, Fortune, and Empire&quot; provides a history of trading posts in North America. 

Plymouth colonists established Kennebec Trading House in 1628. This was followed by the Plymouth Penobscot trading post. Conflicts between French and Plymouth colonists occurred in 1631 when Frenchmen arrived at the Plymouth Penobscot trading post. The masters of the trading post and most of the crew were absent, leaving only a few servants (employees) to attend to the Frenchmen. When the Frenchmen learned this was the case, they feigned interest in guns available at the trading post, which when they got their hands on them, they turned back onto the servants. They obtained all valuables, leaving with £500 of goods and £300 in beaver pelts.

John Jacob Astor founded the American Fur Company (AFC). One of the great feats achieved by the AFC was the establishment of a trading post in the native Blackfoot tribe&#x27;s territory, located in modern-day Montana along the Rocky Mountains. The Blackfoot tribe had killed many Euro-Americans and, up to this point, had only traded with the Hudson Bay Company. In order to erect a trading post in Blackfoot territory, the AFC needed a way to establish contact on their behalf. Jacob Berger, a trapper, offered Kenneth McKenzie to serve as this contact and get the AFC into negotiations with the Blackfoot. The talks were successful, and McKenzie was allowed to build a trading post in Blackfoot territory, adjacent to the Missouri and Marias Rivers, naming it Fort McKenzie.

The American post, Noochuloghoyet Trading Post, was established in the last 19th century in central Alaska adjacent to the Yukon River. This was an important trading post for the fur trade. It operated under different names, and its level of business activity varied greatly while it was in operation.

==Other uses==
* In the context of scouting, trading post usually refers to a camp store in which snacks, craft materials, and general merchandise are sold. &quot;Trading posts&quot; also refers to a cub scout activity in which cub teams (or individuals) undertake challenge activities in exchange for points.
* A &quot;trading post&quot; also once referred to a trading booth within the New York Stock Exchange.

<text>Brookfield Road (Ottawa Road #51) is a short connecting street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It runs from Riverside Drive (as a continuation of Hog&#x27;s Back Road through lands owned by the National Capital Commission) past Brookfield High School to the Airport Parkway, and then in a separate segment as a local road in a residential area for some distance toward Bank Street.

These two segments were continuous prior to the construction of the Airport Parkway, which eradicated a small railway-junction settlement whose traces can still be seen just southeast of the interchange.

The main segment of Brookfield is a four-lane undivided minor arterial road, with a speed limit of .

Before 1997, the NCC had control over Brookfield Road, as it connected Colonel By Drive to the Airport Parkway. However, it changed jurisdiction when the Airport Parkway was handed to the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton (now the City of Ottawa), making the NCC parkway link redundant.

<doc id="500744" wikidata="Q732048" url="?curid=500744" title="Marshall Rosenberg">
<text>Marshall Bertram Rosenberg (October 6, 1934February 7, 2015) was an American psychologist, mediator, author and teacher. Starting in the early 1960s, he developed nonviolent communication, a process for supporting partnership and resolving conflict within people, relationships, and society. He worked worldwide as a peacemaker, and in 1984 founded the Center for Nonviolent Communication, an international nonprofit organization for which he served as Director of Educational Services.

Marshall Rosenberg&#x27;s motivation for developing nonviolent communication was based on his own experiences at the Detroit race riot of 1943, as well as the antisemitism that he experienced in his early life.

==Family==
Rosenberg was born in Canton, Ohio, to Jewish parents. His parents were Jean () Rosenberg and Fred Donald Rosenberg. Rosenberg&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Anna Satovsky Wiener, had nine children. His grandfather worked at Packard Motor Car Company and his grandmother taught workers&#x27; children to dance. Wiener spent her final years living with ALS with the Rosenbergs, and Rosenberg credits his family&#x27;s compassionate care for Wiener during the period in his later work.

In Steubenville, Ohio, Rosenberg&#x27;s father loaded trucks with wholesale grocery stock, and Rosenberg himself went to a three-room school. Jean Rosenberg was a professional bowler with tournaments five nights per week. She was also a gambler with high-stakes backers. His parents divorced twice: once when Rosenberg was three and again when he left home.

The family moved to Detroit, Michigan, one week before the Detroit race riot of 1943 in which 34 people were killed and 433 wounded. At an inner-city school, Rosenberg discovered anti-Semitism and internalized it. Rosenberg married his first wife, Vivian, in 1961. They had three children. In 1974, he married his second wife, Gloria, whom he divorced in 1999. He married his third wife, Valentina (a.k.a. Kidini) in 2005, with whom he remained until his death in 2015.

==Education==
At age 13 Rosenberg began Hebrew school but got expelled. Twice his father beat him, once so badly he missed school the next day. After Rosenberg&#x27;s father bought a house in a better neighborhood, Rosenberg attended Cooley High School and graduated in 1952 as valedictorian. When considering medicine as a career, Rosenberg worked with an embalmer for a while to measure his interest in the human body.

Rosenberg&#x27;s first college was Wayne State University. He then entered the University of Michigan, and he worked as a waiter at a sorority and a cook&#x27;s help at a fraternity. Putting up with anti-Semitism, he graduated in three years. The State of Wisconsin paid for Rosenberg&#x27;s training as a psychologist.

Professor Michael Hakeem taught Rosenberg that psychology and psychiatry were dangerous, since scientific and value judgments were mixed in the fields. Hakeem also had Rosenberg read about traditional moral therapy in which clients were seen as down on their luck rather than sick. Rosenberg was influenced by the 1961 books &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot; by Thomas Szasz and &quot;Asylums&quot; by Erving Goffman. He also remembered reading Albert Bandura on &quot;Psychotherapy as a learning process&quot;.

Rosenberg&#x27;s practicum placements were the Wisconsin Diagnostic Center, schools for delinquent girls and boys, and Mendota State Hospital. There, psychiatrist Bernie Banham &quot;would never have it where we would talk about a client in his absence&quot;. In Mendota, Rosenberg began to practice family therapy with all parties present, including children. After graduation, Rosenberg worked in Winnebago with Gordon Filmer-Bennett for a year to fulfill his obligation to the state for his graduate training.

==Practice==

In 1961, Rosenberg received his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he studied under Carl Rogers. His dissertation, &quot;Situational Structure and Self-evaluation&quot;, prefigured certain key aspects of his later work with nonviolent communication by focusing on &quot;the relationship between (the) structure of social situations and two dimensions of self evaluation; positive self evaluation and certainty of self evaluation&quot;. In 1966 he was awarded Diplomate status in clinical psychology from the American Board of Examiners in Professional Psychology.

Rosenberg started out in clinical practice in Saint Louis, Missouri, forming Psychological Associates with partners. In making an analysis of problems of children in school, he found learning disabilities. He wrote his first book, &quot;Diagnostic Teaching&quot;, in 1968, reporting his findings. He also met Al Chappelle, a leader in the Zulu 1200s, a black liberation group in St. Louis. Rosenberg went to teach his approach to conflict resolution to the group in exchange for Chappelle appearing at desegregation conventions, starting in Washington, D.C. While Chappelle was harnessing communication against racism, Vicki Legion began to collaborate to counter sexism. &quot;I started to give my services, instead of to individual affluent clients, to people on the firing line like Al and Vicki, and others fighting in behalf of human rights of various groups.&quot;

The superintendent of schools, Thomas Shaheen, in Rockford, Illinois called upon Rosenberg to deal with conflicts in an alternative school that was established. In 1970 Shaheen became superintendent of schools in San Francisco, California and was charged with racially integrating the city&#x27;s schools. He called on Rosenberg to help as before and Rosenberg organized a group but Shaheen was dismissed before it could come into action. Rosenberg decided to stay in California and promoted the Community Council for Mutual Education with the help of Vicki Legion.

He worked for four years in Norfolk, Virginia&#x27;s school integration. Rosenberg was called to many states, countries, and conflicts to provide his expertise in nonviolent communication. In 2004 he was visiting about 35 countries per year on his mission as a travelling peacemaker. From his home base at Albuquerque, Rosenberg supported his followers elsewhere with a Center of Nonviolent Communication in New Mexico. He died at home on February 7, 2015.

<text>al-Ismāʿīliyya al-khāliṣa / al-Ismāʿīliyya al-wāqifa or Seveners () was a branch of Ismā&#x27;īlī Shīʻa. They broke off from the more numerous Twelvers after the death of Jafar al-Sadiq in 765 AD. They became known as &quot;Seveners&quot; because they believed that Isma&#x27;il ibn Ja&#x27;far was the seventh and last Imam (hereditary leader of the Muslim community in the direct line of Ali). They believed his son, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, would return and bring about an age of justice as Mahdi. Their most well-known and active branch were the Qarmatians.

== History, Shia schisms, and Seveners ==
=== Seveners and the Fatimid dynasty ===
== List of Imams ==
Sometimes &quot;Sevener&quot; is used to refer to Ismā&#x27;īlīs overall, though mainstream Musta&#x27;li and Nizari Isma&#x27;ilis have far more than seven imams.

==Ismaili imams who were not accepted as legitimate by Seveners==
The following Ismaili imams after Mahdi had been considered as heretics of dubious origins by certain Qarmatian groups who refused to acknowledge the imamate of the Fatimids and clung to their belief in the coming of the Mahdi.

* Abadullah ibn Muhammad (Ahmad al-Wafi) (813–829)
* Ahmad ibn Abadullah (Muhammad at-Taqi) (829–840)
* Husayn ibn Ahmad (Radi Abdullah) (840–881)
* Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah (881–934) (Founder of Fatimid Caliphate)

<text>The Popular Front of Latvia () was a political organisation in Latvia in the late 1980s and early 1990s which led Latvia to its independence from the Soviet Union. It was similar to the Popular Front of Estonia and the Sąjūdis movement in Lithuania.

Its newspaper was &quot;Atmoda&quot; (&quot;Awakening&quot;, cf. Latvian National Awakening), printed in the Latvian and Russian languages during 1989-1992.

==Historic background==
Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940–1941, by Nazi Germany in 1941–1944 and again by the Soviet Union in 1944–1991.

In 1940, almost immediately an armed resistance started, which under the name of Forest Brothers continued until 1956. A chance to regain independence came in 1980s when Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to reform the Soviet Union. In particular, Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;glasnost&quot; policy allowed more freedom of speech in the Soviet Union than ever before.

Beginning in 1986, Latvians began to organise around specific causes. One of the first successes in challenging Moscow was the stoppage of the building of the 4th hydroelectric dam near Daugavpils on the Daugava, the main river in Latvia. This protest inspired the formation of the Environmental Protection Club, which saw the environmentally driven protests as a channel through which to challenge the Soviet regime more broadly.

Latvia&#x27;s independence movement started with small demonstrations for independence and human rights in 1986. The first demonstrations, organised by Helsinki-86, were, however, suppressed by the government of Latvian SSR. The breaking point came in summer 1988. Many prominent Latvians publicly announced their support for increased autonomy for Latvia. Latvian newspapers started writing about aspects of Latvian history which had been banned during the Soviet period (for example, how Latvia had been occupied in 1940). The flag of Latvia which had been banned during the Soviet period was brought back. To summarise, a strong resurgence of Latvian national identity had started.

==Popular Front from 1988 to 1990==
This resurgence created several political organisations devoted to increased autonomy or independence for Latvia. The LTF was the biggest organisation. It was founded on 9 October 1988. Originally, Tautas Fronte took a moderate position, requesting wide autonomy for Latvia but stopping short of calling for independence. Tautas Fronte was supported by moderate members of the leadership of the Latvian SSR including head of state Anatolijs Gorbunovs, but opposed by hardline Communists.

Tautas Fronte quickly grew to 250,000 members. Its goal was to create a wide coalition devoted to autonomy or independence of Latvia. As 48% of Latvia&#x27;s population was ethnically non-Latvian (mostly people who had moved to Latvia from other parts of the Soviet Union), Tautas Fronte reached out to ethnic minorities. In particular, it advocated school education in languages other than Latvian and Russian to attract the support of non-Russian minorities. At the same time, Tautas Fronte worked with more radical Latvian movements advocating the immediate independence of Latvia.

Gradually, the overall opinion within Tautas Fronte shifted from the autonomy of Latvia within the Soviet Union to full independence. On 31 May 1989, it announced that the government of the Soviet Union had not been sympathetic enough to Latvia gaining autonomy and an independent Latvia had become the only option.

In 1989 and 1990, the first free elections were held in Latvia since Kārlis Ulmanis&#x27; &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in 1934. The most important were the elections to the Supreme Soviet, the parliament of the Latvian SSR, on 18 March 1990. A pro-independence coalition, led by Tautas Fronte, won 138 out of 201 seats in the Supreme Soviet, more than the 2/3 majority needed to amend the Constitution.

==Tautas fronte from 1990 to 1993==
After the 1990 elections, Tautas fronte became the governing party in Latvia. On 4 May 1990, the first law passed by the new Supreme Soviet declared Latvia&#x27;s intention to restore independence. Dainis Īvāns, the chairman of Tautas fronte, became the deputy speaker of parliament and his deputy, Ivars Godmanis, became the prime minister. Many other members of Tautas fronte took key positions in the government of Latvia.

From May 1990 to August 1991, Latvia went through a tense period. Its independence was not recognised by the government of the Soviet Union and a military crackdown threatened by the Soviet government was generally feared.

Several Soviet tanks appeared on the bank of the Daugava river in the Riga Old Town. Television networks broadcast footage of rifle shots being exchanged at night in Old Town on the evening of 13 January 1991. On the streets unarmed people built the Barricades and spent days and nights guarding them, singing Latvian songs. Because of this the independence movement is now known as &quot;the Singing Revolution&quot;.

The independence of Latvia was finally recognised after the failure of the Soviet putsch in August 1991. The main political goal of Tautas fronte was thus achieved. It now faced a more difficult task: reforming the socialist economy of Latvia into a free-market system. The economic transition was very difficult, with the GDP of Latvia halving from 1990 to 1993. With the economy in severe decline, the popularity of the Godmanis cabinet declined. Many politicians left Tautas fronte and formed new political parties to avoid being associated with the unpopular government.

==The end of Tautas fronte==
In June 1993, Latvia held the first elections of the parliament since the restoration of independence. Weakened by economic difficulties and defections of many politicians, the Godmanis-led Tautas fronte received just 2.62% of the popular vote and gained no seats in the new parliament. It attempted to reinvent itself as a Christian democratic party and changed its name to &quot;Kristīgā Tautas partija&quot; (Christian People&#x27;s Party) but without much success. Eventually, it merged with another party, &quot;Kristīgi demokrātiskā savienība&quot; (Christian Democratic Union). The People&#x27;s Front finally dissolved itself on 9 October 1999 during its 9th congress.

==Legacy==

All or almost all the political goals of Tautas fronte have been achieved. Latvia is now an independent country, with Latvian as the only official language. Its economy and politics, formerly socialist and oriented towards the Soviet Union, is now free-market and European-oriented. While Tautas fronte itself ceased to exist during the economic difficulties of the mid-1990s, many of its former activists have important roles in today&#x27;s Latvia.

The Museum of the Popular Front of Latvia is located in its former offices, which are owned by the state, in Vecpilsētas iela 13/15 in Riga.

<text>Michael Glen Wayne Ryder (born March 31, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger. He played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Montreal Canadiens, Boston Bruins, Dallas Stars, and New Jersey Devils.

Ryder was a member of the 2011 Stanley Cup-winning Bruins squad, scoring eight goals during the 2011 Stanley Cup Playoffs to help Boston to their first title since 1972.

==Playing career==
===Junior===
Ryder played for the Hull Olympiques of the QMJHL.

===Montreal Canadiens===
Ryder was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, 8th round, 216th overall. He hired hockey agent Thayne Campbell before signing with Montreal.

On May 30, 2003, Ryder scored the winning goal to end the longest game in American Hockey League history. His goal at 14:56 of the fourth overtime period gave the Hamilton Bulldogs a 2–1 win over the Houston Aeros in Game 2 of the Calder Cup Finals.

In the 2003–04 NHL season, he played in the NHL YoungStars Game. He was named the NHL Rookie of the Month for February 2004. He finished the season leading all rookies in points, powerplay points, shots, and goals. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout he played for Leksands IF of the second division of Swedish hockey. He reached 30 goals in back-to-back seasons after the lockout.

On April 7, 2007, he scored a natural hat-trick in the 2nd period against the Toronto Maple Leafs when the Canadiens were down 3–1. This was the most important game of the regular season since the Leafs, Canadiens, and the New York Islanders were vying for the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, and the game would determine which team would take the last playoff spot. Despite Ryder&#x27;s effort, the Canadiens eventually lost the game 6–5.

The Canadiens fared better from another excellent performance from Ryder in a historic comeback against the New York Rangers on February 19, 2008. Ryder scored two goals and added an assist in a 6–5 win after the Canadiens were trailing by a score of 5–0. At the time, this comeback marked the only time the Canadiens won when trailing 5–0 in the team&#x27;s 99-year history. Ryder was initially credited with a hat trick, however, his last goal was later changed as it was determined that his shot went off teammate Mark Streit&#x27;s leg before hitting the back of the net.

Ryder&#x27;s contract expired on June 30, 2008, and the Canadiens did not re-sign him, due in part to his scoring only 14 goals and 17 assists for 31 points, the lowest totals of his career. He also played in only 4 of Montreal&#x27;s 12 playoff games.
===Boston Bruins===
On July 1, 2008, Ryder signed a contract with the Boston Bruins for 3 years worth approximately $4 million per season. It is thought that part of the reason Ryder signed with Boston was that Ryder has had nearly six seasons worth of play (three in junior hockey, one in the AHL and two with the Canadiens) under Claude Julien, the Bruins coach at the time.

On October 9, 2008, Ryder scored his first goal in a Bruins uniform in Boston&#x27;s season opener against the Colorado Avalanche, a 5-4 Bruins victory. The goal coincidentally was Ryder&#x27;s 100th career goal. He went on to score 27 goals in his first season with Boston as the Bruins clinched first overall in the Eastern Conference. Their first round matchup was with the eighth seeded Montreal Canadiens, Ryder&#x27;s former club. He scored four goals in the series as the Bruins made quick work of Montreal, sweeping them in four straight games. Ryder was then held to only one goal during the Bruins seven game Conference semi-finals loss to the Carolina Hurricanes.

During the Bruins&#x27; first round matchup against the Canadiens in the 2011 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Ryder came up clutch again facing his former team. He scored the game-winning goal in overtime of Game 4 and in Game 5, Ryder would go on to make a miraculous glove save while teammate and goaltender Tim Thomas was out of position. Later in 2022, the Bruins Director of Health, Fitness &amp; Wellness, John Whitesides highlighted Ryder&#x27;s glove save stating, &quot;Without that play right there, there is no Stanley Cup in 2011.&quot;

Ryder won his first and only Stanley Cup on June 15, 2011, when the Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. With this victory, Ryder became the second native of Newfoundland and Labrador to win a Stanley Cup championship after Daniel Cleary of Harbour Grace, who accomplished the feat with the Detroit Red Wings in 2008. Alex Newhook of the Colorado Avalanche joined these two when winning it in 2022.

===Dallas Stars===
On July 1, 2011, Ryder signed a two-year, $7 million contract with the Dallas Stars.

In the 2011–12 season, Ryder recorded his career high 35th goal during the Dallas Stars 3-1 win against the Edmonton Oilers on March 28, 2012, at Rexall Place in Edmonton.

===Return to Montreal===
During his second year with the Stars in the lockout shortened 2012–13 season, Ryder was traded back to the Montreal Canadiens, along with a third round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for Erik Cole.

===New Jersey Devils===
On July 5, 2013, Ryder signed a two-year, $7 million contract with the New Jersey Devils. Due to the Devils&#x27; policy under Lou Lamoriello of numbers above 40 being prohibited, Ryder switched from wearing sweater 73 to 17 during his tenure with the club.

After starting strongly in the 2013–14 season with 16 goals, Ryder struggled in the second half of the season, with only 2 goals after January 11, 2014.

January 16, 2015, Ryder played in his 800th NHL game, with the Devils falling 5-1 to the Anaheim Ducks at the Honda Center in Anaheim.

===End of career===
Ryder&#x27;s 237 goals and 484 total points in the NHL are records for players born in Newfoundland and Labrador, making him the province&#x27;s most successful hockey player ever.

June 10, 2017 Michael Ryder was inducted into Hockey NL&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="500819" wikidata="Q5177126" url="?curid=500819" title="Cadastral divisions of Victoria">
<text>Cadastral divisions in Victoria are called counties, which are further subdivided into parishes and townships, for cadastral or land administration purposes. Cadastral divisions of county, parish and township form the basis for formal identification of the location of any piece of land in the state. There are 37 counties and 2004 parishes and 909 townships. Parishes were subdivided into sections of various sizes for sale as farming allotments, or designated as a town and then divided into sections and these subdivided into crown allotments. However, many parishes do not follow county borders, some being located in more than one county.

Counties in Victoria, Australia were gazetted in stages between 1849 and 1871 as Victoria was progressively opened up to British settlement. All parish boundaries were gazetted by 1890.

In addition to identification of particular parcels of land by county, parish and other names, such parcels are also usually identified by reference to a lot number of a particular plan of subdivision or other certified plan or survey. Legal documents (such as grants, titles or transfers) that describe a particular parcel of land do so by reference to the county, parish, township (if there is one), section, crown allotment number, and certified plan number — for example: &quot;County of Dalhousie, Parish of Lauriston, being 2 hectares, being Crown Allotment 2, Section 40&quot;; or
&quot;Parish of Ballarat, County of Grant, Crown Allotment 29, Section 101, Township of Ballarat East, as shown on Certified Plan No. 105127&quot; Under streamlined rules of the Torrens title in Australia, a parcel of land on a transfer, etc. can now be described by reference to the relevant volume-folio number on the Land Register, which is itself based on the cadastral descriptions described above. When searching for title details, for example online, searching by street address is also often available. In each case, titles continue to be based on the original cadastral descriptions.

Unlike counties in the United States and the United Kingdom, Victoria&#x27;s counties have no administrative or political function. County names have traditionally been used as names for Victorian electoral districts, although the boundaries of these districts seldom coincided with county boundaries.

== History ==

Following the unauthorised settlement of settlers from Tasmania (then called Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) in the future Melbourne in 1835, in September 1836, Governor Bourke established the Port Phillip District of New South Wales. He also commissioned Robert Hoddle to make the first plan for the town. The plan was completed on 25 March 1837, and came to be known as the Hoddle Grid. The surveys were intended to prepare for land sales. The boundaries of the Port Phillip District were not settled until 1 July 1843, when a proclamation formalised the border as running from Cape Howe, to the nearest source of the Murray River, and then along the course of the Murray to the border with South Australia.

===Land districts===
Before the division of the Port Phillip District into counties, the colony was divided into land districts, as shown on an 1864 map. The land districts were used as the names for parts of the state where counties had yet to be proclaimed. The land districts included:

* Bourke Land District (Melbourne area, including the County of Bourke)
* Geelong (or Grant) Land District
* Gipps Land District (name for the area today is still Gippsland)
* Loddon Land District
* Murray Land District
* Normanby Land District 
* Western Land District
* Wimmera Land District (the southern part still called the Wimmera today)

===Proclamation of counties===
Counties were proclaimed or changed in 1849, 1853, 1869, 1870 and 1871. The proclamation of counties of 1849 was made while Port Phillip District was part of New South Wales, while the others were made after the separation from NSW in 1851, to create the colony of Victoria.

Earlier maps of Gippsland area in the eastern part of Victoria show proposed counties of Douro (a title of the Duke of Wellington), Bass, Haddington, Bruce, Abinger, Combermere and Howe with approximate boundaries. These counties are shown on several early maps such as an 1845 map and 1848 map. They were presumably changed in the mid-1860s, as they appear on maps up until 1864, but the new counties appear on an 1865 map.

In turn, all parish boundaries were gazetted by 1890. Historical parish plans and maps produced between 1837 and 1986, the majority of which have been digitised, are available online from the State Library Victoria.

== Naming of the counties ==
The majority of the counties proclaimed prior to 1871 were named after British politicians. The counties formed from the Gipps Land District, Loddon Land District, Murray Land District and Wimmera Land District proclaimed in 1871 were all given aboriginal names.

==List of Victorian counties==
The 37 Victorian counties and the year they were proclaimed are:
==Land administration==
Land Use Victoria is the Victorian Government&#x27;s key agency for land administration, property information and facilitating better use of government-owned land.

<text>Donnelly Drive ([[List of numbered routes in Ottawa|Ottawa Road #2]]) is a rural road in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The road runs along the western bank of the Rideau River from Burritts Rapids to Reevecraig Road South. Between these two points, Donnelly Drive passes through Becketts Landing and passes by Rideau River Provincial Park.

The eastern portion of Donnelly Drive was originally part of Ontario Highway 16. It runs along the Rideau Canal waterway, which was a major trade route in the early 1800s. It also runs close to the border of the city of Ottawa and the United Counties of Leeds And Grenville, which is the Rideau River.

Donnelly Drive turns into Heritage Road once it reaches Burritts Rapids.

<text>Heron Road (Ottawa Road #16) is a major road in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It runs from Walkley Road at an angle to the Rideau River, where it turns into Baseline Road. Heron is home to the Sir Leonard Tilley Building, the Canada Post headquarters, and 1500 Bronson Avenue (at its junction with Riverside Drive). It is also home to St. Patrick&#x27;s Intermediate High School and Herongate Mall.

Heron Road starts on the Heron Road Bridge which crosses the Rideau River, Rideau Canal, and part of Vincent Massey Park. From there, most of Heron Road is a four- to six-lane divided principal arterial, and often becomes a speed trap; the speed limit is west of Bank Street and east of Bank Street despite the overall lack of pedestrians and relatively free flow (especially west of Bronson Avenue).

<text>Bonavista (2021 population: 3,190) is a town on the Bonavista Peninsula, Newfoundland in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Unlike many Newfoundland coastal settlements, Bonavista was built on an open plain, not in a steep cove, and thus had room to expand to its current area of . Bonavista is located approximately 300 km by road from the provincial capital of St. John&#x27;s.

==History==
John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto), a freelance Italian explorer, was contracted by England&#x27;s Henry VII to find new lands, and a sea route to the Orient. Cabot set sail from Bristol, England in his ship the &quot;Matthew&quot; in 1497. When Cabot first saw land he reputedly said &quot;O Buon Vista&quot; (&quot;Oh, Happy Sight!&quot;) giving rise to the name of the town and nearby Cape Bonavista. Cabot landed with &quot;a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England&quot;. The land was inhabited, as the expedition found a trail leading inland, a site where a fire had been, and &quot;a stick half a yard long pierced at both ends, carved and painted with brazil&quot;.
The harbour was not ideal, eventually requiring the construction of several breakwaters. Despite this Bonavista became one of the most important towns in Newfoundland due to its proximity to the rich fishing and sealing grounds to the north of the peninsula. The Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French and English fished off Cape Bonavista during the 16th century, but the Spanish and Portuguese presence soon declined, leaving the French and English as the dominant powers. Tension between the French and English sometimes resulted in military action, including an unsuccessful attempt in 1704 by the French to burn the town. The French Shore, which had Bonavista as its eastern terminus, was established by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Fishing rights in the area continued to be a source of tension between the French and English.

Bonavista was a major commercial centre and the evidence for this is preserved at the Ryan Premises, a National Historic Site maintained by Parks Canada. It is a restored example of a large fish merchant&#x27;s operation.

Bonavista&#x27;s status was further enhanced by the development of the Fishermen&#x27;s Protective Union in the early 20th century, and the creation of nearby Port Union. During the peak years of 1891–1901, the Bonavista Peninsula&#x27;s population of about 20,000 was centred in Bonavista. The Bonavista Cold Storage Co. fish plant, now a Fishery Products International operation, became the centre of fishery production after the decline of salt fish markets.

In 1722, the first school in Newfoundland was built in Bonavista by Rev. Henry Jones.

In 1964 the settlement of Bonavista was incorporated into the town of Bonavista. 

In 2010, discussions were held about the potential annexation of Elliston by Bonavista. The proposal arose from concerns about the economic sustainability and administrative challenges of smaller municipalities in the region. A feasibility study was conducted to explore the benefits and drawbacks of merging services and governance. However, the idea was met with mixed reactions from residents, and the annexation did not proceed. Elliston continues to operate as an independent municipality.

In the 20th century, the town&#x27;s economy switched to being tourism-focused. In 2023, it was reported that up to 80,000 visited each summer, leading to many houses to be converted into vacation rentals (more than 120 in 2023). These conversions flipped the housing market of the house, which twenty years earlier had seen many vacant houses, into one of shortage. As of 2023 a freeze on new vacation rental conversions was declared.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Bonavista had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Climate==
Bonavista has a subarctic climate (Dfc) due to its cold water temperatures surrounding the location, keeping June temperatures below in terms of mean temperatures. Although winters are relatively mild by Canadian standards, there is heavy snowfall and frequent cold days. Winter lasts from December through April.

Bonavista is one of the windiest places in Canada with an average wind speed of .

==Personal data==
He was born April 11, 1941, in Long Beach, California, but considers Winchester, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. to be his hometowns. His parents were the late Captain and Mrs. Phillip F. Hauck. His maternal grandfather, Olaf M. Hustvedt, was a United States Navy vice admiral who commanded battleships during World War II. As a child, Hauck was suggested to skip first and second grade. However, his mother felt concerned about the age difference between him and his fellow classmates and instead only had him skip first grade. Hauck married his first wife, Dolly Bowman, in 1962. The couple had two children. The couple split on amicable terms in the late 1980s. Hauck is married to Susan Cameron Bruce.

==Education==

* 1966: Received a Master of Science degree in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
* 1971: Graduated U.S. Naval Test Pilot School

==Military experience==
Hauck, a Naval ROTC student at Tufts University, was commissioned upon graduation in 1962 and reported to the destroyer , where he served 20 months as communications officer and Combat Information Center officer. Hauck was involved in the search for the submarine USS &quot;Thresher&quot; when it sank off the coast of Cape Cod in 1963. In 1964, he attended the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, for studies in mathematics and physics and for a brief time in 1965 studied the Russian language at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey. Selected for the Navy&#x27;s Advanced Science Program, he received a master&#x27;s degree in nuclear engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology the next year.

He commenced flight training at the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, in 1966, and was designated a Naval Aviator, receiving his aviator wings in 1968. As a pilot with Attack Squadron 35 he deployed to the Western Pacific with Carrier Air Wing Fifteen aboard the aircraft carrier , flying 114 combat and combat support missions in the A-6 Intruder. In August 1970, Hauck joined Attack Squadron 42 as a visual weapons delivery instructor in the A-6 Intruder. Selected for test pilot training, he reported to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland in 1971. A 3-year tour in the Naval Air Test Center&#x27;s Carrier Suitability Branch of the Flight Test Division followed. During this period, Hauck served as a project test pilot for automatic carrier landing systems in the RA-5 Vigilante, A-6 Intruder, A-7 Corsair II, F-4 Phantom and F-14 Tomcat aircraft and was team leader for the Navy Board of Inspection and Survey aircraft carrier trials of the F-14. In 1974, he reported as operations officer to commander, Carrier Air Wing Fourteen aboard . On two cruises he flew the A-6, A-7, and F-14 during both day and night carrier operations. He reported to Attack Squadron 145 as Executive Officer in February 1977.

In May 1989 he became director, Navy Space Systems Division, in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. In this capacity he held budgeting responsibility for the Navy&#x27;s space programs. Captain Hauck left military active duty on June 1, 1990.

==NASA experience==
NASA selected Hauck as an astronaut candidate in January 1978. He made an early impression on his fellow astronauts in his first days. Being one of the new TFNGs to sit at the table during his first morning astronaut meeting. Some thought he was either a fool or the most confident among the new candidates. He was assistant Crimson team CAPCOM for the first Space Shuttle mission re-entry. His first spaceflight was as pilot for STS-7, the seventh flight of the Space Shuttle, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 18, 1983. The crew included Robert Crippen (spacecraft commander), and three mission specialists, John Fabian, Sally Ride, and Norm Thagard. This was the second flight for the orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; and the first mission with a 5-person crew. During the mission, the STS-7 crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK-C2) and Indonesia (Palapa B-1); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise (with the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01)); and with Crippen conducted the first piloting of the orbiter in close proximity to a free-flying satellite (SPAS-01). Mission duration was 147 hours before landing on a lakebed runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1983.

Hauck was spacecraft commander for the second mission of &quot;Discovery&quot; on mission STS-51-A, which launched on November 8, 1984. His crew included David M. Walker (astronaut) (pilot), and three mission specialists, Joseph Allen, Anna Fisher, and Dale Gardner. During the mission, the crew deployed two satellites, Telesat Canada&#x27;s Anik D-2, and Hughes&#x27; LEASAT-1 (Syncom IV-1). In the first space salvage mission in history, the crew also retrieved for return to Earth the Palapa B-2 and Westar VI satellites. STS-51-A completed 127 orbits of the Earth before landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 16, 1984.

In March 1985 Captain Hauck became the Astronaut Office project officer for the integration of the liquid-fueled Shuttle-Centaur upper-stage rocket. In May 1985 he was named commander of the Centaur-boosted &quot;Ulysses&quot; solar probe mission, STS-61-F (sponsored by the European Space Agency). It was set to launch in a tight launch window in May 1986. After the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident this mission was postponed, and the Shuttle-Centaur project was terminated.

In August 1986, Captain Hauck was appointed NASA associate administrator for external relations, the policy advisor to the NASA Administrator for congressional, public, international, inter-governmental, and educational affairs. He resumed his astronaut duties at the Johnson Space Center in early February 1987.

Hauck was spacecraft commander of &quot;Discovery&quot; on STS-26, the first flight to be flown after the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. The mission launched on September 29, 1988. The flight crew included the pilot, Richard Covey, and three mission specialists, David Hilmers, Mike Lounge, and George Nelson. During the four-day mission, the crew deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C) and operated eleven mid-deck experiments. While in command of the flight, Hauck and the rest of the crew took time to honor those lost on Challenger. Hauck offered words of honor to his fallen friends, &quot;Dear friends, we have resumed the journey that we promised to continue for you. Dear friends, your loss has meant that we could confidently begin anew. Dear friends, your spirit and your dreams are still alive in our heart.&quot; &quot;Discovery&quot; completed 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988.

Hauck has logged over 5,500 flight hours, 436 in space.

==Post-NASA experience==
In October 1990, he joined AXA Space (formerly INTEC) as president and chief operating officer, and on January 1, 1993, assumed responsibilities as chief executive officer. AXA Space provides property and casualty insurance for the risk of launching and operating satellites. He retired from AXA Space in April 2005. Hauck was added to the board of directors for Cianbro, a Maine-based construction company, in 2010.

After his divorce from Dolly Bowman, Hauck began dating Susan Bruce, a former Tufts student he knew during his senior year. They married in 1993. Hauck inherited three stepdaughters from Susan&#x27;s previous marriage.

In December 2023, Hauck published his memoir &quot;To Mach 25 and Home&quot;.

<text>An agonist is a chemical that activates a receptor to produce a biological response. Receptors are cellular proteins whose activation causes the cell to modify what it is currently doing. In contrast, an antagonist blocks the action of the agonist, while an inverse agonist causes an action opposite to that of the agonist.

== Etymology ==
The word originates from the Greek word &#x27; (agōnistēs), contestant; champion; rival &lt; &#x27; (agōn), contest, combat; exertion, struggle &lt; (agō), I lead, lead towards, conduct; drive.

== Types of agonists == 

Receptors can be activated by either endogenous agonists (such as hormones and neurotransmitters) or exogenous agonists (such as drugs), resulting in a biological response. A physiological agonist is a substance that creates the same bodily responses but does not bind to the same receptor.

* An endogenous agonist for a particular receptor is a compound naturally produced by the body that binds to and activates that receptor. For example, the endogenous agonist for serotonin receptors is serotonin, and the endogenous agonist for dopamine receptors is dopamine.
* Full agonists bind to and activate a receptor with the maximum response that an agonist can elicit at the receptor. One example of a drug that can act as a full agonist is isoproterenol, which mimics the action of adrenaline at β adrenoreceptors. Another example is morphine, which mimics the actions of endorphins at μ-opioid receptors throughout the central nervous system. However, a drug can act as a full agonist in some tissues and as a partial agonist in other tissues, depending upon the relative numbers of receptors and differences in receptor coupling.
* A co-agonist works with other co-agonists to produce the desired effect together. NMDA receptor activation requires the binding of both glutamate, glycine and D-serine co-agonists. Calcium can also act as a co-agonist at the IP3 receptor.
* A selective agonist is selective for a specific type of receptor. E.g. buspirone is a selective agonist for serotonin 5-HT1A.
* Partial agonists (such as buspirone, aripiprazole, buprenorphine, or norclozapine) also bind and activate a given receptor, but have only partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist, even at maximal receptor occupancy. Agents like buprenorphine are used to treat opiate dependence for this reason, as they produce milder effects on the opioid receptor with lower dependence and abuse potential.
* An inverse agonist is an agent that binds to the same receptor binding-site as an agonist for that receptor and inhibits the constitutive activity of the receptor. Inverse agonists exert the opposite pharmacological effect of a receptor agonist, not merely an absence of the agonist effect as seen with an antagonist. An example is the cannabinoid inverse agonist rimonabant.
* A superagonist is a term used by some to identify a compound that is capable of producing a greater response than the endogenous agonist for the target receptor. It might be argued that the endogenous agonist is simply a partial agonist in that tissue.
* An irreversible agonist is a type of agonist that binds permanently to a receptor through the formation of covalent bonds.
* A biased agonist is an agent that binds to a receptor without affecting the same signal transduction pathway. Oliceridine is a μ-opioid receptor agonist that has been described to be functionally selective towards G protein and away from β-arrestin2 pathways.

New findings that broaden the conventional definition of pharmacology demonstrate that ligands can concurrently behave as agonist &quot;and&quot; antagonists at the same receptor, depending on effector pathways or tissue type. Terms that describe this phenomenon are &quot;functional selectivity&quot;, &quot;protean agonism&quot;, or selective receptor modulators.

== Mechanism of action ==
As mentioned above, agonists have the potential to bind in different locations and in different ways depending on the type of agonist and the type of receptor. The process of binding is unique to the receptor-agonist relationship, but binding induces a conformational change and activates the receptor. This conformational change is often the result of small changes in charge or changes in protein folding when the agonist is bound. Two examples that demonstrate this process are the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and NMDA receptor and their respective agonists.

For the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor(GPCR), the endogenous agonist is acetylcholine. The binding of this neurotransmitter causes the conformational changes that propagate a signal into the cell. The conformational changes are the primary effect of the agonist, and are related to the agonist&#x27;s binding affinity and agonist efficacy. Other agonists that bind to this receptor will fall under one of the different categories of agonist mentioned above based on their specific binding affinity and efficacy.

The NMDA receptor is an example of an alternate mechanism of action, as the NMDA receptor requires co-agonists for activation. Rather than simply requiring a single specific agonist, the NMDA receptor requires both the endogenous agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and glycine. These co-agonists are both required to induce the conformational change needed for the NMDA receptor to allow flow through the ion channel, in this case calcium. An aspect demonstrated by the NMDA receptor is that the mechanism or response of agonists can be blocked by a variety of chemical and biological factors. NMDA receptors specifically are blocked by a magnesium ion unless the cell is also experiencing depolarization.

These differences show that agonists have unique mechanisms of action depending on the receptor activated and the response needed. The goal and process remains generally consistent however, with the primary mechanism of action requiring the binding of the agonist and the subsequent changes in conformation to cause the desired response at the receptor. This response as discussed above can vary from allowing flow of ions to activating a GPCR and transmitting a signal into the cell.

== Activity ==
=== Potency ===
Potency is the amount of agonist needed to elicit a desired response. The potency of an agonist is inversely related to its half maximal effective concentration (EC50) value. The EC50 can be measured for a given agonist by determining the concentration of agonist needed to elicit half of the maximum biological response of the agonist. The EC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies producing physiologically similar effects. The smaller the EC50 value, the greater the potency of the agonist, the lower the concentration of drug that is required to elicit the maximum biological response.

=== Therapeutic index ===
When a drug is used therapeutically, it is important to understand the margin of safety that exists between the dose needed for the desired effect and the dose that produces unwanted and possibly dangerous side-effects (measured by the TD50, the dose that produces toxicity in 50% of individuals). This relationship, termed the therapeutic index, is defined as the ratio TD50:ED50. In general, the narrower this margin, the more likely it is that the drug will produce unwanted effects. The therapeutic index emphasizes the importance of the margin of safety, as distinct from the potency, in determining the usefulness of a drug.

<doc id="500892" wikidata="Q1320276" url="?curid=500892" title="Hypovolemia">
<text>Hypovolemia, also known as volume depletion or volume contraction, is a state of abnormally low extracellular fluid in the body. This may be due to either a loss of both salt and water or a decrease in blood volume. Hypovolemia refers to the loss of extracellular fluid and should not be confused with dehydration.

Hypovolemia is caused by a variety of events, but these can be simplified into two categories: those that are associated with kidney function and those that are not. The signs and symptoms of hypovolemia worsen as the amount of fluid lost increases. Immediately or shortly after mild fluid loss (from blood donation, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding from trauma, etc.), one may experience headache, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, or thirst. Untreated hypovolemia or excessive and rapid losses of volume may lead to hypovolemic shock. Signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock include increased heart rate, low blood pressure, pale or cold skin, and altered mental status. When these signs are seen, immediate action should be taken to restore the lost volume.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of hypovolemia progress with increased loss of fluid volume.

Early symptoms of hypovolemia include headache, fatigue, weakness, thirst, and dizziness. The more severe signs and symptoms are often associated with hypovolemic shock. These include oliguria, cyanosis, abdominal and chest pain, hypotension, tachycardia, cold hands and feet, and progressively altering mental status.

==Causes==
The causes of hypovolemia can be characterized into two categories:

===Kidney===
* Loss of body sodium and consequent intravascular water (due to impaired reabsorption of salt and water in the tubules of the kidneys)
** Osmotic diuresis: the increase in urine production due to an excess of osmotic (namely glucose and urea) load in the tubules of the kidneys
** Overuse of pharmacologic diuretics
** Impaired response to hormones controlling salt and water balance (see mineralocorticoids)
** Impaired kidney function due to tubular injury or other diseases

===Other===
* Loss of bodily fluids due to:
** Gastrointestinal losses; e.g. vomiting and diarrhea
** Skin losses; e.g. excessive sweating and burns
** Respiratory losses; e.g. hyperventilation (breathing fast)
* Build up of fluid in empty spaces (third spaces) of the body due to:
** Acute pancreatitis
** Intestinal obstruction
** Increase in vascular permeability
** Dysautonomia such as Vasovagal syncope or POTS Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
** Hypoalbuminemia
* Loss of blood (external or internal bleeding or blood donation)

== Pathophysiology ==
The signs and symptoms of hypovolemia are primarily due to the consequences of decreased circulating volume and a subsequent reduction in the amount of blood reaching the tissues of the body. In order to properly perform their functions, tissues require the oxygen transported in the blood. A decrease in circulating volume can lead to a decrease in bloodflow to the brain, resulting in headache and dizziness.

Baroreceptors in the body (primarily those located in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch) sense the reduction of circulating fluid and send signals to the brain to increase sympathetic response (&quot;see also: baroreflex&quot;). This sympathetic response is to release epinephrine and norepinephrine, which results in peripheral vasoconstriction (reducing size of blood vessels) in order to conserve the circulating fluids for organs vital to survival (i.e. brain and heart). Peripheral vasoconstriction accounts for the cold extremities (hands and feet), increased heart rate, increased cardiac output (and associated chest pain). Eventually, there will be less perfusion to the kidneys, resulting in decreased urine output.

==Diagnosis==
Hypovolemia can be recognized by a fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and the absence of perfusion as assessed by skin signs (skin turning pale) and/or capillary refill on forehead, lips and nail beds. The patient may feel dizzy, faint, nauseated, or very thirsty. These signs are also characteristic of most types of shock.

In children, compensation can result in an artificially high blood pressure despite hypovolemia (a decrease in blood volume). Children typically are able to compensate (maintain blood pressure despite hypovolemia) for a longer period than adults, but deteriorate rapidly and severely once they are unable to compensate (decompensate). Consequently, any possibility of internal bleeding in children should be treated aggressively.

Signs of external bleeding should be assessed, noting that individuals can bleed internally without external blood loss or otherwise apparent signs.

There should be considered possible mechanisms of injury that may have caused internal bleeding, such as ruptured or bruised internal organs. If trained to do so and if the situation permits, there should be conducted a secondary survey and checked the chest and abdomen for pain, deformity, guarding, discoloration or swelling. Bleeding into the abdominal cavity can cause the classical bruising patterns of Grey Turner&#x27;s sign (bruising along the sides) or Cullen&#x27;s sign (around the navel).

===Examination===
In a hospital, physicians respond to a case of hypovolemic shock by conducting these examinations:
* Blood tests: U+Es/Chem7, full blood count, glucose, blood type and screen
* Central venous catheter
* Arterial line
* Urine output measurements (via urinary catheter)
* Blood pressure
* SpO2 oxygen saturation monitoring

===Stages===
Untreated hypovolemia can lead to shock (see also: hypovolemic shock). Most sources state that there are 4 stages of hypovolemia and subsequent shock; however, a number of other systems exist with as many as 6 stages.

The 4 stages are sometimes known as the &quot;Tennis&quot; staging of hypovolemic shock, as the stages of blood loss (under 15% of volume, 15–30% of volume, 30–40% of volume and above 40% of volume) mimic the scores in a game of tennis: 15, 15–30, 30–40 and 40. It is basically the same as used in classifying bleeding by blood loss.

The signs and symptoms of the major stages of hypovolemic shock include:

==Treatment==

===Field care===
The most important step in treatment of hypovolemic shock is to identify and control the source of bleeding.

Medical personnel should immediately supply emergency oxygen to increase efficiency of the patient&#x27;s remaining blood supply. This intervention can be life-saving.

Also, the respiratory pump is especially important during hypovolemia as spontaneous breathing may help reduce the effect of this loss of blood pressure on stroke volume by increasing venous return.

The use of intravenous fluids (IVs) may help compensate for lost fluid volume, but IV fluids cannot carry oxygen the way blood does—however, researchers are developing blood substitutes that can. Infusing colloid or crystalloid IV fluids also dilutes clotting factors in the blood, increasing the risk of bleeding. Current best practice allow permissive hypotension in patients with hypovolemic shock, both avoid overly diluting clotting factors and avoid artificially raising blood pressure to a point where it &quot;blows off&quot; clots that have formed.

===Hospital treatment===
Fluid replacement is beneficial in hypovolemia of stage 2, and is necessary in stage 3 and 4. See also the discussion of shock and the importance of treating reversible shock while it can still be countered.

The following interventions are carried out:
* IV access
* Oxygen as required
* Fresh frozen plasma or blood transfusion
* Surgical repair at sites of bleeding

Vasopressors (such as dopamine and noradrenaline) should generally be avoided, as they may result in further tissue ischemia and don&#x27;t correct the primary problem. Fluids are the preferred choice of therapy.

==History==
In cases where loss of blood volume is clearly attributable to bleeding (as opposed to, e.g., dehydration), most medical practitioners prefer the term &quot;exsanguination&quot; for its greater specificity and descriptiveness, with the effect that the latter term is now more common in the relevant context.

<text>This is a list of hospitals in Pennsylvania, a U.S. state. The list includes only hospitals that are currently licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Health or operated by the Veterans Health Administration, according to data collected by the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) and the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

As of July 2018, there were 249 state licensed hospitals and VA hospital facilities in Pennsylvania. 148 of these facilities were non-profit, 86 were for-profit or &quot;investor-owned&quot;, and 15 were public hospitals owned by the Federal government, state government, or in one case, the city of Philadelphia. There were 42,817 total licensed beds and 1,880 total operating rooms. 156 were general acute hospitals (with 10 more classified as general acute specialty hospitals), 29 were psychiatric hospitals, 22 were long-term acute care hospitals, 21 were rehabilitation hospitals, and 7 were VA hospitals. The largest hospital by both beds and operating rooms was UPMC Presbyterian-Shadyside in Pittsburgh. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) was also the largest health system network in the state by number of hospitals (28), beds (7,022), and operating rooms (379).

==Hospitals in Pennsylvania==
The following list is initially sorted alphabetically and can be sorted by additional categories. Hospital names are the latest as provided to HAP in their July 2018 dataset and may not reflect the current name or the name used by the hospital for marketing purposes. See the Notes column for additional information.

==Hospitals planned or under construction==

The following list of new hospitals are those that have been announced as planned or are currently under construction as of August 28, 2019. This list represents new hospital locations or campuses and does not include the expansion or replacement of existing hospital facilities.
