<text>Between the 1890s and 1940s, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) built a series of battleships as it expanded its fleet. Previously, the Empire of Japan had acquired a few ironclad warships from foreign builders, although it had adopted the naval doctrine which emphasized cheap torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armored ships. To counter the Beiyang Fleet of Imperial China in the early 1890s, however, Japan ordered two s from Great Britain as Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own vessels. Combat experience in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 convinced the IJN that its doctrine was untenable, leading to a ten-year naval construction program that called for a total of six battleships and six armored cruisers (the Six-Six Fleet). The two ships of the and the battleships and were also purchased from Great Britain. Aware that they could not outbuild the Americans or British, the IJN decided that their ships would always be qualitatively superior to offset their quantitative inferiority.

To counter reinforcement of the Russian Empire&#x27;s Pacific Squadron as tensions rose between the Russians and the Japanese over control of Korea and Manchuria in the early 1900s, Japan ordered the two battleships of the in 1903, the last battleships ordered from abroad. To preempt further reinforcements before their own ships were completed, they began the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 with a surprise attack on the Russian base at Port Arthur. Shortly after the war began, the IJN ordered the two ships of the , the first battleships to be built in Japan. The Imperial Japanese Army captured Port Arthur, along with the surviving ships of the Pacific Squadron by the end of the year. The Russians had dispatched the bulk of their Baltic Fleet to relieve Port Arthur, which reached the Korea Strait in May 1905 and was virtually annihilated by the IJN in the Battle of Tsushima. During the war, Japan captured a total of five Russian pre-dreadnought battleships. They were repaired and commissioned into the Japanese fleet, and two were later sold back to Russia during World War I, as Japan and Russia were by then allies. The magnitude of the victory at Tsushima caused the leadership of the IJN to believe that a surface engagement between the main fleets was the only decisive battle in modern warfare and would be decided by battleships armed with the largest guns.

After the war, the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean, Britain and the United States, believing that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals. Accordingly, the 1907 Imperial Defense Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships and eight battlecruisers. This was the genesis of the Eight-Eight Fleet Program, the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships. The launch of in 1906 and the battlecruiser the following year by the Royal Navy raised the stakes and complicated Japan&#x27;s plans as they rendered all existing battleships and armored cruisers obsolete, forcing Japan to restart the Eight-Eight plan with dreadnought battleships and battlecruisers. This began with the in 1907, followed by the and es in the 1910s. Japan ordered its seventh and eighth dreadnoughts with the in 1916 and 1917.

In 1919, American president Woodrow Wilson announced the resumption of the 1916 naval construction program and the Japanese ordered eight fast battleships of the and es in response. The prospect of a new massively expensive arms race between the United States, Britain and Japan after the war caused the three powers to agree to the Washington Naval Treaty which limited Japan to a ratio of 3:5:5 in battleship tonnage to the United States and Britain. The treaty forced the IJN to dispose of all of its pre-dreadnoughts and the oldest dreadnoughts; the ships then under construction had to be broken up or sunk as targets. Furthermore, the treaty mandated a building holiday that barred the construction of new battleships for ten years. During this period, opponents of the Washington Naval Treaty and its successors had taken control of the upper echelons of the IJN and rebuilt the s into fast battleships and modernized the existing ships. Coupled with the growth of ultranationalism and dominance of the government by the military, the government decided to withdraw from the treaty regime when it expired in 1936. Planning by the Navy General Staff for the post-treaty era began in 1934 and included five large battleships armed with nine guns; these ships became the . While the &quot;Yamato&quot;s were under construction in the late 1930s, the IJN began designing a successor class, the Design A-150 armed with guns, but never laid any down as they prepared for war and other ships had higher priority.

==Pre-dreadnoughts==

===&quot;Fuji&quot; class===

The two ships, and , were the IJN&#x27;s first battleships, ordered from Britain in response to two new German-built Chinese ironclad warships. The ships were designed as smaller versions of the British , although they were slightly faster and had a better type of armor.

As part of the 1st Fleet the &quot;Fuji&quot;s participated in fighting off Port Arthur on 9–10 March 1904, wherein &quot;Fuji&quot; sustained light damage and &quot;Yashima&quot; was undamaged. On 15 May &quot;Yashima&quot; struck two naval mines and foundered. &quot;Fuji&quot; participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August and was then slightly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. She was credited with the shot that caused the magazine explosion that destroyed the battleship . In October 1908, &quot;Fuji&quot; hosted the American ambassador to Japan and some senior officers of the Great White Fleet, and was later reclassified as a coast defense ship in 1910. The ship was disarmed and converted into an accommodation ship in 1922. &quot;Fuji&quot; was sunk by American aircraft in 1945 and scrapped in 1948.

===&quot;Shikishima&quot; class===

The was designed as a more powerful version of the Royal Navy&#x27;s battleship. The ships were also assigned to the 1st Fleet before the Russo–Japanese War, were present at the Battle of Port Arthur and were slightly damaged during the action. struck one of the mines that the Russians laid in May 1904 and sank following a magazine explosion. &quot;Shikishima&quot; fought in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, only being damaged by a misfiring 12-inch shell, and then participated in the Battle of Tsushima where she was hit nine times, suffered another misfire from one of her main guns, and, together with the battleship , sank the Russian battleship . &quot;Shikishima&quot; spent the duration of World War I assigned to the Sasebo Naval District, and was demilitarized after the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922. She was used as a training hulk at Sasebo until she was broken up in 1948.

===&quot;Asahi&quot;===

&quot;Asahi&quot; was a slightly improved version of the British s. She became the flagship of the IJN&#x27;s Standing Fleet and was later assigned to the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet reformed in 1903. At the start of the Russo–Japanese War, &quot;Asahi&quot; took part in the Battle of Port Arthur and was not damaged by Russian fire. At the Battle of the Yellow Sea, the ship was moderately damaged, although she hit and damaged and in return. &quot;Asahi&quot; struck a mine two months later near Port Arthur, but was repaired in time for the Battle of Tsushima. There, she helped disable the battleship and dueled with the battleships &quot;Borodino&quot; and , taking no damage.

She was a gunnery training ship for most of World War I until being rearmed in 1917 in time to escort troop transports during Japan&#x27;s intervention in the Russian Civil War. &quot;Asahi&quot; was converted into a noncombat vessel during the 1920s and was then made a repair ship in 1937. On the night of 25–26 May 1942, &quot;Asahi&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine off modern-day Vietnam.

===&quot;Mikasa&quot;===

&quot;Mikasa&quot; was also an improved version of the &quot;Formidable&quot;-class battleships and only differed in minor respects from &quot;Asahi&quot;. The ship served as the 1st Fleet flagship throughout the Russo-Japanese War. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war and the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima. During the latter battle, the ship was hit many times, but was only lightly damaged. Days after the end of the war, &quot;Mikasa&quot;″s magazine accidentally exploded and sank the ship. She was salvaged and her repairs took over two years to complete. Afterward, the ship served as a coast-defense ship during World War I and supported Japanese forces when they intervened in the Russian Civil War. After the Washington Naval Treaty was ratified in 1922 &quot;Mikasa&quot; was preserved as a museum ship. She was badly neglected during the post–World War II occupation of Japan and required extensive refurbishing in the late 1950s, but has only partially been restored. &quot;Mikasa&quot; is the only surviving example of a pre-dreadnought battleship in the world.

===&quot;Tango&quot;===

&quot;Tango&quot; was laid down as the Russian battleship &quot;Poltava&quot; (), the second of three pre-dreadnought battleships. The ship was assigned to the Pacific Squadron shortly after her completion and based at Port Arthur from 1901. During the Russo-Japanese War, she participated in the Battle of Port Arthur and was heavily damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Sunk by Japanese artillery during the subsequent Siege of Port Arthur in December 1904, she was refloated by the IJN after the war and subsequently renamed &quot;Tango&quot;. During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications during the Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese government sold &quot;Tango&quot; back to the Russians in 1916. She was renamed &quot;Chesma&quot; () as her former name had been given to a new ship. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but saw no action in the Russian Civil War owing to her poor condition, and she was ultimately scrapped in 1924.

===&quot;Sagami&quot; and &quot;Suwo&quot;===

&quot;Sagami&quot; and &quot;Suwo&quot; were originally the Russian battleships () and () respectively. The design of the &quot;Peresvet&quot; class was inspired by the British second-class battleships of the . The British ships were intended to defeat commerce-raiding armored cruisers like the Russian ships and , and the &quot;Peresvet&quot; class was designed to support their armored cruisers.

The sisters were sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur and were salvaged by the IJN afterward. Because of their lighter armament than the other captured battleships, they were rated as coastal-defense ships. During World War I, &quot;Suwo&quot; was the flagship of the Japanese squadron during the Siege of Tsingtao and then of the 2nd Fleet before becoming a gunnery-training ship in 1916. &quot;Sagami&quot; was sold back to the Russians that same year and resumed her former name. While en route to northern Russia, the ship struck two mines in the Mediterranean and sank. &quot;Suwo&quot; was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and was probably scrapped afterward.

===&quot;Hizen&quot;===

&quot;Hizen&quot;, originally &quot;Retvizan&quot; (), was a Russian pre-dreadnought battleship built in America before the Russo-Japanese War because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity. The ship was torpedoed during the Battle of Port Arthur, but was repaired in time to participate in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, during which she was lightly damaged. She was sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur and salvaged by the IJN. During World War I, &quot;Hizen&quot; was sent to reinforce the weak British squadron off British Columbia, but diverted to Hawaii after reports of a German gunboat there were received. The ship was unsuccessfully sent to search for other German ships after the Americans interned the gunboat in November 1914. After the war she supported the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War and was disarmed in 1922 as required by the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. &quot;Hizen&quot; was sunk as a target in 1924.

===&quot;Iwami&quot;===

&quot;Iwami&quot; was built shortly before the Russo-Japanese War for the Imperial Russian Navy as &quot;Oryol&quot; (), one of five s. Together with three of her sisters, she voyaged half-way around the world to participate in the Battle of Tsushima. Moderately damaged during the battle, the ship was surrendered to the IJN the following day. The Japanese rebuilt her from 1905 to 1907 and she was assigned to the 1st Fleet, although the ship was reclassified as a coast defense ship in 1912. &quot;Iwami&quot; participated in the Siege of Tsingtao in 1914 after Japan declared war on Imperial Germany and then became a guardship. She became the flagship of the 5th Division of the 3rd Fleet in 1918 and supported the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War. &quot;Iwami&quot; briefly became a training ship before she was disarmed in 1922 and was sunk as a target two years later.

===&quot;Katori&quot; class===

The pair of &quot;Katori&quot;-class pre-dreadnoughts were the last Japanese battleships to be built overseas. The design of the &quot;Katori&quot; class was a modified and improved version of the Royal Navy&#x27;s battleships. Completed after the end of the Russo–Japanese War, the ships never saw combat. &quot;Katori&quot; had a major fire in one of her secondary-gun turrets in 1907 that killed 34 men and wounded 8 others. While they saw no action during World War I, they both participated in Japan&#x27;s intervention in Siberia in 1918. In 1921, the sisters carried Crown Prince Hirohito on his tour of Europe where he met King George V. Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, both ships were disarmed and scrapped between 1923 and 1925.

===&quot;Satsuma&quot; class===

The &quot;Satsuma&quot;-class battleships, &quot;Satsuma&quot; and &quot;Aki&quot;, were the first battleships to be built in Japan. They marked a transitional stage in battleship design, as the sisters were intended to mount a dozen guns. Material shortages in Japan and the expense of construction led to a redesign that armed the sisters with four 12-inch and a dozen guns. If built as planned, the &quot;Satsuma&quot; class would have been the world&#x27;s first &quot;all big-gun&quot; battleships. &quot;Satsuma&quot; was powered traditionally with two vertical triple-expansion engines, but &quot;Aki&quot; was the first Japanese battleship to use steam turbines.

The introduction of in 1906 ensured that the &quot;Satsuma&quot; class was obsolete before the ships were even launched. Nevertheless, &quot;Aki&quot; was launched on 15 November, while &quot;Satsuma&quot; followed on 15 April 1907. &quot;Satsuma&quot; would go on to serve as Rear Admiral Tatsuo Matsumura&#x27;s flagship in the Second South Seas Squadron as it seized the German possessions of the Caroline and the Palau Islands in October 1914 in the opening months of World War I. &quot;Satsuma&quot; would later be refitted at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in 1916 and served with the 1st Squadron for the rest of the war. &quot;Aki&quot; was also assigned to the 1st Squadron until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918. Both ships were sunk as targets by and in 1924.

==Dreadnought battleships==
===&quot;Kawachi&quot; class===

The , &quot;Kawachi&quot; and &quot;Settsu&quot;, were a pair of dreadnought battleships ordered in the Navy&#x27;s Warship Supplement Program after the Russo-Japanese War. They were the IJN&#x27;s first dreadnoughts and marked one of the first steps in achieving Japan&#x27;s recently adopted Eight-Eight Fleet Program. The sisters were armed with four 50-caliber 12-inch and eight 45-caliber 12-inch main guns, arranged in the hexagonal layout used by the German dreadnoughts of the and es. They had originally been designed with a dozen 45-caliber guns, but after the IJN received word that the Royal Navy had adopted the more powerful and expensive 50-caliber guns, it upgraded the four centerline guns to the longer caliber as it could not afford to upgrade all of them.

&quot;Settsu&quot; and &quot;Kawachi&quot; bombarded German fortifications at Tsingtao during the Battle of Tsingtao in 1914, but saw no other combat in World War I. &quot;Kawachi&quot; sank in 1918 after an explosion in her ammunition magazine with the loss of over 600 officers and crewmen. &quot;Settsu&quot; was disarmed in 1922 and converted into a target ship. She was heavily damaged in 1945 by American carrier aircraft and eventually beached to avoid sinking. The ship was subsequently scrapped in 1946–1947.

===&quot;Fusō&quot; class===

The , &quot;Fusō&quot; and &quot;Yamashiro&quot;, were a pair of dreadnoughts built for the IJN during World War I. Both patrolled briefly off the coast of China before being placed in reserve at the war&#x27;s end. Although they were extensively modernized during the 1930s, the sisters were considered obsolescent by the eve of World War II, and neither saw significant action in its early years. &quot;Fusō&quot; and &quot;Yamashiro&quot; briefly served as troop transports in 1943, but mostly served as training ships that year. They were the only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and were sunk by torpedoes and naval gunfire during the night battle with the loss of almost all of their crews.

===&quot;Ise&quot; class===

The were another pair of dreadnoughts built during World War I. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. They were modernized in the interwar period with improvements to their armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style. Afterward they played a minor role in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Despite the expensive reconstructions, both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War, and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war. Following the loss of most of the IJN&#x27;s large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid-1942, they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes. A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots, however, meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat. While awaiting their air group, the sister ships were occasionally used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases. They participated in the Battle off Cape Engaño in late 1944, where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches. Afterward, both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita, where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan. The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July. After the war, they were scrapped in 1946–1947.

===&quot;Nagato&quot; class===

The were the third pair of dreadnoughts built during World War I, although they were not completed until after the end of the war. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. Modernized during the 1930s, &quot;Nagato&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Mutsu&quot; briefly participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and &quot;Nagato&quot; was the flagship of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 that began the Pacific War.

The sisters participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, although they did not see any combat. &quot;Mutsu&quot; participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August before returning to Japan in early 1943. One of her magazines exploded in June, destroying the ship. &quot;Nagato&quot; spent most of the first two years of the war training in home waters. She was transferred to Truk in mid-1943, but did not see any combat until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. &quot;Nagato&quot; did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month for repairs. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. &quot;Nagato&quot; was converted into a floating anti-aircraft platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. After the war, the ship was a target for US nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads in mid-1946. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second test.

===&quot;Tosa&quot; class===
The were ordered during the early 1920s. They were larger versions of the preceding &quot;Nagato&quot; class, and carried an additional twin-gun 41 cm turret. Both ships were launched in late 1921, but the first ship, , was cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty before she could be completed, and was used in experiments testing the effectiveness of its armor scheme before being scuttled. The hull of the second ship, , was converted into an aircraft carrier to replace an that had been wrecked by the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923. The carrier supported Japanese troops in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War and took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, during the Dutch East Indies campaign. She was sunk during the Battle of Midway in 1942.

===&quot;Kii&quot; class===
The &quot;Kii&quot;-class battleship was a planned class of four fast battleships to be built during the 1920s. Only two of the ships received names. They were intended to reinforce Japan&#x27;s &quot;Eight-Eight fleet&quot; of eight battleships and eight battlecruisers after the United States announced the reinitiation of a major naval construction program in 1919. However, after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, work on the ships was suspended; one pair was cancelled in November 1923 and the other in April 1924.

===Number 13 class===

The &quot;Number 13&quot;–class battleship was a planned class of four fast battleships to be built after the &quot;Kii&quot; class during the 1920s. The ships never received any names, being known only as &quot;Numbers 13–16&quot;. They were intended to reinforce Japan&#x27;s &quot;Eight-Eight Fleet&quot; of eight battleships and eight battlecruisers after the United States announced the reinitiation of a major naval construction program in 1919. The &quot;Number 13&quot; class was designed to be superior to all other existing battleships, planned or building. After the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, they were cancelled in November 1923 before construction could begin.

===&quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruiser===

The &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers were rebuilt as fast battleships during the 1920s and &#x27;30s. Their turbines and boilers were replaced by lighter, more powerful models, they were bulged to improve their underwater protection, their horizontal armor was increased and the range of their guns was increased.

The &quot;Kongō&quot;s were the most active capital ships of the IJN during the Pacific War, participating in most of the major engagements. &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&quot; acted as escorts during the attack on Pearl Harbor, while &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot; supported the Dutch East Indies Campaign. All four participated in the Battles of Midway and Guadalcanal. &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&quot; were both sunk during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, while &quot;Haruna&quot; and &quot;Kongō&quot; jointly bombarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The two remaining sisters spent most of 1943 shuttling between Japanese naval bases before participating in the major naval campaigns of 1944. They helped to sink two American destroyers and an escort carrier during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. &quot;Kongō&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine in November, while &quot;Haruna&quot; was sunk at her moorings by an air attack on Kure Naval Base in late July 1945; she was raised and scrapped in 1946.

===&quot;Yamato&quot; class===

The were built at the beginning of the Pacific War. The ships were the largest and most heavily armed battleships ever constructed. Two ships ( and ) were completed as battleships, while a third () was converted to an aircraft carrier during construction. A fourth ship was scrapped while still under construction and a planned fifth ship was never begun.

Due to the threat of American submarines and aircraft carriers and worsening fuel shortages, both &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; spent the majority of their careers in naval bases at Brunei, Truk, and Kure—deploying on several occasions in response to American raids on Japanese bases—before participating in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, as part of Vice Admiral Kurita&#x27;s Center Force. &quot;Musashi&quot; was sunk during the battle by American airplanes. &quot;Shinano&quot; was sunk ten days after her commissioning in November 1944 by the American submarine while &quot;Yamato&quot; was sunk by US carrier aircraft in April 1945 during Operation Ten-Go.

===Design A-150===
&quot;Design A-150&quot;, popularly known as the &quot;Super Yamato&quot; class, was a planned class of battleships. In keeping with the IJN&#x27;s long-held doctrine of qualitative superiority, they were designed to be the most powerful battleships afloat. As part of this, the class would have been armed with six guns, the largest weapons carried aboard any warship in the world. Design work on the A-150s began after the preceding &quot;Yamato&quot; class was mostly finished by early 1941, when the Japanese began focusing on aircraft carriers and other smaller warships in preparation for the coming conflict. No A-150 would ever be laid down, and many details of the class&#x27;s design were destroyed near the end of the war.

<text>The is a network of tolled expressways in the Greater Tokyo Area of Japan. It is operated and maintained by the .

Most routes are grade separated and have many sharp curves and multi-lane merges that require caution to drive safely. The speed limit is 60 km/h on most routes, 80 km/h on the Bayshore Route, and 50 km/h on the Inner Circular Route.

As of 2014, the cash toll for a standard-size car is ¥1300 regardless of distance traveled. Vehicles using the ETC toll-collection system pay a distance-based toll ranging from ¥300 to ¥1300 for ordinary vehicles (see toll price) – in some cases substantially less than the previous fixed-rate toll. Lower cash rates exist for certain radial routes (where there are only a few kilometers of expressway remaining) and ETC users have various time-of-day discounts. For large vehicles, the toll is doubled.

==History==
The Metropolitan Expressway was first built between Kyobashi Exit in Chūō, Tokyo and Shibaura Exit in Minato, Tokyo in 1962 for the purpose of increasing traffic flow efficiency in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, thus optimizing and improving the functionality of the traffic system. Since then, 280 kilometers of highway network has been built in the Tokyo metropolitan area; 30 kilometers more of highway are either constructed or planned, making the Metropolitan Expressway a vast network of urban expressways in the Tokyo region.

Like other expressways in Japan including the Tōmei Expressway, the Shuto line has become a common street racing road. One of the lines, the Bayshore Route (also known as the Wangan route), received worldwide notoriety during the 1990s as the home course for the Mid Night Club, one of the most notorious street racing clubs, who were known for their 300 km/h, sometimes 320 km/h exploits. These exploits and street racing culture on the Shuto Expressway have made it a well-known location for street racing and speed records.

Due to this infamy, the Wangan is the setting for several entertainment franchises, such as the manga and arcade game &quot;Wangan Midnight&quot;, video games &quot;Shutokou Battle&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;7&quot; (as the street circuit) and the movie series &quot;Shuto Kousoku Trial&quot;. Numerous car enthusiast magazines and DVDs, like &quot;Best Motoring&quot;, also highlight races and activities on the Wangan.

Inner Tokyo sections of the expressway prohibit motorcycle pillion passengers due to poor road geometry. The C2 route allows motorcycles with pillion passengers to travel through. The ban does not apply to motorcycles equipped with a sidecar. The segments with a pillion ban include the important C1 Inner Circular route and adjoining central Tokyo routes. 

There are 21 parking areas scattered throughout the Shuto Expressway system. In general these are much smaller than the service areas available every or so on inter-city expressways.

<doc id="491042" wikidata="Q4391413" url="?curid=491042" title="Ōoku (2003 TV series)">
<text>is a Japanese drama produced by FujiTV. The story is set in the Edo period and is fiction set against a background of historical fact. The &quot;Ōoku&quot; was the part the ladies lived in Edo Castle.

The popularity of the show has produced six series (1968, 1983, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2024) as well as a 2006 film, &quot;Oh! Oku&quot;.

==Summary==
The story is set in Edo period in Ōoku, a place where thousands of women work for one general. The story is told from the point of view of Maru, a girl from a merchant family. At that time, working in Ōoku was popular among girls. Maru was curious about Ōoku and took a job there out of curiosity. Other workers tended to bully her. One day, Tokuko, wife of a Tokugawa shogun(御台所 midaidokoro) saved Maru from the bullying. Maru and Tokuko become very close friends, even though there were from different ranks in society.

Tokuko was born into a high-class samurai family in Satsuma. She had a boyfriend, Tougo, who she wanted to marry, but for political reasons had to marry Iesada Tokugawa and lived her whole life in Ōoku. Tokuko is clever, tough, and self-confident, and always wanted to escape from Ōoku. Maru helps Tokuko adjust to her surroundings. Tokuko didn&#x27;t like the system and rules of Ōoku, so she was defiant toward Takiyama, the woman who administrates the Ōoku.

Takiyama is the woman with the strongest authority in Ōoku, and is able to speak with the shogun equally. She is very strict to everyone, especially Tokuko and Maru, who are considered outsiders. She was born into a very poor family but, because of her beauty, she got a job in Ōoku. She worked hard to protect Ōoku because it is the only place she can live.

Takiyama disliked Tokuko, not only because she was from Satsuma, but because she envied Tokuko being Iesada Tokugawa&#x27;s wife. Takiyama used to be Iesada&#x27;s lover, but they couldn&#x27;t marry or even love each other officially because of the distinction between their ranks. Iesada&#x27;s feeling toward Tokuko grew when he married her, but Takiyama still couldn&#x27;t forget about Iesada and was especially strict toward Tokuko. Takiyama asks one of her workers to poison Tokuko.

One day, Tokuko fell flat suddenly when she was eating. Someone had poisoned her dinner. Tokuko narrowly escaped death and started doubting Takiyama, but Takiyama ignored her doubts. Tokuko found poison in the kitchen, and asked Takiyama what the poison was. Takiyama said that it was a medicine for not having a baby. Tokuko was Iesada&#x27;s wife, but he already had a child who would become the next shogun. Therefore, it was better for Tokuko to not have any children. Tokuko was shocked by Takiyama&#x27;s story.

Tokuko was in the depths of despair. Having children was her only hope in Ōoku. If she could have a baby, she would have a hope for living. Though, as Takiyama said, she was not allowed to have a baby; thus she completely lost her hope for living. At the same time, Iesada&#x27;s body was eaten up by unknown illness.

One day, there was a fire in Edo castle and Ōoku was also damaged. Ōoku was in panic. Maru took Tokuko somewhere safe, but Tokuko suddenly went to the opposite side. Maru ran to Iesada to tell about Tokuko. Iesada went inside Ōoku again to find Tokuko. Takiyama tried to stop him but he won&#x27;t listen. Though, he fell down spitting blood. Tokuko was found by Maru and heard about Iesada. She stayed beside him, but there was nothing Tokuko can do. Iesada died taking Tokuko&#x27;s hand.

Tokuko&#x27;s lover, Tougo, came from Satsuma to help Tokuko escape from Ōoku, but she refused his offer. Tokuko decided to live in Ōoku and do what she can. She told Tougo that she learned lot of things from Iesada. Takiyama hears this conversation and changes her image of Tokuko.

Iesada Tokugawa&#x27;s age had ended. Tokuko later took a tonsure, who would be later named &quot;Tenshoin&quot;.

<text>is a 2002 Japanese television drama series based on the manga &quot;The Drifting Classroom&quot; by Kazuo Umezu.

==Plot==

One day, Yuka Misaki, a daughter of a flower shop owner meets Akio Asami, a college student. They are both attracted to each other, and they actually exchange phone numbers, which are stored in their cellphones. After they part, Asami&#x27;s bag (along with his cellphone) is stolen, and he can&#x27;t recall the phone number, so he effectively has no way to contact Misaki. 

One year later, Yuka begins a job at her father&#x27;s flower shop and Akio becomes a mathematics teacher at Motokura High School. One day in November, Yuka goes to the Motokura High School to collect money for the flowers and meets Akio again. However, they can&#x27;t get along well. In January, Yuka gets a call from Ryuta Fujisawa and they promise to meet that afternoon. In the morning, Yuka goes to the school again to collect money that she couldn&#x27;t collect before. 

Akio finds Yuka in the playground and calls out to her. At that moment, a large earthquake occurs. By the time it stops, their school is surrounded by dry and sandy desert. Not only Yuka and Akio, but other students including Tadashi Otomo, Shou Takamatsu, Fumiya Ikegaki are in the school that day. 

The students begin to panic, but Yuka and Akio try to calm them. At first, the students are pessimistic because there is not enough food and water. However, they begin to accept what happened to them. Many strange things happen in the desert. They see a total eclipse of the sun that they can&#x27;t see in 2002. They see a train which should not exist in 2002. From those two things, they notice that they are in the future. 

They start to think that they have to survive in that world and change the &quot;future.&quot; Otherwise, there will be no &quot;future.&quot; They begin to think about the reasons why they are transferred to the future. That is because they are chosen to change the future. 

At the same time, they write a letter to them in the past. Everyone says that people have to live &quot;now&quot; at the best they can. 

One day, an eruption occurs and the earth gets its natural sources back. In the past, they were spoiling the sources a lot without noticing. However, they learn the importance of the natural resources by now. They decide to save them and will not spoil them again. 

Also, they use water to water flowers to raise the flowers and grasses. Several years later, the earth revive again and the school building is surrounded by grasses instead of deserts. They tried their best to live in the future and the future is changed.

<doc id="491051" wikidata="Q1362305" url="?curid=491051" title="Hossein Derakhshan">
<text>Hossein Derakhshan (; born January 7, 1975), also known as Hoder, is an Iranian-Canadian blogger, journalist, and researcher who was imprisoned in Tehran from November 2008 to November 2014. He is credited with starting the blogging revolution in Iran and is called the father of Persian blogging by many journalists. He also helped to promote podcasting in Iran. Derakhshan was arrested on November 1, 2008 and sentenced to 19½ years in prison on September 28, 2010. His sentence was reduced to 17 years in October 2013. He was pardoned by Iran&#x27;s supreme leader and on November 19, 2014, was released from Evin prison.

==Education==
Derakhshan started his education in Nikan High School in Tehran. He has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran. He spent time studying sociology at the University of Toronto. He holds a master&#x27;s degree (MA) in Film and Media Studies from SOAS, University of London, 2008.

== Early journalism ==
Derakhshan started out as a journalist writing about Internet and digital culture for reformist newspaper, &quot;Asr-e Azadegan&quot; in 1999. Later, when this paper was closed down by the judiciary system, he moved to another newspaper, &quot;Hayat-e No&quot;. His column there was called &quot;Panjere-i roo be hayaat&quot; (A Window to the Life, a reference to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot;), and later expanded to a weekly page on digital culture, Internet and computer games.

== Blogging advocacy ==
In December 2000, Derakhshan moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On September 25, 2001, he started his weblog in the Persian language. It was titled &quot;Sardabir: khodam&quot;, or &quot;Editor: Myself&quot;.

He later moved his manually maintained weblog to Blogger.com, which was not supporting Unicode at the time. He also prepared a step-by-step guide in Persian on how other Persian writers can start their weblogs using Blogger.com and the Unicode standard.
Derakhshan spoke at the Wikimania 2005 conference in Frankfurt, Germany regarding the complementary use of wikis and blogs to aid political reform and the growth of democracy in Iran and other countries.

On leaving Iran, he was briefly detained and summoned to the Ministry of Intelligence. A few days later he was interrogated by an intelligence official over the content of his blog and was forced to sign an apology before being allowed to leave Iran. But after leaving Iran, he published a report on what happened on his website.

==Activism==
===Anti-censorship===
Derakhshan&#x27;s weblog, like some other political Persian blogs and websites, has been blocked (or filtered) by the government in Iran, since 2004.

In December 2003, he founded &quot;Stop censoring us&quot;, a blog to watch the situation of internet censorship in Iran. He appeared a few times on a VOA Persian TV show to talk about Internet censorship and methods to get around filters.

===Against Israel-Iran escalation===
Derakhshan visited Israel as a Canadian citizen in early 2006 and early 2007. Before his first visit, he stated that he went to Israel as a personal attempt to start a dialogue between Iranian and Israeli people.
This might mean that I won&#x27;t be able to go back to Iran for a long time, since Iran doesn&#x27;t recognize Israel, has no diplomatic relations with it, and apparently considers traveling there illegal. Too bad, but I don&#x27;t care. Fortunately, I&#x27;m a citizen of Canada and I have the right to visit any country I want.

I&#x27;m going to Israel as a citizen journalist and a peace activist. As a citizen journalist, I&#x27;m going to show my 20,000 daily Iranian readers what Israel really looks like and how people live there. The Islamic Republic has long portrayed Israel as an evil state, with a consensual political agenda of killing every single man and woman who prays to Allah, including Iranians. I&#x27;m going to challenge that image.

As a peace activist, I&#x27;m going to show the Israelis that the vast majority of Iranians do not identify with Ahmadinejad&#x27;s rhetoric, despite what it looks like from the outside. I&#x27;m going to tell them how any kind of violent action against Iran would only harm the young people who are gradually reforming the system and how the radicals would benefit from such situation.
His second visit was to participate in a conference at The Chaim Herzog Center for Middle East Studies and Diplomacy at Ben-Gurion University in Beer Sheva. The annual international conference in 2007 was titled &#x27;Reform, Resistance, and Conflicts in the Middle East.&quot; Hossein participated in panel titled &#x27;Weblogging as a Space of Resistance&#x27;, where he spoke about Iranian weblogs in a presentation titled as &#x27;Internet in Iran: Are Weblogs and other forms of new media helping democracy in Iran?&#x27;.

His visits were widely covered by the local and international media, including &quot;Haaretz&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, Ynet News, Ha&#x27;ir, Time Out Tel Aviv, Israeli Radio and its Persian service, Israel&#x27;s English TV news, &quot;New York Times&quot;, BBC, etc.:

== Views ==

===Iran&#x27;s nuclear program===
In August 2006, he published an article in the Columns &amp; Blogs section of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which he supported Iran pursuing nuclear weapons as a deterrent to possible invasion by global powers, after normalising relations with the U.S. and Israel: However, later after his prison sentence he supported Iran&#x27;s nuclear deal with the six world powers.

===Defending Iran against U.S. attack===
Derakhshan wrote in his blog in December 2006: &quot;If the US attacked Iran, despite all my problems with the Islamic Republic, I&#x27;d go back and fight these bastards. ... I can&#x27;t let myself sit down for a moment and watch them make a Baghdad out of Tehran.&quot; He later published a commentary on &quot;The Guardian&quot;, titled &quot;Stop Bullying Iran&quot;, in which he elaborated on his short blog post on why he defends Iran.

==Khalaji vs. Derakhshan defamation lawsuit==
In November 2007, Mehdi Khalaji, a fellow at a hawkish think-tank called Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), filed a $2 million libel and defamation lawsuit against Derakhshan, over one of his blog posts in his Persian blog, in which he criticizes Khalaji for his service to the &quot;enemies of his people and humanity&quot;, referring to the American hawkish policy makers on its board who were close to the George W. Bush administration and were closely involved in his interventionist middle east policy, including the occupation of Iraq, such as Richard Perle, Condoleezza Rice and James Woolsey. The case was dropped after Derakhshan&#x27;s imprisonment in Iran.

Earlier in August 2007, Derakhshan&#x27;s Florida-based hosting company, Hosting Matters, had terminated his hosting account as a result of alleged &#x27;intimidation&#x27; by Khalaji.

== Arrest and imprisonment (2008–2014) ==
On November 1, 2008, Derakhshan was arrested at his family home in Tehran. During November, he was allowed four calls to his family, each lasting about one minute.

On November 18, the anti-censorship group Global Voices Online published an article about Derakhshan&#x27;s arrest. A few days later, &quot;the Times&quot; of London published a report saying Derakhshan had been arrested for spying on behalf of Israel. Amnesty International later suggested that he was likely to face accusations of &quot;insulting religion.&quot;

On December 30, Alireza Jamshidi, the speaker of the Judicial system of Iran confirmed Derakhshan&#x27;s arrest, but did not mention any Israel-related accusations. Jamshidi said that Derakhshan was in the custody of the Islamic Revolutionary Court and his case was in early discovery phase, and that among Derakhshan&#x27;s accusations is what he had written about the &quot;Pure Imams&quot;.

Nineteen Iranian bloggers published a letter &quot;categorically condemn[ing] the circumstances surrounding Derakhshan&#x27;s arrest and detention and demand[ing] his immediate release&quot;. A website &quot;Free the blogfather&quot; was created by supporters of Derakhshan in order to campaign for his freedom. Before an earlier return to Iran in 2005, Derakhshan had published recommendations of what to do if he or someone else were arrested in Iran, including requests to &quot;spread the word&quot;, to &quot;get the English-language media involved&quot; and to &quot;get the publicity translated [into Persian]&quot; and &quot;keep it up&quot;.

In April 2009, the New York Times reported that Derakhshan was still detained without charges.

In October 2009, approaching the one-year anniversary of his arrest, his family began speaking out to Persian and English-language media, and Derakhshan&#x27;s father Hassan sent an open letter to the new head of the Iranian Judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani asking for information about his son&#x27;s detention.

On October 29, 2009, according to Derakhshan&#x27;s brother Hamed, Derakhshan&#x27;s parents met with the new district attorney, who allowed them to have dinner in Evin Prison with their son. The brother also said that at the dinner, Hossein confirmed human rights activists&#x27; reports claiming Derakhshan had been subject to physical and psychological pressures such as being forced to do squats in cold showers, receiving repeated beatings, being subject to solitary confinedment, beatings, threats to arrest family members, and false promises of his release, in an effort to secure a confession to espionage charges.

Derakhshan&#x27;s father, Hassan, also wrote a public letter to the head of the judiciary asking for Derakhshan&#x27;s release.

===Trial in 2010 and further developments===
In March 2010, Derakhshan&#x27;s mother, Ozra Kiarashpour, called on the head of Iran&#x27;s judiciary to release her son, who had at that point been detained for 500 days without any official charge, for the Iranian New Year, or Norouz.

In June 2010, Tehran Revolutionary Court held Derakhshan&#x27;s first trial. His sister Azadeh reported that the trial ended in late July, but no word on a verdict was available.

On September 28, Derakhshan was sentenced to 19½ years in prison. According to state-owned Mashregh News, which is close to Iran&#x27;s presidential office, Derakhshan was convicted on charges of cooperation with hostile countries (a reference to the Israel visit), spreading propaganda against the ruling establishment, promotion of counterrevolutionary groups and insulting Islamic thought and religious figures.

On December 9, Derakhshan was released for two days on a bail of $1.5m (£950,000)

On May 6, 2011, Derakhshan updated his Facebook profile and photos, and added a one line status update of &quot;On a very short leave from Evin&quot;.

In June 2011, Derakhshan&#x27;s family said that the Iranian appeals court has upheld his conviction.

In October 2013, Derakhshan&#x27;s sentence was reduced from 19.5 years to 17 years, as a result of the Supreme Leader&#x27;s pardoning for Eid al-Fitr.

===November 2014 release===
Derakhshan was pardoned by the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei in 2014 and freed from prison on November 19, 2014.

== Post-prison activities ==
After his release, Derakhshan wrote an essay for &quot;Matter&quot; on how the internet had changed in his absence, titled &quot;The Web We Have to Save&quot; (2015). It was widely translated and published in various languages. The essay was the basis for a short video documentary he produced for Mozilla Foundation.

He has continued writing and speaking about socio-political implications of social media and the future of journalism. He received a research fellowship at Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Shorenstein Center in Spring 2018. The invitation caused a controversy and a number of prominent Iranian journalists including Roya Hakakian and Maziar Bahari accused Derakhashan of framing Iranian scholars Ramin Jahanbegloo and Hale Sfandiari.

He has co-authored a report on &quot;fake news&quot; and disinformation with Claire Wardle, titled &quot;Information Disorder&quot; (2017) which was commissionned by Council of Europe, in which he notably coined the term &quot;malinformation&quot;. He has also co-authored a few opinion pieces about information disorder with Wardle.

In 2018, Derakhshan restarted writing and commenting on Iran.

In the 2021 Iranian presidential election, Derakhshan advocated participation in the election. The election broke records of the lowest turnout in Iranian electoral history and concluded with the victory of Ebrahim Raisi. Hemmati ended up in the third place (fourth considering invalid ballots).

<text>Lelluri (also spelled Lilluri, Liluri) was a Hurrian goddess worshiped in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria. She was associated with mountains, and in known sources appears in connection with the god Manuzi.

== Character ==
Lelluri most likely originated in the Nur Mountains, and her name ends with the Hurrian suffix -&quot;luri&quot;, known also from the theonyms Upelluri (a primordial giant from the Kumarbi Cycle), and Impaluri (&quot;sukkal&quot; of the sea god), as well as a number of Hurrian mountain and stone names. Assyriologist Beate Pongratz-Leisten regards her as a deity &quot;associated with Hurrian identity.&quot;
Volkert Haas describes Lelluri as &quot;lady of the mountains&quot; (&quot;die Herrin der Gebirge&quot;).

She was closely linked with Manuzi, a god associated with both the weather and mountains. She was likely his partner, and that they shared a temple in Kummani.

A lexical text from Emar indicates that she was understood as analogous to the Mesopotamian goddess Ninmena.

== Worship ==
According to Volkert Haas, Lelluri was worshiped chiefly in the proximity of Nur Mountains and Orontes River in the west and as far east as the middle of the Euphrates. In Kizzuwatna she was celebrated during the &quot;hišuwa&quot; festival, whose purpose was to guarantee the wellbeing of the king and his family. Among the other deities present in texts pertaining to it are &quot;Teshub Manuzi&quot; (weather god of [Mt.] Manuzi) Ishara, Allani, Maliya and two hyposthases of Nupatik. During the festival, the formula &quot;Lelluri has achieved her heart&#x27;s desire&quot; had to be recited aloud after pouring an offering for her into a rhyton. A so-called &quot;ambašši&quot; offering to her consisted out of a lamb, a goose, a sheep and a loaf of bread.

Like the so-called &quot;Syrian substrate&quot; deities (Ishara, Kubaba, Aštabi, Adamma), Hebat and Šarruma Lelluri was also incorporated into Hittite religion. King Ḫattušili I mentions her (alongside Allatum, the storm god of Aleppo, and the mountain gods Adalur and Amaruk) among the deities whose statues he brought to Hatti as war booty. However, the exact location of the city of Haššuwa from which she was brought remains unknown.

<text>The Province of North Carolina, originally known as Albemarle Province, was a proprietary colony and later royal colony of Great Britain that existed in North America from 1712 to 1776.(p. 80) It was one of the five Southern colonies and one of the thirteen American colonies. The monarch of Great Britain was represented by the Governor of North Carolina, until the colonies declared independence on July 4, 1776.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Carolina&quot; is taken from the Latin word for &quot;Charles&quot; (Carolus), honoring King Charles I, and was first named in the 1663 Royal Charter granting to Edward, Earl of Clarendon; George, Duke of Albemarle; William, Lord Craven; John, Lord Berkeley; Anthony, Lord Ashley; Sir George Carteret, Sir William Berkeley, and Sir John Colleton the right to settle lands in the present-day U.S. states of North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.

== History ==
King Charles II granted the Charter of Carolina in 1663 for land south of the British Colony of Virginia and north of Spanish Florida. He granted the land to eight lords proprietor, namely Edward, Earl of Clarendon; George, Duke of Albemarle; William, Lord Craven; John, Lord Berkeley; Anthony, Lord Ashley; Sir George Carteret; Sir William Berkeley; and Sir John Colleton. Charles granted the land in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660. The granted lands included all or part of the present-day U.S. states of North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.

The northern half of the Province of Carolina differed significantly from the southern half, and transportation and communication were difficult between the two regions, so a separate deputy governor was appointed to administer the northern region in 1691.

The partition of Carolina into the Province of North Carolina and the Province of South Carolina was completed at a meeting of the lords proprietor held at Craven House in London on December 7, 1710, although the same proprietors continued to control both colonies. The first provincial governor of North Carolina was Edward Hyde. Unrest against the proprietors in South Carolina in 1719 led King George I to directly appoint a governor in that province, whereas the lords proprietor continued to appoint the governor of North Carolina. Both Carolinas became royal colonies in 1729, after the British government had tried for nearly 10 years to locate and buy out seven of the eight lords proprietor. The remaining one-eighth share of the province was retained by members of the Carteret family until 1776, part of the Province of North Carolina known as the Granville District.

In 1755 Benjamin Franklin, the Postmaster-General for the American colonies, appointed James Davis as the first postmaster of North Carolina colony at New Bern. In October of that year the North Carolina Assembly awarded Davis the contract to carry the mail between Wilmington, North Carolina and Suffolk, Virginia.

By the late eighteenth century, the tide of immigration to North Carolina from Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania began to swell. The Scots-Irish (Ulster Protestants) from present-day Northern Ireland were the largest immigrant group from the British Isles to the colonies before the American Revolution. Indentured servants, who arrived mostly in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, comprised the majority of English settlers prior to the Revolution. On the eve of the Revolution, North Carolina was the fastest-growing British colony in North America.
Differences in the settlement patterns of eastern and western North Carolina, or the low country and uplands, affected the political, economic, and social life of the state from the eighteenth until the twentieth century. The small family farms of the Piedmont contrasted sharply with the plantation economy of the coastal region, where wealthy planters grew tobacco and rice with slave labor. The Tidewater in eastern North Carolina was settled chiefly by immigrants from rural England and the Scottish Highlands. The upcountry of western North Carolina was settled chiefly by Scots-Irish, English and German Protestants, and the so-called &quot;cohee&quot;poor, non-Anglican, independent farmers. During the Revolution, the English and Highland Scots of eastern North Carolina tended to remain loyal to the King because of longstanding business and personal connections with Great Britain. The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence.

With no cities and very few towns or villages, the province was rural and thinly populated. Local taverns provided multiple services ranging from strong drink and beds for travelers to meeting rooms for politicians and businessmen. In a world sharply divided along lines of ethnicity, gender, race, and class, the tavern keepers&#x27; rum proved a solvent that mixed together all sorts of locals and travelers. The increasing variety of drinks on offer and the emergence of private clubs meeting in the taverns showed that genteel culture was spreading from London to the periphery of the English world. The courthouse was usually the most imposing building in a county. Jails were often an important part of the courthouse but were sometimes built separately. Some county governments built tobacco warehouses to provide a common service for their most important export crop.
Expansion westward began early in the eighteenth century from the provincial seats of power on the coast, particularly after the conclusion of the Tuscarora and Yamasee wars, in which the largest barrier was removed to provincial settlement farther inland. Settlement in large numbers became more feasible over the Appalachian Mountains after the French and Indian War and the accompanying Anglo-Cherokee War, in which the Cherokee and Catawba were effectively neutralized. King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763 in order to stifle potential conflict with Indians in that region, including the Overhill Cherokee. This barred any settlement near the headwaters of any rivers or streams that flowed westward towards the Mississippi River. It included several North Carolina rivers, such as the French Broad and Watauga. This proclamation was not strictly obeyed and was widely detested in North Carolina, but it somewhat delayed migration westward until after the Revolution.

Settlers continued to flow westwards in smaller numbers, despite the prohibition, and several trans-Appalachian settlements were formed. Most prominent was the Watauga Association, formed in 1772 as an independent territory within the bounds of North Carolina which adopted its own written constitution. Notable frontiersmen such as Daniel Boone traveled back and forth across the invisible proclamation line as market hunters, seeking valuable pelts to sell in eastern settlements, and many served as leaders and guides for groups who settled in the Tennessee River valley and the Kentucke County.

== Geography ==

The oldest counties were Albemarle County (16641689) and Bath County (16961739). During the period of 1668 to 1774, 32 counties were created. As western counties, such as Anson and Rowan Counties were created, their western borders were not well defined and extended west as far as the Mississippi. Toward the end of this period, the boundaries were more well defined and extended to include the Cherokee lands in the west.

Two important maps of the province were produced: one by Edward Moseley in 1733, and another by John Collet in 1770. Moseley was surveyor general of North Carolina in 1710 and from 1723 to 1733. He was also the first provincial treasurer of North Carolina, starting in 1715. Moseley was responsible, with William Byrd, for surveying the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia in 1728. Other maps exist dating to the early period of the Age of Discovery that depict the coastline of the province along with that of South Carolina.

The ports for which there were Customs Agents in the Province of North Carolina included: Bath, Roanoke, Currituck Precinct, Brunswick (Cape Fear), and Beaufort (Topsail Inlet).

There were 52 new towns established in the Province of North Carolina between 1729 and 1775. Major towns during this period included: Bath (chartered in 1705), Brunswick (founded after 1726, destroyed during the Revolution), Campbellton (established in 1762), Edenton (chartered in 1712), Halifax (chartered in 1757), Hillsborough (1754), Newbern (settled in 1710, chartered in 1723), Salisbury (chartered in 1753), and Wilmington (founded in 1732, chartered in 1739 or 1740). Each of these nine major towns had a single representative in the North Carolina House of Burgesses in 1775. Campbellton and the town of Cross Creek (established in 1765) were combined in 1783 to form the town of Fayetteville.

== Government ==
There were two primary branches of government, the governor and his council and the assembly, called the House of Burgesses. All provincial officials were appointed by either the lords proprietor prior to 1728 or The King afterwards. The King received advice for appointment of the governor from the Secretary of State for the Southern Department. The governor was accountable to the Secretary of State and the Board of Trade. The governor was also responsible for commissioning officers and provisioning the provincial militia. Besides the governor, other provincial officials included a secretary, attorney general, surveyor general, the receiver general, Chief Justice, five Customs Collectors for each of the five ports in North Carolina, and a council. The Council advised the governor and also served as the upper house of the legislature. Members of the lower house of the legislature, the House of Burgesses, were elected from precincts (counties after 1736) and from districts (also called boroughs or towns, which were large centers of population).
The eight provincial governors appointed by the King were:
# Edward Hyde (1712)
# Charles Eden (17141722)
# George Burrington (17241725), (17311734)
# Sir Richard Everard (17251731)
# Gabriel Johnston (17341752)
# Arthur Dobbs (17541764)
# William Tryon (17641771)
# Josiah Martin (17711776)

The last provincial council included the following members:

* Samuel Cornell
* William Dry
* George Mercer (Lieutenant Governor)
* James Hasell (Chief Baron of the Exchequer, Acting Governor in 1771)
* Martin Howard (Chief Justice)
* Alexander McCulloch
* Robert Palmer
* John Rutherfurd (Receiver General)
* Lewis Henry De Rosset
* John Sampson
* Samuel Strudwick (Clerk)
* Thomas McGuire (Attorney General)
Governor Martin issued a proclamation on April 8, 1775, dissolving the General Assembly after they presented a resolve endorsing the Continental Congress that was to be held in Philadelphia. The provincial council met for the last time onboard HMS &quot;Cruizer&quot; in the Cape Fear River on July 18, 1775, they believed that the &quot;deluded people of this Province&quot; would see their error and return to their allegiance to the King.

The Court Act of 1746 established a supreme court, initially known as the General Court, which sat twice a year at Newbern, consisting of a Chief Justice and three Associate Justices. The 14 chief justices of the Supreme Court appointed by the King included the following:

<text>Asr-e Azadegan () was a Persian-language daily newspaper in Iran published briefly between 1999 and 2000.

==History and profile==
&quot;Asr-e Azadegan&quot; was established on 7 October 1999. The founder and publisher of the daily was Hamid Reza Jalaipour who also launched &quot;Jameah&quot;, &quot;Toos&quot; and &quot;Neshat&quot;; all of which had been closed down before the launching of &quot;Asr-e Azadegan&quot;. However, the existence of &quot;Asr-e Azadegan&quot; lasted very brief and it was banned in April 2000 for publishing articles which &quot;disparaged Islam and the religious elements of the Islamic revolution.&quot;

The paper was edited by Mashallah Shamsolvaezin. The manager editor was Ghafour Garshasbi who was acquitted of publishing articles that violated the Iranian press law in October 2000.

The newspaper&#x27;s editors included:
* Akbar Ganji, who wrote about Iranian secret services.

<doc id="491064" wikidata="Q1044394" url="?curid=491064" title="Province of Carolina">
<text>The Province of Carolina was a province of the Kingdom of England (1663–1707) and later the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1712) that existed in North America and the Caribbean from 1663 until the Carolinas were partitioned into North and South in 1712.

The North American Carolina province consisted of all or parts of present-day Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

==Etymology==
&quot;Carolina&quot; is taken from the Latin word for &quot;Charles&quot; (Carolus), honoring King CharlesI.

==First patents and settlements==
On October 30, 1629, King Charles I of England granted a patent to Sir Robert Heath for the lands south of 36 degrees and north of 31 degrees, &quot;under the name, in honor of that king, of Carolana.&quot;
Heath wanted the land for French Huguenots, but when Charles restricted use of the land to members of the Church of England, Heath assigned his grant to George, Lord Berkeley.
King Charles I was executed in 1649 and Heath fled to France where he died. Following the 1660 restoration of the monarchy, Robert Heath&#x27;s heirs attempted to reassert their claim to the land, but Charles II ruled the claim invalid.

Although the Lost Colony on Roanoke Island was the first English attempt at settlement in the Carolina territory, the first permanent English settlement was not established until the 1653 Albemarle Settlement, when emigrants from the Virginia Colony, with others from New England and Bermuda, settled at the mouths of the Chowan and Roanoke Rivers, on the shores of Albemarle Sound, in the northeastern corner of present-day North Carolina.

Within three generations of Columbus, the Spanish from their Florida base had started to emigrate up the coast of modern North Carolina. A Virginia tribe defending their resources and families drove them back to Georgia. A Scottish contingent had meanwhile settled in South Carolina only to be extirpated by the Spanish, who inhabited Parris Island as late as 1655. The Spanish were again beaten back to Georgia.

==1663 Charter==
===Lords Proprietors===
On March 24, 1663, Charles II issued a new charter to a group of eight English noblemen, granting them the land of Carolina as a reward for their faithful support of his efforts to regain the throne of England. The eight were called &quot; Lords Proprietors&quot; or simply &quot;Proprietors&quot;.

The 1663 charter granted the Lords Proprietor title to all of the land from the southern border of the Virginia Colony at 36 degrees north to 31 degrees north; this included all the land between these northerly and southerly bounds from the Atlantic westward to the shores of the Pacific Ocean.
The King intended for the newly created province to serve as an English bulwark to contest lands claimed by Spanish Florida and prevent their northward expansion.

The Lords Proprietors named in the charter were:
* Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon
* George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle
* William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven
* John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton
* Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury
* Sir George Carteret
* Sir William Berkeley (brother of John)
* Sir John Colleton, 1st Baronet 

Of the eight, the one who demonstrated the most active interest in Carolina was Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury. Shaftesbury, with the assistance of his secretary, the philosopher John Locke, drafted the Grand Model for the Province of Carolina (which included the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina), a plan for government of the colony heavily influenced by the ideas of the English political scientist, James Harrington. Some of the other Lords Proprietors also had interests in other colonies: for instance, John Berkeley and George Carteret held stakes in the Province of New Jersey, and William Berkeley had an interest in Virginia.

The Lords Proprietors, operating under their royal charter, were able to exercise their authority with nearly the independence of the king himself. The actual government consisted of a governor, a powerful council, on which half of the councilors were appointed by the Lords Proprietors themselves, and a relatively weak, popularly elected assembly.

In 1665, the charter was revised slightly (see Royal Colonial Boundary of 1665), with the northerly boundary extended to 36 degrees 30 minutes north to include the lands of settlers along the Albemarle Sound who had left the Virginia Colony. Likewise, the southern boundary was moved south to 29 degrees north, just south of present-day Daytona Beach, Florida, which had the effect of including the existing Spanish settlement at St. Augustine.

===Settlements===
In 1663, Captain William Hilton noted the presence of a wooden cross erected by the Spaniards that still stood before the town meeting house of the Indians living at what later became Port Royal. In 1665, Sir John Yeamans established a second short-lived English settlement on the Cape Fear River, near present-day Wilmington, North Carolina, which he named Clarendon. From 1675 to 1677, the Province fought the Chowanoc Natives in the Chowanoc War.

In 1669, William Sayle of Bermuda had taken over the command of the party of settlers gathered in Bermuda after Sir John Yeamans resigned while undergoing repairs of his vessel in Bermuda. Most of the party was made up of emigrants from England who had arrived in Bermuda en route to the establishment of the settlement in the Carolinas. Sayle arrived in Carolina aboard a Bermuda sloop with a number of Bermudian families to found the town of Charlestown.

In early 1670 the Lords Proprietors founded a sturdier new settlement named Charles Town (present day Charleston) when they sent 150 colonists to the province, landing them on the south bank of the Ashley River, South Carolina. (The town moved across the river to a more defensible site on the peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper Rivers in 1680.

In 1670, William Sayle, then in his eighties, became the first Colonial Governor of the colony of Carolina.
 Many of the other colonists were planters from Barbados.

The &quot;Charles Town&quot; settlement, as it was known then, developed more rapidly than the Albemarle and Cape Fear settlements due to the advantages of a natural harbor and expanding trade with the West Indies. Charles Town was made the principal seat of government for the entire province; Lord Shaftesbury specified its street plan. The nearby Ashley and Cooper rivers are named for him.

Due to their remoteness from each other, the northern and southern sections of the colony operated more or less independently until 1691, when Philip Ludwell was appointed governor of the entire province. From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. The north continued to have its own assembly and council; the governor resided in Charles Towne and appointed a deputy-governor for the north. During this period, the two-halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina.

==Government==
In 1669, the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina divided the colony of Carolina into two provinces, Albemarle province in the north and Clarendon province in the south. Due to dissent over the governance of the colony, and the distance between settlements in the northern half and settlements in the southern half, a deputy governor was appointed to administer the northern half of Carolina (Albemarle province) in 1691. In 1712, the two provinces became separate colonies, the colony of North Carolina (formerly Albemarle province) and the colony of South Carolina (formerly Clarendon province).

Carolina was the first of three colonies in North America settled by the English to have a comprehensive plan. Known as the Grand Model, or Grand Modell, it was composed of a constitution and detailed guidelines for settlement and development. The constitution, titled Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, was drafted by the philosopher John Locke under the direction of Anthony Ashley Cooper (later made Earl of Shaftesbury).

From 1708 to 1710, due to disquiet over attempts to establish the Anglican church in the province, the people were unable to agree on a slate of elected officials; consequently, there was no recognized and legal government for more than two years, a period which culminated in Cary&#x27;s Rebellion when the Lords Proprietors finally commissioned a new governor. This circumstance, coupled with the Tuscarora War and the Yamasee War, and the inability of the Lords Proprietors to act decisively, led to separate governments for North and South Carolina.

==Later years==
Some identify the 1708–1710 period as the establishment of separate colonies, but that did not officially occur until 1729 when seven of the Lords Proprietors sold their interests in Carolina to the Crown, and both North Carolina and South Carolina became royal colonies. The eighth share was Sir George Carteret&#x27;s, which had passed to his great-grandson John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville. He retained ownership of a sixty-mile-wide strip of land in North Carolina adjoining the Virginia boundary, which became known as the Granville District. This district was to become the scene of many disputes, from 1729 until the American Revolutionary War, at which time it was seized by the North Carolina revolutionary government. Governments under proprietary rule and under crown rule were similarly organized. The primary difference was who was to appoint the governing officials: the Lords Proprietors or the Sovereign.

Although the division between the northern and southern governments became complete in 1712, both colonies remained in the hands of the same group of proprietors. A rebellion against the proprietors broke out in Charlestown, South Carolina (as it was now spelled) in 1719, which led to the appointment of a royal governor for South Carolina in that same year. North Carolina would become a royal colony in 1729.

<doc id="491066" wikidata="Q7134438" url="?curid=491066" title="Paradox (theorem prover)">
<text>Paradox is a finite-domain model finder for pure first-order logic (FOL) with equality developed by Koen Lindström Claessen and Niklas Sörensson at the Chalmers University of Technology. It can a participate as part of an automated theorem proving system. The software is primarily written in the Haskell programming language. It is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and is free.

==Features==
The Paradox developers described the software as a &quot;Mace-style&quot; method after the McCune&#x27;s tool of that name. The Paradox introduced new techniques which help to reduce the computational complexity of the model search problem:
* &quot;term definitions&quot;, new variable reduction technique,
* &quot;incremental satisfiability checker&quot; which works with small domains first, then gradually increases the size of the domain, reusing the information it obtained from previous failed searches,
* &quot;static symmetry reduction&quot; which adds extra constraints,
* &quot;sort inference&quot; which works with unsorted problems.

Paradox was developed up to version 4, the final version being effective in model finding for Web Ontology Language OWL2.

==Competition==
Paradox was a division winner in the annual CADE ATP System Competition, an annual contest for automated theorem proving, in the years 2003 to 2012.

<doc id="491067" wikidata="Q418432" url="?curid=491067" title="Anaphase-promoting complex">
<text>Anaphase-promoting complex (also called the cyclosome or APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that marks target cell cycle proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. The APC/C is a large complex of 11–13 subunit proteins, including a cullin (Apc2) and RING (Apc11) subunit much like SCF. Other parts of the APC/C have unknown functions but are highly conserved.

It was the discovery of the APC/C (and SCF) and their key role in eukaryotic cell-cycle regulation that established the importance of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in cell biology. Once perceived as a system exclusively involved in removing damaged protein from the cell, ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation by the proteasome is now perceived as a universal regulatory mechanism for signal transduction whose importance approaches that of protein phosphorylation.

In 2014, the APC/C was mapped in 3D at a resolution of less than a nanometre, which also uncovered its secondary structure. This finding could improve understanding of cancer and reveal new binding sites for future cancer drugs.

== Function ==
The APC/C&#x27;s main function is to trigger the transition from metaphase to anaphase by tagging specific proteins for degradation. The three major targets for degradation by the APC/C are securin and S and M cyclins. Securin releases separase, a protease, when degraded. Separase then triggers the cleavage of cohesin, the protein complex that binds sister chromatids together. During metaphase, sister chromatids are linked by intact cohesin complexes. When securin undergoes ubiquitination by the APC/C and releases separase, which degrades cohesin, sister chromatids become free to move to opposite poles for anaphase. The APC/C also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, resulting in the inactivation of M-CDK (mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase) complexes, promoting exit from mitosis and cytokinesis.

Unlike the SCF, activator subunits control the APC/C. Cdc20 and Cdh1 are the two activators of particular importance to the cell cycle. These proteins target the APC/C to specific sets of substrates at different times in the cell cycle, thus driving it forward. The APC/C also plays an integral role in the maintenance of chromatin metabolism, particularly in G1 and G0, and plays a key role in phosphorylation of H3 through destruction of the aurora A kinase.

The critical substrates of the APC/C appear to be securin and the B type cyclins. This is conserved between mammals and yeast. In fact, yeast are viable in the absence of the APC/C if the requirement for targeting these two substrates is eliminated.

== Subunits ==
There is not a vast amount of extensive investigation on APC/C subunits, which serve mostly as adaptors. Studies of APC subunits are mainly conducted in yeast, and studies show that the majority of yeast APC subunits are also present in vertebrates, this suggests conservation across eukaryotes. Eleven core APC subunits have been found in vertebrates versus thirteen in yeast. Activator subunits bind to APC at varying stages of the cell cycle to control its ubiquitination activity, often by directing APC to target substrates destined for ubiquitination. The specificity of APC ligases is proposed to be controlled by the incorporation of specificity factors into the ligase complex, instead of substrate phosphorylation. i.e.: The subunit, CDC20 allows APC to degrade substrates such as anaphase inhibitors (Pdsp1) at the beginning of anaphase, on the other hand when CDC20 is substituted for specificity factor Hct1, APC degrades a different set of substrates, particularly mitosis cyclins in late anaphase. Activators CDC20 and Cdh1 are of particular significance and are the most widely studied and familiar of the APC/C subunits.

The catalytic core of the APC/C consists of the cullin subunit Apc2 and RING H2 domain subunit Apc11. These two subunits catalyze ubiquitination of substrates when the C-terminal domain of Apc2 forms a tight complex with Apc11. RING/APc11 binds to the E2-ubiquitin conjugate that catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to an active site in E2.
In addition to the catalytic functionality, other core proteins of the APC are composed multiple repeat motifs with the main purpose of providing molecular scaffold support. These include Apc1, the largest subunit which contains 11 tandem repeats of 35–40 amino acid sequences, and Apc2, which contains three cullin repeats of approximately 130 amino acids total. The major motifs in APC subunits include tetratricopeptide (TPR) motifs and WD40 repeats 1. C-termini regions of CDC20 and Cdh1 have a WD40 domain that is suggested to form a binding platform that binds APC substrates, thus contributing to APCs ability to target these substrates, although the exact mechanism through which they increase APC activity is unknown. It is also suggested that variations in these WD40 domains result in varying substrate specificity, which is confirmed by recent results suggesting that different APC substrates can directly and specifically bind to Cdc20 and Cdh1/Hct1 Ultimately, the specificity differences are responsible for the timing of the destruction of several APC targets during mitosis. With CDC20 targeting a few major substrates at metaphase and Cdh1 targeting a broader range of substrates towards late mitosis and G1.

Most notably, 4 subunits of yeast APC/C consist almost entirely of multiple repeats of the 34 amino acid tetratricopeptide residue (TPR) motif. These TPR subunits, Cdc16, Cdc27, Cdc23, and Apc5, mainly provide scaffolding and support to mediate other protein-protein interactions. Cdc27 and Cdc23 have been shown to support the binding of Cdc20 and Cdh1, as mutations in key residues of these subunits led to increased dissociation of the activators. Apc10/Doc1, has been shown to promote substrate binding by mediating their interactions with Cdh1 and Cdc20.

In particular, CDC20 (also known as p55CDC, Fizzy, or Slp1) inactivates CDK1 via ubiquitination of B-type cyclins. This results in activation of Cdh1(a.k.a. Fizzy-related, Hct1, Ste9, or Srw1), which interacts with APC during late mitosis and G1/G0. Cdh1 is inactivated via phosphorylation during S, G2 and early M phase. During these points in the cycle, it is not able to be assembled.

Evidence shows that APC3 and APC7 serve to recruit Cdh1 to the anaphase-promoting complex. This further supports that Cdh1 is responsible for maintaining APC activity during G1. Cdh1 does not require APC to be phosphorylated in order to bind, in fact, phosphorylation of Cdh1 by Cdks prevents it from binding to APC from S to M phase. With destruction of M-Cdk, release of CDC20 from the APC and binding of Cdh1 can now occur, allowing APC activity to continue on during G1 entry. While Cdh1 recognizes M and S cyclins, allowing for their destruction until the entire cell commits to proceed to a new cycle, it does not recognize G1/S cyclins, and during G1/S phase, their cyclin activity can rise unhindered and phosphorylate and thus inactivating Cdh1 and therefore APC.

The subunit Apc15 plays an important role in APC/CCdc20 activation following the bi-orientation of sister chromatids across the metaphase plate. When kinetochores are unattached to spindles, mitotic checkpoint complexes (MCC) and inhibit APC. In the absence of Apc15, MCCs and Cdc20 remain locked on the APC/C preventing its activity once the spindle checkpoint requirements are met. Apc15 mediates the turnover of Cdc20 and MCCs to provide information on the attachment state of kinetochores.

===CDC27/APC3===

One of the subunits that exhibit the TPR motif, CDC27 has been identified to interact with mitotic checkpoint proteins such as Mad2, p55CDC and BUBR1, suggesting that it may have involvement in the timing of M phase. Evidence shows that CDC27 is involved in a ternary complex with SMAD2/3 and Cdh1, which is created in response to TGFβ signalling. Because of its interaction with Cdh1 in particular, it has a potential role in determining affinity between APC and its activators Cdc20 and Cdh1. A study suggests that TGF-β-induced Cdc27 phosphorylation enhances interaction between cdc27 and Cdh1–which is directly involved in activating APC. CDC27 can serve as a vehicle through which TGFβ signalling can activate APC. Induced CDC27 hyperphosphorylation by TGFβ showed elevated APC activity.

===CDC23, CDC16, CDC27===

CDC23, another TPR subunit interacts with SWM1, binding to the D-box of CLB2. Based upon hybrid assays in vivo and co-immunoprecipitation in vitro, it is suggested that Cdc16p, Cdc23p and Cdc27p (analogs in Sacchyromyces cerevisiae) interact and form a macromolecular complex. Their common theme of TPR is suggested to mediate these interactions. As for Cdc27 and Cdc16 in drosophila, their functions have been tested via RNA interference (RNAi). Results suggest that they may mediate activity of the entire complex via different mechanisms at different sites. In further drosophila studies, Cdk16 and cdk23 appear to be activated via phosphorylation by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and its fission yeast counterpart, appear to bind particularly to Cdc23.

The complex is understood to be regulated by activators CDC20 and Cdh1 during mitosis. Their role in degradation for cyclin B is demonstrated by a screen of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants defective for cyclin B degradation, which were found to have mutations in CDC16 and CDC23 genes. Mutants for CDC27, CDC23 and CDC 27 all resulted in a cell-cycle arrest at metaphase.

== Substrate recognition ==
APC/C substrates have recognition amino acid sequences that enable the APC/C to identify them. The most common sequence is known as the destruction box or D-box. APC/C brings together an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and the D-box rather than being an intermediate covalent carrier. The D-box should have a version of the following amino acid sequence: RXXLXXXXN, where R is arginine, X is any amino acid, L is Leucine, and N is asparagine. The Ken-box is another motif of importance. Its sequence should resemble the one that follows: KENXXXN, where K is lysine and E is glutamate. The last amino acid position in the Ken-box is highly variable. Though it has been shown that mutations in the sequences do inhibit destruction of the proteins &quot;in vivo&quot;, there is still much to learn about how proteins are targeted by the APC/C.

Once bound to APC/C, Cdc20 and Cdh1 serve as D and KEN box receptors for various APC substrates. Kraft &quot;et al.&quot; have shown that the substrates&#x27; D boxes bind directly to the highly conserved WD40 repeat propeller region on the APC activators. It is important to note that the conserved area of the propeller of Cdh1 is much larger than that of Cdc20, allowing Cdh1 to have a broader substrate specificity, consistent with the fact that APC/CCdh1 also activates APC-mediated destruction of KEN box containing substrates. The D box further enhances protein degradation, for Lysine residues in close proximity to the D box serve as targets of ubiquitylation. It has been found that a Lys residue immediately C-terminal to the D box can function as a ubiquitin acceptor.

Many APC substrates contain both D and KEN boxes, with their ubiquitylation by either APC/CCdc20 or APC/CCdh1 dependent on both sequences, yet some substrates contain only either a D box or a KEN box, in one or multiple copies. Having two distinct degradation sequences creates a high level of substrate specificity on the APC/C, with APC/CCdc20 being more dependent on the D box and APC/CCdh1 more dependent on the KEN box. For example, APC/CCdh1 is capable of ubiquitylating KEN box-only-containing substrates like Tome-1 and Sororin.

Although Cdc20 and Cdh1 may serve as D and KEN box receptors, the low affinity of these co-activator–substrate interactions suggests that it is unlikely that the co-activators alone are sufficient to confer high-affinity substrate binding to the APC/CCdc20 and APC/CCdh1. Consequently, core APC/C subunits, like Apc10, contribute towards substrate association as well. In APC/C constructs lacking the Apc10/Doc1 subunit, substrates like Clb2 are unable to associate with APCΔdoc1–Cdh1, while addition of purified Doc1 to the APCΔdoc1–Cdh1 construct restores the substrate binding ability.

== Metaphase to anaphase transition ==

As metaphase begins, the spindle checkpoint inhibits the APC/C until all sister-kinetochores are attached to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, a process known as chromosome biorientation. When all kinetochores are properly attached, the spindle checkpoint is silenced and the APC/C can become active. M-Cdks phosphorylate subunits on the APC/C that promote binding to Cdc20. Securin and M cyclins (cyclin A and cyclin B) are then targeted by APC/CCdc20 for degradation. Once degraded, separin is released, cohesin is degraded and sister chromatids are prepared to move to their respective poles for anaphase.

It is likely that, in animal cells, at least some of the activation of APC/CCdc20 occurs early in the cell cycle (prophase or prometaphase) based on the timing of the degradation of its substrates. Cyclin A is degraded early in mitosis, supporting the theory, but cyclin B and securin are not degraded until metaphase. The molecular basis of the delay is unknown, but is believed to involve the key to the correct timing of anaphase initiation. In animal cells the spindle checkpoint system contributes to the delay if it needs to correct the bi-orientation of chromosomes. Though how the spindle checkpoint system inhibits cyclin B and securin destruction while allowing cyclin A to be degraded is unknown. The delay may also be explained by unknown interactions with regulators, localization and phosphorylation changes.

This initiates a negative feedback loop. While activation of APC/CCdc20 requires M-Cdk, the complex is also responsible for breaking the cyclin to deactivate M-CdK. This means that APC/CCdc20 fosters its own deactivation. It is possible that this negative feedback is the backbone of Cdk activity controlled by M and S cyclin concentration oscillations.

== M to G1 transition ==

Upon completion of mitosis, it is important that cells (except for embryonic ones) go through a growth period, known as G1 phase, to grow and produce factors necessary for the next cell cycle. Entry into another round of mitosis is prevented by inhibiting Cdk activity. While different processes are responsible for this inhibition, an important one is activation of the APC/C by Cdh1. This continued activation prevents the accumulation of cyclin that would trigger another round of mitosis and instead drives exit from mitosis.

In the beginning of the cell cycle Cdh1 is phosphorylated by M-Cdk, preventing it from attaching to APC/C. APC/C is then free to attach to Cdc20 and usher the transition from metaphase to anaphase. As M-Cdk gets degraded later in mitosis, Cdc20 gets released and Cdh1 can bind to APC/C, keeping it activated through the M/G1 transition. A key difference to note is that while binding of Cdc20 to APC/C is dependent on phosphorylation of APC/C by mitotic Cdks, binding of Cdh1 is not. Thus, as APCCdc20 becomes inactivated during metaphase due to dephosphorylation resulting from inactive mitotic Cdks, Cdh1 is able to immediately bind to APC/C, taking Cdc20&#x27;s place. Cdc20 is also a target of APC/CCdh1, ensuring that APC/CCdc20 is shut down. APC/CCdh1 then continues working in G1 to tag S and M cyclins for destruction. However, G1/S cyclins are not substrates of APC/CCdh1 and therefore accumulate throughout this phase and phosphorylate Cdh1. By late G1, enough of the G1/S cyclins have accumulated and phosphorylated Cdh1 to inactivate the APC/C until the next metaphase.

Once in G1, APCCdh1 is responsible for the degradation of various proteins that promote proper cell cycle progression. Geminin is a protein that binds to Cdt1 which prevents its binding to the origin recognition complex (ORC). APCCdh1 targets geminin for ubiquitination throughout G1, keeping its levels low. This allows Cdt1 to carry out its function during pre-RC assembly. When APCCdh1 becomes inactive due to phosphorylation of Cdh1 by G1/S cyclins, geminin activity is increased again. Additionally, Dbf4 stimulates Cell division cycle 7-related protein kinase (Cdc7) activity, which promotes activation of replication origins. APCCdh1 is thought to target Dbf4 for destruction. This could provide an answer as to how Cdc7 is activated at the beginning of a new cell cycle. Its activity likely corresponds to the inactivation of APC/CCdh1 by G/S cyclins.

==Additional regulation==

APC/CCdc20 inactivation during early stages of the cell cycle is partially achieved by the protein Emi1. Initial experiments have shown that addition of Emi1 to Xenopus cycling extracts can prevent the destruction of endogenous cyclin A, cyclin B, and mitotic exit, suggesting that Emi1 is able to counteract the activity of the APC. Furthermore, depletion of Emi1 in somatic cells leads to the lack of accumulation of cyclin B. The lack of Emi1 likely leads to a lack of inhibition of the APC preventing cyclin B from accumulating.

From these early observations, it has been confirmed that in G2 and early mitosis, Emi1 binds and inhibits Cdc20 by preventing its association with APC substrates. Cdc20 can still be phosphorylated and bind to APC/C, but bound Emi1 blocks Cdc20&#x27;s interaction with APC targets. Emi1 association with Cdc20 allows for the stabilization of various cyclins throughout S and G2 phase, but Emi1&#x27;s removal is essential for progression through mitosis. Thus, in late prophase, Emi1 is phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase, Plk. Plk is activated during early mitosis by Cdk1 activity, and its phosphorylation of Emi1&#x27;s BTRC (gene) βTrCP binding site makes it a target for SCF, leading to its subsequent destruction in prometaphase. Emi1&#x27;s destruction leads APC/CCdc20 activation, allowing for the destruction of cyclin A in early mitosis. Emi1 levels begin to rise again in G, which help inhibit APC/CCdh1.

Regulation of APC/CCdc20 activity towards metaphase substrates like securin and cyclin B may be a result of intracellular localization. It is hypothesized that spindle checkpoint proteins that inhibit APC/CCdc20 only associate with a subset of the Cdc20 population localized near the mitotic spindle. In this manner, cyclin A can be degraded while cyclin B and securin are degraded only once sister chromatids have achieved bi-orientation.

<doc id="491073" wikidata="Q1172412" url="?curid=491073" title="Field (computer science)">
<text>In data hierarchy, a field (data field) is a variable in a record. A record, also known as a data structure, allows logically related data to be identified by a single name. Identifying related data as a single group is central to the construction of understandable computer programs. The individual fields in a record may be accessed by name, just like any variable in a computer program.

Each field in a record has two components. One component is the field&#x27;s datatype declaration. The other component is the field&#x27;s identifier.

== Memory fields ==
Fields may be stored in random access memory (RAM). The following Pascal record definition has three field identifiers: firstName, lastName, and age. The two name fields have a datatype of an array of character. The age field has a datatype of integer.

type PersonRecord =
 record
 lastName : array [ 1 .. 20 ] of Char;
 firstName : array [ 1 .. 20 ] of Char;
 age : Integer
 end;
In Pascal, the identifier component precedes a colon, and the datatype component follows the colon. Once a record is defined, variables of the record can be allocated. Once the memory of the record is allocated, a field can be accessed like a variable by using the dot notation.

var alice : PersonRecord;
alice.firstName := &#x27;Alice&#x27;;
The term &quot;field&quot; has been replaced with the terms &quot;data member&quot; and &quot;attribute&quot;. The following Java class has three attributes: firstName, lastName, and age.

public class PersonRecord
 private String firstName;
 private String lastName;
 private int age;


== File fields ==

Fields may be stored in a random access file. A file may be written to or read from in an arbitrary order. To accomplish the arbitrary access, the operating system provides a method to quickly &quot;seek&quot; around the file. Once the disk head is positioned at the beginning of a record, each file field can be read into its corresponding memory field.

File fields are the main storage structure in the Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM). In relational database theory, the term &quot;field&quot; has been replaced with the terms &quot;column&quot; and &quot;attribute&quot;.

<text>Albert Edward Pryke Briggs (1 March 1923 – 4 October 2008) was a British seaman and the last of the three survivors of the destruction of the battlecruiser . He remained in the Royal Navy after the Second World War and was later commissioned, serving a total of 35 years in the Royal Navy by the time of his retirement in 1973.

==Early life==
Born 1 March 1923 in Redcar, North Riding of Yorkshire, Briggs first saw &quot;Hood&quot; at anchor off the River Tees when he was 12, and volunteered to join the Royal Navy the following day. He was told he would have to wait until he was 15, so it was on 7 March 1938, one week after his 15th birthday, that he finally joined the navy. 

==Naval service==
Briggs was trained at for 16 months. After his training he was delighted to be assigned to HMS &quot;Hood&quot; which he joined on 29 July 1939. He initially served as an officers&#x27; messenger.

===Sinking of &quot;Hood&quot;===
Soon after the Second World War began, &quot;Hood&quot; was assigned to patrol and escort duty in the North Atlantic and also served as part of Force H in the Mediterranean Sea. In May 1941, &quot;Hood&quot; was dispatched with to intercept the in the Denmark Straits. The German ship was 20 years newer and slightly larger than &quot;Hood&quot;. She had modern main armament and superior armour. The battle-cruiser encountered &quot;Bismarck&quot; and engaged her at long range. &quot;Bismarck&quot; returned fire and destroyed &quot;Hood&quot;, killing all aboard except for Briggs and two others. The Battle of the Denmark Strait and the loss of &quot;Hood&quot; were regarded by the British public as one of the greatest disasters to befall the Royal Navy during the war. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; survived, only to be sunk by Japanese bombers in December 1941.

Briggs, on the compass platform near the bridge, recalled not hearing the initial explosion, but only a huge sheet of flame that shot around &quot;Hood&quot;″s compass platform, followed by a heavy list. When the list reached 30 degrees Briggs realised that &quot;she was not coming back&quot;. Briggs states that no order was given to abandon ship, saying that &quot;It just wasn&#x27;t necessary,&quot; and that he found himself in the water about from &quot;Hood&quot; as her B-Turret went under after he made it only halfway down the ladder leading to the bridge. As Briggs and the remaining crew on the compass platform struggled to escape, Briggs remembered &quot;The flag Lieutenant who was just in front of me stood to one side to let me go through ... I&#x27;ll never forget that.&quot; He also could remember how the compass master had stood on the platform &quot;tall and fearless&quot; as the water pulled him down. Briggs himself attempted to swim away from the vessel but was pulled under by her as she started toward the ocean bottom. Briggs remembers struggling to stay afloat, giving up hope, and then miraculously being propelled to the surface. This was probably the result of air escaping from the ship, possibly the bridge windows collapsing and releasing trapped air, or a boiler explosion. He then remembered that &quot;When I reached the surface, away I saw her bows, vertical out of the water. That image would haunt me in nightmares for the next 40 years. When I swam clear of the ship, seconds later I turned back, she was gone&quot;.

After &quot;Hood&quot; sank, Briggs got aboard a raft from the ship and saw only two other survivors, Bob Tilburn and Bill Dundas, who boarded some rafts as well. Briggs paddled his raft to the other two survivors and stayed by their sides, holding their hands and singing popular British songs to keep them conscious. After three hours, and about to pass out from hypothermia, the three survivors were rescued by .

The three were the only survivors of the sinking; 1,415 were confirmed lost. In both publications and recorded interviews, he refers to the sacrifice made by the squadron&#x27;s navigating officer Commander John Warrand, who stood aside and allowed him to exit the compass platform first. Briggs also confirms that the squadron commanding officer, Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland, was last seen still sitting in his admiral&#x27;s chair, in utter dejection. He was making no attempt to escape the ship as she sank.

===Later career===
After the loss of &quot;Hood&quot; he was assigned to and also participated in the inquiry into the loss of &quot;Hood&quot;. He was then transferred to and then to the requisitioned merchantman . &quot;Hilary&quot; served as a Combined Operations Headquarters ship, at Salerno and had the same role during the D-Day landings. Later he served aboard HMS &quot;Mercury&quot; as a fleetwork instructor. Briggs was promoted first to leading signalman in March 1942, and then yeoman of signals in March 1943. Briggs remained in the Royal Navy after the end of the war, became an officer, and served until 1973 in a variety of capacities.

==Retirement==
Briggs retired on 2 February 1973, with the rank of lieutenant, settled in the south of England and worked in Fareham as a furnished lettings manager. In the year he retired, at the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. In 1975, Briggs joined the HMS &quot;Hood&quot; Association as one of its youngest members and was elected as its first President. In 1995, Briggs again served as president of the organisation.

Briggs regularly told his story as a guest-speaker, lecturer, and subject of historical television and radio documentaries. In July 2001, Briggs visited the wreck site and released a plaque which commemorates the lost crew of the &quot;Hood&quot;. He was co-author of a book on the subject, titled &quot;Flagship &quot;Hood&quot;: The Fate of Britain&#x27;s Mightiest Warship&quot;. Briggs recorded an oral history with the Imperial War Museum, which is available on its website.

==Death==

Briggs died in the Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, on 4 October 2008 at the age of 85.

<text>Roosevelt is a neighborhood in northern Seattle, Washington. Its main thoroughfare, originally 10th Avenue, was renamed Roosevelt Way upon Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1919. The neighborhood received the name as the result of a Community Club contest held eight years later, in 1927.

Roosevelt&#x27;s principal and minor arterials are the one-way pair Roosevelt Way (southbound) and 12th Avenue NE (northbound), Lake City Way (SR 522) and 15th Avenue NE, and NE 65th and 75th Streets. City streets are laid out and designated in a pattern; see street layout of Seattle, directionals.

The boundaries of the neighborhood are Interstate 5 to the west, beyond which lies Green Lake; NE Ravenna Boulevard and NE 60th Street to the south, beyond which is the University District; 15th Avenue NE to the east, beyond which is Ravenna; and Lake City Way (SR 522) to the north, beyond which lies Maple Leaf.

==Schools==
The Roosevelt district is also home to Roosevelt High School (RHS, opened 1922), one of the older schools in the Seattle Public Schools District. Like the street, it is named after Teddy, not Franklin D. Roosevelt. For many years, Roosevelt High School and Garfield High School juggled the lead in the school district in many academic and sports fields. Alumni include Mark Pattison, who played football for the University of Washington Huskies and was drafted in the seventh round in 1985 by the Oakland Raiders of the NFL, actress Rose McGowan,(also attended Nova) and Nobel laureates Linda B. Buck and Robert Lucas Jr.

==Shops==
Although primarily a residential neighborhood, the Roosevelt district had a Sears department store from 1928 to 1980. After its closure, the land was redeveloped as Roosevelt Square, which now features supermarket Whole Foods Market and a Mud Bay pet store among other businesses. A block beyond Roosevelt Way to the west is the longest-established vegetarian restaurant in Seattle, independent Sunlight Cafe, nearly as old (1978) as Starbucks. Numerous other small businesses still line 65th Street and Roosevelt Way. Teddy&#x27;s is a multi-generational, multi-subculture popular biker bar. Roosevelt Way from 62nd Street north to 64th was somewhat of an &quot;audio row&quot;, having featured a concentration of stores selling high-end audio and video systems and components. Today, only two such stores remain.

== Parks ==

The neighborhood includes two parks: Cowen Park, in the southeast corner (contiguous with the larger Ravenna Park of Ravenna); and Froula Playground, in the northeast corner, adjacent to the Green Lake Reservoir. The source of Ravenna Creek has been reduced to Cowen Park; since completion of the partial daylighting in 2006, the creek has been reconnected to Lake Washington.

==Transportation==

The underground Roosevelt Link light rail station located at NE 65th St and 12th Ave NE opened for service on October 2, 2021, which connects Roosevelt to downtown Seattle as well as the Northgate neighborhood to the north.

The Roosevelt Light-Rail Station sparked remarkable growth in the area. During the nine-year transit construction period, the neighborhood transformed by replacing single-family homes with midrise apartments. Between 2016 and the opening of rail in 2021, there was a 95% increase in housing units, totaling 1,626 new residences.

<doc id="491090" wikidata="Q2061493" url="?curid=491090" title="Raphe nuclei">
<text>The raphe nuclei (, &quot;seam&quot;) are a moderate-size cluster of nuclei found in the brain stem. They have 5-HT1 receptors which are coupled with Gi/Go-protein-inhibiting adenyl cyclase. They function as autoreceptors in the brain and decrease the release of serotonin. The anxiolytic drug Buspirone acts as partial agonist against these receptors. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are believed to act in these nuclei, as well as at their targets.

==Anatomy ==
The raphe nuclei are traditionally considered to be the medial portion of the reticular formation, and
appear as a ridge of cells in the center and most medial portion of the brain stem.

In order from caudal to rostral, the raphe nuclei are known as the &quot;nucleus raphe obscurus&quot;, the &quot;nucleus raphe pallidus&quot;, the &quot;nucleus raphe magnus&quot;, the &quot;nucleus raphe pontis&quot;, the &quot;median raphe nucleus&quot;, &quot;dorsal raphe nucleus&quot;, &quot;caudal linear nucleus&quot;. In the first systematic examination of the raphe nuclei, Taber &quot;et al.&quot;. (1960) originally proposed the existence of two linear nuclei (nucleus linearis intermedius and nucleus linearis rostralis). This study was published before techniques enabling the visualization of serotonin or the enzymes participating in its synthesis had been developed, as first demonstrated by Dahlström and Fuxe in 1964. Later, it was revealed that of these two nuclei, only the former (nucleus linearis intermedius, now known as the caudal linear nucleus), proved to contain serotonin-producing neurons, though both of them contain dopaminergic neurons.

In some works (e.g.), researchers have grouped the nuclei lineares into one nucleus, the nucleus linearis, shrinking the number of raphe to seven, e.g.,
NeuroNames makes the following ordering:
* Raphe nuclei of medulla oblongata
** Nucleus raphe obscurus
** Nucleus raphe magnus
** Nucleus raphe pallidus
* Raphe nuclei of the pontine reticular formation
** Nucleus raphe pontis
** Nucleus centralis inferior
* Raphe nuclei of the midbrain reticular formation
** Nucleus centralis superior (&quot;median raphe nucleus&quot;)
** Nucleus raphe dorsalis

==Nomenclature==
The Latin names commonly used for most of these nuclei are grammatically and orthographically incorrect. Latin grammar would require to use the genitive case &quot;raphes&quot; (&#x27;of the seam&#x27;) instead of the nominative case &quot;raphe&quot; (&#x27;seam&#x27;) in these Latin expressions. The main authority in anatomical names, Terminologia Anatomica uses for example &quot;nucleus raphes magnus&quot; instead of the grammatically incorrect &quot;nucleus raphe magnus&quot;. The spelling &quot;raphe/raphes&quot; however can also be contested as numerous sources indicate that &quot;raphe&quot; is an incorrect Latin rendering of the Ancient Greek word ῥαφή as the initial letter rho with rough breathing (&quot;spiritus asper&quot;) is normally rendered as &quot;rh&quot; in Latin. The edition of the Nomina Anatomica that was ratified in Jena in 1935 used &quot;rhaphe&quot; instead of &quot;raphe&quot;.

==Projections==
These nuclei interact with almost every pertinent portion of the brain, but only a few of them have specifically independent interaction. These select nuclei are discussed as follows.

Overall, the caudal raphe nuclei, including the nucleus raphe magnus, nucleus raphe pallidus and nucleus raphe obscurus, all project towards the spinal cord and brain stem. The more-rostral nuclei, including the nucleus raphe pontis, nucleus centralis superior (also called median raphe nucleus, mRN) and nucleus raphe dorsalis (dRN) project towards the brain areas of higher function 

The numerous projections from the mRN and dRN to key brain structures make serotonergic system fundamental in regulating brain homeostasis. However, studies also show feedback loops from numerous areas of the brain controlling the serotonergic neurons located in the nucleus raphe dorsalis, including the orbital cortex, cingulate cortex, medial preoptic area, lateral preoptic area, and several areas of the hypothalamus. The connection between these areas, particularly between the nucleus raphe dorsalis and the orbital cortices, is thought to have influences on depression and obsessive compulsive disorder prognosis.
== Function ==
The raphe nuclei have a vast impact upon the central nervous system.
Many of the neurons in the nuclei (but not the majority) are serotonergic; i.e., contain serotonin, a type of monoamine neurotransmitter and are modulated through fibrous pathways in the midbrain.

Projections from the raphe nuclei also terminate in the dorsal horn of spinal gray matter where they regulate the release of enkephalins, which inhibit pain sensation.

The raphe nuclei provide feedback to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), thus contributing in circadian rhythms in animals. The SCN transmits to the raphe nuclei via the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus altering serotonin levels for sleep/wake states. The raphe nuclei will then transmit feedback to the SCN about the animal&#x27;s vigilance and levels of alertness. This reciprocal feedback between the two structures provides an adaptable yet stable basis of circadian rhythms.

=== Thermoregulation ===

A large increase in sympathetic nerve activity was observed when an excitatory amino acid was injected into the Raphe Pallidus, resulting in both brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperature and heart rate increasing. This suggests that activation of the raphe nucleus results in an increase in sympathetic activity to the BAT.

The raphe pallidus wasn&#x27;t switched off using 8-OH-DPAT, which in turn reduced body temperature due to a reduced response to cold. This suggests the importance of the raphe nucleus in responding appropriately to the cold.

===The raphe nuclei and the effects of ghrelin===
More recent studies of the Raphe Nuclei done with rats involve the effects of ghrelin on the dorsal raphe nucleus. When administered, larger doses of ghrelin act centrally on the raphe nucleus, hippocampus, and amygdala which causes dramatic increases in food intake, memory retention, and increases in anxiety. The effects of ghrelin are seen on the raphe nucleus as soon as an hour after injection, suggesting rapid changes in the structure of the nucleus. Changes also occur after 24 hours suggesting delayed modifications as well.

<doc id="491092" wikidata="Q8025676" url="?curid=491092" title="Winnifred Eaton (writer)">
<text>Winnifred Eaton (August 21, 1875 – April 8, 1954) was a Canadian author and screenwriter of Chinese-British ancestry. Publishing prolifically under a number of names, most predominantly, the pseudonym Onoto Watanna, she was one of the first North American writers of Asian descent to publish fiction in English. 

== Biography ==
Eaton was the daughter of an English merchant, Edward C. Eaton (1839 – 1915), and a Chinese performer, Achuen &quot;Grace&quot; Amoy (1846 – 1922). The two married in Shanghai in 1863 but relocated to England a year later. Over the next few years, the Eaton family moved back and forth from England to New York several times before finally relocating permanently to Montreal in 1872, where Winnifred was born.

The Eaton family was large; Winnifred was the eighth of 12 children who survived infancy. Edward Eaton struggled to support the family, who moved frequently from one lodging to the next. Nonetheless, the children were raised in an intellectually stimulating environment. Winnifred&#x27;s eldest sister, Edith Maude Eaton, would become a journalist and, under the pen name Sui Sin Far, an author of stories about Chinese immigrants to the United States, and her older sister Grace Helen Eaton would marry fin-de-siècle editor Walter Blackburn Harte.

Winnifred achieved early success, publishing her first stories in Canadian and U.S. newspapers and magazines as a teenager and publishing her first novel, Miss Nume of Japan, in 1898. She would eventually publish over a dozen novels and dozens of short stories and articles. 

While living in New York City, Eaton met journalist Bertrand Babcock, the son of Emma Whitcomb Babcock and Charles Almanzo Babcock. The two married in 1901 and had four children, three sons and a daughter; Perry, the oldest, died as a child. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1917, and in the same year, Eaton married Francis Fournier Reeve. Moving to Alberta in her native Canada, Eaton ranched with her husband while continuing to write. For a time in the mid-1920s, she moved to work in the film industry, first to New York in 1924 and then, in 1925, to Hollywood. 

She returned to Calgary in 1932 and became an active member of the artistic community, founding Alberta&#x27;s Little Theatre Movement and serving as the president of the Calgary branch of the Canadian Authors&#x27; Association.

In 1954, while returning home from a vacation in California, Eaton fell ill and died of heart failure in Butte, Montana. Following her death, her husband donated funds to build the Reeve Theatre at the University of Calgary. 

== Literary career ==

Eaton claimed to be only 14 when one of her stories was accepted for publication by a Montreal newspaper that had already published pieces by her sister. In fact, she was almost 20 when her story &quot;A Poor Devil&quot; was published in &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot;. Eaton left home at age 20 to take a job as a stenographer for a newspaper in Kingston, Jamaica. She remained there for less than a year, then moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and then Chicago, Illinois, where for a time she worked as a typist while continuing to write short stories. Eventually, her compositions were accepted by the prestigious &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; as well as by other popular periodicals. She published her first novel, Miss Nume of Japan capitalizing on her mixed ancestry to pass herself off as a Japanese American by the name of Onoto Watanna (which sounds Japanese but is not Japanese at all). 

In 1900, Eaton moved to New York City, where her second major novel, &quot;A Japanese Nightingale&quot;, was published. It proved extremely successful, being translated into several languages and eventually adapted both as a Broadway play and then, in 1918, as a motion picture. Her novel &quot;Tama&quot; (1910) was a runaway bestseller and her novel &quot;Me, A Book of Remembrance&quot;, a thinly disguised memoir, told a titillating tale of a woman&#x27;s infidelities. Under her Japanese pseudonym, Eaton published many romance novels and short stories and journalistic works that were widely read throughout the United States. Over the course of her 40-year career, Eaton also had articles published in many popular magazines in the United States, including the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; and Harper&#x27;s Monthly.
In collaboration with her sister Sara Eaton Bosse, Eaton published the &quot;Chinese-Japanese Cook Book&quot; in 1914. The authors preface their history of Asian food and a representative selection of recipes with the reassurance that &quot;When it is known how simple and clean are the ingredients used to make up these oriental dishes, the Westerner will cease to feel that natural repugnance which assails one when about to taste a strange dish of a new and strange land.&quot;

After marrying Frank Reeve and moving to Alberta, Eaton continued to write fiction and journalism, mostly with an Albertan focus. She became intrigued by the financial opportunities offered in the burgeoning film industry and began to write scenarios, or early screenplays, for silent films. After receiving her first credit from Universal Studios in 1921 for the scenario for the silent film &quot;False Kisses&quot;, she left Calgary in 1924 to work at Universal&#x27;s New York City offices. The following year, Universal tapped her to lead their scenario department in Hollywood, California. She also ghost-wrote scripts for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She is credited on six films, all produced by Universal; her work on many others remains uncredited.

Eaton&#x27;s publications, including all her novels, have been collected in the Winnifred Eaton Archive.

<doc id="491093" wikidata="Q945877" url="?curid=491093" title="Harry Vardon">
<text>Henry William Vardon (9 May 1870 – 20 March 1937) was a professional golfer from Jersey. He was a member of the Great Triumvirate with John Henry Taylor and James Braid. Vardon won The Open Championship (aka The British Open) six times, and also won the 1900 U.S. Open.

==Early years==
Born in Grouville, Jersey, Channel Islands, Vardon, whose mother was French and father English, did not play much golf as a youngster, but showed natural talent for the sport as a young caddie in his teens. Harry and his brother Tom Vardon, younger by two years and also interested in golf, were very close. Their golf development was held back by poor family circumstances and their father was not supportive of his sons&#x27; golf interest. Tom moved from Jersey to England first, to pursue a golf career. Harry went to England in the spring of 1890, taking a job as greenkeeper at age 20, at Studley Royal Golf Club, Ripon, Yorks. A year later he became club professional at Bury Golf Club, and in 1896 the club professional at Ganton Golf Club, in Yorkshire. By his early 20s, Harry developed a demanding practice program, the most ambitious seen to that time. He was the first professional golfer to play in knickerbockers – discarding the &quot;proper&quot; dress of an Englishman in an uncomfortable shirt and tie with a buttoned jacket.

In 1896, Vardon won the first of his six Open Championships (a record that still stands today). Vardon had rivalries with James Braid and J.H. Taylor, who each won five Open Championships; together the three formed the &#x27;Great Triumvirate&#x27;, and dominated worldwide golf from the mid-1890s to the mid-1910s. These rivalries increased the public&#x27;s interest in golf.

==Scottish challenge==
In 1898 Harry Vardon won his second Open Championship at Prestwick Golf Club, beating Willie Park, Jnr by a single stroke. Park missed a makeable putt on the 18th green to take the match to a play off. So aggrieved was Park that he immediately offered a challenge to Vardon to play him over 72 holes, 36 holes at his home course of Musselburgh and 36 holes at a golf course of Vardon&#x27;s choosing, for a wager of £100 per side. Park had offered similar challenges before; some years earlier he had met and defeated Ben Sayers at Musselburgh and North Berwick, and in 1897 Park defeated J.H. Taylor over two venues, also for £100 per side. Vardon refused Park&#x27;s challenge; besides the £100 per side, Vardon had nothing to gain from such a match, and he most certainly was not going to play Park at Musselburgh, where fan partisanship was less than courteous to rival players.

Eventually Park conceded to play his home leg at North Berwick Golf Club instead of Musselburgh, and Vardon chose his home course of Ganton, Yorkshire. &quot;Golf Week&quot; magazine acted as both promoter and stakeholder, and the match took place in July 1899, by which time Vardon had won his third Open Championship. The British press billed the encounter as the greatest golf competition of all time. Such was the interest that 10,000 Scottish fans attended the match at North Berwick, and that on a day when the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) was making a State visit to nearby Edinburgh. Special trains were laid on to ferry fans from Edinburgh and other nearby towns. The format of the competition was match play. The first 36 holes at North Berwick ended with Vardon holding a two-hole lead. The second leg took place two weeks later at Ganton, and Vardon completed the rout, winning 11 up with ten holes to play, collecting the £200 prize and the glory.

==Tours United States and Canada==
During his career, Harry Vardon made three visits to North America, in 1900, 1913 and 1920. During all three trips he competed in the U.S. Open finishing 1st, 2nd and tied 2nd.

He became golf&#x27;s first international celebrity in 1900 when he toured the United States and Canada. John Henry Taylor, the 1900 Open Champion and member of the Great Triumvirate, also traveled to the USA on a mini tour in 1900. Vardon played in more than 90 matches and capped it off with a victory in the U.S. Open, where Taylor was second. Vardon wrote that while on this tour, he lost only two matches while playing head-to-head against a single opponent, and both were against the Boston professional Bernard (Ben) Nicholls, older brother of Gilbert Nicholls; the Nicholls brothers had recently emigrated from the British Isles. In 1913, accompanied by Ted Ray, Vardon played in 45 exhibition matches winning 36 of them, and in 1920 at age 50, again accompanied by Ray, he played from July to the beginning of November in nearly 100 exhibition/challenge matches against the likes of Walter Hagen, Jim Barnes, Francis Ouimet and Bobby Jones.

==Twice runner-up in U.S. Opens==
Vardon was the runner-up, after a playoff loss to the 20-year-old Ouimet, at his next U.S. Open in 1913, an event portrayed in the film &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;. He toured North America with Ted Ray that year, as he did once more in 1920. At the age of 50, Vardon was again tied runner-up in his third and final U.S. Open appearance, in 1920; he was leading with a few holes to play.

==Career accomplishments==
During his career, Vardon won 48 tournaments and 21 team events; that was the most titles won by a single player to that juncture in golf history. He won the German Open in 1911 and the British PGA Matchplay Championship in 1912. Between 1898 and 1899 Vardon played in 17 tournaments, winning 14 and coming 2nd in the other three. Vardon popularised the overlapping grip that bears his name, one still used by over 90 percent of golfers; this grip had been originated by Johnny Laidlay a few years before Vardon adopted it. In his later years, he became a golf course architect, designing several courses in Britain, Llandrindod Wells Golf Club, Woodhall Spa and Radcliffe-on-Trent being notable examples.

==Tuberculosis==
Following a bout with tuberculosis in 1903, Vardon struggled with health problems for years, but turned to coaching and writing golf instruction and inspirational books.

==Death and legacy==
After his comeback to the game following a prolonged absence while recovering from tuberculosis, he experienced serious problems with his short-range putting as a result of nerve damage to his right hand, and several commentators claim that he could have added to his list of majors had this disability not afflicted him. Vardon and James Braid collaborated on several editions of Spalding Athletic Library &quot;How to Play Golf&quot;.

Vardon died in 1937 at the age 66, of pleurisy or possibly lung cancer, at his home at 14 (now number 35) Totteridge Lane, Whetstone, London, and is buried in St. Andrew&#x27;s Church cemetery in Totteridge after a funeral service on 24 March. That year, the PGA of America created the Vardon Trophy, now awarded annually to the player on the PGA Tour with the year&#x27;s lowest adjusted scoring average. The British PGA also created the Harry Vardon Trophy which now serves as the award for the winner of the European Tour&#x27;s Race to Dubai. In 1974, Vardon was chosen as one of the initial group of inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame. His most prestigious medals, including those from his six British Open Championships, are on display in a tribute to him at the Jersey Museum. In the annals of golf, he is considered one of the greats of the game. In 2000, Vardon was ranked as the 13th best golfer of all time by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine. Vardon is often called &quot;The Stylist&quot;, &quot;Mr. Golf&quot; and &quot;The Icon of Golfing&quot;; another nickname attached to him was &quot;Greyhound&quot;.
==Vardon grip==

Vardon was also well known for the Vardon grip, or overlapping grip, the grip most popular among professional golfers. In the Vardon grip, one places the little finger of the trailing hand (the one placed lower on the club – right hand for a right-handed player) in between the index and middle finger on the leading hand (the hand that is higher on the club). The leading-hand thumb should fit in the lifeline of the trailing hand. Vardon actually took up this grip some time after Johnny Laidlay, a champion Scottish amateur player, invented it.

==Media depictions==
*A biography of Vardon, published in 1991 and authored by his daughter-in-law, Audrey Howell, provides much intimate detail about the life of this champion.
*English actor Stephen Dillane portrayed Vardon in director Bill Paxton&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;. A book of the same name (upon which the movie was based), written by Mark Frost, goes into great detail depicting Vardon&#x27;s life.
*Irish-American actor Aidan Quinn portrayed Vardon in the 2004 film &quot;Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius&quot;.
*Harry Vardon authored a golf instruction book, &quot;The Gist of Golf&quot;.
*A career record of Vardon, published in 2015 and authored by Bill Williams, provides a definitive list of the tournaments he played in and where he finished in the field.
*Bill Williams authored in 2016 a second book about Vardon, and his three trips to North America in 1900, 1913 and 1920. The book traces the beginnings of golf in America, the influence Vardon had in popularizing the game and his role in bringing about the Ryder Cup.

<text>In abstract algebra, the Weyl algebras are abstracted from the ring of differential operators with polynomial coefficients. They are named after Hermann Weyl, who introduced them to study the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. 

In the simplest case, these are differential operators. Let formula_1 be a field, and let formula_2 be the ring of polynomials in one variable with coefficients in formula_1. Then the corresponding Weyl algebra consists of differential operators of form

: formula_4

This is the first Weyl algebra formula_5. The &quot;n&quot;-th Weyl algebra formula_6 are constructed similarly. 

Alternatively, formula_5 can be constructed as the quotient of the free algebra on two generators, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, by the ideal generated by formula_8. Similarly, formula_6 is obtained by quotienting the free algebra on &quot;2n&quot; generators by the ideal generated byformula_10where formula_11 is the Kronecker delta.

More generally, let formula_12 be a partial differential ring with commuting derivatives formula_13. The Weyl algebra associated to formula_14 is the noncommutative ring formula_15 satisfying the relations formula_16 for all formula_17. The previous case is the special case where formula_18 and formula_19 where formula_20 is a field.

This article discusses only the case of formula_6 with underlying field formula_1 characteristic zero, unless otherwise stated.

The Weyl algebra is an example of a simple ring that is not a matrix ring over a division ring. It is also a noncommutative example of a domain, and an example of an Ore extension.

== Motivation ==

The Weyl algebra arises naturally in the context of quantum mechanics and the process of canonical quantization. Consider a classical phase space with canonical coordinates formula_23. These coordinates satisfy the Poisson bracket relations:formula_24In canonical quantization, one seeks to construct a Hilbert space of states and represent the classical observables (functions on phase space) as self-adjoint operators on this space. The canonical commutation relations are imposed:formula_25where formula_26 denotes the commutator. Here, formula_27 and formula_28 are the operators corresponding to formula_29 and formula_30 respectively. Erwin Schrödinger proposed in 1926 the following:

* formula_31 with multiplication by formula_32.
* formula_33 with formula_34.

With this identification, the canonical commutation relation holds.

== Constructions ==
The Weyl algebras have different constructions, with different levels of abstraction.

=== Representation ===
The Weyl algebra formula_6 can be concretely constructed as a representation.

In the differential operator representation, similar to Schrödinger&#x27;s canonical quantization, let formula_36 be represented by multiplication on the left by formula_32, and let formula_38 be represented by differentiation on the left by formula_39.

In the matrix representation, similar to the matrix mechanics, formula_40 is represented byformula_41

=== Generator ===
formula_42 can be constructed as a quotient of a free algebra in terms of generators and relations.
One construction starts with an abstract vector space &quot;V&quot; (of dimension 2&quot;n&quot;) equipped with a symplectic form &quot;ω&quot;. Define the Weyl algebra &quot;W&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) to be
: formula_43
where &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is the tensor algebra on &quot;V&quot;, and the notation formula_44 means &quot;the ideal generated by&quot;.

In other words, &quot;W&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is the algebra generated by &quot;V&quot; subject only to the relation . Then, &quot;W&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is isomorphic to &quot;An&quot; via the choice of a Darboux basis for .

formula_42 is also a quotient of the universal enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg algebra, the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group, by setting the central element of the Heisenberg algebra (namely [&quot;q&quot;, &quot;p&quot;]) equal to the unit of the universal enveloping algebra (called 1 above).

=== Quantization ===
The algebra &quot;W&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is a quantization of the symmetric algebra Sym(&quot;V&quot;). If &quot;V&quot; is over a field of characteristic zero, then &quot;W&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is naturally isomorphic to the underlying vector space of the symmetric algebra Sym(&quot;V&quot;) equipped with a deformed product – called the Groenewold–Moyal product (considering the symmetric algebra to be polynomial functions on &quot;V&quot;∗, where the variables span the vector space &quot;V&quot;, and replacing &quot;iħ&quot; in the Moyal product formula with 1).

The isomorphism is given by the symmetrization map from Sym(&quot;V&quot;) to &quot;W&quot;(&quot;V&quot;)
: formula_46

If one prefers to have the &quot;iħ&quot; and work over the complex numbers, one could have instead defined the Weyl algebra above as generated by &quot;q&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;iħ∂qi&quot; (as per quantum mechanics usage).

Thus, the Weyl algebra is a quantization of the symmetric algebra, which is essentially the same as the Moyal quantization (if for the latter one restricts to polynomial functions), but the former is in terms of generators and relations (considered to be differential operators) and the latter is in terms of a deformed multiplication.

Stated in another way, let the Moyal star product be denoted formula_47, then the Weyl algebra is isomorphic to formula_48.

In the case of exterior algebras, the analogous quantization to the Weyl one is the Clifford algebra, which is also referred to as the &quot;orthogonal Clifford algebra&quot;.

The Weyl algebra is also referred to as the symplectic Clifford algebra. Weyl algebras represent for symplectic bilinear forms the same structure that Clifford algebras represent for non-degenerate symmetric bilinear forms.

=== D-module ===
The Weyl algebra can be constructed as a D-module. Specifically, the Weyl algebra corresponding to the polynomial ring formula_49 with its usual partial differential structure is precisely equal to Grothendieck&#x27;s ring of differential operations formula_50.

More generally, let formula_51 be a smooth scheme over a ring formula_52. Locally, formula_53 factors as an étale cover over some formula_54 equipped with the standard projection. Because &quot;étale&quot; means &quot;(flat and) possessing null cotangent sheaf&quot;, this means that every D-module over such a scheme can be thought of locally as a module over the formula_55 Weyl algebra.

Let formula_52 be a commutative algebra over a subring formula_57. The ring of differential operators formula_58 (notated formula_59 when formula_57 is clear from context) is inductively defined as a graded subalgebra of formula_61:

* formula_62
* formula_63

Let formula_59 be the union of all formula_65 for formula_66. This is a subalgebra of formula_61.

In the case formula_68, the ring of differential operators of order formula_69 presents similarly as in the special case formula_70 but for the added consideration of &quot;divided power operators&quot;; these are operators corresponding to those in the complex case which stabilize formula_71, but which cannot be written as integral combinations of higher-order operators, i.e. do not inhabit formula_72. One such example is the operator formula_73.

Explicitly, a presentation is given by

:formula_74
with the relations
:formula_75
:formula_76
:formula_77
where formula_78 by convention. The Weyl algebra then consists of the limit of these algebras as formula_79.

When formula_57 is a field of characteristic 0, then formula_81 is generated, as an formula_52-module, by 1 and the formula_57-derivations of formula_52. Moreover, formula_59 is generated as a ring by the formula_52-subalgebra formula_81. In particular, if formula_70 and formula_89, then formula_90. As mentioned, formula_91.

== Properties of &quot;An&quot; ==
Many properties of formula_40 apply to formula_93 with essentially similar proofs, since the different dimensions commute.

=== General Leibniz rule ===


In particular, formula_94 and formula_95.

=== Degree ===


This allows formula_40 to be a graded algebra, where the degree of formula_97 is formula_98 among its nonzero monomials. The degree is similarly defined for formula_93.


That is, it has no two-sided nontrivial ideals and has no zero divisors.
=== Derivation ===

That is, any derivation formula_100 is equal to formula_101 for some formula_102; any formula_103 yields a derivation formula_101; if formula_105 satisfies formula_106, then formula_107.

The proof is similar to computing the potential function for a conservative polynomial vector field on the plane.
Since the commutator is a derivation in both of its entries, formula_101 is a derivation for any formula_103. Uniqueness up to additive scalar is because the center of formula_110 is the ring of scalars.

It remains to prove that any derivation is an inner derivation by induction on formula_111.

Base case: Let formula_112 be a linear map that is a derivation. We construct an element formula_113 such that formula_114. Since both formula_100 and formula_116 are derivations, these two relations generate formula_117 for all formula_118.

Since formula_95, there exists an element formula_120 such that formula_121 

formula_122 

Thus, formula_123 for some polynomial formula_124. Now, since formula_94, there exists some polynomial formula_126 such that formula_127. Since formula_128, formula_129 is the desired element.

For the induction step, similarly to the above calculation, there exists some element formula_130 such that formula_131.

Similar to the above calculation, formula_132 for all formula_133. Since formula_134 is a derivation in both formula_135 and formula_136, formula_137 for all formula_138 and all formula_139. Here, formula_140 means the subalgebra generated by the elements.

Thus, formula_141, formula_142

Since formula_143 is also a derivation, by induction, there exists formula_144 such that formula_145 for all formula_139.

Since formula_147 commutes with formula_148, we have formula_149 for all formula_150, and so for all of formula_6.
== Representation theory ==
=== Zero characteristic ===
In the case that the ground field has characteristic zero, the &quot;n&quot;th Weyl algebra is a simple Noetherian domain. It has global dimension &quot;n&quot;, in contrast to the ring it deforms, Sym(&quot;V&quot;), which has global dimension 2&quot;n&quot;.

It has no finite-dimensional representations. Although this follows from simplicity, it can be more directly shown by taking the trace of &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) and &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) for some finite-dimensional representation &quot;σ&quot; (where ).
: formula_152
Since the trace of a commutator is zero, and the trace of the identity is the dimension of the representation, the representation must be zero dimensional.

In fact, there are stronger statements than the absence of finite-dimensional representations. To any finitely generated &quot;An&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, there is a corresponding subvariety Char(&quot;M&quot;) of called the &#x27;characteristic variety&#x27; whose size roughly corresponds to the size of &quot;M&quot; (a finite-dimensional module would have zero-dimensional characteristic variety). Then Bernstein&#x27;s inequality states that for &quot;M&quot; non-zero,
: formula_153
An even stronger statement is Gabber&#x27;s theorem, which states that Char(&quot;M&quot;) is a co-isotropic subvariety of for the natural symplectic form.

=== Positive characteristic ===
The situation is considerably different in the case of a Weyl algebra over a field of characteristic .

In this case, for any element &quot;D&quot; of the Weyl algebra, the element &quot;Dp&quot; is central, and so the Weyl algebra has a very large center. In fact, it is a finitely generated module over its center; even more so, it is an Azumaya algebra over its center. As a consequence, there are many finite-dimensional representations which are all built out of simple representations of dimension &quot;p&quot;.

== Generalizations ==
The ideals and automorphisms of formula_5 have been well-studied. The moduli space for its right ideal is known. However, the case for formula_6 is considerably harder and is related to the Jacobian conjecture.

For more details about this quantization in the case &quot;n&quot; = 1 (and an extension using the Fourier transform to a class of integrable functions larger than the polynomial functions), see Wigner–Weyl transform.

Weyl algebras and Clifford algebras admit a further structure of a *-algebra, and can be unified as even and odd terms of a superalgebra, as discussed in CCR and CAR algebras.

=== Affine varieties ===
Weyl algebras also generalize in the case of algebraic varieties. Consider a polynomial ring
: formula_156
Then a differential operator is defined as a composition of formula_157-linear derivations of formula_52. This can be described explicitly as the quotient ring
: formula_159

<text>In science and especially in mathematical studies, a variational principle is one that enables a problem to be solved using calculus of variations, which concerns finding functions that optimize the values of quantities that depend on those functions. For example, the problem of determining the shape of a hanging chain suspended at both ends—a catenary—can be solved using variational calculus, and in this case, the variational principle is the following: The solution is a function that minimizes the gravitational potential energy of the chain.

==History==

===Physics===

The history of the variational principle in classical mechanics started with Maupertuis&#x27;s principle in the 18th century.
===Math===
Felix Klein&#x27;s 1872 Erlangen program attempted to identify invariants under a group of transformations.

==Examples==
===In mathematics===
* Ekeland&#x27;s variational principle in mathematical optimization
* The finite element method
* The variation principle relating topological entropy and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.
===In physics===
* The Rayleigh–Ritz method for solving boundary-value problems in elasticity and wave propagation
* Fermat&#x27;s principle in geometrical optics
* Hamilton&#x27;s principle in classical mechanics
* Maupertuis&#x27; principle in classical mechanics
* The principle of least action in mechanics, electromagnetic theory, and quantum mechanics
* The variational method in quantum mechanics
* Hellmann–Feynman theorem
* Gauss&#x27;s principle of least constraint and Hertz&#x27;s principle of least curvature
* Hilbert&#x27;s action principle in general relativity, leading to the Einstein field equations.
* Palatini variation
* Hartree–Fock method
* Density functional theory

<text>The Reformists () are a political faction in Iran. Iran&#x27;s &quot;reform era&quot; is sometimes said to have lasted from 1997 to 2005—the length of President Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s two terms in office. The Council for Coordinating the Reforms Front is the main umbrella organization and coalition within the movement; however, there are reformist groups not aligned with the council, such as the Reformists Front. Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist, was elected president following the 2024 Iranian presidential election, and was subsequently confirmed by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on 28 July.

==Background==
===Organizations===
The 2nd of Khordad Movement usually refers not only to the coalition of 18 groups and political parties of the reforms front but to anyone else who was a supporter of the 1997 reform programs of Khatami. 

The reforms front consists of several political parties, some of the most famous including the following:
* Islamic Iran Participation Front: key figures are Mohammad Reza Khatami, Saeed Hajjarian, Alireza Alavitabar, Abbas Abdi, Mohsen Safaie-Farahani, Mohsen Aminzadeh, and Mostafa Tajzadeh. It has been described as the dominant member within the 2nd of Khordad Front, the &quot;main reformist party&quot;, and the party most closely associated with President Khatami.
* Association of Combatant Clerics (&quot;Majma&#x27;e Rowhaniyoon-e Mobarez&quot;): key figures are Mohammad Khatami, Hadi Khamenei, Majid Ansari, Mohammad Tavassoli, and Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha. It has been described as the &quot;main &#x27;reformist&#x27; clerical body.&quot;
* Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran Organization (&quot;Sāzmān-e Mojāhedin-e Enqelāb-e Eslāmi-e Irān&quot;): key figures are Behzad Nabavi, Mohsen Armin, Mohammad Salevati, and Feyzollah Arabsorkhi. The mojahedin have been called a &quot;key political group.&quot;

=== Ideas ===
Some Iranian intellectuals were involved in establishing a foundation for the movement. Perhaps the most influential figure was Abdolkarim Soroush. For many years, he was the only voice publicly criticizing the regime&#x27;s policies. His regular lectures at Tehran University used to enjoy the attendance of many of the Iranian students who later generated the 2nd of Khordad movement. Many famous figures of the movement belong to the Soroush circle. However, at the rise of 2nd of Khordad movement, Saeed Hajjarian acted as the main theorist behind the movement and the main strategist in Khatami&#x27;s camp.

The movement has been described as changing the key terms in public discourse: &quot;emperialism&quot; (imperialism), &quot;mostazafen&quot; (poor), &quot;jehad&quot; (jihad), &quot;mojahed&quot; (mujahideen), &quot;shahed&quot; (martyrdom), &quot;khish&quot; (roots), &quot;enqelab&quot; (revolution) and &quot;Gharbzadegi&quot; (Western intoxication), to some modern terms and concepts like: &quot;demokrasi&quot; (democracy), &quot;moderniyat&quot; (modernity), &quot;azadi&quot; (liberty), &quot;barabari&quot; (equality), &quot;jam&#x27;eh-e madani&quot; (civil society), &quot;hoquq-e beshar&quot; (human rights), &quot;mosharekat-e siyasi&quot; (political participation), &quot;Shahrvandi&quot; (citizenship), etc.

===Supporters===
The core of the reform movement is said to be made up of Islamic leftists disqualified from running for office as they were purged and generally disempowered by Islamic conservatives following the death of Imam Khomeini in 1989. Islamic leftists turned reformists include Abdolkarim Soroush, Saeed Hajjarian, Akbar Ganji, Ali Akbar Mohtashami-Pur, Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, Mohsen Mirdamadi, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, and the Anjoman-e-Eslami (Islamic Association) and Office for Strengthening Unity student groups.

Many institutions support the movement of reformation such as organizations like Organization of the Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution (OMIR) and the Majma’a Rohaneeyoon Mobarez or the Forum of the Militant Clergy, or Office for Fostering Unity and Freedom Movement of Iran. There were also many media outlets in support like the Iran-e-farda and kian magazinez.

Khatami&#x27;s support is said to have cut across regions and class lines with even some members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qom seminarians and Basij members voting for him. The core of his electoral support, however, came from the modern middle class, college students, women, and urban workers. For example, by 1995, about half of Iran&#x27;s 60.5 million people were too young to be alive at the time of the Islamic Revolution.

==Major events==
===1997 presidential election ===
The movement began with the May 23, 1997, surprise victory of Mohammad Khatami, &quot;a little known cleric&quot;, to the presidency on with almost 70% of the vote. 

Khatami is regarded as Iran&#x27;s first reformist president, since the focus of his campaign was on the rule of law, democracy and the inclusion of all Iranians in the political decision-making process.

===Assassination attempt on Saeed Hajjarian===
Very soon after the rise of the 2nd of Khordad movement, there was an attempted assassination of Saeed Hajjarian, the main strategist of the reformist camp. In March 2000, he was shot in the face on the doorstep of Tehran&#x27;s city council by a gunman who fled on a motorcycle with an accomplice. The bullet entered through his left cheek and lodged in his neck. He was not killed but was &quot;badly paralyzed&quot; for some time. During his coma, groups of young Iranians kept a vigil outside Sina hospital, where he was being treated. Due to this injury, Hajjarian now uses a walking frame, and his voice is distorted.

His convicted assailant Saeed Asgar, a young man who was reported to be a member of the Basij militia, served only a small part of his 15-year jail sentence.

=== Ganji and &quot;Red Eminence and Grey Eminences&quot; ===
&quot;Red Eminence and Grey Eminences&quot; ( &quot;Alijenabe Sorkhpoosh, Alijenabane Khakestari&quot;) is the name of a series of newspaper articles and a book written by Akbar Ganji under the responsibility of Saeed Hajjarian, in which he criticized former president Akbar Rafsanjani as the &quot;Red Eminence&quot; and the intelligence officers in his government, such as Ali Fallahian, as the &quot;Grey Eminences&quot;. His subsequent prosecution and conviction for &quot;anti-Islamic activities&quot; for his role in the publication of the book and articles cost Akbar Ganji six years of imprisonment.

===1999 local elections===
Reformist candidates did remarkably well in the 1999 local elections and received 75% of the vote.

===18th of Tir crisis (1999)===

The 18th of Tir (July 9) crisis, refers to a demonstration in Tehran University dormitory in reaction to closing Salam newspaper by the government. Demonstrations continued for a few days in most cities in Iran and in more than ninety-five countries worldwide. The demonstration ended in violence and the death of a young Iranian citizen along with many casualties. At the time, it was Iran&#x27;s biggest antigovernment demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
After attacking of the students of Tehran University by hardline vigilante group, Khatami delivered a speech three months later while defending of his reform programme and at the same time he insisted on the foundations of his government. He referred to the reformation of system from within with holding two elements of Islamic and republic.

=== 18th of Tir national day of protest (2003) ===
In 2003, Iran&#x27;s leading pro-democracy student group, the Daftar-e Tahkim-e-Vahdat called for a national day of protest on the 18th of Tir to commemorate the original 1999 protest. At least one observer believes it was the failure of this protest that &quot;delivered a fatal blow to the reform movement.&quot;

According to journalist Afshin Molavi, many Iranians hoped the day would lead to an uprising that would &quot;break the back&quot; of the hardliners, but instead the Islamic Republic &quot;employed violence, intimidation, and sophisticated carrot-and-stick approach to suck the wind out of the demonstrations.&quot; In addition to a show of force and numerous checkpoints, the state used sophisticated jamming technology to black out satellite all the television feed and allowed the holding of (rare) outdoor pop concerts to draw young people away from the demonstrations. Dartar-e Tahkim-e-Vahdat also hurt its cause by calling for foreigners, the UN,- to assist it against the government.

===6th Parliament (2000)===
In the Iranian parliamentary elections, 2000 to elect the 6th parliament, reformist enjoyed a majority (69.25%), or 26.8 million, of the 38.7 million voters who cast ballots in the February 18, 2000 first round. Ultimately reformists won 195 of the 290 Majlis seats in that election.

===7th Parliament (2004)===
In January 2004, shortly before the 2004 Iranian legislative elections (the 7th Parliament), the conservative Council of Guardians ended Iranian voters&#x27; continued support for reformists by banning about 2500 candidates, nearly half of the total, including 80 sitting Parliament deputies. More than 100 MPs resigned in protest and critics complained the move &quot;shattered any pretense of Iranian democracy&quot;.

===27 Khordad presidential election (2005)===

In the 27 Khordad presidential election (June 17, 2005), Mostafa Moin and Mehdi Karroubi were the main candidates of the 2nd of Khordad movement. However, neither made it to the second round of the election (the final runoff): Moin came in fifth and Karroubi third in the first round. As a result, many supporters of the reform movement lost hope and did not participate in the election.

===2009 Iranian presidential election===

The two leading reformist candidates in the 2009 presidential election were Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi. Mousavi supporters disbelieved the election results and initiated a series of protests that lasted several days. After many days of protesting against the election results, the protests eventually turned violent as the Basij (loyal militia to the Islamic Republic) started attacking the protesters and vice versa. Some protesters turned their anger to the government itself and tried to overthrow the Islamic Republic. The protests, in general, lasted up to several months.

=== 2024 Iranian Presidential Election ===
Masoud Pezeshkian was elected in a special election after the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash on 19 May 2024. He secured nearly 16.4 million of the more than 30 million votes cast, beating his main rival Saeed Jalili who received approximately 13.5 million in a run-off election, according to the official count. The election was generally seen as an upset victory for the Reformists&#x27; Party with many political observers expecting low voter turnout. Pezeshkian is described as a centrist, in stark contrast to his predecessor, Raisi, who was described as a &quot;hard-liner.&quot; He has promised several economic, political, and cultural reforms; however, several obstacles remain in the way, primarily Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who retains decision authority on all major state issues.

==Obstacles to the Movement ==

The Reformists&#x27; Party often struggles with realizing its agenda as described by &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine:

Dozens of newspapers opened during the Khatami period, only for many to be shut down on one pretext or another by the judiciary. Clerics who took advantage of the new atmosphere to question the doctrine of velayat-e faqih [Islamic government] were imprisoned or otherwise cowed. Even as political debate blossomed, Iran&#x27;s security services cracked down on religious and ethnic minorities. A number of the government&#x27;s critics fell victim to murders traced later to the interior ministry. In 1999 police reacted to a peaceful demonstration for freer speech by invading Tehran University, beating and arresting hundreds of students and killing at least one. In the majlis (parliament) much of the president&#x27;s reforming legislation was vetoed by the Council of Guardians, a committee of clerics appointed by the supreme leader to ensure that laws conform with Islamic precepts.

Saeed Hajjarian, the main theorist behind the movement, declared in 2003 that &quot;the reform movement is dead. Long live the reform movement&quot;.

The victory of conservatives in the 2005 presidential election and the 2004 Majlis election can be explained &quot;not so much&quot; by an expansion of &quot;their limited core base as by [their] dividing of the reformers and [their] discouraging them from voting,&quot; according to political historian Ervand Abrahamian: The conservatives won in part because they retained their 25% base; in part because they recruited war veterans to run as their candidates; in part because they wooed independents on the issue of national security; but in most part because large numbers of women, college students, and other members of the salaried middle class stayed home. Turnout in the Majles elections fell below 51% - one of the worst since the revolution. In Tehran, it fell to 28%.

===Limitations===

The reform movement has been lamented as &quot;too divided to establish its own political authority, too naïve about the tenacity of the authoritarian elite around Khamenei, and too inflexible to circumvent the ban on political parties in Iran by creating and sustaining alternative forms of mobilisation.&quot; In addition, leaders of the reform movement lacked a clear and coherent strategy of establishing durable and extensive linkages with the public.

Ironically, they became a victim of their electoral successes. The reform movement&#x27;s &quot;control of both the presidency and parliament from 2000 to 2004 made it look inept and a part of the corrupt system in the eyes of many Iranians.&quot;

=== Secularism ===
BBC journalist Jonathan Beale reports that since secularism is banned in Iran, it is an ideology that is mostly followed by political organizations among the Iranian diaspora or by many of the anti-sharia political parties in exile that are secular. These parties promote regime change, most often with foreign aid and military intervention (particularity from the United States). He quotes a former leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, Mohsen Sazegara (also one of its founders), as saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t interfere. Leave these affairs to the Iranian people&quot;. Sazegara believes the US should call for democracy and freedom, and let Iranian opposition groups inside Iran, which are Reformists, take the lead, instead of attempting to create an opposition in exile.

====Referendum movement====
The Referendum movement calls in effect for a rerun of the 1979 referendum that established the Islamic Republic in Iran: &quot;a &#x27;yes or no&#x27; vote on whether today&#x27;s Iranians still want the authoritarian Islamic Republic that another generation&#x27;s revolution brought them.&quot; It is said to have been born out of &quot;the ashes of the failures of Khatami&#x27;s Islamic democracy movement&quot; and reflected in one-word graffiti on walls in Tehran saying &quot;no&quot;. It has been criticized as calling for complete system change without &quot;building the political and organisational network to back it up&quot; and inviting a brutal crackdown, with &quot;no means on the ground to resist it&quot;.

<text>Foothill Transit is a public transit agency that is government funded by 22 member cities in the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys. It operates a fixed-route bus public transit service in the San Gabriel Valley region of eastern Los Angeles County, California, United States, as well as a rapid bus route to and from downtown Los Angeles from the El Monte Busway, and a few of its local routes reach the far northern and western edge cities of neighboring Orange and San Bernardino counties, respectively. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== Overview ==

Foothill Transit operates out of two yards: one in Pomona (opened in 1997), and the other in Arcadia (opened in 2002); the administrative offices moved to West Covina in 2007. The Foothill Transit joint powers authority membership consists of elected representatives from 22 member cities in the San Gabriel Valley and Pomona Valley and three members appointed from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. These representatives are divided into five geographical clusters, which each elect a representative annually to serve on a five-member executive board.

=== Funding ===
Foothill Transit is mainly funded by local sales tax revenue, with 75% coming from Los Angeles County Propositions A and C, California State Transportation Development Act, and the State Transit Assistance Fund. The remaining 25% comes from farebox revenue.

== History ==
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum is credited with the formation of the transit agency. Schabarum, annoyed by what he saw as disproportionate cutbacks of bus service by the Southern California Rapid Transit District (SCRTD) in the San Gabriel Valley, wanted to secede from the larger agency and form a separate transit agency as early as 1986. Compared to routes serving more densely-populated areas, routes in the San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys required greater subsidies to serve fewer riders on longer freeway alignments in eastern Los Angeles County.

Foothill was initially founded by 20 member cities; Pasadena voted to join in 1998. In 1987, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) approved Foothill to take over fourteen routes which serviced the San Gabriel Valley that were currently operated by SCRTD. Although service was planned to start on July 1, 1988, the Foothill Transit Zone had been prevented from starting service in July by an injunction arising from a lawsuit filed by the drivers and mechanics unions (United Transportation and Amalgamated Transit Unions) of SCRTD against LACTC. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow ruled that LACTC could not unilaterally transfer the lines without the consent of the SCRTD board of directors. The injunction was upheld on appeal.

LACTC had begun withholding $9 million per month from SCRTD in April 1988 on the basis that SCRTD had not followed salary guidelines set by LACTC; SCRTD replied that LACTC, under the leadership of its chairman (Schabarum), was holding the funds hostage to pressure SCRTD to release the lines to Foothill Transit. SCRTD consented to Foothill Transit taking over the bus lines in December 1988 in return for the restoration of funding. Those first two lines operated by Foothill Transit were 495 and 498.

The trial for the lawsuit against Foothill Transit started in May 1989, was resolved in Foothill&#x27;s favor by July, and the other twelve lines previously operated by SCRTD were transitioned to Foothill Transit between 1989 and 1992. For a short period in 1992, the last two routes to transition (486 and 488) were operated by both Foothill Transit and SCRTD during continued legal disputes. The drivers and mechanics unions disputed the transfer of 486 and 488 since SCRTD had made the decision without negotiating with the union; an arbitrator held up the unions&#x27; argument, which led to duplicated service on those lines, as &quot;Foothill Transit [had] the legal right to operate buses on the contested routes, but the [SCRTD had] the legal obligation to do so&quot;, and the union planned to use that precedent to roll back service to SCRTD on all fourteen lines. However, Foothill Transit again prevailed in a February 1993 court ruling.

=== Contract labor ===
Schabarum, who hated the influence of trade unions, chose to use contractors to operate and manage the service. All of the operations and maintenance work for Foothill Transit are contracted out. , bus service is operated by Keolis at Pomona and Transdev at Arcadia/Irwindale.

Embree Bus Lines was the initial contractor that operated the first two lines for Foothill starting in December 1988. The hourly operating cost under Foothill Transit was reduced by up to half compared to service under SCRTD, and ridership grew, but the contract operator drivers generally earned less in both wages and fringe benefits, and had less influence over working conditions. In addition, Foothill Transit was not required to provide typical rider services such as schedules, bus stops, transit police, or telephone information. During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Foothill Transit terminated service at El Monte rather than continue on to downtown Los Angeles. Over the first five years, Foothill Transit consistently saved money compared to SCRTD&#x27;s historical costs. In 1994, Foothill reported their hourly cost of operations was $55, compared to $93 for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), with a farebox recovery ratio of 48% (compared to 32% for Metro) at a lower fare of $0.85 (compared to $1.10 for Metro, which was scheduled to increase to $1.35 later that year). In addition, Foothill reported an accident rate of 0.3 per traveled, compared to Metro&#x27;s rate of 3.3 per , although Metro&#x27;s accident rate was skewed by older buses and more dense traffic in its operating area.

Foothill executives made the service essentially strike-proof by insisting that two different companies operate the two bus yards, even if it would cost more in the short term. By 1998, Foothill&#x27;s contractors were Laidlaw and Ryder/ATE. However, due to bus industry consolidation, First Transit operated both yards from 2001 to mid-2007. Currently, both Foothill Transit yards are represented by unions (Arcadia by the Amalgamated Transit Union and Pomona by the Teamsters Union), but past strikes at the agency have been less than successful due to the ability of one yard to operate the other yard&#x27;s service. In addition, wages are less at Foothill than at other transit operators in the region.

The contract operator drivers at Foothill were also represented by the Teamsters, but a 1994 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article reported they earned an average of $11 per hour, compared to the average $18.45 per hour earned by Metro drivers. A representative of the union representing Metro&#x27;s drivers, the United Transportation Union, accused Foothill of not paying its drivers a living wage; the president of the company that was then contracted to manage Foothill, William P. Forsythe, stated the typical annual pay of a Foothill driver &quot;isn&#x27;t bad for a service industry job&quot; and admitted it wasn&#x27;t fair &quot;compared to MTA, but they&#x27;ve been overpaying for years.&quot; In January 1995, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the majority of the 150 drivers for Laidlaw made $8.50 per hour; those drivers, represented by the Teamsters, rejected a proposed contract that offered no wage increases.

Laidlaw, which was responsible for approximately half of Foothill&#x27;s fleet, operated out of the Upland Yard. The first strike against Foothill Transit started when Laidlaw drivers walked off in February 1996, asking for an immediate $1/hour raise and full medical coverage. Teamsters Local 848 officials stated that drivers could not afford private health insurance, and had to rely on county services instead. Foothill&#x27;s other contractor was not affected and continued normal operations during the strike. The strike ended after thirteen days, when drivers accepted a 3% pay raise with no health coverage on a one-year contract under the threat they would be fired and replaced if they did not return to work. Shortly after the expiration of the contract, Laidlaw drivers went on strike again in June 1997, but that strike was settled within hours, as most drivers were no longer represented by the union. The reported average wages in 1998 was $9.30 per hour for Ryder/ATE drivers (represented by the Teamsters), and $9.06 per hour for Laidlaw drivers (who had previously voted to become an open shop). 

Forsythe&#x27;s company later merged with what became Veolia. Effective July 1, 2013, due to expiration of the existing management services contract and continuing conflicts of interest between the executive director, staff, and board, Foothill Transit transitioned to in house management. Executive Director Doran Barnes became the first full-time Foothill employee, and planning, procurement, and other administrative functions became Foothill functions as well. Transdev (formerly Veolia) staff continues to operate the transit stores and maintain bus shelters.

The last two lines operated by Metro (SCRTD&#x27;s successor) in the eastern San Gabriel Valley were turned over to Foothill in 2016.

In 2017, Foothill Transit hired two new contractors, Keolis and Transdev, both of which are French transportation companies, to manage both of their bus storage yards. Keolis took over First Transit&#x27;s role in managing the Pomona Yard and Transdev took over First Transit&#x27;s, and previously MV Transportation&#x27;s, role in managing the Irwindale Yard.

=== Environmental initiatives ===
In 2002, Foothill Transit began purchasing Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) powered buses. In 2010, Foothill Transit was the first transit system to operate an all-electric battery-powered bus from Proterra. By 2013, when the last diesel-powered 2000–2001 Gillig Advantage buses were retired, Foothill Transit became around a 90 percent CNG fleet. 10 percent of the fleet is electric.

Foothill Transit&#x27;s main goal is to be fully electric by 2030. On January 25, 2021, Foothill Transit received its first two all-electric double-decker buses, which were made by Alexander Dennis in the United Kingdom.

==== Fleet Reliability Problems ====

During its transition to an all Electric Fleet, Foothill Transit suffered a thirty-four percent electric fleet failure rate. The transit system blamed its fleet vendor for the lack of spare parts. Other units stalled while in revenue service and a bus caught on fire in early 2020.
In Fiscal Year 2020, sixty-seven percent of its electric fleet failed to properly operate. Most of the buses had to wait three hundred days for replacement parts. 

In 2021, Foothill Transit voted to return its fleet of Electric Buses to the FTA. Foothill Transit took a $5,000,000 charge off, due to its reduced life cycle.

=== Fuel Cell Fleet ===

In 2021, Foothill transit ordered 13 Fuel Cell buses from New flyer to replace its Electric buses The Fuel Cell Buses began revenue service in December 2022

<doc id="491102" wikidata="Q7943154" url="?curid=491102" title="Vroman's Bookstore">
<text>Vroman&#x27;s Bookstore is reportedly the oldest and largest independent bookstore by multiple news media reporters in Southern California.

The store hosts over 400 free community events a year including children&#x27;s storytimes, trivia nights, craft classes, bake-offs, and launch parties, and has hosted such authors as President Bill Clinton, President Jimmy Carter, Irving Stone, Upton Sinclair, Ray Bradbury, David Sedaris, Salman Rushdie, Walter Mosley, Joan Didion, Barbara Walters, Anne Rice, Neil Gaiman, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and Bernie Sanders.

==Background==
Founded in 1894 by Adam Clark Vroman, the original Vroman&#x27;s Book and Photographic Supply store was located at 60 E. Colorado St in Pasadena, California. Mr. Vroman loved books and loved giving back to his community. Mr. Vroman was also a passionate photographer, specializing in scenes of the American West and his portraits of Native Americans. When Mr. Vroman died in 1916, he left the bookstore to long-time employees.

During World War II, Vroman&#x27;s donated and delivered books to Japanese Americans interned at nearby camps, such as the Manzanar camp in Owens Valley.

In 2008, Vroman&#x27;s was named Bookseller of the Year by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, an international news magazine of book publishing.

In 2009, Vroman&#x27;s bought another beloved independent bookstore, Book Soup in West Hollywood, after its owner died and the store was in danger of closing.

In 2020, Vroman&#x27;s Bookstore itself was in danger of closing due to a significant drop in sales resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.

<doc id="491108" wikidata="Q16972878" url="?curid=491108" title="Herbie Husker">
<text>Herbie Husker is the oldest active mascot of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Herbie first appeared on the cover of a football media guide in 1974 and became the school&#x27;s official mascot in 1977. Though primarily used for athletic events, Herbie also appears at academic and extracurricular events around Lincoln. He is depicted as a burly farmer wearing overalls and carrying a football, and is often seen with Lil&#x27; Red.

==Earlier mascots==
The University of Nebraska used many unofficial mascots in its early decades, most often a variation of an anthropomorphic ear of corn named Cornhead Guy, Johnnie Husker, or Old Man Cornhusker. The earliest mascot to appear on the sideline (not just as a logo) was Corncob Man, a man in green overalls with an ear of corn for a head who debuted in 1955. Early in the 1960s the university sought a more &quot;representative&quot; mascot and debuted Husky the Husker, a ten-foot-tall farmer who wore overalls with a straw hat on top of a fiberglass head. On the orders of Bob Devaney, Husky soon gave way to Mr. Big Red (more commonly known as Harry Husker), who was developed by cartoonist Bill Goggins and first appeared in an edition of the Nebraska Farmer. Harry was nearly as tall as Husky but wore a red blazer and wide-brim cowboy hat, a tribute to Devaney&#x27;s tenure as head coach at Wyoming. Harry&#x27;s six-foot head could not fit on the team&#x27;s traveling bus, and at seventy pounds it was so heavy that the student wearing the costume had to be switched every forty-five minutes.

==History==
Artist Dirk West created a series of Big Eight-themed cartoons for use at the 1974 Cotton Bowl Classic between Nebraska and Texas. NU associate athletic director Don Bryant saw West&#x27;s interpretation of a Cornhusker – an enormous, clumsy farmer smiling and holding a football – on a wall in the press box and hired him to refine it into a new mascot. He later enlisted Disney cartoonist Bob Johnson to turn West&#x27;s design into a costume. &quot;Herbie Husker&quot; made his first appearance on the cover of Nebraska&#x27;s 1974 football media guide and was adopted as the school&#x27;s first official mascot in 1977. Mr. Big Red wasn&#x27;t retired until 1988, but was seen infrequently while co-existing with Herbie.

Since 1993, Herbie has often been joined by the inflatable Lil&#x27; Red, Nebraska&#x27;s other official mascot. Lil&#x27; Red was created to appeal to younger fans and primarily represent the school&#x27;s volleyball team, which occasionally played at the same time as its football team. Athletic director Bill Byrne ended the use of Herbie in 1995, hoping to remove any negative perception of the university while suggesting the mascot was &quot;not nationally marketable&quot; (Byrne also pushed to rebrand Nebraska as the &quot;Huskers&quot; instead of the &quot;Cornhuskers&quot;). Herbie was reinstated after Byrne&#x27;s departure and is now used alongside Lil&#x27; Red across all sports. Nebraska says Herbie and Lil&#x27; Red are not intended to be related, but describes them as &quot;best friends.&quot;

Nebraska holds open tryouts prior to each football season for students who wish to dress as Herbie in the upcoming academic year. Typically three to five students are selected and they are encouraged to keep their identity a secret until after graduation, though this is not a requirement. Herbie appears at all football, basketball, and volleyball games with occasional appearances at other sporting events in Lincoln.

===Appearance===
Herbie is a blond-haired, blue-eyed farmer with a pronounced barrel chest and a cleft chin. He dresses in denim overalls, a white undershirt, and a red cowboy hat with an ear of corn in his pocket. Nebraska used the same Herbie costume for decades after his creation, and as a result his appearance changed slightly each year as the costume aged and was repaired.

In 2003, athletic director Steve Pederson led an effort to rebrand Herbie and update the overall presentation of the state&#x27;s agricultural workers and general public, just as his predecessor Byrne had done. Herbie&#x27;s trimmed-down appearance, altered to include brown hair, a red work shirt, and blue jeans, was not well-received. Most of the modifications were reverted in 2023. In logo form, Herbie typically holds a football in his right arm, but various sport-specific versions exist.

In 2022, the university modified the left hand of its Herbie logo, traditionally giving an OK gesture, to avoid association with a perceived hate symbol.

==Awards and popular culture==
Herbie starred in a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Hello, Herbie Husker!&quot;, written by Aimee Aryal and published by Mascot Books in January 2005. Herbie guides the reader through Nebraska landmarks before finishing at Memorial Stadium on a football gameday.

Herbie was named the 2005 National Mascot of the year at halftime of the 2006 Capital One Bowl.

<doc id="491117" wikidata="Q1241630" url="?curid=491117" title="Purple Haze">
<text>&quot;Purple Haze&quot; is a song written by Jimi Hendrix and released as the second single by the Jimi Hendrix Experience on March 17, 1967, in the United Kingdom.
The song features his inventive guitar playing, which uses the signature Hendrix chord and a mix of blues and Eastern modalities, shaped by novel sound processing techniques. Because of ambiguities in the lyrics, listeners often interpret the song as referring to a psychedelic experience, although Hendrix described it as a love song. It was included as the opening track in the North American edition of the Experience&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; (1967).

&quot;Purple Haze&quot; is one of Hendrix&#x27;s best-known songs and appears on many Hendrix compilation albums. The song featured regularly in concerts and each of Hendrix&#x27;s group configurations issued live recordings. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and is included on lists of the greatest guitar songs, including at number two by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and number one by &quot;Q&quot; magazine. In 2004 and 2010, the former ranked it at number 17 on its “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time ” list, re-ranking it to number 250 in the 2021 edition.

==Background and recording==
By January 5, 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, backed with &quot;Stone Free&quot;, had peaked at number six on the UK record chart. &quot;Hey Joe&quot; was not a Hendrix composition – it was written by Billy Roberts and recorded by several groups prior to the Experience. Hendrix commented, &quot;That record isn&#x27;t us. The next one&#x27;s gonna be different. We&#x27;re working on an LP which will mainly be our stuff.&quot; The group recorded several demos of original material at studios in London, including &quot;Can You See Me&quot;, &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot;, &quot;Red House&quot;, and &quot;Remember&quot;. In the middle of December, producer Chas Chandler heard Hendrix toying around with a new guitar riff. &quot;I heard him playing it at the flat and was knocked out. I told him to keep working on that, saying, &#x27;That&#x27;s the next single! Chandler claimed that after some more urging, Hendrix wrote the rest of &quot;Purple Haze&quot; in the dressing room of a London club during the afternoon of December 26, 1966, before a gig. In several interviews, Hendrix spoke about writing the song, but did not mention where or when he wrote it.

The Experience began recording &quot;Purple Haze&quot; on January 11, 1967, at De Lane Lea Studios in London. According to drummer Mitch Mitchell, he and bassist Noel Redding learned the song in the studio: &quot;Hendrix came in and kind of hummed us the riff and showed Noel the chords and the changes. I listened to it and we went, &#x27;OK, let&#x27;s do it.&#x27; We got it on the third take as I recall.&quot; The basic track was recorded in four hours, according to Chandler. Multitrack recording technology allowed engineers to record and complete additional parts on the final master. After the basic track was finished, Chandler explained that he and Hendrix developed the song:
 Redding and Mitchell were not included in the process because Chandler felt that it was more efficient for him and Hendrix to do it alone. To get a better quality recording, Chandler took the four-track tape recorded at De Lane Lea to Olympic Studios for overdubbing (although Hendrix had worked with eight-track recording in the US, it was not yet available in the UK). At Olympic, they were assigned Eddie Kramer, who, as a sound engineer, played an important role in subsequent Hendrix recordings. Hendrix added new vocals and guitar parts between February 3 and 8, 1967. Unlike the conventional techniques used by the Experience to record previous songs, Chandler decided to try out new effects and sounds for &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. He enhanced background sounds (some contributed by Redding) by playing them back through headphones, which were moved around the recording microphone, creating &quot;a weird echo&quot;. Chandler also used sped-up guitar parts recorded at half-speed (which also raises the pitch) and panning to create novel effects. The guitar solo features the first use of the Octavia guitar effects unit. Acoustical and electronics engineer Roger Mayer developed the unit with input from Hendrix. The Octavia doubles the frequency of the sound it is fed, essentially adding an upper octave.

==Lyrics and interpretation==
In interviews, Hendrix usually gave different answers about the development of the song&#x27;s lyrics. Biographer Harry Shapiro points out that &quot;Purple Haze&quot; is most likely &quot;a pot-pourri of ideas&quot; which Hendrix developed over time. As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting. Hendrix read &quot;Night of Light&quot;, a 1966 novel by Philip José Farmer, that expanded on a short story published in 1957. In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a &quot;purplish haze&quot; which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants. An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled &quot;Purple Haze – Jesus Saves&quot;, uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted. In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, &quot;I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs. I wrote one called &#x27;First Look Around the Corner&#x27; and another called &#x27;The Purple Haze,&#x27; which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.&quot; He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song:

So far, only a crumpled single sheet of ruled yellow tablet paper is on exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and does not include any of the lyrics used in the Experience song. Chandler admitted that in the early stages, he helped Hendrix shape the songs and lyrics to radio single length. Biographer Keith Shadwick comments that although much of the complexity may have been sacrificed, it resulted in verses that are &quot;simple, focused and striking&quot;.
After its release, Hendrix offered another explanation: &quot;He [the song&#x27;s protagonist] likes this girl so much, that he doesn&#x27;t know what [state] he&#x27;s in, ya know. A sort of daze, I suppose. That&#x27;s what the song is all about.&quot; This draws on an experience Hendrix had while still in New York, where he felt that a girl was attempting to use voodoo to trap him and he became ill. Shapiro believes that this is reflected in most of the first two verses:
Many fans and the press interpret the song as referring to a psychedelic experience due to lines such as &quot;purple haze all in my brain&quot; and scuse me while I kiss the sky&quot;. However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between psychedelic drugs and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at the time, to do so would have been &quot;professional suicide&quot;. Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while under the influence of psychedelics. Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes &quot;the music [was allowed] to tell the larger story. Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener&#x27;s taste&quot;. In concert, Hendrix sometimes substituted lyrics for comic effect; scuse me while I kiss the sky&quot; was rendered scuse me while I kiss this guy&quot; (while gesturing towards Mitchell), scuse me while I kiss that policeman&quot; (at a near riot in Los Angeles), or scuse me while I fuck the sky&quot; (during a downpour in Seattle).

==Composition==
Music critic William Ruhlmann describes &quot;Purple Haze&quot; as having &quot;relentlessly driving, if relatively slow-paced underlying music, which provides a good platform for some of Hendrix&#x27;s inventive guitar playing&quot;. Beginning with its dissonant opening and heavy use of distortion, Hendrix&#x27;s techniques &quot;all contributed to the dirty, raw, metallic, [and] angular sounds&quot; heard in the song, according to Shapiro. The intro consists of the melodic interval of a tritone or diminished (sometimes called flattened) fifth. Historically, this dissonant interval has been referred to as &quot;diabolus in musica&quot; (literally &quot;Devil in music&quot;). It is sounded during the first two measures by Hendrix playing a B on guitar against an E played by Redding on bass, followed by the respective octaves. Mitchell on drums comes in for the third measure, when Hendrix introduces the riff that piqued Chandler&#x27;s interest, and Redding continues playing the octaves in E.

After the riff, the verse sections begin, which Shadwick describe as &quot;simplicity itself, consisting of just three chords&quot;: E79, G, and A. The E79, or dominant seventh sharp ninth chord, has come to be called the &quot;Hendrix chord&quot; by guitarists and was used primarily in rhythm and blues and jazz before Hendrix helped popularize it. He also used an unconventional fingering technique for the G and A chords. Because Hendrix used his thumb to fret the roots of the G and A chords on the sixth string, his fingers were left in a position to create different chord voicings. Instead of the usual G barre chord (G–D–G–B–D–G), a G5 (G–X–G–G–D–G) is sometimes played with the major third (B) being muted on the fifth string and replaced by the open third string (G). Redding follows the chord changes mostly by playing the root with occasional passing notes, while Mitchell heightens the tension with drum flourishes that accentuate Hendrix&#x27;s vocal and guitar.

Em Casalena of American Songwriter wrote, &quot;for lack of a better descriptor, [the song sounds] alien. Or at least, it was alien when it was released back in 1967.&quot; Biographer David Henderson describes Hendrix&#x27;s guitar tone on the track as &quot;at the razor edge of distort&quot;. However, individual notes are still clear, as well as the harmonically more complex chords, even with the use of extreme overdrive for the time. The tension is maintained until the guitar solo, which &quot;arrives as something of a release rather than a further racking up of the atmosphere.&quot; It is also when Hendrix first introduces the Octavia, coupled with a Fuzz Face distortion unit. Whitehill describes the solo as &quot;almost sound[ing] likes he&#x27;s playing a blues raga. He starts out playing in the Mixolydian mode and then he goes right into the blues side. The Octavia has the effect of a sitar, kind of like Ravi Shankar meets B.B. King.&quot; During the song&#x27;s outro, the guitar part recorded at 7½ inches per second (ips) played back at 15 ips, is combined with the Octavia, further extending the guitar&#x27;s upper frequency range. Henderson describes it as &quot;an uncanny piercing tone that takes off, Eastern-sounding beyond the range of the guitar&quot; and, according to Shadwick, &quot;gives the impression that the guitar notes are flying off into the ether.&quot;
==Releases and charts==
On March 17, 1967, &quot;Purple Haze&quot; was released in the UK as the first single on Track Records. Another Hendrix composition, the R&amp;B-influenced &quot;51st Anniversary&quot; was included as the B-side. Paul McCartney, who was an early Hendrix supporter, gave the record an enthusiastic pre-release review in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. The single entered the charts at number 39 on &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and at number 43 on &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. It peaked at number three and spent 14 weeks on the chart. During March 1967, several performances of &quot;Purple Haze&quot; were filmed to promote the song and used for television programs, such as &quot;Beat-Club&quot;, &quot;Dee Time&quot;, and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Live performances were also broadcast on German NDR and BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Club&quot;. In 2022, the British Phonographic Industry awarded &quot;Purple Haze&quot; its Gold certification, signifying sales of over 400,000.

For the American single, Reprise Records paired the song with &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;. It was released on June 19, 1967, the day following the Experience&#x27;s performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. The single entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart on August 26, where it spent eight weeks and reached number 65. &quot;Purple Haze&quot; was included as the opening track on the American release of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; on August 23, 1967. Because of the song&#x27;s airplay on underground FM radio, the album became more popular than Hendrix&#x27;s singles.

One of Hendrix&#x27;s most popular songs, &quot;Purple Haze&quot; appears on numerous compilation albums. Some of these include &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, &quot;The Essential Jimi Hendrix&quot;, &quot;The Singles Album&quot;, &quot;Kiss the Sky&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Ultimate Experience&quot;, &quot;Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix&quot;, &quot;Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection&quot;, and &quot;The Singles Collection&quot;. An alternative version recorded at the same time, but with different vocal and guitar overdubs, is the first song on &quot;The Jimi Hendrix Experience&quot; 2000 box set. Live recordings of &quot;Purple Haze&quot; as performed by each of the different Hendrix lineups have been released. These include &quot;Live at Monterey&quot; (the Experience), &quot;Live at Woodstock&quot; (Gypsy Sun and Rainbows), &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot; (Band of Gypsys), and &quot;Live at Berkeley&quot; (the Cry of Love touring group). Additional live recordings with the Experience appear on &quot;Winterland&quot; (2011 &quot;Billboard&quot; number 49 album) and &quot;Miami Pop Festival&quot; (2013 &quot;Billboard&quot; number 39 album).
==Recognition and influence==
In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Purple Haze&quot; at number one in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever!&quot; The song placed at number two on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot; list, which noted that the song &quot;unveiled a new guitar language charged with spiritual hunger and the poetry possible in electricity and studio technology&quot;. It also appeared at number 17 on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list in 2004, with the comment that &quot;it launched not one but two revolutions: late-Sixties psychedelia and the unprecedented genius of Jimi Hendrix&quot;. It was re-ranked to number 250 on the 2021 edition of the list. Author and music critic Dave Marsh called it the &quot;debut single of the Album Rock Era&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Purple Haze&quot; was included as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. NPR named the song to its list of the &quot;100 Most Important American Musical Works of the 20th Century&quot; in 2000. In 2000, it was given a Grammy Hall of Fame Award, which &quot;honor[s] recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Far Out&quot; ranked the song number one on their list of the 20 greatest Jimi Hendrix songs, and in 2021, &quot;American Songwriter&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 10 greatest Jimi Hendrix songs.

Many musicians have recorded their interpretations of the song, making it one of Hendrix&#x27;s most covered songs. Dion DiMucci included an acoustic version with strings on his 1968 comeback album &quot;Dion&quot;. Released as a single in 1969, it appeared at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which was two positions higher than Hendrix&#x27; single in 1967. In Canada, where Hendrix&#x27;s single did not reach the charts, Dion&#x27;s version reached number 72. Also with a new arrangement, the Cure recorded it for the various artist&#x27;s &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot; in 1993. Their rendition reached number two on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Modern Rock Tracks alternative rock chart. &quot;Purple Haze&quot; has achieved an unusual level of interest among classical musicians. The Meridian Arts Ensemble, the Hampton String Quartet, and Nigel Kennedy have recorded their interpretations and the Kronos Quartet often play it as an encore.

<text>The fishing industry includes any industry or activity that takes, cultures, processes, preserves, stores, transports, markets or sells fish or fish products. It is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization as including recreational, subsistence and commercial fishing, as well as the related harvesting, processing, and marketing sectors. The commercial activity is aimed at the delivery of fish and other seafood products for human consumption or as input factors in other industrial processes. The livelihood of over 500 million people in developing countries depends directly or indirectly on fisheries and aquaculture.

The fishing industry is struggling with environmental and welfare issues, including overfishing and occupational safety. Additionally, the combined pressures of climate change, biodiversity loss and overfishing endanger the livelihoods and food security of a substantial portion of the global population. Stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels decreased from 90% in 1974 to 62.3% in 2021.

==Sectors==

The industry has three principal sectors that include recreational, subsistence or traditional, and commercial fishing.
* The commercial sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with wild-catch or aquaculture resources and the various transformations of those resources into products for sale. It is also referred to as the seafood industry, although non-food items such as pearls are included among its products.
* The traditional sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with fisheries resources from which aboriginal people derive products in accordance with their traditions.
* The recreational sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated for the purpose of recreation, sport or sustenance with fisheries resources from which products are derived that are not for sale.

===Commercial sector===

== World production ==

Fish are harvested by commercial fishing and aquaculture. Stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels decreased from 90% in 1974 to 62.3% in 2021.

The world harvest increased over the 20th century and, by 1986, had stabilized around per year. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the world harvest in 2005 consisted of captured by commercial fishing in wild fisheries, plus produced by fish farms. In addition, of aquatic plants (seaweed etc.) were captured in wild fisheries and were produced by aquaculture. The number of individual fish caught in the wild has been estimated at 0.97–2.7 trillion per year (not counting fish farms or marine invertebrates).

Following is a table of the 2011 world fishing industry harvest in tonnes (metric tons) by capture and by aquaculture.

==Related industries==
Once fish is caught, especially in commercial sectors, bringing the fish to consumers require a complex series of related industries.

===Fish processing===
Fish processing is the processing of fish delivered by commercial fisheries and fish farms. The larger fish processing companies have their own fishing fleets and independent fisheries. The products of the industry are usually sold wholesale to grocery chains or to intermediaries.

Fish processing can be subdivided into two categories: fish handling (the initial processing of raw fish) and fish products manufacturing. Aspects of fish processing occur on fishing vessels, fish processing vessels, and at fish processing plants.

Another natural subdivision is into primary processing involved in the filleting and freezing of fresh fish for onward distribution to fresh fish retail and catering outlets, and the secondary processing that produces chilled, frozen and canned products for the retail and catering trades.

===Fish products===
Fisheries are estimated to currently provide 16% of the world population&#x27;s protein. The flesh of many fish are primarily valued as a source of food; there are many edible species of fish. Other marine life taken as food includes shellfish, crustaceans, sea cucumber, jellyfish and roe.

Fish and other marine life can also be used for many other uses: pearls and mother-of-pearl, sharkskin and rayskin. Sea horses, star fish, sea urchins and sea cucumber are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Tyrian purple is a pigment made from marine snails, and sepia is a pigment made from the inky secretions of cuttlefish. Fish glue has long been valued for its use in all manner of products. Isinglass is used for the clarification of wine and beer. Fish emulsion is a fertilizer emulsion that is produced from the fluid remains of fish processed for fish oil and fish meal.

Fish derived protein hydrolysates have been identified to exhibit a wide range of bioactivities making them important to food and health care industries. Hydrolysates derived from fish processing by-products like swim bladder, skin, scale, bones and fins display blood pressure regulatory, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory and anti-cancer activity. Fish hydrolysates are also on the rise for commercial purposes in food industries due to their lipid peroxidation inhibition, high emulsification activity and large water retention capacity making them effective food matrix stabilization and shelf life enhancement agents.

In the industry, the term &quot;seafood products&quot; is often used instead of &quot;fish products&quot;.

===Fish marketing===
Fish markets are marketplace used for the trade in and sale of fish and other seafood. They can be dedicated to wholesale trade between fishermen and fish merchants, or to the sale of seafood to individual consumers, or to both. Retail fish markets, a type of wet market, often sell street food as well.

Most shrimp are sold frozen and are marketed in different categories. The live food fish trade is a global system that links fishing communities with markets.

==Environmental impact==

==Sustainable fishery==
==International disputes==

The ocean covers 71% of the earth&#x27;s surface and 80% of the value of exploited marine resources are attributed to the fishing industry. The fishing industry has provoked various international disputes as wild fish capture rose to a peak about the end of the 20th century, and has since started a gradual decline. Iceland, Japan, and Portugal are the greatest consumers of seafood per capita in the world.

===Disputes in the Americas===
Chile and Peru are countries with high fish consumption, and therefore had troubles regarding their fish industries. In 1947, Chile and Peru first adopted the 200 nautical mile standard as their exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and in 1982, the UN formally adopted this term. In the 2000s, Chile and Peru suffered a serious fish crisis because of excessive fishing and lack of proper regulations, and now . From the late 1950s, offshore bottom trawlers began exploiting the deeper part, leading to a large catch increase and a strong decline in the underlying biomass. The stock collapsed to extremely low levels in the early 1990s and this is a well-known example of non-excludable, non-rivalrous public good in economics, causing free-rider problems.

Following the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery in 1992, a dispute arose between Canada and the European Union over the right to fish Greenland halibut (also known as turbot) just outside of Canada&#x27;s exclusive economic zone in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The dispute became known as the Turbot War. On 9 March 1995, in response to observations of foreign vessels fishing illegally in Canadian waters and using illegal equipment outside of Canada&#x27;s EEZ, Canadian officials boarded and seized the Spanish trawler &quot;Estai&quot; in international waters on the Grand Banks. Throughout March, the Spanish Navy deployed patrol ships to protect fishing boats in the area, and Canadian forces were authorized to open fire on any Spanish vessel showing its guns. Canada and the European Union reached a settlement on 15 April which led to significant reforms in international fishing agreements.

===Disputes in Europe===
Iceland is one of the largest consumers in the world and in 1972, a dispute occurred between UK and Iceland because of Iceland&#x27;s announcement of an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to reduce overfishing. This dispute is called the Cod Wars, direct confrontations between Icelandic patrol vessels and British warships.

Nowadays in Europe in general, countries are searching for a way to recover their fishing industries. Overfishing of EU fisheries is costing 3.2 billion euros a year and 100,000 jobs according to a report. So Europe is constantly looking for some collective actions that could be taken to prevent overfishing.

=== Disputes in Asia ===

Japan, China and Korea are some of the greatest consumers of fish, and have some disputes over Exclusive Economic Zone.
In 2011, due to a serious earthquake, the nuclear power facility in Fukushima was damaged. A huge amount of contaminated water leaked and entered the ocean. Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) admitted that around 300 tonnes of highly radioactive water had leaked from a storage tank on the site. In the Kuroshio Current, the sea near Fukushima, about 11 countries catch fish. Not only the surrounding countries such as Japan, Korea and China, but also the countries like Ukraine, Spain and Russia have boats in the Kuroshio Current. In September 2013, South Korea banned all fish imports from eight Japanese prefectures, due to the radioactive water leaks from the Fukushima nuclear plant.

The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission: NPFC was established in 2015 to manage fish stocks against increasing demand.
Members are Canada, Japan, Russia, the United States, and South Korea. China, Taiwan, and Vanuatu also participated in the meeting.
The NPFC imposes catch limits on member countries and countries participating in the conference. A crackdown on Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) vendors was also requested.

==Society and culture==
===Global goals===
International policy to attempt to address these issues is captured in Sustainable Development Goal 14 (&quot;Life below water&quot;) and its Target 14.4 on &quot;Sustainable fishing&quot;: &quot;By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics&quot;.

===Standards and labelling===
The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is an independent non-profit organization which sets a standard for sustainable fishing. Fisheries that wish to demonstrate they are well-managed and sustainable compared to the MSC&#x27;s standards are assessed by a team of experts or Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) who are independent of both the fishery and the MSC.

<text>The National Catholic Forensic League (NCFL) is a speech and debate league that was formed in 1951. It is organized into regions that correspond to Roman Catholic dioceses. Member schools include both public and parochial high schools. The NCFL recruits member schools in both the United States and Canada. As of January, 2011, there were 65 active dioceses with NCFL leagues. The IRS recognizes the NCFL as an organization eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable donations.

The NCFL sponsors the Grand National Speech and Debate Tournament held each year over Memorial Day weekend. It offers an array of events similar, but not identical, to those of the National Speech and Debate Association.

== NCFL Tournament ==
Due to the Coronavirus, the organisation was forced to not host their national tournament. This was incredibly historic as it was the first time in history the NCFL was unable to do so. After virtually hosting the tournament online in 2021, normal operation procedures followed in the time since then, as of March 2024.

== Events ==
* Dramatic Performance – A ten-minute memorized performance of a dramatic or humorous selection of literature.
* Duo Interpretation of Literature – A ten-minute memorized performance of a dialogue, story, or script by two performers, who are required to maintain off-stage focus and to not look at or touch each other.
* Oral Interpretation of Literature – A ten-minute reading event, alternating between Prose and Poetry each round.
* Extemporaneous Speaking – A seven-minute analytical / persuasive speech on a question of current events, given with only 30 minutes&#x27; prior notice.
* Oratorical Declamation – A ten-minute memorized performance of a historical speech, commencement address or former competition speech to be delivered as if it were the speaker&#x27;s own address. Limited to freshmen and sophomores.
* Original Oratory – A ten-minute memorized original speech delivered to inspire or persuade the audience.
* Lincoln-Douglas Debate – 1v1 Value debate on a topic chosen by the NCFL specifically for the Grand National Tournament. Four Minutes of preparation time is allotted to each debater per debate. The focus of the debate is on the philosophical ramifications of affirming or negating the resolution.
* Policy Debate – Two-person, switch-side, cross-examination debate, with five minutes of preparation time per team, on the national topic.
* Public Forum Debate – A team event that advocates or rejects a position posed by the resolution. The focus of the debate is a clash of ideas in a persuasive manner that can be understood by a &quot;lay&quot; judge. Side and speaking order are assigned to each team every round in order to ensure students have the opportunity to debate both sides of a topic.
* Student Congress – Mock legislative sessions where students debate bills and resolutions submitted by schools from participating dioceses.

<doc id="491124" wikidata="Q448294" url="?curid=491124" title="Andrea True">
<text>Andrea Marie Truden (July 26, 1943 – November 7, 2011), better known by her pseudonym Andrea True, was an American pornographic actress and singer from the disco era. In addition to her given name, she had multiple stage names, including Inger Kissin, Singe Low, Sandra Lips, Andrea Travis, and Catherine Warren. As a singer, she is best known for the 1976 pop-disco hit &quot;More, More, More&quot; (performed as part of her recording project the Andrea True Connection), which peaked at no. 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and no. 5 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Early life==
Andrea Marie Truden was born in Nashville, Tennessee, where she attended St. Cecilia Academy, a Catholic school for girls dedicated to the performing arts. She studied music at George Peabody College at Vanderbilt University. Her father, Frank, was an engineer, and he died when True was 16 years old. Her mother Anne owned a silverplating business and was a professional singer, specializing in polka, who recorded her own record and had performed with Frankie Yankovic&#x27;s band. Her parents were immigrants from Slovenia.

As a child, True studied classical piano and was given a high rating for her piano audition for St. Cecilia Academy in 1954. At age 15, she hosted her own television program &quot;Teen Beat&quot; for Nashville station WLAC. While a junior at St. Cecilia, True participated in Junior Achievement, serving as vice-president of a TV production enterprise. In 1960, she received an award for her work from the Radio and Television Council of Middle Tennessee.

In a recorded interview published by &quot;The Rialto Report&quot;, True stated that she married David L. Wolfe at age 19, leaving college to follow her husband for his academic career, first to Oklahoma and then eventually to New York City in the late 1960s.

==Career==
True performed in a few pornographic films in Scandinavia in the 1960s and, by the end of the decade, began appearing in American adult films. Her first prominent role was in the film &quot;Head Nurse&quot; in 1972. She also appeared as an extra in non-adult films &quot;The Way We Were&quot; and &quot;40 Carats&quot;. In 1975, she directed her first pornographic film, &quot;Once Over Nightly&quot;. Eventually, she performed in more than fifty hardcore porn films throughout the 1970s and early to mid-1980s in the early New York adult film industry.
During her heyday as a porn actress, around 1975, True was hired by a real estate business in Jamaica to appear in their commercials. While she was working there, the Jamaican government banned asset transfers in response to sanctions imposed by the U.S. after the election of Michael Manley, a supporter of Fidel Castro. In order to return to the U.S., True would have had to either forfeit her pay or spend the money before she went home. True, who by this time was trying to break into the music industry, chose to invest the money in recording a demo of &quot;More, More, More&quot;, a song she had been working on with record producer Gregg Diamond, her partner in a project called The Andrea True Connection. Remixed by recording engineer Tom Moulton, &quot;More, More, More&quot; became a favorite in nightclubs. It reached no. 4 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, no. 1 on the U.S. disco chart, and no. 1 on the national singles chart in Canada. It also peaked at no. 5 in the UK and no. 9 in Germany. A full album with the same title followed, which performed moderately in North America and spawned the second single, &quot;Party Line&quot;, a minor chart hit.

By the time of her singing career, True admitted she was burned out and tired of porn, saying, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be a waitress or a typist than make another adult film&quot;, and also, &quot;Don&#x27;t think of me as a porn star any more, think of me as a recording star. I just want to record and perform&quot;. She was performing extensively and went on to play around 300 shows within a year from June 1976. Andrea True Connection came fifth in ASCAP&#x27;s ranking of disco artists of the year.

In early 1977, True released the single &quot;N.Y., You Got Me Dancing&quot;. It became a considerable hit, reaching no. 27 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop chart and no. 4 on the disco chart. In early 1978, she had another hit with &quot;What&#x27;s Your Name, What&#x27;s Your Number&quot;, which peaked at no. 56 in the U.S. and no. 34 in the UK. Both singles were included in her second album, &quot;White Witch&quot;. It was a commercial flop and did not chart due to a lack of promotion from Buddah Records as the label was struggling financially at the time. In 1980, she released her third and final album, &quot;War Machine&quot;, promoted by the anti-war title song. A more rock and new wave-oriented album, it was released only in Europe, but it flopped.

True never returned to the adult film industry and for some time performed in clubs in Florida. After that, a growth developed on her vocal cords that required surgery, essentially ending her singing ability. She did, however, perform two sold-out shows at the Paramount Theater in New York City in 1994, and worked on new music, which eventually never materialised. True received a renewed burst of publicity in 1999 when the Canadian group Len sampled the instrumental break from &quot;More, More, More&quot; in their single &quot;Steal My Sunshine&quot;. Subsequently, True appeared on several VH1 specials including &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs&quot; in 2000 (&quot;More, More, More&quot; was the no. 45 greatest dance song), &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; and &quot;100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders&quot; (both in 2002), in which she said she wanted &quot;to be remembered as someone who brought people joy&quot; — then emphasized the words &quot;with her music&quot;. She also made an appearance in the 2005 documentary movie &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot;.

==Later years==
In her later years, she was reported as working as a counselor for people struggling with substance abuse, and as an astrologer. &quot;More, More, More&quot; remained a popular song on television and in movies, and True was eventually able to claim outstanding royalties from the track&#x27;s usage and sales. She spent her final years living in Woodstock, New York, suffering from declining health.

True died on November 7, 2011, at a hospital in Kingston, New York. She was 68 years old. The cause was given as heart failure. In line with her wishes, True&#x27;s body was cremated.

<text>Enrique Amorim (July 25, 1900 – July 28, 1960) was an Uruguayan novelist and writer, best known for his story &quot;Las quitanderas&quot; whose plot centers on rural prostitution; also known for his left-wing politics.

==Biography==
Enrique Amorim was born in Salto, Uruguay to parents who were wealthy cattle ranchers. His father was from a Portuguese background, his mother Basque. Amorim travelled extensively in Europe and Latin America, developing acquaintanceships and friendships with many of the leading literary figures of his time. He eventually had a house built in Salto, designed by Le Corbusier.

In the 1920s Amorim wrote for the Argentine leftist magazine &quot;Los Pensadores&quot; and published with the press Claridad, both associated with the left-leaning Buenos Aires-based Boedo group.
In 1947 Amorim officially joined the Communist Party of Uruguay. He was also responsible for the erection of a monument in Salto to commemorate Federico García Lorca, the poet and playwright killed by Francisco Franco&#x27;s forces in the opening weeks of the Spanish Civil War.

He is mentioned in Borges&#x27; story &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;.

<text>Phaseolus coccineus, known as runner bean, scarlet runner bean, or multiflora bean, is a plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. Another common name is butter bean, which, however, can also refer to the lima bean, a different species.

It is grown both as a food plant and an ornamental plant.

== Description ==

This species originated in the mountains of Central America. It was most likely cultivated in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala around 2000 BC. Most varieties have red flowers and multicolored seeds (though some have white flowers and white seeds) and are often grown as ornamental plants. The vine can grow to or more in length, its pods can get to , and its beans can be up to or more.

It differs from the common bean (&quot;P. vulgaris&quot;) in several respects: the cotyledons stay in the ground during germination, and the plant is a perennial vine with tuberous roots (though it is frequently treated as an annual in colder climates).

The knife-shaped pods are normally green; however, there are rare varieties bred by amateurs that have purple pods. An example of such a purple-podded runner bean is &#x27;Aeron Purple Star&#x27;.

Runner beans have also been called &quot;Oregon lima bean&quot;, and in Nahuatl &quot;ayocotl&quot; or in Spanish &quot;ayocote&quot;. Runner beans, like all beans, contain the toxic protein phytohaemagglutinin and thus should be cooked well before eating.

== Usage ==

Runner beans were grown as food plants in North America and Europe from the 1600s, and also as ornamentals for their attractive flowers. However, they came to be used primarily as a garden ornamental plant in North America, including for temporary screening. The flowers attract hummingbirds, bees and other insects. In the UK and other European countries – where the vegetable is a popular choice for kitchen gardens and allotments – the flowers came to be ignored, or treated as an attractive bonus to cultivating the plant for the beans.

The seeds of the plant can be used fresh or as dried beans. The pods are eaten whole while young and not yet fibrous, though they tend to have a rougher surface than the common bean. The starchy roots of this perennial are eaten in Mesoamerica.

The beans are used in many cuisines. It is a popular side vegetable in British cuisine. A variety named &#x27;Judión de la Granja&#x27; producing large, white, edible beans is cultivated in San Ildefonso, Spain. It is the basis of a Segovian regional dish also named &quot;Judiones de la Granja&quot;, in which the beans are mixed with pig&#x27;s ears, pig&#x27;s trotters, and chorizo, amongst other ingredients.

In Greece, cultivars of the runner bean with white blossom and white beans are known as &quot;fasolia gigantes&quot; (φασόλια γίγαντες). They are grown under protective law in the north of Greece within the regions of Kato Nevrokopi, Florina and Kastoria. The beans have an important role in Greek cuisine, appearing in many dishes (such as Gigantes plaki). In English, they are sometimes colloquially referred to as elephant beans. In Austria the coloured versions are cultivated and served as &quot;Käferbohnen&quot; (&quot;beetle-bean&quot;), a dish made of the dry beans with pumpkin seed oil. It is considered a typical dish of regional Austrian cuisine, but dried runner beans are also consumed to a small extent in Germany. In Turkey, runner beans are the main ingredient in bean Pilaki and Piyaz.

Greece and northern Africa are the sources of pods of the runner beans sold as &quot;green beans&quot; in European markets during the cold period. The pods can be identified by their big size and the rougher surface.

Cultivars include:
* &#x27;Aeron Purple Star&#x27; (not available commercially)
* &#x27;Black Runner&#x27;
* &#x27;Butler&#x27;
* &#x27;Case Knife&#x27;
* &#x27;Fasolia gigantes&#x27;, a white bean which originated in Greece.
* &#x27;Hammond&#x27;s Dwarf&#x27;
* &#x27;Japanese Runner&#x27;, sold in Canada and USA under the names of &quot;Akahana&quot; or &quot;Shinshu runner&quot;
* &#x27;Painted Lady&#x27;
* &#x27;Pickwick Dwarf&#x27;
* &#x27;Polestar&#x27;
* &#x27;Scarlet Runner&#x27;
* &#x27;White Dutch Runner&#x27;

&quot;P. coccineus&quot; subsp. &quot;darwinianus &quot; is a cultivated subspecies, commonly referred to as the &quot;botil&quot; bean in Mexico.

The related species considered most useful for interbreeding with &quot;P. coccineus&quot; to increase its genetic diversity are &quot;P. dumosus&quot; and &quot;P. vulgaris&quot;.

<doc id="491136" wikidata="Q890147" url="?curid=491136" title="Boedo">
<text>Boedo is a working-class &quot;barrio&quot; or neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The neighborhood and one of its principal streets were named after Mariano Boedo, a leading figure in the Argentine independence.

It is the home of San Lorenzo de Almagro football club.

==Esquina Homero Manzi==
 The corner of San Juan and Boedo is mentioned in the opening verse of the tango &quot;Sur&quot;, one of the best-loved songs about Buenos Aires. The corner is now known as &quot;Esquina Homero Manzi&quot; after the author of the lyrics, and is the venue for several tango festivals.

==Boedo Literary Group==
The &quot;Boedo&quot; group were a group of left-leaning Argentine and Uruguayan writers in the 1920s. Notable members of the Boedo group included Enrique Amorim, Leónidas Barletta, Elías Castelnuovo, Roberto Mariani, Nicolás Olivari, Lorenzo Stanchina, César Tiempo, and Álvaro Yunque.

Magazines associated with the Boedo group included &quot;Dínamo&quot;, &quot;Extrema Izquierda&quot; and &quot;Los Pensadores&quot;, and Antonio Zamora&#x27;s publishing house &quot;Claridad&quot;.

Olivari, who was a founder of the Boedo group, later became a member of the less political Florida group; Roberto Arlt was also associated with both groups.

==Transportation==
Boedo has access to many bus lines to the center and to the nearby &quot;Primera Junta&quot; transportation hub. It has also access to the E Line of the &quot;subte&quot; (subway).

The main streets of the neighborhood are: Boedo to the South, San Juan/Directorio to the east, and Independencia/Alberdi to the West.
==Cultural references==

The suburb is immortalized in the tango &#x27;Boedo&#x27;, written in 1928 by Julio De Caro and with lyrics by Francisco Bautista Rímoli. The lyrics personify it as a working-class suburb, a home of tango and a refuge for the poor who created it; the lyrics include a reference to the poets of the &#x27;corner&#x27;.

<doc id="491149" wikidata="Q976339" url="?curid=491149" title="Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Nicolas Rex Smith (born 24 December 1964) is a New Zealand politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the National Party from 1990 to 2021. He served as a Cabinet minister, holding various posts including Minister for Building and Housing, Minister for the Environment, Minister for Climate Change Issues, and Minister of Local Government. For a brief time between October and November 2003 he was the deputy leader of the National Party, then in opposition under Don Brash.

Smith represented the Nelson electorate from 1996 to 2020 and, before that, was the member for Tasman from 1990 to 1996. Following his defeat in the Nelson electorate in the 2020 election, he served as a list MP for less than a year before retiring from parliament on 10 June 2021 after multiple allegations of bullying were made against him. Smith was elected Mayor of Nelson in the October 2022 New Zealand local elections.

==Education and early career==
Smith was born in Rangiora, Canterbury, in 1964, the son of John Smith and Anne Smith. His father was born in New South Wales and came to New Zealand to start a contracting business, building drains and bridges. He has seven siblings; three sisters and four brothers. His father and two brothers all own independent construction crane hire businesses.

Smith was educated at Rangiora High School and was an AFS Scholar to the U.S. He studied at the University of Canterbury where he earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree with first-class honours in civil engineering, and a PhD with a thesis titled &quot;The Residual Strength of Soils and Landslide Stability&quot;.

Before entering parliament, he worked as an engineer for the Rangiora County Council, and as director of his family construction company. He also served on the Rangiora District Council, unsuccessfully standing while still at secondary school in 1983, and successfully standing again in 1986 aged 21.

==Member of Parliament==

===Fourth National Government, 1990–1999===





Nick Smith has been involved in the National Party since his university days. He stood in the 1990 election as the party&#x27;s candidate in the Tasman electorate. For the 1996 election, Tasman was abolished, and most of its territory was merged into the neighbouring Nelson electorate. Smith opted to contest Nelson and defeated Labour incumbent John Blincoe in the election. He held Nelson until the 2020 general election.

As well as the full ministerial posts mentioned below, Smith has also been an &quot;Associate&quot; Minister of the Immigration, Social Welfare and Treaty Negotiation portfolios.

====Cabinet Minister====
In 1996, after serving six years in parliament, Smith was elevated to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Conservation. With this appointment, he replaced the outgoing Minister, Denis Marshall, who had resigned as an eventual consequence of the Cave Creek disaster. In 1997 he gained the additional responsibility of Minister of Corrections. In early 1999, he dropped the Corrections portfolio and became Minister of Education. When National was defeated in the 1999 general election, Smith continued to serve as his party&#x27;s education spokesperson.

===Opposition years, 1999–2008===
====Leadership struggles====
Nick Smith was a supporter of Bill English&#x27;s bid to replace Jenny Shipley as party leader. When English was successful, Smith&#x27;s position within the party rose. When English was himself challenged by Don Brash, Smith was one of English&#x27;s strongest defenders, working very hard to win support against Brash. Eventually, however, English was defeated.

Smith was appointed to the position of deputy leader, presumably to placate members of the English camp. He took up this position on 28 October 2003. Soon, however, he was challenged from within the party based on his behaviour after his elevation, which critics described as &quot;irrational&quot; and &quot;paranoid&quot;. Smith&#x27;s defenders said that the claims were exaggerated and that Smith was merely suffering from stress and exhaustion. Smith returned to Nelson on &quot;stress leave&quot;.

When Smith returned to parliament, however, he found himself challenged for the deputy leadership by Gerry Brownlee. Smith and his supporters were angry at this, saying that Brownlee&#x27;s supporters had taken advantage of Smith&#x27;s absence to deliberately misrepresent Smith as unstable. Smith was also angry that neither Brownlee nor Brash (who appeared now to support Brownlee) had given any indication of the upcoming challenge. Smith was defeated and lost the deputy leadership on 17 November 2003.

====Contempt of Court====
In late March 2004, Smith was found guilty of contempt of court. He had been asked to assist a constituent with a Family Court case and made several public comments which broke the court&#x27;s confidentiality rules and were also found to have pressured a witness in the case. Smith&#x27;s defence was that he was exercising his responsibility as a constituency MP to aid a constituent and that his public utterances in the matter had served the public interest, but these claims were rejected by the court. The Speaker, Jonathan Hunt, held that contempt of court was insufficient to warrant expulsion from Parliament, as it did not fall within the statutory definition of a crime.

Smith considered seeking a renewed public mandate through a by-election, but no by-election was held after leaders of other parties criticised the idea. Smith stood again in the 2005 general election and kept his seat with a greatly increased majority, his personal share of the vote increasing from 46.8% to 54.9% and his overall majority from 4,232 to 10,226.

===Fifth National Government, 2009–2017===
When National and the new leader, John Key, won the 2008 general election, Smith was appointed Minister for the Environment, Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues, and Minister for the Accident Compensation Corporation, and was ranked sixth in Cabinet.

====Defamation case 2010====
In April 2010, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Smith had his legal fees for two separate defamation cases in 1999 and 2005 paid by the taxpayer. Smith stated that the legal fees for the 2005 case &quot;totalled about $270,000.&quot;

In June 2010, the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that preservatives producer Osmose New Zealand was taking a defamation case against Smith in the High Court in Auckland. Osmose New Zealand alleges that Smith&#x27;s statements made in July 2005 about the timber product, T1.2, destroyed the product&#x27;s reputation caused the company to lose more than $14 million in estimated profits.
 On 10 June 2010, Smith settled the case by issuing an apology and making an undisclosed payment. Smith was quoted by the Dominion Post as saying “No public money is involved in the settlement, although I have been very grateful to have received $209,000 of public money from the Parliamentary Service”.

====Climate change====
Smith has been the National Party&#x27;s Climate Change spokesman when in opposition and has held the post of Minister for Climate Change Issues.

In May 2005, Smith, while criticising the Labour Government&#x27;s proposed carbon tax, stated to Parliament that the National Party intended to move to a comprehensive emissions trading permit system.

In November 2005, Smith made several statements criticising the Labour Government&#x27;s proposed policy of implementing a carbon tax:
*“The madness of the Government’s new carbon tax is that New Zealanders will be the only people in the world paying it. It will drive up the costs of living and undermine the competitiveness of New Zealand business for negligible environmental gain.&quot;
*“Labour Ministers may take pride in being toasted at International Climate conferences for being so bold and brave, but there is no justification for New Zealand going out in the cold by itself on this issue.&quot;
*“New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions made up only 0.4% of the global total and on a per capita basis our emissions are half those of countries like Australia and the United States. We are the only Southern Hemisphere country with binding legal obligations under Kyoto and giants like China and India have got off scot-free.”

From January 2008, Smith was giving speeches as National&#x27;s Climate Change Spokesman. In one speech, he stated there was no question that the destabilising of the Earth&#x27;s climate, caused by increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, was the “number one environmental issue”.

After the 2008 general election, Smith was appointed Minister for Climate Change Issues. The Nelson Mail described the appointment as the logical choice given Smith&#x27;s role as the National Party&#x27;s climate change spokesman and his role in the National &#x27;Blue-Green&#x27; group.

In December 2008, Smith announced a review of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme which had only just been adopted in September via the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008.

On 24 September 2009, Smith introduced the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill for its first reading in Parliament. This bill amended the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme and it received the Royal assent on 7 December 2009.

In November 2009, Smith stated in a speech to Federated Farmers that climate change is a global tragedy of the commons. It has significant consequences and the harm will fall on future generations. Economically, in terms of trade access, and environment, New Zealand must do its fair share. As it is a complex diabolical problem with huge economic implications for societies based on fossil fuel use, climate change policies must be substantive and realistic.

In 2010, Smith was reported by The Press as saying the basic science of climate change was sound and that climate deniers who leapt on errors by the IPCC should subject their &quot;flaky&quot; research to the same level of scrutiny as the IPCC reports.

====Resignation====
Smith resigned from all his Cabinet portfolios on 21 March 2012, after admitting that he had written on Minister for Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) letterhead to the Chief Executive of the ACC on behalf of a former National Party activist. In accepting the resignation, John Key said &quot;it&#x27;s quite clear he should have made his conflict of interest also known, he shouldn&#x27;t have had anything to do with the complainant, he should have delegated that responsibility as other ministers do&quot;.

====Housing, conservation, and environment====

On 22 January 2013, Smith was returned to the Cabinet and appointed to the Offices of Minister of Conservation and Minister of Housing.

Smith was re-elected in Nelson during the 2014 general election, defeating Labour candidate Maryan Street by 7,605 votes. Following the re-election of National, he served as Minister of Building and Housing and Minister of Environment.

===Opposition, 2017–2021===
Nick Smith was re-elected in Nelson during the 2017 general election, defeating Labour candidate Rachel Boyack by 4,283 votes. He became National&#x27;s Spokesperson for Electoral Reform and State Services (including Open Government) portfolios in the Shadow Cabinet of Simon Bridges. Smith was named as the party&#x27;s new spokesperson for Crown–Māori Relations in January 2019.

In March 2018, Smith became the Father of the House in March 2018, having served continuously since the 1990 general election. Following his resignation in June 2021, Smith was succeeded as &quot;Father of the House&quot; by Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard.

Smith, in his capacity as National&#x27;s electoral reform spokesperson, criticised in March 2019 the Labour members of Parliament&#x27;s Justice Select Committee for blocking China expert and political scientist Anne-Marie Brady from testifying at a select committee hearing about interference from the Chinese Communist Party and its local proxies in the 2017 general election. Raymond Huo, the Chair of the Justice Select Committee, had declined Brady&#x27;s application on procedural grounds that she had submitted her application five months after the deadline in September 2018. Smith criticised the Labour members of the select committee for blocking Brady because it ignored Justice Minister Andrew Little&#x27;s instruction that the committee considers the issue of foreign interference. As a result, the Labour Government reversed its initial decision to exclude Brady.

On 8 May 2019, Smith was named by Speaker Mallard for misconduct in the house. No MP had been named by the Speaker since 2006, when Smith was named by Assistant Speaker Ann Hartley. Smith had also been named on two earlier occasions: in 2001 by Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole House Geoff Braybrooke, and in 2003 by Speaker Jonathan Hunt.

On 25 June 2020, Smith was escorted out of the House of Representatives by the Serjeant-at-Arms for refusing to leave when asked to by the Assistant Speaker, Adrian Rurawhe, who was enforcing the earlier ejection of Smith because he was arguing with Speaker Mallard. As he was leaving, Smith shouted, &quot;what sort of a Nazi establishment is running the place, seriously.&quot; Smith is the first person to be escorted out of the House by the Serjeant-at-Arms since the late 1980s, when Robert Muldoon was escorted out.

During the 2020 New Zealand general election, Smith lost his seat in Nelson to Labour candidate Rachel Boyack by a final margin of 4,525 votes. However, he was ranked 18th on National&#x27;s party list, which was enough for him to remain in Parliament as a list MP.

Owing to the resignation of fellow National MP David Carter at the 2020 general election, Smith became the sponsor of a private member&#x27;s bill seeking to repeal the controversial Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act 2018. Smith&#x27;s member&#x27;s bill was defeated during its second reading on 9 June 2021 when the Labour Party used its outright majority to block its passage. The second reading was deferred until 9 June 2021. The repeal bill was defeated by 65 (Labour) to 55 (National, Greens, ACT, and the Māori Party).

====Retirement from Parliament====
On 31 May 2021, Smith released a statement announcing his resignation from Parliament, to take effect on 10 June. In his statement he said that he had decided some time earlier that he would not serve the full parliamentary term, as following the loss of his electorate seat, he had found that being a list MP &quot;is just not me,&quot; and there had also been &quot;recent changes in family circumstances which require me to give greater support.&quot; Concerning the precise timing of his resignation, however, he said that &quot;Parliamentary Services have been conducting a confidential inquiry into a verbal altercation in my Wellington office last July that has not concluded&quot; and that he had been advised on 28 May that the existence of the inquiry and its details had been leaked to the media, and would be published on 1 June. He further said in his statement that &quot;It is inappropriate for employment disputes to be litigated in public. I will put on the record that I regret the incident, I apologised at the time and I apologise again today. I have decided the best course of action for the parties involved, the National Party, my family and myself is to retire now.&quot; &quot;1News&quot; reported that &quot;Smith had a complaint from a male staffer saying he was being bullied by the veteran MP,&quot; while the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; understood the altercation to be &quot;with a young staff member who had worked there for less than a year prior to the incident.&quot; On 1 June, Stuff reported that the complaint that led to the inquiry had been made by a second staffer who overheard the alleged altercation and that this staffer had made an audio recording. Smith is seeking access to this recording, which has delayed the conclusion of the inquiry. Former staffers claimed that Smith&#x27;s behaviour was well known to everyone in parliament, including all National Party leaders as far back as Jim Bolger. A former MP said that Smith had a &quot;volatile personality&quot; and was frequently &quot;outright rude to officials and staffers.&quot; &quot;Newsroom&quot; later reported that the Parliamentary Service investigation had widened its scope from the July 2020 incident to look at Smith&#x27;s treatment of his staff throughout his time in politics and that Smith believed that the resulting report would be &quot;devastating for both him and his career.&quot;

The media story containing the full details of the incident anticipated by Smith&#x27;s statement did not appear on 1 June, but the next day Richard Harman of &quot;Politik&quot; published an article alleging that National leader Judith Collins had been the one to tell Smith that the inquiry had been leaked to the media and would shortly be revealed to the public, and hence &quot;It appears either by accident or intent that Collins forced Smith’s resignation because of her claims of the imminent publication of the story.&quot; Harman reported that Collins had told her caucus in early May 2021 that a scandal involving one of them would soon break, without naming the MP in question. He further suggested that Collins was likely to have known of the incident since it occurred in July 2020, and noted that Smith&#x27;s presumptive replacement in Parliament, Harete Hipango, had told the Whanganui Chronicle that experienced political figures had briefed her that it was only a matter of time before she returned. Collins refused to confirm or deny having told Smith of the supposed leak, on the grounds that she did not discuss conversations that she had had with her MPs. She did acknowledge having learned of the alleged altercation in late 2020, and also questioned the legality of the recording of it. Newshub reported that Smith had been under the impression that its political editor Tova O&#x27;Brien was the reporter about to break the story, but that in fact, no such story existed.

Smith gave his valedictory speech on the afternoon of 10 June 2021, and his resignation from Parliament took effect at midnight that night.

In December 2021, Stuff and &quot;Newsroom&quot; obtained access to the draft version of the report on Smith&#x27;s behaviour and described its contents, with responses from Smith and the allegedly bullied staffer.

==Mayor of Nelson==
On 8 October 2022, Nick Smith was elected as Mayor of Nelson during the 2022 New Zealand local elections, succeeding the outgoing incumbent Mayor Rachel Reese. Smith defeated second highest polling candidate Matt Lawrey by a margin of 9,302 votes. During the mayoral race, Smith campaigned against the Government&#x27;s Three Waters reform programme. Following his election as Mayor, Smith stated that the Nelson City Council would focus on recovering from the August 2022 storms that damaged the city, and boosting the local economy.

In early April 2024, Smith opposed calls to ban alcohol advertising at sports games, telling AM &quot;that the economic benefits for the region outweigh the &quot;minor issue&quot; of concerns about social harm.&quot;

In early May 2024, Smith stated that he had been reassured by Crown agency Te Whatu Ora (Health New Zealand) that changes to the long-awaited rebuild of Nelson Hospital would address the shortage of beds and seismic issues at the facility.

==Political views==
In 2003 Smith voted against the &quot;Death with Dignity Bill&quot;, a bill aiming to legalise euthanasia in New Zealand.

In 2004 Smith voted against the Civil Union Act 2004 and the Relationships (Statutory References) Act. Smith also voted for the &quot;Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill&quot;, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and woman.

In 2012 Smith voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand. In his valedictory speech in 2021 he said that this vote was “an issue I got wrong,” a change of view that he credited in part to family circumstances, and he apologised &quot;to New Zealand&#x27;s LGBT+ community.&quot;

In 2018, Smith vocalised support for human and civil rights as enshrined in the Bill of Rights 1689, during a debate on the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Bill.

<doc id="491152" wikidata="Q4995044" url="?curid=491152" title="Merman">
<text>A merman (: mermen; also merlad or merboy in youth), the male counterpart of the mythical female mermaid, is a legendary creature which is human from the waist up and fish-like from the waist down, but may assume normal human shape. Sometimes mermen are described as hideous and other times as handsome.

== Antiquity ==
Perhaps the first recorded merman was the Assyrian-Babylonian sea-god Ea (called Enki by the Sumerians), linked to the figure known to the Greeks as Oannes. However, while some popular writers have equated Oannes of the Greek period to the god Ea (and to Dagon), Oannes was rather one of the &quot;apkallu&quot; servants to Ea.

The &quot;apkallu&quot; have been described as &quot;fish-men&quot; in cuneiform texts, and if Berossus is to be believed, Oannes was indeed a being possessed of a fish head and man&#x27;s head beneath, and both a fish tail and manlike legs. But Berossus was writing much later during the era of Greek rule, engaging in the &quot;construction&quot; of the past. Thus even though figurines have been unearth to corroborate this fish-man iconography, these can be regarded as representing &quot;human figures clad in fish cloaks&quot;, rather than a being with a fish head growing above the human head. And the god Ea is also seen as depicted wearing a fish cloak by modern scholars.

=== Greco-Roman mythology ===
Triton of Greek mythology was depicted as a half-man, half-fish merman in ancient Greek art. Triton was the son of the sea-god Poseidon and sea-goddess Amphitrite. Neither Poseidon nor Amphitrite were merfolk, although both were able to live underwater as easily as on land.

Tritons later became generic mermen, so that multiple numbers of them were depicted in art.

Tritons were also associated with using a conch shell in the later Hellenistic period. In the 16th century, Triton was referred to as the &quot;trumpeter of Neptune (&quot;Neptuni tubicen&quot;)&quot; in Marius Nizolius&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus&quot; (1551), and this phrase has been used in modern commentary. The Elizabethan period poet Edmund Spenser referred to Triton&#x27;s &quot;trompet&quot; as well.

Another notable merman from Greek mythology was Glaucus. He was born a human and lived his early life as a fisherman. One day, while fishing, he saw that the fish he caught would jump from the grass and into the sea. He ate some of the grass, believing it to have magical properties, and felt an overwhelming desire to be in the sea. He jumped in the ocean and refused to go back on land. The sea gods nearby heard his prayers and transformed him into a sea god. Ovid describes the transformation of Glaucus in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, describing him as a blue-green man with a fishy member where his legs had been.

== Medieval period ==
=== Marmennill ===

A merman is called &quot;marmennill&quot; in Old Norse, attested in the &quot;Ladnámabók&quot;. An early settler in Iceland () allegedly caught a merman while fishing, and the creature prophesied one thing: the man&#x27;s son will gain possession of the piece of land where the mare Skálm chooses to &quot;lie down under her load&quot;. In a subsequent fishing trip the man was drowned, survived by the boy who stayed behind.

=== Hafstrambr ===
The &quot;hafstrambr&quot; is a merman, described as a counterpart to the hideous mermaid &quot;margýgr&quot; in the &quot;Konungs skuggsjá&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s mirror&quot;, ). He is said to generally match her anthropomorphic appearance on the top half, though his lower half is said to have been never been seen. In actuality, it may have been just a sea-mammal (hooded seal, &quot;Cystophora cristata&quot;), or the phenomenon of some sea creature appearing magnified in size, caused by mid-range mirage.

Medieval Norsemen may have regarded the &quot;hafstrambr&quot; as the largest sorts of mermen, which would explain why the word for &quot;marmennill&quot; (&#x27;little mer-man&#x27;) would be given in the diminutive.

Other commentators treat the &quot;hafstrambr&quot; merely as an imaginary sea-monster.

=== Early cartography ===
A twin-tailed merman is depicted on the Bianco world map (1436). A merman and a mermaid are shown on the Behaim globe ().

== Renaissance period ==
=== Gesner&#x27;s sea-satyr ===
Konrad Gesner in his chapter on Triton in &quot;Historia animalium IV&quot; (1558) gave the name of &quot;sea-Pan&quot; or &quot;sea-satyr&quot; () to an artist&#x27;s image he obtained, which he said was that of an &quot;ichthyocentaur&quot; or &quot;sea-devil&quot;.

Gesner&#x27;s sea-devil () has been described by a modern commentator as having &quot;the lower body of a fish and the upper body of a man, the head an horns of a buck-goat or the devil, and the breasts of a woman&quot;, and lacks the horse-legs of a typical centaur. Gesner made reference to a passage where Aelian writes of satyrs that inhabit Taprobana&#x27;s seas, counted among the fishes and cete (, &quot;sea monsters&quot;).

This illustration was apparently ultimately based on a skeletal specimen and mummies. Gesner explained that such a creature was placed on exhibit in Rome on 3 November 1523. Elsewhere in Gesner&#x27;s book it is stated the &quot;sea monster (&quot;monstrum marinum&quot;)&quot; viewed on this same date was the size of a 5-year-old child. It has been remarked in connection to this by one ichthyologist that mermen created by joining the monkey&#x27;s upper body with a fish&#x27;s lower extremity have been manufactured in China for centuries; and such merchandise may have been imported into Europe by the likes of the Dutch East India Company by this time (cf. Bartholin&#x27;s siren). Mummies (Feejee mermaids) were certainly being manufactured in Japan in some quantity by the 19th century or even earlier (cf. §Hoaxes and sideshows).

The &quot;sea-satyr[e]&quot; appears in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590), and glossed by Francis J. Child as a type of &quot;ichthyocentaur&quot;, on the authority of Gesner.

== Scandinavian folklore ==
=== Marbendill ===

Icelandic folklore beliefs speak of sea-dwelling humans (humanoids) known as &quot;marbendlar&quot; (sing. &quot;&quot;), which is the later Norse, and modern Icelandic form of &quot;marmennill&quot;.

Jón lærði Guðmundsson (&#x27;the Learned&#x27;, d. 1658)&#x27;s writings concerning elves includes the merman or &quot;marbendill&quot; as a &quot;water-elf&quot;. This merman is described as seal-like from the waist down. Jón the Learned also wrote down a short tale or folktale concerning it, which has been translated under the titles &quot;The Merman&quot; and &quot;Of Marbendill&quot;.

Jón Árnasson, building on this classification, divided the water-elves into two groups: the male marbendill vs. the female known variously as , or . But in current times, is the common designation of the mermaid. This gender classification however is not in alignment with the medieval source described above, which pairs the margýgr with the (hafstrambr).

=== Havmand ===
According to Norwegian folklore dating back to the 18th century, &quot;&quot; takes the mermaid (&quot;havfrue&quot;) as wife, and the offspring or young they produce are called &quot;marmæler&quot; (sing. ).

Norwegian mermen (&quot;havmænd&quot;) were later ascribed the general characteristic that they are of &quot;a dusky hue, with a long beard, black hair, and from the waist upwards resemble a man, but downwards are like a fish.&quot;

While the &quot;marmæler&quot; does literally mean &#x27;sea-talker&#x27;, the word is thought to be a corruption of &quot;marmenill&quot;, the aforementioned Old Norse term for merman.

=== Prophesying ===
An alleged &quot;marmennill&quot; prophesying to an early Icelandic settler has already been noted (cf. §Medieval period). In the story &quot;The Merman&quot;, a captured &quot;marbendill&quot; laughs thrice, and when pressed, reveals to the peasant his insight (buried gold, wife&#x27;s infidelity, dog&#x27;s fidelity) on promise of release. The peasant finds wonderful gray milk-cows next to his property, which he presumes were the merman&#x27;s gift; the unruly cows were made obedient by bursting the strange bladder or sac on their muzzle (with the stick he carried).

=== Abductions ===
In Sweden, the superstition of the merman () abducting a human girl to become his wife has been documented (Hälsingland, early 19th century); the merman&#x27;s consort is said to be occasionally spotted sitting on a holme (small island), laundering her linen or combing her hair.

There is a Swedish ballad () entitled &quot;&quot;Hafsmannen&quot; about a merman abducting a girl; the Danish ballad &quot;Rosmer Havmand&quot;&quot; is a cognate ballad based on the same legend.

&quot;Agnete og Havmanden&quot; is another Scandinavian ballad work with this theme, but it is of late composition (late 18th century). It tells of a merman who had been mated to a human woman named Agnete; the merman unsuccessfully pleaded with her to come back to him and their children in the sea.

== English folklore ==
English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson surmises that as in Nordic (Scandinavian) countries, the original man-like water-dwellers of England probably lacked fish-like tails. A &quot;wildman&quot; caught in a fishnet, described by Ralph of Coggeshall () was entirely man-like though he liked to eat raw fish and eventually returned to the sea. Katharine Mary Briggs opined that the mermen are &quot;often uglier and rougher in the British Isles&quot;.

Mermen, which seldom frequent American folklore, are supposedly depicted as less beautiful than mermaids.

== Celtic folklore ==
The Irish fakelore story of &quot;The Soul Cages&quot; features a male merrow named Coomara, a hideous creature with green hair, teeth and skin, narrow eyes and a red nose. The tale was created by Thomas Keightley, who lifted the plot from one of the Grimms&#x27; collected tales (&quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot; No. 25, &quot;Der Wassermann und der Bauer&quot; or &quot;The Waterman and the Peasant&quot;).

In Cornish folklore into early modern times, the Bucca, described as a lonely, mournful character with the skin of a conger eel and hair of seaweed, was still placated with votive offerings of fish left on the beach by fishermen. Similarly vengeful water spirits occur in Breton and Gaelic lore, which may relate to pre-Christian gods such as Nechtan.

== China and Japan ==
In China and in Japan, there are various accounts of &quot;human-fish&quot; (, Chinese: &quot;renyu&quot;, Japanese: &quot;ningyo&quot;), and these presumably occurred in male forms also.

However, Chinese human-fish have been described (and illustrated) as resembling a catfish, and not quite so human-like (cf. merfolk#Renyu or human-fish).

Illustrated depictions of male &quot;ningyo&quot; do exist from the Edo Period (cf. Ningyo§Male ningyo). One example is the picture of hand-copied by the young lord of Hirosaki Domain. Another is the illustrated sheet of &quot;kawaraban&quot; newspaper carrying news of the , bearing the face of an old man.

=== Hairen or kaijin ===
In China and Japan there are also accounts of the &quot;sea human&quot; (, Chinese: &quot;hairen&quot;, Japanese: &quot;kaijin&quot;), some of these accounts are of European origin.

A known description of the &quot;hairen&quot; occurs in a work in Chinese called &quot;Zhifang waiji&quot; (), actually written by a European. Here Ai Rulüe (Giulio Aleni) stated that there are two kinds of &quot;hairen&quot;. The example of the first kind had a beard.

The second type of &quot;hairen&quot; described by Aleni was actually a female woman, identifiable as the captured in 1403, with drooping skin, as if she were dressed in [a &quot;pao&quot; type of robe].

Later, a Japanese source (&quot;Nagasaki bunkenroku&quot;) gave description of the &quot;kaijin&quot; encompassing features of both types: it had chin hair as well as a skin flap around the waist similar to a &quot;hakama&quot;. These trouser-like &quot;hakama&quot; was worn by men, as well as women in some cases.

An older (though perhaps lesser known) account of &quot;hairen&quot; occurs in Shaozi or Shao Yong&#x27;s work called &quot;Caomuzi&quot; (草木子), which describes the creature as having the shape of a (Buddhist) priest, though diminutive in stature. It has been equated with the &quot;umibōzu&quot; (&quot;sea-priest, sea acolyte priest&quot;) yōkai of Japan.

== Folklore elsewhere ==

In Finnish mythology, a , a type of &quot;neck&quot;, is sometimes portrayed as a magical, powerful, bearded man with the tail of a fish. He can cure illnesses, lift curses and brew potions, but he can also cause unintended harm by becoming too curious about human life.
In the Inuit folklore of Greenland and northern Canada, the Auvekoejak is a furry merman.

In an Italian folktale with medieval roots, Cola Pesce (Nicholas Fish) was a human boy until his mother cursed him to become part fish. As a merman, he occasionally assisted fishermen, but was summoned by a king who ordered him to explore the seabed and bring back items. Cola Pesce reluctantly went on the king&#x27;s errands, only to disappear.

The boto (river dolphins) of the Amazon River regions of northern Brazil, is described according to local lore as taking the form of a human or merman, also known as &quot;encantado&quot; (&quot;enchanted one&quot; in Portuguese) and with the habit of seducing human women and impregnating them.

In the folklore of the Dogon of Mali, ancestral spirits called Nommo had humanoid upper torsos, legs and feet, and a fish-like lower torso and tail.

== In heraldry ==

Mermen or &quot;tritons&quot; see uncommon use in British heraldry, where they appear with the torso, head and arms of a man upon the tail of a fish. They are typically used as supporters, and are rarely used as charges.

== Hoaxes and sideshows ==

A stuffed specimen of the merfolk was exhibited in London in 1822 was later billed &quot;Fiji mermaid&quot; by P.T. Barnum and put on display in the Barnum&#x27;s American Museum, New York, in 1842. Although billed as a &quot;mermaid&quot;, this has also been bluntly referred to as a &quot;Barnum&#x27;s merman&quot; in one piece of journalism. This specimen was an example of fake mermaids posed in &quot;The Scream&quot; style, named after Edvard Munch&#x27;s painting; mermaids in this pose were commonly made in the late 18th and early 19th century in Japan.

A similar fake &quot;mermaid&quot; at the Horniman Museum has also been relabeled by another curator as a &quot;merman&quot;, where &quot;mermen&quot; or &quot;feejee mermaids&quot; are used as generic terms for such concocted mummies. DNA testing was inconclusive as to species (and nothing on gender was disclosed), but despite being catalogued as a &quot;Japanese Monkey-fish&quot;, it was determined to contain no monkey parts, but only the teeth, scales, etc. of fish.

Another &quot;merman&quot; specimen supposedly found in Banff, Alberta, is displayed at the Indian Trading Post. Other such &quot;mermen&quot;, which may be composites of wood carvings, parts of monkeys and fish, are found in museums around the world; for example, at the Booth Museum in Brighton.

Such fake mermaids handcrafted from monkeys and fish were being made in China and the Malay Archipelago, and imported by the Dutch since the mid-16th century, according to ichthyologist E. W. Gudger. Several natural history books published around this time () carried entries on the mermaid-like monk-fish (sea monk) and the bishopfish (sea bishop), and Gudger suspected these were misinformation based on the aforementioned hoax mermaids from the East.

Gudger also noted that the mermaid-like bishopfish could well be simulated by a dried specimen of a ray. A dried ray bears a vaguely anthropomorphic shape, and can be further manipulated to enhance its desired monstrous look. Such figures made of sharks and rays eventually came to be known as Jenny Hanivers in Great Britain.

==Literature and popular culture== 
Matthew Arnold wrote a poem called &quot;The Forsaken Merman&quot; about a merman whose human wife abandoned him and their children. Mermen may feature in science fiction and fantasy literature. &quot;The Merman&#x27;s Children&quot; by American writer Poul Anderson is inspired by the ballad Agnete og Havmanden. Science fiction writer Joe Haldeman wrote two books on &quot;Attar the Merman&quot; in which genetically enhanced mermen can communicate telepathically with dolphins. Samuel R. Delany wrote the short story &quot;Driftglass&quot; in which mermen are deliberately created surgically as amphibious human beings with gills, while in J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, a race of merpeople live in a lake outside Hogwarts.

Mermen sometimes appear in modern comics, games, television shows and films. Although they were once depicted largely as being unattractive in some traditions as described in previous sections, in some modern works, mermen are portrayed as handsome, strong and brave. In the 1977–1978 television series &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot;, the merman as played by Patrick Duffy is described as a survivor from Atlantis. In the DC Comics mythology, mermen are a common fixture of the Aquaman mythos, often showing a parochialistic rivalry with humanoid water-breathers. The mermen or merfolk also appear in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. Three mermen are featured in the music video for Madonna&#x27;s 1989 song &quot;Cherish&quot;.

The Australian TV series &quot;&quot; (2013–2016), a spin-off of &quot;H2O: Just Add Water&quot;, includes a teenage boy named Zac (played by Chai Hansen) who turns into a merman. The 2006 CG-animated film &quot;&quot; features a merman character named Prince Nalu.

The monster known as the Gill-man from the film &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; could be seen as a modern adaptation of the merman myth.

<doc id="491156" wikidata="Q7829327" url="?curid=491156" title="Tournament selection">
<text>Tournament selection is a method of selecting an individual from a population of individuals in a evolutionary algorithm. Tournament selection involves running several &quot;tournaments&quot; among a few individuals (or &quot;chromosomes&quot;) chosen at random from the population. The winner of each tournament (the one with the best fitness) is selected for crossover. 
&quot;Selection pressure&quot; is then a probabilistic measure of a chromosome&#x27;s likelihood of participation in the tournament based on the participant selection pool size, is easily adjusted by changing the tournament size. The reason is that if the tournament size is larger, weak individuals have a smaller chance to be selected, because, if a weak individual is selected to be in a tournament, there is a higher probability that a stronger individual is also in that tournament.

== Pseudo Code ==
The tournament selection method may be described in pseudo code:

 choose k (the tournament size) individuals from the population at random
 choose the best individual from the tournament with probability p
 choose the second best individual with probability p*(1-p)
 choose the third best individual with probability p*((1-p)^2)
 and so on

== Variants ==
Deterministic tournament selection selects the best individual (when &quot;p&quot; = 1) in any tournament. 

A 1-way tournament (&quot;k&quot; = 1) selection is equivalent to random selection. 

There are two variants of the selection: &quot;with&quot; and &quot;without&quot; replacement. The variant without replacement guarantees that when selecting &quot;N&quot; individuals from a population of &quot;N&quot; elements, each individual participates in exactly &quot;k&quot; tournaments. 
An algorithm is proposed in. Note that depending on the number of elements selected, selection &quot;without&quot; replacement does &quot;not&quot; guarantee that no individual is selected more than once. It just guarantees that each individual has an equal chance of participating in the same number of tournaments.

== Advantages ==
In comparison with the (stochastic) fitness proportionate selection method, tournament selection is often implemented in practice due to its lack of stochastic noise.

Tournament selection has several benefits over alternative selection methods for genetic algorithms (for example, fitness proportionate selection and reward-based selection): it is efficient to code, works on parallel architectures and allows the selection pressure to be easily adjusted. Tournament selection has also been shown to be independent of the scaling of the genetic algorithm fitness function (or &#x27;objective function&#x27;) in some classifier systems.

<doc id="491160" wikidata="Q3453276" url="?curid=491160" title="Rupert Hamer">
<text>Sir Rupert James &quot;Dick&quot; Hamer, (29 July 1916 – 23 March 2004) was an Australian politician who served as the 39th premier of Victoria from 1972 to 1981, and prior to that, the 18th deputy premier of Victoria from 1971 to 1972. He held office as the leader of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party of Australia (LPA) and a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the division of Kew.

== Early years ==
Hamer was born in Melbourne to Elizabeth Anne McLuckie and Hubert Hamer, a solicitor. His three siblings all achieved success in their fields: his sister was Alison Patrick (1921–2009), an internationally known historian of the French Revolution; his brothers were David Hamer (1923–2002), a federal Liberal politician, and Alan, a Rhodes Scholar, chemist and managing director of ICI Australia.

Hamer was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and Geelong Grammar School and graduated in law from the University of Melbourne, where he was resident at Trinity College from 1936. He was a member, with his brother Alan, of the College First XVIII Australian Rules football team, and was Secretary of the Student Club. He joined the Melbourne University Regiment of the Australian Army in 1935 and served with them until 1939. He was commissioned as an officer in August 1940 in 2nd/43rd Battalion AIF and served at Tobruk, Syria, El Alamein, New Guinea and in Normandy. He was Mentioned in Dispatches in 1945 for &quot;distinguished service in the South-West Pacific&quot;. After the war he became a partner in his family&#x27;s law firm and was active in the Liberal Party. In 1944 he married April Mackintosh, with whom he had five children. He continued his military service and remained active in the Citizens Military Force joining the Victorian Scottish Regiment in 1948, of which he was Commanding Officer from 1954 to 1958.

== Parliamentary career ==
Hamer was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for East Yarra Province in 1958. He was appointed to the cabinet of the Premier, Henry Bolte, in 1962, becoming Assistant Chief Secretary. He was Minister for Local Government from 1964 to 1971.

After Deputy Premier Arthur Rylah&#x27;s retirement, Hamer was elected in a by-election for Rylah&#x27;s Legislative Assembly seat of Kew in East Melbourne. He immediately assumed Rylah&#x27;s portfolios of Deputy Premier and Chief Secretary. Although he was loyal to Bolte, he had a reputation for being much more liberal than his rough-edged conservative leader.

== Premier of Victoria ==

By the 1970s, the Liberal government was losing its appeal to younger, urban voters in Melbourne. Realizing that the Liberals had a year at most to retool their image before a statutory general election, Bolte retired in 1972 and endorsed Hamer as his successor. Despite opposition from the conservative wing of the party, Bolte&#x27;s support was enough for Hamer to prevail in the ensuing leadership ballot, and he was sworn in as premier on 23 August.

Hamer represented such a sharp change from the Bolte era that he was able to campaign in the 1973 election as a new, reformist leader, despite the fact that the Liberals had been in power for 18 years. Employing the slogan &quot;Hamer Makes It Happen&quot;, he won a landslide against the Labor opposition under Clyde Holding, increasing his party&#x27;s already large majority. He won an even larger victory in 1976, defeating Holding yet again.

Hamer, assisted by key allies such as Planning Minister Alan Hunt, Conservation Minister Bill Borthwick, Attorney-General Haddon Storey, Social Welfare Minister Vasey Houghton, Housing and Youth Sport and Recreation Minister Brian Dixon and Community Welfare Services Minister Walter Jona moved to modernise and liberalise government in Victoria. Environmental protection laws were greatly strengthened, the death penalty was abolished, Aboriginal communities were given ownership of their lands, abortion and homosexuality were decriminalised and anti-discrimination laws were introduced.

Hamer began the modernisation of Melbourne&#x27;s moribund tramway system (now the world&#x27;s biggest by route length), ordering 100 new trams immediately with further orders following, and approving the extension of the Burwood tram line from Warrigal Road to Middleborough Road. These were the first new trams and first new tram line since 1956, when Bolte stopped further expansion of the system and cancelled an order for 30 extra W7 class trams.

Restrictions on shop trading hours, and on public entertainment on Sundays, were eased. A major new centre for the performing arts, the Arts Centre Melbourne, was built in the centre of the city. These measures won the support of middle-class voters, and the Melbourne daily &quot;The Age&quot;, which had been critical of Bolte during his later years in power, strongly supported Hamer&#x27;s government.

Hamer was instrumental in the introduction of the Historic Buildings Act 1974 and made significant moves in 1977 which guaranteed the protection of several significant buildings including the Windsor Hotel and Regent Theatre in Melbourne and Shamrock Hotel in Bendigo.

By 1979, however, the gloss was wearing off the Hamer image, as Victoria was beset by increasing economic difficulties, rising unemployment, industrial unrest and a decline in Victoria&#x27;s traditional manufacturing industrial base. At the same time, the Labor Party was mounting a stronger challenge to the Liberals than it had in some time. Frank Wilkes had taken over as ALP leader from Holding in 1977, and took Labor into the 1979 election with a realistic chance of winning government for the first time since 1955. Ultimately, the Liberals suffered an 11-seat swing, losing many seats in eastern Melbourne. Their majority was reduced to only one seat, although they could also count on the support of the rural-based National Country Party.

In spite of the setback, Hamer continued in office. He promoted some new younger ministers such as Lou Lieberman (Planning), Norman Lacy (Educational Services and The Arts) and Jeff Kennett (Housing) who continued to pursue a reformist liberal agenda particularly in human services, education, environment protection, planning and the arts. It reformed the administration of the highly centralised Department of Education in Victoria into a regionalised organisation with devolution of greater control to local schools. It established a &quot;Special Assistance Program&quot; to address illiteracy and innumeracy in primary schools. It introduced a &quot;Health and Human Relations Education&quot; curriculum and compulsory &quot;Physical Education&quot; in government schools. Also, it completed the construction of the &quot;Victorian Arts Centre&quot;, established the &quot;Australian Children&#x27;s Television Foundation&quot;, established the &quot;Meat Market Craft Centre&quot;, acquired and established the &quot;Heide Museum of Modern Art&quot;, created &quot;Film Victoria&quot; and reconstituted the &quot;Victorian College of the Arts&quot;. These changes were not enough to prevent Labor from taking seven seats off the Coalition in Victoria at the 1980 federal election, over half of its nationwide 12-seat swing.

During this period the conservative wing of the Liberal Party, which had always disliked Hamer&#x27;s social liberalism, began to undermine his position. The leading conservative, Economic Development Minister Ian Smith, was sacked from Cabinet for disloyalty in March 1981. He was reinstated after pledging loyalty to Hamer, but resigned again in May. It was apparent by this stage that Hamer had lost the support of his party. He resigned in June, and was succeeded by Deputy Premier Lindsay Thompson. The following month he resigned from Parliament, and was knighted, becoming Sir Rupert Hamer. At the ensuing by-election, Prue Sibree retained his seat for the Liberals. At the election the following year the Liberals were defeated after 27 years in power.

Hamer is the last non-elected Victorian Premier to have subsequently been elected in his own right.

== Later career ==

Hamer remained active in public and community affairs after his retirement. He was chairman of the Victorian State Opera from 1982 to 1995, president of the Victorian College of the Arts from 1982 to 1996 and a patron of the Public Transport Users Association from 1989. He died of heart failure in his sleep on 23 March 2004, and his family accepted the offer of a state funeral from the Labor Premier, Steve Bracks. Hamer was praised by Victorians of all political views. The former Labor federal president, Barry Jones (and was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly between 1972 and 1977 serving alongside then Premier Hamer), called him &quot;the finest flower in the Victorian Deakinite tradition.&quot;.

Despite being a knight, Hamer was a staunch republican and a member of the Australian Republican Movement&#x27;s advisory committee.

=== Hamer Hall ===
Shortly after his death in 2004, the main concert hall of the Melbourne Arts Centre, of which Hamer had played a significant role in its development and the arts in Victoria generally, known as the Melbourne Concert Hall, was renamed the Hamer Hall.

== Family ==

In March 2024, his 31-year-old grand-niece Amelia Hamer was selected as the Liberal candidate for the Division of Kooyong in the 2025 Australian federal election.

<doc id="491164" wikidata="Q1166136" url="?curid=491164" title="Lima bean">
<text>A lima bean (&quot;Phaseolus lunatus&quot;), also commonly known as butter bean, sieva bean, double bean or Madagascar bean, is a legume grown for its edible seeds or beans.

==Origin and uses==
&quot;Phaseolus lunatus&quot; is found in Meso- and South America. Two gene pools of cultivated lima beans point to independent domestication events. The Mesoamerican lima bean is distributed in neotropical lowlands, while the other is found in the western Andes. They were discovered in Peru and may have been the first plant that was brought up under civilization by the native farmers.

The Andean domestication took place around 2000 BC and produced a large-seeded variety (lima type), while the second, taking place in Mesoamerica around 800 AD, produced a small-seeded variety (Sieva type). By around 1300, cultivation had spread north of the Rio Grande, and, in the 1500s, the plant began to be cultivated in the Old World.

The small-seeded (Sieva) type is found distributed from Mexico to Argentina, generally below above sea level, while the large-seeded wild form (lima type) is found distributed in the north of Peru, from above sea level.

The Moche culture (1–800 CE) cultivated lima beans heavily and often depicted them in their art. During the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru, lima beans were exported to the rest of the Americas and Europe, and since the boxes of such goods had their place of origin labeled &quot;Lima, Peru&quot;, the beans got named as such.
The term &quot;butter bean&quot; is widely used in North and South Carolina for a large, flat and yellow/white variety of lima bean (&quot;P. lunatus&quot; var. &quot;macrocarpus&quot;, or &quot;P. limensis&quot;). In the United States, Sieva-type beans are traditionally called butter beans, also otherwise known as the Dixie or Henderson type. In that area, lima beans and butter beans are seen as two distinct types of beans, although they are the same species. In the United Kingdom and the United States, &quot;butter beans&quot; refers to either dried beans, which can be purchased to rehydrate, or the canned variety, which are ready to use. In culinary use there, lima beans and butter beans are distinct, the former being small and green, the latter large and yellow. In areas where both are considered to be lima beans, the green variety may be labeled as &quot;baby&quot; (and less commonly &quot;junior&quot;) limas.

In Spain, it is called &quot;garrofón&quot; and constitutes one of the main ingredients of the famous Valencian &quot;paella&quot;.

In India, they are called double beans. Dried beans are soaked overnight and pressure-cooked as ingredients in curries.

== Domestication ==
The lima bean is a domesticated species of economic and cultural importance worldwide, especially in Mexico. The species has two varieties. The wild variety is &quot;silvester&quot; and the domesticated one is &quot;lunatus.&quot;

== Crop ==
In the U.S., it is a warm-season crop, grown mainly in Delaware and the mid-Atlantic region for processing and in the Midwest and California for dry beans. Baby lima beans are planted in early June and harvested about 10–12 weeks later. In western New York State, baby lima bean production increased greatly from 2011 to 2015.

==Cultivation and cultivars==
===Cultivation===

In Oaxaca, Mexico, the main rainy season lasts from June to August, and most of the above-ground parts die during the dry season. Germination or budding occurs in June or July. The first inflorescence is in October or November. The production of flowers and fruits usually ends between February and April.

===Cultivars===

Both bush and pole (vine) cultivars exist; the latter range from in height. The bush cultivars mature earlier than the pole cultivars. The pods are up to long. The mature seeds are long and oval to kidney-shaped. In most cultivars, the seeds are quite flat, but in the &quot;potato&quot; cultivars, the shape approaches spherical. White seeds are common, but black, red, orange, and variously mottled seeds are also known. The immature seeds are uniformly green. Lima beans typically yield of seed and of biomass per hectare.

The seeds of the cultivars listed below are white unless otherwise noted. Closely related or synonymous names are listed on the same line.

====Bush types====
*&#x27;Henderson&#x27; / &#x27;Thorogreen&#x27;, 65 days (heirloom)
*&#x27;Eastland&#x27;, 68 days
*&#x27;Jackson Wonder&#x27;, 68 days (heirloom, seeds brown mottled with purple)
*&#x27;Dixie Butterpea&#x27;, 75 days (heirloom, two strains are common: red speckled and white seeded)
*&#x27;Fordhook 242&#x27;, 75 days, 1945 AAS winner

====Pole types====
*&#x27;Carolina Sieva&#x27;, 75 days (heirloom, suffered a seed crop failure in the years 2011 and 2012, causing this variety to still not be widely sourced ten years later)
*&#x27;Christmas&#x27; / &#x27;Chestnut&#x27; / &#x27;Giant Speckled&#x27; / &#x27;Speckled Calico&#x27;, 78 days (heirloom, seeds white mottled with red)
*&#x27;Big 6&#x27; / &#x27;Big Mama&#x27;, 80 days
*&#x27;Willow Leaf&#x27;, 80 days (heirloom, there are white-seeded and variously mottled strains)
*&#x27;Mezcla&#x27;, 82 days
*&#x27;King of the Garden&#x27;, 85 days (heirloom)


== Pathogens/disease ==
&quot;Phytophthora phaseoli&quot; is one example of a pathogen of the lima bean. It is an oomycete plant pathogen that causes downy mildew of lima bean during cool and humid weather conditions. To combat this pathogen, developing lima bean cultivars with resistance is a relatively cost-efficient method that is also environmentally safe as compared to using pesticides.

Didymella is a foliar disease found in baby lima beans first reported in New York State. Symptoms include small necrotic tan spots with red to reddish brown irregular margins that come together to eventually cover the entire leaf. Lesions occur after around 3–4 weeks of planting and increase until there is considerable defoliation. Lesions are usually observed on the stems. Two pycnidial fungi were found on leaves, including &quot;Didymella&quot; sp. and &quot;Boeremia exigua&quot; var. &quot;exigua&quot;, which is pathogenic on baby lima bean and plays a role in the foliar disease complex. Other fungal diseases on lima beans with similar symptoms are &quot;B. exigua&quot; var. &quot;exigua&quot;, pod blight caused by &quot;Diaporthe phaseolorum,&quot; and leaf spots caused by &quot;Phyllosticta&quot; sp. and &quot;Phoma&quot; &quot;subcircinata.&quot;

== Predators/hosts ==
The two-spotted spider mites or &quot;Tetranychus&quot; &quot;urticae&quot; lay eggs on lima bean leaves. It prefers lima bean plants as a host food source over other plants such as tomato or cabbage plants.

Spider mites pose the greatest threat to lima bean plants compared to other species, such as the Common cutworm (&quot;Spodoptera litura&quot;), which is also known to feed on lima bean plants. These plants are host plants for their larvae.

One herbivore of lima bean is &quot;Spodoptera littoralis&quot;, the African cotton leafworm. An attack by this herbivore induces hydrogen peroxide in the leaves. This may also be advantageous to defend against pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, or viruses, as they can easily invade herbivore-infected leaves.

Other predatory insects include ants, wasps, flies and beetles.

== Defenses ==
Lima beans use extrafloral nectar (EFN) secretion when exposed to volatiles from other plants infested by herbivore species. Producing EFN can be an indirect defense since it supplies enemies of herbivores with an alternative food source. The predator of lima beans, spider mites, also have their own predators, the carnivorous mite &quot;Phytoseiulus persimilis&quot;. These predatory mites use EFN as an alternative food source, and thus, the production of this by the lima bean can attract &quot;P. persimilis&quot; and thus deter their herbivore hosts.

The main induced defense of the lima bean is the Jasmonic acid pathway. Jasmonic acid induces the production of extrafloral nectar flow or induces it when herbivory occurs, such as when attacked by spider mites.

One direct chemical defense involves cyanogenesis, which is the release of hydrogen cyanide when the cell senses damage. Cyanide acts as a repellent on the leaves of lima beans.

==Plant behavior==
&quot;Phaseolus lunatus&quot; has adapted to live in many different climates around the world. One of these adaptations includes a particularly effective induced herbivory defense. The lima bean is able to signal to the carnivorous natural enemy of herbivores, the carnivorous mite, mediated by HIPVs (Herbivore Induced Plant Volatiles) in an attempt to save itself from further predation.

The lima bean plant does this as an induced defense when being eaten by herbivorous predators. It is the mechanical wounding and chemical elicitors from insect oral secretions that first begin the signaling pathway to induce HIPV production. Once this pathway is induced, the plant produces HIPVs which are released into the air and can be received by any organisms that have receptors capable of receiving HIPVs, which includes: carnivores, conspecific and heterospecific herbivores, as well as neighboring plants. It is this signaling of the carnivorous natural enemy of herbivores that is of particular interest, as they become attracted to the plant and will then come and prey upon the plant&#x27;s herbivorous enemy, thereby reducing herbivory of the plant.

One particular experiment in which this was made apparent was in the understanding of the tritrophic system between the lima bean plant, two-spotted spider mite, and the carnivorous mite. Here, experimenters noticed an increase in HIPVs when the lima bean plant was preyed on by the two-spotted spider mite. Then, when the carnivorous mite was introduced, it had increased prey-searching efficacy and overall attraction to the lima bean plant, even once the two-spotted spider mite was removed, but the HIPVs remained high.

== Toxicity ==
Like many beans, raw lima beans are toxic (containing e.g. phytohaemagglutinin) if not boiled for at least 10 minutes. Canned beans can be eaten without having to be boiled first, as they are pre-cooked.

The lima bean can contain anti-nutrients like phytic acids, saponin, oxalate, tannin, and trypsin inhibitor. These inhibit the absorption of nutrients in animals and can cause damage to some organs. In addition to boiling, methods of roasting, pressure cooking, soaking, and germination can also reduce the antinutrients significantly.

== Nutrition ==
The most abundant mineral in the raw lima bean is potassium, followed by calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, and iron. When lima beans germinate, there is increased bioavailability of calcium and phosphorus. Additionally, it is a good source of vitamin B6.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===

Like many other legumes, lima beans are a good source of dietary fiber and a virtually fat-free source of high-quality protein.

Lima beans contain both soluble fiber, which helps regulate blood sugar levels and lowers cholesterol, and insoluble fiber, which aids in the prevention of constipation, digestive disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulitis.

=== Medical ===
==== Blood sugar level ====
The high fiber content in lima beans prevents blood sugar levels from rising too rapidly after eating them due to the presence of those large amounts of absorption-slowing compounds in the beans, and the high soluble fiber content. Soluble fiber absorbs water in the stomach, forming a gel that slows down the absorption of the bean&#x27;s carbohydrates. They can, therefore, help balance blood sugar levels while providing steady, slow-burning energy, which makes them a good choice for people with diabetes suffering from insulin resistance.

<doc id="491172" wikidata="Q2446491" url="?curid=491172" title="Windsor knot">
<text>The Windsor knot, sometimes referred to as a full Windsor (or misleadingly as a double Windsor) to distinguish it from the half-Windsor, is a knot used to tie a necktie. As with other common necktie knots, the Windsor knot is triangular, and the wide end of the tie drapes in front of the narrow end. The Windsor is a wider knot than most common knots, and while not truly symmetric is more balanced than the common four-in-hand knot. The Windsor&#x27;s width makes it especially suited to be used with a spread or cutaway collar.

==History and adoption==
The knot is named after the Duke of Windsor. He is sometimes credited with its invention alongside his London shirtmaker. It is however the case that the Duke achieved the wide knot that was his signature by wearing ties of thicker cloth that produced a wider knot from the conventional four-in-hand, and hence the Windsor knot was likely invented to emulate the Duke&#x27;s wide knots using ties of normal thickness.

The Windsor knot is the only tie knot that is to be used by all personnel in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (comprising the ATC and CCF(RAF)) in the UK when wearing their black tie while in uniform. It is also the only accepted knot for the SD tie of the RAAF and AAFC in Australia. However, it is often frowned upon in other Armed Services or Regiments of the British Forces through its association with the Duke, who as King Edward VIII famously abdicated in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

The Windsor and four-in-hand knots are authorized for use by all services of the Canadian Forces.

== Specification ==
In the 1999 book &quot;The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie&quot;, by Thomas Fink and Yong Mao, the Windsor knot is knot 31 and described in that book&#x27;s notation as:
* Li Co Ri Lo Ci Ro Li Co T

This notation encodes the following series of steps:
# Start with the tie draped over the neck, with the seam inward and the wide end of the tie to the right.
# Cross the wide end over the narrow end.
# Bring the wide end inward and up so that it passes under the intersection and out under the neck.
# Bring the wide end over to the right.
# Bring the wide end inward and left so that it passes under the intersection and out to the left.
# Bring the wide end up to the center.
# Bring the wide end inward and down so that it passes under the intersection and out to the right.
# Bring the wide end over to the left.
# Bring the wide end inward and up so that it passes under the intersection and out under the neck.
# Bring the wide end down and thread it between the front-most horizontal segment and the rest of the knot. Pull both ends gently to tighten.

Common variations on the Windsor include:
* Li Co Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Co T (knot 32) (the &quot;Persian Knot&quot;)
* Li Co Ri Lo Ci Lo Ri Co T (knot 33)
* Li Co Li Ro Ci Ro Li Co T (knot 35)

==In fiction==
In Ian Fleming&#x27;s novel &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, Chapter 25 is entitled &quot;A tie with a Windsor knot&quot;. James Bond, traveling on the Orient Express, is met by a supposed fellow British agent, who wears &quot;the dark blue and red zigzagged tie of the Royal Artillery, tied with a Windsor knot.[...] Bond mistrusted anyone who tied his tie with a Windsor knot. It showed too much vanity. It was often the mark of a cad.&quot;

<doc id="491179" wikidata="Q559529" url="?curid=491179" title="Francesco Guccini">
<text>Francesco Guccini (; born 14 June 1940) is an Italian singer-songwriter, actor, and writer. During the five decades of his music career he has recorded 16 studio albums and collections, and 6 live albums. He is also a writer, having published autobiographic and noir novels, and a comics writer. Guccini also worked as actor, soundtrack composer, lexicographer and dialectologist.

Guccini moved to Pàvana during World War II, then returned to Modena where he spent his teenage years and established his musical career. His debut album, &quot;Folk beat n. 1&quot;, was released in 1967, but his first success was in 1972 with the album &quot;Radici&quot;. He was harshly criticised after releasing &quot;Stanze di vita quotidiana&quot; and answered his critics with the song &quot;L&#x27;avvelenata&quot;. His studio albums production slowed down in the nineties and 2000s, but his live performances continued being successful.

His lyrics have been praised for their poetic and literary value and have been used in schools as an example of modern poetry. Guccini has gained the appreciation of critics and fans, who regard him as an iconic figure. He has received several awards for his works; an asteroid, a cactus species and a butterfly subspecies have been named after him. The main instrument in most of his songs is the acoustic guitar.

A leftist, although not a communist, Guccini dealt with political issues and more generally with the political climate of his time in some songs, such as &quot;La locomotiva&quot; or &quot;Eskimo&quot;.

==Origins==
Guccini was born in 14 June 1940 in Modena, Italy. His father from Tuscany, Ferruccio Guccini, was a postal employee, and his mother from Emilia, Ester Prandi, was a housewife. While his father served in the Italian military during World War II, Guccini lived with his grandparents in a small village in the Apennine Mountains in northern Tuscany called Pàvana, where he spent his childhood. His years spent in the somewhat archaic society of the mountains of Central Italy was to be a strong inspiration throughout his career, and it became one of the key recurring themes of his songs and books.

When World War II had ended, Guccini moved back to his family in Modena. He studied at the Istituto Magistrale Carlo Sigonio, the same school Luciano Pavarotti had attended, earning his high school diploma in 1958. Guccini spent his teenage years in Modena, as he later recounted in his second novel &quot;Vacca d&#x27;un Cane&quot; and in songs including &quot;Piccola Città&quot;, which paints a bitter portrait of the city as &quot;a strange enemy&quot;.

==Youth and musical beginnings==

Guccini&#x27;s first job was as a teacher at a boarding school in Pesaro, but he was fired after a month and a half. He then worked as a journalist at the &quot;Gazzetta di Modena&quot; for two years. In April 1960, Guccini interviewed Domenico Modugno, who had just won two consecutive Sanremo Festivals. This inspired Guccini to write &quot;L&#x27;antisociale&quot;, his first composition as a singer-songwriter. In 1958 Guccini was guitarist and vocalist in a group first called Hurricanes, then Snakers and finally Gatti. The group included Pier Farri (drums), who would later become Guccini&#x27;s producer; Victor Sogliani (saxophone), future member of Equipe 84; and Franco Fini Storchi (guitar). Guccini wrote his first songs while in the Snakers, in a style inspired by The Everly Brothers and Peppino di Capri. The group performed for two years, touring around Northern Italy and Switzerland. In 1961 the Guccini family moved to Bologna, and Francesco enrolled at the University of Bologna to study foreign languages. The next year he undertook mandatory military service, an experience he described as &quot;substantially positive&quot;. When he returned to Bologna, Guccini was asked to join the band Equipe 84, but he declined to continue his studies. He later quit university just before taking his degree (he was conferred a degree honoris causa in science education in 2002). The band Cantacronache was an important influence in Guccini&#x27;s artistic growth, as was Bob Dylan.

==Debut (1967–1969)==
Record Producer CGD commissioned Guccini to write a song for the 1967 Sanremo Festival, &quot;Una storia d&#x27;amore&quot;, to be sung by Caterina Caselli and Gigliola Cinquetti. The song, though, was not selected for the event, and Guccini was embittered by the edits made by two lyricists engaged by CGD. Guccini made his debut as a singer-songwriter in March 1967, with the album Folk beat n. 1, which received little commercial success. Three of the songs recorded for the album had previously been successes for Nomadi and Equipe 84: &quot;Noi non-ci saremo&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;antisociale&quot;, and &quot;Auschwitz&quot;, the last of which was translated and sung in English by Equipe 84, as well as by Rod MacDonald in his 1994 album &quot;Man on the Ledge&quot;. Another song from the album, &quot;In morte di S.F.&quot;, later renamed &quot;Canzone per un&#x27;amica&quot;, was recorded by Nomadi in 1968. From 1965 onward, Guccini spent 20 years teaching Italian at the off-campus Dickinson College, in Bologna.

In May 1967 Guccini made his first appearance in television, on &quot;Diamoci del tu&quot;, hosted by Caterina Caselli and Giorgio Gaber singing &quot;Auschwitz&quot;. He wrote several songs for Caselli and for Nomadi, who made his song &quot;Dio è morto&quot; become widely popular; it became one of his most famous songs, despite being censored by the RAI for blasphemy. In 1968 Francesco Guccini translated Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s hit song &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; into Italian; it was first covered in this version by the Italian beat group and later was recorded by Bobby Solo on his LP Bobby Folk in 1970. In 1968 the 45 rpm record &quot;Un altro giorno è andato/Il bello&quot; was released; Guccini re-recorded the Side A song in an acoustic version for his 1970 album &quot;L&#x27;isola non-trovata&quot;. His first concert was held the same year at the La Cittadella Cultural Centre in Assisi.

==1970s==

In 1970 Guccini released his second album, &quot;Due anni dopo&quot;, recorded in the autumn of 1969. The main themes of the album are the passage of time and the analysis of everyday life in the context of bourgeois hypocrisy, with a noticeable influence from French music and from Leopardi&#x27;s poetic style. After this album Guccini started his 10-year-long collaboration with folksinger Deborah Kooperman, who played fingerstyle guitar on it, a style mostly unknown in Italy at the time. Eleven months after &quot;Due anni dopo&quot;, the album &quot;L&#x27;isola non trovata&quot; was released. The title was a literary reference to Guido Gozzano, and the song &quot;La collina&quot; contained a reference to J. D. Salinger. Guccini&#x27;s fame began to spread beyond Bologna, partly thanks to the appearance in the TV show &quot;Speciale tre milioni&quot;, where he sang some of his songs and befriended Claudio Baglioni. In 1971 he married his long-time girlfriend Roberta Baccilieri, who was pictured on the back cover of his next album.

The turning point in Guccini&#x27;s career was in 1972 thanks to the album &quot;Radici&quot; (roots), about the perpetual search for one&#x27;s origins. This was also conveyed by the image on the front cover of the album, portraying Guccini&#x27;s grandparents and their siblings next to their old mountain home. &quot;Radici&quot; contains some of his most renowned and popular songs, such as &quot;Incontro&quot;, &quot;Piccola Città&quot;, &quot;Il vecchio e il bambino&quot;, &quot;La Canzone della bambina portoghese&quot;, &quot;Canzone dei dodici mesi&quot;, and &quot;La locomotiva&quot;, based on a real event and dealing with themes of equality, social justice and freedom, with a style similar to the anarchic music of the end of the 19th century. In the same year Guccini brought Claudio Lolli, a young singer-songwriter, to his record label, EMI Italiana. He later wrote two songs with him, &quot;Keaton&quot; and &quot;Ballando con una sconosciuta&quot;.

In 1973 Guccini released &quot;Opera buffa&quot;, a light-hearted and playful album, which showed his skills as an ironic, theatrical and cultured cabaret artist. Guccini was perplexed by the release of the disc, especially because of its arrangements and because it was recorded live (with overdubs made in a recording studio). One year later &quot;Stanze di vita quotidiana&quot; was released, with a mixed reception by fans and critics. It included six long and melancholic songs, a mirror of the crisis Guccini faced, worsened by constant disagreements with his producer Pier Farri. Guccini received harsh criticism, including a slating by the critic Riccardo Bertoncelli, who said the singer songwriter was &quot;a finished artist, who has nothing else to say&quot;. Guccini answered with the song &quot;L&#x27;avvelenata&quot;, a few years later.

Guccini had his first commercial success in 1976, with &quot;Via Paolo Fabbri 43&quot;, which was the sixth best-selling album of the year. It was named after the address of the house in Bologna where he lived. He sang with a more mature and determined voice, and the musical structure was more complex than in his earlier works. The album contained &quot;L&#x27;avvelenata&quot;, a bitter and colourful reply to the criticism he received for &quot;Stanze di vita quotidiana&quot;, which cited one of his critics, Riccardo Bertoncelli. Later Guccini was reluctant in performing the song during concerts, saying it was obsolete. 
The title track was an abstract description of Guccini&#x27;s life in Bologna, which referenced Borges and Barthes; it also mentioned the &quot;three heroines of Italian song&quot;, Alice, Marinella and Lilly, three women from songs by Italian singer-songwriters De Gregori, De André and Venditti. Other notable tracks were &quot;Canzone quasi d&#x27;Amore&quot;, characterised by existential poetry, and &quot;Il pensionato&quot;, about an old neighbour of Guccini, focusing on the sad psychological situation of some old people. Guccini&#x27;s next album, &quot;Amerigo&quot; was released in 1978. The most popular song was &quot;Eskimo&quot;, but Guccini claimed the highest point was the title track, a ballad about an emigrant uncle of his. In 1977 the weekly magazine &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; featured Guccini on the cover titled &quot;The father every teenager would have liked to have&quot;. Guccini did not endorse the article, which was based on an interview he did not know would be published, and commented: &quot;I cannot understand how they chose that title, I write songs for an audience of people in their thirties, I do not see how an audience of sixteen year olds fresh out of school could relate with the things I say.&quot; In the same year, Guccini separated from his wife Roberta (the song &quot;Eskimo&quot; is about this event), and started cohabitating with Angela. In 1978 they had a daughter, Teresa, to whom the songs &quot;Culodritto&quot; and &quot;E un giorno...&quot; are dedicated. In 1979 the live album &quot;Album concerto&quot;, recorded in a concert with Nomadi, was released. It was peculiar because the songs were performed in duet with Augusto Daolio, and because it included previously unreleased songs: &quot;Dio è morto&quot;, &quot;Noi&quot;, and &quot;Per fare un uomo&quot;.

==1980s==

The first album released by Guccini in the eighties was &quot;Metropolis&quot;, which was characterised by the description of cities with a symbolic value: Byzantium, Venice, Bologna and Milan. Their histories mingle with the distress caused by life in the city and with symbolic references. The album had richer arrangements, with saxophones, bass guitars, drums, clarinets, flutes, and zuffolo. Byzantium is described by Guccini as a fascinating yet oppressive city at the crossroads of two continents and two eras. The song is set at the time of Emperor Justinian I (483–565), and there are many historical references to that period, that have been explained by Guccini himself. The narrator, Filemazio, who some critics believe to be a fictionalized Guccini, senses the decadence of his civilization and the coming of the end. The song was praised by critic Paolo Jachia, who described it as &quot;moving and dreamlike&quot;. In 1981 Guccini was the co-author, along with Giorgio Gaber, Sandro Luporini and Gian Piero Alloisio, of the musical &quot;Gli ultimi viaggi di Gulliver&quot;. The eponymous song &quot;Gulliver&quot; was then included in Guccini&#x27;s next album, &quot;Guccini&quot;, which dealt with the same themes found in &quot;Metropolis&quot;. Songs in the album include &quot;Shomèr ma mi llailah?&quot; (&quot;Watchman, what of the night?&quot;, from ), &quot;Autogrill&quot;, about a love only dreamt of, and &quot;Inutile&quot;, which narrates a day two lovers spent in Rimini. The subsequent tour was the first in which Guccini performed with a backing band; previously, Guccini used to perform solo, or with just one or two guitarists. In 1984 the live album &quot;Fra la via Emilia e il West&quot; was released. It included live versions of many of his popular songs, recorded mainly at a concert held in Piazza Maggiore in Bologna, in which several guests performed alongside Guccini: Giorgio Gaber, Paolo Conte, I Nomadi, Roberto Vecchioni, and Equipe 84.

In 1987 the album &quot;Signora Bovary&quot; was released. Several of the songs portray people from Guccini&#x27;s life: &quot;Van Loon&quot; is his father, &quot;Culodritto&quot; is his daughter Teresa, and &quot;Signora Bovary&quot; is himself. Other songs include &quot;Keaton&quot;, written with his friend Claudio Lolli, and &quot;Scirocco&quot;, an award-winning song about an episode in the life of the poet Adriano Spatola, a friend of Guccini. In 1988 the singer-songwriter released a live album, &quot;...quasi come Dumas...&quot;, which included some of his songs from the Sixties, in a rearranged version. The title is a homage to &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;, the novel by Alexandre Dumas.

==1990s==
In 1990 Guccini released &quot;Quello che non...&quot;, which continued in the style of &quot;Signora Bovary&quot;. Songs included in the album are &quot;Quello che non&quot; and &quot;La canzone delle domande consuete&quot;, which received the Club Tenco best song of the year award. Three years later, he released &quot;Parnassius Guccinii&quot; referencing a subspecies of butterfly which was named in his honour. The song &quot;Farewell&quot;, included in the album, is a homage to Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Farewell, Angelina&quot;, featuring its instrumental introduction and citing a verse (&quot;The triangle tingles, and the trumpet plays slow&quot;). The literary critic Paolo Jachia commented: &quot;Guccini&#x27;s enormous poetic and cultural effort has been opening the best tradition of Italian poetry to Dylan-esque ballads.&quot; Other songs included in the album are &quot;Canzone per Silvia&quot;, dedicated to Silvia Baraldini, and &quot;Acque&quot;, composed for Tiziano Sclavi&#x27;s movie &quot;Nero&quot;.

It was three years until he released his next album, &quot;D&#x27;amore di morte e di altre sciocchezze&quot;, which achieved significant commercial success. Tracks included are &quot;Cirano&quot;, inspired by the play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;; &quot;Quattro stracci&quot;, about the ending of the relationship with Angela (the same woman to whom &quot;Farewell&quot; was dedicated); &quot;Stelle&quot; about the feelings of powerlessness men feel when looking at the starry night sky; &quot;Vorrei&quot;, dedicated to his new partner, Raffaella Zuccari, and &quot;I Fichi&quot;, a farcical song.

==2000s==
&quot;Stagioni&quot; was Guccini&#x27;s first album of the 2000s. The key theme is the passage of time and the different temporal cycles connected to it. Songs included are &quot;Autunno&quot;, &quot;Ho ancora la forza&quot; (with Ligabue), &quot;Don Chisciotte&quot;, in which Guccini takes the role of Don Quixote, and his guitarist that of Sancho Panza), and &quot;Addio&quot;, a song akin to &quot;L&#x27;avvelenata&quot;. The album and its tour were successful, with the unexpected presence of many young people among the audience, establishing Guccini as an iconic artist for three generations. A special limited edition vinyl version of &quot;Stagioni&quot; was also released.
In 2004 Guccini released &quot;Ritratti&quot;. Some of the songs contained in the album are imagined dialogues with historical figures, such as Odysseus, Christopher Columbus and Che Guevara. The first track of the album, &quot;Odysseus&quot;, is on the theme of travel, and contains references to the Odyssey, to Dante (Canto 26 of Inferno), and to a poem by Foscolo. Another song in the album, &quot;Piazza Alimonda&quot;, is about the death of Carlo Giuliani during the demonstrations at the G8 summit in Genoa. &quot;Ritratti&quot; received critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching the number one spot in the FIMI Albums Chart, holding it for two weeks, and remaining in the chart for eighteen weeks. In the same year, lyrics from &quot;Canzone per Piero&quot; were included in a final upper secondary school exam&quot;; Guccini claimed he was &quot;embarrassed and glad&quot; about being alongside Cicero and Raphael.
In 2005 the live double-album &quot;Anfiteatro Live&quot;, recorded in the amphitheatre in Cagliari, was released; it also included a DVD of the concert. &quot;Anfiteatro Live&quot; was a commercial success, holding the number one spot in the FIMI Chart for one month, and remaining in the chart for twenty-two weeks. In 2006 Guccini received one vote in the 2006 Italian presidential election. The same year, the triple-album &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot;, containing 47 songs, was released as a celebration of his fortieth year as a musical artist. In October Guccini&#x27;s official biography, &quot;Portavo allora un Eskimo innocente&quot; by Massimo Cotto, was published.

On 21 April 2008, an article on La Stampa affirmed that Guccini had stopped smoking, and that this had caused him to gain weight and lose his inspiration. He denied it on 18 May 2008, in TV show &quot;Che tempo che fa&quot;. In 2010 the Mondadori published &quot;Non so che viso avesse&quot;, a book which contains a Guccini autobiography and, in the second part of the book, a critical essay edited by Alberto Bertoni. Luciano Ligabue, friend and colleague of Guccini, entitled him a song, &quot;Caro il mio Francesco&quot; on his album &quot;Arrivederci, mostro!&quot;. On 28 September 2010 the collection &quot;Storia di altre storie&quot; was released, with songs selected by Guccini himself. In the same year the botanist Davide Donati named a new species of Mexican cactus, the Corynopuntia guccinii, after him. In the article about the discovery on the botanical magazine &quot;Piante Grasse&quot;, Donati explained that he discovered the unknown plant whilst listening to Guccini&#x27;s &quot;Incontro&quot;, adding, &quot;I could not have named it after anyone else.&quot; On 25 April 2011, Guccini married for the second time , with Raffaella Zuccari, who had been his partner in the last fifteen years.

==Style==

Guccini&#x27;s lyrical and poetic style has been praised by many, including famous authors and singer-songwriters. Fellow singer-songwriter Roberto Vecchioni said about Guccini: &quot;he&#x27;s not a singer of stories, he&#x27;s a singer of thoughts and a singer of doubts&quot;, while Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo called him a &quot;voice of truth&quot;.

Throughout his lengthy career, some defining characteristics stand out in his work, such as the use of different registers, the literary references to several writers, and the use of a variety of themes to reach moral conclusions. His lyrics frequently have a metaphysical tone and existential motifs, and are often centered around portrayals of people and events. Guccini&#x27;s voice is baritonal, with a noticeable rhotacism. Most of his songs, especially early in his career, are folk rock.

Guccini has been seen as a sociopolitical chronicler and some of his songs express his opinion about a political issue. In &quot;La primavera di Praga&quot;, he expressed criticism of the Sovietic occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968 , and &quot;Piccola storia ignobile&quot; supported the Italian abortion law. &quot;Canzone per Silvia&quot; was dedicated to Silvia Baraldini, and both &quot;Canzone per il Che&quot; and &quot;Stagioni&quot; were dedicated to Che Guevara. &quot;Piazza Alimonda&quot; was about the riots at the G8 summit in Genoa and &quot;La locomotiva&quot; was about the anarchic Pietro Rigosi running a locomotive at full steam towards death.

Guccini defines himself an anarchic, and he expressed his thoughts about the relation between music and politics in his song &quot;L&#x27;avvelenata&quot;; &quot;I have never said that with songs you can make revolutions, nor that you can make poetry&quot; (&quot;però non ho mai detto che a canzoni si fan rivoluzioni, si possa far poesia&quot;&quot;).&quot;

==Books==

In his career as a writer, Guccini published several novels and essays, experimenting with different genres. His first novel, &quot;Cròniche Epafàniche&quot;, was published by Feltrinelli in 1989, and was one of his most successful works. Although it is not explicitly an autobiography, it can be considered the first of three autobiographical books. It describes past events of Pàvana, the town where he spent his childhood. Guccini recounts stories he heard from elderly people living on the Tuscan Apennines; critics praised the &quot;philological accuracy&quot; of the book.

His next two novels, &quot;Vacca d&#x27;un cane&quot; and &quot;Cittanòva blues&quot; were also bestsellers, and covered different periods of his life. &quot;Vacca d&#x27;un cane&quot; depicts a teenage Guccini in Modena, as he realizes that the city&#x27;s provincialism will be an obstacle to his intellectual growth, while &quot;Cittanòva Blues&quot; the last part of his trio of autobiographical books, tells of his time in Bologna, seen as a &quot;little Paris&quot;.

Guccini also collaborated with Loriano Macchiavelli for a series of Noir books, and published a Dictionary of the dialect of Pàvana which showed his ability as dialectologist and translator.

Guccini has also worked as a comics writer. He is a lover of comics, and some of his songs reference them. He&#x27;s been author and script writer of comics, such as &quot;Vita e morte del brigante Bobini detto &quot;Gnicche&quot;&quot;, illustrated by Francesco Rubino, &quot;Lo sconosciuto&quot;, illustrated by Magnus, and &quot;Cronache dello spazio profondo&quot;, drawn by his friend Bonvi.

==Cinema==
Guccini&#x27;s first experience as actor was in the 1976 movie &quot;Fantasia, ma non troppo, per violino&quot;, directed by Gianfranco Mingozzi, in which he played Giulio Cesare Croce, a poet who narrates the history of Bologna. He then appeared in &quot;I giorni cantati&quot;, a 1979 movie directed by Paolo Pietrangeli, which featured two of Guccini&#x27;s songs in its soundtrack, &quot;Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Canzone di notte n°2&quot;; &quot;Musica per vecchi animali&quot;, a 1989 movie directed by Umberto Angelucci and Stefano Benni; &quot;Radiofreccia&quot;, the 1998 directorial debut of singer-songwriter Luciano Ligabue; &quot;Ormai è fatta&quot;, the 1999 movie directed by Enzo Monteleone. In the 2000s he acted in three movies directed by Leonardo Pieraccioni, &quot;Ti amo in tutte le lingue del mondo&quot; (2005), &quot;Una moglie bellissima&quot; (2007) and &quot;Io &amp; Marilyn&quot; (2009). Guccini wrote the soundtrack of the 1977 movie &quot;Nenè&quot;, directed by Salvatore Samperi, and his song &quot;Acque&quot; featured in the soundtrack of &quot;Nero&quot;, the 1992 movie directed by Giancarlo Soldi.

<doc id="491181" wikidata="Q5176527" url="?curid=491181" title="Council of Tours">
<text>In the medieval Roman Catholic church there were several Councils of [[Tours]], that city being an old seat of Christianity, and considered fairly centrally located in France.

==Council of Tours 461==
The Council was called by Perpetuus, Bishop of Tours, to address the worldliness and profligacy of the Gallic clergy. Athenius, Bishop of Rennes, took part in the First Council of Tours in AD 461. The last to sign the canons was Mansuetus, &quot;episcopus Brittanorum&quot; (&quot;bishop of the Britons&quot; [in Armorica]). Also in attendance were Leo, Bishop of Bourges, and Victurius of Le Mans,
and three others.

==Council of Tours 567== 
The Breton bishops declined to attend, as Bishop Eufronius claimed authority over the Breton church. Among those who did attend was Chaletricus of Chartres.

At the Second, it was decreed that the sanctuary gates were to remain open so that the faithful might at any time go before the altar for prayer (canon IV); a married bishop should treat his wife as a sister (canon XII). No priest or monk was to share his bed with someone else; and monks were not to have single or double cells, but were to have a common dormitory in which two or three were to take turns in staying awake and reading to the rest (canon XIV). If a monk married or had familiarity with a woman, he was to be excommunicated from the church until he returned penitent to the monastery enclosure and thereafter underwent a period of penance (canon XV). No woman was to be allowed to enter the monastery enclosure, and if anyone saw a woman enter and did not immediately expel her, he was to be excommunicated (canon XVI). Married priests, deacons and subdeacons should have their wives sleep together with the maidservants, while they themselves slept apart, and if anyone of them were found to be sleeping with his wife, he was to be excommunicated for a year and reduced to the lay state (canon XIX).

The council also noted that some Gallo-Roman customs of ancestor worship were still being observed. Canon XXII decreed that anyone known to be participating in these practices was barred from receiving communion and not allowed to enter a church.

The bishops of the Kingdom of Paris were particularly concerned about the Merovingian practice of seizing ecclesiastical properties in outlying areas in order to fund their internecine wars.

The Council noted that &quot;every day is a festival&quot; between Christmas Day on December 25 and Epiphany on January 6. This may be the earliest acknowledgement of what came to be known as the twelve days of Christmas, or Christmastide.

==Council of Tours 813== 
A Council of Tours in 813 decided that priests should preach sermons in &quot;rusticam romanam linguam&quot; (rustic romance language) or &quot;Theodiscam&quot; (German), a mention of Vulgar Latin understood by the people, as distinct from the classical Latin that the common people could no longer understand. This was the first official recognition of an early French language distinct from Latin.

==Council of Tours 1054== 
This council was occasioned by controversy regarding the nature of the Eucharist. It was presided over by the papal legate Hildebrand, later Pope Gregory VII. Berengar of Tours wrote a profession of faith wherein he confessed that after consecration the bread and wine were truly the body and blood of Christ.

==Council of Tours 1060== 
Those men who marry their kinswomen, or those women who keep an unchaste correspondence with their kinsman, and refuse to leave them, or to do penance, shall be excluded from the community of the faithful, and turned out of the church (canon IX).

==Council of Tours 1163==

Shortly before the council, Geoffrey of Clairvaux met Pope Alexander in Paris to request the canonization of Geoffrey&#x27;s predecessor, Bernard. The Pope deferred at the time due to the many like requests he had received. At the council, Thomas Becket requested that Anselm of Canterbury, another Archbishop of Canterbury who had had difficulties with a king, be canonized. Although Alexander authorized Becket to hold a provincial council on the matter, upon his return to England, Becket seems not to have pursued the matter. Among the decrees were those addressing simony, the sale of churches and ecclesiastical goods to laymen, and heretical sects spreading over southern France from Toulouse. Canon IV forbid any priest to accept any gratuity for administering Last Rites or presiding at a burial.

<doc id="491184" wikidata="Q102025" url="?curid=491184" title="Richard Tüngel">
<text>Richard Tüngel (1893 – 1970) was a German journalist and publisher, originally an architect and a longtime Director of Construction (Baudirektor) in Hamburg.

== Life ==
Removed from this position by the Nazis in 1933, he went to Berlin, where he lived until 1945 as a translator and writer. For example, one still finds his name on current German-language editions of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s memoirs. Immediately after the war, he was one of the co-founders of &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, initially as fiction editor (Feuilletonchef) and a bit later as editor-in-chief.

After that it is remarkably difficult to find biographical information about him, not least because he had a rather inglorious departure from &quot;Die Zeit&quot;: He had to leave, after Marion Dönhoff had provoked a scandal by enforcing a decision concerning the political line of the paper. Tüngel, who was described by his successor as editor-in-chief as &quot;...helpful and inconvenient. Brilliant and the embodiment of antagonism and artistic temperament,&quot; (Ralf Dahrendorf in his biography of Gerd Bucerius), stood politically on the right and was steering &quot;Die Zeit&quot; into a current &quot;farther right than the CDU&quot; (the German Christian Democratic Union). In 1955, the &quot;difficult, but at the same time respected and feared&quot; man (Dahrendorf&#x27;s expression, again) had to resign. The years-long arguments between Bucerius and the newspaper&#x27;s co-founders, which had started as early as 1949, ended in 1956 because Tüngel was no longer a partner.

The book &quot;Auf dem Bauche sollst du kriechen... Deutschland unter den Besatzungsmächten&quot; (&quot;Upon thy belly shalt thou go... Germany under the Occupying Powers&quot;) published in 1958, which Tüngel wrote together with journalist Hans Rudolf Berndorff, is sometimes referred to as his &quot;memoirs&quot;. The book was reissued by Matthes &amp; Seitz Berlin Verlag under the title &quot;Stunde Null. Deutschland unter den Besatzungsmächten&quot; (&quot;Zero Hour: Germany under the Occupying Powers&quot;). In this work, the two authors describe their experience of the immediate post-war years, and so one learns a bit about the founding of &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. Beyond that, one must form one&#x27;s own opinion of this man, who does not make it easy to form a simple verdict. Those that would like to see a balanced, but critical, view can take a look at the German-language &quot;Die Herren Journalisten. Die Elite der deutschen Presse nach 1945&quot; (&quot;The gentlemen journalists: the elite of the German press after 1945&quot;) by Lutz Hachmeister and Friedemann Siering, (Beck, Munich, 2002). He is of course also mentioned in the biographies of Marion Dönhoff, e.g. the one by Alice Schwarzer, and in the correspondence between Dönhoff and Gerd Bucerius, published in 2004.

<doc id="491186" wikidata="Q7641277" url="?curid=491186" title="Sunset High School (Hayward, California)">
<text>Sunset High School was a public high school in Hayward, California, United States. It opened in 1959 and was closed in 1990. The campus now contains the Hayward Adult School vocational school, and Thomas Brenkwitz Continuation high school, both part of the Hayward Unified School District.

The Sunset High School campus is just west of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) tracks, about one-half-mile north of the main Hayward BART station. There is a view of the playing fields and the back part of the campus from BART trains.

==History==
At its creation in 1959, Sunset High School was part of the Hayward Union High School District, and continued to be until 1963, when that district was dissolved and all of its high schools became part of smaller unified school districts. At that time, Sunset High School became part of the Hayward Unified School District.

On September 25, 1959, the newly chartered State College for Alameda County – now California State University, East Bay – welcomed its first 293 students to classes in temporary quarters at Sunset High School. The high school was able to share space with the college because, during the 1959–1960 school year, the high school consisted of only the 9th and 10th grades. September 1961 was the first time Sunset had all four high school classes.

In the summer of 1966, runners from the track team got together and ran a continuous relay around the clock with the goal of beating Tennyson High School&#x27;s World Record of a little over 4,000 miles completed in the summer of 1965. After 52 days, Sunset High School did set a World Record of 10,035 1/2 miles of non stop running. Each of the 24 runners ran one hour each.

In 1970, social studies students at Sunset High School researched and wrote the book &quot;A History of Hayward&quot;.

The school closed in 1990 due to declining enrollment.

<doc id="491189" wikidata="Q6288102" url="?curid=491189" title="Joseph Yam">
<text>Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, GBM, GBS, CBE, JP (任志剛; born 1948, Hong Kong) is a Hong Kong statistician, economist and civil servant. He was the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; central bank, holding the position for 16 years. In 2011 Yam was elected to a member of the board of directors of the Swiss Bank UBS AG. In 2014, following UBS AG&#x27;s restructuring, he was appointed to the board of directors of the UBS Group AG and served in the position till May 2017. He has been a member of the Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee and the Risk Committee of the UBS Group AG since 2011 and a non-official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong since 2017.

==Education==
Joseph Yam graduated from the University of Hong Kong in economics, social sciences and statistics with first class honors in 1970.

==Career==
Yam joined the Government of Hong Kong as a statistician in 1971 and became an economist in 1976. Subsequently, in 1982, Yam was appointed as Principal Assistant Secretary for Monetary Affairs.

In 1983, Yam contributed to formulating the peg between the Hong Kong dollar and US dollar. In 1985, he was appointed as Deputy Secretary for Monetary Affairs and in 1991, as a Director of the Office of the Exchange Fund. When the Office of the Exchange Fund merged with the Office of the Commissioner of Banking in 1993 to become the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Yam took the position of Chief Executive of the new body.

===Tenure as Chief Executive of HKMA===
Yam served as Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for 16 years, from its inauguration on 1 April 1993 until 30 September 2009.

In 1995, the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers voted Yam Banker of the Year.

Despite a study conducted by S. K. Tsang, a Professor of Economics in Hong Kong Baptist University, entitled &quot;A Study of the Linked Exchange Rate System and Policy Options for Hong Kong&quot; and indicating there were weaknesses of the HKD-USD exchange rate peg system during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Yam did not amend the narrow-based peg, but defended the Hong Kong dollar by pushing up interest rates. In particular, Yam pushed the overnight Interbank rates up to 280% on 23 October 1997.

In an audacious move, the HKMA also bought US$15 billion in stocks amidst the market panic in 1998. The measure restored calm, and consequently succeeded to defend the Hong Kong fixed exchange rate parity against the US dollar. The move was initially criticised by, amongst others, Alan Greenspan, who voiced concern in September 1998 that the strategy would fail and erode the credibility of the HKMA. &quot;It turned out that his timing was exquisite,&quot; Greenspan later said. &quot;It was a risky action [which]... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend as a general rule for central banks.&quot; Yam responded with an open letter, stating his disappointment and defending the decision of the HKMA.

In 2007, Yam was the highest paid central banker in the world, with an annual salary of US$1.32 million, about seven times that of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve ($191,300)., and approximately three times that of the President of the European Central Bank (EUR 351,816 in 2008), the Governor of the Bank of England (GBP 290,000 in 2008) and the Governor of the Bank of Japan ($370,000 in 2007)

In 2008, Yam was summoned by a subcommittee of Legislative Council of Hong Kong in a hearing regarding issues arising from Lehman Brothers-related Minibonds and structured financial products

====Convergence plan====
Noticing the pricing differential between shares listed on both the local market (H-shares) and the Shanghai Stock Exchange (A-shares), Yam pushed for mechanisms to promote greater convergence and arbitrage. 
Ignoring major obstacles pointed out by local brokers, he is credited with persuading the Government to take a 5.9% stake in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as leverage, and then pushing the program which allowed mainland individuals to buy Hong Kong securities directly by opening foreign-currency accounts at the Bank of China branch in northern Tianjin. 
The scheme was announced by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on 20 August 2007, but stalled at the starting gate, when Beijing refused to grant permission.

===Retirement from public service===
On 19 May 2009, Yam confirmed his plan to retire, after having served in his post for 16 years. When it was originally announced in October 2007 that he would retire on 1 October 2009, financial columnist Jake van der Kamp linked Yam&#x27;s departure with his handling of the A-share and H-share plans which destabilised Hong Kong&#x27;s economy.

Chief Executive Sir Donald Tsang of Hong Kong described Yam as a &quot;comrade in arm [sic] who acted in concert with the government in 1998 to overcome the Asian financial turmoil and under the present financial tsunami, Hong Kong&#x27;s banking system has remained stable.&quot;

===UBS Group AG===
In April 2011, Yam was elected to the board of directors of UBS AG and since 2011 he has been a member of both the Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee and the Risk Committee. From November 2014 till May 2017, he was a member of the board of directors of UBS Group AG.

=== Views and opinions ===
In July 2022, Yam said that the Hong Kong dollar peg to the US Dollar should remain, and that if the US waged a &quot;financial war&quot; against China, it would be unlikely to affect Hong Kong.

==Other positions held==

After retiring from his role as the chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in September 2009, Joseph Yam took up a number of appointments. Upon his retirement, he was appointed as the Executive Vice-President of the China Society for Finance and Banking, a society managed by the People&#x27;s Bank of China. He thus also became de facto an advisor to the People&#x27;s Bank of China.

In 2010, Yam was also appointed as an independent non-executive director to the board of Johnson Electric Holdings Limited and to the board of China Construction Bank. He was initially appointed for a two-year term till 2012 to the board of Johnson Electric Holdings Limited. This mandate was later extended and Yam currently still serves on the board. He left his post as an independent non-executive director of the China Construction Bank on 23 October 2013.

He served the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited in the position of a deputy chairman and director and as a member of the advisory council at Central Bank of United Arab Emirates.

Joseph Yam is also a member of the International Council of China Investment Corporation, and a member of the boards of UnionPay International Co., Ltd. and of the Community Chest of Hong Kong.

He is also a Distinguished Research Fellow at the Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

==Honours==
In 2001, Yam was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Business Administration by the Open University of Hong Kong (OUHK). In November 2009, Yam was awarded Doctor of Business Administration &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology. He was also appointed to the Hong Kong Institute of Education (now the Education University of Hong Kong) as an Honorary Professor affiliated to the Department of Asian and Policy Studies for a period of three years, starting from February 2015.

As well as honorary doctorate degrees and honorary professorships from local and overseas universities, Yam was also recognised for his public service career and contribution to Hong Kong. In 1995, he was appointed Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE). In 2009, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government awarded him the Grand Bauhinia Medal (GBM), the highest national award, and in 2001 the Gold Bauhinia Star (GBS). Moreover, in 1997, &quot;Euromoney&quot; named him Central Banker of the Year.

== Personal life ==
A 2023 declaration of interests showed that Yam was a member of the Hong Kong Golf Club.

<text>The Postcode Address File (PAF) is a database that contains all known &quot;delivery points&quot; and postcodes in the United Kingdom. The PAF is a collection of over 29 million Royal Mail postal addresses and 1.8 million postcodes. It is available in a variety of formats including FTP download and compact disc, and was previously available as digital audio tape. As owner of the PAF, Royal Mail is required by section 116 of the Postal Services Act 2000 to maintain the data and make it available on reasonable terms. A charge is made for lookup services or wholesale supply of PAF data. Charges are regulated by Ofcom. It includes small user residential, small user organisation and large user organisation details. There have been requests as part of the Open Data campaign for the PAF to be released by the government free of charge.

==Usage==
The &quot;delivery points&quot; held on the PAF are routing instructions used by Royal Mail staff to sort and deliver mail quickly and accurately. Elements of the address, including the post town and postcode, are occasionally subject to change, reflecting the operational structure of the postal delivery system. Each address is therefore not necessarily a geographically accurate description of where a property is located. Buildings which contain internal flats or businesses but have only one external front door will only have those internal elements recorded in PAF if the Royal Mail have direct access to them using a key or fob.

==File structure==

Royal Mail&#x27;s Programmers Guide lists the following address elements of PAF and their respective maximum field lengths:

Some versions of the PAF also contain the &quot; &#x27;Delivery Point Suffix (DPS)&#x27; &quot; used in CBC (Customer Bar Code). Alternatively the DPS can be found using Royal Mail&#x27;s &quot; &#x27;Postcode Information File (PIF)&#x27;.&quot;

==Licensing==

The PAF licence sets out what PAF can be used for. Licensing options include internal and external use and also more advanced options such as bureau services and broker groups.

An example of typical internal use is an employee of a licensed call centre who uses a PAF-based solution to look up and verify customer addresses. The PAF data is only being used within the licensed end-user and is not passed on to any other legal entity.

On the other hand, an example of external use would be a company which provides a PAF-based address look-up on their customer facing website for their own customers to use when they order goods or services.

Royal Mail provide licensing advice on their website.

==Public sector licence==

Public sector organisations can now use PAF under the public sector licence use terms. The current public sector licence was renewed in April 2023 and runs until 31 March 2028.

The 2023-2028 public sector licence covers England, Wales and Scotland, and was procured centrally by the Geospatial Commission so that usage is free at the point of use for delivery of vital public services by the UK government, devolved administrations, local authorities, emergency services, health services, and search and rescue organisations. The contract now also incorporates Royal Mail Not Yet Built and Multiple Residence data.

The original public sector licence was implemented on 1 April 2015, having been developed by Royal Mail, the Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) and the Scottish government. The public sector licence was centrally paid for by these organisations so individual public sector organisations no longer needed to return PAF licence fees to Royal Mail.

Under the original licence, eligible public sector organisations were able to use PAF within their organisation and on their website for non-commercial purposes. In addition, licensed public sector organisations were able to share data with other licensed organisations and work collaboratively on data-led projects. The original licence was available to central government, local government, emergency services, health authorities and search and rescue organisations.

==Alias data==

The &quot;alias file&quot; is a supplementary file containing additional data which are not part of official postal addresses, including details that have changed over time, or have been amended by the public and then used. This file is used to identify these elements and cross-reference with the official postal address.

The alias file holds four types of record: locality, thoroughfare, delivery point alias, and county alias:

*The locality record – old short forms, local names, and &#x27;postally-not-required&#x27; (PNR) details.
*The thoroughfare record – contains replacement street and road names for a given locality, thoroughfare or dependent thoroughfare combination.
*The delivery point alias record – holds additional information at given addresses, such as trading names and building names.
*The county record – holds traditional, administrative and postal county information.

Royal Mail, in their guide to the data products imply that the county alias information was provided when Royal Mail removed the former postal county from the main file.

==Errors==

Royal Mail acknowledges that the PAF contains errors, and publishes forms for submitting error reports. A very small number of addresses are not listed correctly, and others (especially new developments) may not be listed at all for a period of time.

==Costs and public availability==
Between 2004 and 2006 a consultation was taken about the future management of the PAF. The proposal to release it for use at low or no cost was rejected, and the business model where it was used to raise money from profitable corporations was retained.

The accounts for the PAF for 2005/6 disclosed an income of £18million, 8.6% of which was profit.

Following a government consultation, on 1 April 2010 Ordnance Survey released co-ordinate data for all Great Britain postcodes (but not their address elements) for re-use free of charge under an attribution-only licence, as part of OS OpenData.

<doc id="491194" wikidata="Q3273154" url="?curid=491194" title="Shōrin-ryū">
<text>Shōrin-ryū (少林流) is one of the major modern Okinawan martial arts and is one of the oldest styles of karate. It was named by Choshin Chibana in 1933, but the system itself is much older. The characters 少林, meaning &quot;sparse&quot; or &quot;scanty&quot; and &quot;forest&quot; respectively and pronounced &quot;shōrin&quot; in Japanese, are also used in the Chinese and Japanese words for Shaolin. &quot;Ryū&quot; means &quot;school&quot;. Shōrin-ryū combines elements of the traditional Okinawan fighting styles of Shuri-te.

==History==
Chōshin Chibana was a top student of the great master of shuri-te, Ankō Itosu. Ankō Itosu was the top student of Matsumura Sōkon, who was a renowned warrior in his time; bodyguard to three kings of Okinawa, he has been called the Miyamoto Musashi of Okinawa and was dubbed &quot;bushi&quot;, or warrior, by his king. However, while Sōkon is often referred to as the &quot;founder&quot; of Shuri-te, he did not invent all of its components. Chōshin Chibana never practiced kobudo. In 1933, Chōshin Chibana chose to name his style Shōrin-ryū in honor of its samurai roots and to differentiate it from other styles that were being modified from the original teachings of Ankō Itosu. Generally, Okinawan karate schools did not have individual names for styles like schools in Japan. Several branches of traditional Shōrin-ryū exist today in both Okinawa and the western world. While there is a more concentrated population of practitioners in its birthplace of Okinawa, Shōrin-ryū Karate has had many high &quot;dan&quot; grades outside Okinawa.

== Training ==
Shōrin-ryū is generally characterized by natural breathing, natural (narrow, high) stances, and circular, rather than direct movements. Shōrin-ryū practitioners assert that correct motion, moving quickly to evade violence with fluid movements and flexible positions are important, and that a solid structure is vital for powerful blocks and strikes. Stances that are too deep generally make body movement difficult. Another feature in this system is how the student is taught to punch. Generally, there is neither a horizontal nor vertical punch in Shōrin-ryū. Punches are slightly canted to the inside, with the largest knuckle of the forefinger (third from the tip) in vertical alignment with the second knuckle of the pinky finger. It is believed that this position is key in lining up the bones of the arm and creates a faster, more stable and powerful strike.

==Kata==
Some of the key kata in Shōrin-ryū are:p. 30

==Ranks==
In 1924, Gichin Funakoshi, a contemporary of Chibana and also a disciple of Ankō Itosu, adopted the Dan system from judo founder Kanō Jigorō using a rank scheme with a limited set of belt colors to promote Karate-Do among the Japanese. In 1960, this practice was also adopted in Okinawa. The specific order of colors varies from organization to organization.

In a Kyū/Dan system, the beginner grade is a higher-numbered kyū (e.g., 7th Kyū) and progress is toward a lower-numbered Kyū. The Dan progression continues from 1st Dan (Shodan, or &#x27;beginning dan&#x27;) to the higher dan grades. Kyū-grade karateka are referred to as &quot;color belt&quot; or mudansha (&quot;ones without dan&quot;); Dan-grade karateka are referred to as yudansha (holders of dan rank). Yudansha typically wear a black belt.

Requirements of rank differ among styles, organizations, and schools. Kyū ranks gradually stress proper stances, balance, motion and coordination. Speed, timing, focus and power are examined at higher grades. Minimum age and time in rank are factors affecting promotion. Testing consists of demonstration of technique before a panel of examiners. Black belt testing is commonly done in a manner known as shinsa, which includes a written examination as well as demonstration of kihon, kumite, kata, and bunkai (applications of technique).

<text>Trilby is a sensation novel by George du Maurier and one of the most popular novels of its time. Published serially in &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; from January to August 1894, it was published in book form on 8 September 1894 and sold 200,000 copies in the United States alone. &quot;Trilby&quot; is set in the 1850s in an idyllic bohemian Paris. Though &quot;Trilby&quot; features the stories of two English artists and a Scottish artist, one of the most memorable characters is Svengali, a rogue, masterful musician and hypnotist.

Trilby O&#x27;Ferrall, the novel&#x27;s heroine, is a half-Irish girl working in Paris as an artist&#x27;s model and laundress; all the men in the novel are in love with her. The relationship between Trilby and Svengali forms only a small, though crucial, portion of the novel, which is mainly an evocation of a &quot;milieu&quot;.

Lucy Sante wrote that the novel had a &quot;decisive influence on the stereotypical notion of bohemia&quot; and that it &quot;affected the habits of American youth, particularly young women, who derived from it the courage to call themselves artists and &#x27;bachelor girls,&#x27; to smoke cigarettes and drink Chianti.&quot;

The novel has been adapted to the stage several times; one of these featured the lead actress wearing a distinctive short-brimmed hat with a sharp snap to the back of the brim. The hat became known as the trilby and went on to become a popular men&#x27;s clothing item in the United Kingdom throughout various parts of the 20th century, subsequently gaining popularity elsewhere and seeing a resurgence in popularity in the early 1980s, when it was marketed to both men and women to capitalise on a retro fashion trend.

==Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine==
===Eight instalments===
The work was published in eight instalments, in &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; from January 1894 to August 1894. The eight separate instalments were published as an entire work in a volume that was released on 8 September 1894.
====Whistler&#x27;s lawsuit====
The extraordinary initial sales of the book almost 100,000 copies were sold in the first two months were, no doubt, greatly enhanced by the pre-publication controversy created when the eminent artist, James McNeill Whistler, initiated legal action against du Maurier and Harper Brothers, demanding that all textual and visual references to &quot;Joe Sibley&quot;, the pompous and eccentric &quot;idle apprentice&quot; (obviously based upon Whistler), be removed from the proposed book.

As a consequence of Whistler&#x27;s action, Harper Brothers removed all of the references in question from the book prior to its publication and, also, removed them from its reprints of the March 1894 issue. On 2 December 1894, the &quot;Chicago Sunday Tribune&quot; gave details of Whistler&#x27;s protests, and published a side-by-side comparison of the original text and illustrations and those of the altered published volume.

==Plot summary==
Three English art students in Paris (Talbot Wynne, called &#x27;Taffy&#x27;, a distant heir to a baronetcy; Sandy McAlister, the Laird of Cockpen and William Bagot, alias &#x27;Little Billee&#x27;) meet musicians Svengali and Gecko and the artist&#x27;s model and laundress Trilby O&#x27;Ferrall. Trilby is cheerful, kind-hearted, bohemian, and tone-deaf: &quot;Svengali would test her ear, as he called it, and strike the C in the middle and then the F just above, and ask which was higher; and she would declare they were both the same&quot;. To the bemusement of the other characters, Trilby is unable to sing &quot;Ben Bolt&quot; in tune. Yet despite being off-key, her singing voice nonetheless has an impressive quality.

The Englishmen and Trilby become friends. Svengali tries to persuade Trilby to let him train her voice but she finds him repulsive and even frightening. She and Little Billee fall in love but his scandalized relatives get her to promise to leave him. She leaves Paris with her little brother, who later dies of scarlet fever. Trilby then falls under Svengali&#x27;s influence. He hypnotises her and transforms her into a diva, La Svengali. Under his spell, Trilby becomes a talented singer, performing always in an amnesiac trance. Five years later, Little Billee is a famous painter. He, the Laird and Taffy recognise Trilby as she performs at a concert. Trilby sings beautifully but does not appear to be in good health.

Shortly before another performance, Gecko suddenly turns on Svengali and slashes him with a penknife. At the concert, Svengali is stricken by a heart attack and is unable to induce the trance. Trilby is unable to sing in tune and is subjected to &quot;laughter, hoots, hisses, cat-calls, cock-crows&quot;. Not having been hypnotised, she is baffled and, though she can remember living and travelling with Svengali, cannot remember anything of her singing career. Suddenly an audience member yells:

&quot;Oh, ye&#x27;re Henglish, har yer? Why don&#x27;t yer sing as yer &quot;ought&quot; to sing—yer&#x27;ve got &quot;voice&quot; enough, any&#x27;ow! Why don&#x27;t yer sing in &quot;tune?&quot;&quot; she cries &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to sing at all—I only sang because I was asked to sing—that gentleman asked—that French gentleman with the white waistcoat! I won&#x27;t sing another note!&quot;

As she leaves the stage, Svengali dies. Trilby is stricken with a nervous affliction. Despite the efforts of her friends, she dies some weeks later—staring at a picture of Svengali. Little Billee is devastated and dies shortly afterwards. Some years later, Taffy, who has married Little Billee&#x27;s sister, meets Gecko again and learns how Svengali had hypnotised Trilby and damaged her health in the process. Gecko reveals that he had tried to kill Svengali because he could not bear to see Trilby hurt during their awful rehearsals.

==Inspiration==

It was popularly believed that the hypnotic control Svengali has over Trilby was modelled after the relationship between the French harpist and composer Nicolas-Charles Bochsa and the English operatic soprano Anna Bishop. Anna Bishop had left her husband Henry Bishop (later Sir Henry), the composer of &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot;, for Bochsa. Bishop was 23 years her senior and Bochsa was 20 years older than Anna. Bochsa became her manager as well as her lover. She sang in many opera houses on their extensive travels throughout Europe (particularly in Naples, Italy), North America and Sydney, where Bochsa died suddenly in 1856 and is buried. Sir Henry Bishop had died the previous year. Anna Bishop later remarried, continued travelling and singing professionally into her seventies, and died in New York City. The character of Little Billee is a reference to an eponymous ballad by William Makepeace Thackeray.

==Reception==
The late nineteenth-century novelist George Gissing read the &quot;notorious&quot; novel in May 1896 with &quot;scant satisfaction&quot;. &quot;Trilby&quot; inspired Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1910) in part. It was also known for introducing the phrase &quot;Svengali&quot;, a term referring to a man with dominating powers over a (generally female) protégée.

=== Trilby-Mania ===

&quot;Trilby&quot; was one of the most popular books of the Victorian era. As a result, the novel had large influence on Victorian popular culture, creating a craze that was referred to as &quot;Trilby-Mania&quot; or the &quot;Trilbyana&quot;. The book&#x27;s popularity caused footwear inspired by the titular character to grow in popularity, and footreading became a fad. Additionally, foot-shaped ice cream became popular due to the book. The word &quot;trilby&quot; became a jocular slang term to refer to a foot, but would later be used to describe a type of hat inspired by an adaptation of the novel.

== Criticism ==
&quot;Trilby&quot; has been criticized for its depiction of its Jewish antagonist, Svengali. Most notably, George Orwell wrote that the novel is overtly antisemitic. Orwell believed that du Maurier attributes all of Svengali&#x27;s villainous and rapacious qualities to his Jewishness.

==Adaptations and references to the novel==
The novel was adapted into a long-running play, &quot;Trilby&quot;, starring Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Svengali, first presented in 1895 in London. In New York Wilton Lackaye originated the role of Svengali and Virginia Harned played the title role. The play was revived many times, including at the Apollo Theatre in the 1920s. The play was so popular that it was travestied, including as &quot;A Model Trilby; or, A Day or Two After Du Maurier&quot; by Charles H. E. Brookfield and William Yardley, with music by Meyer Lutz, at the Opera Comique, produced by the retired Nellie Farren.

The novel has also been adapted to film numerous times:
* &quot;Trilby&quot;, (1912) an Austrian silent film starring Paul Askonas and Elsa Galafrés, directed by Anton Kolm, Luise Kolm, Jacob Fleck, and Claudius Veltée.
* &quot;Trilby&quot; (1914), a British silent film starring Viva Birkett and Herbert Beerbohm Tree, directed by Harold M. Shaw
* &quot;Trilby&quot; (1915), an American silent film starring Clara Kimball Young and Wilton Lackaye, directed by Maurice Tourneur
* &quot;Trilby&quot; (1923), an American silent film starring Andree Lafayette, Arthur Edmund Carewe, and Creighton Hale
* &quot;Svengali&quot; (1927), a German silent film starring Paul Wegener and Anita Dorris
* &quot;Svengali&quot; (1931), a Warner Brothers release with John Barrymore and Marian Marsh
* &quot;Svengali&quot; (1954), a British film starring Donald Wolfit and Hildegard Knef
* &quot;Svengali&quot; (1983), a TV movie starring Peter O&#x27;Toole and Jodie Foster

A musical adaptation by Frank Wildhorn, entitled &quot;Svengali&quot;, was staged twice in 1991.

The Trilby story was parodied in &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; cartoons in the 1940s that featured Pearl Pureheart and Oil Can Harry. Included was a performance of &quot;Ben Bolt&quot;.

A fandom developed around the Trilby character, called Trilbyana, which was criticised in &quot;Belsham&#x27;s Essays&quot;. Trilby is referenced several times in William Gaddis&#x27; novel &quot;JR&quot;, wherein Edward Bast the protagonist becomes a mirror of Little Billee, a prominent artist in Trilby.

An inside look at &quot;Trilby&quot; and Henry James&#x27;s friendship with du Maurier (Kiki) can be found in David Lodge&#x27;s novel &quot;Author, Author&quot; (2004).

Australian composer Thomas Bulch writing under the pen name &quot;Charles Le Thierre&quot; published a &quot;Trilby&quot; waltz dedication, featuring Trilby posing for an artist on the cover in the same year as Sydney productions of the stage play.

The celebrated Polish World War II Special Operations Executive agent Krystyna Skarbek, a.k.a. Christine Granville, used Svengali as a metaphor when saying of her second husband, Jerzy Giżycki, &quot;He was my Svengali for so many years that he would never believe that I could ever leave him for good&quot;.

In 2011 and 2012, the British illusionist Derren Brown performed a stage show called &quot;Svengali&quot; in which he makes reference to the character throughout the show.

<text>Ashburton () is a large town in the Canterbury Region, on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The town is the seat of the Ashburton District. It is south west of Christchurch and is sometimes regarded as a satellite town of Christchurch.

The town has a population of . It is the 29th-largest urban area in New Zealand and the fourth-largest urban area in the Canterbury Region, after Christchurch, Timaru and Rolleston.
==Toponymy==
Ashburton was named by the surveyor Captain Joseph Thomas of the New Zealand Land Association, after Francis Baring, 3rd Baron Ashburton, who was a member of the Canterbury Association. Ashburton is sometimes nicknamed &quot;Ashvegas&quot;, an ironic allusion to Las Vegas.

Hakatere is the traditional Māori name for the Ashburton River. The name translates as &quot;to make swift or to flow smoothly&quot;.

==History==
In 1858 William Turton, ran a ferry across the Ashburton river close to where the Ashburton bridge now lies. He also built an accommodation house which along with some stables were the only buildings in Ashburton in 1863.

By 1864 the horse-drawn coaches of the Cobb and Co. business travelled through Ashburton between Christchurch and Timaru. This continued until the railway line was built.

The town was surveyed by Robert Park in 1864. It is laid out around two central squares either side of the railway line and main highway, Baring Square East and Baring Square West. The Ashburton Domain was included in the plans for the purposes of gardens and recreation. The 100 acres of land that was identified for the Domain was a &quot;miserable wildness&quot; of spear grass, broom, and tussock.

The Canterbury provincial government granted 20,000 pounds to develop roads in the district in 1873 and in 1874 the railway reached Ashburton.

The Presbyterian church was completed in 1876, The Wesleyan church in 1878 and the Catholic church in 1882.

Ashburton was designated as a borough in 1878. At this stage, there were about 500 buildings within the borough. A cricket pitch was established in the Ashburton Domain in 1878 and the Ashburton Hospital was established in 1879.

Electricity first arrived in Ashburton in 1908. This was supplied by a 30 kilowatt generator powered by a steam traction engine. In 1921 the Ashburton Electric Power Board was established and by 1927 it had 2804 customers.

Netherby was added to the borough of Ashburton in 1917, Hampstead in 1921, and Allenton in 1939 to the borough of Ashburton. In 1955, Tinwald was added to the borough.

Ashburton was used as a training base for the Royal New Zealand Air Force during World War 2 with 50 tiger moth aircraft based there.

On 1 September 2014, there was a violent incident in Ashburton that received nationwide publicity. A man who had previously been trespassed from the Ashburton Work and Income office arrived at the premises with a shotgun and murdered two front counter workers. At the subsequent trial, the offender was given the third longest sentence on record. In the aftermath of the attack, the security at WINZ offices was reviewed nationwide. In December 2016, the Ministry for Social Development was convicted of breaching workplace safety legislation in relation to the incident.

In 2021, the Ashburton slogan: &quot;Whatever it takes&quot; was scrapped by the Ashburton District Council. Having been in use for approximately 10 years, it has drawn criticism. In 2012, it made a list of Top 10 worst NZ city slogans. The Ashburton welcome sign had been changed surreptitiously at times from ‘Ashburton: Whatever it Takes’ to ‘Ashburton: ‘Whatever’.

In April 2021, a contract was signed to start a $42 million build of a new library and civic centre for Ashburton. A $20 million contribution came from the New Zealand government. The three-story building will include council chambers, office space, a recording studio, areas to study in, a library and a performance area. It will also incorporate the Pioneer Hall into the facility. The library is to be named Te Pātaka o kā Tuhituhi and the civic centre is to be named Te Waharoa a Hine Paaka.

A new retail centre called &quot;River Crossing&quot; is planned to open in 2022. Local property developers hope that this will mean the local people will have more opportunities to spend their money in Ashburton rather than Christchurch or Timaru. A March 2020 report found that 32% of retail spending by locals, was spent out of town. Between 150 and 180 jobs are expected to be created as a result of the development.

==Geography==
===Setting===
Ashburton is situated 17 kilometres inland on the Canterbury Plains approximately south of Christchurch and 75 kilometres north of Timaru. Methven is 33kilometres inland from Ashburton. Rakaia and the Rakaia river are 28kilometres to the north of Ashburton.

The town is the centre of an agricultural and pastoral farming district on the Canterbury Plains. It has one large suburb, Tinwald, south of the Ashburton River / Hakatere. The town has three other suburbs: Allenton, Hampstead and Netherby.

=== Climate ===
On the whole, Ashburton shares a similar climate to Christchurch i.e. a dry temperate climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). However, since it lies further inland at a higher altitude to Christchurch, Ashburton experiences a greater range of temperatures. Summers in Ashburton can be warm, seeing an average of 39 days exceeding and 7 days exceeding every year, while winters are frosty, with temperatures dropping below an average of 51 nights a year. Ashburton occasionally sees snowfall, with its heaviest being on 12 June 2006, conversely it is tied with Timaru for New Zealand&#x27;s fourth-highest temperature on record, reaching on 7 February 1973.

=== Rivers and lakes ===

The Ashburton River / Hakatere flows across Mid Canterbury from the Southern Alps to the Pacific Ocean. The official name of the river was amended to become a dual name by the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. The river passes through the town of Ashburton, separating the south-east suburb of Tinwald from the rest of the town.

The nearest beach to Ashburton is Wakanui beach, but is not safe for swimming due to a strong undertow. In part to rectify the limitations imposed by the lack of recreational waterways, Lake Hood was constructed just south-east of Tinwald. The Ashburton lakes Lake Heron, Lake Camp and Lake Clearwater are inland. On the road to these lakes are Mount Somers and the Mount Somers walkway.

=== Vegetable processing ===
A vegetable processing factory owned by Talley&#x27;s is located on the northern outskirts of Ashburton. The factory was built in 1996 to take advantage of the good soils and irrigation of the Ashburton district. The factory processes peas, corn and potatoes.

Several of the 40-plus companies are national companies based outside the district, such as Fonterra, Foodstuffs and Silver Fern Farms (meat processing), but many were local cooperatives, such as the Ashburton Trading Society (farm supplies) and Electricity Ashburton (electricity distribution).

==Culture==
=== Museum and Art Gallery ===
The Ashburton Museum and Art Gallery share one building, which sits on State Highway 1, just outside the centre of town. As well as temporary exhibitions, the museum has a permanent exhibition tracing the history of the Ashburton district.

=== Marae ===
The Hakatere marae is located on the northern edge of Ashburton. Although Ashburton is within the rohe or region where the Ngāi Tahu iwi are traditionally based, the Hakatere marae is not a Ngāi Tahu marae. It was built as a marae for people from all iwi. The marae is located on land that was originally the Fairton Primary School. This land was acquired in 1970 and the Hakatere marae was gazetted as a Māori reserve in 1976. The wharenui was destroyed by an arson attack in 2003. The wharekai was completed in 2007 at a cost of around $300,000.

It is run by Canterbury District Health Board and the rural health service employed approximately 550 staff in 2021.
=== Rail ===
The Main South Line railway line runs through the centre of town. The station opened on 24 August 1874 and the refreshment room was converted from table- to counter-service to save staff and increase the speed of service in 1944. The rooms closed in 1970, when the Southerner service was established. The service ceased on 10 February 2002, but the station is still used for freight, as some barley continues to be sent by train to maltings at Marton. The station&#x27;s container terminal is in use on weekdays. The station building was demolished in 2013 after several resource consent hearings.
The stations footbridge still remains, and is used for crossing the rail corridor.

Tinwald was the junction for the now-closed Mount Somers Branch railway line. The station opened as Ashburton South on 31 May 1875. It was renamed Tinwald from 18 March 1878, and closed on 11 October 1981 to all but private siding traffic. Part of the branch still operates as the Plains Vintage Railway.

Funding from the New Zealand government and the Ashburton District Council for a new rail freight hub was provided in October 2021. The project will move the rail container terminal from the centre of Ashburton to Fairton. The project is expected to be complete by the end of 2022, and has an estimated cost of $14M. It should help ease congestion on the roads in the centre of Ashburton.

=== Road ===
State Highway 1 runs through the centre of Ashburton and provides the main road connection between Christchurch and Dunedin. The highway crosses the Ashburton river via a bridge that is the only direct route across the river for local traffic and State Highway 1 traffic.

====SH1 Ashburton river bridge====
The bridge on State Highway 1 crossing the Ashburton river was opened in 1931, and was the first wide bridge in New Zealand. On 1 June 2021, a severe flood in the Ashburton river caused scouring damage to piers supporting the bridge, and the bridge deck subsided, leading to a temporary closure. At the time of closure, there were no other routes for SH1 traffic wanting to go north or south across the Ashburton river, because all inland routes were also closed. On 3 June 2021, the bridge was re-opened for heavy traffic during daylight hours only, and all restrictions were lifted on 10 June.

The Ashburton District Council has been trying to obtain funding from Waka Kotahi (New Zealand Transport Agency) for a second bridge for local traffic and to provide more resilience to the road network. In 2021, the additional bridge was planned to be built in 15 years time.

====Other routes====
State Highway 77 starts in Ashburton and heads towards Methven, and then through the Rakaia gorge and on to Darfield.

=== Air ===
The Ashburton Airport is located near the town centre and is an active light (GA and Microlight) aviation hub and home of the Mid Canterbury Aero Club (GA) and Ashburton Aviation Pioneers.

In October 2021, the future of how the airport was being operated was being debated as managing the challenge of increasing aviation activity with the desire to develop the land around the airport could cause conflict due to the potential of noise pollution from the airport.

<text>Electrowetting is the modification of the wetting properties of a surface (which is typically hydrophobic) with an applied electric field.

==History==
The electrowetting of mercury and other liquids on variably charged surfaces was probably first explained by Gabriel Lippmann in 1875 and was certainly observed much earlier. A. N. Frumkin used surface charge to change the shape of water drops in 1936. The term electrowetting was first introduced in 1981 by G. Beni and S. Hackwood to describe an effect proposed for designing a new type of display device for which they received a patent. The use of a &quot;fluid transistor&quot; in microfluidic circuits for manipulating chemical and biological fluids was first investigated by J. Brown in 1980 and later funded in 1984–1988 under NSF Grants 8760730 &amp; 8822197, employing insulating dielectric and hydrophobic layer(s) (EWOD), immiscible fluids, DC or RF power; and mass arrays of miniature interleaved (saw tooth) electrodes with large or matching indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to digitally relocate nano droplets in linear, circular, and directed paths, pump or mix fluids, fill reservoirs, and control fluid flow electronically or optically. Later, in collaboration with J. Silver at the NIH, EWOD-based electrowetting was disclosed for single and immiscible fluids to move, separate, hold, and seal arrays of digital PCR sub-samples.

Electrowetting using an insulating layer on top of a bare electrode was later studied by Bruno Berge in 1993. Electrowetting on this dielectric-coated surface is called electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) to distinguish it from the conventional electrowetting on the bare electrode. Electrowetting can be demonstrated by replacing the metal electrode in the EWOD system by a semiconductor. Electrowetting is also observed when a reverse bias is applied to a conducting droplet (e.g. mercury) which has been placed directly onto a semiconductor surface (e.g. silicon) to form a Schottky contact in a Schottky diode electrical circuit configuration – this effect has been termed ‘Schottky electrowetting’.

Microfluidic manipulation of liquids by electrowetting was demonstrated first with mercury droplets in water and later with water in air and water in oil. Manipulation of droplets on a two-dimensional path was demonstrated later.
If the liquid is discretized and programmably manipulated, the approach is called &quot;Digital Microfluidic Circuits&quot; or &quot;Digital Microfluidics&quot;. Discretization by electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) was first demonstrated by Cho, Moon, and Kim.

==Electrowetting theory==

The electrowetting effect has been defined as &quot;the change in solid-electrolyte contact angle due to an applied potential difference between the solid and the electrolyte&quot;. The phenomenon of electrowetting can be understood in terms of the forces that result from the applied electric field. The fringing field at the corners of the electrolyte droplet tends to pull the droplet down onto the electrode, lowering the macroscopic contact angle and increasing the droplet contact area. Alternatively, electrowetting can be viewed from a thermodynamic perspective. Since the surface tension of an interface is defined as the Helmholtz free energy required to create a certain area of that surface, it contains both chemical and electrical components, and charge becomes a significant term in that equation. The chemical component is just the natural surface tension of the solid/electrolyte interface with no electric field. The electrical component is the energy stored in the capacitor formed between the conductor and the electrolyte.

The simplest derivation of electrowetting behavior is given by considering its thermodynamic model. While it is possible to obtain a detailed numerical model of electrowetting by considering the precise shape of the electrical fringing field and how it affects the local droplet curvature, such solutions are mathematically and computationally complex. The thermodynamic derivation proceeds as follows. Defining the relevant surface tensions as:
:formula_1 – The total, electrical and chemical, surface tension between the electrolyte and the conductor
:formula_2 – The surface tension between the electrolyte and the conductor at zero electric field
:formula_3 – The surface tension between the conductor and the external ambient
:formula_4 – The surface tension between the electrolyte and the external ambient
:formula_5 – The macroscopic contact angle between the electrolyte and the dielectric
:formula_6 – The capacitance per area of the interface, єrє0/t, for a uniform dielectric of thickness t and permittivity єr
:formula_7 – The effective applied voltage, integral of the electric field from the electrolyte to the conductor

Relating the total surface tension to its chemical and electrical components gives:
:formula_8

The contact angle is given by the Young-Dupre equation, with the only complication being that the total surface energy formula_9 is used:
:formula_10

Combining the two equations gives the dependence of θ on the effective applied voltage as:
:formula_11

An additional complication is that liquids also exhibit a saturation phenomenon: after certain voltage, the saturation voltage, the further increase of voltage will not change the contact angle, and with extreme voltages the interface will only show instabilities.

However, surface charge is but one component of surface energy, and other components are certainly perturbed by induced charge. So, a complete explanation of electrowetting is unquantified, but it should not be surprising that these limits exist.

It was recently shown by Klarman et al. that contact angle saturation can be explained as a universal effect- regardless of materials used – if electrowetting is observed as a global phenomenon affected by the detailed geometry of the system. Within this framework it is predicted that reversed electrowetting is also possible (contact angle grows with the voltage).

It has also been experimentally shown by Chevaloitt that contact angle saturation is invariant to all materials parameters, thus revealing that when good materials are utilized, most saturation theories are invalid. This same paper further suggests that electrohydrodynamic instability may be the source of saturation, a theory that is unproven but being suggested by several other groups as well.

==Reverse electrowetting==
Reverse electrowetting can be used to harvest energy via a mechanical-to-electrical engineering scheme.

==Electrowetting on liquid-infused film (EWOLF)==
Another electrowetting configuration is electrowetting on liquid-infused film. The liquid-infused film is achieved by locking a liquid lubricant in a porous membrane through the delicate control of wetting properties of the liquid and solid phases. Taking advantage of the negligible contact line pinning at the liquid-liquid interface, the droplet response in EWOLF can be electrically addressed with enhanced degree of switchability and reversibility compared to the conventional EWOD. Moreover, the infiltration of liquid lubricant phase in the porous membrane also efficiently enhances the viscous energy dissipation, suppressing the droplet oscillation and leading to fast response without sacrificing the desired electrowetting reversibility. Meanwhile, the damping effect associated with the EWOLF can be tailored by manipulating the viscosity and thickness of liquid lubricant.

==Opto- and photoelectrowetting==
Optoelectrowetting, and photoelectrowetting are both optically-induced electrowetting effects. Optoelectrowetting involves the use of a photoconductor whereas photoelectrowetting use a photocapacitance and can be observed if the conductor in the liquid/insulator/conductor stack used for electrowetting is replaced by a semiconductor. By optically modulating the number of carriers in the space-charge region of the semiconductor, the contact angle of a liquid droplet can be altered in a continuous way. This effect can be explained by a modification of the Young-Lippmann equation.

==Materials==
For reasons that are still under investigation, only a limited set of surfaces exhibit the theoretically predicted electrowetting behavior. Because of this, alternative materials that can be used to coat and functionalize the surface are used to create the expected wetting behavior. For example, amorphous fluoropolymers are widely used electrowetting coating materials, and it has been found that the behavior of these fluoropolymers can be enhanced by the appropriate surface patterning. These fluoropolymers coat the necessary conductive electrode, typically made of aluminum foil or indium tin oxide (ITO), to create the desired electrowetting properties. Three types of such polymers are commercially available: FluoroPel hydrophobic and superhydrophobic V-series polymers are sold by Cytonix, CYTOP is sold by Asahi Glass Co., and Teflon AF is sold by DuPont. Other surface materials such as SiO2 and gold on glass have been used. These materials allow the surfaces themselves to act as the ground electrodes for the electric current.

==Applications==
Electrowetting is now used in a wide range of applications, from modular to adjustable lenses, electronic displays (e-paper), electronic outdoor displays, and switches for optical fibers. Electrowetting has recently been evoked for manipulating soft matter particularly, suppressing coffee ring effect. Furthermore, filters with electrowetting functionality has been suggested for cleaning oil spills and separating oil-water mixtures.

==International meeting==
An international meeting for electrowetting is held every two years. The most recent meeting was held on June 18 to 20, 2018, at the University of Twente, the Netherlands.

The previous hosts of the electrowetting meeting are: Mons (1999), Eindhoven (2000), Grenoble (2002), Blaubeuren (2004), Rochester (2006), Los Angeles (2008), Pohang (2010), Athens (2012), Cincinnati (2014), Taipei (2016).

<text>Alfréd Haar (; 11 October 1885, Budapest – 16 March 1933, Szeged) was a Hungarian mathematician. In 1904 he began to study at the University of Göttingen. His doctorate was supervised by David Hilbert. The Haar measure, Haar wavelet, and Haar transform are named in his honor. Between 1912 and 1919 he taught at Franz Joseph University in Kolozsvár. Together with Frigyes Riesz, he made the University of Szeged a centre of mathematics. He also founded the &quot;Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum&quot; journal together with Riesz.

== Biography ==

Haar was born to a Hungarian-Jewish family in Budapest on 11 October 1885 to parents Ignác Haar and Emma Fuchs. He graduated in 1903 from the secondary school Fasori Evangélikus Gimnázium where he was a student of László Rátz. He started his university studies in Budapest, later moving on to Göttingen reading mathematics and sciences. Among the many famous professors he was taught by, he could count Loránd Eötvös, József Kürschák, Constantin Carathéodory, David Hilbert, Felix Christian Klein and Ernst Zermelo.

During years of the secondary school, he collaborated with the mathematical journal for secondary school students Középiskolai Matematikai Lapok, and won the national Eötvös Loránd Mathematical Competition. He enrolled to the Technical University of Budapest as a student of chemical engineering, but in the same year he moved on to the University of Budapest, and after a year to the University of Göttingen. His doctoral research was supervised by Hilbert graduating in June 1909. His 49-page thesis studies systems of Sturm–Liouville functions and spherical functions, introducing the now widely used Haar orthogonal systems. In the same year he habilitated to become a private professor of the university.

In 1912, the Franz Joseph University in Kolozsvár, Austria-Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) invited him along with Gyula Farkas and Frigyes Riesz to join as faculty, and he became the professor of &#x27;Quatitics&#x27;. A number of his lecture notes from the time became established books later. After the Treaty of Trianon, which ceded Transylvania to Romania, the university had to move to Szeged, the closest city within the new boundaries, where he with Riesz established the Centre of Mathematics, and the first internationally recognised Hungarian mathematical journal, the &quot;Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum&quot;.

One of his doctoral students at the University of Szeged was Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy.

Haar died of stomach cancer on 16 March 1933.

== Fields of research ==
His results are from the fields of mathematical analysis and topological groups, in particular he researched orthogonal systems of functions, singular integrals, analytic functions, differential equations, set theory, function approximation and calculus of variations.

<text>The economy of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany; GDR, DDR) was a command economy following the model of the Soviet Union based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Sharing many characteristics with fellow COMECON member states — the East German economy stood in stark contrast to the market and mixed economies of Western Europe and West Germany. The state established production targets, set prices, and also allocated resources, codifying these decisions in comprehensive plans. The means of production were almost entirely state-owned. The GDR had an above-average standard of living compared to other Eastern Bloc countries or the Soviet Union, and enjoyed favorable duty and tariff terms with the West German market; in 1989, it was estimated that 50 to 60% of its trade was with Western countries. However by the mid-1980s its economy had reached a state of stagnation, contributing to the process of German reunification.

==History==

===Soviet occupation period===

Each occupation power assumed authority in their respective zones by June 1945. The Allied powers originally pursued a common German policy, focused on denazification and demilitarization in preparation for the restoration of a democratic German nation-state.

Over time, the western and Soviet zones drifted apart economically. In 1946, the Soviet zone had a slight total factor productivity lead; wartime industrialization had contributed more to the eastern economy, and the destruction caused by the war was lighter than in the west. However, by 1948 the western zones had become more prosperous.

There were several reasons behind the backward economic situation in East Germany. While large sums had been poured into West Germany, especially by the United States, the Soviet Union not only put nothing into the economy of its zone but actually took out large amounts in reparations and occupation costs. Direct and indirect reparations paid by East Germany between 1946 and 1953 amounted to $14 billion in 1938 prices.

Military industries and those owned by the state, by Nazi Party members, and by war criminals were confiscated. These industries amounted to approximately 60% of total industrial production in the Soviet zone. Most heavy industry (constituting 20% of total production) was claimed by the Soviet Union as World War II reparations, and Soviet joint stock companies (German: &quot;Sowjetische Aktiengesellschaften&quot; - SAG) were formed. The remaining confiscated industrial property was nationalized, leaving 40% of total industrial production to private enterprise. The reparations seriously hindered the ability of East Germany to compete with West Germany economically.

While the dismantling of industrial capacity had a significant effect, the most important factor in explaining the initial divergence in economic performance was the separation of the eastern zone from its traditional West German market. The East German economy was dominated by consumer-goods manufacturers, and depended on raw materials and intermediate goods found exclusively in the West. East Germany had virtually no hard coal deposits, and only half of the fuel demand could be met domestically. In 1943 the East accounted for 0.5% of total output in coke, 1.6% in raw iron, and 6.9% in raw steel produced in post-war German territory. After the war, trade between East and West fell by a factor of 35.

Retail trade in the east was slowly being absorbed by two state-controlled organizations (&quot;Konsum&quot; and &quot;Handelsorganisation&quot;) which were given special preferences. On 2 January 1949, a two-year plan of economic reconstruction was launched, aiming at 81% of the 1936 production level, and, by cutting 30 per cent off production costs, hoping to raise the general wage level 12% to 15%. The plan also called for an increase in the daily food ration from 1,500 to 2,000 calories.

It was estimated that by 1949, 100 per cent of the automotive, between 90% and 100% of the chemical, and 93% of the fuel industries were in Soviet hands. By the end of 1950 East Germany had paid $3.7 bn of Russia&#x27;s $10 bn reparations demand. After the death of Joseph Stalin and the June 1953 uprising, the Soviet Union began to return the East German factories it had taken as reparations.

In May 1949, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Vishinsky claimed that production in the Soviet occupation zone in March 1949 had reached 96.6 per cent of its 1936 level and that the government budget of the Soviet zone showed a surplus of 1 billion East German Marks, despite a 30% cut in taxes.

The following case is typical of the economic relationship between the two eastern bloc countries. According to documents supplied by a shipbuilding official who escaped from the East, ships ordered by the Soviet Union for 1954 cost $148 million to build, but the Soviets paid only $46 million for them; the difference of $102 million was absorbed by the GDR.

===1950s===

The agrarian reform (&quot;Bodenreform&quot;) expropriated all land belonging to former Nazis and war criminals and generally limited ownership to . Some 500 &quot;Junker&quot; estates were converted into agricultural production cooperatives (German: &quot;Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft&quot; - LPG), and more than were distributed among 500,000 peasant farmers, agricultural laborers, and refugees. Compensation was paid only to active anti-Nazis. In September 1947 the Soviet military administration announced the completion of agrarian reform through the Soviet zone. This report listed 12,355 estates, totaling , which had been seized and redistributed to 119,000 families of landless farmers, 83,000 refugee families, and some 300,000 in other categories. State farms were also established, called &quot;Volkseigenes Gut&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Owned Property&quot;).

The Third Party Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (&quot;Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands&quot;—SED) convened in July 1950 and emphasized industrial progress. The industrial sector, employing 40% of the working population, was subjected to further nationalization, which resulted in the formation of the &quot;People&#x27;s Enterprises&quot; (German: &quot;Volkseigene Betriebe&quot;—VEB). These enterprises incorporated 75% of the industrial sector. The First Five Year Plan (1951–55) introduced centralized state planning; it stressed high production quotas for heavy industry and increased labor productivity. The pressures of the plan caused an exodus of GDR citizens to West Germany. The second SED Party Conference (less important than a party congress) convened from 9–12 July 1952. 1565 delegates, 494 guest-delegates, and over 2500 guests from the GDR and from many countries in the world participated in it. In the conference a new economic policy was adopted, &quot;Planned Construction of Socialism&quot;. The plan called to strengthen the state-owned sector of the economy. Further goals were to implement the principles of uniform socialist planning and to use the economic laws of socialism systematically.

By 1953, one out of every seven industrial companies had relocated to the West. Joseph Stalin died in March 1953. In June 1953, the SED, hoping to give workers an improved standard of living, announced the &quot;New Course&quot; which replaced the &quot;Planned Construction of Socialism.&quot; The New Course in the GDR was based on the economic policy initiated by Georgi Malenkov in the Soviet Union. Malenkov&#x27;s policy, which aimed at improvement in the standard of living, stressed a shift in investment toward light industry and trade and a greater availability of consumer goods. The SED, in addition to shifting emphasis from heavy industry to consumer goods, initiated a program for alleviating economic hardships. This led to a reduction of delivery quotas and taxes, the availability of state loans to private business, and an increase in the allocation of production material.

While the New Course increased the availability of consumer goods, there were still high production quotas. When work quotas were raised in 1953, it led to the uprising of June 1953. Strikes and demonstrations happened in major industrial centers, and workers demanded economic reforms. The &quot;Volkspolizei&quot; and the Soviet Army suppressed the uprising, in which approximately 100 participants were killed.

When the 1953 budget was introduced in the Volkskammer on 4 February, economic exploitation in the Soviet interest was still the dominant trend. The budget envisaged expenditures of 34.688 bn East marks, an increase of about 10% over the 31.730 bn of the 1952 budget. Its main object was to provide investments for strengthening the economy and for national defense.

In 1956, at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev repudiated Stalinism, in his so-called ‘Secret Speech’ to selected members of the Congress.

Around this time, an academic intelligentsia within the SED leadership demanded reform. To this end, Wolfgang Harich issued a platform advocating radical changes in the GDR. In late 1956, he and his associates were quickly purged from the SED ranks and imprisoned.

An SED party plenum in July 1956 confirmed Walter Ulbricht&#x27;s leadership and presented the Second Five-Year Plan (1956–60). The plan employed the slogan &quot;modernization, mechanization, and automation&quot; to emphasize the new focus on technological progress. At the plenum, the regime announced its intention to develop nuclear energy, and the first nuclear reactor in the GDR was activated in 1957. Decision was also made to build the first nuclear power reactor, the Rheinsberg Nuclear Power Plant, which started commercial production in 1966. The government increased industrial production quotas by 55% and renewed emphasis on heavy industry.

The Second Five-Year Plan committed the GDR to accelerated efforts toward agricultural collectivization and nationalization and completion of the nationalization of the industrial sector. By 1958 the agricultural sector still consisted primarily of the 750,000 privately owned farms that comprised 70% of all arable land; only 6,000 LPGs had been formed. In 1958–59 the SED placed quotas on private farmers and sent teams to villages in an effort to encourage voluntary collectivization. In November and December 1959 some law-breaking farmers were arrested by the Stasi.

An extensive economic management reform by the SED in February 1958 included the transfer of a large number of industrial ministries to the State Planning Commission. In order to accelerate the nationalization of industry, the SED offered entrepreneurs 50% partnership incentives for transforming their firms into VEBs.

===1960s===
By mid-1960, nearly 85% of all arable land was incorporated in more than 19,000 &quot;Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft&quot;; state farms comprised another 6%. By 1961 the socialist sector produced 90% of the GDR&#x27;s agricultural products. As more farmers fled to the West, a crop failure occurred in 1961, which was made worse by unfavorable weather.

At the close of 1960, private enterprise controlled only 9% of total industrial production. Production cooperatives (&quot;Produktionsgenossenschaften&quot;—PGs) incorporated one-third of the artisan sector during 1960–61, a rise from 6% in 1958. The opening of the new port of Rostock in 1960 reduced the country&#x27;s dependency on the West German port of Hamburg.

The Second Five-Year Plan encountered difficulties, and the government replaced it with the Seven-Year Plan (1959–65). The new plan aimed at achieving West Germany&#x27;s per capita production by the end of 1961, set higher production quotas, and called for an 85% increase in labor productivity. Emigration again increased, totaling 143,000 in 1959 and 199,000 in 1960. The majority of the emigrants were white collar workers, and 50% were under 25 years of age. The labor drain exceeded a total of 2.5 million citizens between 1949 and 1961.

The annual industrial growth rate declined steadily after 1959. The Soviet Union therefore recommended that East Germany implement the reforms of Soviet economist Evsei Liberman, an advocate of the principle of profitability and other market principles for communist economies.

In 1963 Ulbricht adapted Liberman&#x27;s theories and introduced the New Economic System (NES), an economic reform program providing for some decentralization in decision-making and the consideration of market and performance criteria. The NES aimed at creating an efficient economic system and transforming the GDR into a leading industrial nation.

Under the NES, the task of establishing future economic development was assigned to central planning. Decentralization involved the partial transfer of decision-making authority from the central State Planning Commission and National Economic Council to the Associations of People&#x27;s Enterprises (&quot;Vereinigungen Volkseigener Betriebe&quot;—VVB), parent organizations intended to promote specialization within the same areas of production. The central planning authorities set overall production goals, but each VVB determined its own internal financing, utilization of technology, and allocation of manpower and resources. As intermediary bodies, the VVBs also functioned to synthesize information and recommendations from the VEBs. The NES stipulated that production decisions be made on the basis of profitability, that salaries reflect performance, and that prices respond to supply and demand.

The NES brought forth a new elite in politics as well as in management of the economy, and in 1963 Ulbricht announced a new policy regarding admission to the leading ranks of the SED. Ulbricht opened the &quot;Politbüro&quot; and the Central Committee to younger members who had more education than their predecessors and who had acquired managerial and technical skills. As a consequence of the new policy, the SED elite became divided into political and economic factions, the latter composed of members of the new technocratic elite. Because of the emphasis on professionalization in the SED cadre policy after 1963, the composition of the mass membership changed: in 1967 about 250,000 members (14%) of the total 1.8 million SED membership had completed a course of study at a university, technical college, or trade school.

The SED emphasis on managerial and technical competence also enabled members of the technocratic elite to enter the top echelons of the state bureaucracy, formerly reserved for political dogmatists. Managers of the VVBs were chosen on the basis of professional training rather than ideological conformity. Within the individual enterprises, the number of professional positions and jobs for the technically skilled increased. The SED stressed education in managerial and technical sciences as the route to social advancement and material rewards. In addition, it promised to raise the standard of living for all citizens. From 1964 until 1967, real wages increased, and the supply of consumer goods, including luxury items, improved much.

The results of the reform, however, fell short of initial expectations, as growth was mostly the result of increased investment, rather than the new system of control. As a result, the reform plan was altered in 1967–1968, with the implementation of the &quot;Economic System of Socialism&quot;. The ESS was implemented through so-called structure-determining areas, strategic sectors which enjoyed preferential access to funds and resources. Those initially included chemicals, engineering and electronics, but as enterprises lobbied the government for inclusion in the list of strategically important projects, the list grew ever longer.

Industrial combines partnerships were formed to integrate vertically industries involved in the manufacture of vital final products. Price subsidies were restored to accelerate growth in favored sectors. The annual plan for 1968 set production quotas in the structure-determining areas 2.6% higher than in the remaining sectors to achieve industrial growth in these areas. The state set the 1969–70 goals for high-technology sectors even higher. Failure to meet ESS goals resulted in the conclusive termination of the reform effort in 1970.

The Altmark gas field was discovered in the late 1960s, providing an important source of foreign currency for the country.

===1970s-1990===

In the early 1970s, long-term, comprehensive planning began. It too provided general guidance, but over a longer period, fifteen or twenty years, long enough to link the five-year plans in a coherent manner.

The Main Task, introduced by First Secretary Erich Honecker in 1971, formulated domestic policy for the 1970s. The program re-emphasized Marxism-Leninism and the international class struggle. During this period, the SED launched a massive propaganda campaign to win citizens to its Soviet-style socialism and to restore the &quot;worker&quot; to prominence. The Main Task restated the economic goal of industrial progress, but this goal was to be achieved within the context of centralized state planning. Consumer socialism—the new program featured in the Main Task—was an effort to magnify the appeal of socialism by offering special consideration for the material needs of the working class. The state extensively revamped wage policy and gave more attention to increasing the availability of consumer goods.

The regime accelerated the construction of new housing and the renovation of existing apartments; 60% of new and renovated housing was allotted to working-class families. Rents, which were subsidized, remained extremely low. Because women constituted nearly 50% of the labor force, child-care facilities, including nurseries and kindergartens, were provided for the children of working mothers. Women in the labor force received salaried maternity leave which ranged from six months to one year. Retirement annuities were increased.

The last small and middle-sized private companies, which had hitherto operated semi-independently, were nationalized in 1972. Honecker proudly informed Leonid Brezhnev of this fact in 1973. In some cases, the owner of the company would continue as its director with a salary provided by the state, which bore no automatic resemblance to the operating efficiency of the enterprise. This was an unnecessary step and caused shortages of certain goods. The very enterprises which allowed some degree of initiative and response to the market and which contributed so largely to the economy as a whole, even earning desperately needed hard currency, became subject to central planning and controls and as stagnant as the rest of the economy. One such example was the toy manufacturer C.M. Breitung in Sonneberg in Thuringia which was independent till 1972 when it was taken over and renamed Plüti.
The global rise in commodity prices in the 1970s also affected East Germany, though later than elsewhere due to Comecon price controls. Due to the strong German tradition of drinking coffee, imports of this commodity were important for consumers. A massive rise in coffee prices in 1976–77 led to a quadrupling of the amount of hard currency needed to import coffee, an event known as the East German coffee crisis. This caused severe financial problems for the GDR, which perennially lacked sufficient hard currency to address imports from the West. As a result, in the summer of 1977 the &quot;Politbüro&quot; withdrew most cheaper brands of coffee from sale, limited the use of coffee in restaurants, and effectively withdrew its provision in public offices and state enterprises. In addition, an infamous new type of coffee was introduced, &quot;Mischkaffee&quot; (mixed coffee), which was 51% coffee and 49% a range of filler including chicory, rye, and sugar beet. Unsurprisingly, the new coffee was generally detested for its comparatively poor flavour, and the whole episode came to be informally known as the &quot;Coffee Crisis.&quot; The crisis passed after 1978 as world coffee prices began to fall again, as well as increased supply through an agreement between the GDR and Vietnam.

The GDR&#x27;s growing hard currency debts were a cause of domestic instability. After the Polish crisis of 1980-81, the West imposed a credit boycott on Eastern Bloc countries, including East Germany. The sale of Soviet crude oil, previously an important source of hard currency, became less profitable due to changes in the world economy. Soviet oil exports to the GDR were cut significantly in 1981, worsening the situation. A long period of underinvestment in research and capital goods made East German products uncompetitive on Western markets, leaving the country more reliant on the Soviet Union. The GDR faced insolvency in the early 1980s, but was able to delay bankruptcy through negotiating oil imports with the Soviet Union and export loans from France and Austria. A debt crisis was again averted through loans approved by West Germany in 1983 and 1984, in exchange for which the GDR agreed to loosen travel restrictions between the East and West.

The debt-to-GDP ratio reached 20% in 1989, a manageable level, but large in relation to the GDR&#x27;s capacity to export sufficient goods to the West to provide the hard currency to service those debts. In October 1989 a paper prepared for the &quot;Politbüro&quot; (the &quot;Schürer-Papier&quot;, after its principal author) projected a need to increase export surplus from around 2 billion DM in 1990 to over 11 billion DM by 1995 to stabilize debt levels. It is doubtful whether such a Herculean effort could have succeeded without political turmoil, or indeed at all.

Much of the debt originated from attempts by the GDR to export its way out of its international debt problems, which required imports of components, technologies and raw materials; as well as attempts to maintain living standards through imports of consumer goods. The GDR was internationally competitive in some sectors such as mechanical engineering and printing technology.

A significant factor was also the elimination of a ready source of hard currency through re-export of Soviet oil, which until 1981 was provided below world market prices; the resulting loss of hard currency income produced a noticeable dip in the otherwise steady improvement of living standards. (It was precisely this continuous improvement which was at risk due to the impending debt crisis; the Schürer-Papier&#x27;s remedial plans spoke of a 25–30% reduction.)

The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 further worsened the economic situation by draining the workforce and making it harder for state enterprises to obtain supplies. The collapse of the central planning authority caused a fall in production, bringing about shortages which in turn led to increasing levels of emigration.

On 1 July 1990 the country entered a monetary and economic union with West Germany, followed by the political dissolution of East Germany on 3 October 1990.

===Post-unification===

The immediate aftermath of unification saw a period of economic collapse as industrial production plummeted and a rapid increase in the unemployment rate. In the early 1990s the kombinats were handed over to the Treuhandanstalt (Public Trustee), a German federal agency responsible for reprivatizing former government-owned industrial assets. Interest in East German businesses proved underwhelming, as West German firms had no need for the excess production capacity to supply the new federal states. One-third of the firms were ultimately liquidated, which, combined with layoffs in the surviving firms, resulted in a 60% cut in employment in the new states.

==Sectors of the economy==
=== Agriculture ===
The agricultural sector of the economy had a somewhat different place in the system, although it too was thoroughly integrated. It was almost entirely collectivized except for private plots. The collective farms were formally self-governing. They were, however, subordinate to the Council of Ministers through the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Foodstuffs. A complex set of relationships also connected them with other cooperatives and related industries, such as food processing. By 1 July 1954, there were 4,974 collective farms with 147,000 members which cultivated 15.7 per cent of the arable land of the territory.

=== Industry ===

On 1 January 1954, the Soviet government turned over to the GDR thirty-three industrial concerns including the Leuna and Buna chemical works, and the GDR became the owner of all the enterprises in its territory.

Directly below the ministries were the centrally directed trusts, or &quot;Kombinate&quot;. Intended to be replacements for the Associations of Publicly Owned Enterprises—the largely administrative organizations that previously served as a link between the ministries and the individual enterprises—the &quot;Kombinate&quot; resulted from the merging of various industrial enterprises into large-scale entities in the late-1970s, based on interrelationships between their production activities.

The &quot;Kombinate&quot; included research enterprises, which the state incorporated into their structures to provide better focus for research efforts and speedier application of research results to production. A single, united management directed the entire production process in each &quot;Kombinat&quot;, from research to production and sales. The reform also attempted to foster closer ties between the activities of the &quot;Kombinate&quot; and the foreign trade enterprises by subordinating the latter to both the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the &quot;Kombinate&quot;. The goal of the &quot;Kombinat&quot; reform measure was to achieve greater efficiency and rationality by concentrating authority in the hands of midlevel leadership. The &quot;Kombinat&quot; management also provided significant input for the central planning process.

By the early 1980s, establishment of &quot;Kombinate&quot; for both centrally managed and district-managed enterprises was essentially complete. Particularly from 1982 to 1984, the government established various regulations and laws to define more precisely the parameters of these entities. These provisions tended to reinforce the primacy of central planning and to limit the autonomy of the &quot;Kombinate&quot;, apparently to a greater extent than originally planned. As of early 1986, there were 132 centrally managed &quot;Kombinate&quot;, with an average of 25,000 employees per &quot;Kombinat&quot;. District-managed &quot;Kombinate&quot; numbered 93, with an average of about 2,000 employees each.

At the base of the entire economic structure were the producing units. Although these varied in size and responsibility, the government gradually reduced their number and increased their size. The number of industrial enterprises in 1985 was only slightly more than a fifth that of 1960. Their independence decreased significantly as the &quot;Kombinate&quot; became fully functional.

== Central leadership ==
=== Socialist Unity Party of Germany ===
The ultimate directing force in the economy, as in every aspect of the society, was the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), particularly its top leadership. The party exercised its leadership role formally during the party congress, when it accepted the report of the general secretary, and when it adopted the draft plan for the upcoming five-year period.

More important was the supervision of the SED&#x27;s &quot;Politbüro&quot;, which monitored and directed ongoing economic processes. That key group, however, could concern itself with no more than the general, fundamental, or extremely serious economic questions, because it also had to deal with many other matters.

=== Government bureaucracy ===
At the head of the state apparatus responsible for formally adopting and carrying out policies elaborated by the party congress and &quot;Politbüro&quot; was the Council of Ministers, which had more than forty members and was in turn headed by a Presidium of sixteen. The Council of Ministers supervised and coordinated the activities of all other central bodies responsible for the economy, and it played a direct and specific role in important cases.

The State Planning Commission, sometimes called the &quot;Economic General Staff of the Council of Ministers,&quot; advised the Council of Ministers on possible alternative economic strategies and their implications, translated the general targets set by the council into planning directives and more specific plan targets for each of the ministries beneath it, coordinated short-, medium-, and long-range planning, and mediated interministerial disagreements.

The individual ministries had major responsibility for the detailed direction of the different sectors of the economy. The ministries were responsible within their separate spheres for detailed planning, resource allocation, development, implementation of innovations, and generally for the efficient achievement of their individual plans.

In addition to the basic structure of the industrial sector, a supplementary hierarchy of government organs reached down from the Council of Ministers and the State Planning Commission to territorial rather than functional subunits. Regional and local planning commissions and economic councils, subordinate to the State Planning Commission and the Council of Ministers, respectively, extended down to the local level. They considered such matters as the proper or optimal placement of industry, environmental protection, and housing.

== Central planning ==
The fact that the GDR had a planned economy did not mean that a single, comprehensive plan was the basis of all economic activity. An interlocking web of plans having varying degrees of specificity, comprehensiveness, and duration was in operation at all times; any or all of these may have been modified during the continuous process of performance monitoring or as a result of new and unforeseen circumstances. The resultant system of plans was extremely complex, and maintaining internal consistency between the various plans was a considerable task.

=== Short-term planning ===

Operationally, short-term planning was the most important for production and resource allocation. It covered one calendar year and encompassed the entire economy. The key targets set at the central level were overall rate of growth of the economy, volume and structure of the domestic product and its uses, use of raw materials and labor and their distribution by sector and region, and volume and structure of exports and imports. Beginning with the 1981 plan, the state added assessment of the ration of raw material use against value and quantity of output to promote more efficient use of scarce resources.

=== Five-year plans ===

Low-range (five-year) planning used the same indicators, although with less specificity. Although the five-year plan was duly enacted into law, it is more properly seen as a series of guidelines rather than as a set of direct orders. It was typically published several months after the start of the five-year period it covered, after the first one-year plan had been enacted into law. More general than a one-year plan, the five-year plan was nevertheless specific enough to integrate the yearly plans into a longer time frame. Thus it provided continuity and direction.

=== Planning mechanisms ===

In the first phase of planning, the centrally determined objectives were divided and assigned to appropriate subordinate units. After internal consideration and discussion had occurred at each level and suppliers and buyers had completed negotiations, the separate parts were reaggregated into draft plans. In the final stage, which follows the acceptance of the total package by the State Planning Commission and the Council of Ministers, the finished plan was redivided among the ministries, and the relevant responsibilities were distributed once more to the producing units.

The production plan was supplemented by other mechanisms that control supplies and establish monetary accountability. One such mechanism was the System of Material Balances, which allocated materials, equipment, and consumer goods. It acted as a rationing system, ensuring each element of the economy access to the basic goods it needed to fulfill its obligations. Since most of the goods produced by the economy were covered by this control mechanism, producing units had difficulty obtaining needed items over and above their allocated levels.

Another control mechanism was the assignment of prices for all goods and services. These prices served as a basis for calculating expenses and receipts. Enterprises had every incentive to use these prices as guidelines in decision-making. Doing so made plan fulfillment possible and earned bonus funds of various sorts for the enterprise. These bonuses were not allocated indiscriminately for gross output but were awarded for such accomplishments as the introduction of innovations or reduction of labor costs.

The system functioned smoothly only when its component parts were staffed with individuals whose values coincided with those of the regime or at least complemented regime values. Such a sharing took place in part through the integrative force of the party organs whose members occupied leading positions in the economic structure. Efforts were also made to promote a common sense of purpose through mass participation of almost all workers and farmers in organized discussion of economic planning, tasks, and performance. An East German journal reported, for example, that during preliminary discussion concerning the 1986 annual plan, 2.2 million employees in various enterprises and work brigades of the country at large contributed 735,377 suggestions and comments. Ultimate decision-making, however, came from above.

== Private sector ==
The private sector of the economy was small but not entirely insignificant. In 1985 about 2.8% of the net national product came from private enterprises. The private sector included private farmers and gardeners; independent craftsmen, wholesalers, and retailers; and individuals employed in so-called freelance activities (artists, writers, and others). Although self-employed, such individuals were strictly regulated. In 1985, for the first time in many years, the number of individuals working in the private sector increased slightly. According to East German statistics, in 1985 there were about 176,800 private entrepreneurs, an increase of about 500 over 1984. Certain private sector activities were quite important to the system. The SED leadership, for example, encouraged private initiative as part of an effort to upgrade consumer services.

In addition to those East Germans who were self-employed full-time, there were others who engaged in private economic activity on the side. The best known and most important examples were families on collective farms who also cultivated private plots (which could be as large as ). Their contribution was significant; according to official sources, in 1985 the farmers privately owned about 8.2% of pigs, 14.7% of sheep, 32.8% of horses, and 30% of laying hens in the country. Professionals such as commercial artists and doctors also worked privately in their free time, subject to separate taxes and other regulations. Their impact on the economic system, however, was negligible.

== Informal economy ==
More difficult to assess, because of its covert and informal nature, was the significance of that part of the private sector called the &quot;second economy.&quot; As used here, the term includes all economic arrangements or activities that, owing to their informality or their illegality, took place beyond state control or surveillance. The subject has received considerable attention from Western economists, most of whom are convinced that it is important in CPEs. In the mid-1980s, however, evidence was difficult to obtain and tended to be anecdotal in nature.

These irregularities did not appear to constitute a major economic problem. However, the East German press occasionally reported prosecutions of egregious cases of illegal &quot;second economy&quot; activity, involving what are called &quot;crimes against socialist property&quot; and other activities that are in &quot;conflict and contradiction with the interests and demands of society&quot;, as one report described the situation.

=== Barter economy ===
One kind of informal economic activity included private arrangements to provide goods or services in return for payment. An elderly woman might have hired a neighbour boy to haul coal up to her apartment, or an employed woman might have paid a neighbour to do her washing. Closely related would be instances of hiring an acquaintance to repair a clock, tune up an automobile, or repair a toilet. Such arrangements take place in any society, and given the deficiencies in the East German service sector, they may have been more necessary than in the West. They were doubtlessly common, and because they were considered harmless, they were not the subject of any significant governmental concern. Scarce goods from Westpakete were also highly desired for barter.

== Corruption ==
Another common activity that was troublesome if not disruptive was the practice of offering a sum of money beyond the selling price to individuals selling desirable goods, or giving something special as partial payment for products in short supply, the so-called &quot;Bückware&quot; (duck goods; sold from &quot;below the counter&quot;). Such ventures may have been no more than offering someone &quot;Trinkgeld&quot; (a tip), but they may have also involved &quot;Schmiergeld&quot; (bribes; lit. money used to &quot;grease&quot; a transaction) or &quot;Beziehungen&quot; (special relationships).

Opinions in East Germany varied as to how significant these practices were. But given the abundance of money in circulation and frequent shortages in luxury items and durable consumer goods, most people were perhaps occasionally tempted to provide a &quot;sweetener&quot;, particularly for such things as automobile parts or furniture.

<text>Arthur Karl Greiser (22 January 1897 – 21 July 1946) was a Nazi German politician, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;, &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich Governor) of the German-occupied territory of &quot;Wartheland&quot;. He was one of the persons primarily responsible for organizing the Holocaust in occupied Poland and numerous other crimes against humanity. He was arrested by the Americans in 1945, and was tried, convicted and executed by hanging in Poland in 1946 for his crimes, most notably genocide.

==Early life and career==
Greiser was born in Schroda (Środa Wielkopolska), Province of Posen, Imperial Germany, the son of a minor local bailiff (&quot;Gerichtsvollzieher&quot;). He learned to speak Polish fluently during his childhood. In 1903, he enrolled in elementary school, which was followed by two years of intermediate school and finally the Königlich-Humanistisches Gymnasium (Royal Humanities Secondary School) in Hohensalza. He left the Gymnasium in 1914 without receiving a diploma, as in August that year he volunteered to join the Imperial German Navy. He served in the Kiel harbour naval forts at Korugen, Falckenstein, and in the fortress tower of Laboe from August 1914 to July 1915. He was then assigned as an artillery observer in Flanders as well as participating in minesweeping operations in Friedrichsort. In April 1917, Greiser volunteered for service in the Naval Flying Corps, where he initially served as an observer with SEE I and II and then with Küstenfliegerstaffel I and II. From August 1917 to August 1918, he was assigned as a naval aviator to Marine Schutzstaffel I. During this time, he was transferred to Seeflugstation Flandern II (Ostend) and he later flew with the Seefrontstaffel and MFJ IV. From December 1917 to January 1918, he was attached to the KE-Schule Langfuhr (near Danzig, now Gdańsk). Whilst posted to combat duty, he flew missions over the North Sea between the southern English and Belgian coasts. He was later shot down and wounded by gunfire. On 30 September 1919, he was classified as 50% war-disabled and discharged from naval service.

Greiser earned the Iron Cross (First and Second Class), the Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918 and a Wound Badge in Black in 1914. From 1919 to May 1921, he served in the Freikorps &quot;Grenzschutz Ost&quot; and fought in the Baltic states.

==Joining the Nazi Party==
According to Richard Evans, Greiser was fanatically anti-Christian, and an early member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP number 166,635). After many years with the nationalist Deutschsoziale Partei (DtSP) founded by Richard Kunze and membership in &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; in the mid-1920s, he joined the NSDAP and SA on 1 December 1929, and the SS on 29 September 1931.
He was the Deputy President of the Free City of Danzig from 1933 to 1934 in the Rauschning Senate, and was made Senate President (Senatspräsident) in 1935–1939. As Senate President of Danzig, he was a rival to his nominal superior Albert Forster, &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the city since 1930. Greiser was part of the SS empire whilst Forster was closely aligned with the Nazi Party Mandarins Rudolf Hess and later Martin Bormann. On 23 August 1939 Forster replaced Greiser as Danzig&#x27;s head of state. At that time, the media saw Forster as a radical and Greiser as a moderate.

Greiser was accused by Poland as being directly responsible for escalating tensions between the Free City and the Republic of Poland in 1939. When the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister Józef Beck announced economic reprisals following the harassment of Polish frontier guards and customs officers, Greiser issued an announcement on 29 July 1939 declaring that the Danzig police no longer recognised their authority or power, and demanded their immediate withdrawal. The notice was so rudely worded that the Polish diplomatic representative to Danzig, Marian Chodacki, refused to forward it to Beck and instead sent a court summary.

==World War II==
Immediately following the German invasion of Poland, Greiser was transferred from Danzig and on 8 September was appointed &quot;Chef der Zivilverwaltung im Militärbezirk Posen&quot; or Chief of Civil Administration in the military district of Posen, which was annexed to the German Reich on 8 October 1939. The military administration ended and he was then appointed &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the newly created Reichsgau Posen on 21 October. At the same time he was named Reich Defense Commissioner of the newly established &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; XXI, consisting of the new Reichsgau. Additionally, he was appointed to the Prussian State Council. On 2 November, he was also named &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich Governor) of the new territory, thereby uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jurisdiction. On 29 January 1940, the region was renamed Reichsgau Wartheland. A member of several Nazi paramilitary organizations, Greiser was made a NSFK-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; as well as a NSKK-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; in April 1940. Finally, on 30 January 1942, he was promoted to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;.

The territory over which Greiser ruled was potentially very rich – the Prussian Imperial province of Posen had been the breadbasket of Wilhelmine Germany before 1914, possessed an excellent rail and road network, and a comparatively healthy and well educated workforce; Litzmanstadt (Łódź) had developed a fairly sophisticated industrial base during the 19th century. Although every &quot;Gauleiter&quot; was expected to fully Germanize his assigned area by any means, Greiser emphasized brutality to achieve this goal. He was an ardent racist who enthusiastically pursued an &#x27;ethnic cleansing&#x27; program to rid the Warthegau of Poles and to resettle the &#x27;cleansed&#x27; areas with ethnic Germans. This was along the lines of the racial theories espoused by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler. Mass expulsions of Poles from the Warthegau to the General Government and summary executions were the norm. A Polish servant in Greiser&#x27;s house described him as &quot;a powerfully built figure. He was a tall man, you could see his arrogance, his conceit. He was so vain, so full of himself—as if there was nothing above him, a god, almost. Everybody tried to get out of his way, people had to bow to him, salute him. And the Poles, he treated them with great contempt. For him the Poles were slaves, good for nothing but work&quot;. Greiser himself stated his beliefs: &quot;If, in past times, other peoples enjoyed their century-long history by living well, and doing so by getting foreign peoples to work for them without compensating them accordingly and without meting out justice to them, then we too, as Germans want to learn from this history. No longer must we stand in the wings; on the contrary, we must altogether become a master race!&quot;.

In addition to mass deportation, Greiser&#x27;s district was also at the forefront of &quot;internal&quot; racial cleansing according to Nazi ideals. His subordinate Wilhelm Koppe provided the &#x27;Special Detachment (&quot;Sonderkommando&quot;) Lange&#x27; to the nearby Gau of East Prussia during May and June 1940. This SS squad gassed 1558 patients from mental asylums at the Soldau concentration camp and then returned to his region to continue this process.

Greiser was involved in the resettlement of German refugees from lands annexed to the Soviet Union in 1939 and 1940. Between October and December 1939, nearly 60,000 &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic Germans) arrived in Germany from the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia. Evidently Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt (later employed as translator for General Andrey Vlasov) was in this group, as he &quot;resettled&quot; in Posen. Neighbouring &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and rival Albert Forster refused them entry, and they were largely settled in properties seized from Poles in Poznań and across the Wartheland. However even Greiser was wary, noting that many were elderly and urbanized aristocrats with a strong class consciousness, not the virile peasant warrior types idolized by the SS. Closer to his heart were the over 100,000 ethnic Germans who were evacuated from Volhynia and eastern Galicia. These were mostly farmers and rural people, and, learning from the Baltic experience, Łódź in eastern Wartheland was designated the main Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VoMi) reception centre. In May 1940 a further 30,000 Volksdeutsche were relocated from the Nazi General Government of Poland to Greiser&#x27;s domain. After 1941 a further 300,000 ethnic Germans were evacuated from Russia and Ukraine to Wartheland during the German invasion and occupation of the Soviet Union. Greiser&#x27;s Poznań was considered the Germanised city par excellence, and on 3 August 1943 he hosted a national gathering of &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and senior Nazis, including Martin Bormann, Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler.

===Anti-Church campaign===
Richard J. Evans wrote that the Catholic Church was the institution that, &quot;more than any other had sustained Polish national identity over the centuries&quot;. The Nazi plan for Poland entailed the destruction of the Polish nation. This necessarily required attacking the Polish Church, particularly in those areas annexed to Germany. Greiser, with the encouragement of Reinhard Heydrich and Martin Bormann, launched a severe attack on the Catholic Church. He cut off support to the Church from the state and from outside influences such as the Vatican and Germany. In July 1940 he instituted Bormann&#x27;s anti-church &quot;thirteen point&quot; measures in the territory. The anti-church measures, which had Hitler&#x27;s approval, suggest how the Nazis aimed to «&#x27;de-church&#x27; German society».

Catholic Church properties and funds were confiscated, and lay organisations shut down. Evans wrote that &quot;Numerous clergy, monks, diocesan administrators and officials of the Church were arrested, deported to the General Government, taken off to a concentration camp in the Reich, or simply shot. Altogether some 1700 Polish priests ended up at Dachau: half of them did not survive their imprisonment.&quot; Greiser&#x27;s administrative chief August Jäger had earlier led the effort at Nazification of the Evangelical Church in Prussia. In Poland, he earned the nickname &quot;Kirchenjäger&quot; (Church Hunter) for the vehemence of his hostility to the Church. &quot;By the end of 1941&quot;, wrote Evans, &quot;the Polish Catholic Church had been effectively outlawed in the Wartheland. It was more or less Germanized in the other occupied territories, despite an encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII as early as 27 October 1939 protesting against this persecution.&quot;

===Holocaust===
SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Greiser actively participated in the Holocaust. Early in 1940, Greiser is on record challenging Hermann Göring over efforts to delay the expulsion of Łódź Jews to Poland. On 18 September 1941, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Himmler informed Greiser that he intended to transfer 60,000 Czech and German Jews to the Łódź ghetto until spring 1942, when they would be &quot;resettled&quot;. The first transport arrived a few weeks later, and Greiser sought and received permission from Himmler to kill 100,000 Jews in his area. He then instructed HSSPF Wilhelm Koppe to manage the overcrowding. Koppe and SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Herbert Lange proceeded to manage the problem by experimenting at a country estate at Chełmno nad Nerem with gas vans, establishing the first extermination unit which ultimately carried out the mass murder of approximately 150,000 Jews between late 1941 and April 1942. Furthermore, on 6 October 1943 Greiser hosted a national assembly of senior SS officers in Posen at which Himmler candidly spoke of the mass executions of civilians (the infamous Posen Speech). Greiser&#x27;s mass murder operations were coordinated by SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Herbert Mehlhorn.

On 20 January 1945, Greiser ordered a general evacuation of Posen (having received a telegram from Bormann relaying Hitler&#x27;s order to leave the city). Greiser left the city the same evening and reported to Himmler&#x27;s personal train in Frankfurt an der Oder. There Greiser found that he had been tricked by Bormann. Hitler had announced that Posen must be held at all costs, and Greiser was now viewed as a deserter and coward, particularly by Goebbels, who in his diary on 2 March 1945 labeled Greiser &quot;a real disgrace to the (Nazi) Party&quot;, but his recommendations for punishment after the capture of Poznań were ignored.

He surrendered to the Americans in Austria in 1945.

==Trial and execution==

After the war, the Polish government (the Supreme National Tribunal) tried Greiser for war crimes. His defence that he was only following orders did not hold up as it was shown that other &quot;Gauleiter&quot;s had not followed a similar policy. For example, Albert Forster, &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Danzig-West Prussia (the other German-annexed section of occupied Poland), simply declared all Poles in his area who were reasonably proficient in German to be Germans (although he was guilty of the elimination of the Jewish population under his jurisdiction either by murder or deportation). Greiser&#x27;s advocates, Stanisław Hejmowski and Jan Kręglewski, tried to convince the Tribunal that Greiser, as a head of a formally independent state, the Free City of Danzig, could not be judged by another country, an argument rejected by the court. Greiser was convicted of the following:
*genocide and the murder of civilians and POWs;
*torture, persecution, and injuring civilians and POWs;
*organized and systematic destruction of Polish culture, plunder of Polish cultural heritage, Germanisation of the country and the Polish people, illegal appropriation of public property;
*organised and systematic looting of Polish property;
*insulting and deriding the Polish nation by propagating the idea of its cultural inferiority and low social worth;
*forcibly expelling individuals, families, neighbourhoods and whole districts to the General Government or forced labour camps in the German Reich;
*persecution and murder of Polish Jews by killing them in their places of residence, grouping them in closed ghettos from which they were sent to the Chelmno extermination camp for extermination in gas chambers, deriding the Jewish people in actions and words, causing physical suffering, injury and humiliation of human dignity;
*taking Polish children against the will of their parents or guardians, forcibly putting them in German families or public orphanages within the Reich while severing all contacts with their families and nation by giving them German names.

The Tribunal decided that Greiser was guilty of all charges and sentenced him to death by hanging, civil death, and confiscation of all his property. In the early morning of 21 July 1946 he was transported from prison to the slope of Fort Winiary where he was hanged before a large crowd, despite a plea from Pope Pius XII that his life be spared.

<doc id="491243" wikidata="Q5342941" url="?curid=491243" title="Edward Floyd (impeached barrister)">
<text>Edward Floyd, Floud or Lloyd (died 1648) was an Englishman impeached and sentenced by the Parliament of England in 1621 for speaking disparagingly of Frederick V, Elector Palatine (by Floyd&#x27;s Case).

==Early life==

Floyd was a Roman Catholic barrister. He became steward in Shropshire to Lord Chancellor Ellesmere and Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk.

==Floyd&#x27;s case==
In 1621, when he was in the Fleet Prison at the instance (doing) of the Privy Council, he was impeached by the House of Commons for having said:

I have heard that Prague is taken; and Goodman Palsgrave and Goodwife Palsgrave have taken their heels; and as I have heard, Goodwife Palsgrave is taken prisoner.

These words, it was alleged, he spoke in a scornful manner, to insult the Prince Palatine and his wife Elizabeth of Bohemia, who was daughter to James I of England. The case led to an important constitutional decision on which forums can hold criminal trials with a political dimension and what permission is needed from the Crown and any second House. Shortly before the case, the Commons had looked for precedents supporting their judicial role. They found none save as to contempt for (being in contempt of) the House. During the proceedings they demurred on this lack of precedent. They had to concede the point.

===Case in the Commons===
The case came to the House of Commons on 30 April. By then it had been in session since February. It had done nothing on the situation in Bohemia, where the Elector Palatine and his English princess wife had been heavily defeated in a conflict that formed the first phase of the Thirty Years War. On that day the influential parliamentarian Sir Edwin Sandys encouraged the Commons to take punitive action. The feeling of the House was that in this matter they could make their mark in foreign policy, not otherwise in their remit.

The Commons agreed on 1 May that Floyd should pay a fine of £1,000 (), stand in the pillory at three stands for two hours at each, and be carried from place to place on a horse without a saddle, with his face towards the horse&#x27;s tail, and holding the tail in his hand. The king, however, objected to the Commons taking up the matter. The next morning he sent (an agent) to inquire upon what precedents the Commons grounded their claim to act as a judicial body in regard to offences which did not concern their privileges. He also pointed out that they had failed to get his approval, and had not granted Floyd due process. Sandys by now had thought better of direct judgement; he argued that as the Speaker had signed nothing, the decision of the Commons was not yet effective. The momentum of the House was against him. Sir Edward Coke pressed for enforcibility, invoking his favoured view of the Commons as court of record. William Noy warned against passing judgement relating to overseas matters.

Two days later the Commons petitioned the king to be allowed their sentence. He argued that it was quite unclear what jurisdiction they were claiming; but agreed to consider the petition and to act in the matter of Floyd. But on 4 May he sent the matter to the House of Lords - poorly timed as (as Sandys had already argued) the upper house was preoccupied with efforts to undermine George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.

===The House of Lords intervenes===
On 5 May the Commons and Lords conferred on the case. Coke worked to salvage the concept of the Commons as court of record, by having the prior record annulled as the lesser of two evils, since the king and Lords appeared set to deny the claim.

A debate of several days then led to a conference of the two houses, when it was agreed that the accused should be arraigned before the Lords, and that a declaration should be entered on the journals that his trial before the commons should not prejudice the just rights of either house.

===Second sentence and its execution===
The Lords added to the severity of the first judgment. On 26 May, Floyd was condemned to be degraded from the &quot;estate&quot; (state) of a gentleman; his testimony not to be received; he was to be branded, whipped at the cart&#x27;s tail, fined £5,000, and imprisoned in Newgate Prison for life. When he was branded in Cheapside he declared that he would have given £1,000 to be hanged in order that he might be a martyr in so good a cause.

Some days later, on the motion of Prince Charles, it was agreed by the lords that the whipping should not be inflicted, and an order was made that in future judgment should not be pronounced, when the sentence was more than imprisonment, on the same day on which it was voted. The remainder of the sentence on Floyd seems to have resulted save that he was liberated on 16 July, after the new Lord Chancellor John Williams had prevailed with George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham to recommend to James I an exercise of his prerogative of mercy in the case of political prisoners.

On the petition of Joane, his wife, the Lords on 6 December ordered his trunk and writings to be delivered up to her; the clerk first taking out Catholic books and religious objects.

==Evaluation and archive==
Henry Hallam criticised the proceedings. Joseph Robson Tanner in 1930 wrote in examining the constitution that the English House of Commons had clearly exceeded their jurisdiction. Charles Howard McIlwain commented that the claim the House made for jurisdiction under parliamentary privilege was &quot;the most extensive and the least justifiable, perhaps, in all parliamentary history; and the far-fetched arguments brought forward in debates in support of the claim are of great interest&quot;, citing the record in Thomas Barrington&#x27;s diary of the parliament.

A collection, made by Sir Harbottle Grimstone, of the proceedings is kept as Harleian MS. 6274, art. 2.

==Reception and legacy==
The manga was a hit, having sold approximately 15 million copies, which makes it one of the best-selling &quot;shōjo&quot; manga series of all time. Although the television series initially received low ratings, reruns were more positively received by fans, as well as the second series. The anime is considered a hit on Japanese television and though aimed toward schoolgirls it was popular among people of both sexes, and was also popular in Europe. In 2001, the anime magazine &quot;Animage&quot; ranked the 1979 anime television as the twenty-second of the Top 100 anime productions of all time. In 2005, TV Asahi conducted a &quot;Top 100&quot; online web poll and nationwide survey asking viewers for the best anime television series; &quot;Aim for the Ace!&quot; was placed fourteenth in the online poll and thirty-fourth in the survey. Responsible for a tennis boom among high school students in the 1970s, the series was still popular as of 2015 appearing in several online web polls of most influential sports anime. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150.000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Aim for the Ace!&quot; ranked 44th.

Considered a classic, the series has been influential in Japan both in fiction and in real life. In addition to being a landmark in the sports genre and an inspiration for other sports anime, it has set many of the conventions of &quot;yuri&quot;. Its story has been imitated by other anime to the point that it became a cliché; it established the tradition of &quot;the klutzy wallflower with hidden potential, the rich bitch who wants all the attention, and a handsome Coach with a tragic fate&quot; in the words of anime critic Jonathan Clements. Gainax&#x27;s science fiction OVA &quot;Gunbuster&quot; incorporated the set-up and the style of &quot;Aim for the Ace!&quot;, acting as parody to the series. Anime series &quot;Oh! Super Milk-chan&quot;″s opening theme also included parodies of the anime. Anime director Kenji Kamiyama, most known for the &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot; series, cited the series among the 15 best anime of all time. Shuzo Matsuoka, considered &quot;the first successful Japanese [tennis] player&quot;, was influenced to play because of the esteem he had on the series.

Justin Sevakis, writing for Anime News Network, and Erica Friedman, founder of Yuricon, consider the series a &quot;true&quot; &quot;shōjo&quot;. Friedman wrote, &quot;As a representative of early shoujoai, &quot;Ace wo Nerae&quot; is a spectacular example, but expect a fair dollop of cheesy-ness, as the character designs, music, art, etc are all over 30 years old. The op art graphics and laughable opening theme are delightfully retro now. The most important thing is that the characters are genuinely likeable and their motivations fathomable.&quot; Sevakis praised the story as having &quot;purity&quot;, as &quot;There are no manufactured obstacles to overcome.&quot; He also declared, &quot;Despite being Western-looking and ostensibly about universally accessible sport of tennis, it&#x27;s a fascinating look at Japanese personal motivation, interaction and decorum,&quot; playing &quot;like a catalog of Japan&#x27;s most interesting cultural quirks.&quot; Art-wise it was compared to &quot;Dear Brother&quot; and &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; by Anime News Network&#x27;s Lynzee Loveridge, who said it &quot;reinforces a lot of the dangerous work ethic that permeates sports series, like battling through a serious injury or abandoning emotional &#x27;dalliances&#x27; like romance.&quot;

===Video game adaptations===
Several games based on &quot;Aim for the Ace!&quot; have been released in Japan. Nippon Telenet adapted the series into a Super Famicom video game, which they published on December 22, 1993. Tristar published two video game adaptations for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X; the first was released on November 30, 2002, and the second on December 3, 2004. In 2009, Olympia distributed an &quot;Ace o Nerae!&quot;-themed pachinko machine under its Gold Olympia brand. Ace Denken released a different machine in 2011.

===Television drama===
In November 2003, the production of a Japanese television drama series was announced. It was broadcast by Japanese network TV Asahi in nine episodes between January 15, 2004, and March 11, 2004. It was directed by Hidetomo Matsuda, Shunji Muguruma and Yoshinori Kobayashi, produced by Motohiro Matsumoto and Shizuo Sekiguchi, and the screenwriters were Akiyo Takikawa, Naoya Takayama and Hiroko Kanasugi. Shuzo Matsuoka, a former Japanese professional tennis player, served the supervisor of the tennis scenes.

The music was composed by Norihito Sumitomo; the series homonymous opening theme song is sung by Hiromi and the closing theme was &quot;Ai no Tame ni.&quot; by Aya Uetowho also starred in the leading role. On July 23, 2004, Geneon Universal released the series on DVD; it was available as five individual volumes or as a DVD box set. Its soundtrack was published by Nippon Columbia on September 22, 2004. Serving as a sequel to the series, a special episode was aired on September 23, 2004, and then was released on DVD on December 22 by Geneon Universal.

Out of the nine episodes, three were featured on the top ten list of the most-watched dramas in the week. The second one appeared in the eighth place with a 15.3 percent television viewership rating, the eighth episode reached the tenth place with 14.8 percent, and the last occupied the ninth spot with 14.2 percent.

<text>The Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences was established in 1996. It is in a renovated three-story Edwardian-style building, at 2 Caine Lane at the Sheung Wan, Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. It is also referred to as Old Pathological Institute.

The aim of the museum is to promote the collection and preservation of materials of historical interest relating to the development of the medical industry in Hong Kong. On occasion, exhibitions are held by the museum to present basic and advanced medical information and news. One of its major goals is to help raise public interest in the medical history of Hong Kong and teach them more about health and diseases.

==History==
The building that would later become Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences was built in 1906. It was designed as a Bacteriological Institute and renamed to Pathological Institute after World War II. The building was designed by Leigh &amp; Orange.

Being the first laboratory of bacteriology in Hong Kong, it was constructed of red bricks and consisted of three blocks. The main block is a two-storey building with a basement. The second one was used as a dormitory and the third for keeping animals.

In 1972, the institute was relocated to Victoria Road and the building was then used as a storeroom for Pathology Service for the Health Department.

The building was declared a monument in 1990. In 1995, it was handed over to the Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences Society and converted to a public museum where it was opened on 16 March the following year.

==Features==
It is a three-tier building occupying and it consists of 11 exhibition galleries including a gallery for Tai Ping Shan View, a game room, a library and the Gordon King Lecture Theatre. There is an entry fee charged at the museum of 20 Hong Kong Dollars per person. 

The galleries include:
* Lui Hac Minh Gallery
* Hong Kong Tuberculosis, Chest and Heart Diseases Association Gallery
* Hong Kong College of Radiologists

==Goal==
The aim of the museum is to exhibit and educate the public about Hong Kong&#x27;s medical history and to preserve historical medical materials relating to the local development of medicine.

Publications and leaflets are distributed to the public occasionally to help arouse the interest of the public in the medical history of Hong Kong and increase their knowledge and understanding of health and diseases.

==Transportation==
The museum is in walking distance southwest from Sheung Wan station of MTR.

Visitors can take Citybus or NWFB bus services 12, 12M, 13, 23, 23B, 40, 40M or 103 and alight at the bus stop named &quot;Seymour Road&quot; on Caine Road.

<doc id="491257" wikidata="Q379953" url="?curid=491257" title="Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully">
<text>Maximilien de Béthune Sully, 1st Prince of Sully, Marquis of Rosny and Nogent, Count of Muret and Villebon, Viscount of Meaux (13 December 156022 December 1641) was a French nobleman, soldier, statesman, and counselor of King Henry IV of France. Historians emphasize Sully&#x27;s role in building a strong, centralized administrative system in France using coercion and highly effective new administrative techniques. While not all of his policies were original, he used them well to revitalize France after the European Religious Wars. Most, however, were repealed by later monarchs who preferred absolute power. Historians have also studied his Neostoicism and his ideas about virtue, prudence, and discipline.

==Biography==
===Early years===

He was born at the Château de Rosny near Mantes-la-Jolie into a branch of the House of Béthune a noble family originating in Artois, and was brought up in the Reformed faith, a Huguenot. In 1571, at the age of eleven, Maximilien was presented to Henry of Navarre and remained permanently attached to the future king of France. The young Baron of Rosny was taken to Paris by his patron and was studying at the &quot;Collège de Bourgogne&quot; at the time of the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre, from which he escaped by discreetly carrying a Catholic book of hours under his arm. He studied mathematics and history at the court of Henry of Navarre.

===A warrior with Henry===
On the renewed outbreak of civil war in 1575, he enlisted in the Protestant army. In 1576 he accompanied the Duke of Anjou, younger brother of king Henri III, on an expedition into the Netherlands in order to regain the former Rosny estates, but being unsuccessful he attached himself for a time to the Prince of Orange. Later, rejoining Henry of Navarre in Guyenne, he displayed bravery in the field and particular ability as a military engineer. 
In 1583 he acted as Henry&#x27;s special agent in Paris, and during a respite in the Wars of Religion he married an heiress who died five years later.

On the renewal of civil war, Rosny again joined Henry of Navarre, and at the battle of Ivry (1590) he was seriously wounded. He counselled Henry IV&#x27;s conversion to Roman Catholicism (made official on 25 July 1593) but steadfastly refused to become a Catholic himself. Once Henry IV of France&#x27;s succession to the throne was secured (), the faithful and trusted Rosny received his reward in the shape of numerous estates and dignities.

===Sully in power===
From 1596, when he was added to Henry&#x27;s finance commission, Rosny introduced some order into France&#x27;s economic affairs. Acting as sole Superintendent of Finances at the end of 1601, he authorized the free exportation of grain and wine, reduced legal interest, established a special court to try cases of speculation, forbade provincial governors to raise money on their own authority, and otherwise removed many abuses of tax collecting. Rosny abolished several offices, and by his honest, rigorous conduct of the country&#x27;s finances, he was able to save an average of a million &quot;livres&quot; a year between 1600 and 1610.

His achievements were not solely financial. In 1599, he was appointed grand commissioner of highways and public works, superintendent of fortifications and grand master of artillery; in 1602, governor of Nantes and of Jargeau, captain-general of the Queen&#x27;s &quot;gens d&#x27;armes&quot; and governor of the Bastille; in 1604, he was governor of Poitou; and in 1606, made first duke of Sully and a pair de France, ranking next to princes of the blood. He declined the office of constable of France because he would not become a Roman Catholic.
Sully encouraged agriculture, urged the free circulation of produce, promoted stock-raising, forbade the destruction of the forests, drained swamps, built roads and bridges, planned a vast system of canals and actually began the Canal de Briare. He strengthened the French military establishment; under his direction, the construction of a great line of defences on the frontiers began. Abroad, Sully opposed the king&#x27;s colonial policy as inconsistent with French interests, in opposition to men like Champlain who urged greater colonial efforts in Canada and elsewhere. Neither did Sully show much favor toward industrial pursuits but, on the urgent solicitation of the king, he established a few silk factories. He fought together with Henry IV in Savoy (1600–1601) and negotiated the treaty of peace in 1602. In 1603, he represented Henry at the court of James I of England, and arranged gifts of jewellery for influential courtiers. Throughout the reign of Henry IV, he helped the king to put down insurrections of the nobles, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant. It was Sully, too, who arranged the marriage between Henry IV and Marie de&#x27; Medici.

===Fall from power and last years===
The political role of Sully effectively ended with the assassination of Henry IV on 14 May 1610. The king was on his way to visit Sully, who lay ill in the Arsenal; his purpose was to make final preparations for imminent military intervention in the disputed succession to Jülich-Cleves-Berg after the death of Duke John William. The intervention on behalf of a Calvinist candidate would have brought the king in conflict with the Catholic Habsburg dynasty.

After the death of Henry IV Sully published, in the deceased king&#x27;s name, his ‘Grand Design’, a plan to stop the religious wars. His starting point was that the three churches (Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist) were there to stay. He planned an international organization, consisting of a Europe of 15 more or less equally strong powers, incidentally dissolving the Habsburg empire and thus making France Europe’s strongest state. A balance of power mechanism and a permanent assembly of ambassadors should prevent wars in Europe. Military power would only be needed towards the Muslim Ottoman Empire.

Although a member of the Queen&#x27;s council of regency, his colleagues were not inclined to put up with his domineering leadership, and after a stormy debate he resigned as superintendent of finances on 26 January 1611, retiring into private life.

The queen mother gave him 300,000 &quot;livres&quot; for his long services and confirmed him in possession of his estates. He attended the meeting of the Estates-General in 1614, and on the whole was in sympathy with the policy and government of Richelieu. He disavowed the Blockade of La Rochelle, in 1621, but in the following year was briefly arrested.

The baton of marshal of France was conferred on him on 18 September 1634. The last years of his life were spent chiefly at Villebon, Rosny and his château of Sully. He died at Villebon at the age of 81.

==Family==
By his first wife, Anne de Courtenay (1564-1589), daughter of François, Lord of Bontin, he had one son, Maximilien, Marquess of Rosny (1587–1634), who led a life of dissipation and debauchery. By his second wife, Rachel de Cochefilet (1566–1659), the widow of François Hurault, Lord of Chateaupers, whom he married in 1592 and who turned Protestant to please him, he had nine children, of whom six died young. Their son François (1598–1678) was created first Duke of Orval. The elder daughter Marguerite (1595–1660) in 1605, married Henri, Duke of Rohan, while the younger Louise in 1620 married Alexandre de Lévis, Marquess of Mirepoix.

His brother, Philippe de Béthune, was sent as ambassador to James VI of Scotland in May 1599. He was given a good welcome and invited to Falkland Palace. He went on a progress with James VI to Inchmurrin and Hamilton Palace, after the king had written to the Laird of Wemyss for the loan of his best hackney horse and saddle.

==Accomplishments==
Sully was very unpopular because he was a favorite and was seen as selfish, obstinate, and rude. He was hated by most Catholics because he was a Protestant, and by most Protestants because he was faithful to the king. 
He amassed a large personal fortune, and his jealousy of all other ministers and favorites was extravagant. Nevertheless, he was an excellent man of business, inexorable in punishing malversation and dishonesty on the part of others, and opposed to ruinous court expenditures that was the bane of almost all European monarchies in his day. He was gifted with executive ability, with confidence and resolution, with fondness for work, and above all with deep devotion to his master. He was implicitly trusted by Henry IV and proved himself the most able assistant of the king in dispelling the chaos into which the religious and civil wars had plunged France. After Henry IV, Sully was a major driving force behind the happy transformation in France between 1598 and 1610, in which agriculture and commerce benefitted, and peace and internal order were reestablished.

During his life, Sully inherited or acquired the following titles:
*Duke of Sully
* Peer of France
* Marshal of France
* Sovereign Prince of Henrichemont and Boisbelle
* Marquess of Rosny

* Lord of various other places

== Works ==
Sully left a collection of memoirs (&quot;Mémoires&quot;, otherwise known as the &quot;Économies royales&quot;, 1638) written in the second person. They are very valuable sources for the history of their time and as an autobiography, in spite of their containing many fictions, such as a mission undertaken by Sully to Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1601. One his most famous works was perhaps the idea of a Europe composed of 15 roughly equal states, under the direction of a &quot;Very Christian Council of Europe&quot;, charged with resolving differences and disposing of a common army. This famous &quot;Grand Design&quot;, a utopian plan for a Christian republic, is often cited as one of the first grand plans and ancestors for the European Union. Two folio volumes of the memoirs were splendidly printed, nominally at Amsterdam, but really under Sully&#x27;s own eye, at his château of Sully in 1638; two other volumes appeared posthumously in Paris in 1662.

<text>Port Bell is a small industrial centre in the greater metropolitan Kampala area, in Uganda. Port Bell has a rail link and a railroad ferry wharf used for International traffic across Lake Victoria to Tanzania and Kenya.

==Location==
Port Bell is located in Nakawa Division, one of the five administrative divisions of the city of Kampala. It is a subdivision of the greater Luzira area in the south-eastern part of the city. It is located at the end of a narrow inlet of Lake Victoria, approximately , by road, south-east of the central business district of Kampala, Uganda&#x27;s capital and largest city. The coordinates of Port Bell are 0°17&#x27;20.0&quot;N, 32°39&#x27;13.0&quot;E (Latitude:0.288900; Longitude:32.653620).

==Overview==
The port is named after Henry Hesketh Bell, a British commissioner, who took over administration of Britain&#x27;s interests in Uganda in 1906. Its rail link is a branch line from the Kampala-Jinja main line.

Lake Victoria ferries operate from Port Bell linking Kampala to other railhead ports on Lake Victoria including Jinja, Kisumu, Musoma, and Mwanza.

When the first stage of the Uganda Railway was completed in 1901, the railhead was at Kisumu, 12 hours journey from Port Bell by ship. Ferries brought goods by lake between Port Bell and Kisumu. It was not until 1931 that the main line of the railway from Nakuru reached Kampala and then Port Bell.

==Industry==
Uganda Breweries Limited, a subsidiary of East African Breweries, has a brewery and a distillery for Uganda Waragi at Port Bell.

<doc id="491262" wikidata="Q10921475" url="?curid=491262" title="Peace Memorial Day">
<text>Peace Memorial Day (), also known as 228 Memorial Day (), is a public holiday in Taiwan for honoring and mourning the victims and families of the February 28 incident in 1947. Proposals to establish Peace Memorial Day as a holiday began in the early 1990s. It was passed as a national memorial day in 1995 and as an official public holiday in 1997.

A couple years after the Kuomintang government took over the administration of Taiwan from Japan, rampant corruption and heightened inflation led to a general dissatisfaction with the new government. The February 28 incident in 1947 began the Chiang Kai-shek-led government&#x27;s mass killing of civilians, which continued into a period of political persecution known as White Terror. The imposition of martial law became one of the longest in world history.

In February 1987, before martial law was lifted, the 228 Peace Day Association was formed by members of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights and various other human rights groups. On 28 February 1995, 48 years after the 1947 incident, President Lee Teng-hui made a public apology to families of victims and the whole country on behalf of the government. On 23 March 1995, the February 28 Incident Disposition and Compensation Act was passed in the Legislative Yuan, and Peace Memorial Day was officially recognized as an annual memorial day. In 1997, an amendment to the act, proposed by legislator Lin Kuang-hua, to elevate Peace Memorial Day to an official holiday was passed.

<text>Harry Bertoia (March 10, 1915 – November 6, 1978) was an Italian-born American artist, sound art sculptor, and modern furniture designer.

Bertoia was born in San Lorenzo d&#x27;Arzene, Pordenone, Italy. At age 15, given the opportunity to move to Detroit, Harry chose to adventure to America and live with his older brother, Oreste. After learning English and the bus schedule, he enrolled in Cass Technical High School, where he studied art and design and learned the skill of handmade jewelry making ca.1930–1936. At that time, there were three jewelry and metals teachers Louise Green, Mary Davis, and Greta Pack. In 1936 he attended the Art School of the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts, now known as the College for Creative Studies. The following year in 1937 he received a scholarship to study at the Cranbrook Academy of Art where he encountered Walter Gropius, Edmund N. Bacon, Ray and Charles Eames, and Florence Knoll for the first time.

In 2019, the Harry Bertoia Foundation launched a catalogue raisonné project, which seeks to document and research the diverse and extensive artistic practice of the artist. The goal is to provide a comprehensive record and resource of Bertoia&#x27;s work, and will include his painting, graphics (including monotypes), furniture, jewelry, metalwork, sound recordings, and sculpture. An ongoing project, the Harry Bertoia Catalogue Raisonné will be available online, published in stages, and regularly updated to reflect ongoing research. It will be accessible to scholars, educators, collectors, arts professionals, and any member of the public wishing to gain a deeper understanding of Bertoia&#x27;s work.

==Career==
Starting out as a painting student but soon being asked to reopen the metal workshop in 1939, Bertoia taught jewelry design and metal work. Later, as the war effort made metal a rare and very expensive commodity he began to focus his efforts on jewelry making, even designing and creating wedding rings for Ray Eames and Edmund Bacon&#x27;s wife Ruth. When all the metal was taken up by war efforts, he became the graphics instructor. Still at Cranbrook, in 1943 he married Brigitta Valentiner, and then moved to California to work for Charles and Ray at the Molded Plywood Division of the Evans Product Company. Bertoia also learned welding techniques at Santa Monica College and began experimenting with sound sculptures. Bertoia worked there until 1946, then sold his jewelry and monotypes until obtaining work with the Electronics Naval Lab in La Jolla.
In 1950, he was invited to move to Pennsylvania to work with Hans and Florence Knoll. (Florence studied also at Cranbrook.) During this period he designed five wire pieces that became known as the Bertoia Collection for Knoll. Among these was the famous diamond chair, a fluid, sculptural form made from a welded lattice work of steel.

In Bertoia&#x27;s own words, &quot;If you look at these chairs, they are mainly made of air, like sculpture. Space passes right through them.&quot;

The chairs were produced with varying degrees of upholstery over their light grid-work, and they were handmade at first because a suitable mass production process could not be found. Unfortunately, the chair edge utilized two thin wires welded on either side of the mesh seat. This design had been granted a patent to the Eames for the wire chair produced by Herman Miller. Herman Miller eventually won and Bertoia &amp; Knoll redesigned the seat edge, using a thicker, single wire, and grinding down the edge of the seat wires at a smooth angle—the same way the chairs are still produced. Nonetheless, the commercial success enjoyed by Bertoia&#x27;s diamond chair was immediate. It was only in 2005 that Bertoia&#x27;s asymmetrical chaise longue was introduced at the Milan Furniture Fair and sold out immediately.

==Sound sculpture==


In the mid-1950s, the chairs being produced by Knoll sold so well that the lump sum payment arrangement from Knoll allowed Bertoia to devote himself exclusively to sculpture. He ultimately produced over 50 commissioned public sculptures, many of which remain viewable. In the 1960s, he began experimenting with sounding sculptures of tall vertical rods on flat bases. He renovated the old barn into an atypical concert hall and put in about 100 of his favorite &quot;Sonambient&quot; sculptures. Bertoia played the pieces in a number of concerts and even produced a series of eleven albums, all entitled &quot;Sonambient,&quot; of the music made by his art, manipulated by his hands along with the elements of nature. In the late 1990s, his daughter found a large collection of near mint condition original albums stored away on his property in Pennsylvania. These were sold as collector&#x27;s items. In 2015, these Sonambient recordings were re-issued by Important Records as a box set with a booklet of the history and previously unseen photos.

The sound sculptures are also featured on a 1975 record titled &quot;The Sound of Sound Sculpture&quot;. 

Bertoia&#x27;s work can be found in The Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, Massachusetts), the Brooklyn Museum (New York City), the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Dallas Public Library, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington D.C.), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art (Kansas City, Missouri), the Nasher Sculpture Center (Dallas, Texas), the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Reading Public Museum (Reading, Pennsylvania), the Allentown Art Museum, Milwaukee art museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C.), the Vero Beach Museum of Art (Vero Beach, Florida), and the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota).

Bertoia&#x27;s &quot;Sunburst Sculpture&quot; owned by the Joslyn Art Museum was originally installed in the Joslyn&#x27;s Fountain Court. It is now 
located in the lobby of the Milton R. Abrahams Branch of the Omaha Public Library. Lord Palumbo owns several Bertoia works which are on display at Kentuck Knob. Bertoia&#x27;s &quot;Sounding Sculpture&quot; can be found in the plaza of The Aon Center, Chicago&#x27;s fourth-tallest building. Another &quot;Sounding Sculpture&quot;, considerably smaller than the one mentioned above, is featured in the Rose Terrace of the Chicago Botanic Garden, and a third very similar to the piece in Chicago called &quot;Sounding Piece&quot; was until 2003 on display at the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. As explained in October 3, 1995 piece in the weekly &quot;Dear Uncle Ezra&quot; column of the university newspaper:
Dear Uncle Ezra,

What is that sound coming from the Johnson Museum? It&#x27;s a pingy type sound that I guess could be some kind of wind chime but it seems like it&#x27;s coming from the building itself.

— Just wondering
Dear Chiming In,

Well, it almost is coming from the building itself. What you hear is &quot;Sounding Piece&quot;, a sculpture by Harry Bertoia that permanently resides on the sculpture court (outdoor balcony) on the second floor of the Johnson Museum. The chimes sway back and forth on tall rods and &quot;ping&quot; or &quot;gong&quot; into each other (depending on which chime and how hard they collide) when winds move them. It&#x27;s one of my all-time favorites, well worth a visit if you haven&#x27;t seen it. You can go out on to the sculpture court until at least the end of October. Once winter sets in, the chimes are secured so that they won&#x27;t snap in the windy, icy weather.

Uncle Ezra
The sculpture was taken off view after it was damaged in a storm in 2003 . Audiovisual footage of many of Bertoia&#x27;s sound sculptures can be viewed on websites such as YouTube .

==Other work==

Bertoia was the sculptor commissioned to create the Marshall University Memorial Fountain in Huntington, West Virginia, to honor the university&#x27;s football team in the wake of the plane crash that killed them on November 14, 1970. For more information on the disaster, see Marshall University air disaster.

The 1954 Gordon Bunshaft building for Manufacturer&#x27;s Hanover Trust-now JPMorgan Chase (510 Fifth Avenue at West 43rd Street, New York City) included a full building-width, second-floor screen-sculpture by Bertoia. It was dismantled and removed in 2010 by J. P. Morgan Chase.
At some point after 2011, the screen-sculpture was re-installed on the second floor, where it is now on view. Since October 2016, this location is the global flagship for The North Face, a California-based outdoor lifestyle brand.

Bertoia was also commissioned to make a screen sculpture for the Embassy of the United States in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958. The building, located in the Chacao Municipality (former Sucre District), now serves as the headquarters of Venezuela&#x27;s Ministry of the People&#x27;s Power for Tourism, while the embassy was moved to a bigger site in Valle Arriba in 1995. Bertoia&#x27;s sculpture, spanning the entire vertical length of the building, is still in place. 

The &#x27;Golden Sun&#x27; was commissioned in 1967 for The Whiting, an auditorium in Flint, Michigan. Seven feet in diameter, the spherical sculpture consists of 675 gold-plated stainless steel branches and hangs in the building&#x27;s lobby.

==Personal life==
In 1943 Bertoia married fellow Cranbrook student Brigitta Valentiner (daughter of Wilhelm Valentiner, then director of the Detroit Institute of Arts). They had three children; a son, Val, and two daughters, Lesta and Celia. Bertoia died of lung cancer in Barto, Pennsylvania, at the age of 63 on November 6, 1978 and is buried underneath one of the sculptural gongs he created. Brigitta Valentiner, died in 2007, aged 87.

<doc id="491270" wikidata="Q5023960" url="?curid=491270" title="Calshot Spit">
<text>Calshot Spit is a one-mile long sand and shingle bank, near the village of Calshot, located on the southern bank of the open end of Southampton Water, on the south coast of England.

At the end of the spit are Calshot Castle (built by King Henry VIII), an RNLI lifeboat, an NCI station, several slipways, a former Royal Navy and Royal Air Force flying boat station and Calshot Activities Centre. The neck of the spit is owned by New Forest District Council while the end of the spit is owned by the Crown Estate which leases it to Hampshire County Council.

==History==
The castle is a low, circular, stone structure and was armed with large muzzle-loading guns. Its purpose, when it was built in 1539, was to protect access to the important harbour at Southampton from seaborne attack, by France or Spain from the English Channel via the Solent.

For much of its history the spit was low lying and parts of it often underwater at high tide. This changed in 1703 when the great storm of that year washed enough shingle onto the spit to make it a more substantial structure.

Calshot Naval Air Station was originally set up in 1913. Its choice as a location for operating flying boats is clear: the landing area is sheltered by land on the three sides of Southampton Water and by the Isle of Wight, several miles away, on the fourth side. As part of the expansion of the site in 1916 the contractor. Henry Boot &amp; Son (Westminster), built a narrow gauge railway in order to move materials. It was transferred to the air-force in 1919 and ran (with a number of branches) from Eaglehurst camp to north pier at the end of the spit.

In 1929 and 1931, Calshot was the venue for the Schneider Trophy, an international air race for seaplanes.

The railway closed at the end of World War Two when it was found that the wagons had decayed to the point where they were no longer safe to use. One locomotive survives from the railway as &quot;Douglas&quot; on the Talyllyn Railway.

The Spit was transferred to civilian control at the start of the 1960s. A Coastguard tower was added to the end of the spit in 1973. The Coastguard stopped using the castle in 1990.

The site is now the location of Calshot Lifeboat Station operated by the RNLI, yachts and the National Coastwatch Institution. The hangars are home to Calshot Activities Centre and house indoor climbing walls, artificial ski slopes and a velodrome. In 2005 new public toilets were installed in the spit with a design partially inspired by the spit&#x27;s beach huts.

==Shipping==
The spit is a potential navigation hazard for ships entering Southampton Water, and vessels are guided by the Calshot Spit light float. This replaced a Trinity House lightvessel &quot;(LV 78)&quot; that was anchored off the spit and which was, for a while, a static attraction at the Ocean Village marina in Southampton. In November 2010 it was moved a short distance to the Trafalgar dock where, after renovation, it was to be displayed at the &quot;Aeronautica&quot; attraction, due to open in 2015. The plans for Aeronautica came to a halt in January 2012. In December 2019 the ship was relocated to the Solent Sky museum in order to be converted into part of the museum’s cafe. It was built in 1914 by J I Thornycroft shipyard in Southampton and decommissioned in 1978.

LV 50, which was on the Calshot station between 1943 and 1951, was bought by the Royal Northumberland Yacht Club, and remains their club ship to this day.

Personnel from RAF Calshot traveling to and from the spit would sometimes be taken on and off passing Red Funnel ferries in launches.

==Fauna and flora==

Historically the site&#x27;s status as a military base provided a degree of protection for the local flora. The large scale construction of car parks, beach-huts and the importation of topsoil has reduced the range of plants present. &quot;Crambe maritima&quot; (sea kale) still grows on the spit and in the 19th century it was apparently harvested for sale in Southampton.

<text>Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke (6 August 1605 – 28 July 1675) was an English lawyer, writer, parliamentarian, and one of the commissioners of the Great Seal during the Interregnum.

==Early life==

He was the eldest son of Sir James Whitelocke and Elizabeth Bulstrode, and was born on 6 August 1605 at George Croke&#x27;s house in Fleet Street, London. He was baptized on 19 August 1605 at the nearby church of St Dunstan-in-the-West, where his mother&#x27;s parents were married in 1571; his notorious uncle Edmund Whitelocke, being one of the godfathers, announced that the child was to be called Bulstrode. The vicar demurred, but Edmund insisted that he bear his mother&#x27;s name, &quot;Bulstrode or Elizabeth, let them choose which they please&quot;. Bulstrode was educated briefly at Eton College, then at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 8 December 1620.

==Early career==

He left Oxford, without a degree, for the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar in 1626; in 1628 he became treasurer of his Temple. He was fond of field sports and of music, and in 1633/34 he had charge of the music in the great masque &quot;The Triumph of Peace&quot; performed by the Inns of Court before Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France.

==As Lawyer==
He was appointed Recorder of Abingdon (1632–49), of Oxford (1647–49), of Bristol (1651–55), and Counsel for Henley (1632).

==Enters Politics==
He was elected for Stafford in the parliament of 1626. In 1640, he was chosen Member for Great Marlow in the Long Parliament.

He took a prominent part in the proceedings against Strafford, was Chairman of the Committee of Management, and had charge of articles XIX–XXIV of the impeachment. He drew up the Bill for making Parliaments indissoluble except by their own consent, and supported the Grand Remonstrance and the action taken in the House of Commons against the illegal canons; on the militia question, however, he advocated a joint control by King and Parliament.

==His part in the Civil War==
On the outbreak of the English Civil War he took the side of the Parliament, using his influence in the country as Deputy-Lieutenant to prevent the King from raising troops in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.

He was sent to the King at Oxford in 1643 and again in 1644 to negotiate terms, and the secret communications with King Charles on the latter occasion were the foundation of a charge of treason brought later against Whitelocke and Denzil Holles. He was one of the Commissioners at the Treaty of Uxbridge in 1645.

Nevertheless, he opposed the policy of Holles and the Peace Party and the proposed disbanding of the army in 1647, and, although he was one of the lay members of the Assembly of Divines, he repudiated the claims of divine authority put forward by the Presbyterians for their Church, and approved of religious tolerance. He thus gravitated more towards Oliver Cromwell and the Army Party, but he took no part in either the disputes between the Army and Parliament or in the trial of the King. On the establishment of the Commonwealth, though out of sympathy with the government, he was nominated to the Council of State and as a Commissioner of the Parliament&#x27;s new Great Seal (1659–60).

He purportedly urged Cromwell after the Battle of Worcester and again in 1652 to recall the Royal Family. In 1653 he disapproved of the expulsion of the Long Parliament and he was especially marked out for attack by Cromwell in his speech on that occasion.

==Ambassador to Sweden==

Later in the autumn of 1653, and perhaps in consequence, Whitelocke was despatched on a mission to Christina, queen of Sweden, to conclude a treaty of alliance and assure the freedom of the Sound. Retroactively, the diplomatic mission caused him to be considered as the first of the country&#x27;s Ambassadors to Sweden, though at the time this was not a regular or fixed position. He was knighted in 1654.

==His return to Britain==
On his return he resumed his office as Commissioner of the Great Seal, was appointed a Commissioner of the Treasury with a salary of £1000, and was returned to Parliament in 1654 for each of the four constituencies of Bedford, Exeter, Oxford and Buckinghamshire, electing to sit for the latter constituency.

Whitelocke was a learned and sound lawyer. He had hitherto shown himself not unsympathetic to reform, having supported the Bill introducing the use of English into legal proceedings, having drafted a new treason law, and having set on foot some alterations in Chancery procedure. A tract advocating the registering of title deeds is attributed to him. He defeated a bill which sought to exclude lawyers from parliament; and to the sweeping and ill-considered changes in the Court of Chancery proposed by Cromwell and the Council he offered an unbending and honourable resistance, being dismissed in consequence, together with his colleague Sir Thomas Widdrington, on 6 June 1654 from his Commissionership of the Great Seal (see William Lenthall).

However, he still remained on good terms with Cromwell, by whom he was respected; he took part in public business, acted as Cromwell&#x27;s adviser on foreign affairs, negotiated the treaty with Sweden of 1656, and, was elected again to the Parliament of the same year, as Member for Buckinghamshire, he was chairman of the committee which conferred with Cromwell on the subject of the Petition and Advice and urged the protector to assume the title of King. In December 1657 he became a member of Cromwell&#x27;s Other House.

==Under Richard Cromwell==
On Richard Cromwell&#x27;s assumption of the Protectorship, Whitelocke was reappointed a Commissioner of the Great Seal, and had considerable influence during the former&#x27;s short tenure of power. He returned to his place in the Long Parliament on its recall, was appointed a member of the Council of State on 14 May 1659, and became president in August. Subsequently, on the fresh expulsion of the Long Parliament, he was included in the Committee of Safety which superseded the council. He again received the Great Seal into his keeping on 1 November. During the period which immediately preceded the Restoration he endeavoured to oppose George Monck&#x27;s schemes, and desired Charles Fleetwood to forestall him and make terms with King Charles, but in vain.

==End of his career==
On the failure of his plans, he retired to the country and awaited events. Whitelocke&#x27;s career, however, had been marked by moderation and good sense throughout. The necessity of carrying on the government of the country somehow or other had been the chief motive of his adherence to Cromwell rather than any sympathy for a republic or a military dictatorship, and his advice to Cromwell to accept the title of King was doubtless tendered with the object of giving the administration greater stability and of protecting its adherents under the Statute of Henry VII. Nor had he shown himself unduly ambitious or self-seeking in the pursuit of office, and he had proved himself ready to sacrifice high place to the claims of professional honour and duty. These considerations were not without weight with his contemporaries at the Restoration. Accordingly, Whitelocke was not excepted from the Act of Indemnity, and after the payment of various sums to the King and others he was allowed to retain the bulk of his property.

In retirement, he dedicated part of his home Chilton Lodge at Chilton Foliat as a Congregational meeting house, with up to 300 people in attendance. He is commemorated in the placename, Whitelocks Piece, in the village.

==Family==

Whitelocke purchased Greenlands House, Berkshire in 1651. The purchase of this land resulted in Whitelocke owning 3 miles of Thames waterfront below Henley-on-Thames. The site is now the home of Henley Business School, part of the University of Reading. Whitelocke lived at Fawley Court in Buckinghamshire which he had inherited from his father in 1632. After the house was damaged during the Civil War he gave it to his son James and lived henceforth in seclusion at Chilton Lodge near Chilton Foliat in Wiltshire, dying on 28 July 1675, aged 69.

Whitelocke married three times:
# in June 1630, Rebecca, daughter of Thomas Bennet, alderman of London. She was adjudged insane, and died on 9 May 1634. 
#*Their eldest son, James (13 July 1631 – 1701), served in Cromwell&#x27;s guard in Ireland, was chosen colonel of an Oxfordshire militia regiment in 1651, was knighted by the Protector on 6 January 1657, represented Aylesbury in the parliament of 1659.
# on 9 November 1635, Frances (died 1649), daughter of Lord Willoughby of Parham, with whom he had nine children. 
#*His eldest son by his second marriage, William Whitelocke, entertained William III on his journey to London, and was knighted by him on 10 April 1689.
# about 1651, Mary, daughter of one Carleton, and widow of Rowland Wilson, with whom he had four sons and several daughters.

An account of the distribution of his property among these different sons is given in R. H. Whitelocke&#x27;s &quot;Life of Whitelocke&quot;.

<doc id="491272" wikidata="Q313342" url="?curid=491272" title="Emperor Shun">
<text>Emperor Shun () was a legendary leader of ancient China, regarded by some sources as one of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors being the last of the Five Emperors. Tradition holds that he lived sometime between 2294 and 2184 BC. Tradition also holds that those with the surname Hu (胡) are descendants of Emperor Shun. The Duke Hu of Chen, 胡公滿, a descendant of Shun, became the founder of the State of Chen. Later Chen dynasty emperors such as Chen Baxian would also claim descent from Shun.

==Names==
Shun&#x27;s clan name () is Yao (), his lineage name () is Youyu (). His given name was Chonghua (). Shun is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Great Shun&quot; () or as &quot;Yu Shun&quot; or Shun of Yu (), &quot;Yu&quot; being the name of his fief, which he received from Yao.

==Life of Shun==
According to traditional sources, Shun received the mantle of leadership from Emperor Yao at the age of 53, and then died at the age of 100 years. Before his death Shun is recorded as relinquishing his seat of power to Yu (), the founder of the Xia dynasty. Shun&#x27;s capital was located in Puban (), presently located in Shanxi).

Under Emperor Yao, Shun was appointed successively Minister of Instruction, General Regulator and chief of the Four Peaks, and put all affairs in proper order within three years. Yao was so impressed that he appointed Shun as his successor to the throne. Shun wished to decline in favour of someone more virtuous, but eventually assumed Yao&#x27;s duties. It was said that &quot;those who had to try a lawsuit did not go to Danzhu, but to Shun.&quot; Danzhu was the son of Yao.

After ascending to the throne, Shun offered sacrifices to the god Shang Di (), as well as to the hills, rivers, and the host of spirits (). Then he toured the eastern, the southern, the western, and the northern parts of the country; in each place he offered burnt-offering to Heaven at each of the four peaks (Mount Tai, Mount Huang, Mount Hua and Mount Heng), sacrificed to the hills and rivers, set in accord the seasons, months, and days, established uniform measurements of length and capacities, and reinforced ceremonial laws.

Shun divided the land into twelve provinces, raising altars upon twelve hills, and deepening the rivers. Shun dealt with Four Perils: banishing Gonggong to You Prefecture, confining Huan-dou (驩兜) on Mount Chong (宗山), executing or imprisoning Gun a prisoner till his death on Feather Mountain (), and driving the San-Miao into San-Wei. Gun&#x27;s son, Yu (), was subsequently appointed as minister of work(共工) to govern the water and the land. Later, Shun appointed Yu to be General Regulator (Prime Minister). Yu wished to decline in favour of the Minister of Agriculture, or Xie (契), or Gao Yao, but finally accepted upon Shun&#x27;s insistence. Shun then appointed Chui (垂) as the new minister of work (共工). Shun also appointed Yi as Minister of Animal Husbandry to govern the beasts and trees of the land, Bo-yi as Priest of the Ancestral Temple to perform religious ceremonies, Hui as Director of Music, Long as Minister of Communications to counter deceptions and false reports.

According to the &quot;Canon of Shun&quot;, Shun began to reign at the age of 30, reigned with Yao for 30 years, and reigned 50 more years after Yao&#x27;s abdication, then Shun died. The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; state that Yao chose Shun as his heir three years before abdicating the throne to him. Both sources agree that after abdicating, Yao lived for another 28 years in retirement during Shun&#x27;s reign.

In later centuries, Yao and Shun were glorified for their virtue by Confucian philosophers. Shun was particularly renowned for his modesty and filial piety (xiao ).

==Legends==

Sima Qian claimed in Annals of the Five Emperors () that Shun descended from the Yellow Emperor through the latter&#x27;s grandson Emperor Zhuanxu. The Bamboo Annals (048) recorded the name of Shun&#x27;s mother as Wodeng (), and Shun&#x27;s birthplace as Yaoxu (). Wodeng died when Shun was very young. Shun&#x27;s blind father Gusou (, literally: &quot;blind elder&quot;) remarried soon after Shun&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death. Shun&#x27;s stepmother then gave birth to Shun&#x27;s half brother Xiang () and a half-sister (Liènǚ Zhuàn, Ch. 1). Shun&#x27;s stepmother and half brother treated Shun terribly, often forcing Shun to do all the hard work in the family and only giving him the worst food and clothing. Shun&#x27;s father, being blind and elderly, was often ignorant of Shun&#x27;s good deeds and always blamed Shun for everything. Yet, despite these conditions, Shun never complained and always treated his father, his stepmother, and his half brother with kindness and respect.

When he was barely an adult, his stepmother threw him out of the house. Shun was forced to live on his own. Yet, because of his compassionate nature and his natural leadership skills, everywhere he went, people followed him, and he was able to organize the people to be kind to each other and do the best they could. When Shun first went to a village that produced pottery, after less than one year, the pottery became more beautiful than they had ever been. When Shun went to a fishing village, the people there were at first fighting amongst themselves over the fishing grounds, and many people were injured or killed in the fights. Shun taught them how to share and allocate the fishing resources, and soon the village was prospering and all hostilities ceased.

When Emperor Yao became old, he became distressed over the fact that his nine sons were all useless, only knew how to spend their days enjoying themselves with wine and song. Yao asked his ministers, the Four Mountains, to propose a suitable successor. Yao then heard of Shun&#x27;s tales. Wise Yao did not want to simply believe in the tales about Shun, so he decided to test Shun. Yao gave a district to Shun to govern and married his two daughters to him, with a small dowry of a new house and some money.

Though given an office and money, Shun still lived humbly. He continued to work in the fields every day. Shun even managed to convince his two brides, the two princesses, Yao&#x27;s daughters, named Ehuang (Fairy Radiance) and Nüying (Maiden Bloom), who were used to good living, to live humbly and work along the people. However, Shun&#x27;s stepmother and half brother became extremely jealous and conspired to kill Shun. Once Shun&#x27;s half brother Xiang lit a barn on fire, and convinced Shun to climb onto the roof to put the fire out, but then Xiang took away the ladder, trapping Shun on the burning roof. Shun skilfully made a parachute out of his hat and cloth and jumped down in safety. Another time, Xiang and his mother conspired to get Shun drunk and then throw him into a dried-up well and then bury him with rocks and dirt. Shun&#x27;s half-sister, never approving of her mother and brother&#x27;s schemes, told Shun&#x27;s wives about the scheme. Shun thus prepared himself. Shun pretended to get drunk, and when he was thrown into the well, he had already a tunnel pre-dug to escape to the surface. Thus, Shun survived many attempts on his life. Yet, he never blamed his stepmother or his half brother, and forgave them every time.

Eventually, Shun&#x27;s stepmother and half brother repented their past wrongs. Shun wholeheartedly forgave them both, and even helped Xiang get an office. Shun also managed to influence Emperor Yao&#x27;s 9 worthless sons into becoming useful contributing members of society.

Emperor Yao was very impressed by all of Shun&#x27;s achievements, and thus chose Shun as his successor and put him on the throne in the year of Jiwei (). Yao&#x27;s capital was in Ji () which in modern times is also in Shanxi province.

Shun is also renowned as the originator of the music called Dashao (), a symphony of nine Chinese musical instruments.

In the last year of Shun&#x27;s reign, Shun decided to tour the country. But unfortunately, he died suddenly of an illness on the journey near the Xiang River. Both his wives rushed from home to his body, and wept by the river for days. Their tears turned into blood and stained the reeds by the river. From that day on, the bamboo of that region became red-spotted, which explains the origin of spotted bamboo. Then overcome by grief, both women threw themselves into the river and drowned.

Shun considered his son, Shangjun (), as unworthy and picked Yu, the tamer of floods, as his heir.

== Descendants ==
According to tradition, the Hu people are believed to be descendants of Emperor Shun. Gui Man, a direct descendant of Shun, became known as Chen Hugong or Duke Hu of Chen, meaning Duke Hu who founded the State of Chen. Later Chen dynasty emperors such as Chen Baxian would also claim descent from Shun.

&quot;Hồ&quot; is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of 胡 &quot;Hú&quot;. Hồ Quý Ly, the founder of the Hồ dynasty, also claimed descent from Duke Hu of Chen and thereby direct descent from Shun. The Hồ family in Vietnam originated from China&#x27;s Zhejiang province around the 900s. 

Tian (田) and Yuan (袁) also claim descent from the State of Chen.

==Alternative biography==

It is thought by some scholars that Mencius asserted &quot;Shun was an Eastern barbarian; he was born in Chu Feng, moved to Fu Hsia, and died in Ming T&#x27;iao and that emperor Yao came to his field&#x27;s with oxs and married his daughters to him and appointed him and that he did not reign as emperor until after yao died because they cannot be two rulers. Additionally, the Bamboo Annals and Han Fei paint a very different picture of Shun. Both the Annals and the book Han Feizi stated that Shun overthrew Yao and left him in prison to die. Danzhu, Yao&#x27;s son and rightful heir, was banished and later defeated in battle. In addition, Han Fei stated that Yu then rebelled and banished Shun. This account was referenced in Li Bai&#x27;s poem &quot;Distant Parting&quot; (遠別離).

Han Fei also mentioned that Shun personally settled land and water disputes among farmers and fishermen by cohabitating with them.

<text>Emperor Yao (; traditionally c. 2356 – 2255 BCE) was a legendary Chinese ruler, according to various sources, one of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.

==Ancestry and early life==
Yao&#x27;s ancestral name is Yi Qi () or Qi (), clan name is Taotang (), given name is Fangxun (), as the second son to Emperor Ku and Qingdu (). He is also known as Tang Yao ().

Yao&#x27;s mother has been worshipped as the goddess Yao-mu (堯母).

==Legends==

According to the legend, Yao became the ruler at 20 and died at 99 when he passed his throne to Shun the Great, to whom he had given his two daughters in marriage. According to the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, Yao abdicated his throne to Shun in his 73rd year of reign, and continued to live during Shun&#x27;s reign for another 28 years.

It was during the reign of Emperor Yao that the Great Flood began, a flood so vast that no part of Yao&#x27;s territory was spared, and both the Yellow River and the Yangtze valleys flooded. The alleged nature of the flood is shown in the following quote:

According to both historical and mythological sources, the flooding continued relentlessly. Yao sought to find someone who could control the flood, and turned for advice to his special adviser, or advisers, the Four Mountains (四嶽, &quot;Sìyuè&quot;); who, after deliberation, gave Emperor Yao some advice which he did not especially welcome. Upon the insistence of Four Mountains, and over Yao&#x27;s initial hesitation, the person Yao finally consented to appoint in charge of controlling the flood was Gun, the Prince of Chong, who was a distant relative of Yao&#x27;s through common descent from the Yellow Emperor.

Even after nine years of the efforts of Gun, the flood continued to rage on, leading to the increase of all sorts of social disorders. The administration of the empire was becoming increasingly difficult; so, accordingly, at this point, Yao offered to resign the throne in favor of his special adviser(s), Four Mountains: however, Four Mountains declined, and instead recommended Shun – another distant relative to Yao through the Yellow Emperor; but one who was living in obscurity, despite his royal lineage.

Yao proceeded to put Shun through a series of tests, beginning with marrying his two daughters to Shun and ending by sending him down from the mountains to the plains below where Shun had to face fierce winds, thunder, and rain. After passing all of Yao&#x27;s tests, not the least of which being establishing and continuing a state of marital harmony together with Yao&#x27;s two daughters, Shun took on administrative responsibilities as co-emperor. Among these responsibilities, Shun had to deal with the Great Flood and its associated disruptions, especially in light of the fact that Yao&#x27;s reluctant decision to appoint Gun to handle the problem had failed to fix the situation, despite having been working on it for the previous nine years. Shun took steps over the next four years to reorganize the empire, in such a way as to solve immediate problems and to put the imperial authority in a better position to deal with the flood and its effects.

==Bamboo Annals==
The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; represent Yao as having banished prince Danzhu to Danshui in his 58th year of reign. They add that following Yao&#x27;s abdication in favor of Shun, Danzhu kept away from Shun, and that following the death of Yao, &quot;Shun tried to yield the throne to him, but in vain.&quot;

However, an alternative account found elsewhere in the Annals offers a different story. It holds that Shun dethroned and imprisoned Yao, then raised Danzhu to the throne for a short time before seizing it himself.

==Legacy==

Often extolled as the morally perfect and intelligent sage-king, Yao&#x27;s benevolence and diligence served as a model to future Chinese monarchs and emperors. Early Chinese accounts often speak of Yao, Shun and Yu the Great as historical figures, and contemporary historians believed they may represent leader-chiefs of allied tribes who established a unified and hierarchical system of government in a transition period to the patriarchal feudal society. In the &quot;Classic of History&quot;, one of the &quot;Five Classics&quot;, the initial chapters deal with Yao, Shun and Yu.

Of his many contributions, Yao is said to have invented the game of Weiqi (Go), reportedly to favorably influence his vicious playboy son Danzhu. After the customary three-year mourning period after Yao&#x27;s death, Shun named Danzhu as the ruler but the people only recognized Shun as the rightful heir.

==Astronomical observations==
According to some Chinese classic documents such as Yao Dian (Document of Yao) in Shang Shu (Book of Documents), and Wudibenji (Records for the Five Kings) in the &quot;Shiji&quot; (Historic Records), Yao assigned astronomic officers to observe celestial phenomena such as the sunrise, sunset, and the rising of the evening stars. This was done in order to make a solar and lunar calendar with 366 days for a year, also providing for the leap month.

Some recent archaeological work at Taosi, an ancient site in Shanxi, dating to 2300 BCE – 1900 BCE, may have provided some evidence for this. A sort of an ancient observatory – the oldest in East Asia – was found at Taosi that seems to coincide with the ancient records.

Some Chinese archaeologists believe that Taosi was the site of a state called Tang () conquered by Emperor Yao and made to be his capital.

The structure consists of an outer semi-ring-shaped path, and a semi-round rammed-earth platform with a diameter of about 60 m; it was discovered in 2003–2004.

==Dynastic succession==
Yao was claimed to be the ancestor of the Han dynasty Emperor Liu Bang. Other important noble families have also claimed descent through Yellow Emperor.

<text>Henry Scott Tuke (12 June 1858 – 13 March 1929) was an English artist. His most notable work was in the Impressionist style and he is best known for his paintings of nude boys and young men.

Trained at the Slade School of Art under Alphonse Legros and Sir Edward Poynter, Tuke developed a close relationship with the Newlyn School of painters, his work being exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, of which he became a Full Member. In addition to his achievements as a figurative painter, he was an established maritime artist and produced many portraits of sailing ships. He was highly prolific, with over 1,300 works listed and more being discovered.

==Early life==

Tuke was born at Lawrence Street, York, into the prominent Quaker Tuke family. His brother William Samuel Tuke was born two years earlier in 1856. His father, Daniel Hack Tuke, a well-known medical doctor specialising in psychiatry, was a campaigner for humane treatment of the insane. His great-great-grandfather William Tuke had founded the Retreat at York, one of the first modern insane asylums, in 1796. His great-grandfather Henry Tuke, grandfather Samuel Tuke and uncle James Hack Tuke were also well-known social activists. The Tuke family&#x27;s ancestry can be traced back to Sir Brian Tuke, who served as an adviser to King Henry VIII of England (replacing Sir Thomas More).

In 1859, the family moved to Falmouth in Cornwall where it was hoped the warmer climate would benefit Tuke&#x27;s father, Daniel, who had developed symptoms of tuberculosis. Daniel survived there and lived on until he was 68. He established a small doctor&#x27;s practice in his house in Wood Lane. His sister, Maria Tuke Sainsbury (1861–1947)—who wrote a biography of her brother after his death—was born there. William went on to study medicine but Henry, or Harry as he was called by the family, showed no interest in the profession.

Tuke was encouraged to draw and paint from an early age. Tuke and his siblings were taught by a governess at home. Maria described their childhood in Falmouth as &quot;a very happy and healthy one&quot; and the long summer days spent on the beach and swimming in the sea had a lasting effect on Tuke; other enduring memories were the firm friendships the young Tuke formed.

In 1874, Tuke moved to London, where he enrolled in the Slade School of Art. It was in Falmouth that the young Tuke had been introduced to the pleasures of nude sea bathing, a habit he continued into old age. After graduating he travelled to Italy in 1880, and from 1881 to 1883 he lived in Paris, where he studied with the French history painter Jean-Paul Laurens and met the American painter John Singer Sargent (who was also a painter of male nudes, although this was little known in his lifetime).

During the 1880s, Tuke also met Oscar Wilde and other prominent poets and writers such as John Addington Symonds, most of whom were homosexual (then usually called Uranian) and who celebrated the adolescent male. He wrote a &quot;sonnet to youth&quot; which was published anonymously in &quot;The Artist&quot;, and also contributed an essay to &quot;The Studio&quot;.

==Newlyn School==

In 1883, Tuke returned to Britain and moved to Newlyn, Cornwall joining a small colony of artists including Walter Langley, Albert Chevallier Tayler and Thomas Cooper Gotch. These painters, and others, became known as the Newlyn School. He worked from Rose Cottage at Tregadgwith Farm, Cornwall at the head of the Lamorna valley.

In Newlyn, in 1884, Tuke completed his first painting of boys in boats. Called &quot;Summertime&quot;, it depicts two local boys, John Wesley Kitching and John Cotton, in a punt called &quot;Little Argo&quot;. Tuke&#x27;s style was more impressionistic than that of the other Newlyn painters and he only stayed a short time. However, he remained close friends with many of the artists until his death.
==Falmouth==
Tuke painted oil studies of young male nudes during a tour of Italy in his early twenties in 1881, but the theme did not become central to his work until after 1885, when he had moved back to Falmouth, then still a secluded part of Cornwall and a part of the country with a very mild climate that was more agreeable for nude bathing. There Tuke focused on maritime scenes and portraits, which showed boys and young men bathing, fishing and sunbathing on sunny beaches.

He settled at Swanpool and bought a fishing boat for £40, &#x27;Julie of Nantes&#x27;, and converted it into a floating studio and living quarters. He rented two rooms in Pennance Cottage, situated between Pennance Point and Swanpool Beach.

The cottage remained Tuke&#x27;s permanent base until his death, although he often lived aboard boats. Here he could indulge his passion for painting boys. His early models were brought down from London but he soon befriended some of the local fishermen and swimmers in Falmouth who became his close friends and models. These included Edward John &quot;Johnny&quot; Jackett (1878–1935), Charlie Mitchell (1885–1957), who looked after Tuke&#x27;s boats, Willie Sainsbury, Tuke&#x27;s eldest nephew, Leo Marshall, Georgie and Richard Fouracre (sons of his housekeeper), George Williams – younger son of close neighbours, Maurice Clift – nephew of a family friend, Ainsley Marks, Jack Rolling (in some sources misspelt &quot;Rowling&quot;), Freddy Hall, Bert White and Harry Cleave.

Owing to Tuke&#x27;s habit of interchanging heads and bodies of his models in his paintings, it is often not possible to identify each figure exactly. All of Tuke&#x27;s regular models were eventually called up during the First World War, and some did not return, including Maurice Clift (a model for &quot;August Blue&quot;) who was killed in France.

Tuke established an art gallery in Falmouth with William Ayerst Ingram as a commercial outlet mainly for their own paintings.

He would often commute to London as Falmouth was well served with a railway service and he was not therefore isolated from the London art scene. He produced numerous portraits of society figures, local officials and members of the Tuke family circle. He also painted many more saleable landscapes and was well regarded as a painter of ships in sail. Henry Scott Tuke was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1900 and Royal Academician in 1914.

==Style==
Tuke favoured rough, visible brush strokes, at a time when a smooth, polished finish was favoured by fashionable painters and critics. He had a strong sense of colour and excelled in the depiction of natural light, particularly the soft, fragile sunlight of the English summer. Although Tuke often finished paintings in the studio, photographic evidence shows that he worked mainly in the open air, which accounts for their freshness of colour and the realistic effects of sunlight reflected by the sea and on the naked flesh of his models.

In his early paintings, Tuke placed his male nudes in mythological contexts, but the critics found these works to be rather formal, lifeless and flaccid. From the 1890s, Tuke abandoned mythological themes and began to paint local boys fishing, sailing, swimming and diving, and also began to paint in a more naturalistic style. His handling of paint became freer, and he began using bold, fresh colour. One of his best-known paintings from this period is &quot;August Blue&quot; (1893–94; Tate, London), a study of four mostly nude youths bathing from a boat. The Looe artist, Lindsay Symington (1872–1942), modelled for the blonde boy holding onto the boat in the water; though not a regular model, Symington was a good friend of Tuke, the latter often visiting the Symington family home, Pixies&#x27; Holt, at Dartmeet. Tuke painted some female nudes but these were not as successful as his male nude paintings.

Tuke&#x27;s paintings of nude youths are never explicitly sexual. The models&#x27; genitals are almost never shown, they are almost never in physical contact with each other, and there is never any suggestion of overt sexuality. Most of the paintings have the nude models standing or crouching on the beach facing out to sea, so only the back view is displayed.
Tuke is also regarded as an important maritime artist. Over the years, he painted many pictures of the majestic sailing ships, mainly in watercolour, that were common until the 1930s. Tuke was often fascinated with the beauty of a fully rigged ship, and since his childhood could draw them from memory. His decision to return to Falmouth in 1885 was, in part, influenced by the constant presence of the ships there.

Tuke enjoyed a considerable reputation, and he earned enough money from his paintings to enable him to travel abroad and he painted in France, Italy and the West Indies. In 1900 a banquet was held in his honour at the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society. He was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts in 1914.

Major examples of his male nudes were purchased by major art galleries including &quot;The Bathers&quot; at Leeds Art Gallery in 1890 and &quot;August Blue&quot; at the Tate, London in 1894. But he was also well known as a portraitist, and maintained a London studio to work on his commissions. Among his best known portraits is that of soldier and writer T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;).

==Death==

In later life Tuke was in poor health for many years. He died in Falmouth in 1929 and was buried in a Falmouth cemetery close to his home. He kept a detailed diary all his life but only two volumes survived after his death, which have since been published. He also kept a detailed artist&#x27;s Register, which survives and has been published by the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society in Falmouth.

==Legacy==

After his death, Tuke&#x27;s reputation faded, and he was largely forgotten until the 1970s, when he was rediscovered by the first generation of openly gay artists and art collectors. He has since become something of a cult figure in gay cultural circles, with lavish editions of his paintings published and his works fetching high prices at auctions.

Elton John is a keen collector of Tuke&#x27;s works and in 2008 lent eleven of his own pieces, including works in oil, pastel and watercolour, for an exhibition in Falmouth.

==Commemoration==
The student halls of residence at University College Falmouth are named after Tuke, a tribute to him as both an artist, and a famous resident of the town. At the time they were built and named, the school was known as the Falmouth College of Arts. Also in Falmouth is a collection of 279 of Tuke&#x27;s works belonging to the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, the largest such collection in public ownership. The bulk were donated by a single collector in the 1960s, but the Society maintains a policy of adding to the collection.

==Exhibitions and publications==
In 2008, to mark the 150th anniversary of Tuke&#x27;s birth, there were three exhibitions of his work:
*3 May 2008 – 12 July 2008: &quot;Catching the light: the sunshine paintings of Henry Scott Tuke&quot;.
*6 September 2008 – 27 September 2008: &quot;Tall ships&quot;.
*10 May – 12 July 2008: &quot;Catching the Light: A Retrospective of Henry Scott Tuke&quot;, Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro
*7 June – 12 July 2008: &quot;A Hidden Treasure Revealed: A selection of the works on paper by Henry Scott Tuke from the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society&quot;, the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro
*21 July – 28 August 2008: &quot;Catching the Light: The Art of Henry Scott Tuke&quot; at the Fine Art Society, New Bond Street, London
*7 June - 12 September 2021 Watts Gallery https://www.wattsgallery.org.uk/whats-on/henry-scott-tuke/ 

== Collections ==
H.S. Tuke&#x27;s works are held in a number of galleries and museums including Tate, Hunterian Art Gallery, Grundy Art Gallery, Walker Art Gallery, Leamington Spa Art Gallery &amp; Museum, Bodleian Libraries, Royal Academy of Arts, Guildhall Art Gallery.

The papers of H.S. Tuke and Thomas Cooper Gotch are also held in the Tate Archive collections (TGA 9019). The papers in the Tate Archive provide context in which Tuke worked, not just the locations of his paintings and the relationships with his models, but his artistic allegiances such as his deep friendship with the painter Thomas Cooper Gotch.
