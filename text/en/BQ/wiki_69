<text>Cleromancy is a form of sortition (casting of ) in which an outcome is determined by means that normally would be considered random, such as the rolling of dice (astragalomancy), but that are sometimes believed to reveal the will of a deity.

==In classical civilization==
In ancient Rome fortunes were told through the casting of lots or &quot;sortes&quot;.

==In Judaic and Christian tradition==
Casting of lots (, ) is mentioned 47 times in the Bible. Some examples in the Hebrew Bible of the casting of lots as a means of determining God&#x27;s will:
* In the Book of Leviticus , God commanded Moses, &quot;And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the , and the other lot for the scapegoat.&quot; One goat will be sacrificed as a sin offering, while the scapegoat is loaded up with the sins of the people and sent into the wilderness.
* According to Numbers , Moses allocated territory to the tribes of Israel according to each tribe&#x27;s male population and by lot.
* In Joshua 7:14, a guilty party (Achan) is found by lot.
* In the Book of Joshua , Joshua says, &quot;Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the our God.&quot; The Hebrews took this action to know God&#x27;s will as to the dividing of the land between the seven tribes of Israel who had not yet &quot;received their inheritance&quot; (Joshua 18:2).
* In the First Book of Samuel , lots are used to determine that it was Jonathan, Saul&#x27;s son, who broke the oath that Saul made, &quot;Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies&quot; (1 Samuel 14:24).
* In the Book of Jonah , the desperate sailors cast lots to see whose god was responsible for creating the storm: &quot;Then the sailors said to each other, &#x27;Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity.&#x27; They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.&quot;

Other places in the Hebrew Bible relevant to divination include:
* Book of Proverbs : &quot;The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from Yahweh&quot; and : &quot;The lot settles disputes, and keeps strong ones apart.&quot;
* Book of Leviticus KJV &quot;... neither shall you practice enchantment, nor observe times.&quot; The original Hebrew word for enchantment, as found in &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot;, is pronounced &quot;naw-khash&quot;&#x27;. The translation given by Strong&#x27;s is &quot;to practice divination, divine, observe signs, learn by experience, diligently observe, practice fortunetelling, take as an omen&quot;; and &quot;1. to practice divination 2. to observe the signs or omens&quot;. &quot;Times&quot; in the original Hebrew is pronounced aw-nan&#x27;. Its translation in Strong&#x27;s is &quot;to make appear, produce, bring (clouds), to practise soothsaying, conjure;&quot; and &quot;1. to observe times, practice soothsaying or spiritism or magic or augury or witchcraft 2. soothsayer, enchanter, sorceress, diviner, fortune-teller, barbarian...&quot;. In the Hebrew-Interlinear Bible, the verse reads, &quot;not you shall augur and not you shall consult cloud&quot;.
* Deuteronomy &quot;let no one be found among you who &quot;[qasam qesem]&quot;, performs &quot;[onan]&quot;, &quot;[nahash]&quot;, or &quot;[kashaph]&quot;. &quot;qasam qesem&quot; literally means &quot;distributes distributions&quot;, and may possibly refer to cleromancy. &quot;Kashaph&quot; seems to mean &quot;mutter&quot;, although the Septuagint renders the same phrase as &quot;pharmakia&quot; (&quot;poison&quot;), so it may refer to magic potions.
* In the Book of Esther, Haman casts lots to decide the date on which to exterminate the Jews of Shushan; the Jewish festival of Purim commemorates the subsequent chain of events.
* In I Chronicles guard duties are assigned by lot.
* To Christian doctrine, perhaps the most significant ancient Hebrew mention of lots occurs in the Book of Psalms, &quot;They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.&quot; This came to be regarded as a prophecy connecting that psalm and the one that follows to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, since all four gospels (for example, John ) tell of the Roman soldiers at Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion casting lots to see who would take possession of his clothing. That final act of profanation became the central theme of &quot;The Robe&quot;, a 1953 film starring Richard Burton.

A notable example in the New Testament occurs in the Acts of the Apostles where the eleven remaining apostles cast lots to determine whether to select Matthias, or Barsabbas (surnamed Justus) to replace Judas.

The Eastern Orthodox Church still occasionally uses this method of selection. In 1917, Metropolitan Tikhon became Patriarch of Moscow by the drawing of lots. The Coptic Orthodox Church uses drawing lots to choose the Coptic pope, most recently done in November 2012 to choose Pope Tawadros II. German Pietist Christians in the 18th century often followed the New Testament precedent of drawing lots to determine the will of God. They often did so by selecting a random Bible passage. The most extensive use of drawing of lots in the Pietist tradition may have come with Count von Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren of Herrnhut, who drew lots for many purposes, including selection of church sites, approval of missionaries, the election of bishops, and many others. This practice was greatly curtailed after the General Synod of the worldwide Moravian Unity in 1818 and finally discontinued in the 1880s. Many Amish customarily select ordinary preachers by lot. (Note that the Greek word for &quot;lot&quot; (&quot;kleros&quot;) serves as the etymological root for English words like &quot;cleric&quot; and &quot;clergy&quot; as well as for &quot;cleromancy&quot;.)

==In Germania==

Tacitus, in Chapter X of his &quot;Germania&quot; (circa 98 AD), describes casting lots as a practice used by the Germanic tribes. He states:
&quot;To divination and casting of lots, they pay attention beyond any other people. Their method of casting lots is a simple one: they cut a branch from a fruit-bearing tree and divide it into small pieces which they mark with certain distinctive signs and scatter at random onto a white cloth. Then, the priest of the community if the lots are consulted publicly, or the father of the family if it is done privately, after invoking the gods and with eyes raised to heaven, picks up three pieces, one at a time, and interprets them according to the signs previously marked upon them.&quot;
In the ninth century Anskar, a Frankish missionary and later bishop of Hamburg-Bremen, observed the same practice several times in the decision-making process of the Danish peoples. In this version, the chips were believed to determine the support or otherwise of gods, whether Christian or Norse, for a course of action or act. For example, in one case a Swedish man feared he had offended a god and asked a soothsayer to cast lots to find out which god. The soothsayer determined that the Christian god had taken offence; the Swede later found a book that his son had stolen from Bishop Gautbert in his house.

==In Asian culture==
In ancient China, and especially in Chinese folk religion, various means of divination through random means are employed, such as &quot;qiúqiān&quot; (求簽). In Japan, omikuji is one form of drawing lots.

I Ching divination, which dates from early China, has played a major role in Chinese culture and philosophy for more than two thousand years. The I Ching tradition descended in part from the oracle bone divination system that was used by rulers in the Shang dynasty, and grew over time into a rich literary wisdom tradition that was closely tied to the philosophy of yin and yang. I Ching practice is widespread throughout East Asia, and commonly involves the use of coins or (traditionally) sticks of yarrow.

In South India, the custom of ritualistically tossing sea shells (sozhi) and interpreting the results based on the positions of the shells is prevalent, predominantly in the state of Kerala.

==In West African culture==
In Yoruba and Yoruba-inspired religions, babalawos use variations on a common type of cleromancy called &quot;Ifá divination&quot;. Ifá divination is performed by &quot;pounding ikin&quot;—transferring consecrated oil palm kernels from one hand to another to create a pattern of eight to sixteen marks called &quot;Odù&quot; onto a tray of &quot;iyerosun&quot;, or consecrated termite dust from the Irosun tree. The casting itself is called &quot;Dafá&quot; in Yoruba language speaking areas in West Africa. Similar to I Ching, this form of divination forms a binary-like series of eight broken or unbroken pairs. This allows for 256 combinations, each of which references sets of tonal poems that contain a structure that includes various issues, problems and adversities and the prescriptions of offerings to correct them.

==In M&#x27;ikmaq tradition==

The game of Waltes is a form of cleromancy practiced by traditional Mi&#x27;kmaq and preserved since colonial potlache law, the Indian Act and residential schools in Canada. It is played with a bowl, six bone dice, and a counting stick. Three sticks are grandmothers and one the grandfather.

<text>Chuncheon (; ; literally &quot;spring river&quot;), formerly romanized as Ch&#x27;unch&#x27;ŏn, is the capital of Gangwon Province, South Korea. The city lies in the north of the country, located in a basin formed by the Soyang River and Han River.

==History==

The area now occupied by the city was first settled several thousands of years ago, in prehistoric times, as demonstrated by stone-age archaeological evidence in the collections of Chuncheon National Museum and Hallym University Museum. In 637 AD the city was called &quot;Usooju&quot;. In 757 AD it was renamed &quot;Saku&quot; and again in 940 AD as &quot;Chunju&quot; () before receiving its current name in 1413. In 1896, Chuncheon became the capital city of Gangwon province. The city was largely destroyed during the Korean War in the Battle of Chuncheon.

<doc id="502392" wikidata="Q542297" url="?curid=502392" title="Blaze Starr">
<text>Blaze Starr (born Fannie Belle Fleming; April 10, 1932 – June 15, 2015) was an American stripper and burlesque star. Her vivacious presence and inventive use of stage props earned her the nickname &quot;The Hottest Blaze in Burlesque&quot;. She was also known for her affair with Louisiana Governor Earl Kemp Long. Based on her memoir &quot;Blaze Starr! My Life as Told to Huey Perry&quot; (published in 1974), the 1989 film &quot;Blaze&quot; told the story of that affair starring Paul Newman as Long and Lolita Davidovich as Starr, with Starr herself acting in a cameo role and as a consultant.

==Early life==
Starr was born on April 10, 1932, in rural Wayne County, West Virginia, along Twelvepole Creek, (also spelled Twelve Pole Creek) the second eldest of 11 siblings born to Lora (née Evans) and Goodlow Fleming.

Reared in the Newground Hollow (also spelled New Ground Hollow) area of Wilsondale, West Virginia, she left home at either age 14 or 15, claiming to have suffered a gang rape during her teenage years. She first moved to Logan, West Virginia, working as a carhop, and then from there to Washington D.C., where, according to her autobiography, she was discovered by a promoter while she was employed in a doughnut shop.

She recalled:

Snyder became Fleming&#x27;s first manager, encouraged her to start stripping, and gave her the stage name Blaze Starr.

==Career==
Starr moved to Baltimore, where she began performing at the Two O&#x27;Clock Club nightclub in 1950. She eventually became its headliner. She rose to national renown after she was profiled in a February 1954 &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine article, &quot;B-Belles of Burlesque: You Get Strip Tease With Your Beer in Baltimore&quot;. The Two O&#x27;Clock Club remained her home base, but she began to travel and perform in clubs throughout the country.

Starr&#x27;s striking red hair, voluptuous figure and on-stage enthusiasm were a large part of her appeal. The theatrical flourishes and unique gimmicks she used in her stage show went beyond established burlesque routines like the fan dance and balloon dance. She often performed with dangerous cats, including a baby black panther.

Her trademark routine was &quot;the exploding couch&quot;. As she explained in 1989, &quot;I had finally got my gimmick, a comedy thing where I&#x27;m supposed to be getting so worked up that I stretch out on the couch, and — when I push a secret button — smoke starts coming out from like between my legs. Then a fan and a floodlight come on, and you see all these red silk streamers blowing, shaped just like flames, so it looked like the couch had just burst into fire.&quot;

Blaze was arrested more than once. The first time was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for lewdness, by a young police officer, Frank Rizzo, who would later become that city&#x27;s police commissioner and mayor. Another time was in New Orleans.

In 1968, Starr bought the Two O&#x27;Clock Club on The Block in Baltimore, Maryland, which at the time was valued at 65,000 dollars. She continued to perform in the club. In the early 1980s, Starr made an appearance at the Mitchell Brothers&#x27; O&#x27;Farrell Theatre in San Francisco.

==Relationship with Louisiana Governor Earl Long==

In the late 1950s, while briefly working at the Sho-Bar on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Starr began a long-term affair with then-governor Earl Long. Starr was in the process of divorcing her husband, club owner Carroll Glorioso, and Long was married to the state&#x27;s first lady, known colloquially as &quot;Miz Blanche&quot;.

==Media appearances==
Two of Starr&#x27;s performances, including the combustible sofa, are among the burlesque routines featured in the 1956 compilation film &quot;Buxom Beautease&quot;, produced and directed by Irving Klaw. Director Doris Wishman&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;Blaze Starr Goes Nudist,&quot; a nudie-sexploitation film, features Starr&#x27;s one lead movie role. As the title suggests, she plays herself. The film is also known as &quot;Blaze Starr Goes Back to Nature&quot;, &quot;Blaze Starr Goes Wild&quot;, &quot;Blaze Starr the Original&quot;, and &quot;Busting Out.&quot;

Diane Arbus photographed Starr in 1964. The photo &quot;Blaze Starr at home&quot; was included in the book and traveling exhibit &quot;Diane Arbus: Family Albums&quot;.

The 1989 movie &quot;Blaze&quot; recounted the story of her and Long&#x27;s relationship. The film was directed by Ron Shelton, adapted by him from Starr&#x27;s memoir &quot;Blaze Starr: My Life as Told to Huey Perry&quot; (1974), and starred Lolita Davidovich as Starr and Paul Newman as Long. Starr herself appeared in a cameo role and acted as consultant, earning four percent of the film&#x27;s profits.

Some of Starr&#x27;s costumes and other memorabilia have been displayed at the Museum of Sex in New York City and the Burlesque Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.

==Retirement and personal life==
Journalist Frank Lovece wrote in 1989 that &quot;Starr... gave up stripping six years ago to become a gemologist and make and sell jewelry. Each holiday season, at the Carrolltowne Mall here in the Baltimore suburbs, she is a local celebrity selling earrings, bracelets and necklaces fashioned from the gemstones and crystals she collects the rest of the year.&quot;

Starr was a first cousin of singer Molly O&#x27;Day.

==Death==
Starr died June 15, 2015, either at her home in Wilsondale, West Virginia, or at a hospital in nearby Williamson (sources vary). She was 83 years old. She had been worried about the health of her dog, whom she adopted as a stray. One of her sisters claimed the stress, along with a &quot;severe heart condition&quot;, killed her. Her dog died hours later.

<doc id="502409" wikidata="Q16991635" url="?curid=502409" title="Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council">
<text>Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, also known as Dudley Council, is the local authority for the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley in the West Midlands, England. The town of Dudley had been a borough since the thirteenth century, being reformed on numerous occasions. Since 1974 the council has been a metropolitan borough council. It provides the majority of local government services in the borough. The council has been a member of the West Midlands Combined Authority since 2016.

The council has been under no overall control since the 2024 election, with the leader of the council being a Conservative. It is based at Dudley Council House.

== History ==
The town of Dudley had been a seigneurial borough from the thirteenth century, under the control of the lord of the manor. More modern forms of local government for the town began in 1791 when a body of improvement commissioners was established to pave, light and clean the streets, and supply water. The commissioners were replaced in 1853 with an elected local board.

The town was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1865, governed by a body formally called the &quot;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Dudley&quot;, generally known as the corporation, town council or borough council. The old local board&#x27;s functions passed to the new borough council, which also replaced the ancient borough corporation.

When elected county councils were established in 1889, Dudley was considered large enough to provide its own county-level functions, and so it was made a county borough, independent from Worcestershire County Council, whilst remaining part of the geographical county of Worcestershire (despite being an exclave detached from the rest of the county). The County Borough of Dudley was enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1966 when it absorbed the majority of the abolished urban districts of Brierley Hill, Coseley and Sedgeley, alongside boundary adjustments with several other neighbours. As part of the 1966 reforms the borough was transferred to the geographical county of Staffordshire.

The modern metropolitan borough and its council were established in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, as one of seven boroughs in the new metropolitan county of the West Midlands. The new borough covered the combined area of the old county borough of Dudley plus the municipal boroughs of Halesowen and Stourbridge (the latter having absorbed the main part of the abolished Amblecote Urban District in the 1966 reforms). The enlarged district was named Dudley, and the borough status previously held by the county borough passed to the new district on its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Dudley&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to at least the sixteenth century.

From 1974 until 1986 the council was a lower-tier authority, with upper-tier functions provided by the West Midlands County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986 and its functions passed to the county&#x27;s seven borough councils, including Dudley, with some services provided through joint committees.

Since 2016 the council has been a member of the West Midlands Combined Authority, which has been led by the directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands since 2017. The combined authority provides strategic leadership and co-ordination for certain functions across the county, but Dudley Council continues to be responsible for most local government functions.

The council bid for the borough to be awarded city status in 2011 and again in 2021, but was unsuccessful on both occasions.

== Governance ==
Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council provides both county-level and district-level services, with some functions across the West Midlands provided via joint committees with the other West Midlands authorities, overseen by the combined authority and mayor. There are no civil parishes in the borough, which is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2024.

Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===

The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Dudley. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1998 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was Conservative 34, Labour 34, Liberal Democrats 3 and Independent 1. Following the election, after a week of negotiation it was announced that Patrick Harley would remain leader of the council while Labour would be in charge of the majority of scrutiny committee chairmanships and the mayoralty. As Leader of the Council, Cllr Harley was in charge of appointing the Council&#x27;s cabinet, meaning Dudley Council became a Conservative minority administration. The appointed cabinet was decided on 16 May 2024. It was subsequently criticised by the council&#x27;s Labour councillors for a lack of diversity, with only one woman in its line-up and no councillors from ethnic minorities.

There have subsequently been some by-elections. The current make-up of the council is:

==Premises==
The council has its main offices at Dudley Council House on Priory Road, which was built in phases between 1928 and 1935 for the old county borough council. The main customer services reception is in a converted shop in the town centre at 259 Castle Street.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2004 the council has comprised 72 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) being elected each time for a four-year term of office. Elections for the Mayor of the West Midlands are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections. New ward boundaries are being prepared to take effect from the 2024 election, which will require all seats to be contested at that election.

=== Wards ===
The 24 wards of the Dudley Borough are each represented by 3 councillors. The council groups wards together into 5 Community Forums to enable community engagement under the banner &#x27;Your home, your forum&#x27;.
== Members of parliament ==
Following the 2023 review of constituencies and the July 2024 UK general election, the members of parliament for constituencies within Dudley MBC area are:
== Chief Executives ==
== Mayor of Dudley and Civic Awards ==
The Mayor presides over meetings of the full Council to ensure that business is carried out properly and efficiently, with due regard to the rights of Councillors and the interest of the Community. The Mayor of the Borough is elected at the Annual Meeting of the Council (usually in May each year) from the existing elected councillors.

The Mayor also nominates charities they wish to support during their mayoral year and hosts the annual Mayors Ball and Civic Awards. The Civic Awards aim to recognise individuals and groups who make a difference in the borough. Each award is named for a local personality in that field.
* The Frank Foley award for community spirit
* The William Shenstone award for environment
* The Duncan Edwards award for sport
* The Cedric Hardwicke award for arts
* The Thomas Attwood award for education
* The Mike Holder award for business

== Civic arms and motto ==
Dudley&#x27;s coat of arms was designed in 1975. It symbolises each of the authorities that came together to form the present borough. Key themes on the civic arms reflect the area&#x27;s pride in its industrial past.

The council adopted &quot;Unity and Progress&quot; as its motto in 1974.

<text>Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), density relative to extracellular water, is a type of lipoprotein made by the liver. VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein) that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water-based solution of the bloodstream. VLDL is assembled in the liver from triglycerides, cholesterol, and apolipoproteins. VLDL is converted in the bloodstream to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30–80 nanometers (nm). VLDL transports endogenous products, whereas chylomicrons transport exogenous (dietary) products. In the early 2010s both the lipid composition and protein composition of this lipoprotein were characterised in great detail.

==Physical properties==
Very-low-density lipoprotein size is variable, with diameters ranging from approximately 35 to 70 nm. Some researchers further classify VLDL particles into VLDL1 and VLDL2 based on size (as measured by Svedberg flotation units), where VLDL1 particles are larger and contain more triglycerides, while other researchers create a tripartite system by subdividing VLDL1 into larger VLDL1 and smaller VLDL2 and relabeling VLDL2 as VLDL3.

== Function ==

Very-low-density lipoproteins transport endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters. They function as the body&#x27;s internal transport mechanism for lipids. In addition they can assist in long-range transport of hydrophobic intercellular messengers, like the morphogen Indian hedgehog (protein).

== Changes during circulation ==
Nascent VLDL released from the liver contains apolipoprotein B100, apolipoprotein C1 (apoC1), apolipoprotein E (apoE), cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides. As it circulates in blood, it picks up apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) and additional apoE donated from high-density lipoprotein (HDL). At this point, nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, VLDL will come in contact with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). LPL will remove triglycerides from VLDL for storage or energy production. VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to HDL (but keeps apoE). HDL also transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides via cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP). As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of LPL and CETP enzymes, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL).

Fifty percent of IDLs are recognized by receptors in the liver cells because of the apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) and apoE they contain and are endocytosed. The other 50% of IDL lose apoE; when their cholesterol content becomes greater than the content of triglyceride, they become LDL, with apoB-100 as the primary apolipoprotein. The LDL is taken into a cell via the LDL receptor via endocytosis, where the contents are either stored, used for cell membrane structure, or converted into other products such as steroid hormones or bile acids.

<doc id="502418" wikidata="Q1352217" url="?curid=502418" title="Mugi, Tokushima">
<text>is a town located in Kaifu District, Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 3,734 in 1971 households and a population density of 66 persons per km2. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Mugi is located along the southeastern coast of Tokushima Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. The Mugi River runs through the center of the town forming a basin suitable for agriculture. The town faces the Pacific Ocean along a series of cliffs to the east, and is subject to frequent typhoons. There are a number islands offshore, including Oshima, the largest uninhabited island in Tokushima Prefecture, and Teba Island, which is inhabited. Parts of the town are within the borders of the Muroto-Anan Kaigan Quasi-National Park.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
* Kaiyō
* Minami

===Climate===
Mugi has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light snowfall. The average annual temperature in Mugi is 16.2 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2330 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.0 °C, and lowest in January, at around 6.6 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Mugi has been declining rapidly since the 1960s, and is now roughly half of what it was a century ago.

== History ==
As with all of Tokushima Prefecture, the area of Mugi was part of ancient Awa Province. It was noted for ocean-borne shipping, especially of timber, from Tosa Province to the Kinai region . During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Tokushima Domain ruled by the Hachisuka clan from their seat at Tokushima Castle. In 1830, Australian convicts heading for Canton, China laid anchor off the coast of Mugi in a convict transport vessel, the brig &quot;Cyprus&quot;, which they had seized from their masters while being transported to Macquarie Harbour Penal Station in the former British penal colony of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, now Tasmania, an incident known as the Cyprus mutiny. The convicts were attacked and sent away by the Japanese, in line with the isolationist policy of the time. This may be the first incidence of an Australian aboriginal boomerang being gifted to Japanese people by Australian visitors. Other trading and a toast to the recently deceased wife of one of the crew was also held.

The village of Mugi was established within Kaifu District, Tokushima with the creation of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on November 10, 1915. The 1946 Nankai earthquake caused great damage to the town, killing 53 people and completely destroying 374 homes.

==Government==
Mugi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of eight members. Mugi, together with the other municipalities of Kaifu District, contributes two members to the Tokushima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Tokushima 1st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Mugi has an economy based on agriculture and commercial fishing.

==Education==
Mugi has one public elementary school and one public middle school operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
 Shikoku Railway Company – Mugi Line

=== Highways ===

==Sister cities==
* Puyan, Changhua, Taiwan, sister city since 1983

<text>In computational complexity theory, a complexity class is a set of computational problems &quot;of related resource-based complexity&quot;. The two most commonly analyzed resources are time and memory. 

In general, a complexity class is defined in terms of a type of computational problem, a model of computation, and a bounded resource like time or memory. In particular, most complexity classes consist of decision problems that are solvable with a Turing machine, and are differentiated by their time or space (memory) requirements. For instance, the class [[P (complexity)|P]] is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. There are, however, many complexity classes defined in terms of other types of problems (e.g. counting problems and function problems) and using other models of computation (e.g. probabilistic Turing machines, interactive proof systems, Boolean circuits, and quantum computers).

The study of the relationships between complexity classes is a major area of research in theoretical computer science. There are often general hierarchies of complexity classes; for example, it is known that a number of fundamental time and space complexity classes relate to each other in the following way: [[Complexity class|L]]⊆[[NL (complexity)|NL]]⊆[[P (complexity)|P]]⊆[[NP (complexity)|NP]]⊆[[PSPACE]]⊆[[EXPTIME]]⊆[[NEXPTIME]]⊆[[EXPSPACE]] (where ⊆ denotes the subset relation). However, many relationships are not yet known; for example, one of the most famous open problems in computer science concerns whether [[Complexity class|P]] equals [[Complexity class|NP]]. The relationships between classes often answer questions about the fundamental nature of computation. The P versus NP problem, for instance, is directly related to questions of whether nondeterminism adds any computational power to computers and whether problems having solutions that can be quickly checked for correctness can also be quickly solved.

==Background==
Complexity classes are sets of related computational problems. They are defined in terms of the computational difficulty of solving the problems contained within them with respect to particular computational resources like time or memory. More formally, the definition of a complexity class consists of three things: a type of computational problem, a model of computation, and a bounded computational resource. In particular, most complexity classes consist of decision problems that can be solved by a Turing machine with bounded time or space resources. For example, the complexity class P is defined as the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.

===Computational problems===
Intuitively, a computational problem is just a question that can be solved by an algorithm. For example, &quot;is the natural number formula_1 prime?&quot; is a computational problem. A computational problem is mathematically represented as the set of answers to the problem. In the primality example, the problem (call it formula_2) is represented by the set of all natural numbers that are prime: formula_3. In the theory of computation, these answers are represented as strings; for example, in the primality example the natural numbers could be represented as strings of bits that represent binary numbers. For this reason, computational problems are often synonymously referred to as languages, since strings of bits represent formal languages (a concept borrowed from linguistics); for example, saying that the formula_2 problem is in the complexity class NP is equivalent to saying that the language formula_2 is in NP.

====Decision problems====

The most commonly analyzed problems in theoretical computer science are decision problems—the kinds of problems that can be posed as yes–no questions. The primality example above, for instance, is an example of a decision problem as it can be represented by the yes–no question &quot;is the natural number formula_1 prime&quot;. In terms of the theory of computation, a decision problem is represented as the set of input strings that a computer running a correct algorithm would answer &quot;yes&quot; to. In the primality example, formula_2 is the set of strings representing natural numbers that, when input into a computer running an algorithm that correctly tests for primality, the algorithm answers &quot;yes, this number is prime&quot;. This &quot;yes-no&quot; format is often equivalently stated as &quot;accept-reject&quot;; that is, an algorithm &quot;accepts&quot; an input string if the answer to the decision problem is &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;rejects&quot; if the answer is &quot;no&quot;.

While some problems cannot easily be expressed as decision problems, they nonetheless encompass a broad range of computational problems. Other types of problems that certain complexity classes are defined in terms of include:

* Function problems (e.g. FP)
* Counting problems (e.g. #P)
* Optimization problems
* Promise problems (see section &quot;Other types of problems&quot;)

===Computational models===
To make concrete the notion of a &quot;computer&quot;, in theoretical computer science problems are analyzed in the context of a computational model. Computational models make exact the notions of computational resources like &quot;time&quot; and &quot;memory&quot;. In computational complexity theory, complexity classes deal with the &quot;inherent&quot; resource requirements of problems and not the resource requirements that depend upon how a physical computer is constructed. For example, in the real world different computers may require different amounts of time and memory to solve the same problem because of the way that they have been engineered. By providing an abstract mathematical representations of computers, computational models abstract away superfluous complexities of the real world (like differences in processor speed) that obstruct an understanding of fundamental principles.

The most commonly used computational model is the Turing machine. While other models exist and many complexity classes are defined in terms of them (see section &quot;Other models of computation&quot;), the Turing machine is used to define most basic complexity classes. With the Turing machine, instead of using standard units of time like the second (which make it impossible to disentangle running time from the speed of physical hardware) and standard units of memory like bytes, the notion of time is abstracted as the number of elementary steps that a Turing machine takes to solve a problem and the notion of memory is abstracted as the number of cells that are used on the machine&#x27;s tape. These are explained in greater detail below.

It is also possible to use the Blum axioms to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete computational model, but this approach is less frequently used in complexity theory.

====Deterministic Turing machines====
A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is the most commonly used model in complexity theory, owing in large part to the fact that it is believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation and is easy to analyze mathematically. Importantly, it is believed that if there exists an algorithm that solves a particular problem then there also exists a Turing machine that solves that same problem (this is known as the Church–Turing thesis); this means that it is believed that &quot;every&quot; algorithm can be represented as a Turing machine.

Mechanically, a Turing machine (TM) manipulates symbols (generally restricted to the bits 0 and 1 to provide an intuitive connection to real-life computers) contained on an infinitely long strip of tape. The TM can read and write, one at a time, using a tape head. Operation is fully determined by a finite set of elementary instructions such as &quot;in state 42, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1; if the symbol seen is 1, change into state 17; in state 17, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1 and change to state 6&quot;. The Turing machine starts with only the input string on its tape and blanks everywhere else. The TM accepts the input if it enters a designated accept state and rejects the input if it enters a reject state. The deterministic Turing machine (DTM) is the most basic type of Turing machine. It uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions (which is why it is called &quot;deterministic&quot;).

A computational problem can then be defined in terms of a Turing machine as the set of input strings that a particular Turing machine accepts. For example, the primality problem formula_2 from above is the set of strings (representing natural numbers) that a Turing machine running an algorithm that correctly tests for primality accepts. A Turing machine is said to recognize a language (recall that &quot;problem&quot; and &quot;language&quot; are largely synonymous in computability and complexity theory) if it accepts all inputs that are in the language and is said to decide a language if it additionally rejects all inputs that are not in the language (certain inputs may cause a Turing machine to run forever, so decidability places the additional constraint over recognizability that the Turing machine must halt on all inputs). A Turing machine that &quot;solves&quot; a problem is generally meant to mean one that decides the language.

Turing machines enable intuitive notions of &quot;time&quot; and &quot;space&quot;. The time complexity of a TM on a particular input is the number of elementary steps that the Turing machine takes to reach either an accept or reject state. The space complexity is the number of cells on its tape that it uses to reach either an accept or reject state.

====Nondeterministic Turing machines====

The deterministic Turing machine (DTM) is a variant of the nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM). Intuitively, an NTM is just a regular Turing machine that has the added capability of being able to explore multiple possible future actions from a given state, and &quot;choosing&quot; a branch that accepts (if any accept). That is, while a DTM must follow only one branch of computation, an NTM can be imagined as a computation tree, branching into many possible computational pathways at each step (see image). If at least one branch of the tree halts with an &quot;accept&quot; condition, then the NTM accepts the input. In this way, an NTM can be thought of as simultaneously exploring all computational possibilities in parallel and selecting an accepting branch. NTMs are not meant to be physically realizable models, they are simply theoretically interesting abstract machines that give rise to a number of interesting complexity classes (which often do have physically realizable equivalent definitions). 

The time complexity of an NTM is the maximum number of steps that the NTM uses on &quot;any&quot; branch of its computation. Similarly, the space complexity of an NTM is the maximum number of cells that the NTM uses on any branch of its computation.

DTMs can be viewed as a special case of NTMs that do not make use of the power of nondeterminism. Hence, every computation that can be carried out by a DTM can also be carried out by an equivalent NTM. It is also possible to simulate any NTM using a DTM (the DTM will simply compute every possible computational branch one-by-one). Hence, the two are equivalent in terms of computability. However, simulating an NTM with a DTM often requires greater time and/or memory resources; as will be seen, how significant this slowdown is for certain classes of computational problems is an important question in computational complexity theory.

===Resource bounds===
Complexity classes group computational problems by their resource requirements. To do this, computational problems are differentiated by upper bounds on the maximum amount of resources that the most efficient algorithm takes to solve them. More specifically, complexity classes are concerned with the &quot;rate of growth&quot; in the resources required to solve particular computational problems as the input size increases. For example, the amount of time it takes to solve problems in the complexity class P grows at a polynomial rate as the input size increases, which is comparatively slow compared to problems in the exponential complexity class EXPTIME (or more accurately, for problems in EXPTIME that are outside of P, since formula_9).

Note that the study of complexity classes is intended primarily to understand the &quot;inherent&quot; complexity required to solve computational problems. Complexity theorists are thus generally concerned with finding the smallest complexity class that a problem falls into and are therefore concerned with identifying which class a computational problem falls into using the &quot;most efficient&quot; algorithm. There may be an algorithm, for instance, that solves a particular problem in exponential time, but if the most efficient algorithm for solving this problem runs in polynomial time then the inherent time complexity of that problem is better described as polynomial.

====Time bounds====

The time complexity of an algorithm with respect to the Turing machine model is the number of steps it takes for a Turing machine to run an algorithm on a given input size. Formally, the time complexity for an algorithm implemented with a Turing machine formula_10 is defined as the function formula_11, where formula_12 is the maximum number of steps that formula_10 takes on any input of length formula_1.

In computational complexity theory, theoretical computer scientists are concerned less with particular runtime values and more with the general class of functions that the time complexity function falls into. For instance, is the time complexity function a polynomial? A logarithmic function? An exponential function? Or another kind of function? 

====Space bounds====

The space complexity of an algorithm with respect to the Turing machine model is the number of cells on the Turing machine&#x27;s tape that are required to run an algorithm on a given input size. Formally, the space complexity of an algorithm implemented with a Turing machine formula_10 is defined as the function formula_16, where formula_17 is the maximum number of cells that formula_10 uses on any input of length formula_1.

==Basic complexity classes==
===Basic definitions===
Complexity classes are often defined using granular sets of complexity classes called DTIME and NTIME (for time complexity) and DSPACE and NSPACE (for space complexity). Using big O notation, they are defined as follows:
* The time complexity class formula_20 is the set of all problems that are decided by an formula_21 time deterministic Turing machine.
* The time complexity class formula_22 is the set of all problems that are decided by an formula_21 time nondeterministic Turing machine.
* The space complexity class formula_24 is the set of all problems that are decided by an formula_25 space deterministic Turing machine.
* The space complexity class formula_26 is the set of all problems that are decided by an formula_25 space nondeterministic Turing machine.

===Time complexity classes===
====P and NP====

P is the class of problems that are solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time and NP is the class of problems that are solvable by a nondeterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. Or more formally,
: formula_28
: formula_29

P is often said to be the class of problems that can be solved &quot;quickly&quot; or &quot;efficiently&quot; by a deterministic computer, since the time complexity of solving a problem in P increases relatively slowly with the input size.

An important characteristic of the class NP is that it can be equivalently defined as the class of problems whose solutions are &quot;verifiable&quot; by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. That is, a language is in NP if there exists a &quot;deterministic&quot; polynomial time Turing machine, referred to as the verifier, that takes as input a string formula_30 &quot;and&quot; a polynomial-size certificate string formula_31, and accepts formula_30 if formula_30 is in the language and rejects formula_30 if formula_30 is not in the language. Intuitively, the certificate acts as a proof that the input formula_30 is in the language. Formally:
: NP is the class of languages formula_37 for which there exists a polynomial-time deterministic Turing machine formula_10 and a polynomial formula_39 such that for all formula_40, formula_30 is in formula_37 &quot;if and only if&quot; there exists some formula_43 such that formula_44 accepts.

This equivalence between the nondeterministic definition and the verifier definition highlights a fundamental connection between nondeterminism and solution verifiability. Furthermore, it also provides a useful method for proving that a language is in NP—simply identify a suitable certificate and show that it can be verified in polynomial time.

=====The P versus NP problem=====
While there might seem to be an obvious difference between the class of problems that are efficiently solvable and the class of problems whose solutions are merely efficiently checkable, P and NP are actually at the center of one of the most famous unsolved problems in computer science: the P versus NP problem. While it is known that formula_45 (intuitively, deterministic Turing machines are just a subclass of nondeterministic Turing machines that don&#x27;t make use of their nondeterminism; or under the verifier definition, P is the class of problems whose polynomial time verifiers need only receive the empty string as their certificate), it is not known whether NP is strictly larger than P. If P=NP, then it follows that nondeterminism provides &quot;no additional computational power&quot; over determinism with regards to the ability to quickly find a solution to a problem; that is, being able to explore &quot;all possible branches&quot; of computation provides &quot;at most&quot; a polynomial speedup over being able to explore only a single branch. Furthermore, it would follow that if there exists a proof for a problem instance and that proof can be quickly be checked for correctness (that is, if the problem is in NP), then there also exists an algorithm that can quickly &quot;construct&quot; that proof (that is, the problem is in P). However, the overwhelming majority of computer scientists believe that formula_46, and most cryptographic schemes employed today rely on the assumption that formula_46.

====EXPTIME and NEXPTIME====

EXPTIME (sometimes shortened to EXP) is the class of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in exponential time and NEXPTIME (sometimes shortened to NEXP) is the class of decision problems solvable by a nondeterministic Turing machine in exponential time. Or more formally,
: formula_48
: formula_49

EXPTIME is a strict superset of P and NEXPTIME is a strict superset of NP. It is further the case that EXPTIMEformula_50NEXPTIME. It is not known whether this is proper, but if P=NP then EXPTIME must equal NEXPTIME.

===Space complexity classes===
====L and NL====

While it is possible to define logarithmic time complexity classes, these are extremely narrow classes as sublinear times do not even enable a Turing machine to read the entire input (because formula_51). However, there are a meaningful number of problems that can be solved in logarithmic space. The definitions of these classes require a two-tape Turing machine so that it is possible for the machine to store the entire input (it can be shown that in terms of computability the two-tape Turing machine is equivalent to the single-tape Turing machine). In the two-tape Turing machine model, one tape is the input tape, which is read-only. The other is the work tape, which allows both reading and writing and is the tape on which the Turing machine performs computations. The space complexity of the Turing machine is measured as the number of cells that are used on the work tape.

L (sometimes lengthened to LOGSPACE) is then defined as the class of problems solvable in logarithmic space on a deterministic Turing machine and NL (sometimes lengthened to NLOGSPACE) is the class of problems solvable in logarithmic space on a nondeterministic Turing machine. Or more formally,
:formula_52
:formula_53

It is known that formula_54. However, it is not known whether any of these relationships is proper.

====PSPACE and NPSPACE====

The complexity classes PSPACE and NPSPACE are the space analogues to P and NP. That is, PSPACE is the class of problems solvable in polynomial space by a deterministic Turing machine and NPSPACE is the class of problems solvable in polynomial space by a nondeterministic Turing machine. More formally,
:formula_55
:formula_56

While it is not known whether P=NP, Savitch&#x27;s theorem  famously showed that PSPACE=NPSPACE. It is also known that formula_57, which follows intuitively from the fact that, since writing to a cell on a Turing machine&#x27;s tape is defined as taking one unit of time, a Turing machine operating in polynomial time can only write to polynomially many cells. It is suspected that P is strictly smaller than PSPACE, but this has not been proven.

====EXPSPACE and NEXPSPACE====

The complexity classes EXPSPACE and NEXPSPACE are the space analogues to EXPTIME and NEXPTIME. That is, EXPSPACE is the class of problems solvable in exponential space by a deterministic Turing machine and NEXPSPACE is the class of problems solvable in exponential space by a nondeterministic Turing machine. Or more formally,
:formula_58
:formula_59

Savitch&#x27;s theorem showed that EXPSPACE=NEXPSPACE. This class is extremely broad: it is known to be a strict superset of PSPACE, NP, and P, and is believed to be a strict superset of EXPTIME.

==Properties of complexity classes==
===Closure===
Complexity classes have a variety of closure properties. For example, decision classes may be closed under negation, disjunction, conjunction, or even under all Boolean operations. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. P, for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. Closure properties can be helpful in separating classes—one possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one class but not by the other.

Each class X that is not closed under negation has a complement class co-X, which consists of the complements of the languages contained in X (i.e. formula_60). co-NP, for instance, is one important complement complexity class, and sits at the center of the unsolved problem over whether co-NP=NP.

Closure properties are one of the key reasons many complexity classes are defined in the way that they are. Take, for example, a problem that can be solved in formula_61 time (that is, in linear time) and one that can be solved in, at best, formula_62 time. Both of these problems are in P, yet the runtime of the second grows considerably faster than the runtime of the first as the input size increases. One might ask whether it would be better to define the class of &quot;efficiently solvable&quot; problems using some smaller polynomial bound, like formula_63, rather than all polynomials, which allows for such large discrepancies. It turns out, however, that the set of all polynomials is the smallest class of functions containing the linear functions that is also closed under addition, multiplication, and composition (for instance, formula_64, which is a polynomial but formula_65). Since we would like composing one efficient algorithm with another efficient algorithm to still be considered efficient, the polynomials are the smallest class that ensures composition of &quot;efficient algorithms&quot;. (Note that the definition of P is also useful because, empirically, almost all problems in P that are practically useful do in fact have low order polynomial runtimes, and almost all problems outside of P that are practically useful do not have any known algorithms with small exponential runtimes, i.e. with formula_66 runtimes where is close to 1.)

===Reductions===

Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem, i.e. a reduction takes inputs from one problem and transforms them into inputs of another problem. For instance, you can reduce ordinary base-10 addition formula_67 to base-2 addition by transforming formula_68 and formula_69 to their base-2 notation (e.g. 5+7 becomes 101+111). Formally, a problem formula_70 reduces to a problem formula_71 if there exists a function formula_72 such that for every formula_73, formula_74 &quot;if and only if&quot; formula_75.

Generally, reductions are used to capture the notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. Thus we are generally interested in using a polynomial-time reduction, since any problem formula_70 that can be efficiently reduced to another problem formula_71 is no more difficult than formula_71. Formally, a problem formula_70 is polynomial-time reducible to a problem formula_71 if there exists a &quot;polynomial-time&quot; computable function formula_39 such that for all formula_82, formula_74 &quot;if and only if&quot; formula_84.

Note that reductions can be defined in many different ways. Common reductions are Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and can vary based on resource bounds, such as polynomial-time reductions and log-space reductions. 

====Hardness====
Reductions motivate the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem formula_70 is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be polynomial-time reduced to formula_70. Thus no problem in C is harder than formula_70, since an algorithm for formula_70 allows us to solve any problem in C with at most polynomial slowdown. Of particular importance, the set of problems that are hard for NP is called the set of NP-hard problems.

====Completeness====
If a problem formula_70 is hard for C and is also in C, then formula_70 is said to be complete for C. This means that formula_70 is the hardest problem in C (since there could be many problems that are equally hard, more precisely formula_70 is as hard as the hardest problems in C). 

Of particular importance is the class of NP-complete problems—the most difficult problems in NP. Because all problems in NP can be polynomial-time reduced to NP-complete problems, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P = NP.

==Relationships between complexity classes==

===Savitch&#x27;s theorem===

Savitch&#x27;s theorem establishes the relationship between deterministic and nondetermistic space resources. It shows that if a nondeterministic Turing machine can solve a problem using formula_93 space, then a deterministic Turing machine can solve the same problem in formula_94 space, i.e. in the square of the space. Formally, Savitch&#x27;s theorem states that for any formula_95,

:formula_96

Important corollaries of Savitch&#x27;s theorem are that PSPACE = NPSPACE (since the square of a polynomial is still a polynomial) and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE (since the square of an exponential is still an exponential).

These relationships answer fundamental questions about the power of nondeterminism compared to determinism. Specifically, Savitch&#x27;s theorem shows that any problem that a nondeterministic Turing machine can solve in polynomial space, a deterministic Turing machine can also solve in polynomial space. Similarly, any problem that a nondeterministic Turing machine can solve in exponential space, a deterministic Turing machine can also solve in exponential space.

===Hierarchy theorems===

By definition of DTIME, it follows that formula_97 is contained in formula_98 if formula_99, since formula_100 if formula_101. However, this definition gives no indication of whether this inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the conditions under which the inclusion is strict are given by the time and space hierarchy theorems, respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. The hierarchy theorems enable one to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.

The time hierarchy theorem states that
:formula_102.

The space hierarchy theorem states that
:formula_103.

The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem establishes that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem establishes that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.

==Other models of computation==
While deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines are the most commonly used models of computation, many complexity classes are defined in terms of other computational models. In particular,
* A number of classes are defined using probabilistic Turing machines, including the classes BPP, PP, RP, and ZPP
* A number of classes are defined using interactive proof systems, including the classes IP, MA, and AM
* A number of classes are defined using Boolean circuits, including the classes P/poly and its subclasses NC and AC
* A number of classes are defined using quantum Turing machines, including the classes BQP and QMA

These are explained in greater detail below.

===Randomized computation===
A number of important complexity classes are defined using the probabilistic Turing machine, a variant of the Turing machine that can toss random coins. These classes help to better describe the complexity of randomized algorithms.

A probabilistic Turing machine is similar to a deterministic Turing machine, except rather than following a single transition function (a set of rules for how to proceed at each step of the computation) it probabilistically selects between multiple transition functions at each step. The standard definition of a probabilistic Turing machine specifies two transition functions, so that the selection of transition function at each step resembles a coin flip. The randomness introduced at each step of the computation introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of error that is allowed. Formally, they are defined using an error probability formula_104. A probabilistic Turing machine formula_10 is said to recognize a language formula_37 with error probability formula_104 if:
# a string formula_30 in formula_37 implies that formula_110
# a string formula_30 not in formula_37 implies that formula_113

====Important complexity classes====
The fundamental randomized time complexity classes are ZPP, RP, co-RP, BPP, and PP.

The strictest class is ZPP (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands &quot;no error whatsoever&quot;. 

A slightly looser class is RP (randomized polynomial time), which maintains no error for strings not in the language but allows bounded error for strings in the language. More formally, a language is in RP if there is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine formula_10 such that if a string is not in the language then formula_10 always rejects and if a string is in the language then formula_10 accepts with a probability at least 1/2. The class co-RP is similarly defined except the roles are flipped: error is not allowed for strings in the language but is allowed for strings not in the language. Taken together, the classes RP and co-RP encompass all of the problems that can be solved by probabilistic Turing machines with one-sided error. 

Loosening the error requirements further to allow for two-sided error yields the class BPP (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability less than 1/3 (for both strings in the language and not in the language). BPP is the most practically relevant of the probabilistic complexity classes—problems in BPP have efficient randomized algorithms that can be run quickly on real computers. BPP is also at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether P=BPP, which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. 

The broadest class of efficiently-solvable probabilistic problems is PP (probabilistic polynomial time), the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.

ZPP, RP and co-RP are all subsets of BPP, which in turn is a subset of PP. The reason for this is intuitive: the classes allowing zero error and only one-sided error are all contained within the class that allows two-sided error, and PP simply relaxes the error probability of BPP. ZPP relates to RP and co-RP in the following way: formula_117. That is, ZPP consists exactly of those problems that are in both RP and co-RP. Intuitively, this follows from the fact that RP and co-RP allow only one-sided error: co-RP does not allow error for strings in the language and RP does not allow error for strings not in the language. Hence, if a problem is in both RP and co-RP, then there must be no error for strings both in &quot;and&quot; not in the language (i.e. no error whatsoever), which is exactly the definition of ZPP. 

Important randomized space complexity classes include BPL, RL, and RLP.

===Interactive proof systems===

A number of complexity classes are defined using interactive proof systems. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class NP and yield insights into cryptography, approximation algorithms, and formal verification.
Interactive proof systems are abstract machines that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover formula_118 and a verifier formula_119. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover formula_118 has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover solve for whether a string is in a language and then sending a trustworthy &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot; to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an &quot;interrogation&quot; of the prover by &quot;asking it&quot; successive rounds of questions, accepting only if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.

====Important complexity classes====
The class NP is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full proof—typically referred to as the certificate—to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class NP (the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is &quot;YES&quot;, have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine) is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by an unmentioned prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. For this reason, NP can also be called dIP (deterministic interactive proof), though it is rarely referred to as such.

It turns out that NP captures the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because it can be shown that for any proof system with a deterministic verifier it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require &quot;probabilistic&quot; verifiers, which means that the verifier&#x27;s questions to the prover are computed using probabilistic algorithms. As noted in the section above on randomized computation, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of an error probability formula_104. 

The most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class IP (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system formula_122, where formula_119 is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language formula_124
# (Completeness) a string formula_30 in formula_37 implies formula_127
# (Soundness) a string formula_30 not in formula_37 implies formula_130

An important feature of IP is that it equals PSPACE. In other words, any problem that can be solved by a polynomial-time interactive proof system can also be solved by a deterministic Turing machine with polynomial space resources, and vice versa.

A modification of the protocol for IP produces another important complexity class: AM (Arthur–Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by IP, the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation—it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called &quot;private random coins&quot;. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are &quot;public random coins&quot;; that is, the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, AM is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. AM can be generalized to AM[&quot;k&quot;], where &quot;k&quot; is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard AM defined above is AM[2]). However, it is the case that for all formula_131, AM[&quot;k&quot;]=AM[2]. It is also the case that formula_132.

Other complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include MIP (multiprover interactive polynomial time) and QIP (quantum interactive polynomial time).

===Boolean circuits===
An alternative model of computation to the Turing machine is the Boolean circuit, a simplified model of the digital circuits used in modern computers. Not only does this model provide an intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for non-uniform computation (computation in which different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms).

Formally, a Boolean circuit formula_133 is a directed acyclic graph in which edges represent wires (which carry the bit values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by source vertices (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent logic gates (generally the AND, OR, and NOT gates). One logic gate is designated the output gate, and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit formula_133 with formula_1 input variables is represented by the Boolean function formula_136; for example, on input bits formula_137, the output bit formula_138 of the circuit is represented mathematically as formula_139. The circuit formula_133 is said to &quot;compute&quot; the Boolean function formula_141.

Any particular circuit has a fixed number of input vertices, so it can only act on inputs of that size. Languages (the formal representations of decision problems), however, contain strings of differing lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (this contrasts with the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine that can act on any input size). A language is thus represented by a circuit family. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits formula_142, where formula_143 is a circuit with formula_1 input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language formula_37 if, for every string formula_30, formula_30 is in the language formula_37 if and only if formula_149, where formula_1 is the length of formula_30. In other words, a string formula_30 of size formula_1 is in the language represented by the circuit family formula_142 if the circuit formula_143 (the circuit with the same number of input vertices as the number of bits in formula_30) evaluates to 1 when formula_30 is its input.

While complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of time complexity, circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size — the number of vertices in the circuit. The size complexity of a circuit family formula_142 is the function formula_159, where formula_93 is the circuit size of formula_143. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size circuit family is one such that the function formula_72 is a polynomial.

====Important complexity classes====
The complexity class P/poly is the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (that is, requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (that is, requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in formula_20, where formula_164 is a function formula_165, then it has circuit complexity formula_166. It follows directly from this fact that formula_167. In other words, any problem that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be solved by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper, i.e. formula_168 (for example, there are some undecidable problems that are in P/poly).

P/poly has a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to P versus NP. For example, if there is any language in NP that is not in P/poly, then formula_46. P/poly is also helpful in investigating properties of the polynomial hierarchy. For example, if NP ⊆ P/poly, then PH collapses to formula_170. A full description of the relations between P/poly and other complexity classes is available at &quot;Importance of P/poly&quot;. P/poly is also helpful in the general study of the properties of Turing machines, as the class can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded advice function.

Two subclasses of P/poly that have interesting properties in their own right are NC and AC. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their depth. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest directed path from an input node to the output node. The class NC is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having polylogarithmic depth. The class AC is defined similarly to NC, however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). NC is a notable class because it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages that have efficient parallel algorithms.

===Quantum computation===
The classes BQP and QMA, which are of key importance in quantum information science, are defined using quantum Turing machines.

==Other types of problems==
While most complexity classes studied by computer scientists are sets of decision problems, there are also a number of complexity classes defined in terms of other types of problems. In particular, there are complexity classes consisting of counting problems, function problems, and promise problems. These are explained in greater detail below.

===Counting problems===

A counting problem asks not only &quot;whether&quot; a solution exists (as with a decision problem), but asks &quot;how many&quot; solutions exist. For example, the decision problem formula_171 asks &quot;whether&quot; a particular graph formula_172 has a simple cycle (the answer is a simple yes/no); the corresponding counting problem formula_173 (pronounced &quot;sharp cycle&quot;) asks &quot;how many&quot; simple cycles formula_172 has. The output to a counting problem is thus a number, in contrast to the output for a decision problem, which is a simple yes/no (or accept/reject, 0/1, or other equivalent scheme). 

Thus, whereas decision problems are represented mathematically as formal languages, counting problems are represented mathematically as functions: a counting problem is formalized as the function formula_175 such that for every input formula_40, formula_177 is the number of solutions. For example, in the formula_173 problem, the input is a graph formula_179 (a graph represented as a string of bits) and formula_180 is the number of simple cycles in formula_172. 

Counting problems arise in a number of fields, including statistical estimation, statistical physics, network design, and economics.

==== Important complexity classes ====

#P (pronounced &quot;sharp P&quot;) is an important class of counting problems that can be thought of as the counting version of NP. The connection to NP arises from the fact that the number of solutions to a problem equals the number of accepting branches in a nondeterministic Turing machine&#x27;s computation tree. #P is thus formally defined as follows:
: #P is the set of all functions formula_175 such that there is a polynomial time nondeterministic Turing machine formula_10 such that for all formula_40, formula_177 equals the number of accepting branches in formula_10&#x27;s computation tree on formula_30. 

And just as NP can be defined both in terms of nondeterminism and in terms of a verifier (i.e. as an interactive proof system), so too can #P be equivalently defined in terms of a verifier. Recall that a decision problem is in NP if there exists a polynomial-time checkable certificate to a given problem instance—that is, NP asks whether there exists a proof of membership (a certificate) for the input that can be checked for correctness in polynomial time. The class #P asks &quot;how many&quot; such certificates exist. In this context, #P is defined as follows:
: #P is the set of functions formula_188 such that there exists a polynomial formula_189 and a polynomial-time Turing machine formula_119 (the verifier), such that for every formula_40, formula_192. In other words, formula_177 equals the size of the set containing all of the polynomial-size certificates for formula_30.

===Function problems===

Counting problems are a subset of a broader class of problems called function problems. A function problem is a type of problem in which the values of a function formula_195 are computed. Formally, a function problem formula_72 is defined as a relation formula_197 over strings of an arbitrary alphabet formula_198:
:formula_199
An algorithm solves formula_72 if for every input formula_68 such that there exists a formula_69 satisfying formula_203, the algorithm produces one such formula_69. This is just another way of saying that formula_72 is a function and the algorithm solves formula_206 for all formula_82.

====Important complexity classes====
An important function complexity class is FP, the class of efficiently solvable functions. More specifically, FP is the set of function problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. FP can be thought of as the function problem equivalent of P. Importantly, FP provides some insight into both counting problems and P versus NP. If #P=FP, then the functions that determine the number of certificates for problems in NP are efficiently solvable. And since computing the number of certificates is at least as hard as determining whether a certificate exists, it must follow that if #P=FP then P=NP (it is not known whether this holds in the reverse, i.e. whether P=NP implies #P=FP). 

Just as FP is the function problem equivalent of P, FNP is the function problem equivalent of NP. Importantly, FP=FNP if and only if P=NP.

===Promise problems===

Promise problems are a generalization of decision problems in which the input to a problem is guaranteed (&quot;promised&quot;) to be from a particular subset of all possible inputs. Recall that with a decision problem formula_208, an algorithm formula_10 for formula_37 must act (correctly) on &quot;every&quot; formula_40. A promise problem loosens the input requirement on formula_10 by restricting the input to some subset of formula_213. 

Specifically, a promise problem is defined as a pair of non-intersecting sets formula_214, where:
* formula_215 is the set of all inputs that are accepted.
* formula_216 is the set of all inputs that are rejected.

The input to an algorithm formula_10 for a promise problem formula_214 is thus formula_219, which is called the promise. Strings in formula_219 are said to &quot;satisfy the promise&quot;. By definition, formula_221 and formula_222 must be disjoint, i.e. formula_223. 

Within this formulation, it can be seen that decision problems are just the subset of promise problems with the trivial promise formula_224. With decision problems it is thus simpler to simply define the problem as only formula_221 (with formula_222 implicitly being formula_227), which throughout this page is denoted formula_37 to emphasize that formula_229 is a formal language.

Promise problems make for a more natural formulation of many computational problems. For instance, a computational problem could be something like &quot;given a planar graph, determine whether or not...&quot; This is often stated as a decision problem, where it is assumed that there is some translation schema that takes &quot;every&quot; string formula_230 to a planar graph. However, it is more straightforward to define this as a promise problem in which the input is promised to be a planar graph.

====Relation to complexity classes====
Promise problems provide an alternate definition for standard complexity classes of decision problems. P, for instance, can be defined as a promise problem:
: P is the class of promise problems that are solvable in deterministic polynomial time. That is, the promise problem formula_214 is in P if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm formula_10 such that:
:* For every formula_233
:* For ever formula_234

Classes of decision problems—that is, classes of problems defined as formal languages—thus translate naturally to promise problems, where a language formula_37 in the class is simply formula_236 and formula_222 is implicitly formula_227.

Formulating many basic complexity classes like P as promise problems provides little additional insight into their nature. However, there are some complexity classes for which formulating them as promise problems have been useful to computer scientists. Promise problems have, for instance, played a key role in the study of SZK (statistical zero-knowledge).

==Summary of relationships between complexity classes==
The following table shows some of the classes of problems that are considered in complexity theory. If class X is a strict subset of Y, then X is shown below Y with a dark line connecting them. If X is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and dotted. Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of computability theory, but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Aizumi has been growing rapidly since the 1960s. With a population growth rate of 10% over the past 10 years, it is one of the most developed towns in Tokushima Prefecture.

== History ==
As with all of Tokushima Prefecture, the area of Aizumi was part of ancient Awa Province. From the Muromachi period, Shōzui Castle was the seat of the Hosokawa clan and later the Miyoshi clan who ruled as &quot;shugo&quot; of the province. Chōsokabe Motochika seized control of the province in the Sengoku period and Shōzui Castle fell into ruins. He was subsequently defected by the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Tokushima Domain ruled by the Hachisuka clan from their seat at Tokushima Castle, and Aizumi became an agricultural area noted for its production of indigo. The villages of Aizono (藍園村) and Sumiyoshi (住吉村) were established within Itano District, Tokushima with the creation of the modern municipalities&#x27; system on October 1, 1889. The two village merged on April 29, 1955, to form the town of Aizumi.

==Government==
Aizumi has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 16 members. Aizumi, together with the other municipalities of Itano District, contributes four members to the Tokushima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Tokushima 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Aizumi has a mixed economy of agriculture and light manufacturing. The production of indigo dye and miso fermented bean paste are traditional local industries. Due to its geographical location and abundance of flat land for housing development, Aizumi is also developing into a commuter town for neighboring Tokushima.

<doc id="502435" wikidata="Q1352586" url="?curid=502435" title="Lavinium">
<text>Lavinium was a port city of Latium, to the south of Rome, midway between the Tiber river at Ostia and Antium. The coastline then, as now, was a long strip of beach. Lavinium was on a hill at the southernmost edge of the &quot;Silva Laurentina&quot;, a dense laurel forest, and the northernmost edge of the Pontine Marshes, a vast malarial tract of wetlands. The basis for the port, the only one between Ostia and Antium, was evidently the mouth of the Numicus river.

The location of Lavinium has never been lost to historians nor does there appear to have been any significant break in its habitation. Today&#x27;s settlement remains a walled village of medieval design, Pratica di Mare, in the &quot;comune&quot; of Pomezia. The latter is a city constructed in 1939 and settled according to a plan of Benito Mussolini, whose engineers completed the millennia-long task of draining and filling the marsh, now the Pontine fields. A brief strip of field separates the large and flourishing city from the village. One Roman gate allows entry into the narrow streets of the village past the Castello Borghese, originally a fortification, purchased along with the village in 1617 by Marcantonio Borghese. The castle and the village were periodically renovated. All that remains of the river that once partly surrounded the village is a small stream, the Fosso di Pratica.

Pratica di Mare is about from the Tyrrhenian Sea near the top of a slope descending to an alluvial shelf on which the Pratica di Mare Air Force Base has been placed. It has the historical distinction of being the airfield from which Otto Skorzeny flew Mussolini to safety in Germany after his rescue from imprisonment in a mountain villa. Today the base is both a secure airport for the protection of distinguished visitors to the Rome region and a home for air shows of advanced aircraft. The Fosso di Pratica was re-routed around the end of a runway; however, today&#x27;s small brook is in no way compatible with the concept of a port. The sea may well have formerly extended up to the base of the hill, as sites further north, such as Ostia, appear to have retreated one or two miles inland. Ancient Roman seaside villas are no longer on the beach.

==Archaeology==
Pratica di Mare is observably smaller than ancient Lavinium, whose remains crop out in the surrounding fields. Recent archaeological excavations performed to the south date Lavinium to well before the legendary foundation of Rome. It was already fortified in the 7th century BC and flourishing in the 6th. Lavinium was assimilated by Republican Rome. It was connected to Rome in the north and Ardea to the south by the Via Laurentina. Under the empire it was combined with the mysterious Laurentum, where many wealthy Romans maintained a winter villa, to become &quot;Laurolavinium&quot;. The nature of the union remains ambiguous.

A number of kilns have been identified within the perimeter of the city walls. Outside the city was a sanctuary dedicated to Sol Indiges and a vast sanctuary with numerous altars, where the bronze inscribed plaque records that the Dioscuri were being venerated at one of numerous altars.

==Legend and history==
According to Roman mythology, which links Lavinium more securely to Rome, the city was named by Aeneas in honor of Lavinia, daughter of Latinus, king of the Latins, and his wife, Amata. Aeneas reached Italy and there fought a war against Turnus, the leader of the local Rutuli people. Aeneas founded not Rome but rather Lavinium, the main centre of the Latin league, from which the people of Rome sprang. Aeneas thus links the royal house of Troy with the early Roman royal house.

The foundation of Lavinium and the Rutulian war are both mentioned prominently in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;.
In ancient times Lavinium had a close association with the nearby Laurentum. According to Livy, in the eighth century BC, when Romulus and Titus Tatius jointly ruled Rome, the ambassadors of the Laurentes came to Rome, but were beaten by Tatius&#x27; relatives. The Laurentes complained, but Tatius accorded more weight to the influence of his relatives than to the injury done the Laurentes. When Tatius afterwards visited Lavinium to celebrate an anniversary sacrifice, he was slain in a tumult. Romulus declined to go to war and instead renewed the treaty between Rome and Lavinium.

In 509 BC, after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, one of Rome&#x27;s first two consuls Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus was coerced into leaving Rome because of his relation to the kings. He voluntarily went into exile in Lavinium.

In around 488 BC, Lavinium was captured by an invading army of the Volsci, led by Gaius Marcius Coriolanus and Attius Tullus Aufidius.

<text>Clyde Roark Hoey (December 11, 1877May 12, 1954) was an American Democratic politician from North Carolina. He served in both houses of the state legislature and served briefly in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1919 to 1921. He was North Carolina&#x27;s governor from 1937 to 1941. He entered the U.S. Senate in 1945 and served there until his death in 1954, only days before the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision. He was a segregationist.

== Biography ==
Hoey (HOO-ee) was born to Captain Samuel Alberta Hoey, a Confederate States Army officer, and Mary Charlotte Roark. He attended school until age eleven. He worked on his family&#x27;s farm and bought a weekly newspaper when he was 16. He was elected to the state legislature when he was twenty. He served as a state representative and then as a state senator. He was elected in a special election to the United States House of Representatives to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Edwin Y. Webb who had accepted a federal judgeship. He defeated a Republican who opposed United States support for the League of Nations. He served from 1919 to 1921. He prosecuted the leaders of the 1929 Loray Mill strike for the murder of the Gastonia police chief.

He was the 59th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1937 to 1941. In July 1937, he pardoned Luke Lea, a Tennessee politician and former U.S. senator, who had been paroled a year earlier. His appointment of a black man to the board of trustees of a black college set a precedent. Following the 1938 &quot;Gaines&quot; Supreme Court decision on racial segregation in higher education, he asked the North Carolina legislature to provide for segregated higher education for blacks. Though opposed to integrated education, he said that the people of the state &quot;do believe in equality of opportunity in their respective fields of service&quot; and that &quot;the white race cannot afford to do less than simple justice to the Negro.&quot;

In 1940, Hoey quietly opposed a third term for FDR. When he believed that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would not seek a third term, Hoey rejected the favorite son role for which the state legislature had recommended him and supported the presidential candidacy of Secretary of State Cordell Hull.

Hoey won election to the U.S. Senate in 1944. He served from 1945 until his death in 1954.

Hoey&#x27;s politics were those of a conservative Democrat. He opposed Harry S. Truman&#x27;s attempt to make the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) permanent. He promised to filibuster the effort as an attack on &quot;the rights of every businessman in America.&quot; He supported the President&#x27;s threats against striking railroad workers in December 1946. In the 1948 election, he supported Truman over the alternative, Strom Thurmond.

He supported President Truman&#x27;s refusal to allow Congress access to records of government employees&#x27; loyalty investigations.

In 1950, Hoey opposed statehood for Hawaii because he thought it &quot;inconceivable&quot; to allow a territory with &quot;only a small percentage of white people&quot; to become a state. He advocated independence for Hawaii and cited U.S. treatment of Cuba and the Philippines as precedents.

From 1949 to 1952 he headed the Investigations Subcommittee of the Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments. He conducted hearings into the role of &quot;five percenters&quot;, government influence peddlers. In 1950 he chaired an investigation that resulted in a report, known as the Hoey Report, released in December of that year that said all of the government&#x27;s intelligence agencies &quot;are in complete agreement that sex perverts [meaning, primarily, gay men] in Government constitute security risks.&quot; Douglas Charles characterizes Hoey&#x27;s involvement in the committee as reluctant, due to fears that the issue could become hyperbolic, leaving chief counsel Francis Flanagan as the actual driving force behind the Hoey Report The 1957 Crittenden Report, a review by the U.S. Navy, criticized it: &quot;No intelligence agency, as far as can be learned, adduced any factual data before that committee with which to support these opinions.&quot;

Hoey married Bessie Gardner, sister of North Carolina Governor O. Max Gardner. They had three children. His wife died in 1942. He was a lifelong member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and taught Sunday school classes. He was also a member of the Freemasons, Odd Fellows, Woodmen of the World, and the Knights of Pythias.

Hoey died at his desk in his Washington, D.C., office. Sam Ervin was appointed to his seat in June 1954.

==Legacy==
In 1974, journalist Jonathan Daniels assessed Hoey&#x27;s politics as &quot;always satisfactory to conservative interests without being abrasive to New Dealers.&quot;

Three university buildings in North Carolina were named for Hoey, but have been renamed. The first renaming was in July 2019, when, given Hoey&#x27;s history of segregationist advocacy and use of racist language in a public address, his name was removed from North Carolina Central University&#x27;s administration building and replaced with that of the university&#x27;s African-American founder, James E. Shepard. Hoey Hall, a dormitory at Appalachian State University, and Hoey Auditorium, on the campus of Western Carolina University , were renamed in June 2020, as part of the name changes due to the George Floyd protests. According to a unanimous vote of the trustees of Western Carolina, &quot;Hoey&#x27;s espoused racist views are contrary to this university&#x27;s core values of diversity and equality.&quot;

<text>John Christoph Blucher Ehringhaus (February 5, 1882July 31, 1949) was an American politician who served as the 58th governor of North Carolina, serving from 1933 to 1937.

==Biography==
He was born on February 5, 1882, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. He was a descendent of German immigrant Johann Christoph Ehringhaus, who arrived in North Carolina in the early nineteenth-century and opened a bank in Elizabeth City. The Ehringhaus family remained involved in banking and law in Elizabeth City for generations.

Ehringhaus attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he was a member of the Philanthropic society of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies from 1898 to 1902.

Ehringhaus was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (BPOE), Elizabeth City Lodge #856. He served as District Deputy Grand Exalted Ruler for the North Carolina East District of the BPOE, 1909-1910.

Governor O. Max Gardner coaxed Ehringhaus, a former state legislator and attorney, out of political retirement as his hand-picked successor. He narrowly defeated Lieutenant Governor Richard T. Fountain in a Democratic primary runoff. Fountain claimed Ehringhaus was the tool of business interests.

Serving the state during the Great Depression, Ehringhaus encouraged the North Carolina General Assembly to create a state agency that would help rural areas of the state receive electricity services in order to revive the lagging economy. He also cut state spending, successfully pushed for a three-cent sales tax, extended the school year and kept the schools open and solvent.

He appointed former North Carolinian first lady Cora Lily Woodard Aycock as the President of the North Carolina Railroad.

He died on July 31, 1949.

==Legacy==
Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; &quot;My name is pronounced as if spelled &quot;ear&#x27;en-house&quot;.&quot;

A dormitory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ehringhaus&#x27; alma mater (class of 1902) is named in his honor, and the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, of which Ehringhaus was a member, maintains a portrait in his honor.

The second longest bridge in the state of North Carolina, a 3.5-mile stretch over the Albemarle Sound, is named in honor of this former governor.

Ehringhaus&#x27; grave is located in the historic Episcopal Cemetery in his hometown of Elizabeth City in Northeastern North Carolina, and the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare, Ehringhaus Street, is named in his honor.

<text>The Chungbuk Line () is a railway line serving North Chungcheong Province in South Korea. The line connects Jochiwon on the Gyeongbu Line to Bongyang on the Jungang Line, serving the major cities of Cheongju and Chungju &quot;en route.&quot; Cheongju International Airport is located near the rail line.

== History ==
=== Prewar ===
The first section of the line was opened by the privately owned Chōsen Central Railway in 1921, which became part of the Chōsen Railway (&quot;Chōtetsu&quot;) in 1923. Chōtetsu then continued to extend the line until 1928 to Chungju as follows:
Plans existed to continue the line from Chungju to Yeongwol, but after the end of Japanese rule this plan was abandoned until 1949, after which the extension was built as the Korean National Railroad&#x27;s Taebaek Line.

In the November 1942 timetable, the last issued prior to the start of the Pacific War, Chōtetsu operated the following schedule of local passenger services (&quot;R&quot; indicates that train was operated by railcar):

=== Postwar === 
Like the other private railways this line was also nationalized after the independence of Korea. The rest section of the line was opened on January 10, 1959.

=== Upgrade ===
The double-track construction began on October 20, 1975, and on October 17, 1980, 113.2 km between Jochiwon and Bongyang was double-tracked. During the double-track construction, some sections were relocated. The entire line was electrified on 30 March 2005.

On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Chungbuk Line is to be upgraded for 230 km/h and may see KTX service. 

The movie &quot;Peppermint Candy&quot; was shot near Gongjeon station.

Outside of their careers, they were each well known for their serial matrimony: Magda was married six times; Zsa Zsa nine times; and Eva five times. British actor George Sanders was first married to Zsa Zsa and later to Magda, though the latter marriage only lasted one month.

==History==

The Gabor sisters were born into a family of Hungarian-Jewish background, in Budapest, Hungary to parents Vilmos and Jolie Gabor. The family moved to New York in the wake of World War II. Magda had played a small role in a Hungarian film before the war, so Jolie and her three daughters moved to Hollywood to break into the film business. Eva was the first of the sisters to immigrate to the US, shortly after her first marriage, to a Swedish osteopath, Dr. Eric Drimmer, whom she married in 1937 when she was 18 years old.

In 1953, Eva was given her own television talk show, &quot;The Eva Gabor Show&quot;, which ran for one season (1953–54). Both of her sisters appeared on the show in guest spots. From September 1965 through April 1971, Eva starred in the CBS sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot;, which proved to be a ratings success.

Zsa Zsa&#x27;s only child, Francesca Hilton, was born on March 10, 1947, by then-husband Conrad Hilton. Zsa Zsa was the only Gabor sister to have a child. Francesca Hilton died on January 5, 2015, at the age of 67, from an apparent stroke or heart attack. She had no children.

===Widespread fame===
The sisters were well-known socialites, with Eva and Zsa Zsa becoming notable for their acting and personality work. Both sisters had recurring roles on hit series such as &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and &quot;The Matinee Theater&quot;, at separate times, and appeared as themselves regularly on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. In his autobiography, television host Merv Griffin, who was known to spend time with Eva socially, wrote of the Gabor sisters&#x27; initial presence in New York and Los Angeles:

All these years later, it&#x27;s hard to describe the phenomenon of the three glamorous Gabor girls and their ubiquitous mother. They burst onto the society pages and into the gossip columns so suddenly, and with such force, it was as if they&#x27;d been dropped out of the sky.
==Deaths==
The youngest sister, Eva predeceased her elder sisters and her mother. Eva died in Los Angeles on July 4, 1995, from respiratory failure and pneumonia, following a fall in a bathtub in Mexico, where she had been on vacation. Her funeral was held on July 11, 1995, at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Beverly Hills.

Their mother, Jolie, was apparently never told of Eva&#x27;s death and died less than two years later, in Palm Springs, California, of natural causes on April 1, 1997, at age 100. The cause of death was declared as kidney failure. Two months after Jolie&#x27;s death, Magda died on June 6, 1997, five days before her 82nd birthday. 

Francesca Hilton, Zsa Zsa&#x27;s daughter, died in 2015. Zsa Zsa was reportedly never told of her daughter&#x27;s death. Zsa Zsa died at the age of 99 of cardiac arrest while in a coma at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on December 18, 2016, 50 days shy of becoming a centenarian. The causes of death were given as &quot;Cardiopulmonary arrest, Coronary Artery Disease, and Cerebral Vascular Disease&quot;. She had been on life support for the previous five years.

<text>Oliver Max Gardner (March 22, 1882February 6, 1947) was an American politician who served as the 57th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1929 to 1933. A member of the Democratic Party, Gardner worked in the administrations of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.

==Early years and education==
Gardner was born on March 22, 1882, in Shelby, North Carolina, orphaned at a young age. He attended North Carolina State University (then known as North Carolina A &amp; M) on a scholarship, where he majored in chemical engineering, was involved in ROTC, played on the football team, managed the baseball team, served as the senior class president, and maintained active membership in Sigma Nu fraternity. Gardner was selected by John Heisman, then coach at Clemson for his All-Southern team in 1903. As a player, he weighed 212 pounds. He later taught organic chemistry on campus after graduating in 1903. He then enrolled at the University of North Carolina School of Law, where he also played football. Gardner distinguished himself off the football field as well, becoming one of the most respected members of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Gardner was the only person ever to captain the football teams of both the North Carolina Tar Heels and the NC State Wolfpack.

==Political career==
Gardner returned to Shelby to practice law and married Fay Webb, daughter of prominent politician James L. Webb and niece of Congressman Edwin Y. Webb.

Gardner was elected as a state senator from Cleveland County, North Carolina and served one term as President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate. He served a term as the 13th Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina (1917–1921). In 1920, he lost the Democratic nomination for governor to Cameron Morrison. The election was likely stolen by the political machine of U.S. Sen. Furnifold Simmons, who, through his lieutenant, A. D. Watts, used racial demagoguery and electoral fraud to favor their candidate, Morrison. Gardner led in the initial vote count, but after several days of counting, more votes for Morrison were &quot;found&quot; in western North Carolina, and Morrison won the June primary by 87 votes. Gardner lost the runoff to Morrison by a wider margin.

Gardner made peace with Sen. Simmons. He agreed to support Simmons&#x27;s favored candidate for governor in 1924, Angus Wilton McLean, in exchange for Simmons supporting Gardner when he ran for governor again in 1928. While Gardner was out of politics, he pursued business interests, including a textile mill.

==Governor==
Easily elected governor in 1928, Gardner assumed control over a state that was in debt and soon had to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Gardner commissioned a report by the Brookings Institution on how to cut costs in government and cut local property taxes. Gardner pushed many of the Brookings recommendations through the legislature, including taking over financial responsibility for roads and schools from counties and the creation of what would become the consolidated University of North Carolina system. He reorganized and reformed the state government.

Meanwhile, Gardner took a pro-business, anti-union stance in a period of labor unrest, including the Loray Mill Strike. He did, however, push through the legislature a workman&#x27;s compensation law and successfully mediated a massive 1932 strike of mill workers in the Greensboro–High Point area.

==Later years==
After leaving the governor&#x27;s mansion (governors of the state were then barred from seeking re-election), Gardner practiced law and lobbied in Washington, D.C. He was an informal advisor and speech-writer for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who appointed him chairman of the advisory board to the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, and later a member of the Joint Anglo-American Commission on Palestine.

President Harry S. Truman appointed him Under Secretary of the Treasury (1946–47). In 1947, Gardner was appointed by Truman to be ambassador to the United Kingdom. Though, prior to ever arriving in London, Gardner died of Coronary thrombosis at The St. Regis Hotel in New York City on February 6, 1947.

==Legacy==

Gardner founded the influential &quot;Shelby Dynasty&quot; or &quot;Cleveland Dynasty&quot; of politicians, which included Governor Clyde Hoey, the husband of his sister, Margaret Gardner Hoey. The pro-business organization controlled the North Carolina Democratic Party, and therefore, state politics, until 1948.

Gardner–Webb University is named for Gardner and his wife, Fay Webb-Gardner. The Fine Arts building at Gardner–Webb University is named for him as well. Gardner Hall, a dormitory at Appalachian State University, is also named for him, as is the economics building at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as is one of the biology buildings at North Carolina State University. The O. Max Gardner Award was established in his will to recognize University of North Carolina system faculty who have &quot;made the greatest contributions to the welfare of the human race.&quot; It is the only award for which all faculty members of the 16 UNC campuses are eligible and is considered the UNC system&#x27;s highest faculty honor.

His home at Shelby, Webbley, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

<doc id="502447" wikidata="Q1144618" url="?curid=502447" title="Familial Mediterranean fever">
<text>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary inflammatory disorder. FMF is an autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene, which encodes a 781–amino acid protein called pyrin. While all ethnic groups are susceptible to FMF, it usually occurs in people of Mediterranean origin—including Sephardic Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Ashkenazi Jews, Assyrians, Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Druze, Levantines, Kurds, Greeks, Turks and Italians.

The disorder has been given various names, including familial paroxysmal polyserositis, periodic peritonitis, recurrent polyserositis, benign paroxysmal peritonitis, periodic disease or periodic fever, Reimann periodic disease or Reimann syndrome, Siegal-Cattan-Mamou disease, and Wolff periodic disease. Note that &quot;periodic fever&quot; can also refer to any of the periodic fever syndromes.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Attacks===
There are seven types of attacks. Ninety percent of all patients have their first attack before they are eighteen years old. All develop over two to four hours and last anywhere from six hours to five days. Most attacks involve fever.

# Abdominal attacks, featuring abdominal pain, affect the whole abdomen with all signs of peritonitis (inflammation of abdominal lining), and acute abdominal pain like appendicitis. They occur in 95 percent of all patients and may lead to unnecessary laparotomy. Incomplete attacks, with local tenderness and normal blood tests, have been reported.
# Joint attacks mainly occur in large joints, especially in the legs. Usually, only one joint is affected. Seventy-five percent of all FMF patients experience joint attacks.
# Chest attacks include pleuritis (inflammation of the pleura) and pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium). Pleuritis occurs in 40 percent of patients and makes it difficult to breathe or lie flat, but pericarditis is rare.
# Scrotal attacks due to inflammation of the tunica vaginalis are somewhat rare but may be mistaken for testicular torsion.
# Myalgia (rare in isolation)
# Erysipeloid rashes (a skin reaction on the legs that can mimic cellulitis, rare in isolation)

===Diagnostic criteria===
Various diagnostic criteria have been set, but the Tel-Hashomer clinical criteria are widely recognized. It has more than 95 percent and 97 percent sensitivity and specificity, respectively.

For the criteria, typical attacks consist of all the following: recurrent (three or more episodes), febrile (rectal temperature of at least 38 °C), painful inflammation, and a short duration of 12 to 72 hours.

Incomplete attacks (must be recurrent) differ from typical attacks in at least one feature as follows: temperature less than 38 °C, attack duration longer or shorter than specified (but no less than six hours and no more than seven days), localized abdominal attacks, no signs of peritonitis during the attacks, and arthritis in a location other than the hip, knee or ankle.

===Complications===
AA-amyloidosis with kidney failure may develop without overt crises. AA amyloid protein is produced in very large quantities during attacks and at a low rate between them, accumulating mainly in the kidney, heart, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, and thyroid.

There appears to be an increased risk of certain vasculitis-related diseases (e.g., Henoch–Schönlein purpura, polyarteritis nodosa, and Behçet&#x27;s disease), spondylarthropathy, prolonged arthritis of certain joints, and protracted myalgia.

==Genetics==

The &quot;MEFV&quot; gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p13). Many different mutations of the &quot;MEFV&quot; gene can cause the disorder. Having one mutation is unlikely to cause the condition. Having two mutations (either a copy from both parents or two different mutations with one from each parent) is the threshold for a genetic diagnosis of FMF. However, most individuals who comply with the genetic diagnosis of FMF remain asymptomatic or undiagnosed. Whether this is due to modifier genes or environmental factors remains to be established.

==Pathophysiology==
Virtually all cases are due to a mutation in the &quot;Mediterranean Fever (MEFV)&quot; gene on the chromosome 16, which codes for a protein called &quot;pyrin&quot; or &quot;marenostrin&quot;. Various mutations of this gene lead to FMF, although some mutations cause a more severe picture than others. Mutations occur mainly in exons 2, 3, 5 and 10.

The function of pyrin is not fully known, but in short, it is a protein that binds to the adaptor ASC and the proform of the enzyme caspase-1 to generate multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes in response to certain infections. In healthy individuals, pyrin-mediated inflammasome assembly (which leads to the caspase 1) dependent processing and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-1β) is a response to enterotoxins from certain bacteria. The gain-of-function mutations in the MEFV gene cause pyrin more active in the body, which increases inflammasome formation. 

In its basal state, pyrin is kept inactive by a chaperone protein (belonging to the family of 14.3.3 proteins) linked to pyrin through phosphorylated serine residues. The dephosphorylation of pyrin is an essential prerequisite for the activation of the pyrin inflammasome. Inactivation of RhoA GTPases (by bacterial toxins, for example) leads to the inactivation of PKN1 / PKN2 kinases and dephosphorylation of pyrin. In healthy subjects, the dephosphorylation step alone does not cause activation of the pyrin inflammasome. In contrast, in FMF patients, the dephosphorylation of serines is sufficient to trigger the activation of the pyrin inflammasome. This suggests that there is a two-level regulation and that the second regulatory mechanism (independent of (de)phosphorylation) is deficient in FMF patients. This deficient mechanism is probably located at the level of the B30.2 domain (exon 10) where most of the pathogenic mutations associated with FMF are located. It is probably the interaction of this domain with the cytoskeleton (microtubules) that is failing, as suggested by the efficacy of colchicine.

It is not conclusively known what exactly sets off the attacks or why overproduction of IL-1 would lead to particular symptoms in particular organs, such as joints or the peritoneal cavity. However, steroid hormone catabolites (pregnanolone and etiocholanolone) have been shown to activate the pyrin inflammasome in vitro by interacting with the B30.2 domain (coded by exon 10).

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is clinically made based on the history of typical attacks, especially in patients from the ethnic groups in which FMF is more highly prevalent. An acute phase response is present during attacks, with high C-reactive protein levels, an elevated white blood cell count, and other markers of inflammation. In patients with a long history of attacks, monitoring the kidney function is of importance in predicting chronic kidney failure.

A genetic test is also available to detect mutations in the &quot;MEFV&quot; gene. Sequencing of exons 2, 3, 5, and 10 of this gene detects an estimated 97% of all known mutations.

A specific and highly sensitive test for FMF is the &quot;metaraminol provocative test (MPT)&quot;, whereby a single 10 mg infusion of metaraminol is administered to the patient. A positive diagnosis is made if the patient presents with a typical, albeit milder, FMF attack within 48 hours. As MPT is more specific than sensitive, it does not identify all cases of FMF, although a positive MPT can be useful.

==Treatment==
Attacks are self-limiting, and require analgesia and NSAIDs (such as diclofenac). Colchicine, a drug otherwise mainly used in gout, decreases attack frequency in FMF patients. The exact way in which colchicine suppresses attacks is unclear. While this agent is not without side effects (such as abdominal pain and muscle pains), it may markedly improve the quality of life in patients. The dosage is typically 1–2 mg a day. Development of amyloidosis is delayed with colchicine treatment. Interferon is being studied as a therapeutic modality. Some advise discontinuation of colchicine before and during pregnancy, but the data are inconsistent, and others feel it is safe to take colchicine during pregnancy.

Approximately 5–10% of FMF cases are resistant to colchicine therapy alone. In these cases, adding anakinra to the daily colchicine regimen has been successful. Canakinumab, an anti-interleukin-1-beta monoclonal antibody, has likewise been shown to be effective in controlling and preventing flare-ups in patients with colchicine-resistant FMF and in two additional autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes: mevolonate kinase deficiency (hyper-immunoglobulin D syndrome, or HIDS) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS).

==Epidemiology==
FMF affects groups of people originating in the Levant or Eastern Mediterranean (hence its name); it is thus most prominent among those from or with ancestry from the regions including Arabs, Armenians, Jews (particularly Sephardi, Mizrahi, and to a lesser degree Ashkenazi Jews), and Turks.

==History==
A New York City allergist, Sheppard Siegal, first described the attacks of peritonitis in 1945; he termed this &quot;benign paroxysmal peritonitis&quot;, as the disease course was essentially benign. Dr Hobart Reimann, working in the American University in Beirut, described a more complete picture which he termed &quot;periodic disease&quot;. French physicians Henry Mamou and Roger Cattan described the complete disease with renal complications in 1952.

<text>Angus Wilton McLean (April 20, 1870June 21, 1935) was an American lawyer and banker who was the 56th governor of North Carolina, serving from 1925 to 1929. McLean also served as Assistant Secretary of the United States Department of the Treasury from 1920 to 1921.

==Biography==
Born in Maxton, North Carolina the son of Archibald Alexander and Caroline Amanda Purcell McLean, he is a descendant of a proud line of hardy Scots who settled in the Upper Cape Fear Valley. He was educated at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned a law degree in 1892. McLean first entered politics in 1892, serving as the chairman of the Robeson County Democratic Executive Committee. A supporter of Woodrow Wilson, he was a delegate to Democratic National Conventions and sat on the Democratic National Committee. From 1918 to 1922 he served on the War Finance Corporation board, and from 1920 to 1921 he was the assistant secretary of the Treasury.

McLean secured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1924 by defeating Josiah W. Bailey. During his tenure, an executive budget system was initiated; a department of conservation and development was established; and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was formed. Governor McLean also helped streamlined North Carolina&#x27;s economy, which led to a $2.5 million state budget surplus that his successor Oliver Gardner claimed later helped the state survive the Great Depression. After completing his term, McLean retired from political life.

He died on June 21, 1935, in Washington, D.C. Death was attributed to a blood clot in his right lung. He had been ill for several weeks.

==Legacy==
His son, Hector (1920–2012), became a bank president and state senator.

The McLean family of Robeson county, origins are well documented and integrated in the larger narrative of the region. Through marriage and direct relations Angus Wilton McLean is related to the following individuals:
* Malcom McLean, Trucking Tycoon and &quot;Father of the Intermodal Shipping container&quot;
* Flora MacDonald, &quot;Scottish Heroine&quot;
* &quot;Devil John&quot; Bethea, &quot;South Carolina Revolutionary War Hero&quot;
* Virgil Goode, Member of US House of Representatives from Virginia&#x27;s 5th District

<text>Beckett on Film was a project aimed at making film versions of all nineteen of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s stage plays, with the exception of the early and unperformed &quot;Eleutheria&quot;. This endeavour was successfully completed, with the first films being shown in 2001.

The project was conceived by Michael Colgan, artistic director of Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre. The films were produced by Colgan and Alan Moloney for the Irish broadcaster RTÉ, the British broadcaster Channel 4 and the Irish Film Board. Each had a different cast and director, drawn from theatre, film and other fields.

Ten of the films were screened at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival and some shown on Channel 4 television. On Wednesday, 6 February 2002, the series won the Best TV Drama award at the 6th The South Bank Show Award at the Savoy Theatre in London. The films never enjoyed a general cinematic release, but, in September 2001, all nineteen were screened at the Barbican Centre in London. They were also released in a number of videos and as a four-DVD box set, comprising a souvenir programme and numerous additional features.

A documentary video, titled &quot;Check the Gate: Putting Beckett on Film&quot; and directed by Pearse Lehane, was released on 5 February 2003. It followed closely the project&#x27;s work.

== Credits ==
=== &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; ===
The play was originally published in 1952. Of directing the film version, Michael Lindsay-Hogg said, &quot;Beckett creates an amazing blend of comedy, high wit and an almost unbearable poignancy in a funny yet heartbreaking image of man&#x27;s fate. With the camera, you can pick those moments and emphasise them, making Beckett&#x27;s rare and extraordinary words all the more intimate [...]. The play is about what it is about. Samuel Beckett would have said it&#x27;s about two men waiting on the side of the road for someone to turn up. But you can invest in the importance of who is going to turn up. Is it a local farmer? Is it God? Is it salvation? Or is it simply someone who just doesn&#x27;t show up?

&quot;The important thing is the ambiguity, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really state what it is. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so great for the audience to be part of it: they fill in a lot of the blanks; it works in their imaginations.

&quot;For me, Beckett&#x27;s view of the world is quite sadly accurate. We are all really just bugs in the carpet.&quot;

<text>Thomas Walter Bickett (February 28, 1869December 28, 1921) was the 54th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1917 to 1921. He was born in Monroe, North Carolina.

Bickett was a graduate of Wake Forest College. Prior to being elected Governor, Bickett practiced law in Louisburg, represented Franklin County in the North Carolina General Assembly and then served as North Carolina Attorney General for two terms (1909–1917).

On November 29, 1898, he married Fanny Neal Yarborough of Rose Hill Plantation.

In 1916, Bickett became the first state governor who was nominated by means of a Democratic Party primary election (in which he defeated Lt. Gov. Elijah L. Daughtridge). Under Bickett&#x27;s leadership, various reforms were implemented including improvements in child welfare, public health, electricity, and running water. He also persuaded the legislature to establish the state&#x27;s first income tax. He also had to lead the state through World War I.

Walter Bickett Elementary in Monroe, North Carolina (where he was born), is named for him. Two school locations have his name. The original Walter Bickett School opened in March 1922 on Lancaster Avenue as Monroe High School, the city&#x27;s first high school, and was named &quot;sometime later&quot; for Bickett. It remained a high school until the present Monroe High School was built in 1960, and was replaced in 2003 with a new Walter Bickett Elementary. The older building became Walter Bickett Pre-K Education Center.

<doc id="502470" wikidata="Q331294" url="?curid=502470" title="John Armstrong Sr.">
<text>John Armstrong (October 13, 1717March 9, 1795) was an American civil engineer and soldier who served as a brigadier general in the Continental Army and as a major general in the Pennsylvania Militia during the Revolutionary War. He was also a delegate to the Continental Congress for Pennsylvania. Armstrong County, Pennsylvania is named in his honor.

== Early life==
Armstrong was born on October 13, 1717, in Brookeborough, County Fermanagh, Ireland, parents not determined, who married in 1704. He was one of approximately 15 children born to his parents that included: Margaret Armstrong (1737–1817), who married Rev. George Duffield (1732–1790), and Rebecca Armstrong (1738–1828), who married James Turner (1737–1803).

John was educated in Ireland and became a civil engineer before emigrating to Pennsylvania, with his brother-in-law, John Lyon, around 1740.

==Career==
Armstrong came to Pennsylvania as a surveyor for the Penn family, the proprietary owners of the colony. In 1750, he laid out the first plat or plan for the town of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and was one of its first settlers. He was later appointed surveyor for the newly established Cumberland County.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

In 1756, he led the Kittanning Expedition. In 1758, Colonel Armstrong led 2,700 Pennsylvania provincial troops on the Forbes expedition, the approach of which compelled the French to vacate and blow up Fort Duquesne. Armstrong became a good friend to the other militia commander in this expedition, Colonel George Washington.

James Smith wrote that in the fall of 1763, &quot;I went on the Susquehannah campaign, against the Indians, under the command of General Armstrong. In this route we burnt the Delaware and Monsey towns, on the West Branch of the Susquehannah, and destroyed all their corn.&quot;

=== American Revolution===

In the early stages of the American Revolutionary War, Armstrong was a brigadier general in the Pennsylvania militia. On March 1, 1776, the Continental Congress appointed him to that same rank in the Continental Army. He was sent south to begin preparations for the defense of Charleston, South Carolina. He contributed his engineering talents to the construction of defenses that enabled them to withstand the Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island later that year. When General Charles Lee arrived to take command, he returned to his duties with the main army and with the Pennsylvania militia. Pennsylvania named him major general in charge of the state militia. This ended his service in the Continental Army, but not the war or his cooperation with General George Washington.

At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Armstrong&#x27;s militia held the far left of the American line. They were also to guard the army&#x27;s supplies. After a hard day&#x27;s fighting the Americans were forced to withdraw or face being surrounded. Armstrong brought the supplies and his militia out from Pyle&#x27;s Ford after dark.

In the Battle of Germantown on October 4, General Armstrong led the American right. His mission was to skirt the British left flank and attack there and in their rear. Despite delays and the troubles some units had in moving, the overall attack was going well, until the center was held up at the Benjamin Chew House. The attack then collapsed after a friendly fire incident in the fog in which General Adam Stephen&#x27;s men fired on Anthony Wayne&#x27;s troops causing their withdrawal. Armstrong, whose men had advanced nearly to the center of Germantown, but were not greatly involved in the fight later complained that it was &quot;...a glorious victory fought for and eight tenths won, ...mysteriously lost, for to this moment no one man can ...give any good reason for the flight.&quot;

After Germantown, Armstrong was granted permission to give up active command. At aged sixty, his health was declining, and old wounds were troubling him. He served until April 4, 1778.

=== Later life===
After his service in the War ended, Armstrong returned home to Carlisle, where he was elected to the Continental Congress by the Pennsylvania Assembly. As a delegate from 1779 to 1780, he was a strong supporter of Washington and the army. Armstrong was firm in his support for a new United States Constitution, and was returned to the Congress of the Confederation during its final days in 1787 and 1788.

Throughout his life Armstrong served in a number of local or civic offices. One of these, the Carlisle school board, led him to originally oppose Dr. Benjamin Rush&#x27;s proposal to start a college in the town. He later relented, and became a member of the first Board of Trustees for Dickinson College from 1783 to 1794.

==Personal life==
In 1747, Armstrong was married to Rebecca Lyon Armstrong (1719–1797), daughter of Archibald Lyon and Ann Lyon. Together, they were the parents of:

* James Armstrong (1748–1828), who married Mary Stevenson (1766–1813), daughter of George Stevenson, Esq.
* John Armstrong Jr. (1758–1843), who married Alida Livingston (1761–1822), the sister of Robert R. Livingston and Edward Livingston.

John died at home in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1795, and is buried in the Old Carlisle Cemetery. In 1800, when Pennsylvania created a new county with its seat at Kittanning, it was named Armstrong County in his honor.

<text>Locke Craig (August 16, 1860 – June 9, 1924), an American lawyer and Democratic politician, was the 53rd governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina, serving from 1913 until 1917.

==Early and family life==

Craig was born near Windsor, North Carolina, on August 16, 1860, to Baptist minister and farmer Andrew Murdock Craig and his second wife Clarissa Rebecca Gilliam. He was named for the Scottish philosopher John Locke. His paternal ancestors had emigrated from Scotland before the American Revolutionary War. By 1870, his elder half-brothers William Craig (b. 1835), Clenzman Craig (b.1841) and Andrew Craig Jr. (b.1848) had left home, and he and his youngest brother Braxton Craig were away at school. Craig attended the Horner Military Academy in Granville County run by former Confederate officer James Horner. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1874, his mother sold the family farm and moved with the 15 year old Locke to Chapel Hill. He graduated from the University of North Carolina (also his late father&#x27;s alma mater in 1822) in 1880. Locke Craig taught chemistry at the university for one year, then studied law.

Craig married Annie Burgin (1873–1955) on November 18, 1892, in McDowell County, North Carolina. The couple had four sons: Capt. Carlyle Craig (1892–1971), George Winston Craig (1894–1985), Arthur Burgin Craig (1896– ) and Locke Craig (1914–1993). Two of the boys graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, and George Craig would become a lawyer and member of the North Carolina General Assembly.

==Career==

After admission to the North Carolina bar, Craig settled in Asheville in the state&#x27;s mountainous western region. He served as Buncombe County attorney and the Asheville city corporation counsel.

In the 1890s, Craig became active in the local Democratic Party and served as a Democratic elector in 1892 and 1896, canvassing the state for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. He became known as an orator, despite his small physical stature, and was nicknamed &quot;The Little Giant of the West&quot; in tribute to former Democratic presidential candidate Stephen A. Douglas.

At the time, the other major political party in the state was known as the &quot;Fusionists&quot;, a coalition of Populists and Republicans. The Fusionists won many offices in North Carolina in 1894, and controlled the state legislature in 1895 and 1897, as well as elected Republican Daniel L. Russell as the state&#x27;s Governor in 1896. The other major Democratic orator in North Carolina at the time was fellow lawyer Charles Brantley Aycock of Goldsboro, son of Confederate state senator and slaveowner Benjamin Aycock and U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina during the presidency of Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1893–1897. Although a strong supporter of education for blacks as well as whites, Aycock had refused to become the Fusionists&#x27; gubernatorial candidate in 1896. By 1898, Aycock and Craig were stressing white supremacy, enraged by the enlarged political role of African Americans in the Russell administration.

In 1899 Craig won election to the North Carolina House of Representatives and was re-elected in 1901. While a member of the North Carolina State House, Craig worked with Aycock on the state constitutional amendment that would effectively disfranchise African American voters. Aycock won election as North Carolina&#x27;s governor in 1900. Meanwhile, Craig twice failed in attempts at higher office, losing in a bid for his party&#x27;s nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1903 and in 1908 withdrew from his first run for the North Carolina governorship after three days of deadlock in the state&#x27;s Democratic convention between his supporters and those of William Walton Kitchin (the eventual winner) and Ashley Horne. Finally winning the Democratic nomination in 1912 (by acclimation), Craig also won the general election in another three-way race and became North Carolina&#x27;s governor, although his ally, former governor Aycock had died in April 1912 (suffering a heart attack while campaigning for the U.S. Senate seat).

During his time as governor, Craig continued Aycock&#x27;s educational reforms. He also presided over other reforms and formed the state&#x27;s first highway commission (5,000 miles of state-built roads in 1913 grew to 15,000 miles in 1917 and national recognition as the &quot;Good Roads State&quot;) as well as established many forestry and fishery conservation policies. Gratifying North Carolinians enraged at the clearcutting of the state&#x27;s forests by logging companies, Governor Craig and the legislature established Mount Mitchell State Park in 1915 (the state&#x27;s first state park). He also served on the Appalachian Parks Commission, which promoted creation of the Pisgah National Forest. He also acted decisively when floods ravaged western North Carolina in 1916. Implementing a campaign promise to reduce freight rates to the level of the rest of the South, and harnessing electric power by building dams on the Yadkin, Catawba, French Broad and Cape Fear Rivers spurred the state&#x27;s economic development. Craig also oversaw other improvements in western North Carolina. He also encouraged private contracts for prisoners to perform road and railroad labor, using a model which in 1880 had led to completion of the Western North Carolina Railroad to Swannanoa Gap (on the Buncombe/McDowell county line and the division between the Atlantic and Mississippi watersheds). After completing his term, Craig retired from public service and resumed his legal career.

==Death and legacy==
The former governor built a new house on the Swannanoa River in Asheville, but suffered a debilitating illness in 1917 and lived as an invalid during his final seven years. Locke Craig died at the age of 63 on June 9, 1924, survived by his wife Annie, sons and grandchildren. He was buried in the Riverside Cemetery in the Montford Area Historic District, in Asheville, North Carolina, where Annie joined him 30 years later. His eldest son Carlyle had a military career, including service in World War II, and his second son George followed his father&#x27;s path in law and politics through the mid-1950s. His youngest son, Locke Craig Jr., became a forester.

In 1944, a portrait of Governor Craig by Asheville artist Cuthbert Lee was unveiled in the state senate chamber in Raleigh. North Carolina named Mount Craig, the second highest peak in Pisgah National Forest, in his honor in 1947, and erected a historical marker near his Asheville home in 1949. Another marker notes his childhood home in Bertie County. Duke University&#x27;s library holds his papers.

== Name ==
The name Mima (美馬) is derived from two characters meaning &quot;Beautiful Horse&quot;. Mima was once home to many horse breeders. Although breeders and keepers are not so common in present-day Mima, the history lives on today in art, local products, and such.

== Ikezuki ==
There is also the story of a famous horse named Ikezuki. He is a famous horse born from a captive Mima Town mother and a wild father from Mount Tsurugi. He later belonged to Shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo and often makes appearances throughout history, such as in Tale of Heike, Genpei War, and The Battle of Uji (1184) (crossing the Uji River). Ikezuki&#x27;s mother was buried at what is now Ikezuki Park. It is unsure whether Ikezuki is a factual or fictional character.

==Geography==
Mima is located in north-central Tokushima Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. Almost the entire area of Tokushima Prefecture and the mainland of Kagawa Prefecture is within a 50 kilometer radius of the city. The city is located in the lower reaches of the Yoshino River. The plains (northern part) have a Seto Inland Sea climate with less rain, and the mountainous areas (southern part) have a more rainy Pacific Ocean climate. Especially in mountainous areas, it is not uncommon for roads to freeze and snow in winter.
There are many steep slopes in the mountainous areas, and traditional steep slope farming to prevent soil erosion is used. The Yoshino River flows west–east through Mima. It is the second longest river in Shikoku, boasting a length of 194 km. It is a popular spot for fishing, kayaking, and rafting. Mount Tsurugi, the second highest mountain in Shikoku, is on the border of Mima, Naka District and Miyoshi District. The Nakoyama Highlands just east of Mt. Tsurugi, had wide slopes with many bungalows, cottages, and RV parks open from April through the end of November. One face of the mountain has a famous grass ski area, hosting the Annual World Championships with the longest run stretching 500 meters and descending 62 meters. Flowing from south to north through the town of Anabuki and the village of Koyadaira is the Anabuki River. Its sources are a collection of many streams from around the Mt. Tsurugi area, and is popular for its cleanliness. As of 2005, the Anabuki River has held its position as the cleanest river in Shikoku for 11 years. There is a thriving population of the Japanese fishes ayu, amego, and iwana. The upstream town of Koyadaira hosts the Amego Fishing Competition every year in April.

<doc id="502473" wikidata="Q5647218" url="?curid=502473" title="Handa, Tokushima">
<text>was a town located in Mima District, Tokushima, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 5,372 and a density of 104.27 persons per km2. The total area was 51.52 km2.

On March 1, 2005, Handa, along with the town of Sadamitsu, and the village of Ichiu (all from Mima District), was merged to create the town of Tsurugi.

==Geography==
Handa was situated in the valley created by the Handa River. Most of the population was concentrated near the mouth of the valley, near the Yoshino River. Yachiyo, the southern part of Handa, was mountainous and contains a number of peaks over 1000 meters.

==Education==
Handa was served by Handa Junior High School, and Handa and Yachiyo elementary schools.

==Transportation==
*National Route 192 runs along Handa&#x27;s northern edge.
*Awa-Handa Station is on the JR Shikoku Tokushima Line.

==Sightseeing==
*Handa is famous for its sōmen noodles. &quot;Handa Sōmen&quot; has been a special product of the area for over 250 years, and several sōmen makers still operate today.
*Dodoro falls is a 30m waterfall in Yachiyo.
*Oyasu Park is a popular spot for viewing cherry blossoms, and provides good views of the main part of town.
*Ishido-yama (1636m) and Yahazu-yama (1848m), although located in Ichiu, are easily accessed via a trailhead at Oso Ishido Jinja, in Handa. Yahazu-yama provides panoramic views of the Iya Valley and prominent mountains such as Mount Tsurugi, Jirogyu, and Miune.

<doc id="502475" wikidata="Q888185" url="?curid=502475" title="William Walton Kitchin">
<text>William Walton Kitchin (October 9, 1866 – November 9, 1924) was an American attorney and the 52nd governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1909 to 1913.

==Early life and family==
W.W. Kitchin was the son of William H. Kitchin and Maria Figures Arrington. He was born in Scotland Neck, North Carolina. He was the brother of Claude Kitchin and the uncle of Alvin Paul Kitchin, each of whom served in the United States Congress.

Kitchn attended Vine Hill Academy in Scotland Neck. He graduated from Wake Forest College in 1884, studied law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and passed the North Carolina Bar examination in 1887. He practiced law in Roxboro, North Carolina.

On 22 December 1892, W.W. Kitchin married Sue Musette Satterfield of Roxboro. They had six children: Sue Arrington (22 October 1893 – 5 August 1954), William Walton (16 August 1895 – 30 September 1905), Anne Maria (23 October 1897 – 16 January 1995), Elizabeth Gertrude (19 December 1899 – 9 September 1979), Clement Satterfield (19 June 1902 – 21 December 1930), and Musette Satterfield (10 August 1906 – 17 October 1996).

==Political career==
In 1892, he ran unsuccessfully for the North Carolina Senate but was later elected for six terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1897 to 1909. In 1898, he helped lead the Wilmington insurrection of 1898, a violent coup d&#x27;état by a group of white supremacists. They expelled opposition black and white political leaders from the city, destroyed the property and businesses of black citizens built up since the Civil War, including the only black newspaper in the city, and killed an estimated 60 to more than 300 people. With other members of his family, he was an active participant in leading to the approval of a state constitutional amendment in 1900 placing numerous limitations on the right of black Tar Heels to vote. In January, 1901, George Henry White, an African-American, included Kitchin in his Congressional farewell address. He said that no politician had done more to bring the African-American into disrepute. White also said that Kitchin attempted to disprove African-Americans were worthy of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In 1906 Kitchin proposed an amendment to the Post Office Department&#x27;s appropriations bill to end the $167,000 subsidy paid to Southern Railway funding the &quot;Fast Mail&quot; service, which served his constituency directly and was the last fast mail train in the United States that received such a subsidy. The train was discontinued on January 1, 1907, as a result, and Kitchin&#x27;s amendment was later used as a campaign issue against him.

Limited to one term as governor by the state constitution of the time, Kitchin ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1912. His tenure as governor was highly productive: he increased expenditures for public education and public health services, oversaw expansion of railroads and increased stability of the state&#x27;s banks, and presided over other reforms.
After completing his term, Governor Kitchin practiced law in Raleigh, NC until 1919, when his declining health led him to retire to his home in Scotland Neck, NC. He died in 1924 and is buried in the Scotland Neck Baptist Cemetery.

<doc id="502476" wikidata="Q4812279" url="?curid=502476" title="At-will employment">
<text>In United States labor law, at-will employment is an employer&#x27;s ability to dismiss an employee for any reason (that is, without having to establish &quot;just cause&quot; for termination), and without warning, as long as the reason is not illegal (e.g. firing because of the employee&#x27;s gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability status). When an employee is acknowledged as being hired &quot;at will&quot;, courts deny the employee any claim for loss resulting from the dismissal. The rule is justified by its proponents on the basis that an employee may be similarly entitled to leave their job without reason or warning. The practice is seen as unjust by those who view the employment relationship as characterized by inequality of bargaining power.

At-will employment gradually became the default rule under the common law of the employment contract in most U.S. states during the late 19th century, and was endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court during the &quot;Lochner&quot; era, when members of the U.S. judiciary consciously sought to prevent government regulation of labor markets. Over the 20th century, many states modified the rule by adding an increasing number of exceptions, or by changing the default expectations in the employment contract altogether. In workplaces with a trade union recognized for purposes of collective bargaining, and in many public sector jobs, the normal standard for dismissal is that the employer must have a &quot;just cause&quot;. Otherwise, subject to statutory rights (particularly the discrimination prohibitions under the Civil Rights Act), most states adhere to the general principle that employer and employee may contract for the dismissal protection they choose. At-will employment remains controversial, and remains a central topic of debate in the study of law and economics, especially with regard to the macroeconomic efficiency of allowing employers to summarily and arbitrarily terminate employees.

==Definition==
At-will employment is generally described as follows: &quot;any hiring is presumed to be &#x27;at will&#x27;; that is, the employer is free to discharge individuals &#x27;for good cause, or bad cause, or no cause at all,&#x27; and the employee is equally free to quit, strike, or otherwise cease work.&quot; In an October 2000 decision largely reaffirming employers&#x27; rights under the at-will doctrine, the Supreme Court of California explained:

At-will employment disclaimers are a staple of employee handbooks in the United States. It is common for employers to define what at-will employment means, explain that an employee&#x27;s at-will status cannot be changed except in a writing signed by the company president (or chief executive), and require that an employee sign an acknowledgment of their at-will status. However, the National Labor Relations Board has opposed as unlawful the practice of including in such disclaimers language declaring that the at-will nature of the employment cannot be changed without the written consent of senior management.

==History==
According to William Blackstone, the original common law rule for dismissal of employees envisaged that, unless otherwise agreed, employees would be deemed to be hired for a fixed term of one year. Over the 19th century, most states in the North adhered to the rule that the period by which an employee was paid (a week, a month or a year) determined the period of notice that should be given before a dismissal was effective. For instance, in 1870 in Massachusetts, &quot;Tatterson v. Suffolk Manufacturing Company&quot; held that an employee&#x27;s term of hiring dictated the default period of notice. By contrast, in Tennessee, a court stated in 1884 that an employer should be allowed to dismiss any worker, or any number of workers, for any reason at all. An individual, or a collective agreement, according to the general doctrine of freedom of contract could always stipulate that an employee should only be dismissed for a good reason, or a &quot;just cause&quot;, or that elected employee representatives would have a say on whether a dismissal should take effect. However, the position of the typical 19th-century worker meant that this was rare.

The at-will practice is typically traced to a treatise published by Horace Gray Wood in 1877, called &quot;Master and Servant&quot;. Wood cited four U.S. cases as authority for his rule that when a hiring was indefinite, the burden of proof was on the servant to prove that an indefinite employment term was for one year. In &quot;Toussaint v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan&quot;, the Court noted that &quot;Wood&#x27;s rule was quickly cited as authority for another proposition.&quot; Wood, however, misinterpreted two of the cases which in fact showed that in Massachusetts and Michigan, at least, the rule was that employees should have notice before dismissal according to the periods of their contract.

In New York, the first case to adopt Wood&#x27;s rule was &quot;Martin v. New York Life Insurance Company&quot; (1895). Justice Edward T. Bartlett wrote that New York law now followed Wood&#x27;s treatise, which meant that an employee who received $10,000, paid in a salary over a year, could be dismissed immediately. The case did not make reference to the previous authority. Four years earlier, &quot;Adams v. Fitzpatrick&quot; (1891) had held that New York law followed the general practice of requiring notice similar to pay periods. However, subsequent New York cases continued to follow the at-will rule into the early 20th century.

Some courts saw the rule as requiring the employee to prove an express contract for a definite term in order to maintain an action based on termination of the employment. Thus was born the U.S. at-will employment rule, which allowed discharge for no reason. This rule was adopted by all U.S. states. In 1959, the first judicial exception to the at-will rule was created by one of the California Courts of Appeal. Later, in a 1980 landmark case involving ARCO, the Supreme Court of California endorsed the rule first articulated by the Court of Appeal. The resulting civil actions by employees are now known in California as &quot;Tameny&quot; actions for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

Since 1959, several common law and statutory exceptions to at-will employment have been created.

Common law protects an employee from retaliation if the employee disobeys an employer on the grounds that the employer ordered him or her to do something illegal or immoral. However, in the majority of cases, the burden of proof remains upon the discharged employee. No U.S. state but Montana has chosen to statutorily modify the employment at-will rule. In 1987, the Montana legislature passed the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA). The WDEA is unique in that, although it purports to preserve the at-will concept in employment law, it also expressly enumerates the legal basis for a wrongful discharge action. Under the WDEA, a discharge is wrongful only if: &quot;it was in retaliation for the employee&#x27;s refusal to violate public policy or for reporting a violation of public policy; the discharge was not for good cause and the employee had completed the employer&#x27;s probationary period of employment; or the employer violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.&quot;

The doctrine of at-will employment can be overridden by an express contract or civil service statutes (in the case of government employees). As many as 34% of all U.S. employees apparently enjoy the protection of some kind of &quot;just cause&quot; or objectively reasonable requirement for termination that takes them out of the pure &quot;at-will&quot; category, including the 7.5% of unionized private-sector workers, the 0.8% of nonunion private-sector workers protected by union contracts, the 15% of nonunion private-sector workers with individual express contracts that override the at-will doctrine, and the 16% of the total workforce who enjoy civil service protections as public-sector employees.

==By state==

===Public policy exceptions===

Under the public policy exception, an employer may not fire an employee if the termination would violate the state&#x27;s public policy doctrine or a state or federal statute.

This includes retaliating against an employee for performing an action that complies with public policy (such as repeatedly warning that the employer is shipping defective airplane parts in violation of safety regulations promulgated pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958), as well as refusing to perform an action that would violate public policy. In this diagram, the pink states have the &#x27;exception&#x27;, which protects the employee.

 42 U.S. states and the District of Columbia recognize public policy as an exception to the at-will rule.

The 8 states which do not have the exception are:

* Alabama
* Florida – three limited conditions can override an at-will agreement
* Georgia
* Louisiana
* Maine
* Nebraska
* New York
* Rhode Island
===Implied contract exceptions===


Thirty-six U.S. states (and the District of Columbia) also recognize an implied contract as an exception to at-will employment.
Under the implied contract exception, an employer may not fire an employee &quot;when an implied contract is formed between an employer and employee, even though no express, written instrument regarding the employment relationship exists.&quot; Proving the terms of an implied contract is often difficult, and the burden of proof is on the fired employee. Implied employment contracts are most often found when an employer&#x27;s personnel policies or handbooks indicate that an employee will not be fired except for good cause or specify a process for firing. If the employer fires the employee in violation of an implied employment contract, the employer may be found liable for breach of contract.

Thirty-six U.S. states have an implied-contract exception. The 14 states having no such exception are:

* Arizona
* Delaware
* Florida
* Georgia
* Indiana
* Louisiana
* Massachusetts
* Missouri
* Montana
* North Carolina
* Pennsylvania
* Rhode Island
* Texas
* Virginia
The implied-contract theory to circumvent at-will employment must be treated with caution. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Texas in &quot;Matagorda County Hospital District v. Burwell&quot; held that a provision in an employee handbook stating that dismissal may be for cause, and requiring employee records to specify the reason for termination, did not modify an employee&#x27;s at-will employment. The New York Court of Appeals, that state&#x27;s highest court, also rejected the implied-contract theory to circumvent employment at will. In &quot;Anthony Lobosco, Appellant v. New York Telephone Company/NYNEX, Respondent&quot;, the court restated the prevailing rule that an employee could not maintain an action for wrongful discharge where state law recognized neither the tort of wrongful discharge, nor exceptions for firings that violate public policy, and an employee&#x27;s explicit employee handbook disclaimer preserved the at-will employment relationship. In the same 2000 decision mentioned above, the Supreme Court of California held that the length of an employee&#x27;s long and successful service, standing alone, is not evidence in and of itself of an implied-in-fact contract not to terminate except for cause.

===&quot;Implied-in-law&quot; contracts===


Eleven US states have recognized a breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as an exception to at-will employment. The states are:

* Alabama
* Alaska
* Arizona
* California
* Delaware
* Idaho
* Massachusetts
* Montana
* Nevada
* Utah
* Wyoming
Court interpretations of this have varied from requiring &quot;just cause&quot; to denial of terminations made for malicious reasons, such as terminating a long-tenured employee solely to avoid the obligation of paying the employee&#x27;s accrued retirement benefits. Other court rulings have denied the exception, holding that it is too burdensome upon the court for it to have to determine an employer&#x27;s true motivation for terminating an employee.

==Statutory exceptions==
Every state, including Montana, is at-will by default. However, Montana defaults to a probationary period, after which termination is only lawful if for good cause.

Although all U.S. states have a number of statutory protections for employees, wrongful termination lawsuits brought under statutory causes of action typically use the federal anti-discrimination statutes, which prohibit firing or refusing to hire an employee because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap status. Other reasons an employer may not use to fire an at-will employee are:

*for refusing to commit illegal acts – an employer is not permitted to fire an employee because the employee refuses to commit an act that is illegal.
*family or medical leave – federal law permits most employees to take a leave of absence for specific family or medical problems. An employer is not permitted to fire an employee who takes family or medical leave for a reason outlined in the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
*in retaliation against the employee for a protected action taken by the employee – &quot;protected actions&quot; include suing for wrongful termination, testifying as a witness in a wrongful termination case, or even opposing what they believe, whether they can prove it or not, to be wrongful discrimination. In the federal case of &quot;Ross v. Vanguard&quot;, Raymond Ross successfully sued his employer for firing him due to his allegations of racial discrimination.
Examples of federal statutes include:

*The Equal Pay Act of 1963 (relating to discrimination on the basis of sex in payment of wages);
*Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (relating to discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin);
*The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (relating to certain discrimination on the basis of age with respect to persons of at least 40 years of age);
*The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (related to certain discrimination on the basis of handicap status);
*The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (relating to certain discrimination on the basis of handicap status).
*The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) provides protection to employees who wish to join or form a union and those who engage in union activity. The act also protects employees who engage in a concerted activity. Most employers set forth their workplace rules and policies in an employee handbook. A common provision in those handbooks is a statement that employment with the employer is &quot;at-will&quot;. In 2012, the National Labor Relations Board, the federal administrative agency responsible for enforcing the NLRA, instituted two cases attacking at-will employment disclaimers in employee handbooks. The NLRB challenged broadly worded disclaimers, alleging that the statements improperly suggested that employees could not act concertedly to attempt to change the at-will nature of their employment, and thereby interfered with employees&#x27; protected rights under the NLRA.

==Controversy==
The doctrine of at-will employment has been heavily criticized for its severe harshness upon employees. It has also been criticized as predicated upon flawed assumptions about the inherent distribution of power and information in the employee-employer relationship. On the other hand, libertarian scholars in the field of law and economics such as Professors Richard A. Epstein and Richard Posner credit employment-at-will as a major factor underlying the strength of the U.S. economy.

At-will employment has also been identified as a reason for the success of Silicon Valley as an entrepreneur-friendly environment.

In a 2009 article surveying the academic literature from both U.S. and international sources, University of Virginia law professor J.H. Verkerke explained that &quot;although everyone agrees that raising firing costs must necessarily deter both discharges and new hiring, predictions for all other variables depend heavily on the structure of the model and assumptions about crucial parameters.&quot; The detrimental effect of raising firing costs is generally accepted in mainstream economics (particularly neoclassical economics); for example, professors Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok explain in their economics textbook that employers become more reluctant to hire employees if they are uncertain about their ability to immediately fire them. However, according to contract theory, raising firing costs can sometimes be desirable when there are frictions in the working of markets. For instance, Schmitz (2004) argues that employment protection laws can be welfare-enhancing when principal-agent relationships are plagued by asymmetric information.

The first major empirical study on the impact of exceptions to at-will employment was published in 1992 by James N. Dertouzos and Lynn A. Karoly of the RAND Corporation, which found that recognizing tort exceptions to at-will could cause up to a 2.9% decline in aggregate employment and recognizing contract exceptions could cause an additional decline of 1.8%. According to Verkerke, the RAND paper received &quot;considerable attention and publicity&quot;. Indeed, it was favorably cited in a 2010 book published by the libertarian Cato Institute.

However, a 2000 paper by Thomas Miles did not find any effect upon aggregate employment, but found that adopting the implied contract exception causes use of temporary employment to rise as much as 15%. Later work by David Autor in the mid-2000s identified multiple flaws in Miles&#x27; methodology, found that the implied contract exception decreased aggregate employment 0.8 to 1.6%, and confirmed the outsourcing phenomenon identified by Miles, but also found that the tort exceptions to at-will had no statistically significant influence. Autor and colleagues later found in 2007 that the good faith exception does reduce job flows, and seems to cause labor productivity to rise but total factor productivity to drop. In other words, employers forced to find a &quot;good faith&quot; reason to fire an employee tend to automate operations to avoid hiring new employees, but also suffer an impact on total productivity because of the increased difficulty in discharging unproductive employees.

Other researchers have found that at-will exceptions have a negative effect on the reemployment of terminated workers who have yet to find replacement jobs, while their opponents, citing studies that say &quot;job security has a large negative effect on employment rates,&quot; argue that hedonic regressions on at-will exceptions show large negative effects on individual welfare with regard to home values, rents, and wages.

<doc id="502481" wikidata="Q32713" url="?curid=502481" title="Jungang line">
<text>The Jungang line () is a railway line connecting Cheongnyangni in Seoul to Moryang in Gyeongju in South Korea, traversing central South Korea from the northwest to the southeast. It is also referred to as the rail line of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway from Yongsan station to Jipyeong station. The section from Cheongnyangni to Dodam was designated as a semi-high-speed railway.

==History==
The Jungang line was opened along its full length between Cheongnyangni and Gyeongju on April 1, 1942. &quot;Jungang&quot; means &quot;central&quot; in Korean, and describes the line&#x27;s route through the mountains in the east-central part of South Korea. When Korea was under Japanese rule, the line was briefly known as the Gyeonggyeong Line, referring to a line running between Seoul and Gyeongju.

On 1 December 1938 &#x27;Donghae Jungbu line&#x27; (Daegu–Haksan) was divided into three parts: Daegu Line, the Gyeongygeong line and Donghae Jungbu line, which was later merged into the Donghae Nambu Line. At the same time the Gyeonggyeong line was extended to the Ubo Station. The southern part, Gyeonggyeong Nambu Line, was opened as follows:
On the other hand, the northern part, Gyeonggyeong Bukpu Line, was constructed as follows:
On 1 April 1942, the two lines were merged into the Gyeonggyeong Line with the opening of the section Jechon–Yeongju (62.3 km). The name of the line was changed back to its present name after the end of World War II.

Following the 1961 coup, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction started South Korea&#x27;s first five-year plan, which included a construction program to complete the railway network and foster economic growth. As part of the program, in the outskirts of Seoul, a long avoiding line was built from Mangu to Seongbuk on the Gyeongwon Line, called the Mangu Line, which opened on December 30, 1963.

==Upgrade==
A part of the line was the first to be electrified with the 25 kV/60 Hz AC catenary system in South Korea: the catenary on the 155.2 km long Cheongnyangri–Jecheon section went into service on June 20, 1973. The 29.0 km long extension to Danseong followed on December 30, 1987, finally the 35.0 km long extension to Yeongju on December 23, 1988.

The entire line is foreseen for electrification and double-tracking.

===Phase 1: Cheongnyangni–Deokso===
The double-tracking of the 18.0 km long section from the terminus Cheongnyangni to Deokso was completed first on December 16, 2005. Work started in mid-2001 with a planned budget of 1,700 billion won.

On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Cheongnyangri–Wonju section of the Jungang Line is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h.

=== Phase 2: Deokso-Wonju ===
The first 5.7 km to Paldang was opened on December 27, 2007, the next 15.9 km to Guksu on December 29, 2008, and another 19.7 km to Yongmun on December 23, 2009. The total budget of the 90.4&amp;km long upgrade project is 2,036.847 billion won.

The upgrade of the Deokso–Wonju section is more extensive, with significant re-alignments to enable a line speed of 150 km/h.

===Phase 3: Wonju–Jecheon Electrified Double Track Line Project===
The Wonju–Jecheon Electrified Double Track Line Project was launched in 2011, connecting Seowonju station at Wonju and Bongyang station at Jecheon. Between Seowonju and Bongyang, the double-track line was to run in a new alignment, most of which would be the 25,080 metre long Musil Tunnel. Works on the tunnel was slated to commence in June 2011, for a planned start of service on the Wonju-Jecheon section in January 2021. Under the government&#x27;s 2010 strategic plan for 2020, the new alignment in the Wonju–Bongyang section was to be laid out for 250 km/h, the rest to Jecheon was to be upgraded for 230 km/h. The new alignment was to reduce line distance by 5.5 km and was to cut travel time by 20 minutes. The project budget for the entire 41.1 km Wonju-Jecheon section was 1,140.061 billion won.

Later, the plan was redesigned to build two tunnels instead of single long tunnel, to improve safety. On June 22, 2020, construction was completed and Korean National Railway(KR) started trial running. Commercial running started on January 5, 2021.

Plans for the double-tracking of the section from Bongyang, the terminus of the Chungbuk Line, to Jecheon, have been prepared separately.

===Phase 4: Dodam-Yeongcheon===
====Jecheon-Dodam Section====
The Jecheon–Dodam section was double-tracked. The rebuilt section is 17.4 km in length, was built with a budget of 320.024 billion won, and is primarily intended to improve capacity for freight transports to a cement factory. The project was completed on 31 March 2011.

==== Dodam–Andong Section ====
The reconstruction of the Dodam–Andong section as an electrified double-track line started in December 2013. The section includes the realignment of the Danyang–Yeongju section, which opened as a single-track section on 13 December 2020. The Yeongju–Danchon section, another re-alignment, opened as single-track on 17 December 2020. The electrified and double-tracked Dodam–Danyang section opened in 5 January 2021, the second track on the Danyang–Yeongju section opened on 30 June 2022, finally the second track on the Yeongju–Danchon section and the electrified and double-tracked Danchon–Andong section opened on 28 July 2022. Operation of the entire section at the maximum line speed started only in December 2023.

==== Andong-Yeongcheon Section ====
This section was originally planned to open in the summer 2022 as electrified single-track line, prepared for later double-tracking. In December 2021, the decision was made to complete the section as a double-track line, with opening planned in Late 2024. Construction started in December 2022 and completed on 20 December 2024. After 23 years, the whole Jungang Line became fully double-tracked and electrified.

=== Phase 5: Yeongcheon-Singyeongju ===
Electrification and doubling in this section were completed on December 28, 2021.

==Services==
=== KTX service ===
KTX service was launched on 5 January 2021. Since Jungang Line is not a dedicated high-speed line, the new rolling-stock KTX-Eum was adopted. KTX service was expanded to Bujeon station on 20 December 2024. The time required is around four hours.
===Regular rail service===
Before the KTX era, trans-Korean Tongil-ho trains were in operation on the Jungang and Donghae Nambu lines, providing a 12-hour train journey from Seoul to Busan.

The entire line is served by cross-country Mugunghwa-ho trains, which are most frequent until Jecheon, where many trains continue east on the Taebaek Line. As of October 2010, the travel time from Cheongnyangni in Seoul is a minimum of 1 hour 18 minutes to Wonju, 2 hours 2 minutes to Jecheon, around 3 hours to Yeongju, 5 hours 22 minutes to Yeongcheon, and 6 hours 8 minutes to Gyeongju. Some trains continue to Bujeon station in Busan, with a total travel time of 8 hours by day and 20 minutes shorter by night. After 20 December 2024, the Mugunghwa-ho were replaced by ITX-Maum.

===Seoul Metropolitan Subway===

Commuter rail service was launched on Jungang line (fully integrated with the Seoul Metropolitan Subway) as the upgrading of the line progressed. The service started on December 16, 2005, connecting parts of the Gyeongwon Line (from Yongsan to Hoegi station) and the Jungang line (from Hoegi to Deokso) under the interim name Yongsan–Deokso Line.

An extension to Paldang station on December 27, 2007, brought the official renaming of the service to Jungang line, although the line actually incorporates parts of &quot;both&quot; Gyeongwon and Jungang lines. In December 2008, the service was extended to Guksu Station, and an express train service was launched, operating twice a day during morning commuting hours. The express trains ran westward only, from Yangpyeong to Yongsan. The service was finally extended to Yongmun station in Yangpyeong County on December 23, 2009.

The western terminus was Yongsan station ever since the opening of the line. However, with the completion of Gyeongui Line extension to Yongsan on December 27, 2014, both the Jungang and Gyeongui lines were combined into the &quot;Gyeongui-Jungang Line,&quot; and trains now run to Munsan station near the North Korean border.

==Stations==
This list does not include stations served only by Gyeongui-Jungang Line services.

After Jipyeong, major stations on the line include:

*Samsan station
*Seowonju station
*Wonju station
*Bongyang station, the terminus of the Chungbuk Line
*Jecheon station, the terminus of the Taebaek Line. All Chungbuk Line trains departs from here due to the location of Bongyang Station

<doc id="502487" wikidata="Q3909503" url="?curid=502487" title="Potato Head Blues">
<text>&quot;Potato Head Blues&quot; is a Louis Armstrong composition regarded as one of his finest recordings. It was made by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Seven for Okeh Records in Chicago, Illinois on May 10, 1927. It was recorded during a remarkably productive week in which Armstrong&#x27;s usual Hot Five was temporarily expanded to seven players by the addition of tuba and drums. Some scholars have suggested that a key melodic figure in &quot;Potato Head Blues&quot; was picked up by Hoagy Carmichael for &quot;Stardust.&quot; Its musical composition entered the public domain on January 1, 2023.

The recording features clarinet work by Johnny Dodds, and the stop-time solo chorus in the last half of the recording is one of Armstrong&#x27;s most famous solos. The stop-time aspects of &quot;Potato Head Blues&quot; was derived from the tap-dancing tradition at the Sunset Café as well as the New Orleanian tradition of adding breaks and fill-ins.

Author and Director of Research Collections for the Louis Armstrong House Museum, Ricky Riccardi states that when it came to taking improvised solos, Armstrong was light years ahead of his contemporaries in every way: command of his instrument, harmonic knowledge, a swinging rhythmic feel and put simply, the ability to &quot;tell a story.&quot; 1927’s &quot;Potato Head Blues,” with the expanded Hot Seven, again represents a joyous example of New Orleans polyphony until Armstrong steps up a takes a stop-time solo that still sounds fresh and modern today, defining the art of the improvised solo in not just jazz but all forms of popular music. 

Critic Thomas Ward called this recording &quot;one of the most astonishing accomplishments in all of twentieth century music.&quot; Ralph Ellison described it as &quot;a classic demonstration of African-American elegance.&quot;

In Woody Allen&#x27;s 1979 film, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, the character Isaac Davis (played by Allen) lists Armstrong&#x27;s recording of &quot;Potato Head Blues&quot; as one of the reasons that life is worth living.

<text>A housewife (also known as a [[homemaker]] or a stay-at-home mother/mom/mum) is a woman whose role is running or managing her family&#x27;s home—housekeeping, which may include caring for her children; cleaning and maintaining the home; making, buying and/or mending clothes for the family; buying, cooking, and storing food for the family; buying goods that the family needs for everyday life; partially or solely managing the family budget—and who is not employed outside the home (e.g., a &quot;career woman&quot;). The male equivalent is the househusband.

&quot;The Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; defines a housewife as a married woman who is in charge of her household. The British &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Twentieth Century Dictionary&quot; (1901) defines a housewife as &quot;the mistress of a household; a female domestic manager [...]&quot;.

In the Western world, stereotypical gender roles, particularly for women, were challenged by the feminist movement in the latter 20th century to allow some women to choose whether to be housewives or to have a career. (However financial barriers such as expensive childcare or disability can impede either). Changing economics also increased the prevalence of two-income households.

==Sociology and economics==
Some feminists and non-feminist economists (particularly proponents of historical materialism, the methodological approach of Marxist historiography) note that the value of housewives&#x27; work is ignored in standard formulations of economic output, such as GDP or employment figures. A housewife typically works many unpaid hours a week and often depends on income from her husband&#x27;s work for financial support. The importance of housewives&#x27; work is sometimes disregarded in standard economic figures such as GDP or employment data because of how these metrics are measured. Housewives&#x27; work is excluded from GDP statistics since it is not exchanged in the market.

Some economists state that housewives frequently work long hours doing a variety of tasks such as cooking, cleaning, childcare, eldercare, and managing family finances. These chores are critical for maintaining families and supporting other family members&#x27; productive activities, such as paid jobs.

===Traditional societies===
Contrary to a common belief that in hunter-gatherer societies men typically hunted animals for meat while women gathered other foods such as grain, fruit, and vegetables (as asserted, for example, in Richard B. Lee and Irven DeVore&#x27;s 1968 book &quot;Man the Hunter&quot;), ethnographic studies of recent and current hunter-gatherer societies show women actively participating in hunting, as among the Agta people of the Philippines, where women hunt even while menstruating, pregnant, and breastfeeding. Fossil and archaeological evidence also indicate that women have a long history of hunting. In addition, evidence from exercise science shows that women are better suited to endurance activities, which might have been conducive to pursuing prey over long distances. However, an attempted verification of this study found &quot;that multiple methodological failures all bias their results in the same direction...their analysis does not contradict the wide body of empirical evidence for gendered divisions of labor in foraging societies&quot;.

In rural societies where the main source of work is farming, women have also taken care of gardens and animals around the house, generally helping men with heavy work when a job needed to be done quickly, usually because of the season.

Examples of the heavy work involving farming that a traditional housewife in a rural society would do are:
* Picking fruit when it is ripe for market
* Planting rice in a paddy field
* Harvesting and stacking grain
* Cutting hay for animals

In rural studies, the word &quot;housewife&quot; is occasionally used as a term for &quot;a woman who does the majority of the chores within a farm&#x27;s compound,&quot; as opposed to field and livestock work..

Whether the productive contributions of women were considered &quot;work&quot; varied by time and culture. Throughout much of the 20th century, the women working on a family farm, no matter how much work they did, would be counted in the US census as being unemployed, whereas the men doing the same or (even less) work were counted as being employed as farmers.

===Modern society===
A research based on 7733 respondents who were aged 18–65 and legally married women in 20 European countries showed men and women share less housework in countries that publicly support gender equality. On the contrary, women did more housework than men.

Full-time homemakers in modern times usually share income produced by members of the household who are employed; wage-earners working full-time benefit from the unpaid work provided by the homemaker; otherwise, the performance of such work (childcare, cooking, housecleaning, teaching, transporting, etc.) could be a household expense. US states with community property recognize joint ownership of marital property and income, and, unless a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement is followed, most marital households in the US operate as a joint financial team and file taxes jointly.

===Education===
The method, necessity, and extent of educating housewives has been debated since at least the 20th century.

== By country ==
===In China===
In imperial China (excluding periods of the Tang dynasty), women were bound to homemaking by the doctrines of Confucianism and cultural norms. Generally, girls did not attend school and, therefore, spent the day doing household chores (for example, cooking and cleaning) with their mothers and female relatives. In most cases, the husband was alive and able to work, so the wife was almost always forbidden to take a job and mainly spent her days at home or doing other domestic tasks. As Confucianism spread across East Asia, this social norm was also observed in Korea, Japan and Vietnam. As foot binding became common after the Song dynasty, many women lost the ability to work outside.

After the founding of the Republic of China in 1911, these norms were gradually loosened and many women were able to enter the workforce. Shortly thereafter, a growing number of females began to be permitted to attend schools. Starting with the rule of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, all women were freed from compulsory family roles. During the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, some women even worked in fields that were traditionally reserved for males.

In modern China, housewives are no longer as common, especially in the largest cities and other urban areas. Many modern women work simply because one person&#x27;s income is insufficient to support the family, a decision made easier by the fact that it is common for Chinese grandparents to watch after their grandchildren until they are old enough to go to school. Nonetheless, the number of Chinese housewives has been steadily rising in recent years as China&#x27;s economy expands.

===In India===

In a traditional Hindu family, the head of the family is the &quot;Griha Swami&quot; (Lord of the House) and his wife is the &quot;Griha Swamini&quot; (Lady of the House). The Sanskrit words &quot;Grihast&quot; and &quot;Grihasta&quot; perhaps come closest to describing the entire gamut of activities and roles undertaken by the homemaker. &quot;Grih&quot; is the Sanskrit root for house or home; Grihasta and Grihast are derivatives of this root, as is Grihastya. The couple lives in the state called &quot;Grihastashram&quot; or family system and together they nurture the family and help its members (both young and old) through the travails of life. The woman who increments the family tree (bears children) and protects those children is described as the &quot;Grihalakshmi&quot; (the wealth of the house) and &quot;Grihashoba&quot; (the glory of the house). The elders of the family are known as &quot;Grihshreshta&quot;. The husband or wife may engage in countless other activities which may be social, religious, political or economic in nature for the ultimate welfare of the family and society. However, their unified status as joint householders is the nucleus from within which they operate in society. The traditional status of a woman as a homemaker anchors them in society and provides meaning to their activities within the social, religious, political and economic framework of their world. However, as India undergoes modernisation, many women are in employment, particularly in the larger cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, where most women will work. The role of the male homemaker is not traditional in India, but it is socially accepted in urban areas. According to one sociologist&#x27;s study in 2006, twelve percent of unmarried Indian men would consider being a homemaker according to a survey conducted by &quot;Business Today&quot;. One sociologist, Sushma Tulzhapurkar, called this a shift in Indian society, saying that a decade ago, &quot;it was an unheard concept and not to mention socially unacceptable for men to give up their jobs and remain at home.&quot; However, only 22.7 percent of Indian women are part of the labor force, compared to 51.6 percent of men; thus, women are more likely to be caregivers because most do not work outside the home.

===In North Korea===
Until around 1990, the North Korean government required every able-bodied male to be employed by some state enterprise. However, some 30% of married women of working age were allowed to stay at home as full-time housewives (fewer than in some countries in the same region like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan; more than in the former Soviet Union, Mainland China and Nordic countries like Sweden, and about the same as in the United States). In the early 1990s, after an estimated 900,000-3,500,000 people perished in the North Korean famine, the old system began to fall apart. In some cases women began by selling homemade food or household items they could do without. Today at least three-quarters of North Korean market vendors are women. A joke making the rounds in Pyongyang goes: &#x27;What do a husband and a pet dog have in common?&#x27; Answer: &#x27;Neither works nor earns money, but both are cute, stay at home and can scare away burglars.&#x27;

=== In Sweden ===
The term (&#x27;housewife&#x27;) emerged in the 1920s, when it was used in contrast to , &#x27;professional woman&#x27;. Between 1930 and 1960, the number of housewives in Sweden increased from 930,000 to 1,148,000. This development was linked to the transition from an agrarian to an industrial society. From the 1930s onwards, the number of people employed in agriculture declined, and more and more people moved from rural areas to the cities. At the same time, the number of married couples increased. More and more people, mainly men, were earning a living outside the household, primarily through wage employment in industry. Women became housewives, with special responsibility for children.

A (&#x27;luxury or pampered wife&#x27;) was a housewife, that didn&#x27;t do any work at home, but rather let hired people cook, clean, take care of the children, and so on. Common in the upper class, rarely seen today.
A common attitude was to accept the gender roles of the time as self-evident, but to advocate different kinds of improvements for women working at home. More radical people argued that the housewife was trapped in her economic dependence on her husband, that it was unfair that she was not paid for her work and that she was deprived of opportunities to stimulate and develop her abilities. They argued that the housewife, the woman, was seen as a person without her own understanding and capacity and was prevented from participating in society at large.

In the early 1960s, there were lively discussions about the role of women in society, their right to education and work, and their importance in raising children and the family. In an influential 1961 article entitled (&#x27;The Probation of Women&#x27;), Eva Moberg, one of the most influential commentators, described the idea of the stay-at-home wife as an outmoded remnant of peasant society.

Moberg pushed for political reforms to improve women&#x27;s conditions in order to liberate women. By working professionally, women&#x27;s identity would change. She would become economically independent, which would also liberate men from the traditional male role.

Another debater, , described the fact that many women did not work as economically indefensible. In a book of debates, Boëthius posed the question &quot;Can we afford wives?&quot; Women, Boëthius argued, represented an underutilized reserve of labor that, if tapped, could significantly increase the purchasing power and standard of living of households. Boëthius built on the ideas of the economist Per Holmberg, as expressed in the book in 1966.

From the late 1960s onwards, the number of housewives steadily declined. Many took paid work in schools, health, and social care as the public sector expanded. More than 500,000 housewives entered the workforce between the late 1960s and early 1980s. Between 1968 and 1970 alone, the number of newly employed women in Sweden increased by 100,000 each year.

A combination of labour demand and gender equality concerns led to several policy reforms that made it easier for women to work and for families to care for their children together. In the 1930s and 1940s, nine out of ten Swedish children had a mother who worked at home while they were growing up; by the 1980s, fewer than one in ten children had a mother who was a housewife until they turned 16. However, women with children up to pre-school age generally continued to work at home until subsidized daycare was introduced on a larger scale from around the mid-1970s.

Developments from 1960 onwards were very much a result of government action. Women&#x27;s entry into the labour market was encouraged by the abolition of joint taxation and the expansion of childcare facilities. Joint taxation of spouses was abolished in 1971. The report of the so-called &quot;childcare inquiry&quot; (&quot;&quot;) on pre-school education in 1972 was the starting point for the expansion of public childcare in the early years. By the end of the 1970s, 350,000 children had been enrolled in daycare centers. The fact that women were gainfully employed was described by leading commentators as a win-win situation for children too. The idea was that children had more difficulty developing independence if they spent their days in an overprotected home environment than if they were in a daycare center with qualified staff.

The reformers were opposed by more conservative groups, who believed that women&#x27;s role was to look after the home, bring up children and support the working man. One organization that sought to raise public opinion against the reforms was , &#x27;Save the Family&#x27;. It began its work in January 1970, protesting what it saw as an attempt to dismantle the structure of the family through Marxist reforms. In the 1970 petition campaign, collected 63,000 signatures to which it attached its letter of protest against the family policy reform proposals. The organization published books of debate in polemics with reform advocates during the early 1970s.

One of the group&#x27;s leading figures was Brita Nordström. Nordström rejected the idea that gender roles are learned behaviours and argued that women&#x27;s role as housewives was natural. While the woman was the emotional leader of the family, the one who instilled harmony and stability, the man&#x27;s job was to provide and defend and to establish the family&#x27;s position in society. Psychologist Kristina Humble was another leading figure in the movement. In a chapter of the debate book &#x27;The Right to Family Life&#x27;, Humble argued that the housewife&#x27;s desire for paid employment was based on naive demands for the satisfaction of desire. She argued that differences in gender roles were caused by genetic differences, through which men were more predisposed to struggle and self-assertion. Humble paid particular attention to the plight of children as more women entered the workforce, and argued against the expansion of public childcare, believing that staying in daycare would cause an increase in juvenile delinquency and mental illness among children.

In today&#x27;s Sweden, where most women are educated and gainfully employed, there is seldom talk about being a housewife without being on parental leave (or maternity leave, and for men, paternity leave). During this period, parents receive financial compensation through the . Traditional housewives are now quite rare in Sweden.

=== In the United Kingdom ===
====15th-17th centuries====
An example of a person described as a &quot;house wife&quot; (spelt as &quot;huswyfe&quot;) can be seen in a record of 1452, where Elizabeth Banham of Dunstable, Beds, is thus described.

In Great Britain, the lives of housewives of the 17th century consisted of separate, distinct roles for males and females within the home. Typically, men&#x27;s work consisted of one specific task, such as ploughing. While men had a sole duty, women were responsible for various, timely tasks, such as milking cows, clothing production, cooking, baking, housekeeping, childcare, and so on. Women faced the responsibility not only of domestic duties and childcare, but agricultural production. Due to their long list of responsibilities, females faced long work days with little to no sleep at busy times of year. Their work is described as, &quot;the housewife&#x27;s tasks &#x27;have never an end&#x27;, combining a daily cycle with seasonal work&quot;.

====19th-20th centuries====

In 1911, 90% of wives were not employed in the work force. Ann Oakley, author of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Work: The Housewife, Past, and Present&quot;, describes the role of a 19th-century housewife as &quot;a demeaning one, consisting of monotonous, fragmented work which brought no financial remuneration, let alone any recognition.&quot; As a middle class housewife, typical duties consisted of organizing and maintaining a home that emphasized the male breadwinner&#x27;s financial success. Throughout this time period, the role of the housewife was not only accepted in society, but a sought-after desire. Eventually, women, due to the difficulty and consuming nature of these tasks, began to focus solely on one profession. By focusing on a particular niche, women spent more time outside of the home, where they could flourish independently.

As a housewife in the United Kingdom, females were encouraged to be precise and systematic when following duties. In 1869, R. K. Phillip published a household manual, titled, &quot;The Reason Why: The Domestic Science.&quot; The manual taught women how to perform certain duties, as well as the necessity behind their household chores. Cookbooks and manuals provided exact measurements and instructions for baking and cooking, written in an eloquent manner. Complicated recipes required a knowledge of math – arithmetic, fractions, and ratios. Cookbooks and household manuals were written for women, therefore, eliminating the idea of men participating in domestic duties.

In most cases, women chose to work in the home. Work outside of the home was deemed unattractive, difficult, and daunting. Since the female was heavily involved with her children and domestic duties, certain risks were associated with a woman&#x27;s absence. For example, a life in the labor force doubled a women&#x27;s average workload. Not only was she expected to financially provide, but she was fully responsible for caring and raising her children. If the mother chose to work, child care costs began to add up, therefore, decreasing the incentives for the woman to hold a demanding job. If a working mother could not afford to pay for child care, this often resulted in her appointing her older children to act as the younger children&#x27;s caretakers. While this was financially efficient, it was looked down upon by society and other housewives. In this time period, many believed that younger children were at risk for injuries or other physical harm if cared for by older siblings.

Within this time period, women became involved with consumer politics, through organizations such as the Co-operative Union. Organizations allowed women to get involved, as well as develop an understanding of feminism. In 1833, the Women&#x27;s Co-operative Union was established. Margaret Llewelyn Davies, one of the organization&#x27;s key female leaders, spoke out on topics regarding divorce, maternity benefits, and birth control. Similarly, Clementina Black helped establish a consumer&#x27;s league, which attempted to boycott organizations that did not pay women fair wages. Compared to earlier centuries, women found a voice in politics and began understanding the concept of feminism. Instead of focusing purely on household and childcare duties, women slowly merged into the public sector of society.

In recent years, accompanied by the respect of housewives, the UK is paying more attention to the value created by housewife. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), childcare accounts for 61.5% of unpaid work&#x27;s value at home, the rest includes 16.1% in transport, 9,7% in providing and maintaining a home, others in giving care to adults, the preparation of meals as well as clothing and laundry. The total unpaid work at home was valued at £38,162 per UK household in 2014, according to ONS.

Two British magazines for housewives have been published: &quot;The Housewife&quot; (London: Offices of &quot;The Million&quot;, 1886[1900]) and &quot;Housewife&quot; (London: Hultons, 1939–68). &quot;On a Tired Housewife&quot; is an anonymous poem about the housewife&#x27;s lot:
&lt;poem&gt;
Here lies a poor woman who was always tired,
She lived in a house where help wasn&#x27;t hired:
Her last words on earth were: &quot;Dear friends, I am going
To where there&#x27;s no cooking, or washing, or sewing,
For everything there is exact to my wishes,
For where they don&#x27;t eat there&#x27;s no washing of dishes.
I&#x27;ll be where loud anthems will always be ringing,
But having no voice I&#x27;ll be quit of the singing.
Don&#x27;t mourn for me now, don&#x27;t mourn for me never,
I am going to do nothing for ever and ever.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

===In the United States===
About 50% of married U.S. women in 1978 continued working after giving birth; in 1997, the number grew to 61%. The number of housewives increased in the 2000s. During the Great Recession, a decrease in average income made two incomes more necessary, and the percentage of married U.S. women who kept working after giving birth increased to 69% by 2009. As of 2014, according to the Pew Research Center, more than one in four mothers are stay-at-home in the U.S.

Housewives in America were typical in the middle of the 20th century among middle-class and upper-class white families. Black families, recent immigrants, and other minority groups tended not to benefit from the union wages, government policies, and other factors that led to white wives being able to stay at home during these decades.

A 2005 study estimated that 31% of working mothers leave the workplace for an average of 2.2 years, most often precipitated by the birth of the second child. This gives her time to concentrate full-time on child-rearing and to avoid the high cost of childcare, particularly through the early years (before school begins at age five). There is considerable variability within the stay-at-home mother population with regard to their intent to return to the paid workforce. Some plan to work from their homes, some will do part-time work, some intend to return to part- or full-time work when their children have reached school age, some may increase their skill sets by returning to higher education, and others may find it financially feasible to refrain from entering (or re-entering) the paid workforce. Research has linked feelings of &quot;maternal guilt and separation anxiety&quot; to returning to the workforce.

Similarly, there is considerable variation in the stay-at-home mother&#x27;s attitude towards domestic work not related to caring for children. Some may embrace a traditional role of housewife by cooking and cleaning in addition to caring for children. Others see their primary role as that of childcare providers, supporting their children&#x27;s physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual development while sharing or outsourcing other aspects of caring for the home.

==History==
Although men have generally been thought of as the primary or sole breadwinners for families in recent history, the division of labor between men and women in traditional societies required both genders to take an active role in obtaining resources outside the domestic sphere. Prior to agriculture and animal husbandry, reliable food sources were a scarce commodity. To achieve optimal nutrition during this time, it was imperative that both men and women focus their energies on hunting and gathering as many edible foods as possible to sustain themselves on a daily basis. Lacking the technologies necessary to store and preserve food, it was critical for men and women to seek out and obtain fresh food sources almost continuously. These nomadic tribes used gender differences to their advantage, allowing men and women to use their complementary adaptations and survival strategies to find the most diverse and nutritionally complete foods available. For example, in the context of daily foraging, childcare itself was not a hindrance to women&#x27;s productivity; rather, performing this task with her children both increased the overall efficiency of the activity (more people participating equals a greater yield of edible roots, berries, nuts, and plants), and functioned as an important hands-on lesson in survival skills for each child. By sharing the burden of daily sustenance – and developing specialized gender niches – humans not only ensured their continued survival, but also paved the way for later technologies to evolve and grow through experience.

In the 19th century, more and more women in industrialising countries stopped being homemakers and farm wives and began to undertake paid work in various industries outside the home and away from the family farm, in addition to the work they did at home. At this time many big factories were set up, first in England, then in other European countries and the United States. Many thousands of young women went to work in factories; most factories employed women in roles different from those occupied by men. There were also women who worked at home for low wages while caring for their children at the same time.

Being a housewife was only realistic among middle-class and upper-class families. In working-class families, it was typical for women to work. In the 19th century, a third to half of married women in England were recorded in the census as working for outside pay, and some historians believe this to be an undercount. Among married couples that could afford it, the wife often managed the housework, gardening, cooking, and children without working outside the home. Women were often very proud to be a good homemaker and have their house and children respectably taken care of. Other women, like Florence Nightingale, pursued non-factory professions even though they were wealthy enough not to need the income. Some professions open to women were also restricted to unmarried women (e.g. teaching).

In the early 20th century, both world wars (World War I, 1914–18; and World War II, 1939–45) were fought by the men of many countries. (There were also special roles in the armed forces carried out by women, e.g. nursing, transport, etc. and in some countries women soldiers also.) While the men were at war, many of their womenfolk went to work outside the home to keep the countries running. Women, who were also homemakers, worked in factories, businesses and farms. At the end of both wars, many men had died, and others returned injured. Some men were able to return to their previous positions, but some women stayed in the workforce as well. In addition to this surge in women entering the workforce, convenience food and domestic technology were also rising in popularity, both of which saved women time that they may have spent performing domestic tasks and enabled them to instead pursue other interests.
The governments of communist countries in the early and middle 20th century, such as the Soviet Union, Cuba and China, encouraged married women to keep working after giving birth. There were very few housewives in communist countries until free market economic reform in the 1990s, which led to a resurgence in the number of housewives. Conversely, in the Western World of the 1950s, many women quit their jobs to be housewives after giving birth. Only 11% of married women in the US kept working after giving birth.

In the 1960s in western countries, it was becoming more accepted for a woman to work until she got married, when it was a widely held belief that she should stop work and become a housewife. Many women believed that this was not treating men and women equally and that women should do whatever jobs they were able to do, whether they were married or not. &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, a 1963 book by Betty Friedan which is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the US, discussed, among other things, the lives of housewives from around the US who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children. At this time, many women were becoming more educated. As a result of this increased education, some women were able to earn more than their husbands. In very rare cases, the husband would remain at home to raise their young children while the wife worked. In 1964, a US stamp was issued honoring homemakers for the 50th anniversary of the Smith-Lever Act.

In the late 20th century, in many countries, it became harder for a family to live on a single wage. Subsequently, many women were required to return to work following the birth of their children. However, the number of male homemakers began gradually increasing in the late 20th century, especially in developed Western nations. In 2010, the number of male homemakers in the US had reached its highest point: 2.2 million. Though the male role is subject to many stereotypes, and men may have difficulties accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s. The male homemaker was more regularly portrayed in the media by the 2000s, especially in the US. However, in some regions of the world, the male homemaker remains a culturally unacceptable role.

==Songs about the housewife&#x27;s lot==
The housewife&#x27;s work has often been the subject of folk songs. Examples include: &quot;The Housewife&#x27;s Lament&quot; (from the diary of Sarah Price, Ottawa, Illinois, mid 19th century); &quot;Nine Hours a Day&quot; (1871 English song, anonymous); &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Work is Never Done&quot;, or &quot;A Woman Never Knows When her Day&#x27;s Work is Done&quot;; &quot;The Labouring Woman&quot;; &quot;How Five and Twenty Shillings were Expended in a Week&quot; (English popular songs); and &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; (London music hall song by Sue Pay, 1934). &quot;The Housewife&#x27;s Alphabet&quot; by Peggy Seeger was issued as a Blackthorne Records single in 1977 with &quot;My Son&quot;.

<text>Robert Brodnax Glenn (August 11, 1854 – May 16, 1920) was an American lawyer, prosecuting attorney, U.S. Attorney, and politician who served as a state senator and as the 51st Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1905 to 1909.

==Early life and career==
A native of Rockingham County, North Carolina, Glenn was born to Chalmers Lanier Glenn and Annie S. Dodge. He graduated from Davidson College in 1874(?), then attended the University of Virginia law school for a year then studied law under Chief Justice Richmond Mumford Pearson. He began practicing law in Stokes County before moving to Winston-Salem, where he joined the law firm of Glenn, Manly &amp; Henderson, a predecessor firm to the modern-day Womble Carlyle Sandridge &amp; Rice PLLC. In 1885, he became prosecuting attorney for the state&#x27;s ninth district. From 1893 until 1897, he served as United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. Glenn was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1898.

==Governor==
Glenn was known as the &quot;Prohibition Governor&quot; for his successful 1908 campaign to ban liquor statewide.
Glenn was also interested in conservation, as evidenced by his remark at the National Governors Association meeting of 1908: &quot;our forests are being denuded...the failure of the People throughout the States to protect the great forest industry of our country...is one of the chief sources if not the greatest source of all [natural resource waste]...Our People, regardless of the future, have been living only for the present, thinking of themselves and not of their children and their children&#x27;s children.&quot; Oher reforms were realized during his time in office. 

In 1906, a mob in Salisbury, North Carolina lynched five black men who were accused of murdering a white family. Governor Glenn ordered three companies of state militia to the scene, but it was too late; the five were already dead. The next day, Glenn, at the sheriff&#x27;s request, sent the military companies to Salisbury to guard the jail now holding one alleged lyncher. Glenn went to Salisbury himself two days later to testify in the trial of the soon to be convicted lynching &quot;leader,&quot; George Hall. Eventually, the lynch mob leader was tried and sentenced to fifteen years in prison, the first such conviction for lynching in North Carolina history. Hall, however, was pardoned by Governor Kitchin before serving the full term.
Public outcry over the lynching and concern about its negative effect on North Carolina&#x27;s business prospects prompted Glenn to send out an executive order to all county sheriffs and all state militia companies to inform him immediately of any rumor of a lynching in the future, and to shoot to kill if necessary to guard prisoners threatened by mob violence.

In 1908, while still serving as governor, Glenn was ordained as an elder at First Presbyterian Church (Raleigh, North Carolina), in what was believed to be the first instance of a sitting governor of the state assuming an ordained office in any church.

==Legacy==
Glenn was a resident of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Robert B. Glenn High School in Kernersville, North Carolina, is named after the former governor.

His boyhood home, Lower Sauratown Plantation, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

<doc id="502499" wikidata="Q5239294" url="?curid=502499" title="David Rumsey Historical Map Collection">
<text>The David Rumsey Historical Map Collection is a large private map collection with over 150,000 maps and cartographic items. The collection was created by David Rumsey who, after making his fortune in real estate, focused initially on collecting 18th- and 19th century maps of North and South America, as this era &quot;saw the rise of modern cartography.&quot;

After 2004 Rumsey expanded the collection to include maps from the 16th through 21st centuries, covering more of the world. In 2008 the collection&#x27;s website was cited as one of only seven websites with freely available &quot;skillfully compiled carto-bibliographic entries with corresponding early-map images.&quot; At that time the site comprised 16,000 digital images.

In February 2009, David Rumsey announced that the entire collection would be donated to Stanford University, including 150,000 maps and their digital images, as well as the database used to track the images. Stanford houses the collection in the new David Rumsey Map Center which opened in the main library in 2016. The website (where the images are posted on-line) was to continue as a separate public resource.

As of February 2022, there were over 114,000 digitized items available through the website, hundreds of which were hosted through Google Earth layers. Select maps are also featured at the Rumsey Maps island in Second Life. as well as 2D and 3D GIS. A new MapRank search tool has been added enabling geographical searching of about 60,000 maps from the collection by map location and coverage. In addition, a georeferencing tool has been added that allows site users to georeference and display any of the maps in the collection.

<doc id="502503" wikidata="Q178356" url="?curid=502503" title="Metropolitan Borough of Walsall">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Walsall is a metropolitan borough in the West Midlands, England. It is named after its largest settlement, Walsall, but covers a larger area which also includes Aldridge, Bloxwich, Brownhills, Darlaston, Pelsall and Willenhall.

The borough had an estimated population of 254,500 in 2007.

The borough was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It is bounded on the west by the City of Wolverhampton, the south by the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell, to the south east by the City of Birmingham, and by the Staffordshire districts of Lichfield, Cannock Chase and South Staffordshire to the east, north and northwest respectively. Most of the borough is highly industrialised and densely populated, but areas around the north and east of the borough are open space.

==History==

Prior to 1966, the area that would later become the metropolitan borough of Walsall was governed by five smaller local authorities:
*Aldridge Urban District
*Brownhills Urban District
*Darlaston Urban District
*Walsall County Borough
*Willenhall Urban District
The four urban districts were all within the administrative county of Staffordshire, in a two-tier structure with Staffordshire County Council providing county-level services. Walsall itself was a self-governing county borough, independent from the county council, but was still deemed to be part of Staffordshire for ceremonial purposes.

A review of local government in the West Midlands area was carried out under the Local Government Act 1958, culminating in the West Midlands Review Order 1965, which merged many of the districts in the area with effect from 1 April 1966. Darlaston and Willenhall were both absorbed into the county borough of Walsall, whilst the two urban districts of Brownhills and Aldridge merged to become Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District. At the same time, there were also more minor boundary adjustments with neighbouring areas around the edges of the new districts.

The new arrangements were relatively short-lived. Under the Local Government Act 1972, local government in the area was reviewed again, with Walsall County Borough and Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District merging to become the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall on 1 April 1974. On the same date the area became part of the new metropolitan county of West Midlands. For the next twelve years there was a two-tier structure in place, with West Midlands County Council providing higher county-level services. The county council was abolished in 1986.

There were adjustments to some of the boundaries between Walsall and its neighbours in 1994.

==Governance==

===Parliamentary constituencies===
Since the 2024 general election, the residents of the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall have been represented in the UK Parliament by Members of Parliament (MPs) for four separate parliamentary constituencies. Two, Walsall and Bloxwich and Aldridge-Brownhills fall wholly within the borough and are represented by Valerie Vaz (Labour) and Wendy Morton (Conservative) respectively. Parts of the borough are within the constituencies of Wolverhampton North East and Wolverhampton South East, represented by Sureena Brackenridge and Pat McFadden (both Labour) respectively.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, the borough was part of the West Midlands constituency in the European Parliament. The West Midlands region elected seven MEPs.

===Council===
In 1974, Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council was created to administer the new metropolitan borough. Elections to the council take place in three out of every four years, with one-third of the seats being contested at each election. Between its formation in 1974 and the 2003 election, the council varied between control by the Labour Party, and where no one party had an overall majority. From 2003 to 2011 the Conservative Party then held a majority of councillors. At the 2011 election the Conservative Party lost five seats, while Labour gained eight, and afterwards no party held a majority. At the 2019 election, the Conservative Party regained control of the council.

== Demography ==
At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics, the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall had a total resident population of 253,499, of which 123,189 (48.6%) were male and 130,310 (51.4%) were female, with 101,333 households. The Borough occupied at the time of the 2001 census.

Its population density was 22.79 people per hectare compared with an average of 28.41 across the West Midlands metropolitan county. The median age of the population was 37, compared with 36 within the West Midlands metropolitan county and 37 across England and Wales.

The majority of the population of the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall were born in England (91.77%); 1.42% were born elsewhere within the United Kingdom, 0.82% within the rest of the European Union, and 6.00% elsewhere in the world.

Data on religious beliefs across the borough in the 2001 census show that 72.1% declared themselves to be Christian, 10.0% said they held no religion, and 5.4% reported themselves as Muslim. Whereas in the 2011 Census 59% declared themselves to be Christian, 26% said they held no religion or did not state their religion, and 8.2% reported themselves as Muslim.

Within the Metropolitan Borough, 42.84% of households owned a single car or van, with 31.05% owning none. The average car ownership per household was 1.01, compared with 0.96 across the West Midlands metropolitan county.

===Population change===
The table below details the population change in the area since 1801. Although the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall has existed as a metropolitan borough only since 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of the borough.
== Economy ==

At the time of the 2001 census, there were 105,590 people (41.7%) in employment who were resident within Walsall Metropolitan Borough. Of these, 18.60% worked within the wholesale and retail trade, including repair of motor vehicles; 26.44% worked within manufacturing industry; and 9.85% worked within the health and social work sector.

At the 2001 UK census, Walsall Metropolitan Borough had 180,623 residents aged 16 to 74. 2.3% of these people were students with jobs, 6.0% looking after home or family, 6.8% permanently sick or disabled and 2.4% economically inactive for other reasons. These figures are roughly in line with the averages for England, though Metropolitan Borough of Walsall has a higher rate of people who are permanently sick and disabled, where the national average is 5.3%.

The Metropolitan Borough of Walsall is split between several travel to work areas (TTWA). The central and northern areas of the borough (including the towns of Walsall, Bloxwich and Brownhills) are within the Walsall and Cannock TTWA, whilst the majority of the area west of the M6 motorway (including the towns of Willenhall and Darlaston) is within the Wolverhampton TTWA. The southeast of the Metropolitan Borough (including Streetly) is within the Birmingham TTWA. The entire borough is within the Birmingham Larger Urban Zone.

Average house prices in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall were fourth out of the metropolitan boroughs in the West Midlands county, with the average house price within the borough being £131,131 during the period April – June 2009, compared with the average across the Metropolitan County of £128,142. Following transfer from the council in 2003, social housing in the area is primarily managed by WATMOS (consisting of eight Tenant management organisations), and the Walsall Housing Group.

== Transport ==

The A34 trunk road runs directly through the middle of Walsall .

An elevated section of the M6 Motorway built in 1968 half circles around Walsall to the west of the town. There can be increased congestion on the local A roads whenever the motorway is temporarily closed or in a state of serious delay as road users try to bypass the problem. Junctions (North to South) 11, 10, 9 and 7 allow access to and from various parts of the town. The M6 and M5 join at junction 8.

The A454 runs through Walsall on its way to Sutton Coldfield from Bridgnorth.

The Chase Line is a railway line which runs from Birmingham International via Birmingham New Street and Walsall to Rugeley Trent Valley. The following stations on the line are within the Borough:

* Bescot Stadium
* Walsall
* Bloxwich
* Bloxwich North

== Localities ==

&quot; See List of areas in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall.&quot;

== Education ==

45% of pupils in the Borough of Walsall achieved five GCSEs with grades of A*-C, below the national average of 56%.

The borough&#x27;s education format is a traditional 5–7 infant, 7–11 junior and 11-16/18 secondary school system, with some infant and junior schools being combined single site primary schools, while others have infant and junior schools on separate sites. The towns of Walsall, Bloxwich, Darlaston and Willenhall have always used these age ranges, but the Aldridge, Brownhills and Streetly areas (which became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall in 1974) adopted 5–9 first, 9–13 middle and 13-16/18 secondary schools in September 1972. However, this system was discontinued and replaced with the traditional age ranges in September 1986 to fit in with the other schools in the Walsall borough.

<text>Daniel Lindsay Russell Jr. (August 7, 1845May 14, 1908) was an American politician who served as the 49th governor of North Carolina, from 1897 to 1901. An attorney and judge, he had also been elected as state representative and to the United States Congress, serving from 1879 to 1881. Although he fought with the Confederacy during the Civil War, Russell and his father were both Unionists. After the war, Russell joined the Republican Party in North Carolina, which was an unusual affiliation for one of the planter class. In the postwar period he served as a state judge, as well as in the state and national legislatures.

Elected on a fusionist ticket in 1896, a collaboration between Republicans and Populists that was victorious over the Democrats, Russell was the first Republican elected as governor in North Carolina since the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877. During his term, he approved legislation to extend the franchise by reducing the property requirement; it benefited the white majority in the state as well as blacks.

To prevent such a political coalition from being successful again, in the 1898 elections Democrats conducted a campaign of fear, stressing white supremacy, and regained power in the state legislature. Democrats in the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898, which took place in the largest city, overthrew the elected, biracial government headed by a white mayor and majority white council, beginning two days after the election. Russell&#x27;s efforts to suppress the white riot were unsuccessful, and mobs attacked black neighborhoods, driving so many blacks permanently from the city that it became majority white.

The following year Democrats in the state legislature passed a new constitution over Russell&#x27;s opposition and without submitting it to voters. It effectively disfranchised nearly all blacks and many poor whites. As a result, Russell was the last Republican to serve as governor of the state until 1973.

==Early life and education==
Born on Winnabow Plantation in Brunswick County near Wilmington, North Carolina, Russell Jr. was the son of Daniel Lindsay Russell and Elizabeth Caroline Sanders, daughter of a prominent planter family. Following his mother&#x27;s death three months after his birth, Russell Jr. lived at his mother&#x27;s family&#x27;s Palo Alto Plantation for six years before leaving for the Bingham School in Orange County, North Carolina. Russell attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but left soon after the outbreak of the American Civil War. In college he was a member of the Delta Psi fraternity (aka St. Anthony Hall) He was commissioned as a captain in the Confederate Army and served in the war.

==Career==
Russell was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly House of Commons (the lower house of the legislature) in North Carolina General Assembly of 1862-1864 during the Civil War. During that time, he also studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1866. He set up practice in Wilmington. He and his father had both been Union sympathizers during the war, and Russell joined the Republican Party during Reconstruction.

In 1868, Russell was appointed a Superior Court judge in the 4th judicial circuit, a post he held until 1874. In 1871 he was a delegate to a state constitutional convention. In 1876, he was a delegate to the 1876 Republican National Convention, and was again elected to the legislature.

Around this time, the paramilitary white supremacist &quot;Red Shirts&quot; fought to suppress the Republican Party and black voting in North Carolina. Their goal was to gain political control through the Democratic Party.

After the 1876 presidential election, Reconstruction ended and Federal troops were withdrawn from the South. Despite this loss of protection, Republicans and their black supporters remained active in North Carolina.

In 1878, Russell ran for U.S. Representative as a &quot;fusion&quot; candidate of the Republican and Greenback parties. In a close election, he defeated the Democratic incumbent Alfred M. Waddell by 11,611 votes to 10,730. Russell served one term in the 46th United States Congress (March 4, 1879 – March 4, 1881) and did not stand for renomination in 1880.

For the next decade, Russell practiced law and remained active in the Republican party. Then in the 1890s, the new Populist Party appeared. Though in most of the U.S., the Populists were allied with the Democrats, they allied with the Republicans in North Carolina, as common foes of the dominant Democratic Party organization. The alliance ran &quot;fusion&quot; candidates for many offices.

In 1896, the two parties held separate state conventions to allow the Populists to nominate presidential electors pledged to Democrat William J. Bryan. At the Republican state convention in Raleigh on May 16, 1896, Russell was nominated for Governor of North Carolina on the seventh ballot over former U.S. Representative Oliver H. Dockery. Disgruntled, Dockery convinced the Populists to run a separate statewide slate of candidates, with William A. Guthrie for Governor and Dockery for Lieutenant Governor. The Republicans and Populists ran joint candidates for the other state-wide offices.

Despite this breakdown of the alliance, many Populists supported Russell anyway, and some disgruntled Democrats voted for Guthrie. This allowed Russell to win the November 3 election with 153,787 votes (46.5%) to 145,266 votes for Democrat Cyrus B. Watson, 31,143 for Populist William A. Guthrie, and 809 for others. He served one four-year term. The Republican candidate for Lt. Governor was also elected, and the fusion ticket swept the other state-wide offices.

The Republican-Populist alliance had continued in elections to the legislature, and fusionists won control. They extended the franchise for the first time since Reconstruction by reducing property requirements for voters. This benefited many whites, who were the majority in the state, but also blacks. Russell signed the bill. With the broadened franchise, a number of blacks were elected to the legislature and to local government offices.

Although Russell was not up for election in 1898, Democrats used him as a foil in their campaign that year. They attacked him for undermining &quot;white supremacy&quot; and fanned fears of &quot;negro rule&quot;, and regained control of the legislature.

===Wilmington Insurrection of 1898===

On November 8, 1898, a part-black fusion slate won elections in Wilmington, then the state&#x27;s largest city and with a black majority. Alfred Waddell, whom Russell had defeated for Congress in 1878, led thousands of white rioters in the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898; they seized the city government by force, and destroyed the only black-owned newspaper in the state.

The mob went on to attack the city&#x27;s African-American neighborhoods, particularly Brooklyn, killing some people and chasing hundreds out of town. Governor Russell ordered the Wilmington Light Infantry (WLI) and federal Navy Reserves to quell the riot; instead they became involved. Because of the attacks, nearly 2,100 blacks left the city permanently, and its demographics were changed to a white majority.

To prevent &quot;fusionist&quot; coalitions or Republicans winning office again, in 1899 the Democrats used their control of the state legislature to pass an amendment that effectively disenfranchised blacks and many poor whites. As a result, voter rolls dropped dramatically, blacks were excluded from the political system, and the Republican Party was crippled in the state. This condition lasted until the 1960s, when Federal civil-rights legislation restored black voting rights and white Southerners began to abandon their reflexive loyalty to the Democrats.

Russell was the last Republican elected as governor until 1972, when this transformation was well under way.

After finishing his term, Russell resumed the practice of law in Wilmington and operated his Belville Plantation. He died at his plantation near Wilmington in 1908. He was interred in the family burying ground in Onslow County, North Carolina.

<text>John Armstrong Jr. (November 25, 1758April 1, 1843) was an American soldier, diplomat and statesman who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, U.S. Senator from New York, and United States Secretary of War under President James Madison. A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, Armstrong was United States Minister to France from 1804 to 1810.

==Early life==

Armstrong was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the younger son of General John Armstrong Sr. and Rebecca (Lyon) Armstrong. John Sr. was a renowned Pennsylvania soldier born in Ireland of Scottish descent. John Jr.&#x27;s older brother was James Armstrong, who became a physician and U.S. Congressman.

After early education in Carlisle, John Jr. studied at the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University. He broke off his studies in Princeton in 1775 to return to Pennsylvania and join the fight in the Revolutionary War.

==Career==
===Revolutionary War===
The young Armstrong initially joined a Pennsylvania militia regiment and the following year he was appointed as aide-de-camp to General Hugh Mercer of the Continental Army. In this role, he carried the wounded and dying General Mercer from the field at the Battle of Princeton. After the general died on January 12, 1777, Armstrong became an aide to General Horatio Gates. He stayed with Gates through the Battle of Saratoga then resigned due to problems with his health. In 1782 Gates asked him to return. Armstrong joined General Gates&#x27; staff as an aide with the rank of major, which he held through the rest of the war.

===Newburgh letters===
While in camp with Gates at Newburgh, New York, Armstrong became involved in the Newburgh Conspiracy. He is generally acknowledged as the author of the two anonymous letters directed at the officers in the camp. The first, titled &quot;An Address to the Officers&quot; (dated March 10, 1783), called for a meeting to discuss back pay and other grievances with the Congress and form a plan of action. After George Washington ordered the meeting canceled and called for a milder meeting on March 15, a second address appeared that claimed that this showed that Washington supported their actions.

Washington successfully defused this protest without a mutiny. While some of Armstrong&#x27;s later correspondence acknowledged his role, there was never any official action that connected him with the anonymous letters.

===After the revolution===
Later in 1783 Armstrong returned home to Carlisle and became an Original Member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati. He was named the Adjutant General of Pennsylvania&#x27;s militia and also served as Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under Presidents Dickinson and Franklin. In 1784, he led a military force of four hundred militiamen into a controversy with Connecticut settlers in the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania. His tactics enraged the nearby states of Vermont and Connecticut, which sent their own militia into the area. Timothy Pickering was dispatched to forge a solution to the difficulty, and the settlers were able to keep title to the land they had tamed. In 1787 and 1788 Armstrong was sent as a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Congress of the Confederation. The Congress offered to make him chief justice of the Northwest Territory. He declined this, as well as all other public offices for the next dozen years.

Armstrong resumed public life after the resignation of John Laurance as U.S. Senator from New York. As a Jeffersonian Republican he was elected in November 1800 to a term ending in March 1801. He took his seat on November 6, and was re-elected on January 27 for a full term (1801–1807), but resigned on February 5, 1802. DeWitt Clinton was elected to fill the vacancy, but resigned in 1803, and Armstrong was appointed temporarily to his old seat.

In February 1804, Armstrong was elected again to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Theodorus Bailey, thus moving from the Class 3 to the Class 1 seat on February 25, but served only four months before President Jefferson appointed him U.S. Minister to France.

To Paris Armstrong brought as his private secretary the United-Irish exile, David Bailie Warden. After serving as Consul, Warden was to author the first major work of reference for the diplomatic corps; a &quot;pioneering&quot; contribution to &quot;the emergence of doctrinal views and a specialist literature on international law&quot;.

Armstrong served as Minister in Paris until September 1810. In 1806 he had also briefly also represented the United States at the court of Spain.

When the War of 1812 broke out, Armstrong was called to military service. He was commissioned as a Brigadier General, and placed in charge of the defenses for the port of New York. Then in 1813 President Madison named him Secretary of War. He was barely confirmed by the Senate with 18-15 votes.

Henry Adams wrote of him:

&quot;In spite of Armstrong&#x27;s services, abilities, and experience, something in his character always created distrust. He had every advantage of education, social and political connection, ability and self-confidence; he was only fifty-four years old, which was also the age of Monroe; but he suffered from the reputation of and . So strong was the prejudice against him that he obtained only eighteen votes against fifteen in the Senate on his confirmation; and while the two senators from Virginia did not vote at all, the two from Kentucky voted in the negative. Under such circumstances, nothing but military success of the first order could secure a fair field for Monroe&#x27;s rival.&quot;

Armstrong made a number of valuable changes to the armed forces but was so convinced that the British would &#x27;not&#x27; attack Washington D.C. that he did nothing to defend the city even when it became clear it was the objective of the invasion force. After the American defeat at the Battle of Bladensburg and the subsequent burning of Washington, Madison, usually a forgiving man, forced him to resign in September 1814.

===Later life===
Armstrong returned to his farm and resumed a quiet life. He published a number of histories, biographies, and some works on agriculture. He died at La Bergerie (later renamed Rokeby), the farm estate he built in Red Hook, New York in 1843 and is buried in the cemetery in Rhinebeck. Following the death of Paine Wingate in 1838, he became the last surviving delegate to the Continental Congress, and the only one to be photographed.

==Personal life==
In 1789, Armstrong married Alida Livingston (1761–1822), the youngest child of Judge Robert Livingston (1718–1775) and Margaret (née Beekman) Livingston. Alida was also the sister of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston and Edward Livingston. Together they had seven children:

* Maj Horatio Gates Armstrong (1790–1858), soldier in the War of 1812.
* Henry Beekman Armstrong (1791–1854), also a soldier in the War of 1812.
* John Armstrong (1794–1852), who moved to New York and took up life as a gentleman farmer at La Bergerie, a farm purchased from Alida&#x27;s family in Dutchess County
* Robert Livingston Armstrong (1797–1834)
* Margaret Rebecca Armstrong (1800–1872), who married William Backhouse Astor Sr. (1792–1875) of the prominent Astor family.
* James Kosciuszko Armstrong (1801–1868)
* William Armstrong (1814–1902), who married Lucy A. Hickernell (1816–1894).

Armstrong died in Red Hook, New York on April 1, 1843. He was buried at the Rhinebeck Cemetery in Rhinebeck, New York.

===Residences===
====Almont====
Armstrong&#x27;s initial farm in Dutchess County, called &quot;Altmont&quot; (also known as &quot;The Meadows&quot;), was originally part of the Schuyler patent. In 1795, he purchased a part of the farm from the Van Benthuysen family, and converted an existing barn into a two-story Federal style dwelling with twelve rooms. Around 1800, Armstrong sold &quot;Almont&quot; to Andrew and Anna Verplanck Deveaux. Deveaux died in 1812; in 1816 his widow sold &quot;Deveaux Park&quot; to John Stevens. The mansion burned down around 1879. In 1908, lumber rights to the white oak and chestnut forests were sold for timber for the New York market.

====La Bergerie====
After the death of Margaret Beekman Livingston, widow of Judge Robert Livingston, much of the Clermont land was distributed among the heirs. John R. Livingston received the land that would become the &quot;Messena&quot; estate. His sister Alida Livingston Armstrong inherited the property just to the south. There the Armstrong&#x27;s created &quot;La Bergerie&quot;, in English &quot;the sheepfold&quot; – an estate where they raised Merino sheep. The Merino sheep were a gift from the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte on Armstrong&#x27;s departure after being Minister. The Astors purchased it for a summer home and renamed it Rokeby. Margaret Chanler Aldrich, great-granddaughter of Margaret Armstrong Astor, married Richard Aldrich. Rokeby remains in the Aldrich family.

<text>Protiviti Inc. (Protiviti) is a global consulting firm headquartered in Menlo Park and San Ramon, California, that provides consulting in internal audit, risk and compliance, technology, business processes, data analytics and finance. It is a subsidiary under Robert Half. Protiviti and its independently and locally owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of more than 85 locations in over 27 countries.

Protiviti has served more than 80 percent of Fortune 100, nearly 80 percent of Fortune 500 and 70 percent of Fortune 1000 companies. From 2018 to 2022, the firm has been consistently listed by Forbes⁣ as being one of the world&#x27;s best management consulting firms. Protiviti has also been listed as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For by Fortune Magazine for 8 consecutive years from 2015 to 2022.

==History==
Protiviti was formed in 2002 when the Company hired more than 700 professionals who had been affiliated with the internal audit, business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen, including more than 50 individuals who had been partners of that firm. These professionals formed the base of Protiviti.

In 2006, Protiviti acquired the assets of PG Lewis &amp; Associates, a leading national provider of Data Forensics and Cybersecurity services founded in 2003 by serial technology entrepreneur, Paul G. Lewis. Financial terms were not disclosed.

The following year Protiviti acquired the bankruptcy consulting firm PENTA Advisory Services, LLC with locations in Baltimore, Maryland and Richmond, Virginia. PENTA provided restructuring and insolvency services, litigation services and US bankruptcy trustee services. Financial details regarding the transaction were not disclosed.

In 2015, Protiviti acquired Decision First Technologies.

In January 2019, Protiviti expanded its Middle East &amp; North African presence by launching an office in Cairo, Egypt. The new location is the first Member Firm in North Africa, and is led by Managing Director Ashraf Fahmy, a former Deloitte partner in Egypt and with the firm&#x27;s enterprise risk practice in Abu Dhabi.

In February 2019, Protiviti added Gauteng-based internal audit and forensic services firm SekelaXabiso CA (SkX) as its first member firm in South Africa. The new firm will serve domestic firms as well as international firms looking for support to enter the South African market. The firm houses over 200 consultants, and has offices in the major financial centres of Gauteng and Durban.

For fiscal year 2019, Protiviti&#x27;s revenue exceeded US$1 billion for the first time in its 18-year history.

In March 2020, Protiviti expanded its European footprint by opening 3 new offices in Zürich, Switzerland, and Berlin and Düsseldorf, Germany. Protiviti&#x27;s global network of member firms operate as independently owned and operated entities, but have access to the firm&#x27;s resources despite not possessing agency to act on Protiviti&#x27;s behalf.

==Service Expansion==
In March 2022, Protiviti formed a new service line, &quot;Protiviti Digital&quot;, which serves as a digital marketing agency. Protiviti Digital serves clients seeking to execute complex digital and marketing strategies, as well as transform customer experiences.

In April 2022, Robert Half moved its legal consulting service line to Protiviti, which allows Protiviti to expand its legal consulting practice. The service line supports clients with a broader range of legal, compliance, governance, technology, investigation and transaction-related business needs.

<text>Ewe (&quot;Eʋe&quot; or &quot;Eʋegbe&quot; ) is a language spoken by approximately 5 million people in West Africa, mainly in Ghana and Togo. Ewe is part of a group of related languages commonly called the Gbe languages. The other major Gbe language is Fon, which is mainly spoken in Benin. Like many African languages, Ewe is tonal as well as a possible member of the Niger-Congo family.

The German Africanist Diedrich Hermann Westermann published many dictionaries and grammars of Ewe and several other Gbe languages. Other linguists who have worked on Ewe and closely related languages include Gilbert Ansre (tone, syntax), Herbert Stahlke (morphology, tone), Nick Clements (tone, syntax), Roberto Pazzi (anthropology, lexicography), Felix K. Ameka (semantics, cognitive linguistics), Alan Stewart Duthie (semantics, phonetics), Hounkpati B. Capo (phonology, phonetics), Enoch Aboh (syntax), and Chris Collins (syntax).

==Dialects==
Some of the commonly named Ewe (&#x27;Vhe&#x27;) dialects are &quot;Aŋlɔ, Tɔŋu (Tɔŋgu), Avenor, Agave people, Evedome, Awlan, Gbín, Pekí, Kpándo, Vhlin, Hó, Avɛ́no, Vo, Kpelen, Vɛ́, Danyi, Agu, Fodome, Wancé, Wací, Adángbe&quot; (Capo).

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; 16 considers Waci and Kpesi (Kpessi) to be distinct enough to be considered separate languages. They form a dialect continuum with Ewe and Gen (Mina), which share a mutual intelligibility level of 85%; the Ewe varieties Gbin, Ho, Kpelen, Kpesi, and Vhlin might be considered a third cluster of Western Gbe dialects between Ewe and Gen, but Kpesi is as close or closer to the Waci and Vo dialects, which remain in Ewe in that scenario. Waci intervenes geographically between Ewe proper and Gen; Kpesi forms a Gbe island in the Kabye area.

Ewe is itself a dialect cluster of the Gbe languages, which include Gen, Aja, Kotafon, Mina and Xwla and are spoken from the southern part of Ghana to Togo, Benin and Western Nigeria. All Gbe languages share at least some intelligibility with one another. Some coastal and southern dialects of Ewe include Aŋlɔ, Tongu (Tɔŋu), Avenor, Dzodze, and Watsyi. Some inland dialects indigenously characterized as Ewedomegbe include: Ho, Kpedze, Hohoe, Peki, Kpando, Aveme, Liati, Fódome, Danyi, and Kpele. Though there are many classifications, distinct variations exist between towns that are just miles away from one another.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===

&quot;H&quot; is a voiced fricative, which has also been described as uvular, , pharyngeal, , or glottal .

 is typically alveolar as , but can also be dental as .

The nasal consonants are not distinctive since they appear before only nasal vowels; therefore, Ewe is sometimes said to have no nasal consonants. However, it is more economical to argue that nasal are the underlying form and so are denasalized before oral vowels.

 occurs before unrounded (non-back) vowels and before rounded (back) vowels.

Palatalization of alveolar consonants before a high-front vowel occur in the Southern dialect, and are heard as .

Ewe is one of the few languages known to contrast vs. and vs. . The &quot;f&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are stronger than in most languages, and , with the upper lip noticeably raised, and thus more distinctive from the rather weak and .

 may occur in consonant clusters. It becomes (or ) after coronals.

===Vowels===
The tilde (˜) marks nasal vowels, though the Peki dialect lacks . Many varieties of Ewe lack one or another of the front mid vowels, and some varieties in Ghana have the additional vowels and .

Ewe does not have a nasal–oral contrast in consonants. It does, however, have a syllabic nasal, which varies as , depending on the following consonant, and carries tone. Some authors treat it as a vowel, with the odd result that Ewe would have more nasal than oral vowels, and one of these vowels has no set place of articulation. If it is taken to be a consonant, there is the odd result of a single nasal consonant that cannot appear before vowels. If nasal consonants are taken to underlie , however, there is no such odd restriction, and the only difference from other consonants is that only nasal stops may be syllabic, a common pattern cross-linguistically.

===Tones===
Ewe is a tonal language. In a tonal language, pitch differences are used to distinguish one word from another. For example, in Ewe the following three words differ only by tone:

*to ‘ear’ (High tone)
*to ‘report/gossip’(High tone)
*to ‘pound’ (High tone)
* tó &#x27;mountain&#x27; (High tone)
* tǒ &#x27;mortar&#x27; (Rising tone)
* tò &#x27;buffalo&#x27; (Low tone)

Phonetically, there are three tone registers, High, Mid, and Low, and three rising and falling contour tones. However, most Ewe dialects have only two distinctive registers, High and Mid. These are depressed in nouns after voiced obstruents: High becomes Mid (or Rising), and Mid becomes Low. Mid is also realized as Low at the end of a phrase or utterance, as in the example &#x27;buffalo&#x27; above.

In writing, tones are marked by acute accent, grave accent, caron, and circumflex. They may be used along with the tilde that marks nasal vowels.

===Pragmatics===
Ewe has phrases of overt politeness, such as &quot;meɖekuku&quot; (meaning &quot;please&quot;) and &quot;akpe&quot; (meaning &quot;thank you&quot;).

==Orthography==
The African Reference Alphabet is used when Ewe is represented orthographically, so the written version is somewhat like a combination of the Latin alphabet and the International Phonetic Alphabet.
An &quot;n&quot; is placed after vowels to mark nasalization. Tone is generally unmarked, except in some common cases, which require disambiguation: the first person plural pronoun &quot;mí&quot; &#x27;we&#x27; is marked high to distinguish it from the second person plural &quot;mi&quot; &#x27;you&#x27;, and the second person singular pronoun &quot;wò&quot; &#x27;you&#x27; is marked low to distinguish it from the third person plural pronoun &quot;wó&quot; &#x27;they/them&#x27;
* ekpɔ wò — &#x27;he saw you&#x27;
* ekpɔ wo — &#x27;he saw them&#x27;

==Naming system==
The Ewe use a system of giving the first name to a child, based on the day of the week that the child was born. That arises from a belief that the real name of a child can be determined only after the child has shown its character. However, as a child is a person, not an object, the child must be referred to by some name in the interim and so a name is provided based on the day of birth. A final name is given at a naming ceremony, seven days after the date of birth.

As a matter of pride in their heritage, especially since the 1970s, many educated Ewe, who were given Western names, have dropped those names formally/legally or informally and use their birthday name as their official name.

The Ewe birthday-naming system is as follows:

Often, people are called by their birthday name most of the time; the given name being used only on formal documents. In such cases, children with the same birth name are delineated by suffixes: -gã meaning big, -vi meaning little. So for example, after the birth of another Kofi, the first child called Kofi becomes Kofigã, and the new child Kofi. A subsequent Kofi, would be Kofivi, or Kofitse, mostly among Wedome and Tɔngu Ewes. Sometimes, the renaming happens twice, as the second Kofi might have originally been called Kofivi, while the eldest retained Kofi, thereby necessitating that they both be renamed on the birth of a third Kofi.

==Grammar==
Ewe is a subject–verb–object language. The possessive precedes the head noun. Adjectives, numerals, demonstratives and relative clauses follow the head noun. Ewe also has postpositions rather than prepositions.

Ewe is well known as a language having logophoric pronouns. Such pronouns are used to refer to the source of a reported statement or thought in indirect discourse, and can disambiguate sentences that are ambiguous in most other languages. The following examples illustrate:

* Kofi be e-dzo &#x27;Kofi said he left&#x27; (he ≠ Kofi)
* Kofi be yè-dzo &#x27;Kofi said he left&#x27; (he = Kofi)

In the second sentence, yè is the logophoric pronoun.

Ewe also has a rich system of serial verb constructions.

There are also said to be tenses by Warburton (et al. 1968), though most linguists stated that Ewe is an &quot;aspect-prominent language&quot;.

==Status==
Ewe is a national language in Togo and Ghana.

== Literature ==

Scholars have identified &quot;Amegbetoa alo Agbezuge fe nutinya&quot; by Sam J. Obianim as the first novel written in Ewe.

The Fifth landing stage, by Ferdinand Kwasi Fiawoo, a play depicting a part of the history of the Ewe people is a notable literary work as well.

<text>Elias Carr (February 25, 1839 – July 22, 1900) was an American planter, lawyer, and politician who served as the 48th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1893 to 1897.

== Biography ==
Carr was born in Edgecombe County, North Carolina on February 25, 1839, to Jonas Johnston Carr and Elizabeth Jane Hilliard. He was a cousin of the industrialist Julian Carr and an uncle of the anti-suffragist Mary Hilliard Hinton. Carr&#x27;s great-grandfather, Colonel Jonas Johnston, fought in the American Revolutionary War. Carr grew up at Bracebridge Hall, his family&#x27;s plantation. He was raised in the Episcopal faith.

He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1855–1859) and also attained a law degree from the University of Virginia and then returned to Bracebridge Hall. He married Eleanor Kearny, the youngest daughter of William Kinchen Kearny and Benjamin Hardee James Marie Alston Kearny, in 1860 and was the father of six children: Dr. William Kearny Carr, John Buxton Carr, Mary Elizabeth Carr, Elias Carr, Eleanor Kearny Carr, and Annie Bruce Carr. Carr was a member of the board of directors of Rocky Mount Mills, trustee of N.C. College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts (today known as North Carolina State University), commissioner of the N.C. Geological Survey, agriculturist, and businessman. He was an active member of the Sons of the American Revolution and chartered his chapter in North Carolina.

Carr became prominent as head of the state Farmers Alliance and Industrial Union (1889–1892). He was part of a more moderate or conservative faction of the Alliance that opposed splitting from Democrats to form a third party. In 1892, he defeated incumbent Gov. Thomas Michael Holt for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Carr then won the three-way race over the Republican candidate, Judge David M. Furches, and the Populist candidate, Dr. Wyatt P. Exum. Carr did not win an absolute majority of the vote, perhaps foreshadowing the 1894 election, in which Democrats lost control of the legislature to an electoral fusion of Populists and Republicans, and the 1896 election, in which Democrats lost the governor&#x27;s race for the first time since 1872. During his term in office, Carr promoted better school facilities and regulation of railroads. After his governorship, he returned to Bracebridge Hall where he died of a &#x27;thyroid condition&#x27; in July 1900. He is buried in the Carr Cemetery at Bracebridge Hall.

<text>Thomas Michael Holt (July 15, 1831 – April 11, 1896) was an American industrialist who served as the 47th governor of North Carolina from 1891 to 1893. Formerly a North Carolina State Senator and Speaker of the House of the North Carolina General Assembly, Holt was instrumental in the founding of North Carolina State University, as well as in establishing several railroads within the state and the state&#x27;s department of agriculture. Holt was also responsible for the technology behind the family&#x27;s Holt Mills &quot;Alamance Plaids&quot;, the first colored cotton goods produced in the South – a development that revolutionized the Southern textile industry.

Thomas M. Holt AF &amp; AM Masonic Lodge, located in Graham, NC, is named in honor of the former governor.

==Life and career==
Holt was born in Alamance County, North Carolina, on July 15, 1831, the son of Emily Virginia (Farish) and Edwin Michael Holt. Holt was a descendant of Michael Holt or Holdt, one of the earliest settlers of the Germanna Colony in Virginia in the early 18th century. Holt studied at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for one year before briefly moving to work in a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, dry goods store.

In 1858, Thomas and his father acquired Benjamin Trollinger&#x27;s bankrupt textile-manufacturing mill later known as the &quot;Granite Mill&quot; (located in Haw River, North Carolina). In 1861, Thomas acquired his father&#x27;s interest in the mill and moved to Haw River to oversee the mill&#x27;s operations. (Edwin Michael Holt had formerly manufactured the so-called Alamance Plaids, the first cotton goods produced in the South on power looms. Edwin M. Holt established his Alamance Cotton Mill in 1837, thus beginning the Southern textile industry.)

In 1868, Thomas&#x27;s brother-in-law, Adolphus &quot;Dolph&quot; Moore, became business partners with Thomas and the operation was renamed Holt &amp; Moore. In 1876, Moore was murdered, and the mills were consolidated as the Thomas M. Holt Manufacturing Company. (Other members of the Holt family were operating the Haw River Mills, Glencoe Mills, Carolina Mill, Lafayette Mill, the Pilot Mill of Raleigh, and others in their expanding family empire.)

After Thomas&#x27;s death in 1896, his son, Thomas Jr., took over operations of the mills and expanded them. In 1900, the mills were organized by a local labor union, which sponsored a strike that was eventually broken by lockouts and mill housing evictions by the mill management.
Thomas&#x27;s party affiliation was Democratic, and he served as a local magistrate, a county commissioner, as a member of North Carolina&#x27;s state senate (24th District) in 1876, as a member of North Carolina&#x27;s state house of representatives from Alamance County, 1883–87, as the sixth lieutenant governor of North Carolina, 1889–91, and upon the death of governor (Daniel G. Fowle), as 47th governor of North Carolina, 1891–93.

As governor, he was actively involved in establishing a new system of county government, in the construction of the Western North Carolina Railroad and the Cape Fear and Yadkin Valley Railway as well as the North Carolina Railroad, which Holt served as president, as well as in increasing the funding for public schools, the university, and the state hospitals. He pushed for the establishment of an institution for the deaf at Morganton. An outstanding accomplishment was his getting the holders of bonds for the North Carolina Railroad to release the State from the lien on the State&#x27;s shares. This saved the State money as the property was valued at more than $5 million. The Holt family had long ties to the railroad company, and these were undoubtedly useful in Holt&#x27;s striking a deal with the bondholders. Following his service as governor, Holt sat on the boards of both the University of North Carolina and Davidson College.

In 1892, he was defeated by Elias Carr for the Democratic nomination for governor.

Holt was aided in the burgeoning Holt family mill empire by his brother-in-law, James Nathaniel Williamson, who had married Thomas Michael Holt&#x27;s sister Mary. The Holt family eventually became the largest textile barons in the state, running scores of different mills, under various names, and as various Holt heirs and their in-laws broke off from the main enterprise and founded their own companies. Ultimately, however, the Holt mills were sold by the family and became the backbone of the emerging Burlington Mills (later Burlington Industries), overseen by rival industrialist Spencer Love.
Thomas Holt died in Haw River on April 11, 1896.

<text>Daniel Gould Fowle (March 3, 1831April 7, 1891) was the 46th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1889 until his death in 1891. He had served as a state superior court judge from 1865 to 1867.

Fowle was the first governor to live in the governor&#x27;s official residence, and ultimately died. According to popular legend, the ghost of Gov. Fowle has haunted the North Carolina Executive Mansion from time to time.

==Early life==
Fowle was born in Washington, North Carolina to Samuel and Martha March Fowle. Samuel Fowle had moved to North Carolina from Massachusetts in 1815 and was a wealthy merchant. Daniel Fowle attended Bingham Academy, where he finished first in his class, and Princeton University. Upon graduating from Princeton in 1851 he studied law at Richmond Hill Law School and began a practice in Raleigh, North Carolina.

==Civil War==
Fowle was opposed to secession, but he still volunteered as a private in the North Carolina Militia. He was soon appointed major in the commissary branch. He resigned that post and helped to raise the 31st North Carolina Infantry regiment. On September 9, 1861, Fowle was appointed lieutenant colonel of the regiment. In February 1862, Fowle and the 31st NC were captured on Roanoke Island. He was paroled two weeks later. In September 1862, he was defeated in the election for colonel of the regiment and left the Confederate States Army. In October, he was elected to the state legislature representing Wake County, North Carolina. In March 1863, Governor Zebulon B. Vance appointed Fowle adjutant general of North Carolina with the rank of major general. Fowle resigned the post in the fall of 1863 after a disagreement with Vance. Fowle was reelected to the legislature in 1864.

==Post-War==
Fowle returned to his law practice and made a name for himself in the state Democratic Party. In 1868, he was elected as the state chairman of the Democratic Party. In 1880 he was defeated in the gubernatorial election and in 1884 he lost a race for Congress.

==Governor==
Fowle was nominated by the &quot;liberal&quot; faction of the Democratic Party in 1888 and he won the general election. As he was widowed when elected, his daughter Helen Whitaker Fowle Knight served as his first lady. He created a state railroad commission to protect farmers and advocated for education for women. He died while in office and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh.

<text>The following is a list of governors, commodore-governors, and lieutenant governors of Newfoundland and Labrador. Though the present day office of the lieutenant governor in Newfoundland and Labrador came into being only upon the province&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation in 1949, the post is a continuation from the first governorship of Newfoundland in 1610.

==Proprietary governors of Newfoundland, 1610–1728==
==Governors of Plaisance, 1655–1713==
==Lieutenant-governors of Placentia, 1713–1770==
==Commodore-governors of Newfoundland, 1729–1825==
The Commodore-Governor was a British Royal Navy official who was commander of the annual fishing convoy which left England each spring to fish off Newfoundland and was charged with protecting the convoys from harm. He was also responsible for various administrative and judicial functions, including assisting the fishing admirals in maintaining law and order and compiling the annual report on the fishery for the English government. By 1818, the colony had a significant enough permanent population to justify having a resident governor.

==Civil governors of Newfoundland, 1825–1855==
==Colonial governors of Newfoundland, 1855–1907==
==Governors of the Dominion of Newfoundland, 1907–1934==

<doc id="502526" wikidata="Q360815" url="?curid=502526" title="Alfred Moore Scales">
<text>Alfred Moore Scales (November 26, 1827 – February 9, 1892) was a North Carolina state legislator, Confederate general in the American Civil War, and the 45th Governor of North Carolina from 1885 to 1889.

==Early life==
Scales was born at Reidsville, in Rockingham County, North Carolina. He lived on Mulberry Island Plantation. After attending a Presbyterian school, the Caldwell institute and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Scales entered teaching for a time. Later, he studied law with Judge William H. Battle and Judge Settle and then opened a law office in Madison, North Carolina. While at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he was a member of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies.

==Pre-War public service==
Scales was elected county solicitor in 1852. He was elected four times to the North Carolina state legislature and served as chairman of the Finance Committee. In 1854, he ran a close but unsuccessful race as the Democratic candidate for United States Congress in a Whig district. In 1857, he was elected to Congress but was defeated for re-election two years later. From 1858 until the spring of 1861, he held the office of clerk and master of the court of equity of Rockingham County. In 1860, he was an elector for the Breckinridge ticket and subsequently involved in the debate over North Carolina&#x27;s secession.

==Civil War service==

===Early military service===
All of Alfred Scales&#x27;s Civil War service was with Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia. Soon after the call for troops from Washington he volunteered as a private in the North Carolina service, but was at once elected captain of his company, H of the 13th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, and was elected to succeed General William Dorsey Pender as colonel on November 14, 1862. He was engaged at Yorktown and the Battle of Williamsburg in the Peninsula Campaign, and in the Seven Days Battles near Richmond. After Malvern Hill, he collapsed from exhaustion and came near to death. His superior, Brig. Gen. Samuel Garland, Jr., said in his report that Scales was &quot;conspicuous for his fine bearing. Seizing the colors of his regiment at a critical moment at Cold Harbor and advancing to the front, he called on the 13th to stand to them, thus restoring confidence and keeping his men in position.&quot; It took him until November to recuperate so he missed the battles of both Second Manassas and Antietam, but returned in time for the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.

During the winter of 1862–63, the 35-year-old colonel married 18-year-old Kate Henderson. She was the daughter of a prominent family from Gaston County, North Carolina.

At Fredericksburg, in December 1862, Scales temporarily took command of the brigade after General Pender fell wounded. Pender turned over the command during a federal assault, saying to him, &quot;Drive those scoundrels out&quot;. Scales promptly ordered Major C. C. Cole of the 22nd North Carolina to dislodge the enemy, which A.P. Hill reported was &quot;handsomely done.&quot;

Scales again served with distinction during the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, where he was wounded in the thigh, continuing on the field until loss of blood forced him to leave. It was to his regiment that General Pender said, &quot;I have nothing to say to you but to hold you all up as models in duty, courage and daring.&quot; In his official report Pender referred to Colonel Scales as &quot;a man as gallant as is to be found in the service.&quot;

===Gettysburg Campaign===
While at home recovering from his wound, he was promoted to brigadier general on June 13, 1863, and upon his return was assigned to the command of Pender&#x27;s old brigade when Pender was promoted to the command of A.P. Hill&#x27;s Light Division. In the first day&#x27;s fight at Gettysburg with Pender&#x27;s Division, it was the attack of his brigade that helped pave the way for Abner M. Perrin&#x27;s brigade to break through the Union line on Seminary Ridge and force the enemy to retreat toward Cemetery Hill.

During this attack, Scales&#x27;s Brigade suffered heavy casualties. He personally fought with gallantry, and was severely wounded in the leg by a shell fragment on Seminary Ridge. Every field officer of his brigade was killed or wounded except two, and his brigade, already reduced by its losses at Chancellorsville, lost nearly 550 men out of the 1,350 engaged.

On the second day at Gettysburg, the brigade was only engaged in skirmishing, but on the third day of battle it participated in Pickett&#x27;s Charge. Half of General Pender&#x27;s division, James Lane&#x27;s and Scales&#x27;s brigades advanced in the charge with Pickett&#x27;s and Pettigrew&#x27;s divisions. Since Pender had been wounded, his two brigades in the charge were placed under the command of Major General Isaac R. Trimble. Due to Scales&#x27;s wounding, his brigade was commanded during the charge by Colonel William Lee J. Lowrance. Elements of this brigade were among the Confederates to advance farthest in the unsuccessful charge.

With General Pender at his side, Scales rode back to Virginia in an ambulance, and after being left at Winchester, he recovered enough from his wounds to be returned to service; however, General Pender died from his wounds.

===Military service after Gettysburg===
After returning to service upon the apparent recovery from his wound, Scales participated in the campaigns of the Army of Northern Virginia during 1864 including the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and the Siege of Petersburg. Due to his previous wounds being unhealed, Scales took a leave of absence late in the war, and was at home in North Carolina when the army surrendered at Appomattox Court House. There is no record that the general was ever formally paroled, but he applied for amnesty at Raleigh on June 22, 1865, and was pardoned on June 18, 1866.

==Post-War public service==


After the war, Scales returned to the practice of law, a profession in which he gained great distinction. In 1874 he was elected to the Forty-fourth Congress, and was re-elected to the four succeeding congresses. In 1884, he was elected Governor of North Carolina by a majority of over twenty thousand votes. Upon the expiration of his term as governor in 1888 he retired permanently from political life, repeatedly refusing to run again for Congress. In 1888 Scales left the governorship and was elected president of the Piedmont Bank at Greensboro, and served as its president until he died.

Scales was never in good health after leaving the governorship in 1888. His condition was diagnosed as Bright&#x27;s disease, causing his brain to become so affected that during the last months of his life, he was only conscious for short intervals. He died in Greensboro and was buried there at the Green Hill Cemetery.

Alfred Scales was greatly beloved and respected by all. Noted historian Douglas S. Freeman, in discussing eight promotions to brigadier general Lee needed to make after Chancellorsville said, &quot;One promotion was a matter of course. ...&quot; and then mentioned Scales first of the eight. At the time of his death all the businesses in Greensboro closed and the entire city turned out to attend his funeral. His family life was always pleasant. He was survived by his wife, Kate, and his daughter, Mrs. John Noble Wyllie.

The Alfred Moore Scales Law Office at Madison was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

<doc id="502527" wikidata="Q487027" url="?curid=502527" title="Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five">
<text>The Hot Five was Louis Armstrong&#x27;s first jazz recording band led under his own name.

It was a typical New Orleans jazz band in instrumentation, consisting of trumpet, clarinet, and trombone backed by a rhythm section. The original New Orleans jazz style leaned heavily on collective improvisation, in which the three horns together played the lead: the trumpet played the main melody, and the clarinet and trombone played improvised accompaniments to the melody. This tradition was continued in the Hot Five, but because of Armstrong&#x27;s creative gifts as a trumpet player, solo passages by the trumpet alone began to appear more frequently. In these solos, Armstrong laid down the basic vocabulary of jazz improvisation and became its founding and most influential exponent.

The Hot Five was organized at the suggestion of Richard M. Jones for Okeh Records. All their records were made in Okeh&#x27;s recording studio in Chicago, Illinois. The same personnel recorded a session made under the pseudonym &quot;Lil&#x27;s Hot Shots&quot; for Vocalion/Brunswick (their first electrically recorded session). While the musicians in the Hot Five played together in other contexts, as the Hot Five they were a recording studio band that performed live only for two parties organized by Okeh.

There were two different groups called &quot;Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five&quot;, the first recording from 1925 through 1927 and the second in 1928; Armstrong was the only musician in both groups. After 1925, the Hot Five maintained a recording schedule of about three sessions per year.

== The first Hot Five ==
The original Hot Five were Armstrong&#x27;s wife, pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, as well as New Orleans musicians who Armstrong had worked with in that city in the 1910s: Kid Ory on trombone, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, and Johnny St. Cyr on guitar and banjo. For some or all of the Louis Armstrong and His Hot Seven sides, Ory was in New York City working with King Oliver&#x27;s band, and was replaced, probably by John Thomas. The first Hot Five sides, &quot;Yes! I&#x27;m in the Barrel&quot;, composed by Armstrong, &quot;My Heart&quot; composed by Hardin Armstrong, and &quot;Gut Bucket Blues&quot; attributed to Armstrong, were recorded on November 12, 1925, with little rehearsal. The next session occurred on February 22, 1926, with the recording of &quot;Come Back, Sweet Papa,&quot; composed by New Orleanian Paul Barbarin and Panamanian Luis Russell. The Hot Five&#x27;s success was solidified as a result of the third session on February 26, 1926, which produced &quot;Oriental Strut,&quot; &quot;Georgia Grind,&quot; &quot;Cornet Chop Suey,&quot; &quot;Muskrat Ramble,&quot; &quot;Heebie Jeebies,&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Next.&quot; In particular, &quot;Heebie Jeebies,&quot; featuring Armstrong&#x27;s famous scat chorus, made Armstrong a local celebrity in Chicago; it also became featured and advertised for Chicago&#x27;s white market. 

As a result of the Hot Five&#x27;s new fame, Okeh offered a five-year contract and brought them back into the studio on June 16, 1926, and June 23, 1926. The next highly successful session occurred in December 1927, producing the famous &quot;Struttin&#x27; With Some Barbeque.&quot; In this session, Lonnie Johnson was added on guitar and vocals for the songs &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rough,&quot; &quot;Savoy Blues,&quot; and &quot;Hotter Than That.&quot; &quot;Hotter Than That,&quot; in the words of Thomas Brothers, is a piece turned &quot;into a vehicle for their hometown bag of heartfelt musical tricks — a stunning passage of polymetric tension, rigorous commitment to the fixed and variable model, microphone-aided scat, vehement attack, vocal inflections on the guitar, plaintive dialogue, timbral diversity, and... collective improvisation.&quot;

The ensemble passages are frequently effective, and the genius of Armstrong&#x27;s cornet or trumpet playing touch virtually every recording. Some of the more important examples are &quot;Cornet Chop Suey&quot;, &quot;Muskrat Ramble&quot;, &quot;Hotter Than That&quot; and &quot;Struttin&#x27; with Some Barbecue&quot;.

== The 1928 Hot Five ==
In 1928, Armstrong revamped the recording band, replacing everyone but himself with members of the Carroll Dickerson Orchestra, in which Armstrong was playing: Fred Robinson on trombone, Jimmy Strong on clarinet and tenor saxophone, Earl Hines on piano, Mancy Carr (not &quot;Cara&quot; as has often been misprinted) on banjo, and Zutty Singleton on drums.

The 1928 Hot Five played music that was specifically arranged as opposed to the more freewheeling improvised passages of the earlier Hot Five. A tentative movement toward the kind of fully arranged horn sections that would dominate swing music a decade later was starting to become fashionable, and this second Armstrong group embraced a rudimentary version of it, with Don Redman as arranger providing some written-out section parts. Strong on clarinet and Robinson on trombone were not as strong soloists as Dodds and Ory had been with the earlier band, but Hines was more nearly Armstong&#x27;s equal technically and creatively than any other in either band.

Thus, these sessions resulted in some of the most important masterpieces of early jazz, of which &quot;West End Blues&quot; is arguably the best known. Other important recordings include &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot;, &quot;Tight Like This&quot;, &quot;Saint James Infirmary&quot;, and &quot;Weather Bird&quot;. In the last named, only Armstrong and Hines are present, turning an old rag number into a tour-de-force duet.

<doc id="502529" wikidata="Q885633" url="?curid=502529" title="Thomas J. Jarvis">
<text>Thomas Jordan Jarvis (January 18, 1836June 17, 1915) was the 44th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1879 to 1885. Jarvis served as a U.S. Senator from 1894 to 1895. A white supremacist, he spoke and wrote widely in support of the white supremacy campaign of 1898. In 1907, he helped establish East Carolina Teachers Training School, now known as East Carolina University.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Born in Jarvisburg, North Carolina, in Currituck County, he was the son of Elizabeth Daley and Bannister Hardy Jarvis, a Methodist minister and farmer and brother of George, Ann, Margaret, and Elizabeth. His family was of English descent; ancestors included Thomas Jarvis, lieutenant governor of Albemarle during the government of Philip Ludwell between 1691 and 1697; and Samuel Jarvis, who led the militia of Albemarle during his fight in the Revolutionary War. Jarvis&#x27;s father owned a 300-acre farm, where the family &quot;had the necessities of life but few of the luxuries&quot;. Jarvis was educated in local schools and at 19 went on to attend Randolph-Macon College, earning an M.A. in 1861. He had to exercise as teacher during the summer to pay for college tuition. An educator by training, Jarvis opened a school in Pasquotank County.

=== Career ===

Jarvis enlisted in the military at the beginning of the American Civil War and served in the Eighth North Carolina Regiment. On April 22, 1863, he was named Captain. Captured and exchanged in 1862, Jarvis was injured and permanently disabled at the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff in 1864. After the war ended, he was on sick leave in Norfolk and in May 1865, he got probation, returning to Jarvisburg.

In 1865, Jarvis returned home and opened a general store with entrepreneur William H. Happer; he was later named a delegate to the state&#x27;s constitutional convention that year. In 1867, Jarvis bought out Happer, but after getting a license to practice law in June of that year, he abandoned the store and moved to Columbia.

Active in the Democratic Party, Jarvis was elected to the State House in 1868 and served there for four years, two of them (1870–1872) as Speaker of the House. In 1872, he was a Democratic elector-at-large on the Horace Greeley ticket. Jarvis also married Mary Woodson in December 1874.

An opponent of federal Reconstruction policy, Jarvis was elected the third lieutenant governor in 1876 on a ticket with Zebulon Vance. In 1879, Vance resigned the governorship to serve in the United States Senate, and Jarvis filled the vacant position. As governor, he fought against government corruption and attempted to cut taxes, the state&#x27;s debt, and government control. He also completed the sale of various state railways to private companies. He established mental health services in Morganton and Goldsboro, managed the establishment of normal schools for teachers in North Carolina and helped develop the State Board of Health.

He won election in his own right in 1880, defeating Daniel G. Fowle for the Democratic nomination and narrowly winning over Republican challenger Ralph Buxton. In office, Jarvis convinced the legislature to authorize construction of the North Carolina Executive Mansion, although it was not completed until 1891. He &quot;supported establishing a system of county superintendents of education elected by boards of education, grades of teacher certification, standards of examinations for public school teachers, and lists of recommended textbooks. Also, Funds for the mental institutions continued to increase, and the laws of North Carolina were for the first time codified and state insurance laws fully defined. Also, was built a governor&#x27;s mansion&quot;.

Term limited, Jarvis stepped down as governor in 1885, but was appointed United States Minister to Brazil by President Grover Cleveland. Jarvis held this post for four years, after which he practiced law in Greenville, North Carolina. After Senator Vance died in 1894, Jarvis again succeeded him in office, serving as a U.S. Senator through an appointment by Gov. Elias Carr. In 1895, the state legislature, now under the control of Republicans and Populists, did not elect Jarvis to a term of his own.

In 1896, Jarvis was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, where he supported William Jennings Bryan in his last major political act. 

In 1898, Jarvis participated in the state&#x27;s white supremacy campaign, speaking widely on behalf of the movement and writing a widely syndicated newspaper essay criticizing the Fusion movement and denouncing Greenville’s African-American-dominated town council. While not directly involved, Jarvis&#x27;s political rhetoric may have contributed to the Wilmington insurrection of 1898, a violent &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by white supremacists. They expelled opposition black and white political leaders from the city, destroyed the property and businesses of black citizens built up since the Civil War, including the only black newspaper in the city, and killed an estimated 60 to more than 300 people.

Jarvis was instrumental in the 1907 founding of what is now East Carolina University in Greenville, where the oldest residential hall on campus is named in his memory.

He reopened his law firm and in 1912, he founded a partnership with Frank Wooten. In November 1914, Jarvis presided over the unveiling of the Pitt County Confederate Soldiers&#x27; Monument. 

He died at his home in Greenville on June 17, 1915.

== Legacy ==
* In addition to the ECU residence hall, a local United Methodist church and a street in Greenville are named in his memory. 
* At one time, several personal artifacts were on display at the church.

== Personal life ==
Jarvis married Mary Woodson in December 1874.

<doc id="502534" wikidata="Q541244" url="?curid=502534" title="Hereditary spherocytosis">
<text>Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a congenital hemolytic disorder wherein a genetic mutation coding for a structural membrane protein phenotype causes the red blood cells to be sphere-shaped (spherocytosis), rather than the normal biconcave disk shape. This abnormal shape interferes with the cells&#x27; ability to flex during blood circulation, and also makes them more prone to rupture under osmotic stress, mechanical stress, or both. Cells with the dysfunctional proteins are degraded in the spleen, which leads to a shortage of erythrocytes and results in hemolytic anemia.

HS was first described in 1871, and is the most common cause of inherited hemolysis in populations of northern European descent, with an incidence of 1 in 5000 births. The clinical severity of HS varies from mild (symptom-free carrier), to moderate (anemic, jaundiced, and with splenomegaly), to severe (hemolytic crisis, in-utero hydrops fetalis), because HS is caused by genetic mutations in a multitude of structural membrane proteins and exhibits incomplete penetrance in its expression.

Early symptoms include anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and fatigue. Acute cases can threaten to cause hypoxia secondary to anemia and acute kernicterus through high blood levels of bilirubin, particularly in newborns. Most cases can be detected soon after birth. Testing for HS is available for the children of affected adults. Occasionally, the disease will go unnoticed until the child is about 4 or 5 years of age. A person may also be a carrier of the disease and show no signs or symptoms of the disease. Late complications may result in the development of pigmented gallstones, which is secondary to the detritus of the broken-down blood cells (unconjugated or indirect bilirubin) accumulating within the gallbladder. Also, patients who are heterozygous for a hemochromatosis gene may exhibit iron overload, despite the hemochromatosis genes being recessive. In chronic patients, an infection or other illness can cause an increase in the destruction of red blood cells, resulting in the appearance of acute symptoms – a &quot;hemolytic crisis&quot;. On a blood smear, Howell-Jolly bodies may be seen within red blood cells. Primary treatment for patients with symptomatic HS has been total splenectomy, which eliminates the hemolytic process, allowing for normal hemoglobin, reticulocyte and bilirubin levels. The resultant asplenic patient is susceptible to encapsulated bacterial infections, the risk of which can be reduced with vaccination. If other symptoms such as abdominal pain persist, the removal of the gallbladder may be warranted for symptomatic cholelithiasis.

== Epidemiology ==
Hereditary spherocytosis is the heritable hemolytic disorder, affecting 1 in 2,000 people of Northern European ancestry. According to &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Principles of Internal Medicine&quot;, the frequency is at least 1 in 5,000 within the United States of America. While HS is most commonly (though not exclusively) found in Northern European and Japanese families, an estimated 25% of cases are due to spontaneous mutations.

== Etiology ==
Hereditary spherocytosis is an erythrocytic disorder of that affects the following red cell membrane proteins in a congenital fashion:

* Spectrin (alpha and beta)
* Ankyrin
* Band-3 protein
* Protein-4.2
* Lesser proteins of significance

Hereditary spherocytosis can be an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant trait. The autosomal recessive inheritance pattern accounts for close to 25% of the clinical cases. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern accounts for over 75% of the clinical cases. Many positive individuals will not present clinically, thus the etiologic data may be artificially skewed towards the more prominent dominant forms. These dominant forms tend to leave a family history that yields generational splenectomies and black gallstones cholelithiasis. Lastly, an estimated 25% of cases are due to spontaneous mutations.

==Pathophysiology==

=== Causative genetic mutations and phenotypic expressions ===
Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in the genes that code for the red blood cell proteins spectrin (alpha and beta), ankyrin, band 3 protein, protein 4.2, and other red blood cell membrane proteins:

&quot;*Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). The Alpha-1 refers the alpha-1 subunit of the spectrin protein. The Beta refers the beta subunit of the spectrin protein.&quot;

These genetic mutations are acted upon and executed by erythrocyte progenitor cells within the bone marrow, where red blood cells are normally produced in the non-pathological state (see Extramedullary hematopoiesis for pathological production outside of the bone marrow).

=== Pathophysiology of mutated erythrocytic membrane proteins ===
These proteins are necessary to maintain the normal shape of a red blood cell, which is a biconcave disk. The integrating protein that is most commonly defective is spectrin which is responsible for incorporation and binding of spectrin to the greater actin cytoskeleton. This dysfunction of cytoskeletal instabilities ensue, and leave the plasma membrane of the cell less supported and/or weakened.

=== Cellular implications ===
A secondary defect in hereditary spherocytosis is a deficiency of membrane surface area. The decrease in surface area leads to less efficient gas exchange of the erythrocyte at the alveoli of the lungs and throughout circulation. Decreased surface area may be produced by two different mechanisms:

# Defects of spectrin, ankyrin (most commonly), or PROTEIN 4.2 lead to reduced structural integrity of the plasma membrane, destabilizing the overlying lipid bilayer, and releasing band 3-containing microvesicles. Band-3 is important for gas exchange (as seen above).
# Defects of band 3 lead to band 3 deficiency and loss of its lipid-stabilizing effect within the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. This results in the release of band 3-free microvesicles.

Both pathways result in compromised plasma membrane integrity, decreased surface area, and formation of spherocytes with decreased mechanical compliance during circulation.

=== Cardiovascular and organ sequelae ===
Spherocytes have less plasma membrane compliance and fluidity, and this has implications throughout the entirety of circulation within the body, i.e. arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, veins, and organs. The lack of compliance and fluidity lead to a higher viscosity value for blood (thickened blood), which can have implications for both larger and smaller diameter vasculature. However, the most pronounced issues with the lack of compliance and fluidity declare themselves in the failure of the erythrocyte to deform itself when transiting arterioles, capillary beds, and venules. These vessels are smaller, and can become congested or blocked altogether. Studies have demonstrated that HS is related to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and arterial cardiovascular disease for this reason.

The spleen typically acts as a filter for blood, and targets pathogens and other damaged cells within circulation. Removing blood contaminants promotes entire-body homeostasis. The following facts about the spleen&#x27;s role in normal body functioning are crucial to understanding the implications of HS on the overall health of the individual:

* Removal of pathogens includes encapsulated bacteria, which reduces sepsis risk (see § Complications below).
* Removal of damaged erythrocytes reduces iron burden from heme via hepatosplenic recycling, which reduces sepsis risk (see Complications below).
* Removal of damaged erythrocytes continues healthy signaling to bone marrow, where erythropoiesis replaces red blood cells lost to wear and tear.

In relation to the three facts above, the spleen misguidedly filters spherocytes – regardless of the age or functional status of the cell. The spleen is not dysfunctional itself when selecting spherocytes for destruction, as this is the regular function of the spleen both at an anatomic structure level, and at the molecular cellular level. At the anatomic level, the passage from the cords of Billroth into the sinusoids may be seen as a &quot;bottleneck&quot;, where red blood cells need to be flexible in order to pass through. In HS, the erythrocytes fail to pass through fenestrations, and this is where resident splenic macrophages sample, or &quot;bite&quot;, part of the stuck spherocytes&#x27; plasma membranes. The macrophages recognize that the spherocyte is not normal, and the macrophage is &quot;programmed&quot; to destroy irregularities filtered at the spleen from the blood. The resident splenic macrophages therefore phagocytose the spherocytes, causing extravascular hemolysis. This leads to both splenomegaly and anemia. Should this process continue unchecked chronically, inappropriate regulation of erythropoiesis leads to extramedullary hematopoiesis.

==Clinical presentation==
HS patients present in a vast array of presentations, from being asymptomatic to the extreme situations of splenic rupture, hemolytic crisis, or in-utero demise.

* Asymptomatic HS (mild): 20–30% of patients.
* Infantile-onset HS (moderate): 60–75% of patients.
* Neonatal or in-utero onset HS (severe): &lt;5% of patients.

The most common presentation will demonstrate jaundice (due to increased unconjugated bilirubin), anemia (with secondary pallor) and a palpable spleen, sometimes with concomitant tenderness (due to splenic congestion and splenomegaly). It is worth noting that a subsection of HS patients will also have incidental black pigmented gallstones made of calcium bilirubinate (a consequence of the extravascular hemolysis), and some of these patients will develop cholelithiasis or the potential complex sequelae of this condition (e.g. cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, etc).

==Diagnostics==

=== Laboratory testing ===
Available lab testing that may aid in the diagnosis of HS is as follows:

* Peripheral blood smear
* Supportive blood work: mean cell volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), red blood cell count (RBC), reticulocytes, unconjugated bilirubin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
* Eosin-5-maleimide binding test
* Osmotic fragility test
* Acidified glycerol lysis test
* A negative direct antiglobin test (Coombs test)

=== Common laboratory findings ===
The common findings of lab testing in setting of a patient with hereditary spherocytosis:

* Coombs test: Negative (rules-out autoimmune hemolytic anemia)
* Osmotic fragility test: Positive (Spherocytes will rupture in liquid solutions less concentrated than the inside of the red blood cell. This is due to increased permeability of the spherocyte membrane to salt and water, which enters the concentrated inner environment of the RBC and leads to its rupture. The osmotic fragility test is no longer considered the gold standard for diagnosing hereditary spherocytosis, as it misses ~25% of cases).
* Acidified glycerol lysis test: Positive (A newer version of the osmotic fragility test that adds glycerol to a hypotonic solution. This produces lysis, a positive test, quicker that the traditional saline version).
* Supportive blood work: 
** Mean cell volume (MCV): Normocytic (normal range: 80–100 fL), or slightly lower. Spherocytes are slightly smaller than normal biconcave red blood cells.
** Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC): Increased (normal range: 31–36% Hb/cell). This is secondary to less water being in the cell.
** Red blood cell distribution width (RDW): Increased (normal range: 11–15%). The spherocytes create variation in the size of the red blood cells on average, thus expanding the distribution.
** Red blood cell count (RBC): Sometimes increased early (normal range males: 4.3–5.9 million/mm3; normal range females: 3.5–5.5 million/mm3). The loss of surface area per cells cause the body to mass produce red blood cells. The spleen will filter spherocytes out and change this value.
** Reticulocytes: Increased (normal range: 0.5–1.5% of the RBC listed above). The body to mass produces red blood cells (reticulocytes being young erythrocytes) even as the spleen filters spherocytes out. This is known as reticulocytosis. 
** Unconjugated bilirubin: Increased (normal range: 0.2–1.2 mg/dL). This is caused by heme released into the hepatosplenic circulation by macrophages that have phagocytosed erythrocytes. The unconjugated bilirubin is not soluble in water (blood), so it binds to albumin, and is processed in the liver.
** Haptoglobin (free): Decreased (normal range: 41–165 mg/dL). This is caused by hemoglobin binding to haptoglobin, thus making it no longer &quot;free&quot;.
** Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): Increased (normal range: 110–295 U/L in children). This is due to extravascular hemolysis.
* Peripheral blood smear: Directly shows spherocytes on microscope.
* Eosin-5-maleimide binding test: Positive (reduced mean fluorescence), as the test will demonstrate a reduced ability of the eosin-5-maleimide dye to bind to erythrocyte plasma membrane proteins. The process relies upon flow cytometry. Gold standard test that produces results at low cost within ~2 hours. 
In chronic cases, patients who have taken iron supplementation, have heterozygous hemochromatosis, or received numerous blood transfusions, iron overload may cause additional health issues. Measuring iron stores is sometimes considered part of the diagnostic approach to hereditary spherocytosis in older patients presenting with heart muscle damage of unknown etiology or liver disease without apparent cause.

=== Imaging ===
Ultrasound is often used to evaluate the dimensions of the spleen, and also the gallbladder in preparation for functionally curative splenectomy with or without cholecystectomy.

==Treatment==
Although research is ongoing, currently there is no genetic-level cure for the myriad of mutations that cause the various presentations of hereditary spherocytosis. Common current management focuses on interventions prevent the body from inappropriately destroying the functional spherocytes produced by erythrocyte progenitor cells within the bone marrow.

Typical treatment options include:
* Splenectomy (operative): This is the operative removal of the entire spleen by a surgeon, thus stopping the extravascular hemolysis, but also removing the immune functions that the spleen naturally provides to the body.
* Partial splenectomy (operative): This is when only a section of the spleen is removed, instead of the entire organ. The goal is to lower the extravascular hemolysis to a level compatible with homeostasis of the patient, while preserving the immune function of the spleen&#x27;s presence. Research on outcomes is currently ongoing, and is routine at children&#x27;s hospitals within the United States of America.
* Splenic ablation (interventional radiology): This option is non-operative, and is when an interventional radiologist (instead of a surgeon) uses radiologic techniques to coil or cauterize vasculature within the splenic circulation. There are various points in the circulatory pathway where the treatment can be applied to produces varying amounts of retained viability of the spleen, thus giving the option to attempt to preserve splenic immune function.
All operative and interventional treatments require the immunization of HS patients against the influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and encapsulated bacteria such as &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and meningococcus. Antibiotics are no longer recommended for maintenance use, even in post-splenectomy HS patients. Since the spleen is important for protecting against encapsulated organisms, sepsis caused by encapsulated organisms is a possible complication of splenectomy.

Additional elective treatments offered: 
* Surgical removal of the gallbladder.
Experimental treatment:

* Bone marrow transplant (heme-oncology intervention): The replacement of the bone marrow with bone marrow from an individual without spherocytosis. The transplanted progenitor cells do not have the genetic mutations found in individuals with hereditary spherocytosis, and therefore do not produce spherocytes. This results in an individual with biconcave-disc-shaped erythrocytes. This treatment is not standard of care, and is not offered as it has only been documented incidentally during treatment for other diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndrome.

Symptomatic treatments:

* Folic acid supplementation.

== Complications ==

=== Common complications ===

* Hemolytic crisis, with more pronounced jaundice due to accelerated hemolysis (may be precipitated by infection).
* Aplastic crisis with dramatic fall in hemoglobin level and (reticulocyte count)-decompensation, usually due to maturation arrest and often associated with megaloblastic changes; may be precipitated by infection, such as influenza, notably with parvovirus B19.
* Folate deficiency caused by increased bone marrow requirement.
* Pigmented gallstones occur in approximately half of untreated patients. Increased hemolysis of red blood cells leads to increased bilirubin levels, because bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme. The high levels of bilirubin must be excreted into the bile by the liver, which may cause the formation of a pigmented gallstone, which is composed of calcium bilirubinate. Since these stones contain high levels of calcium carbonates and phosphate, they are radiopaque and are visible on x-ray.
* Hyperglycemia with concomitant low hemoglobin A1C levels. 
** Hemoglobin A1C (glycated hemoglobin) is a test for determining the average blood glucose levels over an extended period of time, and is often used to evaluate glucose control in diabetics. The hemoglobin A1C levels are abnormally low because the life span of the red blood cells is decreased - providing less time for the non-enzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin. Thus, even with high overall blood sugar, the A1C will be lower than expected.
* Iron overload.
* Leg ulcer.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
* Cardiovascular disease.

==Research==
Modern ongoing research interests:

* Experimental gene therapy exists to treat hereditary spherocytosis in lab mice; however, this treatment has not yet been tried on humans due to all of the risks involved in human gene therapy.
* Bone marrow transplant.
* Paradoxical endurance-based athleticism associated with hereditary spherocytosis.
* Evolution of spherocytic erythrocyte adaptation in those of Northern European and Japanese descent.
* Increased ability to defend against viral infections in hereditary spherocytosis patients.

<text>Ocular evisceration is the removal of the eye&#x27;s contents, leaving the scleral shell and extraocular muscles intact. The procedure is usually performed to reduce pain, improve cosmetic appearance in a blind eye, treat cases of endophthalmitis unresponsive to antibiotics, or in the case of ocular trauma. An ocular prosthetic can be later fitted over the eviscerated eye in order to improve cosmetic appearance.

Background

Evisceration is a surgical procedure that involves the removal the eye&#x27;s contents while leaving the white part of the eye (the scleral shell) and extraocular muscles in place. Evisceration differs from enucleation, as enucleation involves the removal of the scleral shell as well. Evisceration was first described by Bear in 1817 as an experimental treatment for expulsive hemorrhage, and with the advent of general anesthesia in the 1840’s the procedure was refined and ocular implants were developed.

Indications

Evisceration involves disrupting the integrity of the globe, and therefore is not typically used in patients with intraocular cancers as it may risk spreading cancerous cells to other parts of the body. The most common indications for evisceration include a blind painful eye, trauma, or infection. 

Pre-Operative Evaluation 

Prior to surgery, the eye must be carefully examined by an ophthalmologist to check for ocular cancer or other conditions that may complicate the procedure. If the back of the eye cannot be visualized, then a CT scan should be performed. If neither clinical evaluation nor imaging can rule out cancer, then enucleation may be considered as an alternative to prevent the possibility of malignant spread. 

Surgical Technique

The surgery is performed in the operating room typically under general anesthesia, however it can also be conducted using local anesthesia with sedation. Procedure time is typically one to two hours.

Prior to surgery, the correct eye must be marked and verified. The patient is anesthetized, the field is sterilized, then draped in a sterile manner. An eyelid speculum is placed to keep the eyelids open during the surgery. The procedure begins with a 360° periotomy followed by a stab incision in the sclera. The incision is then expanded around the limbus circumferentially and the orbital contents are removed using an evisceration spoon. The optic disc is then cauterized and the scleral shell is cleaned. A spherical implant is then inserted into the scleral shell and the shell is sutured together, encasing the implant. The intraocular contents may be sent for pathological examination once removed. 

Post-Operation

After the surgery, strenuous physical activity should be avoided until cleared by a physician. Contaminated bodies of water, such as pools, lakes, and the ocean should be avoided. The surgeon will typically provide instructions on bathing, as tap water may also be contaminated.

Post-operative pain may be controlled with either prescription medications or over the counter pain relievers. Some patients may be given steroids or antibiotics depending on the indication for the surgery and surgeon preference.

Prostheses

Once the operating surgeon determines that the orbit has healed adequately, an ocularist can custom fit a prosthetic eye to improve cosmetic appearance. This will typically occur 6-8 weeks post-op. With proper care, prosthetic eyes can last decades.

Possible Complications

As with any surgery, evisceration may be complicated by bleeding, swelling, infection, and scarring. Although these complications are rare, a doctor should be consulted regarding any pre-existing conditions or current medications that may increase the chance of surgical complications. There are also risks with general anesthesia, especially in patients with certain pre-existing health conditions. In addition, patients may experience eyelid droopiness and complications related to the ocular implant. Eyelid droopiness may require additional surgery for correction.

<doc id="502538" wikidata="Q416528" url="?curid=502538" title="Stresemann's bushcrow">
<text>Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni), also known as the Abyssinian pie, bush crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, or by its generic name Zavattariornis, is a rather starling-like bird, which is a member of the crow family, Corvidae. It is slightly larger than the North American blue jay and is a bluish-grey in overall colour which becomes almost white on the forehead. The throat and chest are creamy-white with the tail and wings a glossy black. The black feathers have a tendency to bleach to brown at their tips. The iris of the bird is brown and the eye is surrounded by a band of naked bright blue skin. The bill, legs, and feet are black.

Feeding is usually in small groups and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds building their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that more than just the breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.

The range of this species is quite restricted, it being confined to thorn acacia country in southern Ethiopia near Yavello (Javello), Mega, and Arero. It can be curiously absent from apparently suitable country near these areas; the reasons for this were formerly unclear, but are now thought to be related to the species requiring a &quot;bubble&quot; of lower temperature for proper foraging, which is only present within its small range, making it one of the few warm-blooded animals whose survival is wholly dependent on temperature (along with the sympatric white-tailed swallow). This requirement makes it extremely vulnerable to climate change, and massive declines and even potential extinction in the wild are projected in the future, making it one of the birds most threatened by climate change.

==Taxonomy==
Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow was formally described in 1938 by the Italian ornithologist Edgardo Moltoni. The species has been placed in several bird families since its description. It has long been considered a member of the crow family Corvidae; however, several atypical features, such as its lice being from the suborder Mallophaga, its bare facial skin being capable of movement, and the structure of its palate, have suggested that it may belong in another family. Some authors placed the species within the starling family Sturnidae due to the bushcrow&#x27;s similarities in behavior and size with the wattled starling. Other authors have placed it in its own monotypic family, Zavattariornithidae. DNA-sequencing analysis supports its placement in the corvids, with its closest relatives being the ground jays, and the piapiac. It has been suggested that the bushcrow is a surviving relict ancestor to several of these relatives.

This species has numerous common names, including Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow, bush-crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, Abyssinian bushcrow, and Zavattariornis.

The genus name &quot;Zavattariornis&quot; commemorates Edoardo Zavattari, an Italian zoologist and explorer who served as the director of Rome University&#x27;s Zoological Institute between 1935 and 1958. Its name commemorates Erwin Stresemann, a German ornithologist.

==Description==
Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow is about long and weighs . The sexes look similar and are not sexually dimorphic. Overall it is pale grey with a black tail and wings. The head, mantle, scapulars, back, rump, and uppertail coverts are all a pale grey. The feathers on the forehead, upper ear-coverts, and throat fade into white. The bright azure skin around the bushcrow&#x27;s eye is featherless and can be inflated, narrowing the blackish-brown eye into a slit. The feathers behind the eye are capable of moving to reveal an oblong pink patch of skin. The bird&#x27;s black beak decurves into a sharply pointed tip and is relatively small for a corvid. This beak is long. The feathers on the bird&#x27;s chin are fine and can form a small tuft when erected. The bushcrow&#x27;s breast and flanks are pale grey, fading into white on the rear flanks, belly, and undertail. On the wings, the lesser and median upper-wing coverts are grey, while the rest of the wing is a slightly glossy blue-black. Its blue-black tail is relatively long and square-ended. Its legs are black. When the plumage becomes worn, the upperparts appear to have a brownish tinge. The juvenile Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow is slightly duller than the adult, and the feathers of the body and upperwings are fringed with creamy-fawn. The facial skin, bill, and legs are also a dull grey.

The bushcrow is a very vocal species, particularly when foraging. Its main contact call has been described as a single metallic &quot;kej&quot;. While flying, the species frequently calls out a nasal, rapid &quot;kerr kerr kerr&quot;. While these are the most frequent vocalizations, several others are known. Allopreening adults utter a metallic &quot;kaw, kaw, kaw&quot;. Foraging birds call out &quot;how, how, how&quot;, a single, quiet &quot;quak&quot;, and a soft, repeated &quot;guw&quot;. While building its nest, the bushcrow is known to utter a low &quot;keh&quot; sound, and adults utter a deep &quot;waw&quot; while rubbing their bills together.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is endemic to central-southern Ethiopia. It lives in a small area circumscribed by the towns of Yabelo, Borena, Mega, and Arero in Sidamo Province, and settles in wildlife under protection within Yabelo Wildlife Sanctuary and Borana National Park. Its total range covers about .

Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow lives in flat savanna covered with mature acacia and &quot;Commiphora&quot; thornbushes. The bird prefers open short-grass savannas with scattered stands of these mature thornbushes. The soil must be deep and rich to support the bushcrow. It is most numerous when these stands are next to agricultural fields. For many years it was unknown why the species could be completely absent from areas of suitable habitat near seemingly identical but inhabited land. However recent research has revealed that the bird appears to inhabit an area with a very precise average temperature extreme, all of the seemingly suitable but uninhabited surrounding lands actually have a slightly higher average temperature that appears to prevent the birds from successfully colonizing. It is also not found near the scattered broadleaf woodland made up of &quot;Combretum&quot; and &quot;Terminalia&quot;. Its habitat is between above sea level.

==Ecology and behavior==
Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow is normally found in groups of about six birds. This species does not migrate.

===Diet===
The bushcrow feeds both on the ground and in trees. It begins foraging at sunrise. While foraging, a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A foraging bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while its beak is held slightly open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches something, it carries it to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using its beak to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often mixes with white-crowned starlings, red-billed hornbills, red-billed buffalo weavers, and superb starlings while foraging. When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.

It eats primarily invertebrates and specifically insects, including termites. Larvae and pupae, especially of &quot;Coeloptera&quot; moths, are eaten as well as the adults.

===Reproduction===
Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow nests either alone or in a small, loosely connected colony of three to five nests. It is monogamous and may form a lifelong pair bond. The bushcrow occasionally has a third bird, or in rare cases two to four more, help the breeding couple both build the nest and care for the young. The helpers may also not be restricted to helping one nest at a time, as they have been seen at nests across the loose colonies. Allofeeding and allopreening, where the birds feed or preen each other, takes place both between the pair and with the other bushcrows in the colony. The bushcrow lays its eggs shortly after the first rains, which normally occur in late February and early March, leading to its eggs being laid in late March and early April.

The nest is an untidy globular structure, on which the roof tapers to a point that has an opening into the interior chamber. The nest is in diameter while the interior chamber is across. To start constructing the nest, a single twig is inserted into the top of an acacia tree above the ground. This leads to the paired bushcrows becoming excited, engorging their blue facial skin. Almost ritualistically the pair then pick the acacia&#x27;s leaves and twigs, dropping them to the ground. The pair end this display by chasing each other through the trees before continuing construction. The nest is made out of thorny twigs while the interior chamber is lined with dry grass and dried cattle dung. Damp soil is used to keep the initial twigs connected. Old nests are repaired and reused.

Up to six eggs are laid in the nest. The bushcrow&#x27;s eggs are cream-colored with pale lilac blotches that concentrate into a ring at the wider end.

==Relationship with humans==
Prior to modern settlement in villages, the nomadic indigenous peoples of Ethiopia provided easy hunting grounds for the bushcrow as they left loose, dung-covered soil behind as they moved their cattle. This provided a rich abundance of beetle larvae for the bushcrow to feed upon.

===Conservation===
Changes in the grazing habits of Ethiopia&#x27;s indigenous peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil loose and covered in dung to support the bushcrow&#x27;s prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in overgrazing and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive planting of cash crops such as maize. The rich soil that the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary, acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow&#x27;s nesting site. While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties enforcing the law. It is believed that between 1999 and 2003 the population of the bushcrow declined by 80%.

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow as endangered because of its very restricted range and loss of suitable habitat. The population seems to be declining rapidly and in 2007 it was estimated that there might be fewer than 10,000 birds remaining.
==== Climate change ====
Due to its extremely unusual and specific temperature requirements, the Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow is considered one of the most threatened birds by climate change; climate change is predicted to reduced its range by 90% by 2070 in even the best-case scenarios (occupied range can often overestimate the number of individuals occupying the range, so the estimated population reduction may be even more than 90%), dramatically increasing the risk of extinction, with worse scenarios leading to total extinction in the wild. A similar outcome is predicted for the white-tailed swallow (&quot;Hirundo megaensis&quot;), which shares the same habitat and likely similar requirements, although the estimated range reduction is much lower for the swallow. Both species may be the only examples of warm-blooded animals whose range is fully driven by the climate. Intensive conservation such as captive breeding and assisted migration may be necessary to preserve the Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow. The birds and their projected decline may be used as indicator species for climate change, allowing them to test the reliability of habitat models for other threatened animals. Both may also serve as flagship species for the impacts of climate change on avian diversity in Africa.

<text>Curtis Hooks Brogden (November 6, 1816 – January 5, 1901) was an American farmer, attorney and politician who served as the 42nd governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1874 to 1877 during the Reconstruction era. He succeeded to the position after the death of Governor Tod R. Caldwell, after having been elected as the 2nd lieutenant governor of the state on the Republican ticket in 1872.

Brogden had a long political career, first elected to state office in 1838 at the age of 22. Building a close friendship with editor William Woods Holden of the &quot;North Carolina Standard&quot;, he served nearly without a break in various state offices and lastly as US Congressman, until essentially retiring from politics in 1878. He was elected to one more term in the state legislature in 1886.

==Early life and education==
He was born on November 6, 1816, in the Brogden family home ten miles southwest of Goldsboro, North Carolina, the son of a yeoman farmer. The Brogdens were Quakers of English descent and came to old Dobbs County during the colonial period. Although he attended the local district schools, like most North Carolina farm boys of his generation, his opportunity for higher education was limited, but Brogden was an auto-didact, learning by his own studies.

==Military service==
His father Pierce Brogden was a veteran of the War of 1812, and his grandfather, Thomas Brogden, served in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Brogden continued the family tradition of military service and joined the North Carolina state militia at the age of 18. He was elected captain at his second muster, and eventually rose to the rank of major general. During the Civil War he served the Confederate cause although he never held a field command due to his position in the North Carolina state government that kept him in Raleigh for the duration of the conflict.

==Political career==
First elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1838 as a Jacksonian Democrat, Brogden was its youngest member at age 22. He became known as the &quot;Eloquent Plowboy from Wayne&quot; and served in the House until 1851 where he was the longtime chairman of the House Finance Committee. In 1838, he was also elected as Wayne County Justice of the Peace, a position he held for 20 consecutive years. Brogden studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1845 but never seriously undertook the practice of law.

In 1852, Brogden was elected to the North Carolina Senate, where he served until 1857. That year he was elected by the General Assembly as State Comptroller, a post he held for ten years. He continued in office through the crises of secession, Civil War, and emancipation. During these decades he formed a political alliance with Holden who as the Civil War dragged on became a quiet critic of the Confederate government, a leader of the North Carolina peace movement, and was ultimately appointed governor of North Carolina by President Andrew Johnson in 1865 for a brief term and then elected in 1868.

===Support of Black suffrage===

After the Civil War, Radical Republicans in Congress were not content with President Johnson&#x27;s moderate approach for reconstruction. Concerned that Southern states passed Black Codes restricting freedmen, they passed the Military Reconstruction Acts to temporarily replace state governments and try to remake the societies to incorporate full emancipation of African-American slaves, establish free labor and other rights of citizens for blacks. The Act stipulated that the former Confederate states had to include Negro male suffrage in their new constitutions.

These measures were opposed by most whites in the South, although North Carolina had extended the franchise to free blacks before rescinding it in 1835, following Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion. In North Carolina before the war, blacks made up about one-third of the population of the state, with a majority in the coastal areas and near parity in some Piedmont counties. Wilmington had had the largest proportion and number of free blacks before the war. Due to his Quaker beliefs, Brogden supported extending the franchise.

=== Switch to the Republican Party ===
Brogden followed Holden into the Republican Party after the war. His change of parties and support of negro suffrage shocked his ex-Confederate friends who opposed allowing blacks to vote and because the Republican Party in North Carolina was at the time dominated by carpetbaggers, freedmen and scalawags.

He briefly left the Senate in 1867 after being elected to represent Wayne County at a state constitutional convention. In 1868 he was elected to the State Senate as a Republican, serving for three terms. He also was a member of the Electoral College supporting Republican, Ulysses S. Grant. In 1870 he was appointed as a U.S. Collector of Internal Revenue. He supported Holden as governor and voted in the state legislature against his impeachment.

In 1872, he was elected on the Republican ticket as lieutenant governor with Tod R. Caldwell. When Gov. Caldwell died in office in 1874, Brogden succeeded to the position of governor. By then, white Democrats had regained control of the state legislature, in part by a program of suppression of black voting carried out by the Red Shirts.

=== Governorship ===
During his term as governor, Brogden made a stronger attempt to work with the Democrats who controlled the legislature than his Republican predecessors, and focused on railroad construction and higher education. He worked diligently to re-open the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he had been an appointed trustee from 1869 to 1872. Brogden also called for founding a college for blacks. While making efforts to lower the state debt, he supported construction of a state penitentiary as a public good. During his tenure as governor, the federal government completed the Currituck Beach Lighthouse to light the last remaining dark stretch of coastline along North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks, long known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic in 1875. In 1876, Governor Brogden represented North Carolina at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.

While serving as governor, Brogden was elected in 1876 as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which was a predominately black Republican stronghold in the Piedmont area. In Congress. he worked to gain internal improvements for his state and reduced internal revenue taxes. He also advocated direct presidential elections and pensions for Mexican War veterans. His vote with the Democratic majority for the U.S. Army reorganization bill was unpopular with his Republican constituents.

Brogden served one term and was not re-nominated in 1878, a year of intense rivalry among second district Republicans. Amid charges of fraud, the Democrats narrowly elected their nominee, William H. Kitchin. Two years later, Brogden tried to regain his seat in Congress. After many Republicans disputed the outcome of the turbulent convention, he issued a broadside declaring himself an independent candidate against the convention nominee, Northern immigrant Orlando Hubbs. Brogden called for reduction in the tariff and other taxes and accused Hubbs of not representing the interests of the South. But his efforts collapsed when Republicans closed ranks in response to the entry of a third Democratic candidate into the race. Wayne County was redistricted to the Third Congressional District before Brogden’s next campaign for Congress. In 1884, Brogden was nominated, only to be defeated in the general election by Wharton J. Green, a Democrat.

=== Later political career ===
After losing the congressional election in 1884, Brogden essentially retired from public life with the exception of a single term, in 1887, representing Wayne County in the North Carolina House of Representatives. In a House controlled by Republicans and independents, he spoke in favor of changing the centralized, indirect system of county government the Democrats had instituted ten years before in order to “save” Eastern North Carolina from “Negro rule.” The House passed a bill changing the system, but the Senate rejected it. Brogden was not re-elected in 1888. By then one of the largest landowners in Wayne County, Brogden devoted himself to farming.

Brogden&#x27;s goal of establishing a college for blacks was finally realized more than a decade after he left the governor&#x27;s office. On March 7, 1887, The North Carolina General Assembly founded North Carolina State University as a land-grant college under the name &quot;North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.&quot; In the segregated system, it was open only to white students. Under terms of the Second Morrill Act, in 1890 states were required to have colleges available to all races of students. In order to qualify for the land grants, North Carolina in 1891 established qualifying programs at what became North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, a historically black college, first as part of Shaw Collegiate Institute in Raleigh.

Brogden, a lifelong bachelor, died on January 5, 1901, in his hometown of Goldsboro, North Carolina and is buried there in Willowdale Cemetery.

==Family==

Brogden&#x27;s younger brother Willis H. Brogden (1839-1922) was convicted of murder in 1892 following a dispute over the shooting of one of Willis&#x27;s cows that led to the death of one of his neighbors. Willis claimed he struck the man, who died of his injuries weeks later, in the head with a billy club in self defense after being attacked with a knife. Despite numerous witnesses who attested to Willis&#x27;s excellent character and three of the twelve jurors being potentially compromised in his favor (two were related to the defendant by marriage, and one had previously stated that he believed the accused was innocent) Willis was found guilty of manslaughter. After he was sentenced to six years in the penitentiary, counsel moved to appeal the case and Willis was released from jail on $5000.00 bond (equal to approximately $140,000.00 in 2019) provided by ex-Governor Brogden. Willis received a somewhat controversial pardon from Governor Holt in 1893.

Brogden&#x27;s nephew Willis J. Brogden (1877-1935), son of Willis H., was a prominent attorney who served as mayor of Durham from 1911 to 1915. He became a judge in 1925, when Governor McLean appointed him associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court to fill the unexpired term of Judge L. R. Varser. He was elected to a full term on November 6, 1928, and served on the court until his death in 1935.

Another of Brogden&#x27;s nephews, L. Cramner Brogden, was superintendent of public schools in Kinston in the early 1900s and later served as state supervisor of rural education for North Carolina.

==Legacy and Honors==

Brogden Middle School in Wayne County is named for Governor Brogden.

A North Carolina historical marker marks the site of Brogden&#x27;s home along US 13 southwest of Goldsboro.

<text>Tod Robinson Caldwell (February 19, 1818July 11, 1874) was an American lawyer and the 41st governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1871 until his death in Hillsborough in North Carolina in 1874. 

He was a son of John Caldwell and Hannah Pickett Robinson. He was born in Morganton, North Carolina, where he had a home for most of his life. Caldwell attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating on June 4, 1840. He was a member of the Dialectic Society. He was examined by the Supreme Court and admitted to Superior Court Practice (much like passing a bar examination) in June 1841, becoming solicitor for Burke County. In 1842 he was elected a member of the North Carolina House of Commons in which he served two sessions. In 1850 he represented Burke County in the state senate. After the close of the Civil War he was a member of the Reconstruction Convention, and President of Western North Carolina Railroad.
Caldwell was elected the first lieutenant governor of North Carolina in 1868, the same year the state constitution had created the office. He became governor in 1871 upon the impeachment and conviction of Governor William Woods Holden. Caldwell was elected governor in his own right in 1872, by about two thousand majority, becoming the second Republican elected governor of North Carolina. His areas of interest were the state debt and the state finances and the opening of the public schools which had been closed in 1863 due to lack of money. He appointed Alexander McIver as Superintendent of Public Instruction and got a bill passed allowing private aid for public schools in order to gain funds to reopen the schools.

Caldwell married Minerva Ruffin Cain on December 12, 1840. Tod and Minerva had at least four children: Mary Ruffin Caldwell, wife of Dr. Waighstill Collett; John &quot;Jack&quot; Caldwell, killed at Gettysburg; Martha R. Caldwell, wife of Edward W. Ward; and Hannah J. Caldwell, wife of Walter Brem.

Shortly after arriving on July 9, 1874, at Hillsborough, Orange County, North Carolina to attend the railroad&#x27;s stockholders&#x27; meeting, Caldwell became very ill and died unexpectedly two days later on July 11, 1874. Newspaper reports stated he died from cholera morbus. His body was returned to the state capital to lie in state after which his body was carried to Morganton and buried in the family plot in Forest Hill Cemetery.

<text>William Woods Holden (November 24, 1818 – March 1, 1892) was an American politician who served as the 38th and 40th governor of North Carolina. He was appointed by President Andrew Johnson in 1865 for a brief term and then elected in 1868. He served until 1871 and was the leader of the state&#x27;s Republican Party during the Reconstruction Era.

Holden was the second governor in American history to be impeached, and the first to be removed from office through that process. His impeachment was politically motivated due to his suppression of the Ku Klux Klan. After Republicans lost the 1870 election, Democrats impeached Holden on eight fabricated charges relating to the Kirk–Holden war. He is the only North Carolina governor to have been impeached. In 2011, Holden was posthumously pardoned by the North Carolina Senate in a 48–0 vote.

==Life==
===Early years===
Holden was born on November 24, 1818, and raised near Hillsborough, North Carolina. Aged 10, he began a six-year apprenticeship with Dennis Heartt at the &quot;Hillsborough Recorder&quot; newspaper in Hillsborough, North Carolina. By age 19, Holden was working as a printer and writer at the &quot;Raleigh Star&quot;, in Raleigh, North Carolina. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1841, and became a member of the Whig party. However, he never practiced law and instead participated in the newspaper business.

In 1843, he became owner and editor of the &quot;North Carolina Standard&quot; in Raleigh. He changed the newspaper&#x27;s party affiliation to the Democratic Party. When Holden took over the newspaper, it was struggling financially. Under his leadership, it became one of the most widely read newspapers in the state. He continued as owner and editor of the newspaper until he was elected governor.

===Political career===
In December 1843, Holden became a delegate to the Democratic state party convention, where he was elected to the North Carolina Democratic Party state executive committee. In 1846, Holden was elected to represent Wake County in the North Carolina House of Commons and chose to only serve one term. During the 1850 elections he served a major role in ending the Whig dominance in the state. By 1858, he was chairman of the party. That year, he unsuccessfully attempted to gain the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but was defeated by John W. Ellis, and then his party passed him over for a Senate seat.

Throughout the 1840s and 1850s, Holden advocated for Southern rights to expand slavery and sometimes supported the right of secession, but by 1860 he had shifted his position to support the Union. Holden and his newspaper fell out of favor with the state Democratic Party, and he was removed as the state&#x27;s printer when he editorialized against secession in 1860. In 1861, Holden was sent to a state convention to vote against secession representing Wake County.

As the Civil War progressed, Holden became critical of the Confederate government, and became a leader of the North Carolina peace movement. In 1864, he ran against incumbent Governor Zebulon B. Vance as a peace candidate, but Vance defeated him in a landslide receiving over eighty percent of the vote.

When the Civil War ended on May 9, 1865, Holden was appointed Governor on May 29, by President Andrew Johnson. During Reconstruction he served a major role in North Carolina and placed the &quot;Standard&quot; newspaper in the hands of his son, Joseph W. Holden. However, he was defeated by Jonathan Worth in a special election for governor in 1865.

Johnson then nominated Holden to be minister to El Salvador, but the Senate rejected his nomination, so he returned to editing the &quot;Standard&quot;, and became president of the North Carolina Union League, and organized the North Carolina Republican Party in 1866–67.

===Governor===

While voters were approving the new state constitution, Holden was elected governor at the head of the Republican ticket in 1868, defeating Thomas Samuel Ashe. When he was elected governor, Holden gave up editorship and ownership of the &quot;Standard&quot;.

To combat the Ku Klux Klan, Holden hired two dozen detectives from 1869 to 1870, and although the detective unit was not overly successful in limiting Klan activities, his efforts to suppress the Klan exceeded those of other Southern governors. With new powers granted to him by the state legislature under the 1870 Shoffner Act, he called out the militia against the Klan in 1870, imposed martial law in two counties, and suspended the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for accused leaders of the Klan in what became known as the Kirk–Holden war. The result was a political backlash, accompanied by violence at the time of the election to suppress the black vote. The Republicans lost the legislative election.

After the Democratic Party regained majorities in both houses of the state legislature in 1870, Governor Holden was impeached by the North Carolina House of Representatives on December 14, 1870. During his trial in the Senate he was defended by Nathaniel Boyden and William N. H. Smith, but he was convicted on six of the eight charges against him by Democratic members of the North Carolina Senate in party-line votes on March 22, 1871. Holden&#x27;s son-in-law, state senator Lewis P. Olds, was among those who voted against removal. The other two charges received majority votes, but not the required two-thirds majorities.

The main charges against Holden were related to the rough treatment and arrests of North Carolina citizens by state militia officer Colonel George W. Kirk during the enforcement of Reconstruction civil rights legislation. Holden had formed the state militia to respond to the assassination of Republican senator John W. Stephens on May 21, 1870, and the lynching of Wyatt Outlaw, a black police officer in the town of Graham in Alamance County, as well as numerous attacks by the Ku Klux Klan.

Holden was the first governor in American history to be impeached, convicted, and removed from office. Governor Charles L. Robinson of Kansas was the first American governor to be impeached, however, without conviction and removal.

===Later life===
Following his impeachment and removal from office he moved to Washington, D.C., where he resumed working on the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;. In 1873, President Ulysses Grant appointed him as postmaster for Raleigh and he served until 1881. President James A. Garfield was later asked by Raleigh Republicans to not re-appoint him and Holden left the Republican party after losing his position.

Holden died on March 1, 1892, and was buried at Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh. He was recognized as &quot;one of the foremost men in intellectual power and daring that were ever born here&quot; by North Carolinian Walter Hines Page. In 2011, Holden was posthumously pardoned by the North Carolina Senate in a 48–0 vote.

<text>In electronics, a common-emitter amplifier is one of three basic single-stage bipolar-junction-transistor (BJT) amplifier topologies, typically used as a voltage amplifier. It offers high current gain (typically 200), medium input resistance and a high output resistance. The output of a common emitter amplifier is inverted; i.e. for a sine wave input signal, the output signal is 180 degrees out of phase with respect to the input.

In this circuit, the base terminal of the transistor serves as the input, the collector is the output, and the emitter is &quot;common&quot; to both (for example, it may be tied to ground reference or a power supply rail), hence its name. The analogous FET circuit is the common-source amplifier, and the analogous tube circuit is the common-cathode amplifier.

== Emitter degeneration ==
Common-emitter amplifiers give the amplifier an inverted output and can have a very high gain that may vary widely from one transistor to the next. The gain is a strong function of both temperature and bias current, and so the actual gain is somewhat unpredictable. Stability is another problem associated with such high-gain circuits due to any unintentional positive feedback that may be present.

Other problems associated with the circuit are the low input dynamic range imposed by the small-signal limit; there is high distortion if this limit is exceeded and the transistor ceases to behave like its small-signal model. One common way of alleviating these issues is with &quot;emitter degeneration&quot;. This refers to the addition of a small resistor between the emitter and the common signal source (e.g., the ground reference or a power supply rail). This impedance formula_1 reduces the overall transconductance formula_2 of the circuit by a factor of formula_3, which makes the voltage gain

:formula_4

where formula_5.

The voltage gain depends almost exclusively on the ratio of the resistors formula_6 rather than the transistor&#x27;s intrinsic and unpredictable characteristics. The distortion and stability characteristics of the circuit are thus improved at the expense of a reduction in gain.

(While this is often described as &quot;negative feedback&quot;, as it reduces gain, raises input impedance, and reduces distortion, it predates the invention of the negative feedback amplifier and does not reduce output impedance or increase bandwidth, as a true negative feedback amplifier would do.)

== Characteristics ==
At low frequencies and using a simplified hybrid-pi model, the following small-signal characteristics can be derived.

If the emitter degeneration resistor is not present, then formula_7, and the expressions effectively simplify to the ones given by the rightmost column (note that the voltage gain is an ideal value; the actual gain is somewhat unpredictable). As expected, when &quot;formula_8&quot; is increased, the input impedance is increased and the voltage gain formula_9 is reduced.

===Bandwidth===
The bandwidth of the common-emitter amplifier tends to be low due to high capacitance resulting from the Miller effect. The parasitic base-collector capacitance formula_10 appears like a larger parasitic capacitor formula_11 (where formula_9 is negative) from the base to ground. This large capacitor greatly decreases the bandwidth of the amplifier as it makes the time constant of the parasitic input RC filter formula_13 where formula_14 is the output impedance of the signal source connected to the ideal base.

The problem can be mitigated in several ways, including:
* Reduction of the voltage gain magnitude formula_15 (e.g., by using emitter degeneration).
* Reduction of the output impedance formula_14 of the signal source connected to the base (e.g., by using an emitter follower or some other voltage follower).
* Using a cascode configuration, which inserts a low input impedance current buffer (e.g. a common base amplifier) between the transistor&#x27;s collector and the load. This configuration holds the transistor&#x27;s collector voltage roughly constant, thus making the base to collector gain zero and hence (ideally) removing the Miller effect.
* Using a differential amplifier topology like an emitter follower driving a grounded-base amplifier; as long as the emitter follower is truly a common-collector amplifier, the Miller effect is removed.

The Miller effect negatively affects the performance of the common source amplifier in the same way (and has similar solutions). When an AC signal is applied to the transistor amplifier it causes the base voltage VB to fluctuate in value at the AC signal. The positive half of the applied signal will cause an increase in the value of VB this turn will increase the base current IB and cause a corresponding increase in emitter current IE and collector current IC. As a result, the collector emitter voltage will be reduced because of the increase voltage drop across RL. The negative alternation of an AC signal will cause a decrease in IB this action then causes a corresponding decrease in IE through RL.

It is also named common-emitter amplifier because the emitter of the transistor is common to both the input circuit and output circuit. The input signal is applied across the ground and the base circuit of the transistor. The output signal appears across ground and the collector of the transistor. Since the emitter is connected to the ground, it is common to signals, input and output.

The common-emitter circuit is the most widely used of junction transistor amplifiers. As compared with the common-base connection, it has higher input impedance and lower output impedance. A single power supply is easily used for biasing. In addition, higher voltage and power gains are usually obtained for common-emitter (CE) operation.

Current gain in the common emitter circuit is obtained from the base and the collector circuit currents. Because a very small change in base current produces a large change in collector current, the current gain (β) is always greater than unity for the common-emitter circuit, a typical value is about 50.

== Applications ==
=== Low-frequency voltage amplifier ===
A typical example of the use of a common-emitter amplifier is shown in Figure 3.

The input capacitor C removes any DC component of the input, and the resistors R1 and R2 bias the transistor so that it will remain in active mode for the entire range of the input. The output is an inverted copy of the AC component of the input that has been amplified by the ratio &quot;R&quot;C/&quot;R&quot;E and shifted by an amount determined by all four resistors. Because &quot;R&quot;C is often large, the output impedance of this circuit can be prohibitively high. To alleviate this problem, &quot;R&quot;C is kept as low as possible and the amplifier is followed by a voltage buffer like an emitter follower.

=== Radio ===
Common-emitter amplifiers are also used in radio frequency circuits, for example to amplify faint signals received by an antenna. In this case it is common to replace the load resistor with a tuned circuit. This may be done to limit the bandwidth to a narrow band centered around the intended operating frequency. More importantly it also allows the circuit to operate at higher frequencies as the tuned circuit can be used to resonate any inter-electrode and stray capacitances, which normally limit the frequency response. Common emitters are also commonly used as low-noise amplifiers.

=== Audio ===

Common-emitter amplifiers are also used for audio amplifiers. For example, a do it yourself or hobbyist application of the common-emitter amplifier is presented in.

<doc id="502557" wikidata="Q884994" url="?curid=502557" title="Jonathan Worth (governor)">
<text>Jonathan Worth (November 18, 1802 – September 5, 1869) was the 39th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1865 to 1868, during the early years of Reconstruction.

==Early life==
Jonathan Worth was born on November 18, 1802, in Randolph County, North Carolina to Dr. David Worth and Eunice Worth (née Gardner). A native of Guilford County, Worth settled in Randolph County and made his fame and fortune there as an attorney and legislator. A Quaker and protégé of Judge Archibald Murphey, Worth championed the cause of free public schools for white students (a position he abandoned during Reconstruction to avoid providing public education to black students), and, though he belonged to the greatly outnumbered Whig party, gained much stature for his practicality and vision.

In 1830, he ran for a seat in the North Carolina House of Representatives from Randolph County, motivated in large part by a failing law practice. His major shortcoming, he had decided, was his deficiency as a public speaker. His peers at the Bar persuaded him there was no better way to improve his oratory and achieve better rhetoric than to become a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, which thrives on &quot;talk&quot;.

He served two terms in the House, took a break from public service to build a lucrative law practice, was elected to the North Carolina Senate, and then ran twice for Congress, both times unsuccessfully.

In 1858, Worth was again elected to the State Senate, where he was made chairman of a committee to investigate the poorly run North Carolina Railroad. He pursued this official duty so relentlessly that the president of the Railroad, formerly a good friend, challenged Worth to a duel, which Worth declined.

==Civil War Treasurer==
Worth was an avid opponent of North Carolina&#x27;s secession from the Union. Though opposed to the Confederate stands on most issues, Worth remained loyal to North Carolina and refused to take part in several peace movements. He owned slaves and saw slavery as a Constitutional right which was best defended by remaining within the Union. In late 1862 or early 1863, the legislature elected him State Treasurer by acclamation.

Worth had the duty of issuing notes and bonds to finance the State&#x27;s share of its war debt. Of the some $20 million in notes authorized by the State, Worth issued $8.5 million and $5.2 million were outstanding at the end of the war. War bonds totaling more than $13 million were issued. At the end of the war, all of the State&#x27;s war debt was repudiated.

Just before Raleigh was occupied by Sherman&#x27;s conquering forces at the end of the war, Governor Zebulon B. Vance charged Worth with the duty of safeguarding the State archives, which he did by evacuating them to Company Shops in Alamance County. Worth was so highly regarded that when William W. Holden was installed as the provisional governor, he requested Worth continue as the provisional treasurer. Worth held that title for five months until he resigned during his campaign against Gov. Holden in a special November 9, 1865, election. Worth is the only statewide North Carolina treasurer to become governor.

==Governor==
Worth was nominated by the Conservative Party, a state coalition that included most Democrats and some former Whigs, to run for governor in North Carolina&#x27;s first and only special election for the office. Worth had been associated with the Conservative Party since the beginning of the Civil War. His opponent was the incumbent Gov. William W. Holden, who had been appointed by President Andrew Johnson and was running on the National Union Party ticket. Worth&#x27;s strength was in the eastern part of the state, and Holden carried the western counties which had mostly opposed secession and the Civil War. Worth won with 32,549 votes (55.5%) to Holden&#x27;s 25,809 votes (44.0%). Worth won with the support of many elements of the state that had supported secession. The 1865 election had been conducted according to the 1865 state constitution, which was rejected by the U.S. Congress.

Worth was re-elected on October 18, 1866, for a term that started December 22, 1866. He won 34,250 votes (75.9%) to 10,759 votes (23.8%) for former U.S. Rep. Alfred Dockery, running on the National Union Party ticket. In both his gubernatorial campaigns, Worth emphasized that he had opposed secession and that he sought to heal state and national divisions. He expressed support for President Andrew Johnson.

The major event of Worth&#x27;s second term was the state constitutional convention, held in early 1868 to draft a constitution meeting the requirements of Congress. One of Worth&#x27;s major interests was to restore North Carolina to the Union. Worth was disappointed with the new constitution and refused to run for re-election on the Conservative Party ticket in the election of 1868. He did not recognize the legitimacy of that election, which William W. Holden won. Nevertheless, he wrote to Holden: &quot;I surrender the office to you under what I deem Military duress.&quot;

Worth died 14 months after leaving office as governor. He is buried in Historic Oakwood Cemetery.

His younger brother, John M. Worth, was also a successful politician and North Carolina State Treasurer from 1876 to 1885.

==Personal life==
On October 20, 1824, Jonathan Worth married Martitia Daniel, a niece of Judge Archibald Murphey. They had eight children: Roxana Cornelia (born 1826), Lucy Jane (born 1828), David Gaston (born 1831), Eunice Louisa (born 1832), Elvira Evelyna (born 1838), Sarah Corinne (born 1839), Adelaide Ann (born 1842) and Mary Martitia (born 1846). Famous descendants include grandsons Worth Bagley and David W. Bagley, granddaughter Addie Worth Bagley Daniels, and her son, Jonathan Worth Daniels.

<text>Henry Toole Clark (February 7, 1808 April 14, 1874) was the 36th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1861 to 1862 during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Henry T. Clark was born to a prominent Edgecombe County, North Carolina, planter family. His father, James West Clark, served as a US Congressman and later as a Navy Department official in the Andrew Jackson administration. The Clarks were members of that elite planter class that dominated social and political thought in eastern North Carolina. Henry Clark devoted over twenty years to the service of the Democratic Party at the local, state, and national levels, and over ten years as a state senator.

Clark attended The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was a member of the Dialectic Society. He graduated with honors in 1826 and later earned an A. M. in 1832. He joined the bar a year later, though he rarely practiced. He spent most of his time managing the family&#x27;s extensive land and slave holdings in North Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. The Clarks owned as many as sixty-two slaves, many of whom were hired out to others for their labor.

==Political career==
In 1861, Clark was Speaker of the North Carolina Senate. When state governor John W. Ellis died in office, Clark succeeded him (as was the law at the time). He served as the state&#x27;s chief executive from July 1861 to September 1862, a crucial period in which North Carolina established itself as a constituent member of the Confederate States and first suffered the hardships of war. As the leader of the state in that formative period, he mobilized thousands of soldiers for the Southern cause, established the only Confederate prison in North Carolina, arranged the production of salt for the war effort, created European purchasing connections, and built a successful and important gunpowder mill. The conservative Clark, however, found more success as an administrator than as a political figure. As governor, he was unable to maneuver in the new political world ushered in by the Civil War, and he retired abruptly from public service at the end of his term in September 1862.

In his later years, he served the local Democratic party and returned for one term as a state senator in 1866. Clark died at his home near Tarboro, North Carolina.

<text>John Willis Ellis (November 23, 1820 – July 7, 1861) was the 35th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1859 to 1861. He was born in Rowan County, North Carolina.

Ellis attended the University of North Carolina, studied law under Richmond Mumford Pearson, practiced law, and was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly from Rowan County. He served as a state superior court judge from 1848 to 1858. He was elected Governor in 1858 by a large majority over Duncan K. McRae, a Democrat supported by remnants of the Whig Party. Ellis was easily re-elected in 1860 over John Pool.

As the American Civil War was beginning, President Abraham Lincoln requested troops from North Carolina to quell the rebellion. Ellis replied, &quot;I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of the country and to this war upon the liberties of a free people. You can get no troops from North Carolina.&quot; During the start of the U.S. Civil War Governor John Willis Ellis ordered cadets from the North Carolina Military Academy to Raleigh, North Carolina to serve as drill masters.

Shortly after North Carolina seceded from the Union, Ellis died in office. The Speaker of the North Carolina Senate, Henry T. Clark, completed his term. He is buried at the Old English Cemetery in Salisbury, North Carolina.

<text>Thomas Bragg (November 9, 1810January 21, 1872) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 34th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1855 through 1859. During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate States Cabinet. He was the older brother of General Braxton Bragg. They were direct descendants of Thomas Bragg (1579–1665) who was born in England and settled in the Virginia Colony.

Born in Warrenton, North Carolina, to a middle-class, slaveowning family, Bragg attended Warrenton Academy and later graduated from Captain Partridge’s American Literary, Scientific &amp; Military Academy (now known as Norwich University – The Military College of Vermont). He was admitted to the bar in 1833 and commenced practice in Jackson, North Carolina. He was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly from 1842 to 1843 and became the prosecuting attorney for Northampton County. He successfully ran for governor of North Carolina and served from 1855 to 1859. He then took a seat in the United States Senate, serving from 1859 until the start of the Civil War in 1861. He served as chairman of the Committee on Claims in the thirty-sixth congress. He resigned and was expelled for siding with the Confederacy. Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed Bragg Attorney General of the Confederate States; he served from 1861 until his resignation in 1862. In 1870, Bragg served as special counsel in the impeachment proceedings of Governor William Woods Holden, related to the latter&#x27;s efforts to curb the influence of the Ku Klux Klan in Reconstruction-era North Carolina. He continued to practice law until his death in 1872, and was also chairman of the central executive committee of the North Carolina Democratic Party (then called the Democratic-Conservative Party) as of 1870. He was interred in Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.

His home at Jackson, the Amis-Bragg House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

<text>Warren Winslow (January 1, 1810 – August 16, 1862) was an American politician, who served as 33rd Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1854 to 1855. Although first elected to the state senate in 1854, Winslow had a spectacular rise to Democratic Party leadership and became Speaker of the senate that year.

Winslow was serving as Speaker of the North Carolina Senate in 1854 when Governor David S. Reid resigned, having been elected to the Senate by the legislature. According to the amendments passed at the Convention of 1835, if a governor died or left office, the Speaker of the Senate was to assume the post (the lieutenant governor position was not created until the ratification of the Constitution of 1868). Winslow graduated from the University of North Carolina. After being elected to a vacant U.S. Senate seat and with almost one month left in his gubernatorial term, Governor David S. Reid handed the gubernatorial position to Winslow on December 6, 1854. Winslow served in this position until Thomas Bragg was inaugurated on January 1, 1855. He then served in the United States House of Representatives from March 1855 to March 1861.

Winslow was a slave owner.

Winslow was a native of Fayetteville, North Carolina, which is also where he died.

<text>David Settle Reid (April 19, 1813 – June 19, 1891) was the 32nd governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1851 to 1854 and a U.S. Senator from December 1854 to March 1859. His uncle and eventual father-in-law was Congressman Thomas Settle.

He was born in what would later be Reidsville, North Carolina, an unincorporated town named for his father, Reuben Reid. He had a brother, Hugh Kearns Reid. At age 16, David Reid became the first postmaster for the town. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1833. From 1835 to 1842, Reid served in the North Carolina Senate. He was a U.S. Representative from 1843 to 1847. Reid ran for governor in 1848 as a long-shot candidate. In his campaign, Reid promoted the now-obscure cause of &quot;free suffrage,&quot; i.e. that there should not be different standards for who could vote for members of the North Carolina House of Commons and of the North Carolina Senate. It was assumed that more voters would only increase the Whig domination of the state, but the Whigs denounced suffrage reform as &quot;a system of communism unjust and Jacobinical.&quot; To everyone&#x27;s surprise, Reid lost to Charles Manly by only 854 votes. In 1850, Reid defeated Manly by 2,853 votes, becoming the first elected Democratic governor of North Carolina. He was reelected Governor in 1852.

In the United States Senate, Reid was chairman of the Committee on Patents and the Patent Office. He sought but was denied a full term in the Senate when he lost a three-way internal party fight with Thomas Bragg and William W. Holden in 1858. He returned to the practice of law and was a delegate to the ill-fated 1861 Washington Peace Conference to try to prevent the American Civil War. Reid was a member of a state constitutional convention in 1875. In the early 1870s Reid moved from his farm on the Dan River to the nearby seat of Rockingham County Wentworth where he continued to practice law and was respected as an elder statesman of the Democratic Party.

In May 1881 Reid suffered a serious stroke at Wentworth and was soon moved to his elder son&#x27;s Reidsville home where he died in June 1891 and was buried in nearby Greenview Cemetery. His widow and first cousin, Henrietta Settle Reid, died in 1913 and was buried by her husband. None of the few remaining descendants of David Settle Reid live today in his native Rockingham County.

<doc id="502570" wikidata="Q730936" url="?curid=502570" title="William Alexander Graham">
<text>William Alexander Graham (September 5, 1804August 11, 1875) was a United States senator from North Carolina from 1840 to 1843, a senator later in the Confederate States Senate from 1864 to 1865, the 30th governor of North Carolina from 1845 to 1849 and U.S. secretary of the Navy from 1850 to 1852, under President Millard Fillmore. He was the Whig Party nominee for vice-president in 1852 on a ticket with General Winfield Scott.

==Early life and education==
Graham was born at Vesuvius Furnace near Lincolnton, North Carolina, the son of Joseph and Isabella (Davidson) Graham. His Scots-Irish grandfather James Graham (1714–1763) was born in Drumbo, County Down, Northern Ireland and settled in Chester County in the Province of Pennsylvania.

Graham attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he studied law and was an active member of the Dialectic Society. He graduated in 1824, was admitted to the bar in 1825, and began practicing law in Hillsborough.

==Political career==
From 1833 to 1840, Graham was a member of the North Carolina House of Commons from Orange County. He served twice as speaker of that house.

In 1840, Graham was elected to the United States Senate as a Whig to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Robert Strange. He served in the Senate from November 25, 1840, to March 3, 1843. In the Twenty-seventh Congress, he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Claims. His older brother, James Graham, had been representing North Carolina in the House since 1833.

From 1845 to 1849, Graham was Governor of North Carolina. Having declined appointments as ambassador to Spain and Russia in 1849, he was appointed Secretary of the Navy in the cabinet of President Millard Fillmore in 1850 and served until 1852. In the 1852 presidential election, he was the unsuccessful Whig nominee for vice president as Winfield Scott&#x27;s running mate. The ticket only carried 42 electoral votes from the four states of Kentucky, Massachusetts, Tennessee, and Vermont.

Graham was a member of the North Carolina Senate from 1854 to 1866. In December 1860, James Alexander Hamilton of New York made an abortive appeal to the Pennsylvania presidential electors that they vote for Graham for president as a possible means of preserving the Republic.

Although Graham was a Unionist who opposed early secessionist efforts, he eventually voted for secession after Fort Sumter. Graham was a senator in the Confederate Senate from 1864 to 1865. In April 1865, with the Confederacy near defeat, Graham personally led a delegation that included another former governor, David Swain, to ask Union General William T. Sherman for a truce so that the state&#x27;s capital, Raleigh, might be spared violence and destruction. Sherman agreed.

==Later life==
In 1866 Graham was once again elected to the United States Senate, but because North Carolina had not yet been readmitted to the Union, he could not present his credentials. From 1867 to 1875, he was a member of the board of trustees of the Peabody Fund, which provided educational assistance to the post-Civil War South. From 1873 to 1875, he was an arbitrator in the boundary line dispute between Virginia and Maryland. He died in Saratoga Springs, New York and is buried in the Old Town Cemetery in Hillsborough, adjacent to the Presbyterian Church.

==Legacy==
The United States Navy ship, &quot;USS Graham (DD-192)&quot;, the World War II Liberty ship &quot;SS William A. Graham&quot;, and the city of Graham, North Carolina were all named for him, as was Graham County, North Carolina.

Montrose Gardens, located in Hillsborough, North Carolina, is one of Graham&#x27;s former estates and still features some of the structures Graham and his family had built on the property. He lived in the Nash-Hooper House at Hillsborough from 1869 until 1875. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971.

One of Graham&#x27;s sons, also named William A. Graham, became a state legislator and state agriculture commissioner. Two others, Augustus and John, also became politicians, while a daughter, Susan, married Walter Clark.

In 1842, John H. Hewitt dedicated a song, The Old Family Clock, to Susannah Sarah Washington Graham.

<doc id="502571" wikidata="Q818853" url="?curid=502571" title="Bercy station (Paris Métro)">
<text>Bercy station () is a below-ground station on lines 6 and 14 of the Paris Métro. It is located at the intersection of the Boulevard de Bercy and the Rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement. West of the station, Line 6 goes above ground and crosses the Seine to the Rive Gauche on the Pont de Bercy.

==History==
The station opened on 1 March 1909 when Line 6 was opened from Nation to Place d&#x27;Italie. (Line 6 was extended from Place d’Italie to Etoile in 1942.). The Line 14 platforms opened on 15 October 1998 as part of the original section of the line from Madeleine to Bibliothèque François Mitterrand.

The station is named after the Rue de Bercy and the Boulevard de Bercy whose intersection lies above it. The intersection is on the site of the &quot;Barrière de Bercy&quot;, one of the gates in the Wall of the Farmers-General (1784-1860), where taxes were collected on goods brought into the city. The Rue and the Boulevard were named after the commune of Bercy, which upon its creation in 1790 stretched along the Seine from the present-day Boulevard de Bercy to Charenton-le-Pont, much of it controlled during the Middle Ages by the lords of Bercy. When Paris annexed its near suburbs in 1860, the commune was partitioned and Bercy became a district in the new 12th arrondissement bounded by what is now the Boulevard de Bercy, Boulevard de Charenton, Boulevard Péripherique, and the Seine.

From 1972 to 1974, during the pneumatisation of Line 6, the Gare de Paris Bercy, located south of the station, was used to carry out this work.

On 16 July 2018, several name signs of the station are temporarily replaced to celebrate the victory of the France national football team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, as in five other stations. Bercy was humorously renamed &quot;Bercy les Bleus&quot; (for &quot;Merci les Bleus&quot;) as a thank you to the players of the French team.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has several exits:
* Access 1, &quot;Bercy Arena&quot;: two stairs and an elevator Place du Bataillon-du-Pacifique;
* Access 2, &quot;Rue Corbineau&quot;: a staircase at 48, Boulevard de Bercy;
* Access 3, &quot;Gare de Bercy&quot;: a fixed staircase on the Rue de Bercy, odd side and two fixed stairs each lined with an escalator on the even side.

=== Station layout ===
===Platforms===

The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. Two per stopping point, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the centre. A connection connects the two tunnels, between the track direction Mairie de Saint-Ouen of Line 14 and the track direction Étoile of Line 6.

Line 6 station has an elliptical vault. The decoration is of the style used for most Métro stations, bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, vault and tunnel exits, while lighting is provided by two tube-canopies. The advertising frames are metallic; the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plaques. The platforms are equipped with wooden slatted benches.

The architecture of the station of Line 14 follows the principles defined by Bernard Kohn for the whole of Line 14 since 1991, both in the choice of materials (light concrete ceilings, wood on the walls, floor tiles) and for lighting and ceiling height. The platforms are also wider than those of the other lines. The name of the station is written in Parisine font on backlit panels embedded in the walls and on stickers affixed to the platform facades.

==Nearby==
* The office complex of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance (&quot;Ministère de l&#x27;Économie et des Finances&quot;), each nicknamed simply &quot;Bercy&quot;, is located to the west of the station.
* Accor Arena (formerly Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy or POPB), a major sports and music arena, is located to the south of the station.
* The Parc de Bercy extends southeast of the Arena on 14 ha (35 ac) between the Rue de Bercy and the Seine. The Arena was built in the 1980s and the Parc in the 1990s on the site of the Entrepôts de Bercy, a complex of wine warehouses that grew up outside the tax wall in the early 19th century.
* The Cinémathèque Française, formerly the American Center, designed by Frank Gehry, is 400 meters east on the Rue de Bercy.
* East of the station, on the Boulevard de Bercy, is the Gare de Paris-Bercy-Bourgogne-Pays d&#x27;Auvergne (formerly the Gare de Bercy), serving medium-distance domestic rail services to Avallon via , Sens and Auxerre. Between the two is the Gare de Bercy bus terminal.

<doc id="502573" wikidata="Q64176" url="?curid=502573" title="Kurt Biedenkopf">
<text>Kurt Hans Biedenkopf (; 28 January 1930 – 12 August 2021) was a German jurist, academic teacher and politician of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) party. He was rector of the Ruhr University Bochum.

Biedenkopf made a political career first in North Rhine-Westphalia, where he was chairman of the party. After the re-unification of Germany, he served as the first Minister President of the Free State of Saxony from 1990 until 2002. He was 54th president of the Bundesrat from 2000, overseeing the body&#x27;s move from Bonn to Berlin. Biedenkopf is regarded as the intellectual leader of the CDU when Helmut Kohl was chancellor.

Biedenkopf worked on advisory boards of institutions including the Bertelsmann Stiftung, Deutsche Nationalstiftung, Dresden Frauenkirche, Independent Commission on Turkey and the Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Meissen. Among his numerous recognitions were international honorific doctorates.

==Early life and science ==
Biedenkopf was born in Ludwigshafen am Rhein. When his father became technical director of the Buna-Werke, the family moved to Schkopau, where he attended school. Biedenkopf first studied political sciences from 1949 to 1950 at Davidson College in North Carolina and at Georgetown University. He then studied economics and law in Germany at the University of Munich, achieving a law doctorate in 1958. He obtained a Master in Law in 1962 from Georgetown University, where he studied and researched again from 1958 to 1959 and 1961 to 1962. In 1963 Biedenkopf completed his habilitation at Goethe University Frankfurt. He became lecturer of the Ruhr University Bochum in 1964. In 1967, he was appointed rector of the university; he was the youngest head of a university in West Germany at the time. He was lecturer and visiting professor also at the Goethe University Frankfurt and Leipzig University. In the early 1970s, Biedenkopf moved to the board of Henkel.

==Political career==

===Career in national politics===
Biedenkopf was a member of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU). He entered his professional political career when he became secretary general of the CDU in 1973, under the leadership of chairman Helmut Kohl. He resigned from that office in 1977 after disagreements with Kohl and went on to become one of his fiercest rivals within the party.

From 1977 to 1983 he was deputy chairman of the CDU in Germany. During the terms 1976–1980 and 1987–1990 he was a member of the Bundestag.

In 1979, it was revealed that Christel Broszey, Biedenkopf&#x27;s secretary, disappeared and was presumed to have fled to East Germany. Media reported that Broszey had been a spy.

===Career in North Rhine-Westphalia===
In the 1980, state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Biedenkopf unsuccessfully ran against the incumbent Minister-President Johannes Rau. He served as chairman of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia – the party&#x27;s largest chapter – until 1987, when he was succeeded by Norbert Blüm. In late 1989, he joined forces with Lothar Späth, Heiner Geißler, Rita Süssmuth and others in an unsuccessful effort to oust Kohl as CDU chairman.

===Minister-President of Saxony===
After the re-unification of Germany in 1990 Biedenkopf was elected as Minister-President in the newly formed state of Saxony. His party also won the subsequent elections in 1994 and 1999 with an absolute majority. He held his office until April 2002.

At the CDU&#x27;s initiative, the state parliament resolved to declare Saxony a &quot;free state&quot; once again, recalling its 19th century history. Early in his tenure, Biedenkopf emerged as a kind of unofficial spokesman for the regions of East Germany. He enjoyed great popularity among a majority of the people of Saxony. Known for his autocratic leadership style, he was often referred to as &quot;the Saxon King&quot; or &quot;King Kurt&quot;. During his time in office, he doubled outlays on primary and secondary education and sharply ramped up spending on research and development. He also led a legal battle against the European Commission on subsidies for Volkswagen investments in Saxony.

Ahead of the German presidential election in 1994, Biedenkopf was widely seen as a likely candidate, but the post went to Roman Herzog.

In 2000, Biedenkopf held the rotating presidency of the Bundesrat of Germany. In this capacity, he oversaw the body&#x27;s move to Berlin to complete the government&#x27;s return to the pre-World War II capital from Bonn.

In January 2001, Biedenkopf dismissed State Minister of Finance Georg Milbradt because Milbradt had started a debate about Biedenkopf&#x27;s succession. Milbradt eventually succeeded Biedenkopf in 2002.

==Death==

Biedenkopf died in Dresden on 12 August 2021 at the age of 91.

==Political positions==

Before the introduction of the euro, Biedenkopf was the only German state leader to vote against the monetary union in the Bundesrat, the legislative body that represents the German states; he later argued that &quot;Europe wasn&#x27;t ready for that epochal step.&quot; Already in 1997, he had joined the minister-presidents of two other German states, Gerhard Schröder and Edmund Stoiber, in making the case for a five-year delay in Europe&#x27;s currency union.

Ahead of the Christian Democrats&#x27; leadership election in 2018, Biedenkopf publicly endorsed Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to succeed Angela Merkel as the party&#x27;s chair. He later supported Armin Laschet&#x27;s candidacy to succeed Kramp-Karrenbauer in the 2021 leadership election.

==Other activities==
In 1983, Biedenkopf became a member of the advisory board of the non-profit Bertelsmann Stiftung. In 1987, he became chairman of the board (until 1990). During his term, the Carl Bertelsmann Prize (today Reinhard Mohn Prize) was awarded for the first time. He was active on the board of the , active for the unification of Germany after the separation and within the European community, and was the foundation&#x27;s honorary senator until his death.

Between 2004 and 2006, Biedenkopf and Christine Bergmann served as ombuds, observing the impact of the Schröder government&#x27;s labour market reforms, with a mandate to advise government and parliament on any recommended revisions to it. In 2005, he was appointed by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to head a commission on the future of codetermination in Germany. Both Biedenkopf and Schröder later served as mediators in a 2006 conflict over privatisation plans at German railway operator Deutsche Bahn; the plans eventually fell through.

In addition, Biedenkopf held a number of paid and unpaid positions, including: 
* Dresden Frauenkirche, member of the board of trustees
* International Law Institute (ILI), member of the international advisory board
* Independent Commission on Turkey, member
* Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft, member of the board of trustees
* Hertie School of Governance, chairman of the board of trustees (2003–2010)
* Lions Club Germany Foundation, member
* Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Meissen, chairman of the supervisory board (1991–2015)

<doc id="502575" wikidata="Q884015" url="?curid=502575" title="Edward Bishop Dudley">
<text>Edward Bishop Dudley (December 15, 1789 – October 30, 1855) was the 28th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1836 to 1841. He served in the United States House of Representatives as a Jacksonian from 1829 to 1831.

==Early life==
Born near Jacksonville, North Carolina, the son of Christopher Dudley, a wealthy farmer and businessman, and Margaret Snead. Dudley entered politics early in life. In 1811, at age twenty-one, he was elected to the lower house of the state legislature from Onslow County. He was reelected in 1812, and in 1814 he was elected to the North Carolina State Senate. During the War of 1812, between service in the legislature,
he was second in command of a regiment from Onslow. The regiment was stationed at Wilmington, and he liked the area and moved there permanently after the war. In 1815 he married Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; Henry Haywood; they had six children. After Eliza&#x27;s death he married the widow of General John Cowan.

==Entry into politics==
In 1816 Dudley won election to the lower house of the state legislature from the borough of Wilmington and won reelection in 1817. Dudley did not work with the &quot;Old Republicans,&quot; North
Carolina&#x27;s dominant political faction, but instead actively joined a group of opportunists who formed a &quot;People party&quot; ticket, and in 1824 Dudley was an elector. The People party won and gave
their vote to Andrew Jackson. In 1828, after the &quot;Old Republicans&quot; were also backing Jackson, Dudley was again a Jackson elector, and Jackson easily carried the state. Dudley&#x27;s support of Jackson would soon end. Gabriel Holmes, the congressman from Dudley&#x27;s district, died, and in 1829 Dudley won a special election to replace him. In his only term in Congress Dudley usually voted against Jackson&#x27;s party, and he chose not to run for reelection.

In 1831 and 1832 Dudley was active in a group, headed by former Secretary of the Navy John Branch, that denounced Martin Van Buren, whom Dudley opposed more vehemently than he did Jackson, while professing to support Jackson. The group nominated Jackson for president and Philip P. Barbour for vice president. Dudley served as an elector, but the Jackson-Barbour ticket was badly beaten. Nevertheless, this coalition of Van Buren&#x27;s enemies, which had at first received support from National Republicans, would reemerge in the 1830s as the Whig party, of which Dudley became a member.

In 1833 a bipartisan movement for statewide internal improvements formed, and Dudley was one of its most active leaders. A statewide meeting in Raleigh with Dudley its chairman demanded a state-supported railroad system. Dudley already was the leading investor in organizing the Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad, and in January 1834 he secured the first charter of the railroad from the state. He had personally invested $25,000, and $113,000 had been raised. In March 1836 the stockholders held their first meeting, and Dudley was elected the railroad&#x27;s first president with a salary of $2,000 a year. The actual building of the railroad began in October 1836.

==Governor==
In 1835 North Carolina&#x27;s old constitution was replaced by a new one. Dudley joined other eastern Carolina political leaders from both parties in agreeing to make limited concessions to
the West, and the new constitution called for direct election of the governor. Dudley was unanimously nominated as his party&#x27;s choice at a state convention. He accepted the nomination, declaring Van Buren &quot;a Northern man in soul, in principle and in action&quot; (Raleigh Register, 23 Feb. 1836). Southern sectionalism was a major Whig issue, and the party&#x27;s support for distributing the proceeds of public land sales to the states, a measure Jackson had vetoed, greatly helped Dudley. He won the election, defeating the incumbent Governor, Richard Dobbs Spaight by about 4,000 votes. Dudley was the first North Carolina governor elected by popular vote.

In his first term Dudley and his party were not able to dominate the state. A Democratic victory in a special election gave the Democrats a majority of the legislature. Whig senator Willie P. Magnum was replaced by a Democrat, and in November 1836 North Carolina voters endorsed Van Buren. The state had received almost $1.5 million as its share of money from the federal government&#x27;s &quot;deposit&quot; bill. The Whig plan, supported by Dudley, to use most of the money for railroads and the state bank was seriously amended by the Democrats, and the Democratic plan passed. This plan was the real beginning of a state internal improvements plan, but the Whigs took sole credit for the system, and Dudley was called the &quot;father of internal improvements&quot; in the state.

Dudley easily won reelection in 1838. A meeting of Wake County Democrats nominated Branch, who was in many ways the founder of the Whig party although he now called himself a Democrat. Many Democrats refused to recognize the nomination and stayed away from the polls. Dudley received 64 percent of the vote, the largest margin ever won by an antebellum candidate for governor.
He urged more aid to internal improvement and to public schools, but owing primarily to East-West sectionalism, he accomplished relatively little.

In 1840 Dudley, although still popular, was barred by the state constitution from running for reelection. He had resigned his Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad presidency in 1837, but he was
reelected as president of the railroad in 1841 and retained the position until 1847. The railroad, which never went to Raleigh, changed its name to the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad and at one time was the longest railroad in the world.

==Later life==
In 1847 Dudley retired from active leadership in the railroad. He remained a wealthy gentleman and an ardent Whig, and he entertained, among others, Secretary of State Daniel Webster and Senator Henry Clay. Dudley remained an important railroad developer and Whig leader, fitting the pattern of business interest in the party. He died at his home in Wilmington in 1855.

<text>Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz (English: &quot;Austerlitz station&quot;), officially Paris Austerlitz, is one of the seven large Paris railway terminal stations. The station is located on the left bank of the Seine in the southeastern part of the city, in the 13th arrondissement. It is the start of the Paris–Bordeaux railway; the line to Toulouse is connected to this line. In 1997, the Ministry of Culture designated the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz a historical monument; it became the fifth large railway station in Paris to receive such a label, as currently only Montparnasse has not been attributed it.

Since the opening of the LGV Atlantiqueending at Gare MontparnasseAusterlitz has lost most of its long-distance southwestern services. It is used by some 30 million passengers annually, about half the number passing through Montparnasse. The Elipsos Train Hotels (Trenhotel) operated jointly by Renfe and SNCF operated from here to Madrid and Barcelona from 2001 to 2013. They would leave in the early evening and arrive next morning. With the start of a direct TGV from Paris to Barcelona, on 15 December 2013, the Trenhotel services were discontinued.

==History==
===1840 station===

The Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz was the main station in Paris for the Paris-Orléans (PO) company and was originally called the Gare d&#x27;Orléans station. The station is near the Quai d&#x27;Austerlitz, and the bridge that gives it its name. These were named after the Czech town once known as Austerlitz (today Slavkov u Brna). Napoleon I defeated the Third Coalition there on 2 December 1805 at the Battle of Austerlitz.

Built from 1838, the first platform was built slightly back from the current location of the station by the architect Félix-Emmanuel Callet and began service on 20 September 1840, on the occasion of the opening of the Paris-Corbeil line, which was extended to Orléans in May 1843. Part of the rue Poliveau was cut by this construction, and another part, located near the Seine, took the name of rue Jouffroy.

The first expansion took place in 1846.

===1867 station===

Demolished, the station was rebuilt, from 1862 to 1869, by Pierre-Louis Renaud (1819–1897), chief architect of the Paris-Orléans company. It included a large hall made from iron, wide and long (the second largest in France after Bordeaux), designed by Ferdinand Mathieu and carried out by the construction workshops of Schneider &amp; Co at Le Creusot and Chalon-sur-Saône. This vast space was also used as a workshop for making gas balloons, during the Siege of Paris in 1870. Also built was the departure pavilion to the north, the perpendicular building of the restaurant buffet, the arrival pavilion to the south, as well as the Paris-Orléans railway administration building at the west end of the hall, on Place Valhubert, with a &quot;Belle Époque&quot; style façade. The administrative building was an extension of the iron hall, whose pediment was invisible from Place Valhubert. This arrangement, as well as the choice of side entrances, was unusual for a terminal station.

===Evolution since 1900===
 In 1900, the Paris-Orléans company extended its railway line towards the centre of the capital, with the Gare d&#x27;Orsay becoming the new head of line, when it entered service on 28 May on the occasion of the Exposition Universelle. The design was by architect Victor Laloux, and the construction by the contractor Léon Chagnaud. In 1906, the great hall of Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz was literally pierced through its width by the Metro 5 line by an extension of a viaduct crossing the Seine. An elevated station was located in the hall.

In 1910, during the great flood of the Seine, the station was flooded and rail traffic completely interrupted from 31 January to 9 February. During this period, the departure and arrival of the trains were terminated at Gare de Juvisy.

Since 1926, the Paris-Vierzon line was electrified to 1500 V, so no more steam engines entered Austerlitz. It was the first station in Paris to no longer receive a steam train.

In 1939, the Gare d&#x27;Orsay saw its function limited to suburban traffic, and the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz once again became a terminus station for the main lines. In 1979, a extension to the Orsay line was built in a tunnel along the bank of the Seine, connecting the line to the Gare des Invalides, the terminus of the Rive Gauche line to Versailles. This new Transversal Rive Gauche line is today the central section of Line C of the Parisian commuter rail system, the Réseau Express Régional (RER).

On 28 February 1997, parts of the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz were classified as monuments historiques, especially its facades and glass roof.

===Future===
A large refurbishment project of the Paris Austerlitz is currently under way. Four new platforms are being constructed and all the existing tracks are being refurbished. The interior will be rebuilt in order to handle LGV Sud-Est and LGV Atlantique services, partially transferred from the Gare de Lyon and Gare Montparnasse, both of which are at maximum capacity. All the work is planned to be completed by 2020, and will double the activity at the station.

<text>In astronomy, an octaeteris (, plural: octaeterides) is the period of eight solar years after which the moon phase occurs on the same day of the year plus one or two days.

This period is also in a very good synchronicity with five Venusian visibility cycles (the Venusian synodic period) and thirteen Venusian revolutions around the Sun (Venusian sidereal period). This means, that if Venus is visible beside the Moon, after eight years the two will be again close together near the same date of the calendar.

The octaeteris, also known as &quot;oktaeteris&quot;, was noted by Cleostratus in ancient Greece as a day cycle. The octaeteris is the calendar used for the Olympic games; if one Olympiad was 50 months long, the next would be 49 lunar months long. This octaeteris calendar is used for the Olympic dial of the Antikythera mechanism, to determine the time of the Olympic games and other Greek festivities.

The 8 year short lunisolar cycle was probably known to many ancient cultures. The mathematical proportions of the octaeteris cycles were The Three Kings panel also contains more accurate ratios, ratios related to other planets, and apparent astronomical symbolism.

<text>Richard Dobbs Spaight Jr. (1796November 17, 1850) was an American politician and planter who served as the 27th governor of North Carolina from 1835 to 1836. His father, Richard Dobbs Spaight, served as the eighth governor of North Carolina from 1792 to 1795.

==Biography==
Born in New Bern, North Carolina, Richard Dobbs Spaight Jr. was the son of Richard Dobbs Spaight. He was orphaned in 1802, when his father was killed in a duel; he later attended the University of North Carolina, graduating in 1815. Spaight studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1818; he was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1819 and the North Carolina Senate in 1820, where he served until being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1823.

Defeated for re-election to Congress, Spaight returned to the state legislature. He made repeated unsuccessful attempts to run for governor, defeated in 1827 (by James Iredell Jr.), 1828 (by John Owen), 1830, 1831 (by Montfort Stokes) and 1832 (by David Swain). Spaight was finally successful in 1835, becoming the last governor elected by the General Assembly under the North Carolina Constitution of 1776. As governor, he opposed state-funded internal improvements. Under the new North Carolina Constitution of 1835, Spaight ran in the first statewide popular election for governor, but was defeated by Edward B. Dudley. The Spaights were the first father and son to serve as governor. W. Kerr Scott and Robert W. Scott later achieved the same distinction. Spaight retired to his farm near New Bern.

<doc id="502581" wikidata="Q5619249" url="?curid=502581" title="Jeff Dee">
<text>Jeff Dee is an American artist and game designer. He was the youngest artist in the history of pioneering role-playing game company TSR when he began his work at the age of 18. He also designed the &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; superhero game. He was a co-host on &quot;The Atheist Experience&quot; and Non-Prophets atheism advocacy podcasts.

==Biography==
In the late 1970s, while Dee was still a teenager, he and Jack Herman created &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot;, the first complete superhero role-playing game. The game was published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1979. Dee and Herman persuaded Scott Bizar to produce a second edition, which was published in 1982. Dee came up with the idea of creating a role-playing game based on cartoons when he, Greg Costikyan, and other designers were discussing which genres had no role-playing game systems yet; although they agreed that it would be impossible for such a game to be designed, a few years later Costikyan designed &quot;Toon&quot; as a full game with the assistance of Warren Spector.

Dee was the youngest artist in TSR history when he began working for them at the age of 18. In 1997, with his partner &#x27;Manda, Dee founded UNIgames, a publisher of role-playing, board, and computer games. Dee designed a new superhero role-playing game originally titled &quot;Advanced Villains and Vigilantes&quot;, which was ultimately published as &quot;Living Legends&quot; in 2005. In 2009, he co-founded Nemesis Games, developers of an MMO named &quot;Gargantua&quot;.

Dee has long been an advocate for the role-playing game industry.

==Advocacy of atheism==
In addition to his artistic and game-related work, Dee is an outspoken atheist and transhumanist. He has been the host of a bi-weekly Internet podcast called &quot;The Non-Prophets&quot; and a former host of a live, weekly, public-access television program, &quot;The Atheist Experience&quot;.

<text>Quai de la Rapée () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving Line 5, located in the 12th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==

The station is located above ground between Pont Morland road bridge and the Voie Mazas, above the Saint-Martin canal, overhanging one of the locks leading to the Seine. The metro line connects to the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz metro station by crossing the Seine via the Viaduc d&#x27;Austerlitz after the track winds to the right around the Institut médico-légal de Paris (morgue) on a viaduct called the Viaduc du quai de la Rapée. Since the closure of the nearby Arsenal station in 1939, the Quai de la Rapée station also serves the Bassin de l&#x27;Arsenal. Gare de Lyon is about 600 meters to the southeast.

==History==
The station was opened in 1906, under the name &quot;Station Contrescarpe&quot;, the former name of the Boulevard de la Bastille. On 13 July 1906, Line 5 from the Place d&#x27;Italie crossed the Seine via the Viaduc d&#x27;Austerlitz to the station and temporarily became its terminus. From 1 August, in order to facilitate connections, the metro returned to Gare de Lyon station using a preserved service road. This operation lasted until 17 December 1906, on which the line was extended to the Lancry (Jacques Bonsergent from 1946) station. From the station, the tracks plunge abruptly into tunnels at either end and it was submerged during the historic flood of 1910. The station is named after the Sieur de la Rapée, commissioner of war under Louis XV.

In 2018, the station had 1,273,466 passengers access it, which placed it at the 288th position out of 302 metro stations.

==Services for passengers==
===Access===
The station has a single access from Place Mazas.

===Station layout===


===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 72 of the RATP Bus Network, and at short distance by lines 24, 57, 61, 63 and 91 of the RATP bus network and, at night, by lines N01, N02 and N31 of the Noctilien network.

<text>David Lowry Swain (January 4, 1801August 27, 1868) was the 26th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina, from 1832 to 1835.

==Early life==

He was born in Buncombe County, North Carolina; his father, George Swain, was a farmer and a member of the North Carolina General Assembly.

He received his early education at New Academy near Asheville and briefly attended the University of North Carolina, where he was a member of the Dialectic Society. Swain left his university studies in 1821 after only four months to study law with Chief Justice John Louis Taylor of the North Carolina Supreme Court; he was admitted to the bar in 1823.

==Career==

The citizens of Buncombe County chose Swain as their representative in the North Carolina General Assembly from 1824 to 1830; he was appointed to the state Superior Court as a judge, serving from 1830 to 1832.

Swain resigned as a judge to accept the vote of the North Carolina General Assembly to serve as governor; at the time he was the youngest governor in state history, and the first to belong to the Whig Party. As governor, Swain was a promoter of internal improvements, including railroads and education, although he received little support form the legislature. In 1835, he was a leading delegate to the state constitutional convention; his last act as governor was to issue the proclamation declaring the ratification of 1835&#x27;s extensive amendments to the Constitution of North Carolina.

After serving the constitutional limit of three one-year terms, Swain was named president of the University of North Carolina in 1835; he held this post for 33 years and promoted the growth of the institution.

During the American Civil War, Swain was drawn back into North Carolina politics; he represented the state at an 1861 Confederate convention, but declined a position in the Confederate Senate in 1863. In 1865, Swain helped negotiate the surrender of Raleigh to the forces of General William Sherman, and, following the end of the war, advised U.S. president Andrew Johnson on Reconstruction policies.

Although Swain had attempted, facing serious challenges, to keep the University of North Carolina open during the course of the war, by 1868, the school was suffering financially, and, at the request of a new board of trustees appointed by the state legislature, he resigned. On August 11, 1868, he was thrown from a buggy pulled by a horse that General Sherman had given him. Though confined to bed due to shock and weakness, Swain appeared to be recovering, but he succumbed to his injuries on August 27. He was buried in the garden of his home in Chapel Hill, but was later reinterred in the Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, N.C.

<text>Montfort Stokes (March 12, 1762November 4, 1842) was an American Democratic (originally Democratic-Republican) politician who served as U.S. Senator from 1816 to 1823, and the 25th Governor of North Carolina from 1830 to 1832.

== Biography ==
Born in Lunenburg County in the Colony of Virginia, Stokes was the youngest of the eleven children of David Stokes, a military officer and judge. At the age of 13, he enlisted in the United States Merchant Marine. During the American Revolutionary War, Stokes was captured by the British and confined for seven months on the British prison ship &quot;Jersey&quot; in New York Harbor. He later held the rank of major general in the state militia from 1804 to 1816.

After the Revolutionary War, Stokes settled in Salisbury, North Carolina, farmed, served as clerk of court, and studied law. There, he first met Andrew Jackson, a fellow lawyer. He served as assistant clerk in the North Carolina Senate from 1786 to 1790, was a U.S. House candidate in 1793, and as clerk from 1799 to 1816, until he was elected to the United States Senate following the resignation of James Turner. He served the remaining few months of Turner&#x27;s term and then a full term in the Senate, but was defeated for re-election by the legislature in 1823. He had previously been elected to the Senate in 1804, but had declined the seat. During his Senate term Stokes changed his residency from Salisbury to Wilkesboro, North Carolina, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Stokes was then elected to the North Carolina General Assembly; he represented Wilkes County in the North Carolina Senate from 1826 to 1827 and the North Carolina House of Commons from 1829 to 1830.

In 1830, Stokes was elected Governor by the General Assembly on the ninth ballot, defeating Cadwallader Jones and Richard Dobbs Spaight Jr. Stokes faced Spaight for re-election again the following year and was elected by a narrow margin (98–93). During his term in office, Stokes supported construction of canals along the North Carolina Coast; he simultaneously served as president of the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees.

A strong supporter of President Andrew Jackson, Governor Stokes urged the state legislature to support Jackson&#x27;s anti-nullification position; Stokes was named by Jackson to head the Federal Indian Commission, overseeing relocation and resettlement of Indian tribes from the American southeast, and resigned as governor on November 19, 1832.

With his new position, Stokes moved to Fort Gibson in the Arkansas Territory (now part of the state of Oklahoma) and advocated for the Cherokee, Seneca, Shawnee, and Quapaw tribes. He died in November 1842 and is buried near Fort Gibson. Stokes is believed to be the only soldier of the American Revolutionary War buried in Oklahoma.

In 1943, a United States Liberty ship named the SS &quot;Montfort Stokes&quot; was launched. She was scrapped in 1962.

== Family ==
Stokes first married Mary Irwin and they had one daughter. After his wife died, he married Rachel Montgomery (1776–1862) and they had five sons and five daughters. His son, Montfort Sidney Stokes, fought as major in the Mexican–American War and died in 1862 in the Civil War as colonel of the 1st North Carolina Infantry Regiment.

<text>Reuilly–Diderot () is a station on lines 1 and 8 of the Paris Métro in the 12th arrondissement.

== History ==
The station opened as &quot;Reuilly&quot; 13 August 1900, a month after trains began running on the initial section of line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900. Until then, the trains passed through without stopping. It was then named after the nearby rue Reuilly as it once led to the &quot;Château de Reuilly&quot;, a now destroyed former palace located in the old town of Reuilly – now part of the 12th arrondissement.

On 5 May 1931, line 8&#x27;s platforms opened as part of its extension from Richelieu–Drouot to Porte de Charenton. The station was subsequently renamed &quot;Reuilly–Diderot&quot;, its current name. &quot;Diderot&quot; referred to the nearby &quot;Boulevard Diderot&quot;, which in turn was renamed in 1879 after Denis Diderot (1713-1784), a prominent writer and philosopher during the Age of Enlightenment.

In the 1930s, the platforms of line 1 were extended to 105 metres to cater for 7-car trains, a plan which ultimately did not materialise.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 31 March 2008. The platforms of line 1 were closed to raise its platform levels over the weekend of 31 May to 1 June 2008 as part of its automation. This was for the installation platform screen doors to improve passenger safety and for automation, which were done in March 2011. The line was fully automated in December 2012.

In 2019, the station was used by 6,328,040 passengers, making it the 52nd busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 3,860,750 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 30th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 4,580,091 passengers, making it the 44th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 4 accesses:

* Access 1: Boulevard Diderot
* Access 2: rue Claude Tillier
* Access 3: rue de Reuilly
* Access 4: rue de Chaligny

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Both lines have a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms, although line 1&#x27;s platforms have had platform screen doors installed since March 2011. Line 8&#x27;s platforms are curved and the increased height of its vault along with the lower portion of its side walls being vertical instead of elliptical distinguishes it from the other stations on the line.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 46, 57, and 215 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by line N11 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Muckle Roe is an island in Shetland, Scotland, in St. Magnus Bay, to the west of Mainland. It has a population of around 130 people, who mainly croft and live in the south east of the island.

&#x27;Muckle&#x27; is Scots for &#x27;big&#x27; or &#x27;great&#x27;.

== History ==
The island is referred to in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;.

In 1905 a bridge was built between Muckle Roe and the Shetland Mainland over Roe Sound at a cost of £1,020 met from public subscription and a grant from the Congested Districts Board. The construction was of iron and concrete and its completion was followed by a reversal in the population decline seen in the 19th and earlier 20th centuries. The bridge was later widened and strengthened, and opened on 22 October 1947 by the Convener of Zetland, W. Thomson Esq. Construction of a replacement bridge commenced in May 1998, the work being completed in January 1999. It was opened officially by Councillor Drew Ratter on 3 April 1999.

Muckle Roe was part of the civil parish of Delting until the abolition of civil parishes in Scotland by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929.

== Geography and geology ==
Muckle Roe is approximately in diameter, with high cliffs in the south. Its highest point is Mid Ward . It is the seventh largest of the Shetland islands.

The island&#x27;s rock is red granite, which gives the island its name – a combination of Scots and Old Norse meaning &quot;big red island&quot;.

There are crofts in the east and south east. The rest of the island is lochan-studded moorland.

== Population ==
==Notable residents==
Gilbert Williamson Wood (2 September 1828 – 24 September 1886), a merchant seaman, was born at Little Ayre and emigrated to Adelaide, Australia in 1853. He founded G. Wood, Son &amp; Co. along with his eldest son Peter in 1876. The company produced goods under a number of brand names, including Anchor, Snowflake, Viking, and Medallion. He donated sums of money back to Muckle Roe, including funds towards the building of the first bridge to mainland Shetland, and the Muckle Roe Church of Scotland, which was completed in 1911. The remaining funds were used to purchase books and school bags for every child attending the local school. Some profits from the sale of Anchor butter went towards paraffin lamps for the chapel.

<text>John Owen (August 21, 1787October 9, 1841) was the 24th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina and the state&#x27;s first Democratic governor from 1828 to 1830.

==Biography==
Owen was born in Bladen County, North Carolina; he was the son of Thomas Owen, a judge and member of the state legislature. He briefly attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but did not earn a degree.

In 1812, Owen was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons and served there for two years; he was later elected to the North Carolina Senate (1819–1820, 1827–1828). He served on the North Carolina Council of State from 1824 to 1827 under governors Hutchins Gordon Burton and James Iredell Jr. Owen returned to the state senate in 1827 but was elected governor by the General Assembly in December 1828, narrowly defeating Richard Dobbs Spaight Jr. in a vote of 96 to 92.

Owen served two consecutive one-year terms as governor, during which he promoted education and served concurrently as President of the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees. He was nominated for a third term as governor, but declined the nomination; that same year, he lost by one vote (to Willie Mangum) a bid to represent North Carolina in the United States Senate.

In 1831, Omar ibn Said, the slave of John&#x27;s brother James, wrote: Ibn Said further wrote of John&#x27;s family:

In 1835, Owen was a prominent member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention; there, he supported enfranchisement of land-owning Negro citizens and opposed religious tests for officeholders.

Although during his earlier political life, Owen affiliated himself with the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, in 1839, he presided over the first state convention of the emerging Whig Party; three weeks later, he served as president of the National Whig Convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Owen was offered the vice-presidential position on the Whig presidential ticket of William Henry Harrison; he turned down the nomination. Had he accepted, Owen might have become President of the United States following Harrison&#x27;s death early in office instead of John Tyler.

Owen retired to his farm in Chatham County, North Carolina, where he died while in Pittsboro on October 9, 1841 (Raleigh Register and North-Carolina Gazette, Raleigh, NC, October 19, 1841, page 3, column 5); he is buried in the churchyard of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Pittsboro, North Carolina.

<text>Google Groups is a service from Google that provides discussion groups for people sharing common interests. Until February 2024, the Groups service also provided a gateway to Usenet newsgroups, both reading and posting to them, via a shared user interface. In addition to accessing Google groups, registered users can also set up mailing list archives for e-mail lists that are hosted elsewhere.

Google Groups became operational in February 2001, following Google&#x27;s acquisition of Deja&#x27;s Usenet archive. Deja News had been operational since March 1995.

Google Groups allows any user to freely conduct and access threaded discussions, via either a web interface or e-mail. There are at least two kinds of discussion groups: forums specific to Google Groups (like mailing lists) and Usenet groups, accessible by NNTP, for which Google Groups acts as gateway and unofficial archive. The Google Groups archive of Usenet newsgroup postings dates back to 1981.

On December 15, 2023, Google announced that Google Groups would end support posting or viewing new Usenet content on February 22, 2024, with existing archives remaining available.

==History==

===Deja News===

The Deja News Research Service was an archive of messages posted to Usenet discussion groups, started in March 1995 by Steve Madere in Austin, Texas. Its search engine capabilities won the service acclaim, generated controversy, and significantly changed the perceived nature of online discussion. This archive was acquired by Google in 2001.

While archives of Usenet discussions had been kept for as long as the medium existed, Deja News offered a novel combination of features. It was available to the general public, provided a simple World Wide Web user interface, allowed searches across all archived newsgroups, returned immediate results, and retained messages indefinitely. The search facilities transformed Usenet from a loosely organized and ephemeral communication tool into a valued information repository. The archive&#x27;s relative permanence, combined with the ability to search messages by author, raised concerns about privacy and confirmed often-repeated past admonishments that posters should be cautious in discussing themselves and others.

While Madere was initially reluctant to remove archived material, protests from users and legal pressure led to the introduction of &quot;nuking&quot;, a method for posters to permanently remove their own messages from search results. It already supported the use of an &quot;X-No-Archive&quot; message header, which if present would cause an article to be omitted from the archive. This did not prevent others from quoting the material in a later message and causing it to be stored. Copyright holders were also allowed to have material removed from the archive. According to Humphrey Marr of Deja News, copyright actions most frequently came from the Church of Scientology.

The capability to &quot;nuke&quot; postings was kept open for many years but later removed without explanation under Google&#x27;s tenure. Google also mistakenly restored previously &quot;nuked&quot; messages at one point, angering many users. &quot;Nukes&quot; that were in effect at the time when Google removed the possibility are still honored, however. Since May 2014, European users can request to have search results for their name from Google Groups, including their Usenet archive, delinked under the right to be forgotten law. As of 2015, Google Groups was one of the ten most delinked sites. If Google does not grant a delinking, Europeans can appeal to their local data protection agencies.

===Change of direction===

The service was eventually expanded beyond search. &quot;My Deja News&quot; offered the ability to read Usenet in the traditional chronological, per-group manner, and to post new messages to the network. Deja Communities were private Internet forums offered primarily to businesses. In 1999 the site (now known as Deja.com) made its primary feature a shopping comparison service. During this transition, which involved relocation of the servers, many older messages in the Usenet archive became unavailable. By late 2000 the company, in financial distress, sold the shopping service to eBay, who incorporated the technology into their half.com services.

===Google Groups===

By 2001, the Deja search service was shut down. In February 2001, Google acquired Deja News and its archive, and transitioned its assets to groups.google.com. Users were then able to access these Usenet newsgroups through the new Google Groups interface.

By the end of 2001, the archive had been supplemented with other archived messages dating back to May 11, 1981. These early posts from 1981 to 1991 were donated to Google by the University of Western Ontario, based on archives by Henry Spencer from the University of Toronto. A short while later, Google released a new version that allowed users to create their own non-Usenet groups.

When AOL discontinued access to Usenet around 2005, it recommended Google Groups instead.

In 2008, Google broke the Groups search functionality and left it nonfunctional for about a year, until a &quot;Wired&quot; article spurred the company to fix the problems.

On February 13, 2015, a Vice Media story reported that the ability to perform advanced searches across all groups had again become nonfunctional, and to date, Google has neither fixed nor acknowledged the problem. The researcher interviewed stated, &quot;Advanced searches within specific groups appear to be working, but that&#x27;s hardly useful for any form of research—be it casual or academic.&quot;

As of January 2024, Google Groups carries a header notice, saying:

An explanatory page adds:

==Criticism==
&quot;Vice&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot; contributors have criticized Google for its unannounced discontinuation of the Google Groups Advanced Search page. The advanced search page allowed users to perform advanced searches across all groups. Without this page, it became difficult to find specific postings from among a multi-decade archive of posts across multiple newsgroups.

===Blocking===
Google Groups was blocked in Turkey on April 10, 2008, by a court order. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the court banned Google Groups following a libel complaint by Adnan Oktar against the service. Google Groups was the first of several websites to be blocked by the Turkish government in rapid succession solely for including material that allegedly offended Islam. The ban was removed a month later on May 15, 2008.
