<text>Actor–network theory (ANT) is a theoretical and methodological approach to social theory where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationships. It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans.

ANT holds that social forces do not exist in themselves, and therefore cannot be used to explain social phenomena. Instead, strictly empirical analysis should be undertaken to &quot;describe&quot; rather than &quot;explain&quot; social activity. Only after this can one introduce the concept of social forces, and only as an abstract theoretical concept, not something which genuinely exists in the world.

Although it is best known for its controversial insistence on the capacity of nonhumans to act or participate in systems or networks or both, ANT is also associated with forceful critiques of conventional and critical sociology. Developed by science and technology studies (STS) scholars Michel Callon, Madeleine Akrich and Bruno Latour, the sociologist John Law, and others, it can more technically be described as a &quot;material-semiotic&quot; method. This means that it maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and semiotic (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both material and semiotic. The term actor-network theory was coined by John Law in 1992 to describe the work being done across case studies in different areas at the Centre de Sociologie de l&#x27;Innovation at the time.

The theory demonstrates that everything in the social and natural worlds, human and nonhuman, interacts in shifting networks of relationships without any other elements out of the networks. ANT challenges many traditional approaches by defining nonhumans as actors equal to humans. This claim provides a new perspective when applying the theory in practice.

Broadly speaking, ANT is a constructivist approach in that it avoids essentialist explanations of events or innovations (i.e. ANT explains a successful theory by understanding the combinations and interactions of elements that make it successful, rather than saying it is true and the others are false). Likewise, it is not a cohesive theory in itself. Rather, ANT functions as a strategy that assists people in being sensitive to terms and the often unexplored assumptions underlying them. It is distinguished from many other STS and sociological network theories for its distinct material-semiotic approach.

==Background and context==
ANT was first developed at the Centre de Sociologie de l&#x27;Innovation (CSI) of the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris in the early 1980s by staff (Michel Callon, Madeleine Akrich, Bruno Latour) and visitors (including John Law). The 1984 book co-authored by John Law and fellow-sociologist Peter Lodge (&quot;Science for Social Scientists&quot;; London: Macmillan Press Ltd.) is a good example of early explorations of how the growth and structure of knowledge could be analyzed and interpreted through the interactions of actors and networks. Initially created in an attempt to understand processes of innovation and knowledge-creation in science and technology, the approach drew on existing work in STS, on studies of large technological systems, and on a range of French intellectual resources including the semiotics of Algirdas Julien Greimas, the writing of philosopher Michel Serres, and the Annales School of history.

ANT appears to reflect many of the preoccupations of French post-structuralism, and in particular a concern with non-foundational and multiple material-semiotic relations. At the same time, it was much more firmly embedded in English-language academic traditions than most post-structuralist-influenced approaches. Its grounding in (predominantly English) science and technology studies was reflected in an intense commitment to the development of theory through qualitative empirical case-studies. Its links with largely US-originated work on large technical systems were reflected in its willingness to analyse large scale technological developments in an even-handed manner to include political, organizational, legal, technical and scientific factors.

Many of the characteristic ANT tools (including the notions of translation, generalized symmetry and the &quot;heterogeneous network&quot;), together with a scientometric tool for mapping innovations in science and technology (&quot;co-word analysis&quot;) were initially developed during the 1980s, predominantly in and around the CSI. The &quot;state of the art&quot; of ANT in the late 1980s is well-described in Latour&#x27;s 1987 text, &quot;Science in Action&quot;.

From about 1990 onwards, ANT started to become popular as a tool for analysis in a range of fields beyond STS. It was picked up and developed by authors in parts of organizational analysis, informatics, health studies, geography, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, feminist studies, technical communication, and economics.

, ANT is a widespread, if controversial, range of material-semiotic approaches for the analysis of heterogeneous relations. In part because of its popularity, it is interpreted and used in a wide range of alternative and sometimes incompatible ways. There is no orthodoxy in current ANT, and different authors use the approach in substantially different ways. Some authors talk of &quot;after-ANT&quot; to refer to &quot;successor projects&quot; blending together different problem-focuses with those of ANT.

==Key concepts ==

=== Actor/Actant ===
An actor (actant) is something that acts or to which activity is granted by others. It implies no motivation of human individual actors nor of humans in general. An actant can literally be anything provided it is granted to be the source of action. In another word, an actor, in this circumstance, is considered as any entity that does things. For example, in the &quot;Pasteur Network&quot;, microorganisms are not inert, they cause unsterilized materials to ferment while leaving behind sterilized materials not affected. If they took other actions, that is, if they did not cooperate with Pasteur – if they did not take action (at least according to Pasteur&#x27;s intentions) – then Pasteur&#x27;s story may be a bit different. It is in this sense that Latour can refer to microorganisms as actors.

Under the framework of ANT, the principle of generalized symmetry requires all entities must be described in the same terms before a network is considered. Any differences between entities are generated in the network of relations, and do not exist before any network is applied.

==== Human actors ====
Human normally refers to human beings and their human behaviors.

==== Nonhuman actors ====
Traditionally, nonhuman entities are creatures including plants, animals, geology, and natural forces, as well as a collective human making of arts, languages. In ANT, nonhuman covers multiple entities including things, objects, animals, natural phenomena, material structures, transportation devices, texts, and economic goods. But nonhuman actors do not cover entities such as humans, supernatural beings, and other symbolic objects in nature.

=== Actor-Network ===
As the term implies, the actor-network is the central concept in ANT. The term &quot;network&quot; is somewhat problematic in that it, as Latour notes, has a number of unwanted connotations. Firstly, it implies that what is described takes the shape of a network, which is not necessarily the case. Secondly, it implies &quot;transportation without deformation,&quot; which, in ANT, is not possible since any actor-network involves a vast number of translations. Latour, however, still contends that network is a fitting term to use, because &quot;it has no a priori order relation; it is not tied to the axiological myth of a top and of a bottom of society; it makes absolutely no assumption whether a specific locus is macro- or micro- and does not modify the tools to study the element &#x27;a&#x27; or the element &#x27;b&#x27;.&quot; This use of the term &quot;network&quot; is very similar to Deleuze and Guattari&#x27;s rhizomes; Latour even remarks tongue-in-cheek that he would have no objection to renaming ANT &quot;actant-rhizome ontology&quot; if it only had sounded better, which hints at Latour&#x27;s uneasiness with the word &quot;theory&quot;.

Actor–network theory tries to explain how material–semiotic networks come together to act as a whole; the clusters of actors involved in creating meaning are both material and semiotic. As a part of this it may look at explicit strategies for relating different elements together into a network so that they form an apparently coherent whole. These networks are potentially transient, existing in a constant making and re-making. This means that relations need to be repeatedly &quot;performed&quot; or the network will dissolve. They also assume that networks of relations are not intrinsically coherent, and may indeed contain conflicts. Social relations, in other words, are only ever in process, and must be performed continuously.

The Pasteur story that was mentioned above introduced the patterned network of diverse materials, which is called the idea of &#x27;heterogenous networks&#x27;. The basic idea of patterned network is that human is not the only factor or contributor in the society, or in any social activities and networks. Thus, the network composes machines, animals, things, and any other objects. For those nonhuman actors, it might be hard for people to imagine their roles in the network. For example, say two people, Jacob and Mike, are speaking through texts. Within the current technology, they are able to communicate with each other without seeing each other in person. Therefore, when typing or writing, the communication is basically not mediated by either of them, but instead by a network of objects, like their computers or cell phones.

If taken to its logical conclusion, then, nearly any actor can be considered merely a sum of other, smaller actors. A car is an example of a complicated system. It contains many electronic and mechanical components, all of which are essentially hidden from view to the driver, who simply deals with the car as a single object. This effect is known as &quot;punctualisation&quot;, and is similar to the idea of encapsulation in object-oriented programming.

When an actor network breaks down, the punctualisation effect tends to cease as well. In the automobile example above, a non-working engine would cause the driver to become aware of the car as a collection of parts rather than just a vehicle capable of transporting him or her from place to place. This can also occur when elements of a network act contrarily to the network as a whole. In his book &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Hope&quot;, Latour likens depunctualization to the opening of a black box. When closed, the box is perceived simply as a box, although when it is opened all elements inside it become visible.

=== Translation ===
Central to ANT is the concept of translation which is sometimes referred to as sociology of translation, in which innovators attempt to create a &quot;forum&quot;, a central network in which all the actors agree that the network is worth building and defending. In his widely debated 1986 study of how marine biologists tried to restock the St Brieuc Bay in order to produce more scallops, Michel Callon defined 4 moments of translation:

# Problematisation: The researchers attempted to make themselves important to the other players in the drama by identifying their nature and issues, then claiming that they could be remedied if the actors negotiated the &#x27;obligatory passage point&#x27; of the researchers&#x27; study program.
# Interessement: A series of procedures used by the researchers to bind the other actors to the parts that had been assigned to them in that program.
# Enrollment: A collection of tactics used by the researchers to define and connect the numerous roles they had assigned to others.
# Mobilisation: The researchers utilized a series of approaches to ensure that ostensible spokespeople for various key collectivities were appropriately able to represent those collectivities and were not deceived by the latter.

Also important to the notion is the role of network objects in helping to smooth out the translation process by creating equivalencies between what would otherwise be very challenging people, organizations or conditions to mesh together. Bruno Latour spoke about this particular task of objects in his work &quot;Reassembling the Social&quot;.

=== Quasi-object ===
For the rethinking of social relations as networks, Latour mobilizes a concept from Michel Serres and expands on it in order “to locate the position of these strange new hybrids”. Quasi-objects are simultaneously quasi-subjects – the prefix &quot;quasi &quot;denotes that neither ontological status as subject or object is pure or permanent, but that these are dynamic entities whose status shifts, depending on their respective momentous activity and their according position in a collective or network. What is decisive is circulation and participation, from which networks emerge, examples for quasi-objects are language, money, bread, love, or the ball in a soccer game: all of these human or non-human, material or immaterial actants have no agency (and thus, subject-status) in themselves, however, they can be seen as the connective tissue underlying – or even acticating – the interactions in which they are enmeshed. In &quot;Reassembling the Social&quot;, Latour refers to these in-between actants as “the mediators whose proliferation generates, among many other entities, what could be called quasi-objects and quasi-subjects.”

Actor–network theory refers to these creations as &quot;tokens&quot; or &quot;quasi-objects&quot; which are passed between actors within the network. As the token is increasingly transmitted or passed through the network, it becomes increasingly punctualized and also increasingly reified. When the token is decreasingly transmitted, or when an actor fails to transmit the token (e.g., the oil pump breaks), punctualization and reification are decreased as well.

==Other central concepts==

=== A material semiotic method ===
Although it is called a &quot;theory&quot;, ANT does not usually explain &quot;why&quot; a network takes the form that it does. Rather, ANT is a way of thoroughly exploring the relational ties within a network (which can be a multitude of different things). As Latour notes, &quot;explanation does not follow from description; it is description taken that much further.&quot; It is not, in other words, a theory &quot;of&quot; anything, but rather a method, or a &quot;how-to book&quot; as Latour puts it.

The approach is related to other versions of material-semiotics (notably the work of philosophers Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, and feminist scholar Donna Haraway). It can also be seen as a way of being faithful to the insights of ethnomethodology and its detailed descriptions of how common activities, habits and procedures sustain themselves. Similarities between ANT and symbolic interactionist approaches such as the newer forms of grounded theory like situational analysis, exist, although Latour objects to such a comparison.

Although ANT is mostly associated with studies of science and technology and with the sociology of science, it has been making steady progress in other fields of sociology as well. ANT is adamantly empirical, and as such yields useful insights and tools for sociological inquiry in general. ANT has been deployed in studies of identity and subjectivity, urban transportation systems, and passion and addiction. It also makes steady progress in political and historical sociology.

=== Intermediaries and mediators ===
The distinction between intermediaries and mediators is key to ANT sociology. Intermediaries are entities which make no difference (to some interesting state of affairs which we are studying) and so can be ignored. They transport the force of some other entity more or less without transformation and so are fairly uninteresting. Mediators are entities which multiply difference and so should be the object of study. Their outputs cannot be predicted by their inputs. From an ANT point of view sociology has tended to treat too much of the world as intermediaries.

For instance, a sociologist might take silk and nylon as intermediaries, holding that the former &quot;means&quot;, &quot;reflects&quot;, or &quot;symbolises&quot; the upper classes and the latter the lower classes. In such a view the real world silk–nylon difference is irrelevant– presumably many other material differences could also, and do also, transport this class distinction. But taken as mediators these fabrics would have to be engaged with by the analyst in their specificity: the internal real-world complexities of silk and nylon suddenly appear relevant, and are seen as actively constructing the ideological class distinction which they once merely reflected.

For the committed ANT analyst, social things—like class distinctions in taste in the silk and nylon example, but also groups and power—must constantly be constructed or performed anew through complex engagements with complex mediators. There is no stand-alone social repertoire lying in the background to be reflected off, expressed through, or substantiated in, interactions (as in an intermediary conception).

=== Reflexivity ===
Bruno Latour&#x27;s articulation of reflexivity in Actor-Network Theory (ANT) reframes it as an opportunity rather than a problem. His argument addresses the limitations of reflexivity as traditionally conceived in relativist epistemologies and replaces it with a pragmatic, relational approach tied to ANT&#x27;s broader principles. Latour argues that the observer is merely one actor among many within the network, eliminating the problem of reflexivity as a paradox of status. Reflexivity instead emerges through the tangible work of navigating and translating between networks, requiring the observer to engage actively, like any other actor, in the labour of connection and translation. This grounded form of reflexivity enhances the observer&#x27;s role as a &quot;world builder&quot; and reinforces ANT&#x27;s emphasis on the relational and dynamic nature of knowledge creation.

=== Hybridity ===
The belief that neither a human nor a nonhuman is pure, in the sense that neither is human or nonhuman in an absolute sense, but rather beings created via interactions between the two. Humans are thus regarded as quasi-subjects, while nonhumans are regarded as quasi-objects.

== Actor–network theory and specific disciplines ==
Recently, there has been a movement to introduce actor network theory as an analytical tool to a range of applied disciplines outside of sociology, including nursing, public health, urban studies (Farias and Bender, 2010), and community, urban, and regional planning (Beauregard, 2012; Beauregard and Lieto, 2015; Rydin, 2012; Rydin and Tate, 2016, Tate, 2013).

=== International relations ===
Actor–network theory has become increasingly prominent within the discipline of international relations and political science.

Theoretically, scholars within IR have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.), consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR, explore the infrastructures of world politics, and consider the effects of technological agency.

Empirically, IR scholars have drawn on insights from ANT in order to study phenomena including political violences like the use of torture and drones, piracy and maritime governance, and garbage.

=== Design ===
The actor–network theory can also be applied to design, using a perspective that is not simply limited to an analysis of an object&#x27;s structure. From the ANT viewpoint, design is seen as a series of features that account for a social, psychological, and economical world. ANT argues that objects are designed to shape human action and mold or influence decisions. In this way, the objects&#x27; design serves to mediate human relationships and can even impact our morality, ethics, and politics.

=== Literary criticism ===
The literary critic Rita Felski has argued that ANT offers the fields of literary criticism and cultural studies vital new modes of interpreting and engaging with literary texts. She claims that Latour&#x27;s model has the capacity to allow &quot;us to wiggle out of the straitjacket of suspicion,&quot; and to offer meaningful solutions to the problems associated with critique. The theory has been crucial to her formulation of postcritique. Felski suggests that the purpose of applying ANT to literary studies &quot;is no longer to diminish or subtract from the reality of the texts we study but to amplify their reality, as energetic coactors and vital partners.&quot;

=== Anthropology of religion===
In the study of Christianity by anthropologists, the ANT has been employed in a variety of ways of understanding how humans interact with nonhuman actors. Some have been critical of the field of Anthropology of Religion in its tendency to presume that God is not a social actor. The ANT is used to problematize the role of God, as a nonhuman actor, and speak of how They affect religious practice. Others have used the ANT to speak of the structures and placements of religious buildings, especially in cross-cultural contexts, which can see architecture as agents making God&#x27;s presence tangible.

== ANT in practice ==
ANT has been considered more than just a theory, but also a methodology. In fact, ANT is a useful method that can be applied in different studies. Moreover, with the development of the digital communication, ANT now is popular in being applied in science field like IS research. In addition, it widen the horizon of researchers from arts field as well.

=== ANT in arts ===
ANT is a big influencer in the development of design. In the past, researchers or scholars from design field mainly view the world as a human interactive situation. No matter what design we [] applied, it is for human&#x27;s action. However, the idea of ANT now applies into design principle, where design starts to be viewed as a connector. As the view of design itself has changed, the design starts to be considered more important in daily lives. Scholars [] analyze how design shapes, connects, reflects, interacts our daily activities.

ANT has also been widely applied in museums. ANT proposes that it is difficult to discern the &#x27;hard&#x27; from the &#x27;soft&#x27; components of the apparatus in curatorial practice; that the object &#x27;in progress&#x27; of being curated is slick and difficult to separate from the setting of the experiment or the experimenter&#x27;s identity.

=== ANT in science ===
In recent years, actor-network theory has gained a lot of traction, and a growing number of IS academics are using it explicitly in their research. Despite the fact that these applications vary greatly, all of the scholars cited below agree that the theory provides new notions and ideas for understanding the socio-technical character of information systems. Bloomfield present an intriguing case study of the development of a specific set of resource management information systems in the UK National Health Service, and they evaluate their findings using concepts from actor-network theory. The actor-network approach does not prioritize social or technological aspects, which mirrors the situation in the case study, where arguments about social structures and technology are intertwined within actors&#x27; discourse as they try to persuade others to align with their own goals. The research emphasizes the interpretative flexibility of information technology and systems, in the sense that seemingly similar systems produce drastically different outcomes in different locales as a result of the specific translation and network-building processes that occurred. They show how the boundary between the technological and the social, as well as the link between them, is the topic of constant battles and trials of strength in the creation of facts, rather than taking technology for granted.

==Impact of ANT==

=== Contributions of nonhuman actors ===
There are at least four contributions of nonhumans as actors in their ANT positions.

# Nonhuman actors can be considered as a condition in human social activities. Through the human&#x27;s formation of nonhuman actors such as durable materials, they provide a stable foundation for interactions in society. Reciprocally, nonhumans&#x27; actions and capacities serve as a condition for the possibility of the formation of society.
#* In Latour&#x27;s &quot;We Have Never Been Modern&quot;&quot;,&quot; his conceptual &quot;parliament of things&quot; consists of social, natural, and discourse together as hybrids. Although the interlocks between human actors and nonhumans effects the modernized society, this parliamentary setting based on nonhuman actors would eliminate such fake modernization, and changes the dichotomy between modern society and premodern society.
# Nonhuman actors can be considered as mediators. On the one hand, nonhumans could constantly modify relations between actors. On the other hand, nonhumans share the same features with other actors not solely as means for human actors. In this circumstance, nonhuman actors impact human interactions. It either creates an atmosphere for humans to agree with each other, or lead to conflict as the mediators.
#* It is noticeable that the status of mediation is more affiliated with intermediaries or means as a stable presence in the corpus of ANT, while mediators function more powers to influence actors and networks. Technical mediation exerts itself on four dimensions: interference, composition, the folding of time and space, and crossing the boundary between signs and things.
# Nonhuman actors can be considered as members of moral and political associations. For example, noise is a nonhuman actor if the topic is applied to actor-network theory. Noise is the criteria for humans to regulate themselves to morality, and subject to the limitations inherent in some legal rules for its political effects. After nonhumans are visible actors through their associations with morality and politics, these collectives become inherently regulative principles in social networks.
# Nonhuman actors can be considered as gatherings. Alike nonhumans&#x27; impacts on morality and politics, they could gather actors from other times and spaces. Interacted with variable ontologies, times, spaces, and durability, nonhumans exert subtle influences within a network.

== Criticism ==

Some critics have argued that research based on ANT perspectives remains entirely descriptive and fails to provide explanations for social processes. ANT—like comparable social scientific methods—requires judgement calls from the researcher as to which actors are important within a network and which are not. Critics argue that the importance of particular actors cannot be determined in the absence of &quot;out-of-network&quot; criteria, such as is a logically proven fact about deceptively coherent systems given Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. Similarly, others argue that actor-networks risk degenerating into endless chains of association (six degrees of separation—we are all networked to one another). Other research perspectives such as social constructionism, social shaping of technology, social network theory, normalization process theory, and diffusion of innovations theory are held to be important alternatives to ANT approaches.

===From STS itself and organizational studies===
Key early criticism came from other members of the STS community, in particular the &quot;Epistemological Chicken&quot; debate between Collins and Yearley with responses from Latour and Callon as well as Woolgar. In an article in &quot;Science as Practice and Culture&quot;, sociologist Harry Collins and his co-writer Steven Yearley argue that the ANT approach is a step backwards towards the positivist and realist positions held by early theory of science. Collins and Yearley accused ANTs approach of collapsing into an endless relativist regress.

Whittle and organization studies professor André Spicer note that &quot;ANT has also sought to move beyond deterministic models that trace organizational phenomena back to powerful individuals, social structures, hegemonic discourses or technological effects. Rather, ANT prefers to seek out complex patterns of causality rooted in connections between actors.&quot; They argue that ANT&#x27;s ontological realism makes it &quot;less well equipped for pursuing a critical account of organizations—that is, one which recognises the unfolding nature of reality, considers the limits of knowledge and seeks to challenge structures of domination.&quot; This implies that ANT does not account for pre-existing structures, such as power, but rather sees these structures as emerging from the actions of actors within the network and their ability to align in pursuit of their interests. Accordingly, ANT can be seen as an attempt to re-introduce Whig history into science and technology studies; like the myth of the heroic inventor, ANT can be seen as an attempt to explain successful innovators by saying only that they were successful. Likewise, for organization studies, Whittle and Spicer assert that ANT is, &quot;ill-suited to the task of developing political alternatives to the imaginaries of market managerialism.&quot;

===Human agency===

Actor–network theory insists on the capacity of nonhumans to be actors or participants in networks and systems. Critics including figures such as Langdon Winner maintain that such properties as intentionality fundamentally distinguish humans from animals or from &quot;things&quot; (see Activity Theory). ANT scholars  [] respond with the following arguments:

* They do not attribute intentionality and similar properties to nonhumans.
* Their conception of agency does not presuppose intentionality.
* They locate agency neither in human &quot;subjects&quot; nor in nonhuman &quot;objects&quot;, but in heterogeneous associations of humans and nonhumans.

ANT has been criticized as amoral. Wiebe Bijker has responded to this criticism by stating that the amorality of ANT is not a necessity. Moral and political positions are possible, but one must first describe the network before taking up such positions. This position has been further explored by Stuart Shapiro who contrasts ANT with the history of ecology, and argues that research decisions are moral rather than methodological, but this moral dimension has been sidelined.

===Misnaming===
In a workshop called &quot;On Recalling ANT&quot;, Latour &quot;himself&quot; stated that there are four things wrong with actor-network theory: &quot;actor&quot;, &quot;network&quot;, &quot;theory&quot; and the hyphen. In a later book, however, Latour reversed himself, accepting the wide use of the term, &quot;&quot;including&quot; the hyphen.&quot; He further remarked how he had been helpfully reminded that the ANT acronym &quot;was perfectly fit for a blind, myopic, workaholic, trail-sniffing, and collective traveler&quot;—qualitative hallmarks of actor-network epistemology.

<doc id="505097" wikidata="Q905549" url="?curid=505097" title="Royal Society of Chemistry">
<text>The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) is a learned society and professional association in the United Kingdom with the goal of &quot;advancing the chemical sciences&quot;. It was formed in 1980 from the amalgamation of the Chemical Society, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Faraday Society, and the Society for Analytical Chemistry with a new Royal Charter and the dual role of learned society and professional body. At its inception, the Society had a combined membership of 49,000 in the world. 

The headquarters of the Society are at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. It also has offices in Thomas Graham House in Cambridge (named after Thomas Graham, the first president of the Chemical Society) where &quot;RSC Publishing&quot; is based. The Society has offices in the United States, on the campuses of The University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University, at the University City Science Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in both Beijing and Shanghai, China and in Bangalore, India.

The organisation carries out research, publishes journals, books and databases, as well as hosting conferences, seminars and workshops. It is the professional body for chemistry in the UK, with the ability to award the status of Chartered Chemist (CChem) and, through the Science Council the awards of Chartered Scientist (CSci), Registered Scientist (RSci) and Registered Science Technician (RScTech) to suitably qualified candidates.

The designation FRSC is given to a group of elected Fellows of the society who have made major contributions to chemistry and other interface disciplines such as biological chemistry. Prior to 2006, the names of Fellows were published each year in &quot;The Times&quot; (London). Honorary Fellowship of the Society (&quot;HonFRSC&quot;) is awarded for distinguished service in the field of chemistry.

== President ==

The president is elected biennially and wears a badge in the form of a spoked wheel, with the standing figure of Joseph Priestley depicted in enamel, mainly in red and blue, on a hexagonal medallion in the centre. The rim of the wheel is gold, and the twelve spokes are of non-tarnishable metals. The current president is Gillian Reid (2022–2024). Past presidents of the society have been:
==Coat of arms==
The RSC has its own coat of arms. Two forms exist: the full coat of arms has lion and unicorn bearers, and the Latin motto &quot;&quot; (For the sake of knowledge and for the benefit of mankind). The smaller version is similar to the Royal Institute of Chemistry&#x27;s arms.

== Membership categories and post-nominals ==
The following are membership categories with post-nominals (designatory letters):
*&quot;Affiliate Member&quot;: (no post-nominal) The category for students and those involved in chemical science who do not meet the requirements for the following grades.
*&quot;AMRSC&quot;: &quot;Associate Member of the Royal Society of Chemistry&quot; The entry level for RSC membership, AMRSC is awarded to graduates (or equivalent) in the chemical sciences.
*&quot;MRSC&quot;: &quot;Member of the Royal Society of Chemistry&quot; Awarded to graduates (or equivalent) with at least 3 years&#x27; experience, who have acquired key skills through professional activity
*&quot;FRSC&quot;: &quot;Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry&quot; is awarded to those who have made an outstanding contribution to the chemical sciences (see :Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Chemistry).
**&quot;HonFRSC&quot;: &quot;Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry&quot; is awarded to any person distinguished in the science or profession of chemistry.
**Note: in 1904 eighteen women chemists petitioned to be made Fellow
*&quot;CChem&quot;: &quot;Chartered Chemist&quot; The award of CChem is considered separately from admission to a category of RSC membership. Candidates need to be MRSC or FRSC and demonstrate development of specific professional attributes and be in a job which requires their chemical knowledge and skills.
*&quot;CSci&quot;: &quot;Chartered Scientist&quot; The RSC is a licensed by the Science Council for the registration of Chartered Scientists.
*&quot;EurChem&quot;: &quot;European Chemist&quot; The RSC is a member of the European Communities Chemistry Council (ECCC), and can award this designation to Chartered Chemists.
*&quot;MChemA&quot;: &quot;Mastership in Chemical Analysis&quot; The RSC awards this postgraduate qualification which is the UK statutory qualification for practice as a Public Analyst. It requires candidates to submit a portfolio of suitable experience and to take theory papers and a one-day laboratory practical examination.

=== Graduate of the Royal Society of Chemistry ===
The qualification &quot;GRSC&quot; (Graduate of the Royal Society of Chemistry) was awarded from 1981 to 1995 for completion of college courses equivalent to an honours chemistry degree and validated by the RSC.

== Divisions and sections ==
The society is organised around nine divisions, based on subject areas, and local sections. There are thirty-five local sections covering the United Kingdom and Ireland. Divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas.

* &quot;Analytical Division&quot; for analytical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the &quot;Society for Analytical Chemistry&quot;; 12 Subject Groups.
* &quot;Dalton Division&quot;, named after John Dalton, for inorganic chemistry; 6 Subject Groups.
* &quot;Education Division&quot; for chemical education; 4 Subject Groups.
* &quot;Faraday Division&quot;, named after Michael Faraday, for physical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the &quot;Faraday Society&quot;; 14 Subject Groups.
* &quot;Organic Division&quot; for organic chemistry; 6 Subject Groups.
* &quot;Chemical Biology Interface Division&quot;; 2 Subject Groups.
* &quot;Environment, Sustainability and Energy Division&quot;; 3 Subject Groups.
* &quot;Materials Chemistry Division&quot;; 4 Subject Groups.
* &quot;Industry and Technology Division&quot;; 13 Subject Groups.

== Publications ==


The society is a not-for-profit publisher: surplus made by its publishing business is invested to support its aim of advancing the chemical sciences. Subscriptions to the journals are available individually, or &quot;all-in&quot;, under a provision called &quot;RSC Gold&quot;. In addition to scientific journals, including its flagship journals &quot;Chemical Communications&quot;, &quot;Chemical Science&quot; and &quot;Chemical Society Reviews&quot;, the society publishes:

* &quot;Education in Chemistry&quot; for teachers.
* A free online journal for chemistry educators, &quot;Chemistry Education Research and Practice&quot;.
* A general chemistry magazine &quot;Chemistry World&quot;, sent monthly to all members of the Society throughout the world. It was first published in January 2004, replacing &quot;Chemistry in Britain&quot;, which was first published in 1965. Its contents include news, articles of a general chemical nature, such as the history of chemistry and technological developments, book reviews and letters from readers. Its ISSN is 1473-7604.
* Professional reference books across the chemical sciences.
* Books for students, including the &quot;Tutorial Chemistry Texts&quot; series of 23 books, edited by E. W. Abel, and the 8 books in the &quot;Molecular World&quot; series, whose coordinating editor is L. E. Smart.
* Books on the history of chemistry, such as a history of the Faraday Society.

==Resources==
The Interactive Lab Primer is a site developed to provide tips to a variety of chemical experimentation skills. The site covers basic lab safety tips, demonstrates primary lab techniques, introduces a couple common lab apparatus in lab, and provides other references. The society&#x27;s ChemSpider is a database of chemicals and chemical properties. The society operates a blue plaque scheme, &quot;Landmarks of Chemistry&quot;, erecting plaques at places associated with notable chemical events or people.

== Burlington House ==
The London offices of the Society are in Burlington House, Piccadilly. Events are hosted here for the public, RSC member groups and external organisations including regular lectures on the chemical sciences. The free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music. The events have attracted notable science writers such as Philip Ball, Antony John Williams, and John Emsley to give public lectures. The society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects, including online access for members, housed at the Chemistry Centre at Burlington House. It is part of the Chemistry Centre and is a resource for RSC members.

=== History ===
The Royal Society of Chemistry has been resident at Burlington House since 1857 (at which time it was known as the Chemical Society) – at the heart of which is the RSC&#x27;s Library and Information Centre which itself dates back to 1842. Over the years, the library for the RSC has received many gifts from notable fellows including Michael Faraday. The library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the World Wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available.

==Benevolent fund==

The Chemists&#x27; Community Fund, the working name of the Royal Society of Chemistry&#x27;s Benevolent Fund, supports the members and their families during difficult times, through advice and guidance, financial and volunteer support. It dates back to 1920 when the Institute of Chemistry (later the Royal Institute of Chemistry) established it as a memorial to its members who died in the First World War. It had an aim &quot;to help necessitous persons who are, or have been, Fellows or Associates of the Institute, their wives or children, and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased Fellows and Associates&quot; through voluntary contributions from members. The Fund&#x27;s ethos of &quot;members helping members&quot; stems from the Institute of Chemistry&#x27;s Council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed.

In 1960, the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system, where members were asked to visit applicants, beneficiaries, elderly and housebound members in their area. Each local section was also appointed a fund representative. A major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003–2004, forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years. It underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach to include the prevention of poverty and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to Royal Society of Chemistry members and their families. The Benevolent Fund Grants Committee, formed of volunteer members of the Royal Society of Chemistry, oversees the fund and meets every three months.

== Prizes and awards ==
The RSC awards a variety of prizes and awards each year that include awards for excellence in any area of chemistry, in specialist areas or for achievement at particular stages of a chemist&#x27;s career. Medals are awarded centrally by the RSC and by the divisions of the organisation. There are also awards that are administered by RSC interest groups. The centrally awarded medals include the Harrison–Meldola Memorial Prizes which are awarded to a British chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry and the Corday–Morgan medals which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry (including computer simulation). The Tilden Prize, previously known as the Tilden Lecture, consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry.

Previous winners of the Harrison–Meldola Prize (known as the Meldola Medal and Prize prior to its merger in 2008 with the Edward Harrison prize) include Christopher Kelk Ingold (1921, 1922), Cyril Norman Hinshelwood (1923), R.H. Stokes (1946), D.H. Williams (1966), and J. Evans (1978). Corday–Morgan medal recipients include Derek Barton (1949), Ronald Sydney Nyholm (1950), Frederick Sanger (1951), John Cornforth (1953), Rex Richards (1954), and George Porter (1955). The Faraday Division annually awards the Marlow Award for contributions to physical chemistry or chemical physics by members of the Faraday Division under the age of 32. Recent recipients include Andrew Orr-Ewing, (1999), Jonathan A. Jones, (2000), Helen Fielding (2001), Jonathan Essex (2002), Daren Caruana (2003), Jonathan Reid (2004), Julie Macpherson (2005), Fred Manby (2006), and Alessandro Troisi (2007).

== Twitter Conference ==

The RSC operates an annual Twitter conference. The event is held entirely online over 24 hours. The aim of its unique format is to remove the environmental and financial costs of attending a traditional scientific conference, and help researchers share their work and network across disciplines, wherever they are in the world.

<text>The South African 2nd Infantry Division was an infantry division of the army of the Union of South Africa during World War II. The division was formed on 23 October 1940 and served in the Western Desert Campaign and was captured (save for one brigade) by German and Italian forces at Tobruk on 21 June 1942. The remaining brigade was re-allocated to the South African 1st Infantry Division.

==History==
The division was formed on 23 October 1940 with its divisional HQ at Voortrekkerhoogte, South Africa. On 21 June 1942 two complete infantry brigades of the division as well as most of the supporting units were captured at the fall of Tobruk.

===Bardia and the Western Desert===
The division capture of Bardia was part of the Libyan campaign against Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps from November 1941 to January 1942. They defeated a numerically superior Axis force in a strongly fortified position with a combined infantry and tank force.

<text>Thomas Robinson () was an English Renaissance composer and music teacher, who flourished around 1600. He taught and wrote music for lute, cittern, orpharion, bandora, viol, and voice.

==Biography==
Very little is known about Robinson&#x27;s life, but it is possible to draw conclusions from the dedicatory pages of his works. He and his father were in service of the Cecil family: Robinson&#x27;s father worked for the 1st Earl of Salisbury, Robert Cecil, and Robinson was in the service of the 1st Earl of Exeter, Thomas Cecil, who was Robert Cecil&#x27;s brother. The Cecil family fostered several artists in these days, amongst others William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons.

It was before 1589 that Robinson became Princess Anne&#x27;s (1574–1619) and Queen Sophie&#x27;s (1557–1631) private music teacher at Elsinore, Denmark. Princess Anne was the daughter of the King of Denmark, Frederick II (1559–1588). It is presumed that Robinson must have been in his twenties then, so that his birth can be dated back to around 1560.

The Court of Denmark, like other courts, employed many well-recognized musicians from Denmark and other countries, like England, France, Germany and the Netherlands. It is known that John Dowland – the most famous Renaissance lutenist nowadays – worked as a court lutenist in Denmark from 1598 to 1606. Besides Robinson&#x27;s own mention of his employment there, no official record of it exists.

In 1603, Robinson published his first book, &quot;Medulla Musicke&quot;, of which no copy survived. It was even suggested (Ward JM, see &quot;Literature&quot;), that it was never published at all, although Robinson seems to be referring to it in the first pages of his second book: &quot;.&quot; From: &quot;The Schoole of Musicke&quot;, 1603

Also in 1603, Robinson brought out his second book, &quot;The Schoole of Musicke&quot;, a tutor for lute and other instruments. It displaced John Alford&#x27;s book &quot;A Briefe and Easye Instruction&quot; from 1574 (an English translation of Adrian Le Roy&#x27;s &quot;Briefve et facile instruction pour apprendre la tabulature&quot;) as the most important lute tutor in England from then on.

In 1609 Robinson&#x27;s third book, &quot;New Citharen Lessons&quot;, was published. It was a cittern tutor for beginners and advanced learners.

Robinson&#x27;s works for the most part consist of his own compositions. But there are also arrangements of other pieces of music, some of which are still rather popular: for instance &quot;My Lord Willoughby&#x27;s Welcome Home&quot; (in: &quot;The Schoole of Musicke&quot;) or &quot;Can she excuse my wrongs?&quot; (in &quot;New Citharen Lessons&quot;) – both originally composed by John Dowland.

There is no further information available about Robinson&#x27;s life after 1609.

==Works==

===&quot;Medulla Musicke&quot;===
&quot;Medulla Musicke&quot; (The Stationer&#x27;s Company, London, 1603) was a music tutor now presumably lost. It is supposed to have included 40 canons on the then popular plainsong Miserere after arrangements by William Byrd and Alfonso Ferrabosco.

===&quot;The Schoole of Musicke&quot;===
&quot;The Schoole of Musicke,&quot; (&quot;Tho. Este&quot;, London, 1603), was a tutor for lute, bandora, orpharion, viol, and singing.

<text>Gregory LeNoir Allman (December 8, 1947 – May 27, 2017) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He was known for performing in the Allman Brothers Band. Allman grew up with an interest in rhythm and blues music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, jazz, and country. He wrote several of the band&#x27;s most popular songs, including &quot;Whipping Post&quot;, &quot;Melissa&quot;, and &quot;Midnight Rider&quot;. Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee, before relocating to Daytona Beach, Florida and then Macon, Georgia.

He and his brother Duane Allman formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;, but shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, and released &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, which became their most successful album, in 1973. Allman began a solo career with &quot;Laid Back&quot; the same year. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star Cher. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot; in 1987, and his seventh solo album, &quot;Low Country Blues&quot; (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir &quot;My Cross to Bear&quot; (2012). His final album, &quot;Southern Blood&quot;, was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.

Allman performed with a Hammond organ and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a Southern rock pioneer and received numerous awards, including one Grammy Award; he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. His distinctive voice placed him 70th in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;.

== Early life ==

Gregory LeNoir Allman was born on December 8, 1947, at Saint Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee to Geraldine Robbins Allman (1917–2015) and Willis Turner Allman (1918–1949). The couple had met during World War II in Raleigh, North Carolina when Allman was on leave from the U.S. Army, and were later married. Their first child, Duane Allman, was born in Nashville in November 20,1946. On December 26, 1949, Willis offered a ride to a hitchhiker, Michael Robert &quot;Buddy&quot; Green (1923-2024), an Army veteran, who shot and killed him during an armed robbery in Norfolk, Virginia. Green was captured, convicted, sentenced and paroled in 1972. Geraldine moved to Nashville with her two sons and never remarried. Lacking money to support her children, she enrolled in college to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)—state laws at the time, according to her son, required students to live on-campus.

As a result, Gregg and his older brother were sent to Castle Heights Military Academy in nearby Lebanon. A young Gregg interpreted these actions as evidence of his mother&#x27;s dislike for him, though he later came to understand the reality: &quot;She was actually sacrificing everything she possibly could—she was working around the clock, getting by just by a hair, so as to not send us to an orphanage, which would have been a living hell.&quot; While his brother adapted to his surroundings with a defiant attitude, Allman felt largely depressed at the school. With little to do, he studied often and developed an interest in medicine—had he not gone into music, he hoped to become a dentist. He was rarely hazed at Castle Heights as his brother protected him, but often suffered beatings from instructors when he received poor grades. The brothers returned to Nashville upon their mother&#x27;s graduation, and moved to Daytona Beach, Florida in 1959. Allman would later recall two separate events in his life that led to his interest in music. In 1960, the two brothers attended a concert in Nashville with Jackie Wilson headlining alongside Otis Redding, B.B. King, and Patti LaBelle. Allman was also exposed to music through Jimmy Banes, an intellectually disabled neighbor of his grandmother in Nashville, who introduced him to the guitar.

Gregg worked as a paper boy to afford a Silvertone guitar, which he purchased at a Sears when he saved up enough funds. Like his brother, he was left-handed, but played the guitar right-handed. He and his brother often fought to play the instrument, though there was &quot;no question that music brought&quot; the two together. In Daytona, they joined a YMCA group called the Y Teens, their first experience performing music with others. He and Duane returned to Castle Heights in their teen years, where they formed a band, the Misfits. Despite this, he still felt &quot;lonesome and out of place&quot;, and quit the academy. He returned to Daytona Beach and pursued music further, and the duo formed another band, the Shufflers, in 1963. He attended high school at Seabreeze High School, where he graduated in 1965. However, he grew undisciplined in his studies as his interests diverged: &quot;Between the women and the music, school wasn&#x27;t a priority anymore.&quot;

==Musical beginnings==
=== First bands (1960–1968) ===
The two Allman brothers began meeting various musicians in the Daytona Beach area. They met a man named Floyd Miles, and they began to jam with his band, the Houserockers. &quot;I would just sit there and study Floyd ... I studied how he phrased his songs, how he got the words out, and how the other guys sang along with him&quot;, Gregg would later recall. They later formed their first &quot;real&quot; band, the Escorts, which performed a mix of top 40 and R&amp;B music at clubs around town. Duane, who took the lead vocal role on early demos, encouraged his younger brother to sing instead. He and Duane often spent all of their money on records, as they attempted to learn songs from them. The group performed constantly as music became their entire focus; Gregg missed his high school graduation because he was performing that evening. In his autobiography, Gregg recalls listening to Nashville R&amp;B station WLAC at night and discovering artists such as Muddy Waters, who later became central to his musical evolution. He avoided being drafted into the Vietnam War by intentionally shooting himself in the foot.

The Escorts evolved into the Allman Joys, the brothers&#x27; first successful band. After a successful summer run locally, they hit the road in fall 1965 for a series of performances throughout the Southeast; their first show outside Daytona was at the Stork Club in Mobile, Alabama, where they were booked for 22 weeks straight. Afterwards, they were booked at the Sahara Club in nearby Pensacola, Florida, for several weeks. Allman later regarded Pensacola as &quot;a real turning point in my life&quot;, as it was where he learned how to capture audiences and about stage presence. He also received his first Vox keyboard there, and learned how to play it over the ensuing tour. By the following summer, they were able to book time at a studio in Nashville, where they recorded several songs, aided by a plethora of drugs. These recordings were later released as &quot;Early Allman&quot; in 1973, to Allman&#x27;s dismay. He soon grew tired of performing covers and began writing original compositions. They settled in St. Louis, Missouri for a time, where in the spring of 1967 they began performing alongside Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby, among others, under various names. They considered disbanding, but Bill McEuen, manager of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, convinced the band to relocate to Los Angeles, giving them the funds to do so.

He arranged a recording contract with Liberty Records in June 1967, and they began to record an album under the new name the Hour Glass, suggested by their producer, Dallas Smith. Recording was a difficult experience; &quot;the music had no life to it—it was poppy, preprogrammed shit&quot;, Allman felt. Though they considered themselves sellouts, they needed money to live. At concerts, they declined to play anything off their debut album, released that October, instead opting to play the blues. Such gigs were sparse, however, as Liberty only allowed one performance per month. After some personnel changes, they recorded their second album, &quot;Power of Love&quot;, released in March 1968. It contained more original songs by Allman, though they still felt constricted by its process. The band broke up when Duane explicitly told off executives at Liberty. They threatened to freeze the band, so they would be unable to record for any other label for seven years. Allman stayed behind to appease the label, giving them the rights to a solo album. The rest of the band mocked Allman, viewing him as too scared to leave and return to the South. Meanwhile, Duane began doing session work at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he began putting together a new band. He phoned his brother with the proposition of joining the new band—which would have two guitarists and two drummers. With his deal at Liberty fulfilled, he drove to Jacksonville, Florida, in March 1969 to jam with the new band. He called the birth of the group &quot;one of the finer days in my life ... I was starting to feel like I belonged to something again.&quot;

== The Allman Brothers Band and mainstream success ==
=== Formation, touring, and Duane&#x27;s death (1969–1971) ===
The Allman Brothers Band moved to Macon, Georgia, and forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming psychedelic drugs, and hanging out in Rose Hill Cemetery, where they would write songs and more—&quot;I&#x27;d be lying if I said I didn&#x27;t have my way with a lady or two down there&quot;, said Allman. In addition to Gregg, the band included Duane, Dickey Betts on guitar, Berry Oakley on bass, and Jaimoe and Butch Trucks on drums. The group remade blues numbers like &quot;Trouble No More&quot; and &quot;One Way Out&quot;, in addition to improvising jams. Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band&#x27;s main songwriter, composing songs such as &quot;Whipping Post&quot; and &quot;Midnight Rider&quot;. The group&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in November 1969 through Atco and Capricorn Records, but suffered from poor sales. The band played continuously in 1970, performing over 300 dates on the road, which contributed to a larger following. Their second record, &quot;Idlewild South&quot;, was issued in September 1970, and also received a muted commercial response.
Their fortunes began to change over the course of 1971, where the band&#x27;s average earnings doubled. &quot;We realized that the audience was a big part of what we did, which couldn&#x27;t be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album&quot;, said Gregg. &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;, recorded at the Fillmore East in New York City, was released in July 1971. &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; peaked at number thirteen on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough. Although suddenly very wealthy and successful, much of the band and its entourage now struggled with addiction to numerous drugs; they all agreed to quit heroin, but cocaine remained a problem. His last conversation with Duane was an argument over cocaine: Gregg took some of his brother&#x27;s supply, and later denied it when accused. In his memoir, &quot;My Cross to Bear&quot;, Gregg wrote: &quot;I have thought of that lie every day of my life ... told him that lie, and he told me that he was sorry and that he loved me.&quot;

Duane was killed in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, in Macon. At his funeral, Gregg performed &quot;Melissa&quot;, which was his brother&#x27;s favorite song. &quot;I tried to play and I tried to sing, but I didn&#x27;t do too much writing. In the days and weeks that followed, ... I wondered if I&#x27;d ever find the passion, the energy, the love of making music&quot;, he remembered. As the band took some time apart to process their loss, &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; became a major success domestically. &quot;What we had been trying to do for all those years finally happened, and he was gone,&quot; Gregg remembered. He later expanded upon his brother&#x27;s passing in his memoir:

=== Mainstream success and fame (1972–1976) ===
After Duane&#x27;s death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road. They completed their third studio album, &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;, that winter, which raised each member&#x27;s spirits: &quot;The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;&quot;, said Allman. &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; was released the following February, and it became the band&#x27;s second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. &quot;We&#x27;d been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever&quot;, Allman recalled. The band purchased 432 acres of land in Juliette, Georgia, which became a group hangout. Berry Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from the death of his friend, and in November 1972 he too was killed in a motorcycle crash. &quot;Upset as I was, I kind of breathed a sigh of relief, because Berry&#x27;s pain was finally over&quot;, Allman said.

The band unanimously decided to carry on, and enlisted Lamar Williams on bass and Chuck Leavell on piano. The band began recording &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, their follow-up album, and Betts became the group&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader during the recording process. Meanwhile, after some internal disagreements, Allman began recording a solo album, which he titled &quot;Laid Back&quot;. The sessions for both albums often overlapped and its creation caused tension within the rest of the band. Both albums were released in late 1973, with &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; cementing the Allman Brothers&#x27; place among the biggest rock bands of the 1970s. &quot;Everything that we&#x27;d done before—the touring, the recording—culminated in that one album&quot;, Allman recalled. &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Man&quot;, Betts&#x27; country-infused number, rose to number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and gave the band their biggest hit. The group returned to touring, and played arenas and stadiums almost solely. Privately, the group was dealing with miscommunication and spiraling drug problems. In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting the Starship, a customized Boeing 720B used by Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. &quot;When [we] got that goddamn plane, it was the beginning of the end&quot;, said Allman.

Band member relationships became increasingly frustrated, amplified by heavy drug and alcohol abuse. In January 1975, Allman began a relationship with pop star Cher—which made him more &quot;famous for being famous than for his music&quot;, according to biographer Alan Paul. The sessions that produced 1975&#x27;s &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band, were disjointed and inconsistent. Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor; the band later remarked that they were &quot;embarrassed&quot; by the album. Though their relationships were fraying, the Allman Brothers Band went on tour for some of the biggest crowds of their career. Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate Jimmy Carter as the only real &quot;high point&quot; in an otherwise &quot;rough, rough tour&quot;. The &quot;breaking point&quot; came when Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring, who was arrested and soon convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Bandmates considered Allman a &quot;snitch&quot;, and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection. Herring received a 75-year prison sentence, but he only served eighteen months. The band refused to communicate with Allman after the ordeal and finally broke up. Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in Sea Level, Betts formed Great Southern, and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band.

== Mid-career and struggles ==
=== Marriages, breakups, and music (1975–1981) ===

Allman married Cher in June 1975, and the two lived in Hollywood during their years together as tabloid favorites. Their marriage produced one son, Elijah Blue Allman, who was born in July 1976. He recorded his second solo album, &quot;Playin&#x27; Up a Storm&quot;, with the Gregg Allman Band, and it was released in May 1977. He also worked on a collaborative album with Cher titled &quot;Two the Hard Way&quot;, which, upon its release, was a massive failure. The couple went to Europe to tour in support of both albums, though the crowd reception was mixed. With a combination of Allman Brothers fans and Cher fans, fights often broke out in venues, which led Cher to cancel the tour. Turmoil began to overwhelm their relationship, and the two divorced in 1978. Allman returned to Daytona Beach to stay with his mother, spending the majority of his time partying, chasing women, and touring with the Nighthawks, a blues band.

The Allman Brothers Band reunited in 1978. Allman remembered that each member had his own reasons for rejoining, though he surmised it was a combination of displeasure with how things ended, missing each other, and a need for money. The band&#x27;s reunion album, &quot;Enlightened Rogues&quot;, was released in February 1979 and was a mild commercial success. Betts&#x27;s lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group, and led the band to sign with Arista, who pushed the band to &quot;modernize&quot; their sound. Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly for Betts and Allman. The band again grew apart, replacing Jaimoe with new guitarist Dan Toler&#x27;s brother Frankie. The band considered their post-reunion albums—&quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1980) and &quot;Brothers of the Road&quot; (1981)—&quot;embarrassing&quot;, and subsequently broke up in 1982. &quot;It was like a whole different band made those records ... In truth, though, I was just too drunk most of the time to care one way or the other&quot;, Allman would recall.

=== Downtime, a surprise hit, and another reformation (1982–1990) ===
Allman spent much of the 1980s adrift and living in Sarasota, Florida with friends. David &quot;Rook&quot; Goldflies, Allman&#x27;s bass player, managed to bring him to Kenny Veenstra&#x27;s &quot;Progressive Music Studios&quot;, up in Tampa. There he recorded vocals on a number of Goldflies&#x27; songs. Though Allman had never heard the cuts, he sang them perfectly... one line at a time... (the producer promising beer and pizza &quot;after he finished the vocals).&quot; His alcohol abuse was at one of its worst points, with Allman consuming &quot;a minimum of a fifth of vodka a day.&quot; He felt the local police pursued him heavily; during this time, he was arrested and charged with a DUI. While he did not consider himself &quot;washed up&quot;, he noted in his autobiography that he kept a &quot;fear of everybody forgetting about you.&quot; Southern rock had faded from view and electronic music formed much of the pop music of the decade. &quot;There was hardly anybody playing live music, and those who did were doing it for not much money, in front of some die-hard old hippies in real small clubs&quot;, he later recalled. Nevertheless, he reformed the Gregg Allman Band and toured nationwide. At one point, he attempted to reconnect with his children, though, according to him, &quot;it just wasn&#x27;t a good situation&quot;.

By 1986, having grown tired of financial instability, Allman approached Betts for a co-headlining tour, a sort-of Allman Brothers reunion. After recording several demos, Allman was offered a recording contract by Epic Records. His third solo release, &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot; (1987), sold well; its title track became a surprise hit on radio. Allman released another solo album the following year, &quot;Just Before the Bullets Fly&quot;, though it did not sell as well as its predecessor. In the late 1980s, he moved to Los Angeles. He married Danielle Galiana in what he dubbed midlife crisis. The marriage began with Allman overdosing—&quot;so [it] started off with a bang&quot;, he said. He dabbled in acting starting in 1989, taking several small parts. His largest (and final) role was criminal Will Gaines in the 1991 crime drama &quot;Rush&quot;. Allman greatly enjoyed the experience: &quot;It was a different facet of the entertainment industry, and I wanted to see how those people worked together.&quot; The Allman Brothers Band celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1989, and the band reunited once more for a summer tour, with Jaimoe again on drums. They featured guitarist Warren Haynes and pianist Johnny Neel, both from the Dickey Betts Band, and bassist Allen Woody. The band returned to the studio with longtime producer Tom Dowd for 1990&#x27;s &quot;Seven Turns&quot;, which was considered a return to form. &quot;Good Clean Fun&quot; and &quot;Seven Turns&quot; each became big hits on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The addition of Haynes and Woody had &quot;reenergized&quot; the ensemble.

=== Reforming the band and breaking addictions (1991–2000) ===
The newly reformed Allman Brothers began touring heavily, which helped build a new fan base: &quot;We had to build a fan base all over again, but as word of mouth spread about how good the music was, more and more people took notice. It felt great, man, and that really helped the music&quot;, Allman recalled. Neel left the group and the band added percussionist Marc Quiñones, formerly of Spyro Gyra, the following year. They recorded two more studio albums—&quot;Shades of Two Worlds&quot; (1992) and &quot;Where It All Begins&quot;. In 1993 his youngest daughter Layla Brooklyn Allman was born while Gregg was living in Novato, California. When his relationship with Shelby Blackburn ended, Layla and Shelby moved back to Los Angeles. Allman&#x27;s older daughter, Island, came to live with him in Novato, and despite early struggles, they eventually grew very close. &quot;Island is the love of my life, she really is&quot;, he would later write. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could barely make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. He hired two in-home nurses that switched twelve-hour shifts to help him through the process. He was immensely happy to finally quit alcohol, writing later in his autobiography: &quot;Did I get any positive anything out of all that? And you&#x27;ve got to admit to yourself, no, I didn&#x27;t. You can see what happened and that by the grace of God, you finally quit before it killed you.&quot;

For much of the 1990s, Allman lived in Marin County, California, spending his free time with close friends and riding his motorcycle. He recorded a fifth solo album, &quot;Searching for Simplicity&quot;, which was quietly released on 550 Music in 1997. The album&#x27;s title reflected his search &quot;for a more simple life&quot; following his rehabilitation from drugs and alcohol. Despite positive developments in his personal life, relationships began declining in the band yet again. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov&#x27;t Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent. The group recruited Oteil Burbridge of the Aquarium Rescue Unit to replace Woody on bass, and Jack Pearson on guitar. Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts. &quot;It had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing&quot;, said Allman. Pearson, struggling with tinnitus, left as a result. Butch Trucks phoned his nephew, Derek Trucks, to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour. Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him. All involved contended that the break was temporary, but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group, which led to a permanent divorce. That August, Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York, which hit Allman particularly hard. In 2001, Haynes rejoined the band, setting the stage for over a decade of stability within the group.

== Later life ==
=== Touring and health problems (2000–2011) ===

Allman moved to Richmond Hill, Georgia, in 2000, purchasing five acres on the Belfast River. The last incarnation of the Allman Brothers Band was well-regarded among fans and the general public, and remained stable and productive. The band released its final studio album, &quot;Hittin&#x27; the Note&quot; (2003), to critical acclaim. Allman co-wrote many songs on the record with Haynes, and regarded it as his favorite album by the group since their earliest days. The band continued to tour throughout the 2000s, remaining a top touring act, regularly attracting more than 20,000 fans. The decade closed with a successful fortieth anniversary celebration at the Beacon Theatre, where the band would hold residencies most years during their reunion. In 2014, the Allman Brothers Band performed their final concerts, as Haynes and Derek Trucks desired to depart the group.

Allman struggled with health problems during the last years of his life. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 2007, which he attributed to a dirty tattoo needle. By the next year, three tumors were discovered within his liver. He went on a waiting list and after five months, he underwent a successful liver transplant in 2010.

In 2011, Allman went public about his battle with hepatitis C. He headlined Merck and the American Liver Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Tune In to Hep C Campaign&quot; to raise awareness and urge baby boomers to get tested and treated. As part of Tune In to Hep C, The Allman Brothers Band headlined a hepatitis C fundraiser and awareness concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York. The concert raised $250,000 to benefit the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable and the American Liver Foundation for education and awareness efforts. The National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable in October 2017 created the Gregg Allman Hepatitis C Leadership Award – an annual award to posthumously honor Allman and others who work on behalf of people living with hepatitis C. Michael Lehman, Allman&#x27;s longtime manager, accepted the award on his behalf.

Allman&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Low Country Blues&quot;, was produced by T-Bone Burnett. Upon its release in January 2011, it represented Allman&#x27;s highest-ever chart peak in the U.S., debuting at number five. He promoted the album heavily in Europe, until he had to cancel the rest of the trip due to an upper respiratory infection. This led to lung surgery later in 2011, and rehab in 2012 for addiction following his treatments. That year, Allman released his memoir, &quot;My Cross to Bear&quot;, which was 30 years in the making. In 2014, a tribute concert was held celebrating his career; it was later released as &quot;All My Friends: Celebrating the Songs &amp; Voice of Gregg Allman&quot;.

=== Final years and death (2012–2017) ===

After the dissolution of the Allman Brothers, Allman kept busy performing music with his solo band, releasing the live album &quot;Gregg Allman Live: Back to Macon, GA&quot; in 2015. In 2016, he received an honorary doctorate from Mercer University in Macon, presented by former President Jimmy Carter. However, his health problems remained; he had atrial fibrillation, and though he kept it private, his liver cancer had returned. &quot;He kept it very private because he wanted to continue to play music until he couldn&#x27;t&quot;, his manager Michael Lehman said. He attempted to keep a light schedule at the advice of doctors, who warned that too many performances might amplify his conditions. His last concert took place in Atlanta at his own Laid Back Festival along with ZZ Top at Lakewood Amphitheatre on October 29, 2016 (the 45th anniversary of his brother&#x27;s death), and he continued to cancel concerts citing &quot;serious health issues&quot;. He denied reports that he had entered hospice care, but was resting at home on doctor&#x27;s orders.

Allman died at his home in Richmond Hill, Georgia, on May 27, 2017, due to complications from liver cancer at the age of 69. His funeral took place at Snow&#x27;s Memorial Chapel in Macon on June 3, and was attended by once-estranged bandmate Dickey Betts, his ex-wife Cher, and former President Carter, among others. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the mourners dressed casually in jeans per Allman&#x27;s request, and &quot;hundreds of fans, many wearing Allman Brothers shirts and listening to the band&#x27;s music, lined the route along the funeral procession.&quot; He was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, beside his brother Duane, and fellow band member Berry Oakley.

Before his death, Allman recorded his last album, &quot;Southern Blood&quot;, with producer Don Was at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The album was recorded with his then-current backing band. The album was released on September 8, 2017, and received critical acclaim.

In &quot;My Cross to Bear&quot;, Allman reflected on his life and career:

==Musical style and songwriting==

Allman&#x27;s style was rooted in rhythm and blues music. He characterized his work with the Allman Brothers Band as &quot;playing some blues with some jazz mixed in.&quot; He was introduced to blues music through musician and childhood friend Floyd Miles, who later toured with Allman as a part of his solo band. He also gave him advice on how to sing from his stomach, as opposed to his chest. Allman was inspired by &quot;Little Milton&quot; Campbell, who &quot;inspired me all my life to get my voice crisper, get my diaphragm harder, use less air, and just spit it out. He taught me to be absolutely sure of every note you hit, and to hit it solid.&quot; After his death, many outlets credited Allman as among the greatest white blues vocalists of his time. Many close to Allman disputed this, with son Devon Allman commenting, &quot;My dad didn&#x27;t see color. ... I know people mean well when they say the best white blues singer, but I say take white off of there, because he was just one of the best ever. He just channeled so much feeling.&quot; Jaimoe called the label &quot;straight bullshit. He&#x27;s a great blues singer. A great singer, period.&quot; An editorial published in &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot; questioned that while Allman could rightfully be considered a cultural appropriator, &quot;Is that not the nature of music, or art in general, that it borrows from different cultures to create something new?&quot; Likewise, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; tribute to Allman noted that &quot;Ray Charles took grief for making a country and western album, too.&quot;

As a songwriter, Allman wrote several famous songs, including &quot;Whipping Post&quot;, &quot;Melissa&quot;, and &quot;Midnight Rider&quot;, which he dubbed the &quot;song I&#x27;m most proud of in my career.&quot; He could be a very slow songwriter, writing only when inspiration struck. If the song was forced, he felt it could end up contrived. In &quot;My Cross to Bear&quot;, his 2012 memoir, he laid out his approach to songwriting: the first verse introduces a story, it is expounded upon in the second, and the third may serve as an epilogue. Allman credited singer-songwriter John D. Loudermilk, whom he first met while touring with the Allman Joys, as an influence on his writing. &quot;[He] taught me to let the song come to me, not to force it, not to put down a word just because it might rhyme or fit. He taught me to let the feeling come from your heart and go to your head.&quot; Allman received the Songwriter Award from the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in the last year of his life.

On October 28, 2021, Sony Music Publishing announced it had signed a global agreement with Gregg Allman&#x27;s estate to administer its catalog of songs. The deal covered many of Allman&#x27;s compositions from his time as a member of the Allman Brothers Band, as well as songs written throughout his solo career.

== Personal life ==
Allman was married seven times:
* He married Shelley Kay Jefts in 1971; they divorced the following year. They had a son, Devon.
* He married Janice Blair in 1973; they divorced in 1974. She is pictured on the sleeve of &quot;Laid Back&quot;.
* His most well-known relationship was with Cher, whom he married in 1975. They had a son, Elijah Blue, and divorced in 1978.
* He wed Julie Bindas in 1979; they had a daughter, Delilah Island, and divorced in 1981.
* He married Danielle Galiana in 1989; they divorced in 1994.
* His longest marriage was to Stacey Fountain, from 2001 to 2008—&quot;seven out-of-sight years,&quot; he remarked.
* In 2012, he announced his engagement to Shannon Williams, who was 40 years his junior. They were married in February 2017.

In &quot;My Cross to Bear&quot;, he wrote that &quot;Every woman I&#x27;ve ever had a relationship with has loved me for who they thought I was.&quot; At the time of its writing, he noted that he only spoke to two out of his then-six ex-wives, including Cher.

Allman had five children, three with various wives and two with other women he had relationships with:
* son Michael Allman was born on July 3, 1966. He was raised in Daytona Beach, Florida. From his relationship with go-go dancer Mary Lynn Sutton.
* son Devon Allman (born 1972), lead singer of Honeytribe and The Allman Betts Band, from his marriage to Shelley Kay Jefts;
* son Elijah Blue Allman (born 1976), lead singer of Deadsy, from his marriage to Cher;
* daughter Delilah Island Allman (born 1980) from his marriage to Julie Bindas; and
* daughter Layla Brooklyn Allman (born 1993), lead singer of Picture Me Broken, from a relationship with radio journalist Shelby Blackburn

Allman was averse to organized religion for many years, but claimed he always believed in a God. Following his health ailments in the latter stages of his life, he came around to his own form of Christianity, and began wearing a cross necklace. In his memoir, he stated: &quot;As long as you have spirituality, you&#x27;re never alone. It&#x27;s sort of like my mother said all those years ago: now I have my own kind of faith, just like other people. They take what they want of faith, and they leave the rest alone, and I do the same. That&#x27;s the way it should be.&quot; He credited his sixth wife, Stacey Fountain, with helping him increase his faith.

<doc id="505106" wikidata="Q216700" url="?curid=505106" title="Roger Glover">
<text>Roger David Glover (born 30 November 1945) is a Welsh bassist, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as a member of the hard rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow. As a member of Deep Purple, Glover was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2016.

==Early life==
Born near Brecon, Wales, Glover moved with his family to the South Kensington area of London at the age of nine. His family owned a pub. Around that time his interests started to shift towards rock music, and by the time he was thirteen Glover began playing guitar.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
He later moved to the North London district of Pinner, and while at Harrow County School for Boys he formed his first band, Madisons, with a group of friends; in time this merged with a rival band to become Episode Six, a band which later featured Glover&#x27;s future Deep Purple bandmate, vocalist Ian Gillan. The two left Episode Six in 1969 to join Deep Purple.

=== Deep Purple and solo ===
Glover spent four years (1969–1973) with Deep Purple, during which the band saw their most successful releases in the albums &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot;, &quot;Fireball&quot;, &quot;Machine Head&quot;, &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; and the live album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. 

Glover was a prominent songwriter for the band, most notably co-writing with the rest of the group, &quot;Highway Star&quot;.

He is credited with developing the title for the band&#x27;s iconic song &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, thus inspiring the song&#x27;s lyrics which were written by Ian Gillan. Glover says the title came to him when he awoke from a dream two days after the famous fire over Lake Geneva. While he liked the title, he was reluctant to have the band use it because he initially thought it sounded like a drug song. Glover also developed the guitar riff to &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m a Leo&quot;, stating, &quot;I wrote the riff to &#x27;Maybe I&#x27;m a Leo&#x27; after hearing John Lennon&#x27;s &#x27;How Do You Sleep?&#x27;.&quot;

Glover contributed bass on Jon Lord&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Gemini Suite&quot; (1971), and was the featured soloist in the bass movement. Glover departed Deep Purple, along with Gillan, after the band&#x27;s second tour of Japan in the summer of 1973.

In 1974 Glover released his first solo album, &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot;, which generated the single &quot;Love Is All&quot;, featuring lead vocals by Ronnie James Dio. The single did little in the UK, but became an unexpected number one hit song in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Australia. The song came with an animated music video starring a guitar-playing frog. In 1978 Glover&#x27;s second album followed: &quot;Elements&quot;. When Deep Purple reformed in April 1984, Glover returned to his old band where he has remained for the last four decades. He has since produced four of their albums.

Glover worked as a producer, producing albums for Elf, Rupert Hine, Nazareth, Hardin &amp; York, The Spencer Davis Group, Dan McCafferty, Ian Gillan Band, Strapps, Rory Gallagher, The Young &amp; Moody Band, Judas Priest, Eddie Hardin, Barbie Benton, David Coverdale, Grand Theft, Rainbow, Michael Schenker Group, Deep Purple, and Pretty Maids.

=== Painting and photography ===
On 22 October 2010 Roger Glover&#x27;s artwork exhibition called &quot;Happy Silence&quot; opened at the K-8 e.V. Galerie in Cologne. Previously Glover has let many of his pictures be auctioned in other galleries for charitable purposes, but this was the first large-scale presentation of his work. The proceeds were donated to three different charity organisations (KiK Krebsberatung in Köln, Gulliver Überlebensstation für Obdachlose, Ambulanter Kinderhospizdienst Köln).

== Gear ==

Roger Glover played Fender Precision, Fender Mustang and Rickenbacker 4001 basses during his early years with Deep Purple. In late 1970s, he used a Gibson Thunderbird. In the mid-1980s Roger used Peavey Foundation with a neck from Peavey Fury Bass. Since the mid-1990s, he has used Vigier Bass Guitars, SWR heads and cabinets, and Picato and Ernie Ball strings.

==Personal life==
Glover has been married twice and has three daughters. The eldest, musician Gillian Glover (born 1976), is from his first marriage. He currently lives in Switzerland with his partner and their two daughters.

<doc id="505110" wikidata="Q6710242" url="?curid=505110" title="Lysis buffer">
<text>A lysis buffer is a buffer solution used for the purpose of breaking open cells for use in molecular biology experiments that analyze the labile macromolecules of the cells (e.g. western blot for protein, or for DNA extraction). Most lysis buffers contain buffering salts (e.g. Tris-HCl) and ionic salts (e.g. NaCl) to regulate the pH and osmolarity of the lysate. Sometimes detergents (such as Triton X-100 or SDS) are added to break up membrane structures. For lysis buffers targeted at protein extraction, protease inhibitors are often included, and in difficult cases may be almost required. Lysis buffers can be used on both animal and plant tissue cells.

== Choosing a buffer ==
The primary purpose of lysis buffer is isolating the molecules of interest and keeping them in a stable environment. For proteins, for some experiments, the target proteins should be completely denatured, while in some other experiments the target protein should remain folded and functional. Different proteins also have different properties and are found in different cellular environments. Thus, it is essential to choose the best buffer based on the purpose and design of the experiments. The important factors to be considered are: pH, ionic strength, usage of detergent, protease inhibitors to prevent proteolytic processes. For example, detergent addition is necessary when lysing Gram-negative bacteria, but not for Gram-positive bacteria. It is common that a protease inhibitor is added to lysis buffer, along with other enzyme inhibitors of choice, such as a phosphatase inhibitor when studying proteins with phosphorylation.

== Components ==

=== Buffer ===
Buffer creates an environment for isolated proteins. Each buffer choice has a specific pH range, so the buffer should be chosen based on whether the experiment&#x27;s target protein is stable under a certain pH. Also, for buffers with similar pH ranges, it is important to consider whether the buffer is compatible with the experiment&#x27;s target protein. The table below contains several most commonly used buffers and their pH ranges.
=== Additives ===

==== Salts ====
Lysis buffer usually contains one or more salts. The function of salts in lysis buffer is to establish an ionic strength in the buffer solution. Some of the most commonly used salts are NaCl, KCl, and (NH4)2SO4. They are usually used with a concentration between 50 and 150 mM.
==== Detergent ====

Detergents are organic amphipathic (with hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head) surfactants. They are used to separate membrane proteins from membrane because the hydrophobic part of detergent can surround biological membranes and thus isolate membrane proteins from membranes. Although detergents are widely used and have similar functions, the physical and chemical properties of detergents of interest must be considered in light of the goals of an experiment.

Detergents are often categorized as nonionic, anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic, based on their hydrophilic head group feature.

Nonionic detergents like Triton X-100 and zwitterionic detergents like CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) are nondenaturing (will not disrupt protein functions). Ionic detergents like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic detergents like ethyl trimethyl ammonium bromide are denaturing (will disrupt protein functions). Detergents are a major ingredient that determines the lysis strength of a given lysis buffer.

==== Detergent-Free Cell Lysis Buffers ====
One common issue faced by many cell lysis buffers is the disruption of protein structures during the lysis process, partially caused by use of detergents. Detergents often prevent the restoration of native conditions necessary for proper protein folding.

For the longest time, after a detergent-based cell lysis, a buffer exchange and/or dialysis had to be performed to remove the detergent among other hindering compounds to restore native conditions.

To overcome this a solution has emerged in the form of a detergent-free cell lysis buffer. The GentleLys buffer employs copolymers instead of detergents, ensuring efficient cell lysis while maintaining the native environment crucial for the correct folding of cellular components, such as proteins.

==== Others ====
Other additives include metal ions, sugar like glucose, glycerol, metal chelators (e.g. EDTA), and reducing agents like dithiothreitol (DTT).

== Commonly used buffers ==

=== NP-40 lysis buffer ===
It may be the most widely used lysis buffer. The solubilizing agent is NP-40, which can be replaced by other detergents at different concentrations. Since NP-40 is a nonionic detergent, this lysis buffer has a milder effect than RIPA buffer. It can be used when protein functions are to be retained with minimal disruption.

Recipe:
* 150 mM NaCl
* 1.0% Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100
* 50 mM Tris-Cl
* Adjust pH to 7.4

=== RIPA (RadioImmunoPrecipitation Assay) lysis buffer ===
RIPA buffer is a commonly used lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation and general protein extraction from cells and tissues. The buffer can be stored without vanadate at 4 °C for up to 1 year. RIPA buffer releases proteins from cells as well as disrupts most weak interactions between proteins.

Recipe:
* 1% (w/w) Nonidet P-40 (NP-40)
* 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate
* 0.1% (w/v) SDS
* 0.15 M NaCl
* 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2
* 2 mM EDTA
* 50 mM sodium fluoride (NaF)
* 0.2 mM fresh sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4.2H2O, it has phosphatase inhibitor function because it mimics phosphate)
* 100 U/ml protease inhibitor, such as aprotinin

=== SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) lysis buffer ===
SDS is ionic denaturing detergent. Hot SDS buffer is often used when the proteins need to be completely solubilized and denatured.

Recipe:
* 0.5% (w/v) SDS
* 0.05 M Tris⋅Cl
* Adjust pH to 8.0
* Add 1 mM fresh dithiothreitol (DTT)

=== ACK (Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium) lysing buffer ===
ACK is used for lysis of red blood cells in biological samples where other cells such as white blood cells are of greater interest.

Recipe:
* 150 mM ammonium chloride
* 10 mM potassium bicarbonate
* 0.1 mM EDTA
* Adjust pH to 7.2-7.4

=== GentleLys (Gentle Lysis) ===
The GentleLys buffer employs synthetic nanodisc copolymers to gently disrupt the cell membrane, offering a milder alternative to conventional detergent-based lysis buffers. This gentle approach eliminates the need for harsh chemicals, creating an environment that preserves the native state of cellular proteins. Consequently, the proteins maintain their structural integrity and functionality, a marked departure from the denaturing effects of detergent-based buffers.

== Detergents, salts &amp; enzymes ==
Cell lysis is a critical step in the purification of enzymes from bacterial cells, various components are commonly included in lysing buffers to facilitate effective cell disruption and release of the target enzyme. These components include detergents, salts, and enzymes, each playing a specific role in the lysis process. Examples of detergents used in lysing buffers include:

Detergents:

Detergents are amphipathic molecules that possess both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. In the context of cell lysis, detergents act by disrupting the lipid bilayer of the bacterial cell membrane, leading to membrane permeabilization and release of intracellular components, including the target enzyme.

Commonly used detergents in lysing buffers include:

a. Triton X-100: a nonionic detergent frequently employed due to its mild and effective membrane-disrupting properties, it solubilizes lipids and membrane proteins, allowing the release of intracellular contents.

b. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS): an anionic detergent that denatures proteins by disrupting their secondary and tertiary structures, it solubilizes cellular membranes and aids in protein extraction.

c. Tween-20: a nonionic detergent is milder compared to SDS and Triton X-100. It assists in membrane permeabilization and solubilization of proteins without causing significant denaturation.

Salts:

Salts are crucial components of lysing buffers as they help maintain optimal cellular conditions and provide ionic strength to facilitate cell disruption.

Commonly used salts in lysing buffers include:

a. Sodium chloride (NaCl): NaCl is often included to maintain isotonic conditions, preventing osmotic shock and cell rupture during the lysis process.

b. Potassium chloride (KCl): Similar to NaCl, KCl can be used to adjust the ionic strength and facilitate cell lysis.

Enzymes:

Certain enzymes are added to lysing buffers to enhance cell lysis by digesting specific cellular components that can interfere with the extraction of the target enzyme.

Examples of enzymes used in lysing buffers include:

a. Lysozyme: Lysozyme breaks down the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls, weakening their structural integrity and facilitating subsequent disruption. It is particularly effective for Gram-positive bacteria.

b. DNase (Deoxyribonuclease): DNase degrades DNA present in the lysate, reducing its viscosity and preventing DNA-related interference in downstream purification steps.

c. RNase (Ribonuclease): Similar to DNase, RNase degrades RNA in the lysate, reducing its viscosity and minimizing RNA-related interference.

The specific combination and concentrations of detergents, salts, and enzymes in lysing buffers can vary depending on the target enzyme, cell type, and experimental requirements, optimization of these components is crucial to achieve efficient cell lysis while preserving the stability and activity of the desired enzyme during the purification process.

== Lysis buffer in DNA and RNA studies ==
In studies like DNA fingerprinting the lysis buffer is used for DNA isolation. Dish soap can be used in a pinch to break down the cell and nuclear membranes, allowing the DNA to be released. Other such lysis buffers include the proprietary Qiagen product Buffer P2.

<text>Baron Northbourne, of Betteshanger in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1884 for Sir Walter James, 2nd Baronet, who had earlier represented Kingston upon Hull in the House of Commons as a Conservative. His son, the second Baron, sat as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Gateshead. The latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the fifth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1982, was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat as a cross-bencher until his retirement in 2018. , the titles are held by his son, the sixth baron, who succeeded his father in that year.

The James baronetcy, of Langley Hall, in the County of Berkshire, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1791 for the first Baron&#x27;s grandfather Sir Walter James, the last Warden of the Mint. Born Walter James Head, he assumed by Act of Parliament the surname of James only in 1778, on inheriting the estates of his brother William (himself having inherited the estates of their uncle-in-law, John James of Denford Court). His son and heir John James notably served as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Netherlands. The latter was the father of the second Baronet, who was raised to the peerage in 1884.

The Hon. Cuthbert James, second son of the second Baron, represented Bromley in the House of Commons as a Conservative between 1919 and 1930.

The first Baron Northbourne was the grandson of Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry, making him first cousin twice removed of Sir Winston Churchill, who was the grandson of his first cousin Lady Frances Anne Emily Vane, Duchess of Marlborough. He was also the great grandson of Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden.

<text>Nicholas John Simper (born 3 November 1945) is an English bass guitarist, who was a co-founding member of Deep Purple and Warhorse. In the 1960s, he began his professional career in bands such as Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates, The Flower Pot Men, and Lord Sutch&#x27;s Savages.

==Biography==
Simper was born in Frogmore House Maternity Home, Norwood Green, Southall, Middlesex. Prior to co-founding Deep Purple in 1968, Simper played for a number of bands, including The Renegades (1960–61), The Delta Five (1961–63), Some Other Guys (1963–64), Buddy Britten &amp; The Regents renamed Simon Raven Cult (1964–66) and Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates. After a few months of his joining The Pirates, Simper and Kidd were involved in a car crash that took Kidd&#x27;s life and left Simper injured. After recovering, Simper briefly reactivated The Pirates as a tribute band to Kidd (1966–67) before joining the Garden, the backing band for The Flower Pot Men (1967–68), where he played alongside Jon Lord who initially suggested that Simper be asked to join Deep Purple. Simper also had a brief encounter with Lord Sutch&#x27;s Savages.

Simper played bass on three Deep Purple albums from 1968 to 1969. He was fired from Deep Purple in mid-1969 together with original singer Rod Evans. When new singer Ian Gillan from the band Episode Six was sought as a replacement for Evans, bandmate Roger Glover tagged along to play bass at some rehearsals and recorded the single &quot;Hallelujah&quot; for Deep Purple. Ritchie Blackmore had also appeared in interviews during disputes with Simper.

After his departure, he briefly worked with Marsha Hunt before forming his own band Warhorse, that recorded two albums for Vertigo. Warhorse was managed by Ron Hire, originally part of HEC Enterprises, the original investors in Deep Purple. During this time, Simper also played on a Lord Sutch live album, along with Ritchie Blackmore and Keith Moon.

For Warhorse, the breakthrough of a big selling album had not occurred. There was very strong interest from Warner Bros., with their senior A&amp;R rep (Dave Dee) attempting to sign the band to the label. At Warner Bros. expense, they went into the studio and recorded two tracks, competing with Heavy Metal Kids.

By 1974, crippling finances signalled the end for the band. Warhorse&#x27;s last gig in late 1974 was at Polhill College, Bedford. Unfortunately, their 2000-Watt Midas P.A. broke down and despite the best efforts of their roadie and managers it could not be made to perform properly. They tried, and performed a B.B. King song (Three O&#x27;clock in the Morning) to see if they could manage some kind of performance, but made their apologies to the audience and left.

Simper and guitarist Pete Parks spent the next three years writing, recording and initially formed a new band, called Nick Simper&#x27;s Dynamite (1975) that released one single.

On 9 October 1976, Simper took part in the Johnny Kidd 10th Anniversary Memorial Show at the Edwardian Club at the Loughborough Hotel in Brixton.

With no financial backing, along with Parks, Simper succeeded to get Nick Simper&#x27;s Fandango (1977–83) off the ground and released two albums. Around the same time, Frankie Reid formed the band Flying Fox (1977–84) with Carlo Little, Simper and Parks to play rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll whenever they were free from commitments from their other bands.

After Little&#x27;s departure the band renamed itself The Good Old Boys (1985–present). In the mid-1990s, drummer Mick Underwood invited Simper to become part of the reactivated Quatermass, which had released one album on Harvest in 1970. Under the guise of Quatermass II (1994–97) they recorded one album.

In 2007, Simper also joined the line-up of Adelle &amp; Co with Parks, Adelle Kirk, Jim Byers and Richard Hudson.

Since launching his own website in the 2000s, Simper has renewed his contact with a wider audience. The renaissance of his work has led to a one-off reunion of Warhorse in 2003 (and also 2005). During a gig in Austria in 2007, Simper performed the Deep Purple song &quot;Emmaretta&quot; with the support band Nasty Habits. On 6 September 2008, The Good Ol&#x27; Boys stepped in towards the end to support Deep Purple tribute band 24 Carat Purple at the Mick Jagger Centre, Dartford. Simper played &quot;Hush&quot; as a guest with this band, using bassist Pete Hartley&#x27;s bass guitar. In March 2009, Simper again performed with Nasty Habits in Austria. The band played a setlist composed of songs from the first three Deep Purple studio albums. Later that year, Nick Simper &amp; Nasty Habits played another show in Plock, Poland.

In 2010, Simper and Nasty Habits played more shows presenting &quot;The Deep Purple Mark One Songbook&quot; in Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and Poland while an album was in the making. The Budapest show was recorded for future release.

===Rock and Roll Hall of Fame snub===
In 2016, Deep Purple was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. All members from the band&#x27;s first seven years (1968 to 1974) were announced as individual inductees, except Simper, but including original lead singer Rod Evans whose tenure in Deep Purple paralleled Simper&#x27;s. Evans had also been successfully sued by Deep Purple&#x27;s management in 1980 for performing an unauthorized tour under the band name; Simper had been approached by the same promotion company that had hired Evans, but declined to participate.

Simper stated, &quot;Yes, it is a little strange that I am [the] only one from Marks I, II and III being left out, but I shan&#x27;t lose any sleep over this. It&#x27;s not as if I need to be given this award to know what we did in Deep Purple made an impact. And I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t a decision that came from the band.&quot;

<text>In commutative algebra, a regular sequence is a sequence of elements of a commutative ring which are as independent as possible, in a precise sense. This is the algebraic analogue of the geometric notion of a complete intersection.

==Definitions==
Given a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, an element &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; is called a non-zero-divisor on &quot;M&quot; if &quot;r m&quot; = 0 implies &quot;m&quot; = 0 for &quot;m&quot; in &quot;M&quot;. An &quot;M&quot;-regular sequence is a sequence
&quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot; of elements of &quot;R&quot; such that &quot;r&quot;1 is a not a zero-divisor on &quot;M&quot; and &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a not a zero-divisor on &quot;M&quot;/(&quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1)&quot;M&quot; for &quot;i&quot; = 2, ..., &quot;d&quot;. Some authors also require that &quot;M&quot;/(&quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot;)&quot;M&quot; is not zero. Intuitively, to say that 
&quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot; is an &quot;M&quot;-regular sequence means that these elements &quot;cut &quot;M&quot; down&quot; as much as possible, when we pass successively from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;M&quot;/(&quot;r&quot;1)&quot;M&quot;, to &quot;M&quot;/(&quot;r&quot;1, &quot;r&quot;2)&quot;M&quot;, and so on.

An &quot;R&quot;-regular sequence is called simply a regular sequence. That is, &quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot; is a regular sequence if &quot;r&quot;1 is a non-zero-divisor in &quot;R&quot;, &quot;r&quot;2 is a non-zero-divisor in the ring &quot;R&quot;/(&quot;r&quot;1), and so on. In geometric language, if &quot;X&quot; is an affine scheme and &quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot; is a regular sequence in the ring of regular functions on &quot;X&quot;, then we say that the closed subscheme {&quot;r&quot;1=0, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot;=0} ⊂ &quot;X&quot; is a complete intersection subscheme of &quot;X&quot;.

Being a regular sequence may depend on the order of the elements. For example, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;(1-&quot;x&quot;), &quot;z&quot;(1-&quot;x&quot;) is a regular sequence in the polynomial ring C[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;], while &quot;y&quot;(1-&quot;x&quot;), &quot;z&quot;(1-&quot;x&quot;), &quot;x&quot; is not a regular sequence. But if &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian local ring and the elements &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; are in the maximal ideal, or if &quot;R&quot; is a graded ring and the &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; are homogeneous of positive degree, then any permutation of a regular sequence is a regular sequence.

Let &quot;R&quot; be a Noetherian ring, &quot;I&quot; an ideal in &quot;R&quot;, and &quot;M&quot; a finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module. The depth of &quot;I&quot; on &quot;M&quot;, written depth&quot;R&quot;(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) or just depth(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;M&quot;), is the supremum of the lengths of all &quot;M&quot;-regular sequences of elements of &quot;I&quot;. When &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian local ring and &quot;M&quot; is a finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module, the depth of &quot;M&quot;, written depth&quot;R&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) or just depth(&quot;M&quot;), means depth&quot;R&quot;(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;M&quot;); that is, it is the supremum of the lengths of all &quot;M&quot;-regular sequences in the maximal ideal &quot;m&quot; of &quot;R&quot;. In particular, the depth of a Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot; means the depth of &quot;R&quot; as a &quot;R&quot;-module. That is, the depth of &quot;R&quot; is the maximum length of a regular sequence in the maximal ideal.

For a Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot;, the depth of the zero module is ∞, whereas the depth of a nonzero finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is at most the Krull dimension of &quot;M&quot; (also called the dimension of the support of &quot;M&quot;).

==Examples==

*Given an integral domain formula_1 any nonzero formula_2 gives a regular sequence.
*For a prime number &quot;p&quot;, the local ring Z(&quot;p&quot;) is the subring of the rational numbers consisting of fractions whose denominator is not a multiple of &quot;p&quot;. The element &quot;p&quot; is a non-zero-divisor in Z(&quot;p&quot;), and the quotient ring of Z(&quot;p&quot;) by the ideal generated by &quot;p&quot; is the field Z/(&quot;p&quot;). Therefore &quot;p&quot; cannot be extended to a longer regular sequence in the maximal ideal (&quot;p&quot;), and in fact the local ring Z(&quot;p&quot;) has depth 1.
*For any field &quot;k&quot;, the elements &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; in the polynomial ring &quot;A&quot; = &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;] form a regular sequence. It follows that the localization &quot;R&quot; of &quot;A&quot; at the maximal ideal &quot;m&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) has depth at least &quot;n&quot;. In fact, &quot;R&quot; has depth equal to &quot;n&quot;; that is, there is no regular sequence in the maximal ideal of length greater than &quot;n&quot;.
*More generally, let &quot;R&quot; be a regular local ring with maximal ideal &quot;m&quot;. Then any elements &quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot; of &quot;m&quot; which map to a basis for &quot;m&quot;/&quot;m&quot;2 as an &quot;R&quot;/&quot;m&quot;-vector space form a regular sequence.

An important case is when the depth of a local ring &quot;R&quot; is equal to its Krull dimension: &quot;R&quot; is then said to be Cohen-Macaulay. The three examples shown are all Cohen-Macaulay rings. Similarly, a finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is said to be Cohen-Macaulay if its depth equals its dimension.

=== Non-Examples ===
A simple non-example of a regular sequence is given by the sequence formula_3 of elements in formula_4 since
:formula_5
has a non-trivial kernel given by the ideal formula_6 . Similar examples can be found by looking at minimal generators for the ideals generated from reducible schemes with multiple components and taking the subscheme of a component, but fattened.

==Applications==

*If &quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot; is a regular sequence in a ring &quot;R&quot;, then the Koszul complex is an explicit free resolution of &quot;R&quot;/(&quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot;) as an &quot;R&quot;-module, of the form:

:formula_7

In the special case where &quot;R&quot; is the polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;d&quot;], this gives a resolution of &quot;k&quot; as an &quot;R&quot;-module.

*If &quot;I&quot; is an ideal generated by a regular sequence in a ring &quot;R&quot;, then the associated graded ring

:formula_8

is isomorphic to the polynomial ring (&quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;)[&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;d&quot;]. In geometric terms, it follows that a local complete intersection subscheme &quot;Y&quot; of any scheme &quot;X&quot; has a normal bundle which is a vector bundle, even though &quot;Y&quot; may be singular.

<doc id="505127" wikidata="Q321313" url="?curid=505127" title="Rod Evans">
<text>Roderic Evans (born 19 January 1947) is a retired British singer known as the original vocalist of the rock bands Deep Purple and Captain Beyond.

Evans began his professional career in The Maze before becoming a founding member of Deep Purple in 1968, with whom he recorded their first three studio albums. After recording a solo single, he co-founded Captain Beyond in 1971, with whom he recorded their first two studio albums. Following a brief legal battle with Deep Purple in 1980, Evans retired from music.

==Early career==
Rod Evans was born on 19 January 1947 in Edinburgh, Scotland but grew up in Slough, Buckinghamshire, England.
He &quot;had been fronting groups since he was 17&quot; and played together with drummer Ian Paice in The Maze, formerly MI5. He was also in a band called The Horizons in the mid-1960s.

==Deep Purple==

Evans and Paice were original members of Deep Purple when they formed in Hertfordshire in 1968. 

According to Deep Purple&#x27;s founding bassist, Nick Simper, Evans was hired after &quot;dozens&quot; of other singers were auditioned. Evans clinched his place in the band after sharing an idea to rearrange the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Help!&quot; as a ballad. This version of &quot;Help!&quot; was subsequently recorded for Deep Purple&#x27;s debut album &quot;Shades of Deep Purple&quot;, but the most recognised song recorded with Evans is a cover of a Joe South composition called &quot;Hush&quot;, which reached No. 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in October 1968.

Deep Purple had one other US Top 40 hit with Evans on vocals, a cover of Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Kentucky Woman&quot;, which appeared on the band&#x27;s second album and peaked at No. 38. Both &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Woman&quot; are used in the Quentin Tarantino film, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

After recording three studio albums and one non-album single (&quot;Emmaretta&quot;), Evans was dismissed in the summer of 1969 while on tour, with the last Deep Purple performance to feature Evans and Nick Simper taking place at the Top Rank in Cardiff, Wales on 4 July 1969. Evans was replaced by Ian Gillan. It had been decided by Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice that Evans&#x27; pop vocal style would not be suitable for the heavier hard rock sound the band wanted to achieve moving forward. Another factor in Evans&#x27; dismissal from Deep Purple was his desire to move to the United States.

==Captain Beyond==
In 1971, Evans recorded a solo single for Capitol, titled &quot;Hard To Be Without You&quot; (b/w &quot;You Can&#x27;t Love A Child Like A Woman&quot;). That same year, he went on to form Captain Beyond, along with former Johnny Winter drummer Bobby Caldwell, former Iron Butterfly bassist Lee Dorman and guitarist Larry &quot;Rhino&quot; Reinhardt, who also was part of the last incarnation of Iron Butterfly.

Evans left Captain Beyond and the music business after two albums. He acquired a medical degree and became a director of respiratory therapy at a California hospital until 1980.

==Deep Purple controversy and lawsuit==

In 1980, Evans was approached by a management company that specialized in the unscrupulous and frequently legally actionable practice of reforming groups with a minimum of original members, often in violation of trademark and contractual law. They offered him a chance to sing again under the Deep Purple name and he accepted. According to Nick Simper, the original Deep Purple bassist, Evans asked him to join the &quot;new&quot; Deep Purple, but Simper refused. Evans himself claimed in September 1980 that his former Deep Purple bandmates Jon Lord and Ian Paice had also been contacted to participate, but both were uninterested. This &quot;bogus Deep Purple&quot;, comprising no former Deep Purple members apart from Evans, played a number of shows in Canada, Mexico and the US. The band performed renditions of songs from Evans&#x27; own tenure in the band, which Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson described as &quot;reasonable&quot;, while also playing selected songs from the Gillan and Coverdale eras. These songs were described as &quot;horrendous&quot; and confirmed the &quot;bogus Deep Purple&#x27;s...complete lack of legitimate credentials&quot;. Several shows ended in what was described as &quot;rioting&quot;, with chairs being thrown onto the stage at a gig in Toronto on August 12, 1980. The band had also talked of releasing an album of new material under the &quot;Deep Purple&quot; name, with 6 tracks being recorded in Los Angeles; this angered Jon Lord, who described such a possibility as &quot;the worst lie&quot;.

A registered company, Deep Purple Overseas Ltd., had been registered with Companies House in the UK 9 years prior in 1971 to safeguard the &quot;Deep Purple&quot; name from unwarranted exploitation. Members of the management team for the then-disbanded genuine Deep Purple, John Coletta and Tony Edwards, successfully sued and were awarded $672,000 in damages. As a result, Evans stopped receiving royalties from the Mark I Deep Purple albums and singles.

==Later life==
Evans has not appeared publicly since the 1980 court case and his current whereabouts have been of considerable interest to fans of early Deep Purple online since at least the late 1990s. 

In 2015, Ian Paice said, &quot;If anyone knows where Rod is or even if he is still on the planet, that would be good news. We haven&#x27;t had contact with him since the late 1970s. Nobody seems to know where the hell he is, or even if he is still alive. Not a clue.&quot;

In a 2015 interview, Captain Beyond drummer Bobby Caldwell mentioned that he was in touch with Evans, saying that Evans is &quot;just doing fine these days&quot; and had gone back to working in respiratory therapy for a long time. Caldwell similarly confirmed in September 2017 that Evans was &quot;doing great&quot;, adding that Evans, who is married to another respiratory therapist, was residing in Northern California and had no plans to perform again. 

Evans was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple in 2016 but, despite being invited, he did not attend the ceremony.

<doc id="505154" wikidata="Q1045322" url="?curid=505154" title="Nanzhao">
<text>Nanzhao (), also spelled Nanchao, , Yi language: ꂷꏂꌅ, &quot;Mashynzy&quot;) was a dynastic kingdom that flourished in what is now southwestern China and northern Southeast Asia during the 8th and 9th centuries, during the mid/late Tang dynasty. It was centered on present-day Yunnan in China, with its capitals in modern-day Dali City. The kingdom was officially called Dameng (大蒙) from 738 to 859 AD, Dali (大禮) from 859 to 877 and Dafengmin (大封民) from 877 to 902.

==History==


===Origins===
Nanzhao encompassed many ethnic and linguistic groups. Some historians believe that the majority of the population were the Bai people (then known as the &quot;White Man&quot;) and the Yi people (then known as the &quot;Black Man&quot;), but that the elite spoke a variant of Nuosu (also called &quot;Yi&quot;), a Northern Loloish language. Scriptures unearthed from Nanzhao were written in the Bai language.

The Cuanman people came to power in Yunnan during Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Southern Campaign in 225. By the fourth century they had gained control of the region, but they rebelled against the Sui dynasty in 593 and were destroyed by a retaliatory expedition in 602. The Cuan split into two groups known as the Black and White Mywa. The White Mywa (Baiman) tribes, who are considered the predecessors of the Bai people, settled on the fertile land of western Yunnan around the alpine fault lake Erhai. The Black Mywa (Wuman), considered to be predecessors of the Yi people, settled in the mountainous regions of eastern Yunnan. These tribes were called Mengshe (蒙舍), Mengxi (蒙嶲), Langqiong (浪穹), Tengtan (邆賧), Shilang (施浪), and Yuexi (越析). Each tribe was known as a &quot;zhao&quot;. In academia, the ethnic composition of the Nanzhao kingdom&#x27;s population has been debated for a century. Some non-Chinese scholars subscribed to the theory that the Tai ethnic group was a major component and later moved south into modern-day Thailand and Laos. The historiography of the origins of Nanzhao people has attracted much interest.

Among them, Mengshe zhao was recorded as Ma Shizi ( ꂷꏂꌅ ma shy nzy ) in Yi classics, which means &quot;King of Golden Bamboo&quot;. Because it is located in the south, Mengshe was called Nanzhao or southern Zhao.

===Founding===
In 649, the chieftain of the Mengshe tribe, Xinuluo (細奴邏, Senola), son of Jiadupang and grandson of Shelong, founded the Great Meng (大蒙) and took the title of Qijia Wang (奇嘉王; &quot;Outstanding King&quot;). He acknowledged Tang suzerainty. In 652, Xinuluo absorbed the White Mywa realm of Zhang Lejinqiu, who ruled Erhai Lake and Cang Mountain. This event occurred peacefully as Zhang made way for Xinuluo of his own accord. The agreement was consecrated under an iron pillar in Dali. Thereafter the Black and White Mywa acted as warriors and ministers respectively. In 655, Xinuluo sent his eldest son to Chang&#x27;an to ask for the Tang dynasty&#x27;s protection. The Tang emperor appointed Xinuluo as prefect of Weizhou, sent him an embroidered official robe, and sent troops to defeat rebellious tribes in 672, thus enhancing Xinuluou&#x27;s position. Xinuluo was succeeded by his son, Luoshengyan, who travelled to Chang&#x27;an to make tribute to the Tang. In 704, the Tibetan Empire made the White Mywa tribes into tributaries, whilst subjugating the Black Mywa. In 713, Luoshengyan was succeeded by his son, Shengluopi, who was also on good terms with the Tang. He was succeeded by his son, Piluoge, in 733.

Piluoge began expanding his realm in the early 730s. He first annexed the neighboring zhao of Mengsui, whose ruler, Zhaoyuan, was blind. Piluoge supported Zhaoyuan&#x27;s son, Yuanluo, in his accession, and in turn weakened Mengsui. After Zhaoyuan was assassinated, Piluoge drove Yuanluo from Mengsui and annexed the territory. The remaining banded together against Piluoge, who thwarted them with an alliance with the Tang dynasty. Not long after 733, the Tang official Yan Zhenghui cooperated with Piluoge in a successful attack on the zhao of Shilang, and rewarded the Mengshe rulers with titles.

Two other also joined in the attack on Shilang: Dengdan ruled by Mieluopi and Langqiong ruled by Duoluowang. Piluoge moved to eliminate these competitors by bribing Wang Yu, the military commissioner of Jiannan (modern Sichuan based in Chengdu) to convince the Tang court to support him in uniting the Six Zhaos. Piluoge then made a surprise attack on Dengdan and defeated the forces of both Mieluopi and the ruler of Shilang, Shiwangqian. The zhao of Yuexi was annexed when its ruler, Bochong, was murdered by his wife&#x27;s lover, Zhangxunqiu. Zhangxunqiu was summoned by the Tang court and beaten to death. The territory of Yuexi was bestowed to Piluoge. Bochong&#x27;s son, Yuzeng, fled and resisted Nanzhao&#x27;s expansion for some time before he was defeated by Piluoge&#x27;s son, Geluofeng, and drowned in the Changjiang. Piluoge&#x27;s step-grandson grew jealous of the preeminence of his step-father, Geluofeng, and sought to create his own zhao by allying with the Tibetan Empire. His plans leaked out and he was killed.

In the year 737 AD, Piluoge (皮羅閣) united the Six Zhaos in succession, establishing a new kingdom called Nanzhao (Southern Zhao). In 738, the Tang granted Piluoge the Chinese-style name Meng Guiyi (&quot;return to righteousness&quot;) and the title of &quot;Prince of Yunnan&quot;. Piluoge set up a new capital at Taihe in 739, (the site of modern-day Taihe village, a few miles south of Dali). Located in the heart of the Erhai valley, the site was ideal: it could be easily defended against attack and it was in the midst of rich farmland. Under the reign of Piluoge, the White Mywa were removed from eastern Yunnan and resettled in the west. The Black and White Mywa were separated to create a more solidified caste system of ministers and warriors.

===Territorial expansion===
Piluoge died in 748, and was succeeded by his son Geluofeng (閣羅鳳).
When the Chinese prefect of Yunnan attempted to rob Nanzhao envoys in 750, Geluofeng attacked, killing the prefect and seizing nearby Tang territory. 
In retaliation, the Tang governor of Jiannan (modern Sichuan), Xianyu Zhongtong, attacked Nanzhao with an army of 80,000 soldiers in 751. He was defeated by Duan Jianwei (段俭魏) with heavy losses (many due to disease) at Xiaguan. Duan Jianwei&#x27;s grave is two kilometres west of Xiaguan, and the Tomb of Ten Thousand Soldiers is located in Tianbao Park.
In 754, another Tang army of 100,000 soldiers, led by General Li Mi (李宓), approached the kingdom from the north, but never made it past Mu&#x27;ege. By the end of 754, Geluofeng had established an alliance with the Tibetans against the Tang that would last until 794. In the same year, Nanzhao gained control of the salt marshes of Yanyuan County, which it used to regulate the salt to its people, a practice that would continue during the reign of the Dali kingdom.

Geluofeng accepted a Tibetan title and acted as part of the Tibetan Empire. His successor, Yimouxun, continued the pro-Tibetan policy. In 779, Yimouxun participated in a large Tibetan attack on the Tang dynasty. However the burden of having to support every single Tibetan military campaign against the Tang soon weighed on him. In 794, he severed ties with Tibet and switched sides to the Tang. In 795, Yimouxun attacked a Tibetan stronghold in Kunming. The Tibetans retaliated in 799 but were repelled by a joint Tang-Nanzhao force. In 801 Nanzhao and Tang in Battle of Dulu, Chinese and Nanzhao&#x27;s forces defeated a contingent of Tibetan and Abbasid slave soldiers. More than 10,000 Tibetan/Arabs soldiers were killed and some 6,000 captured. Nanzhao captured seven Tibetan cities and five military garrisons while more than a hundred fortifications were destroyed. This defeat shifted the balance of power in favor of the Tang and Nanzhao.

====Attack on Sichuan====
During the reign of Quanlongcheng (r.809-816), the ruler behaved without constraint, and was killed by Wang Cuodian, a powerful governor. The military generals in Nanzhao had become powerful after the victory in Tibet. Wang Cuodian installed a puppet ruler Quanlisheng. However, Quanlisheng quickly took power back three years later before he was himself replaced by Quanfengyou, with the aid of the generals. Quanfengyou and Wang Cuodian, who remained a powerful general, were instrumental in the expansion of Nanzhao territory. Nanzhao expanded into Myanmar,
conquering the Pyu city-states in the 820s and destroying the city of Halin in 832. They returned to Halin in 835 and carried off many prisoners.

In 829, Wang Cuodian attacked Chengdu, but withdrew the following year. Wang Cuodian&#x27;s invasion was not to take Sichuan but to push its territorial boundaries north and take the resources south of Chengdu. The advance of Nanzhaos&#x27; army was almost unopposed; the attack took advantage of chaos created in Sichuan by its governor, Du Yuanying. Bilateral relations between Nanzhao and Tang became delicate, as Wang Cuodian refused to step retreat from Yizhou, saying that Nanzhao had remained a loyal tributary and was only punishing Du Yuanying at the request of Tang soldiers.

In the 830s, they conquered the neighboring kingdoms of Kunlun to the east and Nuwang to the south.

====Invasion of Annan====
In 846, Nanzhao raided the southern Tang circuit of Annan. Relations with the Tang broke down after the death of Emperor Xuanzong in 859, when the Nanzhao king Shilong treated Tang envoys sent to receive his condolences with contempt, and launched raids on Bozhou and Annan. Shilong also killed Wang Cuodian. To recruit for his wars, Shilong ordered all men over the age 15 to join the army. Anti-Tang locals allied with highland people, who appealed to Nanzhao for help, and as a result invaded the area in 860, briefly taking Songping before being driven out by a Tang army the next year. Prior to Li Hu&#x27;s arrival, Nanzhao had already seized Bozhou. When Li Hu led an army to retake Bozhou, the Đỗ family gathered 30,000 men, including contingents from Nanzhao to attack the Tang. When Li Hu returned, he learned the Vietnamese rebels and Nanzhao had taken control over Annan out of his hand. In December 860, Songping fell to the rebels and Hu fled to Yongzhou. In summer 861, Li Hu retook Songping but Nanzhao forces moved around and seized Yongzhou. Hu was banished to Hainan island and was replaced by Wang Kuan.

Shilong attacked Annan again in 863, occupying it for three years. With the aid of locals, Nanzhao invaded with an army of 50,000 and besieged Annan&#x27;s capital Songping in mid-January. On 20 January, the defenders led by Cai Xi killed a hundred of the besiegers. Five days later, Cai Xi captured, tortured, and killed a group of besiegers known as the &quot;Púzǐ&quot; or &quot;Wangjuzi&quot; (according to some historians, the Puzi were ancestors of the Wa people. Description about them is indefinite). A local official named Liang Ke was related to them, and defected as a result. On 28 January, a Nanzhao Buddhist monk, possibly from the Indian continent, was wounded by an arrow while strutting to and fro naked outside the southern walls. On 14 February, Cai Xi shot down 200 Puzi and over 30 horses using a mounted crossbow from the walls. By 28 February, most of Cai Xi&#x27;s followers had perished, and he himself had been wounded several times by arrows and stones. The Nanzhao commander, Yang Sijin, penetrated the inner city. Cai Xi tried to escape by boat, but it capsized midstream, drowning him. The 400 remaining defenders wanted to flee as well, but could not find any boats, so they chose to make a last stand at the eastern gate. Ambushing a group of Nanzhao cavalry, they killed over 2,000 Nanzhao troops and 300 horses before Yang sent reinforcements from the inner city. After taking Songping, Nanzhao laid siege to Junzhou (modern Haiphong). A Nanzhao and rebel fleet of 4,000 men led by a native chieftain named Zhu Daogu (朱道古) was attacked by a local commander, who rammed their vessels and sank 30 boats, drowning them. In total, the invasion destroyed Chinese armies in Annan numbering over 150,000. Although initially welcomed by the locals in ousting Tang control, Nanzhao turned on them, ravaging the local population and countryside. Both Chinese and Vietnamese sources note that the Annanese locals fled to the mountains to avoid destruction. A government-in-exile for the protectorate was established in Haimen (near modern-day Hạ Long). Ten thousand soldiers from Shandong and all other armies of the Tang empire were called and concentrating at Halong Bay for reconquering Annan. A supply fleet of 1,000 ships from Fujian was organized.

====Tang counterattack====

The Tang launched a counterattack in 864 under Gao Pian, a general who had made his reputation fighting the Türks and the Tanguts in the north. In September 865, Gao&#x27;s 5,000 troops surprised a Nanzhao army of 50,000 while they were collecting rice from the villages and routed them. Gao captured large quantities of rice, which he used to feed his army. A jealous governor, Li Weizhou, accused Gao of stalling to meet the enemy, and reported him to the throne. The court sent another general named Wang Yanqian to replace Gao. In the meantime, Gao had been reinforced by 7,000 men who arrived overland under the command of Wei Zhongzai. In early 866, Gao&#x27;s 12,000 men defeated a fresh Nanzhao army and chased them back to the mountains. He then laid siege to Songping but had to leave command due to the arrival of Li Weizhou and Wang Yanqian. He was later reinstated after sending his aid, Zeng Gun, who went to the capital as his representative and explained his circumstances. Gao completed the retaking of Annan in fall 866, executing the enemy general, Duan Qiuqian, and beheading 30,000 of his men.

According to G. Evans in his final monograph &quot;The Tai Original Diaspora&quot;, there were probably a quite large number of indigenous Tai-speaking people in Northern Vietnam that threw their support for Nanzhao against the Chinese, and when the Chinese came back in 864, many Tai people were also victims of following Chinese suppression.

====Siege of Chengdu====
In 869, Shilong attacked Chengdu with the help of the Dongman tribe. The Dongman used to be an ally of the Tang during their wars against the Tibetan Empire in the 790s. Their service was rewarded with mistreatment by Yu Shizhen, the governor of Xizhou, who kidnapped Dongman tribesmen and sold them to other tribes. When the Nanzhao attacked Xizhou, the Dongman tribe opened the gates and welcomed them in.

Nanzhao invaded again in 874 and reached within 70 km of Chengdu, seizing Qiongzhou, however they ultimately retreated, being unable to take the capital.

====End of territorial expansion====
In 875, Gao Pian was appointed by the Tang to lead defenses against Nanzhao. He ordered all the refugees in Chengdu to return home. Gao led a force of 5,000 and chased the remaining Nanzhao troops to the Dadu River where he defeated them in a decisive battle, captured their armored horses, and executed 50 tribal leaders. He proposed to the court an invasion of Nanzhao with 60,000 troops. His proposal was rejected. Nanzhao forces were driven from the Bozhou region, modern Guizhou, in 877 by a local military force organized by the Yang family from Shanxi. This effectively ended Nanzhao&#x27;s expansionist campaigns. Shilong died in 877.

===Decline===

Shilong&#x27;s successor, Longshun, entered negotiations with the Tang for a marriage alliance, which was agreed to in 880. The marriage alliance never came to fruition owing to the Huang Chao rebellion. By the end of 880 the rebels had taken Luoyang and seized the Tong Pass. Longshun did not give up on the marriage however. In 883 he sent a delegation to Chengdu to fetch the Princess of Anhua. They brought with them one hundred rugs and carpets as betrothal gifts. The Nanzhao delegation was detained for two years due to a dispute in ceremony and failed to bring back the princess. In 897 Longshun was murdered by one of his own ministers. His successor, Shunhua, sent envoys to the Tang requesting restoration of friendly relations, but by this time the Tang emperor was merely a puppet figurehead of more powerful military governors. No response returned.

In 902, the dynasty came to a bloody end when the chief minister (&quot;buxie&quot;), Zheng Maisi, murdered the royal family and usurped the throne, renaming it to Dachanghe (大長和, 902–928). In 928, a White Mywa noble, Yang Ganzhen (Jianchuan Jiedushi), aided the chief minister, Zhao Shanzheng, in overthrowing the Zheng family and establishing Datianxing (大天興, 928–929). The new regime lasted only a year before Zhao was killed by Yang, who created Dayining (大義寧, 929–937). Finally Duan Siping seized power in 937 and established the Dali Kingdom.

==Military==

Nanzhao had an elite vanguard unit called the Luojuzi, which means tiger sons, that served as full-time soldiers. For every hundred soldiers, the strongest one was chosen for service in the Luojuzi. They were outfitted with red helmets, leather armour, and bronze shields, but went barefoot. Only wounds to the front were allowed and if they suffered any wounds to their back, they were executed. Their commander was called Luojuzuo. The king&#x27;s personal guards, known as the Zhunuquju, were recruited from the Luojuzi.

==Government==
Nanzhao society was separated into two distinct castes: the administrative White Mywa living in western Yunnan, and the militaristic Black Mywa in eastern Yunnan. The rulers of Nanzhao were from the Mengshe tribe of the Black Mywa. Nanzhao modelled its government on the Tang dynasty with ministries (nine instead of six) and imperial examinations. However the system of governance and rule in Nanzhao was essentially feudal. Sons of the Nanzhao aristocracy visited the Tang capital, Chang&#x27;an, to receive a Chinese education.

Sources that believe Nanzhao was a Yi dominated society also traditionally hold it to be a slave society because of how central the institution was to Yi culture. The prevalence of the slave culture was so great that sometimes children were named after the quality and quantity of slaves they owned or their parents wished to own. For example: Lurbbu (many slaves), Lurda (strong slaves), Lurshy (commander of slaves), Lurnji (origin of slaves), Lurpo (slave lord), Lurha, (hundred slaves), Jjinu (lots of slaves).

==Language and ethnicity==
Extant sources from Nanzhao and the later Dali Kingdom show that the ruling elite used Chinese script. Scriptures from Nanzhao unearthed in the 1950s show that it was written in the Bai language but Nanzhao does not seem to have ever attempted to standardize or popularize the script.

Leading families around the Nanzhao capital adopted Chinese surnames such as Yang, Li, Zhao, Dong, and claimed Han Chinese ancestry; however, the rulers instead presented themselves as Ailao descendants from Yongchang.

===Bai and Yi===
The ethnicity of Nanzhao&#x27;s ruling elite is not clear. Both the Yi people and Bai people in modern Yunnan claim descent from Nanzhao&#x27;s rulers.

In Weishan Yi and Hui Autonomous County, the Yi people claim direct descent from Xinuluo, the founder of Mengshe (Nanzhao).

The Bai people also trace their ancestry to Nanzhao and the Dali Kingdom, but records from those kingdoms do not mention Bai. &quot;Bai barbarians&quot; or &quot;Bo people&quot; were mentioned during the Tang dynasty and it is suspected that they might be the same name using different transcriptions; Bai and Bo were pronounced &quot;Baek&quot; and &quot;Bwok&quot; in the Tang period. The name Bo was first cited in the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; (c. 241 and 238 BC) and appeared again in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (begun in 104 BC). The earliest references to &quot;Bai people&quot;, or the &quot;Bo&quot;, in connection to the people of Yunnan are from the Yuan dynasty. A Bai script using Chinese characters was mentioned during the Ming dynasty. Scriptures dated to the Nanzhao period used the Bai language. According to Stevan Harrell, while the ethnic identity of Nanzhao&#x27;s ruling elite is still disputed, the subsequent Yang and Duan dynasties were both definitely Bai.

===Forced migrations===
The Nanzhao king Yimouxun (r. 779-808) conducted forced resettlement of several ethnicities.

===Bamar===
Nanzhao&#x27;s invasions of the Pyu city-states brought with them the Bamar people (Burmese people), who originally lived in present-day Qinghai and Gansu. The Bamar would form the Pagan Kingdom in medieval Myanmar. In 849, a fortified settlement was established along the Irrawaddy River, possibly to help Nanzhao pacify the area. It was situated at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and the Chindwin tributary to the west of an irrigated rice plain.

According to Burmese chronicles, after the Nanzhao invasions, a semimythical warrior-king named Pyusawhti arose. He was a giant and an excellent archer who came to Pagan and defeated a great bird, a great boar, a great tiger, and a flying squirrel. Legendary accounts say he was born from the union of a prince of the sun and a dragon egg or that he was a scion of the Shakya lineage of Tagaung. It is speculated that he was connected to the ruling dynasty of Nanzhao in some way due to practicing the same naming system. Pyusawhti and his descendants for seven generations used the same patronymic naming tradition that the Nanzhao kings practiced: the last part of a father&#x27;s name is used as the first part of the son&#x27;s name. It is also said that Pyusawhti achieved victory over the Chinese, which likely refers to Nanzhao defeating the Tang dynasty in a battle that Pyusawhti may have participated in.

==Religion==


===Benzhuism===
Almost nothing is known about pre-Buddhist religion in Nanzhao. According to Yuan dynasty sources, the Bai people practiced an indigenous religion called Benzhuism that worshiped local lords and deities. The Benzhu lords are spirits of people that died under special circumstances and are not hierarchically organized. Archaeological findings in Yunnan suggest that animal and human sacrifices were offered to the Benzhu lords around a metal pillar with the aid of bronze drums in return for wealth and health. The use of iron pillars for rituals seems to have been retained into the Dali Kingdom. The &quot;Nanzhao tuzhuan&quot; shows offerings to heaven occurring around one. The Bai people have female shamans and share a worship of white stones similar to the Qiang people.

===Bimoism===
Bimoism is the ethnic religion of the Yi people. The religion is named after the Shaman-priests known as &quot;bimo&quot;, which means &#x27;master of scriptures&#x27;, who officiate at births, funerals, weddings and holidays. One can become bimo by patrilinial descent after a time of apprenticeship or formally acknowledging an old &quot;bimo&quot; as the teacher. A lesser priest known as &quot;suni&quot; is elected, but &quot;bimo&quot; are more revered and can read Yi scripts while &quot;suni&quot; cannot. Both can perform rituals, but only &quot;bimo&quot; can perform rituals linked to death. For most cases, &quot;suni&quot; only perform some exorcism to cure diseases. Generally, &quot;suni&quot; can only be from humble civil birth while &quot;bimo&quot; can be of both aristocratic and humble families.

The Yi worshiped and deified their ancestors similar to the Chinese folk religion, and also worshiped gods of nature: fire, hills, trees, rocks, water, earth, sky, wind and forests. Bimoists also worship dragons, believed to be protectors from bad spirits that cause illness, poor harvests and other misfortunes. Bimoists believe in multiple souls. At death, one soul remains to watch the grave while the other is eventually reincarnated into some living form. After someone dies they sacrifice a pig or sheep at the doorway to maintain relationship with the deceased spirit.

===Buddhism===
Buddhism practiced in Nanzhao and the Dali Kingdom was known as Azhali (Acharya), founded around 821-824 by a monk from India called Li Xian Maishun. More monks from India arrived in 825 and 828 and built a temple in Heqing. In 839, an acharya named Candragupta entered Nanzhao. Quanfengyou appointed him as a state mentor and married his sister Yueying to Candragupta. It was said that he meditated in a thatched cottage of Fengding Mountain in the east of Heqing, and became an &quot;enlightened God.&quot; He established an altar to propagate tantric doctrines in Changdong Mountain of Tengchong. Candragupta continued to propagate tantric doctrines, translated the tantric scripture &quot;The Rites of the Great Consecration&quot;, and engaged in water conservancy projects. He left for his homeland later on and possibly went to Tibet to propagate his teachings. When he returned to Nanzhao, he built Wuwei Temple.

In 851, an inscription in Jianchuan dedicated images to Maitreya and Amitabha. The Nanzhao king Quanfengyou commissioned Chinese architects from the Tang dynasty to build the Three Pagodas. The last king of Nanzhao established Buddhism as the official state religion. In the &quot;Nanzhao Tushu juan&quot;, the Nanzhao Buddhist elite are depicted with light skin whereas the people who oppose Buddhism are depicted as short and dark skinned.

Azhali is considered a sect of Tantrism or esoteric Buddhism. Acharya itself means guru or teacher in Sanskrit. According to Azhali practices among the Bai people, acharyas were allowed to marry and have children. The position of acharya was hereditary. The acharyas became state mentors in Nanzhao and held great influence until the Mongol conquest of China in the 13th century, during which the acharyas called upon various peoples to resist the Mongol rulers and later the Chinese during the Ming conquest of Yunnan. Zhu Yuanzhang banned the dissemination of Azhali Buddhism for a time before setting up an office to administer the religion.

The area had a strong connection with Tantric Buddhism, which has survived to this day at Jianchuan and neighboring areas. The worship of Guanyin and Mahākāla is very different from other forms of Chinese Buddhism. Nanzhao likely had strong religious connections with the Pagan Kingdom in what is today Myanmar, as well as Tibet and Bengal (see Pala Empire).

<doc id="505162" wikidata="Q310633" url="?curid=505162" title="Demetrius of Thessaloniki">
<text>Saint Demetrius (or Demetrios) of [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]] (, ), also known as the Holy [[Great martyr|Great-Martyr]] Demetrius the [[Myroblyte]] (meaning &#x27;the Myrrh-Gusher&#x27; or &#x27;Myrrh-Streamer&#x27;; 3rd century – 306), was a Greek Christian martyr of the early 4th century AD.

During the Middle Ages, he came to be revered as one of the most important Orthodox military saints, often paired with Saint George of Lydda. His feast day is 26 October for Eastern Orthodox Christians, which falls on 8 November [NS, &quot;new style&quot;] for those following the old calendar. In the Roman Catholic Church he is most commonly called Demetrius of Sirmium and his memorial is 9 April in the 2004 Roman Martyrology and 8 October in the martyrology of the Extraordinary Form. It is debated whether Demetrius of Thessalonica and Demetrius of Sirmium are the same person.

==Life==
The earliest written accounts of his life were compiled in the 9th century, although there are earlier images of him, and the 7th-century &quot;Miracles of Saint Demetrius&quot; collection. According to these early accounts, Demetrius was born to pious Christian parents in Thessalonica, Macedonia in 270.

According to the hagiographies, Demetrius was a young man of senatorial family who became proconsul of the Thessalonica district. He was run through with spears in around 306 in Thessalonica, during the Christian persecutions under the emperor Galerius, which matches his depiction in the 7th-century mosaics.
==Veneration of sainthood and celebrations==
===Evolution during Byzantine Empire===
====Transfer to Thessaloniki; gaining of military attributes====
Most historical scholars follow the hypothesis put forward by Bollandist Hippolyte Delehaye (1859–1941), that his veneration was transferred from Sirmium when Thessaloniki replaced it as the main military base in the area in 441/442 AD. His very large church in Thessaloniki, the Hagios Demetrios, dates from the mid-5th century. Thessaloniki remained a centre of his veneration, and he is the patron saint of the city.

After the growth of his veneration as saint, the city of Thessaloniki suffered repeated attacks and sieges from the Slavic peoples who moved into the Balkans, and Demetrius was credited with many miraculous interventions to defend the city. Hence later traditions about Demetrius regard him as a soldier in the Roman army, and he came to be regarded as an important military martyr.

====From pagan Demeter to St Demetrios====
Demetrius was also venerated as patron of agriculture, peasants and shepherds in the Greek countryside during the Middle Ages. According to historian Hans Kloft, he had inherited this role from the pagan goddess Demeter. After the demise of the Eleusinian Mysteries, Demeter&#x27;s cult, in the 4th century, the Greek rural population had gradually transferred her rites and roles onto the Christian saint Demetrius.

===During the Crusades===
Unsurprisingly, he was extremely popular in the Middle Ages. Disputes between Bohemond I of Antioch and Alexios I Komnenos appear to have resulted in Demetrius being appropriated as patron saint of crusading.

===Relics===
Most scholars still believe that for four centuries after his death, Demetrius had no physical relics, and in their place an unusual empty shrine called the &quot;ciborium&quot; was built inside &quot;Hagios Demetrios&quot;. What were purported to be his remains subsequently appeared in Thessaloniki, but the local archbishop John, who compiled the first book of the &quot;Miracles&quot; ca. 610, was publicly dismissive of their authenticity. The relics were assumed to be genuine after they started emitting a liquid and strong-scented myrrh. This gave Demeterius the epithet &quot;Myroblyte&quot;.

===Veneration in Orthodox world outside Greece===
Demetrius was a patron saint of the Rurik dynasty from the late 11th century on. Izyaslav I of Kiev (whose Christian name was Dimitry) founded the first East Slavic monastery dedicated to this saint.

In the Russian Orthodox Church, the Saturday before the Feast of Saint Demetrius is a memorial day commemorating the soldiers who fell in the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), under the leadership of Demetrius of the Don. This day is known as Demetrius Saturday.

The Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Romanian Orthodox Church revere Demetrius on 26 October ( [] in Bulgarian); meanwhile, the Serbian Orthodox Church and Macedonian Orthodox Church (Ohrid) and the Coptic Church have a feast on 8 November (called [] in Serbian and [] in Macedonian).

===Derived personal names===
The names Dimitar (Bulgarian and Macedonian), Dimitry (Russian), Dimitris (Δημήτρης, Greek), Dumitru (Romanian), Mitri (short form of Dimitri in Lebanon) are in common use.

==Iconography==
The hagiographic cycles of the Great Martyr Demetrius of Thessaloniki include depictions of scenes from his life and his posthumous miracles. Demetrius was initially depicted in icons and mosaics as a young man in patterned robes with the distinctive &quot;tablion&quot; of the senatorial class across his chest. Miraculous military interventions were attributed to him during several attacks on Thessaloniki, and he gradually became thought of as a soldier: a Constantinopolitan ivory of the late 10th century shows him as an infantry soldier (Metropolitan Museum of Art). But, an icon of the late 11th century in Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai shows him as before, still a civilian. In Byzantine icons he is depicted in military dress, either standing or riding a horse.

Another Sinai icon, of the Crusader period and painted by a French artist working in the Holy Land in the second half of the 12th century, shows what then became the most common depiction. Demetrius, bearded, rather older, and on a red horse, rides together with George, unbearded and on a white horse. Both are dressed as cavalrymen. Also, while George is often shown spearing a dragon, Demetrius is depicted spearing the gladiator Lyaeus ( ; for meaning see here), who according to story was responsible for killing many Christians. Lyaeus is commonly depicted below Demetrius and lying supine, having already been defeated; Lyaeus is traditionally drawn much smaller than Demetrius. In traditional hagiography, Demetrius did not directly kill Lyaeus, but rather through his prayers the gladiator was defeated by Demetrius&#x27; disciple, Nestor.

A modern Greek iconographic convention depicts Demetrius with the &quot;Great White Tower&quot; in the background. The anachronistic White Tower acts as a symbolic depiction of the city of Thessaloniki, despite having been built in the 16th century, centuries after his life, and the exact architecture of the older tower that stood at the same site in earlier times is unknown. Again, iconography often depicts saints holding a church or protecting a city.

According to a hagiographic legend, best known in Russia in the version retold by Dimitry of Rostov (1651–1709), Demetrius appeared in the camp of tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria during his 1207 siege of Thessaloniki, piercing the king with a lance and so killing him. 
This scene, known in Russian as (&quot;the miracle of the destruction of tsar Kaloyan&quot;) became a popular element in the iconography of Demetrius. He is shown on horseback piercing the king with his spear, paralleling the iconography (and often shown alongside) of Saint George and the Dragon.

<text>Machynlleth () is a market town, community and electoral ward in Powys, Wales and within the historic boundaries of Montgomeryshire. It is in the Dyfi Valley at the intersection of the A487 and the A489 roads. At the 2001 Census it had a population of 2,147, rising to 2,235 in 2011. It is sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;Mach&quot;.

Machynlleth was the seat of Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s Welsh Parliament in 1404, and as such claims to be the &quot;ancient capital of Wales&quot;. However, it has never held any official recognition as a capital. It applied for city status in 2000 and 2002, but was unsuccessful. It is twinned with Belleville, Michigan.

Machynlleth hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1937 and 1981.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name Machynlleth derives from [field, plain] and . The ending &#x27;s&#x27; of is the cause of the &#x27;c&#x27; of becoming &#x27;ch&#x27;: reflecting a standard phonological development in Welsh.

== History ==
There is a long history of human activity in the Machynlleth area. In the late 1990s, radiocarbon dating showed that copper was being mined in the Early Bronze Age ( 2,750 years ago), within of the town centre.

The Romans settled in the area; they built a fort at Cefn Caer, near Pennal, west of Machynlleth, and are reputed to have had two look-out posts above the town at and , and another fort, called Maglona, at Machynlleth. One of the earliest written references to Machynlleth is the Royal charter granted in 1291 by Edward I to Owen de la Pole, Lord of Powys. This gave him the right to hold &quot;a market at Machynlleth every Wednesday for ever and two fairs every year&quot;. The Wednesday market is still a busy and popular day in Machynlleth 700 years later.

The Royal House, which stands on the corner of the , is another of the mediaeval houses that can still be seen today. According to local tradition, Dafydd Gam, a Welsh ally of the English kings, was imprisoned here from 1404 to 1412 for attempting to assassinate Owain Glyndŵr. After his release by Glyndŵr, ransomed Gam fought alongside Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt and is named amongst the dead in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;. The name Royal House undoubtedly refers to the tradition that Charles I stayed at the house in 1643.

The weekly market and biannual fair thrived, and in 1613 drew complaints from other towns whose trading in cloth was being severely affected. A document dated 1632 shows that animals for sale came from all over Merionethshire, Montgomeryshire, Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Denbighshire, and prospective buyers came from Flintshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire, Herefordshire and Shropshire, in addition to the above.

The Dyfi Bridge () was first mentioned in 1533, by Geoffrey Hughes, &quot;Citizen and Merchant taylour of London&quot; who left (ten marks) &quot;towards making of a bridge at the toune of Mathanlleth&quot;. By 1601 &quot;Dovey bridge in the Hundred of Mochunleth&quot; was reported to be insufficient, and the current one was built in 1805 for £250. Fenton describes it in 1809 as &quot;A noble erection of five large arches. The piers are narrow and over each cut-water is a pilaster, a common feature of the 18th century&quot;.

Rowland Pugh was the Lord of Meirionedd, and lived at Mathafarn about two miles east of Machynlleth. Pugh supported the Royalist side in the English Civil War. On 2 November 1644, Sir Thomas Myddleton of Chirk Castle was marching on Machynlleth with a force of the Parliamentarian army, when he was ambushed by a force organised by Pugh. In retaliation for the attack, Myddleton burned down Mathafarn on 29 November 1644, along with a number of houses in Machynlleth.

Laura Ashley&#x27;s first shop was opened in Machynlleth (at 35 Maengwyn Street) in 1961.

The disappearance of April Jones in October 2012 received a large amount of coverage in the UK media.

=== , the Londonderry family and the Clock Tower ===
In 1846 Mary Cornelia, the daughter of a local landowner Sir John Edwards married Viscount Seaham, the second son of the third Marquess of Londonderry and they set up home at Plas Machynlleth. Seaham became Earl Vane on the death of his father and the fifth Marquess on the death of his half-brother.

To celebrate the 21st birthday of the Seahams’ eldest son, Viscount Castlereagh, the townspeople paid for the clock tower which stands at the town&#x27;s main road intersection. Erected on the site of the old town hall, it has become the symbol of the town. The foundation stone was laid on 15 July 1874 amid great festivities. The clock tower, designed by Henry Kennedy of Bangor and now a Grade II listed monument, cost £800; the townspeople raised £1,000, of which the remainder was spent planting trees along nearby streets. Meanwhile, a new town hall was erected on the east side of Penrallt Street in 1872; after becoming unsafe, it was demolished in 1968.

Another son, Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest, was the last member of the family to live at the Plas and was killed in the Abermule train collision on the Cambrian Railways, of which he was a director.

The house was given to the townspeople in December 1948 under the stewardship of the then Machynlleth Urban District Council.

====Celtica====
Various local government re-organisations saw responsibility for the Plas pass first to Montgomeryshire District Council, who in 1995 converted it into the Celtica visitor centre. Celtica interpreted the history and culture of the Celts with a walk-through audio-visual exhibition housed in a purpose-built addition to the house. The £3 million attraction was part-funded by the European Union. The centre had a high-profile in the Welsh media, with opera singer Bryn Terfel officially opening the attraction in October 1995.

Powys County Council took over Celtica and the house when it was formed as a unitary authority in 1997. The centre was successful in attracting tourists, school groups and conferences for a number of years; however initial predictions of visitor numbers proved to be too ambitious, and the council was unwilling to prolong its subsidy. With little scope for alternative investment, Celtica closed in March 2006, and the house stood empty while Powys County Council sought to relinquish responsibility for it in line with their policy of selling many of their publicly owned buildings.

On 1 April 2008, in a move thought to be unprecedented for a community council of its size, Machynlleth Town Council took ownership of the Plas and its parkland and facilities. It has reopened the restaurant by leasing it to a local licensee, and the 1st and 2nd floors of the main building are rented out as office space. Medium-sized meeting rooms and conference space are also offered for hire.

== Transport ==
Machynlleth railway station was built by the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway; it provides services to Aberystwyth and the Cambrian coast to the west, and Newtown and Shrewsbury to the east. Services are operated by Transport for Wales.

The town is home to the signalling centre that controls the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) on the Cambrian Line. The system went into full operational use in March 2011.

From 1859 to 1948, the town was served by the narrow-gauge Corris Railway, which brought slate from the quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni for onward despatch to the markets. The railway&#x27;s original station, was on Brickfield Street, and operated from about 1860 to about 1874. It was replaced by a new station, opened in 1874, next to the mainline station. A new station building was built in 1905, and can still be seen alongside the road approaching the town from the north.

Machynlleth is served by two TrawsCymru long-distance bus routes. The T2 connects the town with Bangor to the north and continues to Aberystwyth, where connections can be made to South Wales. There is also the T12 which runs to Wrexham, via Newtown; this is branded as &quot;TrawsCymru Connect&quot;.

== Welsh language ==
Machynlleth retains its linguistic tradition, with Welsh spoken alongside English. The 2011 Census indicated that 67% of the population have some knowledge of Welsh, with 39% able to read, write and speak the language.

== Owain Glyndŵr ==

Machynlleth has a special role in Welsh history because of its connection with Owain Glyndŵr, a Prince of Wales who rebelled against the English during the reign of King Henry IV. Owain was crowned Prince of Wales in 1404 near the Parliament House, which is one of three mediaeval houses in town, in the presence of leaders from Scotland, France and Spain, and he held his own Parliament in the town. He held his last parliament in the nearby village of Pennal, by the Church of St Peter ad Vincula. It is thought that after the rebellion floundered, Owain went into hiding in the area around Machynlleth.

== Tourism and other economic activities==
*Tourism is the primary employment sector with a range of activity based attractions (for example several mountain biking trails) as well as the visitor centre at the Centre for Alternative Technology.
*Agriculture continues to play a significant part in the make-up of the town and surrounding area.

The town has a market on Wednesdays which includes traditional Welsh, Spanish and French food stalls.
The town has hosted the Machynlleth Comedy Festival annually since May 2010, featuring comedians such as Jon Richardson, Pappy&#x27;s, Josie Long, Stewart Lee and Richard Herring. The festival dominates the town for a weekend, with events running over three days in nine venues.

Machynlleth lies on Glyndŵr&#x27;s Way and the Dyfi Valley Way, two long-distance footpaths.

==MoMA Wales==
Machynlleth is the home of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Wales. It originated in 1986 as Y Tabernacl, a centre of performing arts in an old chapel, a private initiative by former journalist Andrew Lambert. In 1994 this was expanded with a new complex of art galleries, a recording studio and a language laboratory. Lambert had previously tried to convert the town&#x27;s old railway station into a hotel and museum, employing international architect Richard Rogers.

MoMA Wales hosts the annual Machynlleth Festival, as well as its own annual open exhibition of art.

==Environment==
Machynlleth is the home of Ecodyfi, a locally controlled organisation that was set up to foster and support a greener community and economy in the Dyfi Valley.

The Centre for Alternative Technology is based in a disused quarry three miles from Machynlleth.

In December 2019 Machynlleth council was the first in Wales to declare a climate emergency.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Machynlleth:
*Machynlleth Town Council at community (town) level. The town council is based at Y Plas and has twelve councillors. In 2019, the town council became the first in Wales to formally support Welsh independence.
*Powys County Council at county level. The ward elects a county councillor. The current county councillor, Michael Williams, was unopposed again at the May 2017 election, but won a contested election in 2022. He had been elected unopposed since first winning the seat in 1980. He had also sat on the Machynlleth Town Council since 1974.

In both the Senedd and the UK House of Commons, Machynlleth sits within the Montgomeryshire constituency, whose MS and MP are Conservatives Russell George and Craig Williams respectively.

===Administrative history===
Machynlleth was an ancient parish in the historic county of Montgomeryshire. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894, the parish was made an urban district. The Machynlleth Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area instead becoming a community. District-level functions passed to Montgomery District Council, which in turn was abolished in 1996 and its functions passed to Powys County Council.

== Sport ==
Machynlleth Town Football Club, founded in 1885, plays in the Spar Mid-Wales district league and the reserve team is in the Cambrian Tyres Division 2 Amateur football league. The Machynlleth Rugby Club plays in the North Wales Division 2.

<text>Royal Docks is an area in the London Borough of Newham in the London Docklands in East London, England.

The area is named after three docks – the Royal Albert Dock, the Royal Victoria Dock and the King George V Dock. They are more correctly called the Royal Group of Docks to distinguish them from the Royal Navy Dockyard, Royal being due to their naming after members of the royal family rather than Crown ownership. The three docks collectively formed the largest enclosed docks in the world, with a water area of nearly and an overall estate of . The area was designated a special enterprise zone in 2012. North Woolwich is part of Royal Docks ward.

Royal Docks was also a ward of the London Borough of Newham, which at the 2011 Census had a population of 10,679. It was abolished for the 2022 elections and replaced by two new wards of Royal Albert and Royal Victoria.

== History ==

The three docks were completed between 1855 and 1921 on riverside marshes in East Ham and West Ham (now the London Borough of Newham). The Victoria and Albert docks were constructed by the London &amp; St Katharine Docks Company, to provide berths for large vessels that could not be accommodated further upriver. They were a great commercial success, becoming London&#x27;s principal docks during the first half of the 20th century. They specialised particularly in the import and unloading of foodstuffs, with rows of giant granaries and refrigerated warehouses being sited alongside the quays. The docks&#x27; great size and provision of numerous finger quays gave them a collective span of over of quaysides, serving hundreds of cargo and passenger ships at a time. Following the opening of the Royal Albert Dock in 1880, giving the Royals access to Gallions Reach, below London Bridge, the rival East &amp; West India Docks Company responded with the construction of Tilbury Docks even further down river. The ruinous competition led eventually to all the enclosed docks being taken over by the Port of London Authority (PLA) in 1909. The PLA completed the King George V Dock in 1921 and reserved land to the north for a fourth dock, never built.
The General Strike of 1926 hit the Royal Docks hard, with 750,000 frozen carcasses threatened by the docks&#x27; electrical supply being cut off. The Royal Navy saved the day for the dock owners by connecting the generators of two submarines to power the warehouses&#x27; freezers.

Although the Royal Docks suffered severe damage from German bombing in World War II, they recovered after the war but suffered a steady decline from the 1960s onwards, following the adoption of containerization. Nonetheless, they survived longer than any of the other upstream docks, finally closing to commercial traffic only in 1981. The docks&#x27; closure led to high levels of unemployment and social deprivation in the surrounding communities of North Woolwich and Silvertown.

== Redevelopment ==
Because of their relative remoteness from central London and poor transport links, the redevelopment of London&#x27;s Docklands has proceeded more slowly in the Royals than in the other former docks. The London Docklands Development Corporation undertook much work during the 1980s and 1990s to improve local transport and promote new residential and commercial developments in the area. Thousands of new homes were built at Beckton, just north of the Royal Docks.

An extension of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) opened in 1994 to provide direct links to the City of London and Canary Wharf. This was later extended round the south side of the docks with the link to London City Airport opening in December 2005. The line was later extended to Woolwich. Crossrail has served the area since 2022.

Several other major projects have been proposed or implemented since then. Many residential complexes have been built; most notably the architecturally progressive Eastern Quay on the south side of Royal Victoria Dock, Capital East on the north side of the dock and the large complex of Gallion&#x27;s Reach in the extreme east of the Royal Docks. A series of major developments have seen the construction of a new university campus (for the University of East London) and the ExCeL Exhibition Centre, among much else. The Royal Docks have also seen the development of London City Airport (code LCY), opened in 1988 on the quay between the Royal Albert Dock and the King George V dock. While the docks themselves have been preserved largely intact, little remains of the old infrastructure, although some historic warehouses and cranes have been preserved.

In 2011 the one hundred and twenty five hectares of the Royal Docks were granted Enterprise Zone status to help attract jobs and businesses to the area.

In 2014, Singapore listed Oxley Holdings together with leading developer Ballymore UK have a Joint-Venture to set up a new waterfront township of Royal Wharf, with 3,385 new homes housing over 10,000. This will be a mixed-use development comprising shops, restaurants and even office complexes. The final phase is known as Mariner&#x27;s Quarter which has the tallest building standing at 19 storeys, overseeing the river Thames and Canary Wharf.

In March 2023, consultants unveiled proposals to use floating modules to create additional dockspace area that could be used to host Formula One motor racing events on a circuit incorporating 2.7km of the existing embankment along the Royal Victoria and Royal Albert Dock from ExCeL to the University of East London.

== Transport ==
Aside from local bus routes, the area is primarily served by the DLR which goes from Canning Town (services west to Canary Wharf and Central London, and North to Stratford) along the north of the dock to Beckton, and along the south of the dock to North Woolwich and under the Thames to Woolwich Arsenal. Transport for London plan to extend the Beckton branch to Dagenham but this is dependent on funding. The DLR replaced the North London Line services that previously served the area from Canning Town to North Woolwich via Custom House and the 600 m Connaught tunnel beneath the docks.

From 2022, a branch of the Elizabeth line passes beneath the Royal Docks between Canning Town and Woolwich in a tunnel, serving Custom House station, with future provision for a station at Silvertown. Crossrail reuses the southern part of the former North London Line alignment from Custom House to North Woolwich (including the Connaught tunnel built in 1878).

There has also been a need for a further river crossing in the area. A long-standing proposal has been for a four-lane tolled bridge providing a road link between Beckton and Thamesmead on the south bank: the Thames Gateway Bridge. A public inquiry on the bridge closed in May 2006, it being particularly contentious in the residential neighbourhoods between Plumstead and the Danson Interchange (a junction on the A2). The plans were shelved, along with the DLR Dagenham extension, by then Mayor of London Boris Johnson when he came to power in 2008. However, in the run-up to the 2012 election, Johnson started to push for a crossing at Silvertown (the western end of the docks).

The Royal Docks is also home to London City Airport, between the northern and southern docks. It was opened in 1988 to serve the Canary Wharf development. It is closer to central London than Heathrow, and is served by a dedicated DLR station. In 2010, London City was the fifth busiest airport in terms of passengers and aircraft movements serving the London area.

== Navigation ==
Although the docks are now closed for commercial shipping, most of the water area of the docks still exists and is still navigable by craft of all sizes up to and including sizeable ships. The docks&#x27; principal use is now water sports, but they do see occasional visits by naval and merchant vessels, especially during the annual London Boat Show and the biennial DSEi arms fair, both of which are held at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre. Cruise ships including Fred Olsen Lines&#x27; Braemar (24,300 GT) were moored there during the London 2012 Olympics.

The management of the water areas of the Royal Docks, including locks and bridges, is now the responsibility of &quot;Royal Docks Management Authority Limited&quot; (RoDMA), which is owned and funded by the owners of the surrounding development land.

<text>News values are &quot;criteria that influence the selection and presentation of events as published news.&quot; These values help explain what makes something &quot;newsworthy.&quot;

News values are not universal and can vary between different cultures. Among the many lists of news values that have been drawn up by scholars and journalists, some attempt to describe news practices across cultures, while others have become remarkably specific to the press of particular (often Western) nations. In the Western tradition, decisions on the selection and prioritization of news are made by editors on the basis of their experience and intuition, although analysis by Johan Galtung and Mari Holmboe Ruge showed that several factors are consistently applied across a range of news organizations. Their theory was tested on the news presented in four different Norwegian newspapers from the Congo and Cuban crisis of July 1960 and the Cyprus crisis of March–April 1964. Results were mainly consistent with their theory and hypotheses. Galtung later said that the media have misconstrued his work and become far too negative, sensational, and adversarial.

Methodologically and conceptually, news values can be approached from four different perspectives: material (focusing on the material reality of events), cognitive (focusing on people&#x27;s beliefs and value systems), social (focusing on journalistic practice), and discursive (focusing on the discourse). A discursive perspective tries to systematically examine how news values such as negativity, proximity, eliteness, and others, are constructed through words and images in published news stories. This approach is influenced by linguistics and social semiotics, and is called &quot;discursive news values analysis&quot; (DNVA). It focuses on the &quot;distortion&quot; step in Galtung and Ruge&#x27;s chain of news communication, by analysing how events are discursively constructed as newsworthy.

== History ==
Initially labelled &quot;news factors,&quot; news values are widely credited to Johan Galtung and Mari Holmboe Ruge. In their seminal 1965 study, Galtung and Ruge put forward a system of twelve factors describing events that together are used as defining &quot;newsworthiness.&quot; Focusing on newspapers and broadcast news, Galtung and Ruge devised a list describing what they believed were significant contributing factors as to how the news is constructed. They proposed a &quot;chain of news communication,&quot; which involves processes of selection (the more an event satisfies the &quot;news factors,&quot; the more likely it is selected as news), distortion (accentuating the newsworthy factors of the event, once it has been selected), and replication (selection and distortion are repeated at all steps in the chain from event to reader). Furthermore, three basic hypotheses are presented by Galtung and Ruge: the additivity hypothesis that the more factors an event satisfies, the higher the probability that it becomes news; the complementary hypothesis that the factors will tend to exclude each other; and the exclusion hypothesis that events that satisfy none or very few factors will not become news.

In 2001, the influential 1965 study was updated by Tony Harcup and Deirdre O&#x27;Neill, in a study of the British press. The findings of a content analysis of three major national newspapers in the UK were used to critically evaluate Galtung and Ruge&#x27;s original criteria and to propose a contemporary set of news values. Forty years on, they found some notable differences, including the rise of celebrity news and that good news (as well as bad news) was a significant news value, as well as the newspaper&#x27;s own agenda. They examined three tabloid newspapers.

== Contemporary news values ==
In a rapidly evolving market, achieving relevance, giving audiences the news they want and find interesting, is an increasingly important goal for media outlets seeking to maintain market share. This has made news organizations more open to audience input and feedback, and forced them to adopt and apply news values that attract and keep audiences. Given these changes and the rapid rise of digital technology in recent years, Harcup and O’Neill updated their 2001 study in 2016, while other scholars have analysed news values in viral news shared via social media. The growth of interactive media and citizen journalism is fast altering the traditional distinction between news producer and passive audience and may in future lead to a redefinition of what &quot;news&quot; means and the role of the news industry.

== List of news values ==
A variety of external and internal pressures influence journalistic decisions during the news-making process, which can sometimes lead to bias or unethical reporting. Many different factors have the potential to influence whether an event is first noticed by a news organisation, second whether a story will be written about that event, third, how that story is written, and fourth whether this story will end up being published as news and if so, where it is placed. Therefore, &quot;there is no end to lists of news criteria.&quot; There are multiple competing lists of news values (including Galtung &amp; Ruge&#x27;s news factors, and others put forward by Schlesinger, Bell, Bednarek &amp; Caple), with considerable overlap but also disagreement as to what should be included.

News values can relate to aspects of events and actors, or to aspects of news gathering and processing:

&quot;Values in news actors and events:&quot;

*Frequency: Events that occur suddenly and fit well with the news organization&#x27;s schedule are more likely to be reported than those that occur gradually or at inconvenient times of day or night. Long-term trends are not likely to receive much coverage.
*Timeliness: Events that have only just happened, are current, ongoing, or are about to happen are newsworthy.
*Familiarity: To do with people or places close to the target audience. Others prefer the term for this news value, which includes geographical and cultural proximity (see &quot;meaningfulness&quot;).
*Negativity: Bad news is more newsworthy than good news. Sometimes described as &quot;the basic news value.&quot; Conversely, it has also been suggested that Positivity is a news value in certain cases (such as sports news, science news, feel-good tabloid stories).
*Conflict: Opposition of people or forces resulting in a dramatic effect. Events with conflict are often quite newsworthy. Sometimes included in Negativity rather than listed as a separate news value.
*Unexpectedness: Events that are out of the ordinary, unexpected, or rare are more newsworthy than routine, unsurprising events.
*Unambiguity: Events whose implications are clear make for better copy than those that are open to more than one interpretation, or where any understanding of the implications depends on first understanding the complex background in which the events take place.
*Personalization: Events that can be portrayed as the actions of individuals will be more attractive than one in which there is no such &quot;human interest.&quot; Personalization is about whether an event can be contextualised in personal terms (affecting or involving specific, &quot;ordinary&quot; people, not the generalised masses).
*Meaningfulness: This relates to the sense of identification the audience has with the topic. &quot;Cultural proximity&quot; is a factor here—events concerned with people who speak the same language, look the same, and share the same preoccupations as the audience receive more coverage than those concerned with people who speak different languages, look different and have different preoccupations. A related term is Relevance, which is about the relevance of the event as regards the target readers/viewers own lives or how close it is to their experiences. Impact refers more generally to an event&#x27;s impact, on the target audience, or on others. An event with significant consequences (high impact) is newsworthy.
*Eliteness: Events concerned with global powers receive more attention than those concerned with less influential nations. Events concerned with the rich, powerful, famous and infamous get more coverage. Also includes the eliteness of sources – sometimes called Attribution.
*Superlativeness: Events with a large scale or scope or with high intensity are newsworthy.
*Consonance: Events that fit with the media&#x27;s expectations and preconceptions receive more coverage than those that defy them (and for which they are thus unprepared). Note this appears to conflict with unexpectedness above. However, consonance really refers to the media&#x27;s &quot;readiness&quot; to report an item. Consonance has also been defined as relating to editors&#x27; stereotypes and their mental scripts for how events typically proceed.

&quot;Values in the news process:&quot;

*Continuity: A story that is already in the news gathers a kind of inertia. This is partly because the media organizations are already in place to report the story, and partly because previous reportage may have made the story more accessible to the public (making it less ambiguous).
*Composition: Stories must compete with one another for space in the media. For instance, editors may seek to provide a balance of different types of coverage, so that if there is an excess of foreign news for instance, the least important foreign story may have to make way for an item concerned with the domestic news. In this way the prominence given to a story depends not only on its own news values but also on those of competing stories.
*Competition: Commercial or professional competition between media may lead journalists to endorse the news value given to a story by a rival.
*Co-option: A story that is only marginally newsworthy in its own right may be covered if it is related to a major running story.
*Prefabrication: A story that is marginal in news terms but written and available may be selected ahead of a much more newsworthy story that must be researched and written from the ground up.
*Predictability: An event is more likely to be covered if it has been pre-scheduled.
*Story impact: The impact of a published story (not the event), for example whether it is being shared widely (sometimes called Shareability), read, liked, commented-on. To be qualified as shareable, a story arguably has to be simple, emotional, unexpected and triggered. Engaging with such analytics is now an important part of newsroom practice.
*Time constraints: Traditional news media such as radio, television and daily newspapers have strict deadlines and a short production cycle, which selects for items that can be researched and covered quickly.
*Logistics: Although eased by the availability of global communications even from remote regions, the ability to deploy and control production and reporting staff, and functionality of technical resources can determine whether a story is covered.
*Data: Media need to back up all of their stories with data in order to remain relevant and reliable. Reporters prefer to look at raw data in order to be able to take an unbiased perspective. An alternative term is Facticity – the favouring of facts and figures in hard news.

One of the key differences in relation to these news values is whether they relate to events or stories. For example, composition and co-option both relate to the published news story. These are news values that concern how news stories fit with the other stories around them. The aim here is to ensure a balanced spread of stories with minimal duplication across a news program or edition. Such news values are qualitatively different from news values that relate to aspects of events, such as Eliteness (the elite status of news actors or sources) or Proximity (the closeness of the event&#x27;s location to the target audience).

== Audience perceptions of news ==

Conventional models concentrate on what the journalist perceives as news. But the news process is a two-way transaction, involving both news producer (the journalist) and the news receiver (the audience), although the boundary between the two is rapidly blurring with the growth of citizen journalism and interactive media. Little has been done to define equivalent factors that determine audience perception of news. This is largely because it would appear impossible to define a common factor, or factors, that generate interest in a mass audience. Basing his judgement on many years as a newspaper journalist Hetherington states that: &quot;...anything which threatens people&#x27;s peace, prosperity and well being is news and likely to make headlines.&quot;

Whyte-Venables suggests audiences may interpret news as a risk signal. Psychologists and primatologists have shown that apes and humans constantly monitor the environment for information that may signal the possibility of physical danger or threat to the individual&#x27;s social position. This receptiveness to risk signals is a powerful and virtually universal survival mechanism. A &quot;risk signal&quot; is characterized by two factors, an element of change (or uncertainty) and the relevance of that change to the security of the individual. The same two conditions are observed to be characteristic of news. The news value of a story, if defined in terms of the interest it carries for an audience, is determined by the degree of change it contains and the relevance that change has for the individual or group. Analysis shows that journalists and publicists manipulate both the element of change and relevance (&#x27;security concern&#x27;) to maximize, or some cases play down, the strength of a story.

Security concern is proportional to the relevance of the story for the individual, his or her family, social group and societal group, in declining order. At some point there is a Boundary of Relevance, beyond which the change is no longer perceived to be relevant, or newsworthy. This boundary may be manipulated by journalists, power elites and communicators seeking to encourage audiences to exclude, or embrace, certain groups: for instance, to distance a home audience from the enemy in time of war, or conversely, to highlight the plight of a distant culture so as to encourage support for aid programs.

In 2018, Hal Pashler and Gail Heriot published a study showing that perceptions of newsworthiness tend to be contaminated by a political usefulness bias. In other words, individuals tend to view stories that give them &quot;ammunition&quot; for their political views as more newsworthy. They give credence to their own views.

== Evolutionary perspectives ==
An evolutionary psychology explanation for why negative news have a higher news value than positive news starts with the empirical observation that the human perceptive system and lower level brain functions have difficulty distinguishing between media stimuli and real stimuli. These lower level brain mechanisms which function on a subconscious level make basic evaluations of perceptive stimuli, focus attention on important stimuli, and start basic emotional reactions. Research has also found that the brain differentiates between negative and positive stimuli and reacts quicker and more automatically to negative stimuli which are also better remembered. This likely has evolutionary explanations with it often being important to quickly focus attention on, evaluate, and quickly respond to threats. While the reaction to a strong negative stimulus is to avoid, a moderately negative stimulus instead causes curiosity and further examination. Negative media news is argued to fall into the latter category which explains their popularity. Lifelike audiovisual media are argued to have particularly strong effects compared to reading.

Women have on average stronger avoidance reactions to moderately negative stimuli. Men and women also differ on average in how they enjoy, evaluate, remember, comprehend, and identify with the people in news depending on if the news are negatively or positively framed. The stronger avoidance reaction to moderately negative stimuli has been explained as it being the role of men in evolutionary history to investigate and potentially respond aggressively to threats while women and children withdrew. It has been claimed that negative news are framed according to male preferences by the often male journalists who cover such news and that a more positive framing may attract a larger female audience. However, other scholars have urged caution as regards evolutionary psychology&#x27;s claims about gender differences.

<text>NAC Breda (), often simply known as NAC, is a Dutch professional football club, based in Breda, Netherlands. NAC Breda play in the Rat Verlegh Stadium, named after their most important player, Antoon &#x27;Rat&#x27; Verlegh. They play in the Eredivisie, after winning play-offs for promotion in 2024. In their history, NAC won one national title in 1921 and won one Cup in 1973.

NAC was founded on 19 September 1912, when the two clubs ADVENDO and NOAD merged to one club, both being abbreviations of their respective full names.

In 2012 Stefaan Eskes succeeded Ed Busselaar and in August 2012 NAC Breda reinstated their first logo as the new club logo for the 2012–13 season.

==Name and etymology==
NAC is a fusion of the two abbreviations of the two clubs that merged to create it in 1912, NOAD and ADVENDO.

NOAD is a Dutch abbreviation for Nooit Opgeven, Altijd Doorzetten&quot; (English translation: &quot;Never give up, always persevere&quot;), while ADVENDO is a Dutch abbreviation for Aangenaam Door Vermaak En Nuttig Door Ontspanning&quot; (English: &quot;Pleasant for its entertainment and useful for its relaxation&quot;). The C stands for &quot;Combinatie&quot; (combination).

The full name of NAC Breda expands to &quot;Nooit opgeven altijd doorzetten, Aangenaam door vermaak en nuttig door ontspanning, Combinatie Breda&quot; ().

Early in 2003 NAC added Breda to their club name as a symbol of gratitude after the City of Breda bought NAC&#x27;s Rat Verleghstadium to help the club cope with financial problems.

==History==

===Foundation===

NAC Breda was founded on 19 September 1912 when the clubs ADVENDO and NOAD merged. During the new club&#x27;s foundation meeting the atmosphere became tense, since NOAD wanted to name the new club NOAD (NOad and ADvendo). This name was not acceptable to ADVENDO and eventually Frans Konert proposed to call the club NAC (NOAD ADVENDO Combinatie), which was accepted by the meeting&#x27;s attendants. At first, the NVB refused to let NAC play association football, but on 28 October 1912 allowed NAC to play in the 2nd Southern Division.

===NAC&#x27;s golden ages===

The first years were not very successful for NAC, but after moving to a new stadium &#x27;t Ploegske, results improved. NAC became one of the top teams in the top Southern Division, becoming champions of the 1919 season, earning NAC the right to play the Dutch Champions&#x27; Competition (a small competition in which the champions from the regional divisions would play for the Dutch title). In this competition, NAC finished in last place. In 1920, NAC were one of the first clubs to play international matches. NAC played a couple of friendly matches, including a match against Real Madrid CF, winning 4-0 and the Spanish newspapers called NAC &#x27;Los muchachos del Breda, maestros del futbol&#x27; (English: The boys from Breda, masters in football). In 1921, NAC celebrated one of its greatest achievements, becoming Dutch football champions. In the Dutch Championship competition, NAC defeated Ajax, Be Quick 1887 and Go Ahead. NAC continued to excel, being considered to be one of the best clubs in Dutch football during the 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s. During this period they won 6 Southern Division titles and their play style was deemed technically perfect by press and the public.

Because of this view, the NAC board decided to hire a professional trainer. Englishman Ben Affleck was hired as a coach and was a couple of months later was succeeded by James Moore. After Moore resigned, the NAC board issued a committee, who would select the best 11 NAC players to play in a match. In 1931 Antoon Verlegh retired from football. Verlegh, nowadays a club icon for NAC, played for them since their foundation. In this year, NAC also had a dispute with the city of Breda. The stadium&#x27;s terrain &#x27;t Ploegske was classed as a residential area, meaning NAC had to leave the ground. As no other option was available in Breda, NAC were forced to move to the town Princenhage. Within two months, a complete new stadium, with a capacity of 5,500 people, was built and NAC left Breda. In 1935, NAC became the first club in the Netherlands to travel via airplane to an away match against GVAV.

In 1939, NAC and Breda reopened discussions on whether they could return to the city. Breda&#x27;s council zoned a large piece of land at the Beatrixstraat as stadium area and NAC returned to Breda in 1940. Because of the breakout of the Second World War, NAC decided to play an important social function in Breda&#x27;s community. In order to divert the people&#x27;s attention from war, NAC organized sport events, theatre, fairs and horsing games. Although NAC continued to play football, several players were employed by the Germans in Germany. During the Second World War, youngster Kees Rijvers made his debut for NAC.

===Challenging times===
After the Second World War, NAC played in the highest level. In 1949 Chairman of Honour C.J. Asselbergs died. Asselbergs was one of the people who were present at NAC since NAC got founded. In 1954 professional football was introduced in the Netherlands. The running competitions were postponed and new competitions were created. NAC entered the 1A League and became champions of this league in 1955. In the championship competition NAC finished second place, behind their rivals Willem II Tilburg.

On 14 March 1960 Breda was shocked to hear the death of Antoon &#x27;De Rat&#x27; Verlegh. Verlegh, considered to be one of the important persons in Dutch football, died in a car accident on 12 March. From NAC&#x27;s foundation in 1912, Verlegh was involved in the club at numerous positions and played an important role with the Royal Dutch Football Association. In November 1961 NAC lost another important person; Chairman Jacques Piederiet died. A year later, in August 1962, chairman Le Fevre died. The beginning of the sixties were not bright for NAC. In 1964–1965 NAC even relegated for the first time in its existence.

The relegation meant a total reconstruction of the club&#x27;s management. The board resigned and NAC&#x27;s intention was to return to the highest level within one year. NAC was successful in this and a season later NAC played in the highest level and a year later qualified for the KNVB Cup&#x27;s final, where it lost to AFC Ajax. Although NAC lost, the club was allowed to play UEFA Cup. In the UEFA Cup NAC reached the second round, after defeating Floriana FC. In the second round NAC was knocked out by Cardiff City. Although NAC remained in the highest football level in the Netherlands, NAC were in a heavy struggle not to relegate. 31 May 1973 is another highlight in NAC&#x27;s history. In the KNVB Cup final, NAC played NEC Nijmegen. NAC won the Final 2-0. Because of their success, NAC was allowed to play in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In the first round, NAC was knocked out by eventual winners 1. FC Magdeburg.

===The birth of the Avondje NAC===
In 1975 the NAC board decided to play the home matches on a Saturday evening. In this period a group of fanatic NAC fans merged and located themselves on a stand. Their fierce support lead to an attraction of youngsters, who also fanatically support NAC. This fierce support lasts till now and is known in the Netherlands as an Avondje NAC (English; An Evening NAC). An Avondje NAC is a flamboyant mix of Burgundian fun, beer, fanaticism and love for the club and ensures that during home matches the atmosphere in the stadium is intimidating. On 6 October 1979, a strange situation occurred. During the home match against NAC&#x27;s rivals Feyenoord the linesman was hit by an ashtray. The referee postponed the match, riots broke out and the incident in the Netherlands is known as the &#x27;Ashtray Incident&#x27;.

In the eighties NAC relegated two times. After the second relegation, it appeared the financial situation of NAC was terrible. NAC was almost bankrupt and had to sell its belongings to survive. For years NAC struggled to survive, but at the end of the eighties NAC&#x27;s situation improved and the club began to play in the top of the Eerste Divisie. On 7 June 1989, NAC player Andro Knel died in a plane accident. It was a shock to the club, especially since Knel was one of the popular players. Hundreds of fans of both NAC Breda and Sparta Rotterdam, Knel&#x27;s former club, came together in memorial of Knel. A temporary Knel monument was revealed and the numbers of supporters visiting the monument proved his popularity. Due to the sad moments of Knel&#x27;s death a special relationship between fans of NAC and Sparta was created.

After Knel&#x27;s death, NAC had to continue to play in de Eerste Divisie and three times NAC was close to promote back to the Eredivisie. In 1992, NAC finally promoted to the Eredivisie. With a team managed by Ronald Spelbos and players like John Lammers, Pierre van Hooijdonk, Ton Lokhoff, Fabian Wilnis and John Karelse, NAC played their promotion match in Den Bosch against FC Den Bosch in front of 9,000 NAC fans. The promotion meant a revival of NAC&#x27;s popularity, the stadium was sold out and NAC was supported by thousands of people in away matches. In the away match against their rivals Feyenoord in Rotterdam, NAC was supported by 8,000 people. Due to the popularity, the NAC board announced it would leave the stadium at the Beatrixstraat and it would build a new stadium. Until the movement, NAC continued to play in the highest level, missed qualification for the UEFA Cup several times and reached the semi-finals of the KNVB Cup.

===A new stadium and continuing financial problems===
 In 1996 NAC moved to their new stadium, the FUJIFILM Stadium. With the move NAC indicated it wanted to play in Europe on a regular basis. In 1998, club youngster Dominique Diroux died from a heart attack during a match between the reserve teams of NAC and AZ. NAC&#x27;s new players couldn&#x27;t meet the club&#x27;s raised expectations for a couple of seasons; NAC were even relegated in 1999. After this, it appeared that NAC&#x27;s financial situation was again in peril. In 4 seasons, NAC bought 60 players and the costs of the new stadium exceeded their budget. In order to save the club, the stadium was bought from NAC by investors and Roelant Oltmans was appointed as the team&#x27;s first professional manager. Also, a fans&#x27; council, the first in Holland, was established, where fans have an advisory role that protects NAC&#x27;s culture and defend fan interests. NAC also has a position available to a fan in the board of chairmen.

NAC professionalized and were promoted in 2000 to the Eredivisie. In 2003, NAC qualified for the UEFA Cup, playing two matches against Newcastle United. An estimated 4,300 NAC fans travelled to Newcastle to support their team. In 2003 it appeared NAC again neared bankruptcy, but the City of Breda purchased the stadium again from NAC on 30 January 2003. As gratitude, NAC modified their name to become NAC Breda, honouring the city&#x27;s consistent contributions towards helping the club during difficult times After another financial rescue, the management and the Board of chairmen resigned, being succeeded by Theo Mommers as managing director and a new Board of chairmen, led by Willem van der Hoeven. In 2006 NAC decided to rename the stadium to Rat Verlegh Stadion.

For a long time, NAC&#x27;s financial position appeared stable as the club finished third in the 2007–2008 Eredivisie. In 2009, NAC qualified for the UEFA Europa League. In the 4th round, NAC was defeated by Villarreal CF with scores of 1–3 (home) and 6–1 (away). Despite earlier denials towards fans and stakeholders by management and the Board of chairmen, it appeared at the end of season 2009–2010 that NAC&#x27;s financial position was once again unstable. The club lost €3.2 million that season, due to rebuilding the stadium and buying expensive players. Board members Willem van der Hoeven, Jacques Visschers and Bas Koomans resigned and Bas van Bavel became new chairman. Managing director Theo Mommers reported ill in April 2010. Bernard Ouwerkerk was appointed in June 2010 as the club&#x27;s interim managing director, while Technical Manager Earnest Stewart signed a contract at AZ and was replaced by Jeffrey van As.
During this period, NAC manager Maaskant raised his concerns several times to the press. Because of the financial problems, NAC had to cut its budget, meaning Maaskant was not able to buy new players. On 21 August 2010, NAC and Maaskant made public that the trainer would leave the club for Polish football club Wisła Kraków, where he signed a two-year deal. His assistant managers John Karelse, Gert Aandewiel and Arno van Zwam became the interim managers for NAC Breda. In January 2011, Bernard Ouwerkerk resigned and was succeeded by Ed Busselaar. In March 2011 it appeared that NAC had a debt of €7.1 million.

===Relegation and Eerste Divisie (2015–2017)===
After a few seasons of struggle to stay clear of relegation, NAC couldn&#x27;t avoid relegation after the 2014/15 season, when they were beaten by Roda JC in a promotion/relegation playoff final. They had enjoyed 15 successive seasons in the top tier.

===Return to Eredivisie (2017–present)===
On 28 May 2017, NAC returned to the Eredivisie after winning the promotion/relegation play-off final against NEC Nijmegen (1–0 and 1–4). Cyriel Dessers scored four goals in those two matches. The other goal was made by Giovanni Korte. After the match there were festivities in Breda. First there was a party next to the stadium. A day later the party continued at the &quot;Grote Markt&quot;. On 12 May 2019, in a defeat to SC Heerenveen they relegated to the Keuken Kampioen Divisie but on 2 June 2024 they returned to the Eredivisie after a 5 seasons absence by winning the promotion play-off finals against Excelsior Rotterdam, with a 6-2 win at home and a 4-1 loss away.

==Domestic results==
Below is a table with NAC Breda&#x27;s domestic results since the introduction of the Eredivisie in 1956.

==Colours and crest==

===Colours===
NAC&#x27;s official colours are yellow, white and black. During their existence these colours have always been in NAC&#x27;s home and/or away kit.

Initially, NAC&#x27;s home kit was a black shirt -with a diagonal yellow line-, a white short and yellow black socks. In 1916 NAC changed this kit towards a white shirt. This white shirt would remain till the sixties when NAC decided to replace the white shirt with a yellow shirt and black shorts Conversely, NAC&#x27;s away colours have been very inconsistent. There is no setting in the colour standards.
In NAC cultural manifest it has been stated that the home and away kits should have the official NAC colours. Afterwards, NAC announced to play their home matches in a yellow shirt, with a black diagonal line running over it, black shorts and white socks, with some yellow accents in it. The away kit is a white shirt, with a yellow diagonal line marked by a black border running over it. White short and white socks complete the away kit.

===Crest===
During their existence, NAC had 4 different crests. After their foundation in 1912, their crest was a black shield, with a yellow diagonal line running over it and in it the letters N.A.C.. This crest was replaced in 1968 by another crest. The reason for this crest change is unknown. In 1974 the crest was replaced by a crest which contained the letters NAC in a black and yellow combination. The crest was most probably changed due to the dismissal of the NAC board in 1974. In order to state a new beginning, a new board member&#x27;s daughter designed NAC&#x27;s third crest.

The fourth crest was developed in 1996, when NAC moved to the Rat Verlegh Stadion. It consisted of two lions, three crosses, the letters NAC and it contains NAC&#x27;s official club colours. The two lions and the three crosses are derived from Breda&#x27;s crest. In 2012, the first crest was re-adopted since, as NAC celebrated its 100th anniversary. Eventually upon initiative (and paid for) by the fans it was decided to reinstate the first crest permanently.
==Stadiums==

===BLO Terrein===
&quot;Period: 19 September 1912 – 31 July 1913.&quot;
Directly after the merger of NOAD and ADVENDO, and thus the foundation of NAC, the board rented the fields of the Bond voor Lichaamlijke Opvoeding to play their homematches. The terrain, located east of the Wilhelmina Park in Breda, was NAC&#x27;s homeground for one season. Because of the terrain&#x27;s poor conditions, NAC moved to another terrain.

===Achter de Watertoren===

&quot;Period: 1 August 1913 – 31 July 1916.&quot;
For three seasons NAC played at the grounds known as Achter de Watertoren (English: Behind the watertower), located north of the Wilhelmina Park in Breda. During the seasons NAC played at Achter de Watertoren, NAC&#x27;s popularity increased and the club decided to move for the third time in her existence.

===&#x27;t Ploegske===

&quot;Period: 1 August 1916 – 29 August 1931.&quot;
Without no doubt, NAC&#x27;s biggest successes were at the stadium &#x27;t Ploegske. In 1921 NAC celebrated the Dutch championship at the stadium. &#x27;t Ploegske was the first NAC stadium with stands, and a capacity over 3,000, was located at the Molengracht in Breda. Due to the fact Breda&#x27;s City Council zoned the area as a residential area, NAC were forced to move.

===Heuvelstraat===

&quot;Period: 30 August 1931 – 1 August 1940.&quot;
Due to the City Council&#x27;s decision to zone the grounds of &#x27;t Ploegske as a residential area and the city of Breda had no new grounds available, NAC were forced to move out Breda. The town of Princenhage offered NAC a terrain, where NAC built a state-of-the-art stadium with a capacity of 5,500. The main disadvantage was that the stadium was located far from Breda&#x27;s city centre. Nevertheless, NAC&#x27;s golden decennium in the thirties, when NAC was considered to be one of the top clubs in the Netherlands, took place in the stadium at the Heuvelstraat. In 1939 the city of Breda offered NAC a new terrain at the Beatrixstraat.

===Beatrixstraat===

&quot;Period: 1 August 1940 – 13 May 1996.&quot;
Moving to the Beatrixstraat meant a return to NAC&#x27;s roots. NAC was back in the city where it belonged. NAC&#x27;s popularity increased and in the fifties and sixties NAC was considered to be one of the biggest clubs in the Netherlands. In the seventies NAC became notorious for their evening matches at this stadium. An intimidating and fierce atmosphere lead to the birth of the &#x27;Avondje NAC&#x27; (English: Evening NAC), in which NAC&#x27;s fans fanatically supported their team. The stadium&#x27;s top capacity was 18,500. Due to strict regulations, it was limited to 12,560 in the nineties. Due to the stadium&#x27;s age and overdue maintenance, NAC left the stadium in 1996.

===Rat Verlegh stadium===
&quot;Period: 11 August 1996 – Present.&quot;
NAC&#x27;s current ground is the Rat Verlegh stadium, located 2 kilometres north west of Breda&#x27;s city centre. Founded as the FUJIFILM Stadium, the name was changed in 2003 to the MyCom stadium. From the stadium&#x27;s opening the NAC fans used the name Rat Verlegh stadium, which was officially assigned by NAC to the stadium in 2006. At present, the stadium&#x27;s capacity is 17,750. Due to the increasing popularity of NAC Breda, the stadium was expanded in summer 2010 to a capacity of 19,000.

==Fans==
NAC fans often refer to themselves as The Rats or The Yellow Army. NAC Breda have a loyal fanbase, with virtually all their home matches selling out. National and international NAC is known by the fierce and fanatic support of their fans, combined in the term Avondje NAC (English: &#x27;An evening NAC&#x27;). A flamboyant mix of Burgundian fun, beer, fanaticism and love for the club ensures that during home matches the atmosphere in the stadium is intimidating. The term has its roots in the seventies, when the board decided to play their home matches at a Saturday evening. Nowadays, NAC is supported by two fanatic sides: The B-Side and Vak G. The club&#x27;s fans also publish NAC Fanzine De Rat, named after Antoon &#x27;Rat&#x27; Verlegh. NAC was the first club in Dutch professional soccer to found a fans&#x27; council. This council is an advisory organisation, that protects NAC&#x27;s culture and defend the fans&#x27; interests. NAC also has one position available for a fan in the board of chairmans.

==Rivalries==
NAC Breda&#x27;s longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest neighbour, Willem II from Tilburg. This rivalry originated in the 1920s. Matches between the two are referred to as the derby of Brabant. The two cities of Breda and Tilburg are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that it is city against city with local pride at stake. The cities differ culturally where Tilburg only came into prominence during the industrial revolution as a working class city but Breda having been an important cultural and military hub since at least the late medieval period, being colloquially called the pearl of the south (de parel van het zuiden).

NAC Breda&#x27;s other deep running rivalry is with Rotterdam based club Feyenoord. The rivalry has its roots after several incidents between fans of both clubs in the 1970s. Although Feyenoord fans don&#x27;t have the same rival feelings like NAC fans have, matches against Feyenoord are considered to be of the most important and most violent matches of a season.

<doc id="505175" wikidata="Q505198" url="?curid=505175" title="Songhay languages">
<text>The Songhay, Songhai or Ayneha languages (, or ) are a group of closely related languages/dialects centred on the middle stretches of the Niger River in the West African countries of Mali, Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. In particular, they are spoken in the cities of Timbuktu, Djenné, Niamey, Gao, Tillaberi, Dosso, Parakou, Kandi, Natitingou, Djougou, Malanville, Gorom-Gorom, In-Gall and Tabelbala . They have been widely used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; in that region ever since the era of the Songhai Empire. In Mali, the government has officially adopted the dialect of Gao (east of Timbuktu) as the dialect to be used as a medium of primary education.

Some Songhay languages have little to no mutual intelligibility between each other. For example, Koyraboro Senni, spoken in Gao, is unintelligible to speakers of Zarma in Niger, according to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;. However, Songhoyboro Ciine, Zarma, and Dendi have high mutual intelligibility within Niger.

For linguists, a major point of interest in the Songhay languages has been the difficulty of determining their genetic affiliation; they are commonly taken to be Nilo-Saharan, as defined by Joseph Greenberg in 1963, but this classification remains controversial. Linguist Gerrit Dimmendaal (2008) believes that for now it is best considered an independent language family. Roger Blench argues that the Songhay and Saharan languages form a Songhay-Saharan branch with each other within the wider Nilo-Saharan linguistic phylum.

Historically, the name &quot;Songhay&quot; was neither an ethnic nor a linguistic designation for all, but a name for the ruling caste of the Songhai Empire which are the Songhai proper. The term used by the natives to address the languages and people collectively is Ayneha. Aside from the Songhai proper, some speakers in Mali have also adopted the name Songhay as an ethnic designation, while other Songhay-speaking groups identify themselves with other ethnic terms, such as Zarma (Djerma) or Isawaghen (Sawaq).

A few precolonial poems and letters composed in Songhay and written in the Arabic script exist in Timbuktu. However, Songhay is currently written in the Latin script.

==Varieties==
Researchers classify the Songhay languages into two main branches; Southern and Northern. Southern Songhay is centered on the Niger River. Zarma (Djerma), the most widely spoken Songhay language with two or three million speakers, is a major language of southwestern Niger (downriver from and south of Mali) including in the capital city, Niamey. Koyraboro Senni, with 400,000 speakers, is the language of the town of Gao, the seat of the old Songhai Empire. Koyra Chiini is spoken to its west. The much smaller Northern Songhay is a group of heavily Berber-influenced dialects spoken in the Sahara. Since the Berber influence extends beyond the lexicon into the inflectional morphology, the Northern Songhay languages are sometimes viewed as mixed languages.

==Genetic affiliation==

Diedrich Hermann Westermann, a missionary and linguist, hesitated between assigning it to Gur or considering it an isolate, and Maurice Delafosse grouped it with Mande. At present, Songhay is normally considered to be Nilo-Saharan, following Joseph Greenberg&#x27;s 1963 reclassification of African languages; Greenberg&#x27;s argument is based on about 70 claimed cognates, including pronouns. This proposal has been developed further by, in particular, Lionel Bender, who saw it as an independent subfamily of Nilo-Saharan. Roger Blench notes that Songhay shares the defining singulative–plurative morphology typical of Nilo-Saharan languages. As of 2011, he believes that Songhay is closest to the neighboring Saharan languages and is not divergent.

However, a Nilo-Saharan classification is controversial. Greenberg&#x27;s argument was subjected to serious criticism by Lacroix, who deemed only about 30 of Greenberg&#x27;s claimed cognates acceptable, and moreover argued that these held mainly between Zarma and the Saharan languages, thus leading one to suspect them of being loanwords. Certain Songhay–Mande similarities have long been observed (at least since Westermann), and Mukarovsky (1966), Denis Creissels (1981) and Nicolaï (1977, 1984) investigated the possibility of a Mande relationship; Creissels made some 50 comparisons, including many body parts and morphological suffixes (such as the causative in &quot;-endi&quot;), while Nicolaï claimed some 450 similar words as well as some conspicuous typological traits. However, Nicolaï eventually concluded that this approach was not adequate, and in 1990 proposed a distinctly novel hypothesis: that Songhay is a Berber-based creole language, restructured under Mande influence. In support of this he proposed 412 similarities, ranging all the way from basic vocabulary (&quot;tasa&quot; &quot;liver&quot;) to obvious borrowings (&quot;anzad&quot; &quot;violin&quot;, &quot;alkaadi&quot; &quot;qadi&quot;.) Others, such as Gerrit Dimmendaal, were not convinced, and Nicolaï (2003) appears to consider the question of Songhay&#x27;s origins still open, while arguing against Bender&#x27;s proposed etymologies.

Greenberg&#x27;s morphological similarities with Nilo-Saharan include the personal pronouns &quot;ai&quot; (cf. Zaghawa &quot;ai&quot;), &#x27;I&#x27;, &quot;ni&quot; (cf. Kanuri &quot;nyi&quot;), &#x27;you (sg.)&#x27;, &quot;yer&quot; (e.g. Kanuri &quot;-ye&quot;), &#x27;we&#x27;, &quot;wor&quot; (cf. Kanuri &quot;-wi&quot;), &#x27;you (pl.)&#x27;; relative and adjective formants &quot;-ma&quot; (e.g. Kanuri &quot;-ma&quot;) and &quot;-ko&quot; (cf. Maba &quot;-ko&quot;), a plural suffix &quot;-an&quot; (?), a hypothetical plural suffix &quot;-r&quot; (cf. Teso &quot;-r&quot;) which he takes to appear in the pronouns &quot;yer&quot; and &quot;wor&quot;, intransitive/passive &quot;-a&quot; (cf. Teso &quot;-o&quot;).

The most striking of the Mande similarities listed by Creissels are the third person pronouns &quot;a&quot; sg. (pan-Mande &quot;a&quot;), &quot;i&quot; pl. (pan-Mande &quot;i&quot; or &quot;e&quot;), the demonstratives &quot;wo&quot; &quot;this&quot; (cf. Manding &quot;o&quot;, &quot;wo&quot;) and &quot;no&quot; &quot;there&quot; (cf. Soninke &quot;no&quot;, other Mande &quot;na&quot;), the negative &quot;na&quot; (found in a couple of Manding dialects) and negative perfect &quot;mana&quot; (cf. Manding &quot;má&quot;, &quot;máŋ&quot;), the subjunctive &quot;ma&quot; (cf. Manding &quot;máa&quot;), the copula &quot;ti&quot; (cf. Bisa &quot;ti&quot;, Manding &quot;de/le&quot;), the verbal connective &quot;ka&quot; (cf. Manding &quot;kà&quot;), the suffixes &quot;-ri&quot; (resultative – cf. Mandinka &quot;-ri&quot;, Bambara &quot;-li&quot; process nouns), &quot;-ncè&quot; (ethnonymic, cf. Soninke &quot;-nke&quot;, Mandinka &quot;-nka&quot;), &quot;-anta&quot; (ordinal, cf. Soninke &quot;-ndi&quot;, Mandinka &quot;-njaŋ&quot;...), &quot;-anta&quot; (resultative participle, cf. Soninke &quot;-nte&quot;), &quot;-endi&quot; (causative, cf. Soninke, Mandinka &quot;-ndi&quot;), and the postposition &quot;ra&quot; &quot;in&quot; (cf. Manding &quot;lá&quot;, Soso &quot;ra&quot;...)

The Songhay languages are considered to be an independent family by Dimmendaal (2011), although he classifies Saharan as part of Nilo-Saharan.

==Grammar==
Songhay is mostly a tonal, SOV group of languages, an exception being the divergent Koyra Chiini of Timbuktu, which is non-tonal and uses SVO order.

Songhay has a morpheme &quot;-ndi&quot; which marks either the causative or the agentless passive. Verbs can even take two instances of the morpheme, one for each meaning. Thus &quot;ŋa-ndi-ndi&quot; figuratively translates to &quot;[the rice] was made to be eaten [by someone: causee] [by someone: causer]&quot;.

<doc id="505176" wikidata="Q379168" url="?curid=505176" title="Correspondence theory of truth">
<text>In metaphysics and philosophy of language, the correspondence theory of truth states that the truth or falsity of a statement is determined only by how it relates to the world and whether it accurately describes (i.e., corresponds with) that world. 

Correspondence theories claim that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs. This type of theory attempts to posit a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or facts on the other.

== History ==
Correspondence theory is a traditional model which goes back at least to some of the ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined solely by how it relates to a reality; that is, by whether it accurately describes that reality. As Aristotle claims in his &quot;Metaphysics&quot;: &quot;To say that that which is, is not, and that which is not, is, is a falsehood; therefore, to say that which is, is, and that which is not, is not, is true&quot;.

A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the medieval philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas: &quot;Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus&quot; (&quot;Truth is the adequation of things and intellect&quot;), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth-century Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli.

Correspondence theory was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the early modern thinkers, including René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. (However, Spinoza and Kant have also been [mis]interpreted as defenders of the coherence theory of truth.) Correspondence theory has also been attributed to Thomas Reid.

In late modern philosophy, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling espoused the correspondence theory. According to Bhikhu Parekh, Karl Marx also subscribed to a version of the correspondence theory.

In contemporary Continental philosophy, Edmund Husserl defended the correspondence theory. In contemporary analytic philosophy, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein (at least in his early period), J. L. Austin, and Karl Popper defended the correspondence theory.

== Varieties ==
=== Correspondence as congruence ===
Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein have in different ways suggested that a statement, to be true, must have some kind of structural isomorphism with the state of affairs in the world that makes it true. For example, &quot;A cat is on a mat&quot; is true if, and only if, there is in the world a cat and a mat and the cat is related to the mat by virtue of being on it. If any of the three pieces (the cat, the mat, and the relation between them which correspond respectively to the subject, object, and verb of the statement) is missing, the statement is false. Some sentences pose difficulties for this model, however. As just one example, adjectives such as &quot;counterfeit&quot;, &quot;alleged&quot;, or &quot;false&quot; do not have the usual simple meaning of restricting the meaning of the noun they modify: a &quot;tall lawyer&quot; is a kind of lawyer, but an &quot;alleged lawyer&quot; may not be.

=== Correspondence as correlation ===
J. L. Austin theorized that there need not be any structural parallelism between a true statement and the state of affairs that makes it true. It is only necessary that the semantics of the language in which the statement is expressed are such as to correlate whole-for-whole the statement with the state of affairs. A false statement, for Austin, is one that is correlated by the language to a state of affairs that does not exist.

== Relation to ontology ==
Historically, most advocates of correspondence theories have been metaphysical realists; that is, they believe that there is a world external to the minds of all humans. This is in contrast to metaphysical idealists who hold that everything that exists, exists as a substantial metaphysical entity independently of the individual thing of which it is predicated, and also to conceptualists who hold that everything that exists is, in the end, just an idea in some mind. However, it is not strictly necessary that a correspondence theory be married to metaphysical realism. It is possible to hold, for example, that the facts of the world determine which statements are true and to also hold that the world (and its facts) is but a collection of ideas in the mind of some supreme being.

== Objections ==
One attack on the theory claims that the correspondence theory succeeds in its appeal to the real world only in so far as the real world is reachable by us.

The direct realist believes that we directly know objects as they are. Such a person can wholeheartedly adopt a correspondence theory of truth.

The rigorous idealist believes that there are no real, mind-independent objects. The correspondence theory appeals to imaginary undefined entities, so it is incoherent.

Other positions hold that we have some type of awareness, perception, etc. of real-world objects which in some way falls short of direct knowledge of them. But such an indirect awareness or perception is itself an idea in one&#x27;s mind, so that the correspondence theory of truth reduces to a correspondence between ideas about truth and ideas of the world, whereupon it becomes a coherence theory of truth.

=== Vagueness or circularity === 
Either the defender of the correspondence theory of truth offers some accompanying theory of the world, or they do not.

If no theory of the world is offered, the argument is so vague as to be useless or even unintelligible: truth would then be supposed to be correspondence to some undefined, unknown or ineffable world.
It would in this case be difficult to see how a candid truth could be more certain than the world we are to judge its degree of correspondence against.

On the other hand, as soon as the defender of the correspondence theory of truth offers a theory of the world, they are operating in some specific ontological or scientific theory, which stands in need of justification.
But, the only way to support the truth of this world-theory that is allowed by the correspondence theory of truth, is correspondence to the real world. Hence the argument is inescapably circular.

<doc id="505177" wikidata="Q601244" url="?curid=505177" title="Guile (Street Fighter)">
<text>is a fictional character from Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series of fighting games. He debuted as one of the original eight World Warriors in 1991&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and appeared in the game&#x27;s subsequent updates. In the games he is portrayed as a pilot in the United States Air Force who is seeking to avenge the death of his Air Force buddy Charlie at the hands of the villainous dictator M. Bison. He started out as a major of the Air Force, until he is promoted to a colonel rank in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;.

One of the most popular characters in the series, Guile has appeared in other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games, including the home port versions of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; (where he is a playable character alongside Charlie), and &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;. He is also a playable character in various spin-off titles, such as the &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot;, and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series.

Guile has also appeared in other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; media: the main protagonist in the 1994 live-action &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film and its animated spin-off, as well as one of the main characters in &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;. The character has also been featured in various official comics and merchandise. His music theme, known simply as &quot;Guile&#x27;s Theme&quot;, has been used multiple times, usually to give a sense of victory.

Guile has been perceived as unique among &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; characters in both appearance and gameplay. He is noted as having only two signature moves in the game, both of which are performed by first holding a direction on the joystick and then pushing in the opposite direction with a punch or kick - the Sonic Boom and the Flash Kick, respectively. Guile has been well received, with the character often placing highly in various lists of the best &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters of all time.

==Conception and design==
Early &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; sketches and notes suggest that Guile was developed specifically to appeal to American fans. In an interview with &quot;Game On!&quot;, Capcom Research and Design head Noritaka Funamizu stated that of the more popular characters in the series with western audiences, Guile was most likely considered the game&#x27;s main character. Guile&#x27;s design and hairstyle is based on Rudol von Stroheim and Jean-Pierre Polnareff, characters from the manga &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;. Guile&#x27;s name is not a reference to The J. Geils Band, whose name was also referenced in JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure. 

==Appearances==

===In video games===
Guile was first introduced in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991) as one of the eight selectable characters featured in the first release of the game. The former elite SOF teammate from the United States, Guile along with his best friend and co-pilot Charlie Nash were missing in action during a mission in Shadaloo. In his ending, he defeats Bison and lifts him on his knees by his throat to finish him off just after reminding him of who he murdered, but is dissuaded from killing him by his wife Julia (Jane in Japan) and their daughter Amy (Chris in Japan and &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;), he then spares the bruised and bloody Bison and returns to his country to spend his family.

Guile&#x27;s returns in console versions of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; (1998) as an Air Force JTAC ordered to track down Charlie, who has gone missing. In his ending, Charlie holds off Bison while Guile escapes and the base explodes with Charlie still in it, resulting in his death.

Guile also appears as a playable character in &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; (1997) and its two sequels, &quot;Street Fighter EX2&quot; (1998) and &quot;Street Fighter EX3&quot; (2000). His relationship with Ken as brothers-in-law (with their respective wives being sisters) is mentioned for the first time in the games in Ken&#x27;s ending in the Japanese version of the original &quot;EX2&quot;.

Guile returns as a playable character in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; (2008), Guile investigates S.I.N. and their connection to Shadaloo. In his Street Fighter IV ending, Guile is searching for Chun-Li after he defeats Seth. In &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;″s ending, Guile visits Charlie&#x27;s grave and tells him that Shadaloo&#x27;s plans are not over yet. 

Guile also appears as a supporting character in the crossover fighting game &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; (2012), with Abel as his official tag partner.

Guile returns as the first of the delayed characters in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; (2016–2022), as one of 6 DLC characters. In this game, he is now promoted to a colonel rank. During Shadaloo&#x27;s final scheme under a Black Moon-based Operation C.H.A.I.N.S., Guile suddenly encounters Charlie, who was resurrected by an unknown assailant, and joined the said third party side, despite their motives for Shadaloo&#x27;s downfall are same. After Charlie cures Abel of M. Bison&#x27;s Psycho Power, Guile reconciles with his undead friend. Guile joins the heroes who Karin recruited who join a final assault against the Shadaloo, While Rashid managed to shutdown Shadaloo&#x27;s Operation C.H.A.I.N.S, Guile, Ryu, and Chun-Li watch Charlie a final time where the latter sacrifices his life to weaken M. Bison. Guile decides to retire from fighting to be with his family and become a mentor of the son of late-Robert Sullivan, Luke. 

As Guile was absent from &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, which took place several years after &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, Guile returns in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; (2023), which itself takes place after &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;. Guile returns to his duty to investigate the ongoing conspiracy at Nayshall caused by the Amnesia terrorist organization led by JP, ever since they framed Ken for the crime he did not commit.

Guile appears in both the arcade and home versions of &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;, which were two separately-produced 1995 fighting games that used digitized footage from the live-action &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film, in which Guile was the lead character. Actor Jean-Claude Van Damme posed for Guile&#x27;s animation frames in the game.

The &quot;Alpha 3&quot; incarnation of Guile appears as a selectable character in several fighting game crossovers which including &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; (2000), &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; (2000), &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot; (2001) and &quot;Capcom Fighting Jam&quot; (2003). He also appears in the SNK-produced installments of SNK/Capcom crossovers in &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium&quot; (1999), &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; (2003) and the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; series. A super-deformed version of the character is playable in the mobile puzzle game &quot;Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits&quot; (2014).

Guile appears in Charlie&#x27;s ending in &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; (he is not identified by name, only as &quot;Charlie&#x27;s friend&quot;), swearing revenge on Bison for apparently killing Charlie. A Guile-inspired costume for players to use in Sony&#x27;s &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; was released as downloadable content. Guile appears as an assist trophy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, using Flash Kick and Sonic Boom. Guile was also added to &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, along with Cammy on August 3, 2021. A playable Guile skin will also be added to &quot;Exoprimal&quot;.

The English version of &quot;Saturday Night Slam Masters&quot; implies that the character Gunloc is related to Guile. The video game adaptations of &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot; expand on this, stating that Gunloc is Guile&#x27;s brother.

===In other media===
In the 1994 live-action &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film, going by &quot;William F. Guile&quot;, is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Guile is commanding the A.N. forces as he searches for General M. Bison. His motivation for searching for Bison is not to avenge Charlie&#x27;s death but to end Bison&#x27;s corrupt organization and to rescue Charlie, although he receives a great deal of help to find Bison&#x27;s base, and is aided in his mission. Van Damme was approached to reprise the role in the reboot, &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li&quot;, but ultimately did not appear.

Guile was planned to appear in the second season of &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot;, titled &quot;Street Fighter: World Warrior&quot;; series creator Joey Ansah was interested in casting Scott Adkins as Guile. &quot;World Warrior&quot; was eventually scrapped in favor of &quot;Street Fighter: Resurrection&quot;; Guile was mentioned by Ken in the &quot;Resurrection&quot; episode &quot;Fight &amp; Flight&quot; but did not appear in the series.

Guile is one of the main characters in the 1994 anime film &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, where he is voiced by Masane Tsukayama in the Japanese original and by Kirk Thornton (credited as Donald Lee) in the English dub. Guile, serving as a jet fighter pilot and ranked as a Captain (O-3) in the U.S. Near the end of the film, Guile manages to track Ryu down but is followed by Bison and a brainwashed Ken. Guile engages Bison who finishes the fight by blasting Guile down a chasm. Guile survives this, although exhausted and bloodied, and when Bison finds Guile, he decides to spare him as an insult, and leaves. Guile is rescued along with Balrog by E. Honda. In his final scene, Guile, fully recovered, is moved to tears when informed that Chun-Li survived Vega&#x27;s attack.

Based loosely on the storyline of the 1994 film while combining elements from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Guile serves as the main protagonist of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series, and is depicted as the leader of an organization of Street Fighters consisting of himself and fellow fighters. Bison has survived his battle with Guile following the events of the film, and Guile&#x27;s sole goal is to destroy Bison once and for all. 

Guile appears in the 1995 anime series &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;, where he is voiced by Tesshō Genda in the Japanese original and once again by Kirk Thornton in the English Amimaze dub and by Rob Mungle in the ADV Films dub. In this TV series, Guile is a Master Sergeant (E-7) in the U.S. Air Force, who spends most of his time training physically and who has great pride in the Air Force and motivates Ryu and Ken to imrpove themselves. Later in the series, Guile is recruited by Ken&#x27;s father along with his friend Charlie when Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li are taken captive by Shadaloo. He faces Zangief while infiltrating Bison&#x27;s base. Guile knocks Zangief out, but is unable to save Nash from Bison, who pits a brainwashed Chun-Li against the enraged Sergeant. Outside, Guile fights Chun-Li until Bison&#x27;s demise snaps her out of her brainwashing.

In UDON&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comic adaptation, Guile is given a central role alongside Chun-Li, particularly in the first arc but he also is a frequent cast member in later arcs. Similar to the official story, Guile is chasing after Shadaloo to discover the whereabouts of his Air Force buddy, Charlie Nash. Like the official story, Charlie teaches Guile to fight. For the first arc of the comics, Guile spends his time looking for Ryu, believing to there to be a connection between him and Shadaloo. He traces him to the US and then back to Japan. While in Japan, he and Chun-Li engage a Shadaloo-controlled Charlie (codenamed &quot;Agent Shadow&quot;) and fight him off. At the end of the first story arc, Charlie regains his senses and rejoins Chun-Li and Guile before they&#x27;re attacked by M. Bison. Charlie unleashes his latent Psycho Power abilities and sacrifices himself to take out Bison (Charlie giving his own life to stop Bison echoes Guile&#x27;s ending in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;), leaving Guile distraught and swearing vengeance against Shadaloo. Afterwards, Guile continues to assist Chun-Li in looking for Bison (whom they believe survived his encounter with Charlie) but all the while juggling his struggling relationship with his wife, Julia, and their daughter, Amy. Eventually the family reconciles at the end of the comic&#x27;s second arc. Guile isn&#x27;t heavily active during the second series of comics (&quot;Street Fighter II&quot;) but he is given an invitation to Bison&#x27;s tournament, which he accepts as his final bid for vengeance. The final series (&quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;) documents Guile&#x27;s entry into M. Bison&#x27;s fighting tournament. While on Shadaloo island, he is contacted by Cammy, who needs his help but cannot openly assist him as she is attempting to fool Bison into thinking she is under his control. Through a carefully woven set of scripted matches, Guile and Chun-Li get themselves eliminated from the tournament and successfully free the Delta Red squadron. Together they manage to locate and destroy Bison&#x27;s Psycho Drive before evacuating the island as it sinks. The aftermath of the tournament show that Guile is satisfied with the results, believing he has successfully avenged Charlie, and is now comfortably living with his family.

Guile also appears alongside other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters in the Archie Comics crossover event &quot;Worlds Unite&quot;, which featured various Capcom and Sega franchises guest-starring in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Universe, Mega Man&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; comics.

==Reception==

Since his introduction, Guile has been positively received, ranking 4th in &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of Best Characters introduced in 1991. &quot;IGN&quot;″s D. F. Smith stated that while &quot;there&#x27;s nothing too fancy about him. He&#x27;s just your basic, no-nonsense, all-American tough guy&quot;, his unique hairstyle and aesthetics helped give him enough personality to stand out. In another article for the website, he argued that the image of an &quot;American soldier&quot; is often the first that comes to mind for the Japanese, and felt of the whole cast the most like a &quot;regular guy&quot; in many ways. He voiced some disdain for how different the character was in the live action film, noting that despite Van Damme being a good fit physically, the rest of the aspects deviated too far. &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Gavin Jasper praised Guile&#x27;s backstory of revenge, and how the cost of his &quot;soul&quot; in the metaphorical sense helped make the conclusion of his story in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; one of the best in video games overall. He further argued that compared to Chun-Li&#x27;s own story of revenge, his was more compelling, stating &quot;he has actual issues to work through&quot;.

Nicholas Ware in a dissertation titled &quot;You Must Defeat Sheng Long to Stand a Chance&quot; suggested Guile acted as a connection for the series to American blockbuster films, comparing him to characters such as Rambo or those played by Charles Bronson who were often involved in quests for vengeance. He further argued that Guile&#x27;s military background was not only intended to reflect the &quot;one man army&quot; hero archetype common in American films, but also reflect Japanese views of foreign military forces, establishing him to Japanese audiences as different from themselves compared to Ken for example, and thus not portrayed as crucial for inclusion in subsequent &quot;Street Fighter&quot; entries. Ware elaborated further to state he represents &quot;both a trust in and a fear of white Western power, particularly military/martial power.&quot; University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson also discussed the use of imagery and military aspects to illustrate Guile as &quot;not Japanese&quot;, stating that combat was &quot;militarized and sexualized&quot; through the presentation of his character and aesthetics in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. She also noted the increased use of American iconography in this regard, namely in comparison to the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, and how significant it was to Guile as a character through aspects such as his tattoos.

Guile has also appeared in the manga &quot;Hi Score Girl&quot; by Rensuke Oshikiri. The series&#x27; main character, Haruo Yaguchi, is a fan of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and always plays as Guile. This tends to be exaggerated to the point Haruo suffers from hallucinations where he talks to Guile while playing the game or interacting with other gamers. In Japan, the character has been used by cosmetic company Yanagiya as a real-world spokesman for their &quot;J-Gel&quot; hair products.

Guile artwork was featured on an officially licensed NubyTech/UDON joypad for the Xbox, announced on May 25, 2005.

<doc id="505178" wikidata="Q31306" url="?curid=505178" title="Sons of Liberty">
<text>The Sons of Liberty was a loosely organized, clandestine, sometimes violent, political organization active in the Thirteen American Colonies founded to advance the rights of the colonists and to fight taxation by the British government. It played a major role in most colonies in battling the Stamp Act in 1765 and throughout the entire period of the American Revolution. Historian David C. Rapoport called the activities of the Sons of Liberty &quot;mob terror.&quot;

In popular thought, the Sons of Liberty was a formal underground organization with recognized members and leaders. More likely, the name was an underground term for any men resisting new Crown taxes and laws. The well-known label allowed organizers to make or create anonymous summons to a Liberty Tree, &quot;Liberty Pole&quot;, or other public meeting-place. Furthermore, a unifying name helped to promote inter-colonial efforts against Parliament and the Crown&#x27;s actions. Their motto became &quot;No taxation without representation.&quot;

==History==
In 1765, the British government needed money to afford the 10,000 officers and soldiers living in the colonies, and intended that the colonists living there should contribute. The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative. This became commonly known as &quot;No Taxation without Representation.&quot; Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies despite the fact that the colonists had no representative in Parliament. The most incendiary tax was the Stamp Act of 1765, which caused a firestorm of opposition through legislative resolutions (starting in the colony of Virginia), public demonstrations, threats, and occasional hurtful losses.

The name is presumed to have been inspired by the phrase&#x27;s use in a pro-American, anti-taxation speech in the House of Commons on February 6, 1765, by Irish MP Isaac Barré. A precursor of the Sons of Liberty in Boston was the Loyal Nine, which burned effigies of Stamp Act commissioner Andrew Oliver in Boston on August 14, 1765. When he did not resign, the group escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.

The organization spread after independent starts in several different colonies under various names. The name Sons of Liberty was used beginning in November in New York and Connecticut. By November 6, a committee was set up in New York City to correspond with other colonies, and by November 11 a meeting in Windham, Connecticut laid out organizational plans. In December an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut, and the name of Sons of Liberty was first used in Boston. January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence, Rhode Island had initiated connections with New York, New Hampshire, and Newport, Rhode Island. March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.

To celebrate the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766, the Sons of Liberty in Dedham, Massachusetts, erected the Pillar of Liberty.

The Sons of Liberty popularized the use of tar and feathering to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.

On August 14, 1769, the Boston Sons of Liberty held a public rally in celebration of the 4th Anniversary of their founding. At 11 in the morning they gathered at the Liberty Tree in Boston where they gave speeches and made toasts; they then paraded to the Liberty Tree Tavern in nearby Dorchester, where they held a celebratory dinner of 300 members of the organization in a tent set up next to the tavern, where &quot;Music played, and at proper Intervals Cannon were fired. [...] About Five o&#x27;Clock the Company left [the tavern] in a Procession that extended near a Mile and a half, and before Dark entered the City, went round the State House and retired each to his own House.&quot; 

At this time in the history of their organization, they still considered themselves to be loyal subjects of the monarchy of Great Britain; when it came time at both events to give a round of toasts, the first toasts were to &quot;The King, the Queen and the Royal Family&quot;; only much later during the course of the Revolution did they begin to stridently oppose giving any support to the monarchy. 

The Bostonian branch of the Sons of Liberty were responsible for organizing and executing the famous Boston Tea Party of 1773 in response to the Tea Act.

Early in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the Committee of Safety.

===New York===
&quot;The association of the Sons of Liberty was organized in 1765, soon after the passage of the Stamp Act, and extended throughout the colonies, from Massachusetts to South Carolina. It appears that New York was the central post from which communications were dispatched, to and from the east and to the south as far as Maryland...&quot; 

While the exact name &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; may not have been taken up as their official moniker by the leaders of the New York opposition to the Stamp Act in 1765 - they were popularly known there around that time as &quot;The Liberty Boys&quot; - it appears that they were known to other &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; organizations in other states by that name not long after that time. There is a letter written by the &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; in Baltimore, Maryland, &quot;to the Sons of Liberty in New York&quot;, dated 6 March 1766 in which the Baltimore &quot;Sons&quot; thanked their New York brethren for having forced Zachariah Hood, who had been appointed stamp-master for Maryland, into resigning his commission. Hood had arrived in New York on a ship from London, and as soon as his mission became known to The Liberty Boys of New York, they arranged for a meeting with him at which they reasoned with him in their own inimitable way and thus secured his &quot;resignation.&quot; 

A list of New York members of the Sons of Liberty compiled by the Sons in Maryland, written on 1 March 1766, lists the following correspondents in the colony of New York: &quot;New York [city] — John Lamb, Isaac Sears, William Wiley, Edward Laight, Thomas Robinson, Flores Bancker, Charles Nicoll, Joseph Allicoke, and Gershom Mott. 
Jer. Van Rensselaer, Maynard Roseboom, Rob. Henry, and Thos. Young, Albany. 
John S. Hobart, Gilbert Potter, Thomas Brush, Cornelius Conklin, and Nathaniel Williams, Huntington, Long Island. 
George Townsend, Barack Sneething, Benjamin Townsend, George Weeks, Michael Weeks, and Rowland Chambers, Oyster Bay, Long Island.&quot;

In December 1773, a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the &quot;Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York&quot;, which formally stated that they were opposed to the Tea Act and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was &quot;an enemy to the liberties of America&quot; and that &quot;&quot;whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions, we will not deal with, or employ, or have any connection with him.&quot;&quot;

After the end of the American Revolutionary War, Isaac Sears, Marinus Willet, and John Lamb revived in New York City the Sons of Liberty. In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the Treaty of Paris (1783), they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists. Alexander Hamilton defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty.

==Flags==
An original flag flown from the Liberty Tree is in the collection of Revolutionary Spaces in Boston at the Old State House. The flag is wool with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. The owner of the flag post-Revolution, Samuel &quot;Rat-Trap&quot; Adams, claimed that the flag was used by the Sons of Liberty, although there is no contemporary documentation of a non-British striped flag used by the Sons of Liberty. A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes was used by the Continental Navy and by American merchant ships during the war, although the two styles of flag do not appear to be related.

==Later societies==
At various times, small secret organizations took the name &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;. They generally left very few records. In the early 19th century, there was an organization in Bennington, Vermont named the Sons of Liberty; this organisation included local notables such as military officer Martin Scott and Hiram Harwood.

The Improved Order of Red Men, established in 1834, claimed to be descended from the original Sons of Liberty, noting that the Sons participated in the Boston Tea Party dressed as their idea of &quot;Indians&quot;.
The name was also used during the American Civil War. The Copperhead group, the Knights of the Golden Circle, reorganized in 1863 as the &quot;Order of American Knights&quot;. In 1864, it became the Order of the Sons of Liberty, with the Ohio politician Clement L. Vallandigham, most prominent of the Copperheads, as its supreme commander. In most areas, only a minority of its membership was radical enough to discourage enlistments, resist the draft, and shield deserters. The group held numerous peace meetings. A few agitators, some of them encouraged by Southern money, talked of a revolt in the Old Northwest, with the goal of ending the war. In 1864, both the KGC and the Order of the Sons of Liberty were prosecuted for treason by federal authorities, especially in Indiana.

In 1948, a radical wing of the Zionist movement, calling itself the &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, launched a boycott of British films in the U.S.; this was in response to British policies in Palestine.

<text>The Royal Victoria Dock is the largest of three docks in the Royal Docks of east London, now part of the redeveloped Docklands.

== History ==
Although, the structure was in place in the year 1850, it was opened in 1855, on a previously uninhabited area of the Plaistow Marshes. It was the first of the Royal Docks and the first London dock to be designed specifically to accommodate large steam ships. It was also the first to use hydraulic power to operate its machinery and the first to be connected to the national railway network, via the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway section of what is now the North London line. It was initially known as &quot;Victoria Dock&quot;; the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; was granted in 1880.

The dock was connected to the national rail network via a line which ran between Canning Town and North Woolwich. When the Royal Dock was first built, the railway cut along the docks; to correct this, a swing bridge over the entrance to the dock was built. This however, slowed journey time, and so a new line was built in 1855, to take the route around the north side of the dock to Silvertown, and a station at Custom House opened where it re-connected with the original line. The older southern line was kept to serve local factories, where it was known as the Silvertown Tramway.

The Royal Victoria Dock consisted of a main dock and a basin to the west, providing an entrance to the Thames on the western side of the complex. The dock was deeply indented with four solid piers, each 152 m long by 43 m wide, on which were constructed two-storey warehouses. Other warehouses, granaries, shed and storage buildings surrounded the dock, which had a total of 3.6 km of quays.

The dock was an immediate commercial success, as it could easily accommodate all but the very largest steamships. By 1860, it was already taking over 850,000 tons of shipping a year – double that of the London Docks, four times that of St Katharine Docks and 70% more than the West India Docks and East India Docks combined. It was badly damaged by German bombing in the Second World War, but experienced a resurgence in trade following the war. From the 1960s onwards, the Royal Victoria experienced a steady decline – as did all of London&#x27;s other docks – as the shipping industry adopted containerisation, which effectively moved traffic downstream to Tilbury. It finally closed to commercial traffic along with the other Royal Docks in 1981.

In 1988, the then-dilapidated site was chosen by French electronic musician Jean-Michel Jarre as the site for one of his signature large-scale concerts, eventually titled Destination Docklands. The area also inspired him to write the album &quot;Revolutions&quot; specifically for the event.

The Royal Victoria Dock experienced major redevelopment initiated by the London Docklands Development Corporation in the 1990s. Developments included Britannia Village, which was carried out by Wimpey Homes, the Peabody Trust and the East Thames Housing Group in the mid-1990s.

Most of the original buildings were demolished but a few historic warehouses survived. More recent development has included the Royal Victoria Dock Bridge completed in 1998, and the ExCeL Exhibition Centre, constructed on the north quayside, which opened in November 2000.

== Events ==
On 15 August 2009, the dock hosted the inaugural Great London Swim, a mass participation open water swim over a one-mile distance. The event has been held annually since then but on the first weekend in July. On 16 to 17 June 2018, the dock hosted the F1H2O Grand Prix of London won by Erik Stark. Britannia Village has its own Community Foundation.

Royal Victoria Dock is the starting location for the annual Docklands Head, a rowing head race hosted by Poplar Blackwall and District Rowing Club. The race starts under the Royal Victoria Dock Bridge and proceeds eastwards underneath Connaught Footbridge and Connaught Road Bridge, finishing at the eastern end of the Royal Albert Dock.

<text>The Ministry of Culture () is the government department of Greece entrusted with preserving the country&#x27;s cultural heritage and promoting the arts. The incumbent minister is Lina Mendoni, and the deputy minister is .

== History ==
This ministry was established on 26 August 1971 as the Ministry of Culture and Sciences (), and was renamed the Ministry of Culture () on 26 July 1985. On 7 October 2009, it was merged with the Ministry of Touristic Development to form the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. It ceased to exist on 21 June 2012, when the Ministry of Tourism was re-established and the culture portfolio was absorbed by the Ministry of Education, Lifelong Learning and Religious Affairs to form the Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports. A separate Ministry of Culture and Sports was re-established on 25 June 2013, but on 27 January 2015 it was again merged with the education ministry to form the Ministry of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs. On 23 September 2015, the merger was reversed and the culture and education portfolios were restored as separate ministries. On 27 June 2023, the sports portfolio was absorbed by the education ministry and the Ministry of Culture reverted to its 1985–2009 name.

<doc id="505187" wikidata="Q412281" url="?curid=505187" title="Skatole">
<text>Skatole or 3-methylindole is an organic compound belonging to the indole family. It occurs naturally in the feces of mammals and birds and is the primary contributor to fecal odor. In low concentrations, it has a flowery smell and is found in several flowers and essential oils, including those of orange blossoms, jasmine, and &quot;Ziziphus mauritiana&quot;. It has also been identified in certain cannabis varieties.

It is used as a fragrance and fixative in many perfumes and as an aroma compound. It is also used in low concentrations in some ice cream as a flavor enhancer. Its name derives from the Greek root &quot;skato-&quot;, meaning feces. Skatole was discovered in 1877 by the German physician Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919).

==Biosynthesis, chemical synthesis, and reactions==
Skatole is derived from the amino acid tryptophan in the digestive tract of mammals. Tryptophan is converted to indoleacetic acid, which decarboxylates to give the methylindole. Once it is created in the digestive tract of mammals, it is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver.

Skatole can be synthesized via the Fischer indole synthesis.

It gives a violet color upon treatment with potassium ferrocyanide.

Skatole, along with the fecal odorant indole, can be neutralized by combining it with other scents, by producing perfumes or air fresheners that lack skatole and indole. In a manner similar to noise-cancelling headphones, the scent produced by the resultant concentrations of skatole and indole relative to other substances in the freshener is thus &quot;in-phase&quot; and perceived as pleasant.

==Insect studies==

Skatole is one of many compounds that are attractive to males of various species of orchid bees, which apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones; it is commonly used as bait for these bees for study. It is also known for being an attractant for the Tasmanian grass grub beetle (&quot;Aphodius tasmaniae&quot;).

Skatole has been shown to be an attractant to mosquitoes in both field and laboratory conditions. Because this compound is present in feces, it is found in combined sewage overflows (CSO), as streams and lakes containing CSO water have untreated human and industrial waste. CSO sites are thus of particular interest when studying mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus.

The release of skatole by certain parasitic wasps in the family Bethylidae is used to determine which subfamily the species belongs to. Species of the Epyrinae subfamily release skatole, while those in the Bethylinae subfamily release a different chemical, spiroacetal.

==Animal studies==
Skatole occurs naturally in the feces of all species of mammals and birds, and in the bovine rumen.

Skatole has been shown to cause pulmonary edema in goats, sheep, rats, and some strains of mice. It appears to selectively target club cells, which are the major site of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the lungs. These enzymes convert skatole to a reactive intermediate, 3-methyleneindolenine, which damages cells by forming protein adducts (see fog fever).

With the testicular steroid androstenone, skatole is regarded as a principal determinant of boar taint. High amounts of skatole stored in the fat tissue of pigs corresponds with boar taint. To address this, vaccinations with an immunogenic amount of Lawsonia intracellularis antigen are being studied. This antigen reduces the uptake of skatole into the fat of pigs, thus reducing the effect of boar taint. Another method used to address skatole concentration in fat tissue is supplementing the pig&#x27;s diet with 3% chestnut wood extract. This method showed that intestinal skatole concentration decreased by more than 50%.

Skatole contributes to bad breath.

==Application==
Skatole is the starting material in the synthesis of atiprosin.

<doc id="505189" wikidata="Q1128903" url="?curid=505189" title="Continuation">
<text>In computer science, a continuation is an abstract representation of the control state of a computer program. A continuation implements (reifies) the program control state, i.e. the continuation is a data structure that represents the computational process at a given point in the process&#x27;s execution; the created data structure can be accessed by the programming language, instead of being hidden in the runtime environment. Continuations are useful for encoding other control mechanisms in programming languages such as exceptions, generators, coroutines, and so on.

The &quot;current continuation&quot; or &quot;continuation of the computation step&quot; is the continuation that, from the perspective of running code, would be derived from the current point in a program&#x27;s execution. The term &quot;continuations&quot; can also be used to refer to first-class continuations, which are constructs that give a programming language the ability to save the execution state at any point and return to that point at a later point in the program, possibly multiple times.

==History==
The earliest description of continuations was made by Adriaan van Wijngaarden in September 1964. Wijngaarden spoke at the IFIP Working Conference on Formal Language Description Languages held in Baden bei Wien, Austria. As part of a formulation for an Algol 60 preprocessor, he called for a transformation of proper procedures into continuation-passing style, though he did not use this name, and his intention was to simplify a program and thus make its result more clear.

Christopher Strachey, Christopher P. Wadsworth and John C. Reynolds brought the term &quot;continuation&quot; into prominence in their work in the field of denotational semantics that makes extensive use of continuations to allow sequential programs to be analysed in terms of functional programming semantics.

Steve Russell invented the continuation in his second Lisp implementation for the IBM 704, though he did not name it.

 gives a complete history of the discovery of continuations.

==First-class continuations==
First-class continuations are a language&#x27;s ability to completely control the execution order of instructions. They can be used to jump to a function that produced the call to the current function, or to a function that has previously exited. One can think of a first-class continuation as saving the &quot;execution&quot; state of the program. True first-class continuations do not save program data – unlike a process image – only the execution context. This is illustrated by the &quot;continuation sandwich&quot; description:
&quot;Say you&#x27;re in the kitchen in front of the refrigerator, thinking about a sandwich. You take a continuation right there and stick it in your pocket. Then you get some turkey and bread out of the refrigerator and make yourself a sandwich, which is now sitting on the counter. You invoke the continuation in your pocket, and you find yourself standing in front of the refrigerator again, thinking about a sandwich. But fortunately, there&#x27;s a sandwich on the counter, and all the materials used to make it are gone. So you eat it. :-)&quot;
In this description, the sandwich is part of the program &quot;data&quot; (e.g., an object on the heap), and rather than calling a &quot;make sandwich&quot; routine and then returning, the person called a &quot;make sandwich with current continuation&quot; routine, which creates the sandwich and then continues where execution left off.

Scheme was the first full production system providing first &quot;catch&quot; and then call/cc. Bruce Duba introduced call/cc into SML.

Continuations are also used in models of computation including denotational semantics, the actor model, process calculi, and lambda calculus. These models rely on programmers or semantics engineers to write mathematical functions in the so-called continuation-passing style. This means that each function consumes a function that represents the rest of the computation relative to this function call. To return a value, the function calls this &quot;continuation function&quot; with a return value; to abort the computation it returns a value.

Functional programmers who write their programs in continuation-passing style gain the expressive power to manipulate the flow of control in arbitrary ways. The cost is that they must maintain the invariants of control and continuations by hand, which can be a highly complex undertaking (but see &#x27;continuation-passing style&#x27; below).

===Uses===
Continuations simplify and clarify the implementation of several common design patterns, including coroutines/green threads and exception handling, by providing the basic, low-level primitive which unifies these seemingly unconnected patterns. Continuations can provide elegant solutions to some difficult high-level problems, like programming a web server that supports multiple pages, accessed by the use of the forward and back buttons and by following links. The Smalltalk Seaside web framework uses continuations to great effect, allowing one to program the web server in procedural style, by switching continuations when switching pages.

More complex constructs for which &quot;continuations provide an elegant description&quot; also exist. For example, in C, longjmp can be used to jump from the middle of one function to another, provided the second function lies deeper in the stack (if it is waiting for the first function to return, possibly among others). Other more complex examples include coroutines in Simula 67, Lua, and Perl; tasklets in Stackless Python; generators in Icon and Python; continuations in Scala (starting in 2.8); fibers in Ruby (starting in 1.9.1); the backtracking mechanism in Prolog; monads in functional programming; and threads.

===Examples===

The Scheme programming language includes the control operator call-with-current-continuation (abbreviated as: call/cc) with which a Scheme program can manipulate the flow of control:
 (define the-continuation #f)

 (define (test)
 (let ((i 0))
 ; call/cc calls its first function argument, passing
 ; a continuation variable representing this point in
 ; the program as the argument to that function.
 ; In this case, the function argument assigns that
 ; continuation to the variable the-continuation.
 (call/cc (lambda (k) (set! the-continuation k)))
 ; The next time the-continuation is called, we start here.
 (set! i (+ i 1))
 i))
Using the above, the following code block defines a function codice_1 that sets codice_2 to the future execution state of itself:
 &gt; (test)
 1
 &gt; (the-continuation)
 2
 &gt; (the-continuation)
 3
 &gt; ; stores the current continuation (which will print 4 next) away
 &gt; (define another-continuation the-continuation)
 &gt; (test) ; resets the-continuation
 1
 &gt; (the-continuation)
 2
 &gt; (another-continuation) ; uses the previously stored continuation
 4
For a gentler introduction to this mechanism, see call-with-current-continuation.

====Coroutines====

This example shows a possible usage of continuations to implement coroutines as separate threads.
 ;;; A naive queue for thread scheduling.
 ;;; It holds a list of continuations &quot;waiting to run&quot;.

 (define *queue* &#x27;())

 (define (empty-queue?)
 (null? *queue*))

 (define (enqueue x)
 (set! *queue* (append *queue* (list x))))

 (define (dequeue)
 (let ((x (car *queue*)))
 (set! *queue* (cdr *queue*))
 x))

 ;;; This starts a new thread running (proc).

 (define (fork proc)
 (call/cc
 (lambda (k)
 (enqueue k)
 (proc))))

 ;;; This yields the processor to another thread, if there is one.

 (define (yield)
 (call/cc
 (lambda (k)
 (enqueue k)
 ((dequeue)))))

 ;;; This terminates the current thread, or the entire program
 ;;; if there are no other threads left.

 (define (thread-exit)
 (if (empty-queue?)
 (exit)
 ((dequeue))))
The functions defined above allow for defining and executing threads through cooperative multitasking, i.e. threads that yield control to the next one in a queue:
 ;;; The body of some typical Scheme thread that does stuff:

 (define (do-stuff-n-print str)
 (lambda ()
 (let loop ((n 0))
 (format #t &quot;~A ~A\n&quot; str n)
 (yield)
 (loop (+ n 1)))))

 ;;; Create two threads, and start them running.
 (fork (do-stuff-n-print &quot;This is AAA&quot;))
 (fork (do-stuff-n-print &quot;Hello from BBB&quot;))
 (thread-exit)
The previous code will produce this output:
 This is AAA 0
 Hello from BBB 0
 This is AAA 1
 Hello from BBB 1
 This is AAA 2
 Hello from BBB 2

===Implementation===

A program must allocate space in memory for the variables its functions use. Most programming languages use a call stack for storing the variables needed because it allows for fast and simple allocating and automatic deallocation of memory. Other programming languages use a heap for this, which allows for flexibility at a higher cost for allocating and deallocating memory. Both of these implementations have benefits and drawbacks in the context of continuations.

===Programming language support===
Many programming languages exhibit first-class continuations under various names; specifically:
*Common Lisp: cl-cont. One can also use custom macros
*C# / VB.NET: codice_3 and codice_4: &quot;sign up the rest of method as the continuation, and then return to your caller immediately; the task will invoke the continuation when it completes&quot;. Asynchronous Programming for C#
*Factor: codice_5 and codice_6
*Haskell: The Continuation monad in codice_7
*Haxe: haxe-continuation
*Icon, Unicon : codice_8 operator: coexpressions
*Java: Lightwolf javaflow (requires bytecode manipulation at runtime or compile time)
*Kotlin : codice_9
*JavaScript Rhino : codice_9
*Parrot: codice_9 PMC; uses continuation-passing style for all control flow
*Perl: Coro and Continuity
*Pico: codice_12 and codice_13
*Python: PyPy&#x27;s codice_14
*Racket: codice_15 (commonly shortened to codice_16)
*Ruby: codice_17
*Scala: codice_18 provides codice_19/codice_20
*Scheme: codice_15 (commonly shortened to codice_16)
*Smalltalk: codice_23; in most modern Smalltalk environments continuations can be implemented without additional VM support.
*Standard ML of New Jersey: codice_24
*Unlambda: codice_25, the flow control operation for call with current continuation
In any language which supports closures and proper tail calls, it is possible to write programs in continuation-passing style and manually implement call/cc. (In continuation-passing style, call/cc becomes a simple function that can be written with lambda.) This is a particularly common strategy in Haskell, where it is easy to construct a &quot;continuation-passing monad&quot; (for example, the codice_26 monad and codice_27 monad transformer in the codice_28 library). The support for proper tail calls is needed because in continuation-passing style no function ever returns; &quot;all&quot; calls are tail calls.

==In Web development==
One area that has seen practical use of continuations is in Web programming. The use of continuations shields the programmer from the stateless nature of the HTTP protocol. In the traditional model of web programming, the lack of state is reflected in the program&#x27;s structure, leading to code constructed around a model that lends itself very poorly to expressing computational problems. Thus continuations enable code that has the useful properties associated with inversion of control, while avoiding its problems. &quot;Inverting back the inversion of control or, Continuations versus page-centric programming&quot; is a paper that provides a good introduction to continuations applied to web programming.

==Kinds==
Support for continuations varies widely. A programming language supports &quot;re-invocable&quot; continuations if a continuation may be invoked repeatedly (even after it has already returned). Re-invocable continuations were introduced by Peter J. Landin using his J (for Jump) operator that could transfer the flow of control back into the middle of a procedure invocation. Re-invocable continuations have also been called &quot;re-entrant&quot; in the Racket language. However this use of the term &quot;re-entrant&quot; can be easily confused with its use in discussions of multithreading.

A more limited kind is the &quot;escape continuation&quot; that may be used to escape the current context to a surrounding one. Many languages which do not explicitly support continuations support exception handling, which is equivalent to escape continuations and can be used for the same purposes. C&#x27;s codice_29 are also equivalent: they can only be used to unwind the stack. Escape continuations can also be used to implement tail call elimination.

One generalization of continuations are delimited continuations. Continuation operators like codice_16 capture the &quot;entire&quot; remaining computation at a given point in the program and provide no way of delimiting this capture. Delimited continuation operators address this by providing two separate control mechanisms: a &quot;prompt&quot; that delimits a continuation operation and a &quot;reification&quot; operator such as codice_19 or codice_32. Continuations captured using delimited operators thus only represent a slice of the program context.

==Disadvantages==
Continuations are the functional expression of the GOTO statement, and the same caveats apply. While they are a sensible option in some special cases such as web programming, use of continuations can result in code that is difficult to follow. In fact, the esoteric programming language Unlambda includes call-with-current-continuation as one of its features solely because expressions involving it &quot;tend to be hopelessly difficult to track down&quot;. The external links below illustrate the concept in more detail.

==Linguistics==

In &quot;Continuations and the nature of quantification&quot;, Chris Barker introduced the &quot;continuation hypothesis&quot;, that

some linguistic expressions (in particular, QNPs [quantificational noun phrases]) have denotations that manipulate their own continuations.

Barker argued that this hypothesis could be used to explain phenomena such as &quot;duality of NP meaning&quot; (e.g., the fact that the QNP &quot;everyone&quot; behaves very differently from the non-quantificational noun phrase &quot;Bob&quot; in contributing towards the meaning of a sentence like &quot;Alice sees [Bob/everyone]&quot;), &quot;scope displacement&quot; (e.g., that &quot;a raindrop fell on every car&quot; is interpreted typically as formula_1 rather than as formula_2), and &quot;scope ambiguity&quot; (that a sentence like &quot;someone saw everyone&quot; may be ambiguous between formula_3 and formula_4). He also observed that this idea is in a way just a natural extension of Richard Montague&#x27;s approach in &quot;The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English&quot; (PTQ), writing that &quot;with the benefit of hindsight, a limited form of continuation-passing is clearly discernible at the core of Montague’s (1973) PTQ treatment of NPs as generalized quantifiers&quot;.

The extent to which continuations can be used to explain other general phenomena in natural language is a topic of current research.

<doc id="505199" wikidata="Q3174319" url="?curid=505199" title="Green Bullfrog">
<text>Green Bullfrog is a blues album recorded by an ad hoc band and produced by Derek Lawrence. The bulk of the album was recorded over two sessions at De Lane Lea Studios, London in 1970, with later string and brass overdubs. It was originally released in 1971, with reissues in 1980 and 1991.

The album listed pseudonyms in the credits for contractual reasons and was commercially unsuccessful. The musicians were eventually confirmed as including Deep Purple&#x27;s Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Paice, Procol Harum&#x27;s Matthew Fisher, Chas &amp; Dave&#x27;s Chas Hodges and session guitarists Albert Lee and Big Jim Sullivan.

==Background==

&quot;Green Bullfrog&quot; was the idea of producer Derek Lawrence, who assembled a group of musicians with whom he had worked in the 1960s. Guitarist Albert Lee had been working with Lawrence as a session player, and the original idea had been to record with former Screaming Lord Sutch bassist Tony Dangerfield. However, the sessions did not work out, so the pair decided to invite other session musicians and Sutch alumni and record a studio jam.

The backing tracks were recorded in two overnight sessions on 20 April and 23 May 1970 at De Lane Lea Studios, London, starting at 11pm. It was recorded live into four track tape. Deep Purple and former Sutch guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had previously worked with Lawrence and brought along their drummer Ian Paice. According to Lee, Blackmore and Paice arrived at the studio directly from Deep Purple gigs on both occasions. Session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan was invited as he had originally taught Blackmore how to play guitar and was greatly admired by him. Guitarist Rod Alexander was friends with Blackmore and worked in a music shop on Charing Cross Road. He arrived at the session to deliver some guitar strings and was persuaded to stay. All the musicians had wanted to play together for some time, but were too busy with touring or session work to do so. Singer Earl Jordan had been recording with the Les Humphries Singers. He put down guide vocals during the main session, then re-recorded all his parts after everyone else had left. Strings and brass overdubs were added on 4 January 1971.

A few originals (penned by Lawrence) were played, as well as many blues-inflected cover versions. Sullivan rearranged Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lovin&#x27; You (Is Good for Me Baby)&quot; in compound time to make it more interesting to play. The guitar workout instrumental &quot;Bullfrog&quot; is a Deep Purple song &quot;Jam Stew&quot;, which had been previously recorded at a BBC Radio 1 session. Blackmore played the main riff once to Sullivan and Lee, who both immediately created guitar harmonies around it. The track also features Tony Ashton on Hammond organ. The sessions also included a cover of the Creation&#x27;s &quot;Makin&#x27; Time&quot;, which Blackmore and Lawrence had both wanted to record. Lawrence selected all the other songs for everyone to record.

For contractual reasons, the musicians were billed under pseudonyms. Lee was called &quot;Pinta&quot; after an in-joke where he would say &quot;I&#x27;m only delivering the milk!&quot; when a second take of a song was requested. Ashton was called &quot;Bevy&quot; because he liked to keep bottles of light ale under his organ. Bassist Chas Hodges (who previously played with Blackmore in the Outlaws and would later be one half of Chas &amp; Dave) took the name &quot;Sleepy&quot; due to his habit of falling asleep at sessions. Blackmore was called &quot;Boots&quot; because he frequently wore suede cowboy boots, while Sullivan was nicknamed &quot;The Boss&quot; due to his respect from the others as one of the best session players. Procol Harum&#x27;s Matthew Fisher, who played piano on the album, was named &quot;Sorry&quot; after his reputation of apologising if another take was required. Alexander was called &quot;The Vicar&quot; after Lawrence&#x27;s habit of saying &quot;hello, vicar&quot; to him, while Paice was nicknamed &quot;Speedy&quot; owing to his fast playing style. Despite rumours at the time, Roger Glover and Jon Lord did not attend any of the sessions.

==Release==
The title &quot;Green Bullfrog&quot; was chosen by Lawrence. Hodges later said it was because Lawrence wanted to name every project after a colour. The first release of the session was on 19 March 1971 in the US by Decca Records, as well as a single coupling the tracks &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot; and &quot;Lovin&#x27; You Is Good for Me, Baby&quot;. It was issued in the UK by MCA Records in March 1972 after Lawrence played some tracks to company president Mike Maitland. However, Maitland had left the company by the time the album was released, so it had little promotion and was commercially unsuccessful.

The album was re-released in 1980 under ECY Street Records in the US. The reissue had additional sleeve notes written by Ed Chapero. The front cover had a quote from Blackmore taken from an interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine in September 1978, which correctly identified himself, Paice, Lee and Sullivan on the album but mistakenly credited Glover. Both Blackmore and Glover were unimpressed with the front cover quotation. It was remixed at Abbey Road Studios, London in 1991 by Lawrence and engineer Peter Vince and reissued on LP and CD. The re-release contained extra tracks not on the original release, and additional information and sleeve notes including an interview with Lawrence. It was the first release that properly credited all the musicians. Four tracks recorded by Green Bullfrog have been published on the 2005 Blackmore compilation &quot;Get Away – Groups and Sessions&quot;.

Dave Thompson gave a retrospective review on AllMusic which was mixed, praising the quality of musicians, but felt there was &quot;little [...] to truly engage the attention&quot;.

<text>Portaria (Greek: Πορταριά) is a village and a former municipality in Magnesia, Thessaly, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Volos, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 22.754 km2. It is located on Mt. Pelion, facing the Pagasetic Gulf, north of Volos and its suburbs. The majority of the buildings are typical examples of Pelion architecture with their windows and doors decorated with a variety of colors. The mountaintop of Pelion is to the north. Portaria every year holds a traditional wedding in the main square of the village and many people from Volos and the surrounding villages drop by to learn how weddings were traditionally done in these villages.

<doc id="505204" wikidata="Q4870010" url="?curid=505204" title="Battle Creek (Milk River tributary)">
<text>Battle Creek is a river that begins in the south-eastern region of the Canadian province of Alberta, near the border with Saskatchewan, in the Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park. From Alberta, Battle Creek flows east and across the border into Saskatchewan. It flows south out of Saskatchewan across the Canada–United States border into Montana, where it joins the Milk River in Blaine County, Montana.

== Description ==
Battle Creek begins in the Cypress Hills and Palliser&#x27;s Triangle region of Alberta, is long, has a drainage area of , and flows through Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Montana en route to its mouth at the Milk River. The landscape it runs though is semi-arid with rolling hills, deep-cut valleys, coulees, badlands, and grasslands. Due to the semi-arid climate, the area is prone to drought so several dams and irrigation projects have been built in its watershed. In the 1930s, two notable dam projects were built to help regulate the river&#x27;s water levels. Near the headwaters of Battle Creek, a dam was built along Adams Creek – a tributary of Battle Creek – that created Adams Lake (). During the dry months, water can be released from Adams Lake to help prevent Battle Creek from dying up, which allows for irrigation throughout the growing season. Another project involved the building of two dams that created Cypress Lake. Cypress Lake, while not along the course of Battle Creek, is supplied by Battle Creek plus other nearby creeks. Cypress Lake is an interbasin transfer reservoir as it is the source of the Frenchman River and can re-supply Battle Creek during dry years.

Battle Creek and the other tributaries of the Milk River watershed in Alberta and Saskatchewan, is one of only three watersheds in Canada where the water ultimately flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The other two watersheds are Poplar River and Big Muddy Creek.

Near the community of Nashlyn in Saskatchewan, Battle Creek flows through a portion of the Govenlock-Nashlyn-Battle Creek Grasslands Important Bird Area (IBA) of Canada.

Fort Walsh was established on the river on the Saskatchewan side of Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park.

== Fish species ==
Fish species commonly found in the river include northern pike, rainbow trout, brook trout, brown trout, burbot, common carp, white sucker, and shorthead redhorse. The Battle Creek, along with Lake Diefenbaker, are the only two bodies of water in Saskatchewan that support a reproducing population of rainbow trout. There is concern that Asian carp, particularly silver carp, may spread up the river and to the other south flowing rivers that drain into the Milk River, such as the Frenchman River.

<text>Max Klinger (18 February 1857 – 5 July 1920) was a German artist who produced significant work in painting, sculpture, prints and graphics, as well as writing a treatise articulating his ideas on art and the role of graphic arts and printmaking in relation to painting. He is associated with symbolism, the Vienna Secession, and Jugendstil (Youth Style) the German manifestation of Art Nouveau. He is best known today for his many prints, particularly a series entitled &quot;Paraphrase on the Finding of a Glove&quot; and his monumental sculptural installation in homage to Beethoven at the Vienna Secession in 1902.

== Life ==
Klinger was born in Leipzig, Kingdom of Saxony to a wealthy and prominent family. He enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe in 1874 where he was a pupil of Karl (or Carl) Gussow. When Gussow left Karlsruhe to become the Director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin, Klinger moved to Berlin as well to complete his studies there. Klinger shared a studio with Christian Krohg and the two had a mutual admiration for French naturalist authors like Émile Zola and Gustave Flaubert, who explored the shadowy aspects of urban life and the hypocrisy of society and the bourgeoisie in their novels. At that time realism was the prevailing style in Germany and Arnold Böcklin was one of the few artist active there that Klinger felt a close affinity to. Klinger graduated from the Academy in 1877. He was drawn to and studied the etchings and prints of many masters that were more aligned with his sensibilities including Dürer, Rembrandt, Goya, Runge, Menzel, and Rops. He began an apprenticeship studying engraving under Hermann Sagert and soon became a skilled and imaginative engraver in his own right. Klinger visited Brussels for a time in 1879, and the following year he spent time in Munich. He was achieving some notoriety with his pen and ink drawings and prints when in 1881 he published two sets of etchings, including &quot;Paraphrase on the Finding of a Glove&quot;, which was an immediate success and established his reputation.

With a receptive audience developing in Paris, where the Franco-Uruguayan poet and art critic Jules Laforgue had been celebrating and advocating his prints, Klinger moved to Paris in 1883 where he lived until 1886 or 1887. Klinger first began sculpting about 1883, and sculpture slowly came to dominate his output in his later years. He conceived and started work on his &quot;Beethoven&quot; sculpture while in Paris but, it was not completed and fully realized until 1902. In 1889 Les XX (The Twenty) invited Klinger to exhibit his work in their annual winter exhibition that year in Brussels. He moved to Rome in 1889, staying until 1893, studying the Italian masters, where the 15th century artists and works from antiquity are said to have been something of a revelation to him. He also intensified his studies of anatomy, the nude, and the representation of mass and volume during this period of his life. It was a productive time in his career. In the 1890s, Klinger continued his gradual shift away from printmaking in favor of sculpting.

Klinger was an accomplished pianist and counted the composer Max Reger among his friends. A friendship with the composer Johannes Brahms developed over a period of 20 years, culminating with Klinger&#x27;s publication of his print series &quot;Brahms Fantasies&quot; (1894) and Brahms&#x27;s dedication of &quot;Vier ernste Gesänge&quot; (&quot;Four Serious Songs&quot;), Opus 121, to Klinger in 1896, a year before the composer&#x27;s death.

In 1906 he founded the Villa Romana Prize. After buying a villa in Florence, complete with 15,000 square meter park, recipients of the prize were given the opportunity to stay for a few months and adsorbed the culture of the city. The first beneficiary of the prize was Gustav Klimt, however Klimt waived his honor and passed it on to Maximilian Kurzweil. Later recipients included Käthe Kollwitz, Max Beckmann, Ernst Barlach and Georg Kolbe.

Elsa Asenijeff (1867-1941) was a writer and poet, as well as a model, muse, and girlfriend of Klinger for about 15 years. They had a daughter Desirée Klinger (1900–1973) but were never married. In 1903 he moved away from Leipzig and bought a vineyard in Großjena [Gross Jena,], near Naumburg, Germany, where he settled in his later years. In 1911 Klinger left Asenijeff, when her mental health begin to show signs of deteriorating, for an 18-year-old model, Gertrud Bock (1893–1932), who he ultimately married a few months before his death in 1920. Klinger left his estate to Gertrud. The sculptor Johannes Hartmann, a friend of Klinger&#x27;s, served as caretaker of the Klinger estate and designed Klinger&#x27;s tomb with portraits of Klinger and Gertrud. Johannes Hartmann married Gertrud Klinger in 1922, however, much of the remainder of their lives was spent in litigation with Klinger&#x27;s daughter, Desirée Klinger over the estate.

==Art==
A significant portion of Klinger’s reputation is associated with his many cycles and series of intaglio prints, which influenced numerous printmakers and artist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Klinger would adeptly integrate several intaglio media like aquatint, drypoint, and etching in a single plate, producing remarkable formal and tonal qualities. The subjects range from esoteric symbolism to darker aspects of realism. In the cycle &quot;A Life&quot; (1884), Klinger is often regarded as the first German artist to deal with prostitution as a social problem and the hypocrisy and injustices regarding societies attitude to the subject. The series follow a middle-class woman&#x27;s descent into prostitution: impregnated, deserted, then rejected by society, she descends into the depths of urban life, and ridiculed by an apathetic and indifferent genteel society. The series &quot;A Love&quot; (1887) was dedicated to Arnold Böcklin another symbolist artist Klinger greatly admired.

In the series, &quot;Paraphrase on the Finding of a Glove&quot; (printed 1881), the pictures were based on images which came to Klinger in dreams after finding a glove at an ice-skating rink. In the leitmotivic device of a glove—belonging to a woman whose face we never see—Klinger anticipated the research of Freud and Krafft-Ebing on fetish objects. In this case, the glove becomes a symbol for the artist&#x27;s romantic yearnings, finding itself, in each plate, in different dramatic situations, and performing the role that we might expect the figure of the beloved herself to fulfill. Semioticians have also seen in the symbol of the glove an example of a sliding signifier, or signifier without signified—in this case, the identity of the woman which Klinger is careful to conceal. The plates suggest various psychological states or existential crises faced by the artist protagonist (who bears a striking resemblance to the young Klinger).

In Paris he started to draft his polemical text for &quot;Painting and Drawing&quot;, which was eventually published in 1891, and subsequently reissued a number of times. The manuscript was well circulated and well read, with a number of later artist and historians referencing it, including Giorgio de Chirico who called Klinger the &quot;modern artist par excellence&quot;. In it Klinger asserted the idea that prints and the graphic arts should have a new and significant role in the arts, distinct from painting, and were best suited for stylistic and conceptual experimentation. Also that the differences between naturalism (realism) and neo-idealism, as well as form and content, were reconcilable, and both were possible. Concepts of the Gesamtkunstwerk, an all-embracing art form, with unity among the arts (e.g. painting, sculpture, literature, poetry, music, etc.), were also discussed.

Klinger had a lifelong passion for music and musical elements are often reflected and expressed in his art. His print cycles were given opus numbers, typically associated with musical publications. His series &quot;Brahms Fantasies&quot; (1894) was intended to be an amalgamation of music, poetry, and the visual arts: to be viewed with a performance of the composer’s music, creating Gesamtkunstwerk or &quot;all-embracing art form&quot;. Klinger produced sculptures of Beethoven, Brahms, and Liszt as well as a bust of Richard Wagner and the plinth of the Richard Wagner Memorial (1911).

Inspired by recent accounts of archaeological discoveries of antique sculptural remains made from various colored stones, Klinger utilized a variety of materials in many of his sculptures. A mixture of bronze, ivory, alabaster, and several different marbles were used in &quot;Beethoven&quot;. He studied and took measurements of Beethoven&#x27;s death mask in Vienna and traveled to Laas in southwestern France to personally select the alabaster, and the Pyrenees and Syra (or Syros), Greece to select marbles. Elsa Asenijeff wrote of the unusually complex and difficult process involved with casting the large bronze throne from wax in her book &quot;Max Klinges Beethoven: Eine kunst-technische Studie&quot; (&quot;Max Klinge&#x27;s Beethoven: A Practical Artistic Study&quot;) published in 1902. The sculpture was exhibited in an earlier stage of development in Paris in 1885 and later rejected from major exhibitions in Berlin 1887 and 1888. It developed something of a cult-like reputation over the years.

Beethoven was the theme of the 14th exhibition of the Vienna Secession in 1902, and Max Klinger&#x27;s sculpture was brought to Vienna as the centerpiece. The Vienna Secession had hoped to purchase the sculpture but this was not to come to fruition. Headed by Alfred Roller, the artist of the Secession created works on the theme for the galleries and Roller and the architect Josef Hoffmann oversaw the overall installation. Klinger&#x27;s &quot;Beethoven&quot; was installed in the central hall with Alfred Roller&#x27;s mural &quot;Night Descending&quot; on the wall behind it. Gustav Klimt&#x27;s seminal &quot;Beethoven Frieze&quot; was visible in an adjoining room. Even the normally shy and retiring Gustav Mahler was persuaded to transcribe music from Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony for trumpets and rehearse the musicians for the opening. The exhibition, presented within the specific architecture, with the sculpture, paintings, and music was in part, offered in the context of the Gesamtkunstwerk, comparative to a contemporary installation. The exhibition received extensive press, and generated a scandal. Most of the hostile and negative reviews were directed at Gustav Klimt and his murals. However, Klinger&#x27;s sculpture received its criticism as well, some dismissing it as kitsch, while others were offended by seeing Beethoven represented nude. Auguste Rodin attended the exhibition and was reported to have walked past Klinger&#x27;s sculpture without comment, although at a later time he said it had nothing to do with sculpture.

Klinger was cited by many artists (notably Giorgio de Chirico) as being a major link between the symbolist movement of the 19th century and the start of the metaphysical movement. His work was also admired and a formative influence on later artist such as Max Ernst and other surrealist artist. The historian Holger Jacob-Friesen illustrates and discusses in detail the influence of Klinger&#x27;s prints on artist such as Franz von Stuck, Käthe Kollwitz, Edvard Munch, Lovis Corinth, Otto Greiner, Alfred Kubin, Max Slevogt, Paul Klee, Richard Müller, Oskar Kokoschka, Max Beckmann, Horst Janssen, as well as De Chirico and Ernst.

==In contemporary culture==
In Elsa Bernstein&#x27;s naturalist play &quot;Dämmerung&quot;, Klinger is mentioned in the third act when Carl talks of being able to afford &quot;etchings by Klinger&quot; for 80 francs.

Inspection Medical Hermeneutics, an infamous Moscow art collective, based their 1991 installation &quot;Klinger’s Boxes&quot;, on an idea inspired by Klinger&#x27;s &quot;Paraphrase on the Finding of a Glove.&quot;

Asteroid 22369 Klinger is named in his honor.

<text>In mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, a register machine is a generic class of abstract machines, analogous to a Turing machine and thus Turing complete. Unlike a Turing machine that uses a tape and head, a register machine utilizes multiple uniquely addressed registers to store non-negative integers. There are several sub-classes of register machines, including counter machines, pointer machines, random-access machines (RAM), and Random-Access Stored-Program Machine (RASP), each varying in complexity. These machines, particularly in theoretical studies, help in understanding computational processes. The concept of register machines can also be applied to virtual machines in practical computer science, for educational purposes and reducing dependency on specific hardware architectures.

==Overview==
The register machine gets its name from its use of one or more &quot;registers&quot;. In contrast to the tape and head used by a Turing machine, the model uses multiple uniquely addressed registers, each of which holds a single non-negative integer.

There are at least four sub-classes found in the literature. In ascending order of complexity:
* Counter machine – the most primitive and reduced theoretical model of computer hardware. This machine lacks indirect addressing, and instructions are in the finite state machine in the manner of the Harvard architecture.
* Pointer machine – a blend of the counter machine and RAM models with less common and more abstract than either model. Instructions are in the finite state machine in the manner of Harvard architecture.
* Random-access machine (RAM) – a counter machine with indirect addressing and, usually, an augmented instruction set. Instructions are in the finite state machine in the manner of the Harvard architecture.
* Random-access stored-program machine model (RASP) – a RAM with instructions in its registers analogous to the Universal Turing machine, making it an example of the von Neumann architecture. But unlike a computer, the model is &quot;idealized&quot; with effectively infinite registers (and if used, effectively infinite special registers such as accumulators). As compared to a modern computer, however, the instruction set is still reduced in number and complexity.

Any properly defined register machine model is Turing complete. Computational speed is very dependent on the model specifics.

In practical computer science, a related concept known as a virtual machine is occasionally employed to reduce reliance on underlying machine architectures. These virtual machines are also utilized in educational settings. In textbooks, the term &quot;register machine&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably to describe a virtual machine.

== Formal definition ==
A register machine consists of:

#An unbounded number of labelled, discrete, unbounded registers unbounded in extent (capacity): a finite (or infinite in some models) set of registers formula_1 each considered to be of infinite extent and each holding a single non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). The registers may do their own arithmetic, or there may be one or more special registers that do the arithmetic (e.g. an &quot;accumulator&quot; and/or &quot;address register&quot;). &quot;See also Random-access machine.&quot;
#Tally counters or marks: discrete, indistinguishable objects or marks of only one sort suitable for the model. In the most-reduced counter machine model, per each arithmetic operation only one object/mark is either added to or removed from its location/tape. In some counter machine models (e.g. Melzak, Minsky) and most RAM and RASP models more than one object/mark can be added or removed in one operation with &quot;addition&quot; and usually &quot;subtraction&quot;; sometimes with &quot;multiplication&quot; and/or &quot;division&quot;. Some models have control operations such as &quot;copy&quot; (or alternatively: &quot;move&quot;, &quot;load&quot;, &quot;store&quot;) that move &quot;clumps&quot; of objects/marks from register to register in one action.
#A limited set of instructions: the instructions tend to divide into two classes: arithmetic and control. The instructions are drawn from the two classes to form &quot;instruction sets&quot;, such that an instruction set must allow the model to be Turing equivalent (it must be able to compute any partial recursive function).
##Arithmetic: Arithmetic instructions may operate on all registers or on a specific register, such as an accumulator. Typically, they are selected from the following sets, though exceptions exist: Counter machine: { Increment (r), Decrement (r), Clear-to-zero (r) } Reduced RAM, RASP: { Increment (r), Decrement (r), Clear-to-zero (r), Load-immediate-constant k, Add (formula_2), Proper-Subtract (formula_2), Increment accumulator, Decrement accumulator, Clear accumulator, Add the contents of register formula_4 to the accumulator, Proper-Subtract the contents of register formula_4 from the accumulator } Augmented RAM, RASP: Includes all of the reduced instructions as well as: { Multiply, Divide, various Boolean bit-wise operations (left-shift, bit test, etc.) }.
##Control: Counter machine models: Optionally include { Copy (formula_2) }. RAM and RASP models: Most include { Copy (formula_2) }, or { Load Accumulator from formula_4, Store accumulator into formula_4, Load Accumulator with an immediate constant }. All models: Include at least one conditional &quot;jump&quot; (branch, goto) following the test of a register, such as { Jump-if-zero, Jump-if-not-zero (i.e., Jump-if-positive), Jump-if-equal, Jump-if-not-equal }. All models optionally include: { unconditional program jump (goto) }.
##Register-addressing method:
##*Counter machine: no indirect addressing, immediate operands possible in highly atomized models
##*RAM and RASP: indirect addressing available, immediate operands typical
##Input-output: optional in all models
#State register: A special Instruction Register (IR), distinct from the registers mentioned earlier, stores the current instruction to be executed along with its address in the instruction table. This register, along with its associated table, is located within the finite state machine. The IR is inaccessible in all models. In the case of RAM and RASP, for determining the &quot;address&quot; of a register, the model can choose either (i) the address specified by the table and temporarily stored in the IR for direct addressing, or (ii) the contents of the register specified by the instruction in the IR for indirect addressing. It&#x27;s important to note that the IR is not the &quot;program counter&quot; (PC) of the RASP (or conventional computer). The PC is merely another register akin to an accumulator but specifically reserved for holding the number of the RASP&#x27;s current register-based instruction. Thus, a RASP possesses two &quot;instruction/program&quot; registers: (i) the IR (finite state machine&#x27;s Instruction Register), and (ii) a PC (Program Counter) for the program stored in the registers. Additionally, aside from the PC, a RASP may also dedicate another register to the &quot;Program-Instruction Register&quot; (referred to by various names such as &quot;PIR,&quot; &quot;IR,&quot; &quot;PR,&quot; etc.).
#List of labelled instructions, usually in sequential order: A finite list of instructions formula_10. In the case of the counter machine, random-access machine (RAM), and pointer machine, the instruction store is in the &quot;TABLE&quot; of the finite state machine, thus these models are examples of the Harvard architecture. In the case of the RASP, the program store is in the registers, thus this is an example of the Von Neumann architecture. &quot;See also Random-access machine and Random-access stored-program machine.&quot;&lt;br&gt;The instructions are usually listed in sequential order, like computer programs, unless a jump is successful. In this case, the default sequence continues in numerical order. An exception to this is the abacus counter machine models—every instruction has at least one &quot;next&quot; instruction identifier &quot;z&quot;, and the conditional branch has two.
#*Observe also that the abacus model combines two instructions, JZ then DEC: e.g. { INC ( r, z ), JZDEC ( r, ztrue, zfalse ) }.
See McCarthy Formalism for more about the &quot;conditional expression&quot; &quot;IF r=0 THEN ztrue ELSE zfalse&quot;

== Historical development of the register machine model ==
Two trends appeared in the early 1950s. The first was to characterize the computer as a Turing machine. The second was to define computer-like models—models with sequential instruction sequences and conditional jumps—with the power of a Turing machine, a so-called Turing equivalence. Need for this work was carried out in the context of two &quot;hard&quot; problems: the unsolvable word problem posed by Emil Post—his problem of &quot;tag&quot;—and the very &quot;hard&quot; problem of Hilbert&#x27;s problems—the 10th question around Diophantine equations. Researchers were questing for Turing-equivalent models that were less &quot;logical&quot; in nature and more &quot;arithmetic.&quot;

The first step towards characterizing computers originated with Hans Hermes (1954), Rózsa Péter (1958), and Heinz Kaphengst (1959), the second step with Hao Wang (1954, 1957) and, as noted above, furthered along by Zdzislaw Alexander Melzak (1961), Joachim Lambek (1961) and Marvin Minsky (1961, 1967).

The last five names are listed explicitly in that order by Yuri Matiyasevich. He follows up with:
:&quot;&quot;Register machines [some authors use &quot;register machine&quot; synonymous with &quot;counter-machine&quot;] are particularly suitable for constructing Diophantine equations. Like Turing machines, they have very primitive instructions and, in addition, they deal with numbers&quot;&quot;.

Lambek, Melzak, Minsky, Shepherdson and Sturgis independently discovered the same idea at the same time. See note on precedence below.

The history begins with Wang&#x27;s model.

=== Wang&#x27;s (1954, 1957) model: Post–Turing machine ===
Wang&#x27;s work followed from Emil Post&#x27;s (1936) paper and led Wang to his definition of his Wang B-machine—a two-symbol Post–Turing machine computation model with only four atomic instructions:
 { LEFT, RIGHT, PRINT, JUMP_if_marked_to_instruction_z }
To these four both Wang (1954, 1957) and then C. Y. Lee (1961) added another instruction from the Post set { ERASE }, and then a Post&#x27;s unconditional jump { JUMP_to_ instruction_z } (or to make things easier, the conditional jump JUMP_IF_blank_to_instruction_z, or both. Lee named this a &quot;W-machine&quot; model:
 { LEFT, RIGHT, PRINT, ERASE, JUMP_if_marked, [maybe JUMP or JUMP_IF_blank] }
Wang expressed hope that his model would be &quot;a rapprochement&quot; between the theory of Turing machines and the practical world of the computer.

Wang&#x27;s work was highly influential. We find him referenced by Minsky (1961) and (1967), Melzak (1961), Shepherdson and Sturgis (1963). Indeed, Shepherdson and Sturgis (1963) remark that:
:&quot;...we have tried to carry a step further the &#x27;rapprochement&#x27; between the practical and theoretical aspects of computation suggested by Wang,&quot;

Martin Davis eventually evolved this model into the (2-symbol) Post–Turing machine.

Difficulties with the Wang/Post–Turing model:

Except there was a problem: the Wang model (the six instructions of the 7-instruction Post–Turing machine) was still a single-tape Turing-like device, however nice its &quot;sequential program instruction-flow&quot; might be. Both Melzak (1961) and Shepherdson and Sturgis (1963) observed this (in the context of certain proofs and investigations):

:&quot;&quot;...a Turing machine has a certain opacity... a Turing machine is slow in (hypothetical) operation and, usually, complicated. This makes it rather hard to design it, and even harder to investigate such matters as time or storage optimization or a comparison between the efficiency of two algorithms. &quot;...although not difficult... proofs are complicated and tedious to follow for two reasons: (1) A Turing machine has only a head so that one is obliged to break down the computation into very small steps of operations on a single digit. (2) It has only one tape so that one has to go to some trouble to find the number one wishes to work on and keep it separate from other numbers&quot;&quot;

Indeed, as examples in Turing machine examples, Post–Turing machine and partial functions show, the work can be &quot;complicated&quot;.
===Minsky, Melzak–Lambek and Shepherdson–Sturgis models &quot;cut the tape&quot; into many===

Initial thought leads to &#x27;cutting the tape&#x27; so that each is infinitely long (to accommodate any size integer) but left-ended. These three tapes are called &quot;Post–Turing (i.e. Wang-like) tapes&quot;. The individual heads move to the left (for decrementing) and to the right (for incrementing). In a sense, the heads indicate &quot;the top of the stack&quot; of concatenated marks. Or in Minsky (1961) and Hopcroft and Ullman (1979), the tape is always blank except for a mark at the left end—at no time does a head ever print or erase.

Care must be taken to write the instructions so that a test for zero and a jump occur &quot;before&quot; decrementing, otherwise the machine will &quot;fall off the end&quot; or &quot;bump against the end&quot;—creating an instance of a partial function. 

Minsky (1961) and Shepherdson–Sturgis (1963) prove that only a few tapes—as few as one—still allow the machine to be Turing equivalent if the data on the tape is represented as a Gödel number (or some other uniquely encodable Encodable-decodable number); this number will evolve as the computation proceeds. In the one tape version with Gödel number encoding the counter machine must be able to (i) multiply the Gödel number by a constant (numbers &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;), and (ii) divide by a constant (numbers &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;) and jump if the remainder is zero. Minsky (1967) shows that the need for this bizarre instruction set can be relaxed to { INC (r), JZDEC (r, z) } and the convenience instructions { CLR (r), J (r) } if two tapes are available. However, a simple Gödelization is still required. A similar result appears in Elgot–Robinson (1964) with respect to their RASP model.

=== Melzak&#x27;s (1961) model is different: clumps of pebbles go into and out of holes ===
Melzak&#x27;s (1961) model is significantly different. He took his own model, flipped the tapes vertically, called them &quot;holes in the ground&quot; to be filled with &quot;pebble counters&quot;. Unlike Minsky&#x27;s &quot;increment&quot; and &quot;decrement&quot;, Melzak allowed for proper subtraction of any count of pebbles and &quot;adds&quot; of any count of pebbles.

He defines indirect addressing for his model and provides two examples of its use; his &quot;proof&quot; that his model is Turing equivalent is so sketchy that the reader cannot tell whether or not he intended the indirect addressing to be a requirement for the proof.

Legacy of Melzak&#x27;s model is Lambek&#x27;s simplification and the reappearance of his mnemonic conventions in Cook and Reckhow 1973.

=== Lambek (1961) atomizes Melzak&#x27;s model into the Minsky (1961) model: INC and DEC-with-test ===
Lambek (1961) took Melzak&#x27;s ternary model and atomized it down to the two unary instructions—X+, X− if possible else jump—exactly the same two that Minsky (1961) had come up with.

However, like the Minsky (1961) model, the Lambek model does execute its instructions in a default-sequential manner—both X+ and X− carry the identifier of the next instruction, and X− also carries the jump-to instruction if the zero-test is successful.

=== Elgot–Robinson (1964) and the problem of the RASP without indirect addressing ===
A RASP or random-access stored-program machine begins as a counter machine with its &quot;program of instruction&quot; placed in its &quot;registers&quot;. Analogous to, but independent of, the finite state machine&#x27;s &quot;Instruction Register&quot;, at least one of the registers (nicknamed the &quot;program counter&quot; (PC)) and one or more &quot;temporary&quot; registers maintain a record of, and operate on, the current instruction&#x27;s number. The finite state machine&#x27;s TABLE of instructions is responsible for (i) fetching the current &quot;program&quot; instruction from the proper register, (ii) parsing the &quot;program&quot; instruction, (iii) fetching operands specified by the &quot;program&quot; instruction, and (iv) executing the &quot;program&quot; instruction.

Except there is a problem: If based on the &quot;counter machine&quot; chassis this computer-like, von Neumann machine will not be Turing equivalent. It cannot compute everything that is computable. Intrinsically the model is bounded by the size of its (very-) &quot;finite&quot; state machine&#x27;s instructions. The counter machine based RASP can compute any primitive recursive function (e.g. multiplication) but not all mu recursive functions (e.g. the Ackermann function).

Elgot–Robinson investigate the possibility of allowing their RASP model to &quot;self modify&quot; its program instructions. The idea was an old one, proposed by Burks–Goldstine–von Neumann (1946–1947), and sometimes called &quot;the computed goto&quot;. Melzak (1961) specifically mentions the &quot;computed goto&quot; by name but instead provides his model with indirect addressing.

Computed goto: A RASP &quot;program&quot; of instructions that modifies the &quot;goto address&quot; in a conditional- or unconditional-jump &quot;program&quot; instruction.

But this does not solve the problem (unless one resorts to Gödel numbers). What is necessary is a method to fetch the address of a program instruction that lies (far) &quot;beyond/above&quot; the upper bound of the &quot;finite&quot; state machine instruction register and TABLE.

:Example: A counter machine equipped with only four unbounded registers can e.g. multiply any two numbers ( m, n ) together to yield p—and thus be a primitive recursive function—no matter how large the numbers m and n; moreover, less than 20 instructions are required to do this! e.g. { 1: CLR ( p ), 2: JZ ( m, done ), 3 outer_loop: JZ ( n, done ), 4: CPY ( m, temp ), 5: inner_loop: JZ ( m, outer_loop ), 6: DEC ( m ), 7: INC ( p ), 8: J ( inner_loop ), 9: outer_loop: DEC ( n ), 10 J ( outer_loop ), HALT } However, with only 4 registers, this machine has not nearly big enough to build a RASP that can execute the multiply algorithm as a &quot;program&quot;. No matter how big we build our finite state machine there will always be a &quot;program&quot; (including its parameters) which is larger. So by definition the bounded program machine that does not use unbounded encoding tricks such as Gödel numbers cannot be &quot;universal&quot;.

Minsky (1967) hints at the issue in his investigation of a counter machine (he calls them &quot;program computer models&quot;) equipped with the instructions { CLR (r), INC (r), and RPT (&quot;a&quot; times the instructions m to n) }. He doesn&#x27;t tell us how to fix the problem, but he does observe that:
: &quot;... the program computer has to have some way to keep track of how many RPT&#x27;s remain to be done, and this might exhaust any particular amount of storage allowed in the finite part of the computer. RPT operations require infinite registers of their own, in general, and they must be treated differently from the other kinds of operations we have considered.&quot;

But Elgot and Robinson solve the problem: They augment their P0 RASP with an indexed set of instructions—a somewhat more complicated (but more flexible) form of indirect addressing. Their P&#x27;0 model addresses the registers by adding the contents of the &quot;base&quot; register (specified in the instruction) to the &quot;index&quot; specified explicitly in the instruction (or vice versa, swapping &quot;base&quot; and &quot;index&quot;). Thus the indexing P&#x27;0 instructions have one more parameter than the non-indexing P0 instructions:
: Example: INC ( rbase, index ) ; effective address will be [rbase] + index, where the natural number &quot;index&quot; is derived from the finite-state machine instruction itself.

=== Hartmanis (1971) ===
By 1971, Hartmanis has simplified the indexing to indirection for use in his RASP model.

Indirect addressing: A pointer-register supplies the finite state machine with the address of the target register required for the instruction. Said another way: The &quot;contents&quot; of the pointer-register is the &quot;address&quot; of the &quot;target&quot; register to be used by the instruction. If the pointer-register is unbounded, the RAM, and a suitable RASP built on its chassis, will be Turing equivalent. The target register can serve either as a source or destination register, as specified by the instruction.

Note that the finite state machine does not have to explicitly specify this target register&#x27;s address. It just says to the rest of the machine: Get me the contents of the register pointed to by my pointer-register and then do xyz with it. It must specify explicitly by name, via its instruction, this pointer-register (e.g. &quot;N&quot;, or &quot;72&quot; or &quot;PC&quot;, etc.) but it doesn&#x27;t have to know what number the pointer-register actually contains (perhaps 279,431).

=== Cook and Reckhow (1973) describe the RAM ===
Cook and Reckhow (1973) cite Hartmanis (1971) and simplify his model to what they call a random-access machine (RAM—i.e. a machine with indirection and the Harvard architecture). In a sense we are back to Melzak (1961) but with a much simpler model than Melzak&#x27;s.

== Precedence ==
Minsky was working at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and published his work there; his paper was received for publishing in the &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; on 15 August 1960, but not published until November 1961. While receipt occurred a full year before the work of Melzak and Lambek was received and published (received, respectively, May and 15 June 1961, and published side-by-side September 1961). That (i) both were Canadians and published in the Canadian Mathematical Bulletin, (ii) neither would have had reference to Minsky&#x27;s work because it was not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, but (iii) Melzak references Wang, and Lambek references Melzak, leads one to hypothesize that their work occurred simultaneously and independently.

Almost exactly the same thing happened to Shepherdson and Sturgis. Their paper was received in December 1961—just a few months after Melzak and Lambek&#x27;s work was received. Again, they had little (at most 1 month) or no benefit of reviewing the work of Minsky. They were careful to observe in footnotes that papers by Ershov, Kaphengst and Péter had &quot;recently appeared&quot; These were published much earlier but appeared in the German language in German journals so issues of accessibility present themselves.

The final paper of Shepherdson and Sturgis did not appear in a peer-reviewed journal until 1963. And as they note in their Appendix A, the &#x27;systems&#x27; of Kaphengst (1959), Ershov (1958), and Péter (1958) are all so similar to what results were obtained later as to be indistinguishable to a set of the following:
: produce 0 i.e. 0 → n
: increment a number i.e. n+1 → n
::&quot;i.e. of performing the operations which generate the natural numbers&quot;
: copy a number i.e. n → m
: to &quot;change the course of a computation&quot;, either comparing two numbers or decrementing until 0

Indeed, Shepherson and Sturgis conclude:
::&quot;The various minimal systems are very similar&quot;

By order of &quot;publishing&quot; date the work of Kaphengst (1959), Ershov (1958), Péter (1958) were first.

== Bibliography ==
Background texts: The following bibliography of source papers includes a number of texts to be used as background. The mathematics that led to the flurry of papers about abstract machines in the 1950s and 1960s can be found in van Heijenoort (1967)—an assemblage of original papers spanning the 50 years from Frege (1879) to Gödel (1931). Davis (ed.) &quot;The Undecidable&quot; (1965) carries the torch onward beginning with Gödel (1931) through Gödel&#x27;s (1964) postscriptum; the original papers of Alan Turing (1936–1937) and Emil Post (1936) are included in &quot;The Undecidable&quot;. The mathematics of Church, Rosser, and Kleene that appear as reprints of original papers in &quot;The Undecidable&quot; is carried further in Kleene (1952), a mandatory text for anyone pursuing a deeper understanding of the mathematics behind the machines. Both Kleene (1952) and Davis (1958) are referenced by a number of the papers.

For a good treatment of the counter machine see Minsky (1967) Chapter 11 &quot;Models similar to Digital Computers&quot;—he calls the counter machine a &quot;program computer&quot;. A recent overview is found at van Emde Boas (1990). A recent treatment of the Minsky (1961)/Lambek (1961) model can be found Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002); they reincarnate Lambek&#x27;s &quot;abacus model&quot; to demonstrate equivalence of Turing machines and partial recursive functions, and they provide a graduate-level introduction to both abstract machine models (counter- and Turing-) and the mathematics of recursion theory. Beginning with the first edition Boolos–Burgess (1970) this model appeared with virtually the same treatment.

The papers: The papers begin with Wang (1957) and his dramatic simplification of the Turing machine. Turing (1936), Kleene (1952), Davis (1958), and in particular Post (1936) are cited in Wang (1957); in turn, Wang is referenced by Melzak (1961), Minsky (1961), and Shepherdson–Sturgis (1961–1963) as they independently reduce the Turing tapes to &quot;counters&quot;. Melzak (1961) provides his pebble-in-holes counter machine model with indirection but doesn&#x27;t carry the treatment further. The work of Elgot–Robinson (1964) define the RASP—the computer-like random-access stored-program machines—and appear to be the first to investigate the failure of the bounded counter machine to calculate the mu-recursive functions. This failure—except with the draconian use of Gödel numbers in the manner of Minsky (1961)—leads to their definition of &quot;indexed&quot; instructions (i.e. indirect addressing) for their RASP model. Elgot–Robinson (1964) and more so Hartmanis (1971) investigate RASPs with self-modifying programs. Hartmanis (1971) specifies an instruction set with indirection, citing lecture notes of Cook (1970). For use in investigations of computational complexity Cook and his graduate student Reckhow (1973) provide the definition of a RAM (their model and mnemonic convention are similar to Melzak&#x27;s, but offer him no reference in the paper). The pointer machines are an offshoot of Knuth (1968, 1973) and independently Schönhage (1980).

For the most part the papers contain mathematics beyond the undergraduate level—in particular the primitive recursive functions and mu recursive functions presented elegantly in Kleene (1952) and less in depth, but useful nonetheless, in Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002). 

All texts and papers excepting the four starred have been witnessed. These four are written in German and appear as references in Shepherdson–Sturgis (1963) and Elgot–Robinson (1964); Shepherdson–Sturgis (1963) offer a brief discussion of their results in Shepherdson–Sturgis&#x27; Appendix A. The terminology of at least one paper (Kaphengst (1959) seems to hark back to the Burke–Goldstine–von Neumann (1946–1947) analysis of computer architecture.

<text>Albert William Lee (born 21 December 1943) is an English guitarist known for his fingerstyle and hybrid picking technique. Lee has worked, both in the studio and on tour, with many famous musicians from a wide range of genres. He has also maintained a solo career and is a noted composer and musical director.

==Early life==
Lee was born in Lingen, Herefordshire, but grew up in Blackheath, London, a member of a Romani family. His father was a musician, and Lee studied piano, taking up the instrument at age seven.

During this time, Lee became a fan of Buddy Holly and Jerry Lee Lewis. He took up guitar in 1958 when his parents bought him a second-hand Höfner &quot;President&quot; which he later traded in for a Czechoslovak Jolana &quot;Grazioso&quot;, the forerunner of the &quot;Futurama&quot;. Lee left school at the age of 16 to play full-time.

==Career==

===Early career===
Lee was with a variety of bands from 1959 onwards, playing mostly R&amp;B, country music and rock and roll. He was accompanying Richard Kneller, (Dickie Pride), in the Castle Pub, Tooting, the night Russ Conway saw him perform there, two weeks before taking Larry Parnes to see Pride. 
In addition to Buddy Holly, his early guitar influences included Cliff Gallup, Grady Martin, the Everly Brothers, Scotty Moore, James Burton and Jerry Reed. Lee first experienced commercial success as the lead guitarist with Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds. Lee says that he enjoyed playing the Stax-type material, but he really wanted to play country music. Consequently, he left Farlowe and the Thunderbirds in 1968.

During his time playing with Heads Hands &amp; Feet, Lee became a &quot;guitar hero&quot;, playing his Fender Telecaster at breakneck speed. Heads Hands &amp; Feet became a popular live band in the UK, making appearances on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and also in Europe, where they appeared on the German music programme &quot;Beat-Club&quot;. In October 1969 Country Fever, an RCA package toured six countries in eleven days, starting at the Nashville Room with the London band the Kingpins.

===International success===
In 1971, Lee performed with Deep Purple&#x27;s keyboard player Jon Lord on the studio recording of Lord&#x27;s &quot;Gemini Suite&quot;. That opus was a follow-up to Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;. Ritchie Blackmore had played guitar at the first live performance of the &quot;Gemini Suite&quot; in September 1970, but declined the invitation to appear on the studio version, which led to the involvement of Lee. Other performers were Yvonne Elliman, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, Tony Ashton and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Malcolm Arnold.

Lee left for Los Angeles in 1974 and, through his friend bassist Ric Grech (of Blind Faith), did some session work on three albums with the Crickets who also at the time included Sonny Curtis and Jerry Allison. One of these releases is titled &quot;A Long Way From Lubbock&quot;. Lee also received many other offers of session work. In 1976, he was asked to join Emmylou Harris&#x27;s Hot Band, replacing one of his heroes, James Burton, who was returning to perform with Elvis Presley. The Hot Band featured other musicians including Ricky Skaggs and Rodney Crowell. Starting in 1978, Lee worked for five years with Eric Clapton, which included playing and singing for a live concert recording at the Budokan in Japan.

Lee was responsible for the Everly Brothers&#x27; 1983 reunion concert and was its musical director. He played regularly with the Everlys for over twenty years.

In 1987, Lee was invited by Gerry Hogan to headline at a steel guitar festival in Newbury, Berkshire. Lee was at first intimidated by the prospect of having to front a band; however, the gig was successful and he toured as Albert Lee &amp; Hogan’s Heroes on a regular basis until 2015. The lineup of the band included British musicians Peter Baron on drums, Gerry Hogan on guitar and Brian Hodgson on bass. Pete Wingfield was the original keyboard player, before leaving to be replaced by Elio Pace and later Gavin Povey. 

They were renowned for attracting celebrities to their gigs. Stars such as Eric Clapton, Tommy Emmanuel, Lonnie Donegan, Dave Edmunds, Nick Lowe, Marty Wilde, Willie Nelson, Nanci Griffith, Don Everly, Emmylou Harris, Sonny Curtis and Rodney Crowell have all jammed with the band at one time or another. In 1988 Lee toured Australia along with Vince Gill, then a comparative unknown, and has returned to tour the country on several subsequent occasions.

In the early 2000s Albert Lee toured with Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings. In 2002, Lee appeared at the Concert for George [Harrison]. Also in 2002, Lee received a Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance for &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; from the CD &quot;Earl Scruggs and Friends&quot;. In September 2006 Lee took part in &quot;Primal Twang: The Legacy of the Guitar&quot;, a documentary about the history of the guitar. Lee appeared at the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival on 28 July and performed with Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings at the Ahmet Ertegun tribute show at The O2 in London on 10 December. A new album entitled &quot;Like This&quot; was released in spring 2008 to coincide with their European tour. He lives in Malibu, California.

==Awards and legacy==

Lee has received many awards as a guitarist, winning five consecutive times &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Country Guitarist&quot;. Lee is known within the music industry for his speed of playing and his technical virtuosity and yet by the same token, one of the most melodic, playing slower passages approximating the sound of the pedal steel guitar with his Music Man and Telecaster guitars which are equipped with B-Benders.

He is known as &quot;the guitar player&#x27;s guitar player&quot;. Lee is also referred to as &quot;Mr. Telecaster&quot;. A long-time Telecaster player, Lee wrote a foreword to A.R. Duchossoir&#x27;s book detailing the history of the instrument.

Lee&#x27;s song &quot;Country Boy&quot; helped to redefine country guitar for a whole generation of players, and was later to become a hit for multi-instrumentalist Ricky Skaggs.

Despite positive press from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Lee has never achieved any great commercial success in terms of record sales during his career, but more as a live performer, session player and sideman, perhaps due to his self-effacing stage presence. Lee has been described by his peers, who include Jimmy Page and Ritchie Blackmore, as a complete gentleman who does not know the meaning of the word &quot;ego&quot;.

After Gram Parsons&#x27; death, Emmylou Harris was told that she could gain the backing of a major record label only if she could assemble a really &quot;hot band&quot;. Harris did just that, enlisting guitarist James Burton and pianist Glen Hardin, both of whom had played with Elvis Presley and Parsons; she named the band &quot;The Hot Band&quot;. When Burton left to return to Elvis Presley, Lee was his replacement. Harris said of him that Lee is &quot;a brilliant guitar player. His sound is unmistakable—often emulated, never equaled. When Saint Peter asks me to chronicle my time down here on earth, I&#x27;ll be able to say (with pride if that&#x27;s allowed) that for a while I played rhythm guitar in a band with Albert Lee.&quot;

In 2017, Lee was honoured with the Trailblazer Lifetime Achievement Award at the UK Americana Awards.

== Guitar collection ==
Albert Lee owns around 40 guitars, including Don Everly&#x27;s Gibson J-200. The Gibson Guitar Corporation made one for Don Everly and the other for Phil. The guitars have an all black, high-gloss lacquered finish and are equipped with twin &quot;Everly Brothers&quot; white pickguards. The Everly Brothers&#x27; manager Wesley Rose had wanted the guitar to be presented to the Country Music Hall of Fame, but Everly informed him that guitars like that should be played, not kept sitting in a glass case. Don Everly presented it to Lee, along with his Gibson &quot;Everly Brothers&quot; model.

Eric Clapton gave Lee the Gibson Les Paul Custom that he played while with Delaney and Bonnie. Lee also plays his signature Music Man (the guitar shown in the photographs) and a 1950s Telecaster (and has versions of both with custom B-Benders), a 1958 Stratocaster and a Martin 000-28 acoustic.

Despite his being heavily associated with the Fender Telecaster, guitar manufacturer Ernie Ball Music Man makes a signature Albert Lee guitar, which unlike typical Telecasters is offered with three single-coil or two humbucker pickups.

<doc id="505225" wikidata="Q1502167" url="?curid=505225" title="Iterated function system">
<text>In mathematics, iterated function systems (IFSs) are a method of constructing fractals; the resulting fractals are often self-similar. IFS fractals are more related to set theory than fractal geometry. They were introduced in 1981.

IFS fractals, as they are normally called, can be of any number of dimensions, but are commonly computed and drawn in 2D. The fractal is made up of the union of several copies of itself, each copy being transformed by a function (hence &quot;function system&quot;). The canonical example is the Sierpiński triangle. The functions are normally contractive, which means they bring points closer together and make shapes smaller. Hence, the shape of an IFS fractal is made up of several possibly-overlapping smaller copies of itself, each of which is also made up of copies of itself, ad infinitum. This is the source of its self-similar fractal nature.

==Definition==
Formally, an iterated function system is a finite set of contraction mappings on a complete metric space. Symbolically,
:formula_1
is an iterated function system if each formula_2 is a contraction on the complete metric space formula_3.

==Properties==
Hutchinson showed that, for the metric space formula_4, or more generally, for a complete metric space formula_3, such a system of functions has a unique nonempty compact (closed and bounded) fixed set &quot;S&quot;. One way of constructing a fixed set is to start with an initial nonempty closed and bounded set &quot;S&quot;0 and iterate the actions of the &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;, taking &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 to be the union of the images of &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; under the &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;; then taking &quot;S&quot; to be the closure of the limit formula_6. Symbolically, the unique fixed (nonempty compact) set formula_7 has the property
:formula_8
The set &quot;S&quot; is thus the fixed set of the Hutchinson operator formula_9 defined for formula_10 via
:formula_11

The existence and uniqueness of &quot;S&quot; is a consequence of the contraction mapping principle, as is the fact that
:formula_12
for any nonempty compact set formula_13 in formula_3. (For contractive IFS this convergence takes place even for any nonempty closed bounded set formula_13). Random elements arbitrarily close to &quot;S&quot; may be obtained by the &quot;chaos game,&quot; described below.

Recently it was shown that the IFSs of non-contractive type (i.e. composed of maps that are not contractions with respect to any topologically equivalent metric in &quot;X&quot;) can yield attractors.
These arise naturally in projective spaces, though classical irrational rotation on the circle can be adapted too.

The collection of functions formula_2 generates a monoid under composition. If there are only two such functions, the monoid can be visualized as a binary tree, where, at each node of the tree, one may compose with the one or the other function (&quot;i.e.&quot; take the left or the right branch). In general, if there are &quot;k&quot; functions, then one may visualize the monoid as a full &quot;k&quot;-ary tree, also known as a Cayley tree.

==Constructions==


Sometimes each function formula_2 is required to be a linear, or more generally an affine, transformation, and hence represented by a matrix. However, IFSs may also be built from non-linear functions, including projective transformations and Möbius transformations. The Fractal flame is an example of an IFS with nonlinear functions.

The most common algorithm to compute IFS fractals is called the &quot;chaos game&quot;. It consists of picking a random point in the plane, then iteratively applying one of the functions chosen at random from the function system to transform the point to get a next point. An alternative algorithm is to generate each possible sequence of functions up to a given maximum length, and then to plot the results of applying each of these sequences of functions to an initial point or shape.

Each of these algorithms provides a global construction which generates points distributed across the whole fractal. If a small area of the fractal is being drawn, many of these points will fall outside of the screen boundaries. This makes zooming into an IFS construction drawn in this manner impractical.

Although the theory of IFS requires each function to be contractive, in practice software that implements IFS only require that the whole system be contractive on average.

==Partitioned iterated function systems==

PIFS (partitioned iterated function systems), also called local iterated function systems, give surprisingly good image compression, even for photographs that don&#x27;t seem to have the kinds of self-similar structure shown by simple IFS fractals.

==The inverse problem==
Very fast algorithms exist to generate an image from a set of IFS or PIFS parameters. It is faster and requires much less storage space to store a description of how it was created, transmit that description to a destination device, and regenerate that image anew on the destination device, than to store and transmit the color of each pixel in the image.

The inverse problem is more difficult: given some original arbitrary digital image such as a digital photograph, try to find a set of IFS parameters which, when evaluated by iteration, produces another image visually similar to the original.
In 1989, Arnaud Jacquin presented a solution to a restricted form of the inverse problem using only PIFS; the general form of the inverse problem remains unsolved.

As of 1995, all fractal compression software is based on Jacquin&#x27;s approach.

==Examples==
The diagram shows the construction on an IFS from two affine functions. The functions are represented by their effect on the bi-unit square (the function transforms the outlined square into the shaded square). The combination of the two functions forms the Hutchinson operator. Three iterations of the operator are shown, and then the final image is of the fixed point, the final fractal.

Early examples of fractals which may be generated by an IFS include the Cantor set, first described in 1884; and de Rham curves, a type of self-similar curve described by Georges de Rham in 1957.

==History==
IFSs were conceived in their present form by John E. Hutchinson in 1981 and popularized by Michael Barnsley&#x27;s book &quot;Fractals Everywhere&quot;.

<text>Makrinitsa (), nicknamed &quot;balcony of Mt. Pelion,&quot; is a village and a former community in Magnesia, Thessaly, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Volos, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 59.903 km2.

==Name==
The name is first attested in the early 13th century through the Makrinitissa Monastery. &quot;Makrinitissa&quot; itself is a more scholarly form of &quot;Makrinitsa&quot;, which must have been the colloquial name even at the time. It is of Slavic origin, originally &quot;Mokrinitsa&quot;, a diminutive form of &quot;Mokrina&quot;, &quot;wet place&quot;, referring to the water-rich environs of the village. The name was Hellenized with the change of the first vowel to &quot;a&quot; from the Greek word &quot;makrys&quot;, &quot;long&quot;.

==Location==
It is situated in the northwestern part of the Pelion mountains, 6 km northeast of Volos. One of the most characteristic traditional settlements, full of mansions and houses that look like hanging ornaments on the green mountain side. One of the traditional coffee houses is decorated with a fresco by the famous Greek painter Theofilos. The picturesque cobbled paths of Makrinitsa are scattered with traditional water fountains. Makrinitsa is a popular tourist destination, especially during the winter.

The village is the home of the Museum of Folk Art and History of Pelion, housed in the historic Topali Mansion, with over 1,500 objects related to the folk culture and everyday life of the region.

<doc id="505237" wikidata="Q5157339" url="?curid=505237" title="Computational semiotics">
<text>Computational semiotics is an interdisciplinary field that applies, conducts, and draws on research in logic, mathematics, the theory and practice of computation, formal and natural language studies, the cognitive sciences generally, and semiotics proper. The term encompasses both the application of semiotics to computer hardware and software design and, conversely, the use of computation for performing semiotic analysis. The former focuses on what semiotics can bring to computation; the latter on what computation can bring to semiotics.

== Semiotics of computation ==
A common theme of this work is the adoption of a sign-theoretic perspective on issues of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation. Many of its applications lie in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and fundamental devices of recognition.

One part of this field, known as algebraic semiotics, combines aspects of algebraic specification and social semiotics, and has been applied to user interface design and to the representation of mathematical proofs.

== Computational methods for semiotics ==
This strand involves formalizing semiotic methods of analysis and implementing them as algorithms on computers to process large digital data sets. These data sets are typically textual but semiotics opens the way for analysis of all manner of other data. Existing work provides methods for automated opposition analysis and generation of semiotic squares; metaphor identification; and image analysis. Shackell has suggested that a new field of Natural Semiotic Processing should emerge to extend natural language processing into areas such as persuasive technology, marketing and brand analysis that have significant cultural or non-linguistic aspects. On the other side, Meunier argues that semiotics and computation are compatible and combining them provides more logical consistency in understanding forms of meaning.

<doc id="505238" wikidata="Q5477494" url="?curid=505238" title="Fractal flame">
<text>Fractal flames are a member of the iterated function system class of fractals created by Scott Draves in 1992. Draves&#x27; open-source code was later ported into Adobe After Effects graphics software and translated into the Apophysis fractal flame editor.

Fractal flames differ from ordinary iterated function systems in three ways:
* Nonlinear functions are iterated in addition to affine transforms.
* Log-density display instead of linear or binary (a form of tone mapping)
* Color by structure (i.e. by the recursive path taken) instead of monochrome or by density.

The tone mapping and coloring are designed to display as much of the detail of the fractal as possible, which generally results in a more aesthetically pleasing image.

== Algorithm ==

The algorithm consists of two steps: creating a histogram and then rendering the histogram.

===Creating the histogram===

First, one iterates a set of functions, starting from a randomly chosen point &quot;P = (P.x,P.y,P.c)&quot;, where the third coordinate indicates the current color of the point.

:Set of flame functions: formula_1

In each iteration, choose one of the functions above where the probability that &quot;Fj&quot; is chosen is &quot;pj&quot;. Then one computes the next iteration of &quot;P&quot; by applying &quot;Fj&quot; on &quot;(P.x,P.y)&quot;.

Each individual function has the following form:

:formula_2

where the parameter &quot;wk&quot; is called the weight of the variation &quot;Vk&quot;. Draves suggests
 that all formula_3:s are non-negative and sum to one, but implementations such as Apophysis do not impose that restriction.

The functions &quot;Vk&quot; are a set of predefined functions. 
A few examples are

* V0(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) (Linear)
* V1(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = (sin &quot;x&quot;,sin &quot;y&quot;) (Sinusoidal)
* V2(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;)/(&quot;x&quot;2+&quot;y&quot;2) (Spherical)

The color &quot;P.c&quot; of the point is blended with the color associated with the latest applied function &quot;Fj&quot;:

: P.c := (P.c + (Fj)color) / 2

After each iteration, one updates the histogram at the point corresponding to &quot;(P.x,P.y)&quot;. This is done as follows:
histogram[x][y][FREQUENCY] := histogram[x][y][FREQUENCY]+1
histogram[x][y][COLOR] := (histogram[x][y][COLOR] + P.c)/2
The colors in the image will therefore reflect what functions were used to get to that part of the image.

===Rendering an image===

To increase the quality of the image, one can use supersampling to decrease the noise. This involves creating a histogram larger than the image so each pixel has multiple data points to pull from. For example, create a histogram with 300×300 cells in order to draw a 100×100 px image; each pixel would use a 3×3 group of histogram buckets to calculate its value.

For each pixel &quot;(x,y)&quot; in the final image, do the following computations:
frequency_avg[x][y] := average_of_histogram_cells_frequency(x,y);
color_avg[x][y] := average_of_histogram_cells_color(x,y);

alpha[x][y] := log(frequency_avg[x][y]) / log(frequency_max); 
//frequency_max is the maximal number of iterations that hit a cell in the histogram.

final_pixel_color[x][y] := color_avg[x][y] * alpha[x][y]^(1/gamma); //gamma is a value greater than 1.
The algorithm above uses gamma correction to make the colors appear brighter. This is implemented in for example the Apophysis software.

To increase the quality even more, one can use gamma correction on each individual color channel, but this is a very heavy computation, since the &quot;log&quot; function is slow.

A simplified algorithm would be to let the brightness be linearly dependent on the frequency:
final_pixel_color[x][y] := color_avg[x][y] * frequency_avg[x][y]/frequency_max;

but this would make some parts of the fractal lose detail, which is undesirable.

==Density Estimation==

The flame algorithm is like a Monte Carlo simulation, with the flame quality directly proportional to the number of iterations of the simulation. The noise that results from this stochastic sampling can be reduced by blurring the image, to get a smoother result in less time. One does not however want to lose resolution in the parts of the image that receive many samples and so have little noise.

This problem can be solved with adaptive density estimation to increase image quality while keeping render times to a minimum. FLAM3 uses a simplification of the methods presented in *Adaptive Filtering for Progressive Monte Carlo Image Rendering*, a paper presented at WSCG 2000 by Frank Suykens and Yves D. Willems. The idea is to vary the width of the filter inversely proportional to the number of samples available.

As a result, areas with few samples and high noise become blurred and smoothed, but areas with many samples and low noise are left unaffected.

Not all Flame implementations use density estimation.

<text>Thea Gabriele von Harbou (27 December 1888 – 1 July 1954) was a German screenwriter, novelist, film director, and actress. She is remembered as the screenwriter of the science fiction film classic &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) and for the 1925 novel on which it was based. von Harbou collaborated as a screenwriter with film director Fritz Lang, her husband, during the period of transition from silent to sound films.

==Early life, family, and education==
Thea von Harbou was born in Tauperlitz (now part of Döhlau), Bavaria, in 1888, into a family of minor nobility and government officials, which gave her a level of sophisticated comfort. As a child, she was educated in a convent by private tutors who taught her several languages as well as piano and violin. She was a child prodigy.

Her first works, a short story published in a magazine and a volume of poems published privately, focused on perceptions of art, subjects considered unusual for a girl of thirteen. Despite her privileged childhood, von Harbou wanted to earn a living on her own, which led her to become an actress despite her father&#x27;s disapproval.

==From novelist to screenwriter==
After her debut in 1906, von Harbou met actor Rudolf Klein-Rogge and married him during World War I. By 1917, she and Klein-Rogge had moved to Berlin where von Harbou devoted herself to building her career as a writer. She was drawn to writing epic myths and legends with an overtly nationalistic tone. In one historian&#x27;s estimation: &quot;Her novels became patriotic and morale-boosting, urging women to sacrifice and duty while promoting the eternal glory of the fatherland&quot;.

Her first close interaction with cinema came when German director Joe May decided to adapt a piece of her fiction, &quot;Die heilige Simplizia&quot;. From that moment forward, &quot;Her fiction output slowed down. In short order she would become one of Germany&#x27;s most celebrated film writers, not only because of her partnership with Fritz Lang, but also for writing scripts for F. W. Murnau, Carl Dreyer, E. A. Dupont, and other German luminaries&quot;.

Her brother, Horst von Harbou, worked for Universum Film as a photographer and began to work closely with Thea and Fritz Lang on many of their most famous productions.

==Partnership with Lang==
Thea von Harbou&#x27;s first collaboration with Fritz Lang was marked by a common interest in India. As von Harbou worked on an adaptation of her novel &quot;The Indian Tomb&quot; (&quot;Das indische Grabmal&quot;, 1918), Joe May assigned Lang to help her write the screenplay and work out production details. Praising Harbou&#x27;s skills, Erich Kettelhut recalled: &quot;She was not only well-liked by her colleagues, but also as much a creative force, as highly motivated and smoothly efficient, as her husband. Her loving personality was crucial to the professional teamwork. von Harbou&#x27;s ability to reach out to people and find compromise in the worst situations was a vital resource.&quot;
von Harbou and Lang began an affair during this time; she divorced Klein-Rogge in 1920. Following the success of &quot;Dr. Mabuse der Spieler&quot; (&quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot;) and the death of Lang&#x27;s first wife, the couple married in 1922. They worked on a script that would reflect their pride in their German heritage, &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; (1924), and enhance von Harbou&#x27;s reputation as a writer for the screen. She became known for her unique habit of wearing the same dress throughout filming, even as she cooked hot meals for the crew during late nights. Visitors remembered Harbou taking charge of all the domestic and social responsibilities when visiting the couple&#x27;s apartment. During this time of poverty in 1920s Germany, Harbou became active in acquiring food for her film crew, as one friend recalled, &quot;She was even able to talk the UFA into carrying the costs so the crew could get their meals for free ... she stood there on the rough floor of that drafty shed for hours and didn&#x27;t mind peeling potatoes or cleaning vegetables with the other women. Such was the spirit of sacrifice.&quot;

von Harbou often developed her screenplays into full-length novels, with their publication scheduled to coincide with the release of the film, though this was not the case with &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). von Harbou was a central player in producing &quot;Metropolis&quot;, and this epic became significant. Besides writing the novel and the screenplay, and developing the distinct moral ending of &quot;Metropolis&quot;, she discovered Gustav Fröhlich, who played the lead role of Freder Fredersen.

Her next major collaboration with Lang was &quot;M&quot; (1931), a film about a child murderer. It was written with exquisite attention to accuracy. Lang and von Harbou had been enthralled with news coverage of Peter Kürten, known as the Monster of Düsseldorf, during the late 1920s. She used newspaper articles in developing the script and &quot;maintained regular contact with the police headquarters on Alexanderplatz and was permitted access to the communications and secret publications of Berlin&#x27;s force&quot;. Recalling the script, von Harbou&#x27;s secretary Hilde Guttmann later said, &quot;I saw many other film manuscripts, but never one which could compare with the manuscript for &quot;M&quot;. Two typewriter ribbons were stuck together to give us three colors: one black and red, and the other blue. The camera work and the action were typed in black, the dialogue blue, and the sound, where synchronized, was typed in red&quot;. Harbou received no credit as the script writer for &quot;M&quot;.

She was also involved in politics, joining the campaign against Germany&#x27;s paragraph 218, which made abortion a crime. At a mass rally in 1931, she said:
===Divorce===
Shortly after von Harbou married Lang, he developed the habit of openly pursuing younger women, but they nevertheless presented themselves as a happy couple with a contented home that would have seemed like a small museum of exotic art for the common citizen. Then, during the production of &quot;Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse&quot;, Lang discovered von Harbou in bed with Ayi Tendulkar, an Indian journalist and student 17 years younger than her.

After Lang and von Harbou&#x27;s divorce became final on 20 April 1933, the couple slowly lost contact with each other. Shortly after the divorce, von Harbou and Ayi Tendulkar contracted a secret marriage, because the Nazi state did not permit someone of her public stature to marry a dark-skinned Indian.

==Under Nazi rule==
With Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933, the German film industry began to be used for propaganda purposes. Von Harbou was loyal to the new regime. Around 1934, a year after the Nazi Party came to power, on her own initiative she wrote and directed two films, &quot;Elisabeth und der Narr&quot; and &quot;Hanneles Himmelfahrt&quot;. However, she did not find the experience of directing satisfactory and remained a prolific screenwriter during this time. &quot;Under a regime where every film was a &#x27;state film,&#x27; Thea von Harbou amassed writing credits on some twenty-six films, while giving uncredited assistance on countless others-including a handful with an indisputable National Socialist worldview&quot;.

When war broke out in 1939, her husband was forced to leave Germany, and their marriage ended. With von Harbou&#x27;s blessing, he courted and later married an Indian woman, who would visit her after the war (in 1953).

==After World War II==
From July to October 1945, Thea von Harbou was held in Staumühle, a British prison camp. Though many have asserted she had significant Nazi sympathies, von Harbou claimed she only joined the Nazi Party to help Indian immigrants in Germany, like her husband. Lang&#x27;s biographer, Patrick McGilligan, wrote: &quot;Her direct work on behalf of the government consisted, she claimed, entirely of volunteer welding, making hearing aids, and emergency medical care. In fact, she received a medal of merit for saving people in two air raids.&quot; In prison, she directed a performance of &quot;Faust&quot; and when released she worked as a Trümmerfrau (rubble woman) in 1945 and 1946.

==Death==
Toward the end of von Harbou&#x27;s life, pain from high blood pressure, migraines, and neuralgia weakened her, although she continued to write or dictate from her bed. After attending a showing of &quot;Der müde Tod&quot; (&quot;Destiny&quot;, 1921)
as a guest of honor in June 1954, she fell and suffered serious internal injuries in her hip. On 1 July 1954, five days later, she died in hospital at the age of sixty-five.

Several years after her death, Lang directed the film &quot;The Indian Tomb&quot; (1959), based upon one of von Harbou&#x27;s novels.

<doc id="505241" wikidata="Q2466197" url="?curid=505241" title="Zagora, Greece">
<text>Zagora () is a village and a former municipality on the Pelion peninsula in Magnesia, Thessaly, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Zagora-Mouresi, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 96.101 km2.

Zagora is an important commercial and touristic center of Pilion with a rich history and cultural traditions. Beyond Zagora, to the north, we find the Palaeolithic settlement of Pouri, and, to the east, the famous seaside resort of Chorefto. The village has many fine examples of architecture typical of Pilion, including its churches and several notable &quot;archontika&quot; (mansions). Zagora is composed of four districts that correspond to its four main churches: Agios Georgios, Agia Kyriaki, Agia Paraskevi (or Perachora) and Metamorphosis (or Sotira).

==Location==
Zagora is located north of Volos and west of Chorefto and is connected to the former by Greek National Road 34.

==History==
From findings of the area (Greek ruins, coins of the Pagas, etc.) it seems that it has been inhabited since the Homeric era. First mentions of the settlement under its current name come from the 13th century. In the 14th century Magnesia came under the control of the Republic of Venice and the Catalans.

The Venetian and Catalonian connections proved to be fruitful for the Zagorians. A large fleet was constructed in Zagora&#x27;s port, Chorefto, and extensive trade of silk begun. The Zagorian galleys reached as far as West Africa, Brazil and Scandinavia.

During the Ottoman occupation, the area was given privileges during the reign of Sultan Mehmet IV, the most important of which was that Turks should not live permanently in the area. Agriculture and trade flourished, while local handicrafts of woolen fabrics and silk flourished until the middle of the 19th century. Wealthy Zagorian merchants (like the ancestors of modern merchant Angelo Di Stamo) settled in many cities abroad. Those who remained in the village maintained branches and representatives in important trade centers of the time (in Moldavia, Russia, etc.). The financial strength and the constant communication with the outside created the ground for the intellectual development and prosperity of Zagora.

In the middle of the 1850s (during 1853 or 1855) the Kassavetio Girls&#x27; School started operating, which was the first girls&#x27; school founded in Ottoman Thessaly. Later, in the revolution of Pelion in January 1878 (part of the wider Greek revolutions in the Ottoman territory), Zagora was the seat of the revolutionary government of the insurgent regions whose president was elected Jerome Kassavetis. Although that revolution was suppressed, on the initiative of England, it resulted in the concession of Thessaly to Greece by the Treaty of Berlin of 1878.

In 1938, the road connecting Zagora to Volos was completed. During the Axis Occupation of Greece, in January 1943, the Italian commander of Volos, Luigi Giala, ordered the bombing of Zagora from Horefto after an Italian sergeant was killed in a clash with guerrillas near Zagora. Italian forces then raided the town, looting it, leading to mass arrests and sporadic killings. Later some of the prisoners were executed, while, in mid-February of the same year, the inhabitants were forced to evacuate Zagora, to which they returned after about a month.

==Etymology==
There are two different versions of the origin of village&#x27;s current name. In one version, the name is derived from the Greek term for &quot;animal market&quot; (); there was a large annual market where animals from as far as Mongolia and Madagascar were bought and sold. In other version, &quot;Zagora&quot; comes from the Slavic word &quot;Zagora&quot; meaning behind the mountain, and, perhaps for this reason, the villages on the eastern side of Pelion were once called the &quot;villages of Zagora&quot;.

==Places of interest==
The Public Historic Library of Zagora was founded in 1762 and is known for its collection of about 3,500 old and rare books. The library&#x27;s contemporary collection contains over 10,000 books and magazines. Key early contributors to the library were John Prigos (1725 - 1789), the library&#x27;s founder, and the Patriarch Callinicus IV. The library is located immediately to the north of Zagora&#x27;s Agios Giorgios Church, near the village&#x27;s main plateia, or square.

The school of Rigas Feraios or Hellenic Museum as it is known, is the oldest school on Pelion. Rigas Feraios was among its students.

Zagora has four main Greek Orthodox churches, each constructed in a style typical of Pilion:
* Agios Georgios (built 1765)
* Agia Kyriaki (built 1740)
* Agia Paraskevi (or Perachora ) (built 1803)
* Metamorphosis (or Sotira) (built after the original church burned down in 1887)

Other notable churches in Zagora are Agios Triantaphyllos and Panageia.

==Education and commercial activity==

Zagora has a primary and a secondary school, five churches, six coffee houses, two bakeries, two banks, a post office, and seven squares.

Zagora is home to one of the oldest agricultural cooperatives in Greece. The Agricultural Cooperative of Zagora-Pilio, founded October 27, 1916 as the &quot;Zagora Agricultural Products Sales Cooperative&quot; originally had potatoes and hazelnuts as its main products. In the 1960s local farmers began to cultivate the &quot;Starking Delicious&quot; apple variety, which proved ideal for the area&#x27;s climate and soil conditions. By the 1980s the Agricultural Cooperative was marketing 98% of local production. In 1985, the Agricultural Cooperative began to sticker its fruit with a trademarked &quot;Zagorin&quot; sticker to develop brand awareness. In 1996, the European Union designated &quot;Zagorin&quot; as a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) for Zagorin apples. The Agricultural Cooperative currently markets the following additional apple varieties: Fuji, Fyriki of Pilion, Golden Delicious, Reinette du Canada and Royal Gala. The Cooperative also makes and sells petimezi (molasses) from apples. In addition to apples, the Agricultural Cooperative sells other fruits and nuts such as pears, cherries, kiwis and chestnuts.

The Women&#x27;s Agrotourism Cooperative of Zagora is the oldest women&#x27;s cooperative in Magnesia and was founded in 1993 by 50 women who wished to utilize their traditional skills in Greece&#x27;s tourism sector. The cooperative operates a cafe and store on the Agios Giorgios Plateia, Zagora&#x27;s main square and sells and serves coffee, teas, soft drinks and alcoholic beverages with their homemade traditional pastries, jams, liqueurs, and spoon sweets. To assure quality and increase productivity the Women&#x27;s Cooperative now produces most of its products in a workshop that is across the stone pathway from the cafe and store. Near the workshop, the Women&#x27;s Coopertive also operates a five-room inn in a traditional refurbished, listed &quot;archontikon&quot; (mansion) that was built in 1906.

<text>GamesMaster was a British television programme which originally aired on Channel 4 from 1992 to 1998. In 2021, it returned for a new series on YouTube and E4. It was the first UK television programme dedicated to video games.

Dominik Diamond was the host for six of the original seven series while astronomer Sir Patrick Moore featured as the GamesMaster. He was replaced in 2021 with Sir Trevor McDonald. The show&#x27;s format consists of a mixture of game reviews, small &quot;features&quot;, tips and challenges. Challenges form the biggest section of the show and generally consist of &quot;average&quot; players and celebrities, often competing against each other for the coveted Golden Joystick.

==Origins==
&quot;GamesMaster&quot; began when Jane Hewland, formerly of London Weekend Television, who had set up her own production company Hewland International, took an interest in her son&#x27;s love of video games. She put together a pitch for a programme that would translate the excitement of games playing into watchable television. After some rejection, Hewland put together a video interviewing her son&#x27;s friends about why they loved video games. It was Channel 4 that became interested in the concept and approved the production, though they only provided an initial budget of £10,000 per episode for a 10 episode first season.

==Format and hosts==
Although it featured game reviews, most of the programme was about challenges where game players would compete as sole competitors and complete a level on a video game or against one another, in which this would either be playing individually against each other, or in a head-to-head contest. Contestants who were successful at their challenges were rewarded with the coveted &quot;&quot;GamesMaster&quot; Golden Joystick&quot; trophy. Dominik Diamond usually presented the programme with Sir Patrick Moore appearing in pre-recorded inserts as the &#x27;Games Master&#x27;. During these challenges, Dominik was joined by a host of commentators. These included Derrick Lynch, Kirk Ewing, Julian Rignall, Rik Henderson, Dave Perry, Tim Boone and Neil West amongst others.

For the third series, Dexter Fletcher became the main presenter; this change was criticised by fans, who saw the new host as over-the-top, and too &#x27;in-your-face&#x27;. To balance this, the production company dropped all other co-presenters and gave UK games champion Dave Perry a regular co-presenter slot on every episode. Fletcher was better known at the time for having played an American character called &quot;Spike&quot; in the ITV drama series &quot;Press Gang&quot;.

==Review segments==
From the very first episode, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; included reviews of forthcoming titles. In an attempt to give the programme some authority and get the gaming press on their side, as well as eliminate the need for extra staff to review games, the reviews featured a host of magazines journalists from the publishing house EMAP. This meant the programme could pool the collective opinions of magazines like &quot;Mean Machines&quot;, &quot;C&amp;VG&quot; and &quot;ACE&quot;.

However, by series 5, it was decided that the reviews would be better presented by two of the programme&#x27;s co-commentators, namely Rik Henderson and Dave Perry. It brought a much-needed stability to the format and some interesting banter between the reviewers. Series 6 also featured Rik, who was now joined by Ed Lomas, while series 7, due to time constraints and Dave Perry having resigned from the programme&#x27;s cast (after complaining on-air about being &quot;set up&quot; during a &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; challenge), employed two of its own research staff to present the slot, including Richard Pitt.

==Stage set==
Each series was set in a different location, with an in-universe narrative given for the changes of set, such as series 2 being set on an oil rig, which is evacuated at end of series 2 due to an explosion. The opening to series 3 has Dexter Fletcher announcing that the previous host (who had left the programme) had not survived. Diamond would later return in series 4 onwards which was set in Hell and then in Heaven for series 5. In the opening credits to series 6 Diamond was portrayed as falling from Heaven. The series 7 titles were a dream sequence in which Diamond travelled to the series&#x27; island setting.

Every series following Series 2 had the original series&#x27; closing moments portrayed in the series itself as the previous &quot;set&quot; being deconstructed in some manner. In the final series, the set was literally dismantled and the studio closed down over Diamond&#x27;s final words.

==Relationship with the games industry==
Prior to &quot;GamesMaster&quot; appearing, games companies had very few TV programmes on which to have their titles featured. UK broadcasters had shown sporadic interest in the scene, normally confining coverage to segments within Saturday morning children&#x27;s programming. From time to time, news programmes would report on one of the very successful British games studios, but in contrast to programming involving films and music videos, there was no regular showcase for video games.

&quot;GamesMaster&quot; was first broadcast in 1992, during the fourth (16-bit) console generation - after the launch of the Mega Drive, but before the SNES. Sega&#x27;s success in the early 90s (with both the Master System and Mega Drive, as well as the huge hit game Sonic the Hedgehog) helped cause a video game console boom in 1991, bringing gaming into mainstream UK culture, which would only increase following the arrival of consoles with more advanced graphics capabilities, such as those found on the PlayStation. That &quot;GamesMaster&quot; regularly drew in audiences in the millions proved that there was a huge and so far untapped audience.

Despite competition with specialist gaming magazines, the programme managed to secure several exclusives over the series, showing games that were months or even years away from being finished. Because &quot;GamesMaster&quot; was largely a challenge-based programme, games studios could, for example, present a single level to be used for these competitive segments. &quot;Blast Corps&quot; is one example of a game that was demonstrated long before it, or even the Nintendo 64 that it played on, were released.

Occasionally, games studios made levels specifically for use on one of the challenges. Shiny Entertainment were one such studio when they put together a special level of &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;. Though this worked out well for both game studio and the programme, the experience was somewhat soured when this code ended up being leaked on the Internet. It is believed that the only way for this to have happened is that one of the staff on the programme must have had links with online ROM crackers. It led to a great deal of embarrassment and likely upset the trust that existed between the producer, Shiny Entertainment and their publisher, Virgin Interactive.

==Gamesmaster sponsorship==

*&quot;Meta Quest 2&quot; (21 November 2021 – present) (Series 8)

==Demise==
Prior to &quot;GamesMaster&quot; leaving UK television, there had been a crisis of confidence in games television over at rival channel ITV. Their children&#x27;s department had commissioned another video games programme &quot;T.I.G.S.&quot; to accompany &quot;Bad Influence!&quot;. Then, one series later, they pulled the plug on both programmes, deciding that there was no demand for games coverage on their channel.

&quot;GamesMaster&quot; was not affected and continued with success. In 1998, towards the end of production for the 7th series, the programme was looking set to be re-commissioned; viewing figures were still strong, and the programme was finding a new audience, benefiting from the emerging PlayStation culture with the success of Sony&#x27;s console bringing gaming into the mainstream. The production was also more oriented towards actual games players than the first few series, which had been decidedly light in feature content, and no longer poked fun at &#x27;nerds&#x27; and &#x27;geeks&#x27;, as it was young adults and not children and teenagers who appeared on the programme; indeed, they and the publicity-seeking celebrities were now the subject of jokes.

It is believed that Dominik Diamond, along with the programme&#x27;s producers, wanted to make a more adult programme that would air in a late night, more mainstream time slot. (Series 8 was going to be set on a pirate ship with buxom wenches as the Golden Joystick assistants.) There was also talk of a spin-off programme being made that would seek to emulate the US talk shows of the time. Whether this would have meant a programme that focused far less on games is unknown. No confirmation exists that any pilots of this concept were ever made; Channel 4 did not see the potential of a gaming programme for an older, adult audience.

However, changes in senior staff at Channel 4 were responsible for taking the programme off the air. The new head of Channel 4 was Michael Jackson who had worked at LWT at the same time as Jane Hewland; the two never saw eye-to-eye. Alternatively, having been the head of BBC Two, Jackson may have wanted less entertainment programming on Channel 4.

The first series of the programme was repeated on Challenge in 2003, but no further episodes have been shown. Challenge thought the programme was &quot;too dated&quot; and &quot;the games being played wouldn&#x27;t stand up today&quot;.

==Broadcasting spin-offs==
Several gaming shows were commissioned by Sky 1 in 1993 from Hewland International (one of which was &quot;Games World&quot;). Due to this close relationship with BSkyB, Hewland International were even successful in convincing them to launch a whole new channel dedicated to gaming, computers, the internet and technology. The Computer Channel launched in 1996 for only BSkyB subscribers, appearing for just two hours every night. Originally, the only gaming show was &quot;Game Over&quot;, made by some of the same production team as &quot;Gamesmaster&quot; and &quot;Games World&quot;. When The Computer Channel was relaunched as .tv in 1998, other shows began to start covering the gaming scene. These included &quot;Gear&quot;, &quot;Roadtest&quot;, &quot;ExMachina&quot; and also &quot;Games Republic&quot;.

The latter show was closest in style and tone to &quot;Gamesmaster&quot;, featured a themed studio set, studio challenges and the irreverent presenters Trevor and Simon. Though the show did not include any features or VT content, as it was a question based game show based on video games, it was produced by &quot;Gamesmaster&quot; and &quot;When Games Attack&quot; producer Johnny Ffinch. The series unfortunately came under fire from fans after several questions asked in the show had incorrect answers, infuriating several contestants over the series. (For example, poorly researched questions about the Dreamcast&#x27;s online capabilities, and characters from &quot;Tekken&quot;).

Dominik Diamond returned to games television first as an interviewee in the 1999 documentary &quot;Games Wars&quot;, in which he commented that boys getting turned on by Lara Croft was tragic and &quot;desperately sad&quot;. He then returned to presenting in 2004 with a show on Bravo, called &quot;When Games Attack&quot;. This programme was largely feature-based and contained plenty of Dominik&#x27;s trademark humour. Prior to its broadcast, Dominik featured in a sizable &quot;Edge&quot; interview, with his longtime producer Johnny Finch. Both of them were quite vocal in stating their contempt for other shows about video games that were doing a bad job.

Though it did also feature minor celebrity challenges (mainly football players and glamour models), there were never any head-to-head competitions. To date, Bravo has yet to show a second series. However, in November 2007, a repeat of the only series to date was aired.

In 1999, the BBC filmed two pilot episodes of a new TV show franchise dedicated to video games titled &quot;Bleeding Thumbs&quot; - with Gamesmaster&#x27;s Rik Henderson as assistant producer and initial commentator. The series would have run between 1999 and 2000 alternating with the hugely successful &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, hoping to emulate the success &quot;GamesMaster&quot; achieved in the process. Two pilots were filmed and were hosted by Dermot O&#x27;Leary and Kate Thornton, and then Terry Alderton accompanying Thornton, the commissioning editor decommissioned the show claiming that &quot;People want to play games, not watch them&quot;.

&quot;GamesMaster&quot; was also the first UK show to feature the sport of robot fighting in a news item, which at the time was on Local Public-access television in the US. Hewland International worked for several years to translate the sport into something for UK viewers. Though they never succeeded, another production company, Mentorn, were able to get their show concept &quot;Robot Wars&quot; picked up by BBC Two.

==Revival==
In February 2021, Channel 4 announced that they were looking for a brand partner for a potential reboot of &quot;GamesMaster&quot;. According to the description of the format, celebrities will &quot;undergo challenges, races and fights in virtual battle across all genres of gaming under the watchful eye of the all-knowing GamesMaster&quot;. On 29 September 2021, Frankie Ward, Robert Florence, and Ty Logan were announced as the new hosts. Episodes will first appear on E4&#x27;s YouTube channel before broadcast on the E4 television channel. On 25 October 2021 it was announced that Sir Trevor McDonald would be the new GamesMaster. The series was filmed at Crossness Pumping Station in Abbey Wood, London from 5 to 6 October 2021.

On 10 November 2022, Channel 4 announced that &quot;GamesMaster&quot; would continue to another series after being successful in social platforms. The next series was announced to be broadcast on social media in 2023 though as of 2025, no broadcast had taken place.

==Magazine==

In January 1993, Future Publishing began a tie-in magazine, also called GamesMaster. In the May issue of 2010, Editor-in-chief Robin Alway announced that Future Publishing were &#x27;looking into&#x27; reintroducing the programme to British television, and promised that he would keep the readers of the magazine informed of any future details. The magazine ceased publishing in November 2018, having outlasted the original TV series by more than twenty years.

<doc id="505246" wikidata="Q33427" url="?curid=505246" title="Korandje language">
<text>Korandje (Korandje: &quot;kwạṛa n dzyəy&quot;; ) is a Northern Songhay language which is by far the most northerly of the Songhay languages. It is spoken around the Algerian oasis of Tabelbala by about 3,000 people; its name literally means &quot;village&#x27;s language&quot;. While retaining a basically Songhay structure, it is extremely heavily influenced by Berber and Arabic; about 20% of the 100-word Swadesh list of basic vocabulary consists of loanwords from Arabic or Berber, and the proportion of the lexicon as a whole is considerably higher.

The only published studies of Korandje based on first-hand data are Cancel (1908), a 45-page article by a French lieutenant covering basic grammar and vocabulary and a couple of sample texts; Champault (1969), an anthropological study containing some incidental linguistically relevant materials such as sentences and rhymes; Tilmatine (1991, 1996), an article (published in German, then reworked in French) revisiting Cancel and Champault and adding about a page of new data recorded by the author; and Souag (2010a, 2010b), the former arguing the case for Western Berber loans in the lexicon, the latter studying the effect of contact with Berber and Arabic on its grammar.

==Phonology==

No complete phonological study of Korandje, systematically justified by minimal pairs, has yet been made. According to Souag (2010), the vowel system consists of lax ə, ŭ [], ə̣̣ [] and tense a [], i, u, ạ [], ụ [], while the consonant system is as follows:

Items in brackets are not normally used by older speakers. A bilabial click is attested in one baby-talk word.

An earlier proposal by Nicolaï (1981), based on a very limited corpus of recordings provided by Champault, suggested a smaller phoneme inventory:

alongside pharyngealised consonants &quot;ṭ ḍ ṣ ẓ ṇ ḥ&quot; as well as &quot;x q&quot;, found mainly in loanwords, and a six-vowel system: &quot;a, i, u, e, o&quot;, and &quot;ə&quot; (schwa).

==Grammar==

===Pronouns===

The pronouns are: &quot;aγəy&quot;, I; &quot;ni&quot;, you; &quot;ana&quot;, he/she/it; &quot;yayu&quot;, we; &quot;ndzyu&quot;, you (plural); &quot;ini&quot;, they. Possessive forms are &quot;ʕan&quot;, my; &quot;nən&quot;, your; &quot;an&quot;, his/her/its; &quot;yan&quot;, our; &quot;ndzən&quot;, your (pl.); &quot;in&quot;, their. Subject agreement prefixes on the verb are &quot;ʕa-&quot; I; &quot;n-&quot;, you; &quot;a-&quot;, he/she/it; &quot;ya-&quot;, we; &quot;ndz-&quot;, you (plural); &quot;i-&quot;, they.

===Verbs===

The infinitive and singular imperative are both the stem (e.g. &quot;kani&quot; &quot;sleep&quot;); the plural imperative takes a prefix &quot;wə-&quot; (&quot;wə-kkani&quot; &quot;sleep! (pl.)&quot;). Cancel describes the conjugations as follows (also for &quot;xani&quot;):

According to Tilmatine, verbs are negated by surrounding them with &quot;`as ... hé/hi&quot;, e.g. &quot;ni `as ba enγa hé&quot; &gt; &quot;n`esbanγa hé&quot; &quot;do not eat!&quot;. &quot;No&quot; is &quot;hoho&quot; or &quot;ho&quot;: &quot;n&#x27;d&#x27;xani bînu, willa ho?&quot; &quot;did you sleep yesterday, or not?&quot;.

===Nouns===

The most productive plural marker is the clitic &quot;=yu&quot;:

This marker comes at the end of the &quot;core noun phrase&quot;, the unit consisting of noun+numeral+adjective+demonstrative:

Some Berber loans retain versions of their original plurals, usually with the circumfix &quot;(ts)i-...-ən&quot;,

While the morphemes involved are clearly of Berber origin, the details of this system differ from any one attested Berber language, and this plural is extended to at least one item of Songhay origin, &quot;tsạṛə̣w&quot; &quot;spoon&quot; &gt; &quot;tsiṛạwən&quot;. Some Arabic loans similarly retain Arabic plurals.

The possessive is expressed by the particle &quot;n&quot;, with the possessor preceding the possessed:

==Numbers==

The only non-Arabic numbers in normal use are &quot;a-ffu&quot; &quot;one&quot;, &quot;inka&quot; &quot;two&quot;, and &quot;inẓa&quot; &quot;three&quot;. There also exist &quot;cryptic&quot; (argot) and children&#x27;s counting systems. The syntax of numerals in the noun phrases is complicated.

<doc id="505253" wikidata="Q2534367" url="?curid=505253" title="List of regular polytopes">
<text>This article lists the regular polytopes in Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic spaces.

==Overview==
This table shows a summary of regular polytope counts by rank.


There are no Euclidean regular star tessellations in any number of dimensions.

==1-polytopes==

There is only one polytope of rank 1 (1-polytope), the closed line segment bounded by its two endpoints. Every realization of this 1-polytope is regular. It has the Schläfli symbol { }, or a Coxeter diagram with a single ringed node, . Norman Johnson calls it a &quot;dion&quot; and gives it the Schläfli symbol { }.

Although trivial as a polytope, it appears as the edges of polygons and other higher dimensional polytopes. It is used in the definition of uniform prisms like Schläfli symbol { }×{p}, or Coxeter diagram as a Cartesian product of a line segment and a regular polygon.

==2-polytopes (polygons)==

The polytopes of rank 2 (2-polytopes) are called polygons. Regular polygons are equilateral and cyclic. A -gonal regular polygon is represented by Schläfli symbol {p}.

Many sources only consider convex polygons, but star polygons, like the pentagram, when considered, can also be regular. They use the same vertices as the convex forms, but connect in an alternate connectivity which passes around the circle more than once to be completed.

===Convex===

The Schläfli symbol {p} represents a regular -gon.

====Spherical====

The regular digon {2} can be considered to be a degenerate regular polygon. It can be realized non-degenerately in some non-Euclidean spaces, such as on the surface of a sphere or torus. For example, digon can be realised non-degenerately as a spherical lune. A monogon {1} could also be realised on the sphere as a single point with a great circle through it. However, a monogon is not a valid abstract polytope because its single edge is incident to only one vertex rather than two.

===Stars===
There exist infinitely many regular star polytopes in two dimensions, whose Schläfli symbols consist of rational numbers . They are called star polygons and share the same vertex arrangements of the convex regular polygons.

In general, for any natural number , there are regular -pointed stars with Schläfli symbols for all such that (strictly speaking ) and and are coprime (as such, all stellations of a polygon with a prime number of sides will be regular stars). Symbols where and are not coprime may be used to represent compound polygons.

Star polygons that can only exist as spherical tilings, similarly to the monogon and digon, may exist (for example: {3/2}, {5/3}, {5/4}, {7/4}, {9/5}), however these have not been studied in detail.

There also exist failed star polygons, such as the &quot;piangle&quot;, which do not cover the surface of a circle finitely many times.

===Skew polygons ===
In addition to the planar regular polygons there are infinitely many regular skew polygons. Skew polygons can be created via the blending operation.

The blend of two polygons and , written , can be constructed as follows:
# take the cartesian product of their vertices .
# add edges where is an edge of and is an edge of .
# select an arbitrary connected component of the result.
Alternatively, the blend is the polygon where and are the generating mirrors of and placed in orthogonal subspaces.
The blending operation is commutative, associative and idempotent.

Every regular skew polygon can be expressed as the blend of a unique set of planar polygons. If and share no factors then .

====In 3 space====
The regular finite polygons in 3 dimensions are exactly the blends of the planar polygons (dimension 2) with the digon (dimension 1). They have vertices corresponding to a prism ( where is odd) or an antiprism ( where is even). All polygons in 3 space have an even number of vertices and edges.

Several of these appear as the Petrie polygons of regular polyhedra.

====In 4 space====
The regular finite polygons in 4 dimensions are exactly the polygons formed as a blend of two distinct planar polygons. They have vertices lying on a Clifford torus and related by a Clifford displacement. Unlike 3-dimensional polygons, skew polygons on double rotations can include an odd-number of sides.

==3-polytopes (polyhedra)==

Polytopes of rank 3 are called polyhedra:

A regular polyhedron with Schläfli symbol , Coxeter diagrams , has a regular face type , and regular vertex figure .

A vertex figure (of a polyhedron) is a polygon, seen by connecting those vertices which are one edge away from a given vertex. For regular polyhedra, this vertex figure is always a regular (and planar) polygon.

Existence of a regular polyhedron is constrained by an inequality, related to the vertex figure&#x27;s angle defect:
formula_1

By enumerating the permutations, we find five convex forms, four star forms and three plane tilings, all with polygons and limited to: {3}, {4}, {5}, {5/2}, and {6}.

Beyond Euclidean space, there is an infinite set of regular hyperbolic tilings.

===Convex===
The five convex regular polyhedra are called the Platonic solids. The vertex figure is given with each vertex count. All these polyhedra have an Euler characteristic (χ) of 2.

====Spherical====

In spherical geometry, regular spherical polyhedra (tilings of the sphere) exist that would otherwise be degenerate as polytopes. These are the hosohedra {2,n} and their dual dihedra {n,2}. Coxeter calls these cases &quot;improper&quot; tessellations.

The first few cases (n from 2 to 6) are listed below.

Star-dihedra and hosohedra and also exist for any star polygon .

===Stars===
The regular star polyhedra are called the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra and there are four of them, based on the vertex arrangements of the dodecahedron {5,3} and icosahedron {3,5}:

As spherical tilings, these star forms overlap the sphere multiple times, called its &quot;density&quot;, being 3 or 7 for these forms. The tiling images show a single spherical polygon face in yellow.
There are infinitely many failed star polyhedra. These are also spherical tilings with star polygons in their Schläfli symbols, but they do not cover a sphere finitely many times. Some examples are {5/2,4}, {5/2,9}, {7/2,3}, {5/2,5/2}, {7/2,7/3}, {4,5/2}, and {3,7/3}.

=== Skew polyhedra ===

Regular skew polyhedra are generalizations to the set of regular polyhedron which include the possibility of nonplanar vertex figures.

For 4-dimensional skew polyhedra, Coxeter offered a modified Schläfli symbol {l,m|n} for these figures, with {l,m} implying the vertex figure, &quot;m&quot; l-gons around a vertex, and -gonal holes. Their vertex figures are skew polygons, zig-zagging between two planes.

The regular skew polyhedra, represented by {l,m|n}, follow this equation:

formula_2

Four of them can be seen in 4-dimensions as a subset of faces of four regular 4-polytopes, sharing the same vertex arrangement and edge arrangement:

==4-polytopes==

Regular 4-polytopes with Schläfli symbol formula_3 have cells of type formula_4, faces of type formula_5, edge figures
formula_6, and vertex figures formula_7.
* A vertex figure (of a 4-polytope) is a polyhedron, seen by the arrangement of neighboring vertices around a given vertex. For regular 4-polytopes, this vertex figure is a regular polyhedron.
* An edge figure is a polygon, seen by the arrangement of faces around an edge. For regular 4-polytopes, this edge figure will always be a regular polygon.

The existence of a regular 4-polytope formula_3 is constrained by the existence of the regular polyhedra formula_9. A suggested name for 4-polytopes is &quot;polychoron&quot;.

Each will exist in a space dependent upon this expression:
: formula_10
:: formula_11 : Hyperspherical 3-space honeycomb or 4-polytope
:: formula_12 : Euclidean 3-space honeycomb
:: formula_13 : Hyperbolic 3-space honeycomb

These constraints allow for 21 forms: 6 are convex, 10 are nonconvex, &quot;one&quot; is a Euclidean 3-space honeycomb, and 4 are hyperbolic honeycombs.

The Euler characteristic formula_14 for convex 4-polytopes is zero:
formula_15

===Convex===

The 6 convex regular 4-polytopes are shown in the table below. All these 4-polytopes have an Euler characteristic (χ) of 0.

====Spherical====

Di-4-topes and hoso-4-topes exist as regular tessellations of the 3-sphere.

Regular di-4-topes (2 facets) include: {3,3,2}, {3,4,2}, {4,3,2}, {5,3,2}, {3,5,2}, {p,2,2}, and their hoso-4-tope duals (2 vertices): {2,3,3}, {2,4,3}, {2,3,4}, {2,3,5}, {2,5,3}, {2,2,&quot;p&quot;}. 4-polytopes of the form {2,&quot;p&quot;,2} are the same as {2,2,&quot;p&quot;}. There are also the cases {&quot;p&quot;,2,&quot;q&quot;} which have dihedral cells and hosohedral vertex figures.

===Stars===
There are ten regular star 4-polytopes, which are called the Schläfli–Hess 4-polytopes. Their vertices are based on the convex 120-cell &quot;{5,3,3}&quot; and 600-cell &quot;{3,3,5}&quot;.

Ludwig Schläfli found four of them and skipped the last six because he would not allow forms that failed the Euler characteristic on cells or vertex figures (for zero-hole tori: F+V−E=2). Edmund Hess (1843–1903) completed the full list of ten in his German book &quot;Einleitung in die Lehre von der Kugelteilung mit besonderer Berücksichtigung ihrer Anwendung auf die Theorie der Gleichflächigen und der gleicheckigen Polyeder&quot; (1883).

There are 4 unique edge arrangements and 7 unique face arrangements from these 10 regular star 4-polytopes, shown as orthogonal projections:
There are 4 &quot;failed&quot; potential regular star 4-polytopes permutations: {3,5/2,3}, {4,3,5/2}, {5/2,3,4}, {5/2,3,5/2}. Their cells and vertex figures exist, but they do not cover a hypersphere with a finite number of repetitions.

===Skew 4-polytopes===

In addition to the 16 planar 4-polytopes above there are 18 finite skew polytopes. One of these is obtained as the Petrial of the tesseract, and the other 17 can be formed by applying the kappa operation to the planar polytopes and the Petrial of the tesseract.

==Ranks 5 and higher==
5-polytopes can be given the symbol formula_16 where formula_3 is the 4-face type, formula_4 is the cell type, formula_5 is the face type, and formula_20 is the face figure, formula_21 is the edge figure, and formula_22 is the vertex figure.

: A vertex figure (of a 5-polytope) is a 4-polytope, seen by the arrangement of neighboring vertices to each vertex.
: An edge figure (of a 5-polytope) is a polyhedron, seen by the arrangement of faces around each edge.
: A face figure (of a 5-polytope) is a polygon, seen by the arrangement of cells around each face.

A regular 5-polytope formula_16 exists only if formula_3 and formula_22 are regular 4-polytopes.

The space it fits in is based on the expression:
: formula_26
:: formula_27 : Spherical 4-space tessellation or 5-space polytope
:: formula_28 : Euclidean 4-space tessellation
:: formula_29 : hyperbolic 4-space tessellation

Enumeration of these constraints produce 3 convex polytopes, no star polytopes, 3 tessellations of Euclidean 4-space, and &quot;5&quot; tessellations of paracompact hyperbolic 4-space. The only non-convex regular polytopes for ranks 5 and higher are skews.

===Convex===
In dimensions 5 and higher, there are only three kinds of convex regular polytopes.

There are also improper cases where some numbers in the Schläfli symbol are 2. For example, {p,q,r...2} is an improper regular spherical polytope whenever {p,q,r...} is a regular spherical polytope, and {2...p,q,r} is an improper regular spherical polytope whenever {...p,q,r} is a regular spherical polytope. Such polytopes may also be used as facets, yielding forms such as {p,q...2...y,z}.

====5 dimensions====


====6 dimensions====


====7 dimensions====


====8 dimensions====


====9 dimensions====


====10 dimensions====


===Star polytopes===

There are no regular star polytopes of rank 5 or higher, with the exception of degenerate polytopes created by the star product of lower rank star polytopes. hosotopes and ditopes.

== Regular projective polytopes ==
A projective regular -polytope exists when an original regular -spherical tessellation, {p,q...}, is centrally symmetric. Such a polytope is named hemi-{p,q...}, and contain half as many elements. Coxeter gives a symbol {p,q...}/2, while McMullen writes {p,q...}h/2 with &quot;h&quot; as the coxeter number.

Even-sided regular polygons have hemi-&quot;2n&quot;-gon projective polygons, {2p}/2.

There are 4 regular projective polyhedra related to 4 of 5 Platonic solids.

The hemi-cube and hemi-octahedron generalize as hemi--cubes and hemi--orthoplexes to any rank.

=== Regular projective polyhedra===
=== Regular projective 4-polytopes===
5 of 6 convex regular 4-polytopes are centrally symmetric generating projective 4-polytopes. The 3 special cases are hemi-24-cell, hemi-600-cell, and hemi-120-cell.

===Regular projective 5-polytopes===
Only 2 of 3 regular spherical polytopes are centrally symmetric for ranks 5 or higher. The corresponding regular projective polytopes are the hemi versions of the regular hypercube and orthoplex. They are tabulated below for rank 5, for example:

==Apeirotopes==
An apeirotope or infinite polytope is a polytope which has infinitely many facets. An -apeirotope is an infinite -polytope: a 2-apeirotope or apeirogon is an infinite polygon, a 3-apeirotope or apeirohedron is an infinite polyhedron, etc.

There are two main geometric classes of apeirotope:
*Regular honeycombs in dimensions, which completely fill an -dimensional space.
*Regular skew apeirotopes, comprising an -dimensional manifold in a higher space.

===2-apeirotopes (apeirogons)===
The straight apeirogon is a regular tessellation of the line, subdividing it into infinitely many equal segments. It has infinitely many vertices and edges. Its Schläfli symbol is {∞}, and Coxeter diagram .

It exists as the limit of the -gon as tends to infinity, as follows:

Apeirogons in the hyperbolic plane, most notably the &quot;regular apeirogon&quot;, {∞}, can have a curvature just like finite polygons of the Euclidean plane, with the vertices circumscribed by horocycles or hypercycles rather than circles.

Regular apeirogons that are scaled to converge at infinity have the symbol {∞} and exist on horocycles, while more generally they can exist on hypercycles.

Above are two regular hyperbolic apeirogons in the Poincaré disk model, the right one shows perpendicular reflection lines of divergent fundamental domains, separated by length λ.

==== Skew apeirogons ====
A skew apeirogon in two dimensions forms a zig-zag line in the plane. If the zig-zag is even and symmetrical, then the apeirogon is regular.

Skew apeirogons can be constructed in any number of dimensions. In three dimensions, a regular skew apeirogon traces out a helical spiral and may be either left- or right-handed.

===3-apeirotopes (apeirohedra)===

====Euclidean tilings====

There are six regular tessellations of the plane: the three listed below, and their corresponding Petrials.
There are two improper regular tilings: {∞,2}, an apeirogonal dihedron, made from two apeirogons, each filling half the plane; and secondly, its dual, {2,∞}, an apeirogonal hosohedron, seen as an infinite set of parallel lines.

====Euclidean star-tilings====

There are no regular plane tilings of star polygons. There are many enumerations that fit in the plane (1/&quot;p&quot; + 1/&quot;q&quot; = 1/2), like {8/3,8}, {10/3,5}, {5/2,10}, {12/5,12}, etc., but none repeat periodically.

====Hyperbolic tilings====

Tessellations of hyperbolic 2-space are &quot;hyperbolic tilings&quot;. There are infinitely many regular tilings in H2. As stated above, every positive integer pair {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;} such that 1/&quot;p&quot; + 1/&quot;q&quot; &lt; 1/2 gives a hyperbolic tiling. In fact, for the general Schwarz triangle (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) the same holds true for 1/&quot;p&quot; + 1/&quot;q&quot; + 1/&quot;r&quot; &lt; 1.

There are a number of different ways to display the hyperbolic plane, including the Poincaré disc model which maps the plane into a circle, as shown below. It should be recognized that all of the polygon faces in the tilings below are equal-sized and only appear to get smaller near the edges due to the projection applied, very similar to the effect of a camera fisheye lens.

There are infinitely many flat regular 3-apeirotopes (apeirohedra) as regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane, of the form {p,q}, with p+q&lt;pq/2.
* {3,7}, {3,8}, {3,9} ... {3,∞}
* {4,5}, {4,6}, {4,7} ... {4,∞}
* {5,4}, {5,5}, {5,6} ... {5,∞}
* {6,4}, {6,5}, {6,6} ... {6,∞}
* {7,3}, {7,4}, {7,5} ... {7,∞}
* {8,3}, {8,4}, {8,5} ... {8,∞}
* {9,3}, {9,4}, {9,5} ... {9,∞}
* {∞,3}, {∞,4}, {∞,5} ... {∞,∞}

A sampling:
The tilings {p, ∞} have ideal vertices, on the &quot;edge&quot; of the Poincaré disc model. Their duals {∞, p} have ideal apeirogonal faces, meaning that they are inscribed in horocycles. One could go further (as is done in the table above) and find tilings with ultra-ideal vertices, outside the Poincaré disc, which are dual to tiles inscribed in hypercycles; in what is symbolised {p, iπ/λ} above, infinitely many tiles still fit around each ultra-ideal vertex. (Parallel lines in extended hyperbolic space meet at an ideal point; ultraparallel lines meet at an ultra-ideal point.)

====Hyperbolic star-tilings====
There are 2 infinite forms of hyperbolic tilings whose faces or vertex figures are star polygons: {&quot;m&quot;/2, &quot;m&quot;} and their duals {&quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot;/2} with &quot;m&quot; = 7, 9, 11, ... The {&quot;m&quot;/2, &quot;m&quot;} tilings are stellations of the {&quot;m&quot;, 3} tilings while the {&quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot;/2} dual tilings are facetings of the {3, &quot;m&quot;} tilings and greatenings of the {&quot;m&quot;, 3} tilings.

The patterns {&quot;m&quot;/2, &quot;m&quot;} and {&quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot;/2} continue for odd &quot;m&quot; &lt; 7 as polyhedra: when &quot;m&quot; = 5, we obtain the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron, and when &quot;m&quot; = 3, the case degenerates to a tetrahedron. The other two Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra (the great stellated dodecahedron and great icosahedron) do not have regular hyperbolic tiling analogues. If &quot;m&quot; is even, depending on how we choose to define {&quot;m&quot;/2}, we can either obtain degenerate double covers of other tilings or compound tilings.

====Skew apeirohedra in Euclidean 3-space====

There are three regular skew apeirohedra in Euclidean 3-space, with planar faces. They share the same vertex arrangement and edge arrangement of 3 convex uniform honeycombs.
* 6 squares around each vertex: {4,6|4}
* 4 hexagons around each vertex: {6,4|4}
* 6 hexagons around each vertex: {6,6|3}
Allowing for skew faces, there are 30 regular apeirohedra in Euclidean 3-space. These include the 12 blended apeirohedra created by blends with the Euclidean planar apeirohedra, and 18 pure apeirohedra, which cannot be expressed as a non-trivial blend including the planar apeirohedra and the three 3-dimensional apeirohedra above.

The 3-dimensional pure apeirohedra are:
*, the mucube
*, the Petrial of the mucube
*, the mutetrahedron
*, the Petrial of the mutetrahedron
*, the muoctahedron
*, the Petrial of the muoctahedron
*, the halving of the mucube
*, the Petrial of 
*, the skewing of the muoctahedron
*, the Petrial of 
*

====Skew apeirohedra in hyperbolic 3-space====
There are 31 regular skew apeirohedra with convex faces in hyperbolic 3-space with compact or paracompact symmetry:
* 14 are compact: {8,10|3}, {10,8|3}, {10,4|3}, {4,10|3}, {6,4|5}, {4,6|5}, {10,6|3}, {6,10|3}, {8,8|3}, {6,6|4}, {10,10|3},{6,6|5}, {8,6|3}, and {6,8|3}.
* 17 are paracompact: {12,10|3}, {10,12|3}, {12,4|3}, {4,12|3}, {6,4|6}, {4,6|6}, {8,4|4}, {4,8|4}, {12,6|3}, {6,12|3}, {12,12|3}, {6,6|6}, {8,6|4}, {6,8|4}, {12,8|3}, {8,12|3}, and {8,8|4}.

===4-apeirotopes===

====Tessellations of Euclidean 3-space====
There is only one non-degenerate regular tessellation of 3-space (&quot;honeycombs&quot;), {4, 3, 4}:

====Improper tessellations of Euclidean 3-space====

There are six improper regular tessellations, pairs based on the three regular Euclidean tilings. Their cells and vertex figures are all regular hosohedra {2,n}, dihedra, {n,2}, and Euclidean tilings. These improper regular tilings are constructionally related to prismatic uniform honeycombs by truncation operations. They are higher-dimensional analogues of the order-2 apeirogonal tiling and apeirogonal hosohedron.
====Tessellations of hyperbolic 3-space====
There are 15 flat regular honeycombs of hyperbolic 3-space:
*4 are compact: {3,5,3}, {4,3,5}, {5,3,4}, and {5,3,5}
*while 11 are paracompact: {3,3,6}, {6,3,3}, {3,4,4}, {4,4,3}, {3,6,3}, {4,3,6}, {6,3,4}, {4,4,4}, {5,3,6}, {6,3,5}, and {6,3,6}.
Tessellations of hyperbolic 3-space can be called &quot;hyperbolic honeycombs&quot;. There are 15 hyperbolic honeycombs in H3, 4 compact and 11 paracompact.

There are also 11 paracompact H3 honeycombs (those with infinite (Euclidean) cells and/or vertex figures): {3,3,6}, {6,3,3}, {3,4,4}, {4,4,3}, {3,6,3}, {4,3,6}, {6,3,4}, {4,4,4}, {5,3,6}, {6,3,5}, and {6,3,6}.

Noncompact solutions exist as Lorentzian Coxeter groups, and can be visualized with open domains in hyperbolic space (the fundamental tetrahedron having ultra-ideal vertices). All honeycombs with hyperbolic cells or vertex figures and do not have 2 in their Schläfli symbol are noncompact.
There are no regular hyperbolic star-honeycombs in H3: all forms with a regular star polyhedron as cell, vertex figure or both end up being spherical.

Ideal vertices now appear when the vertex figure is a Euclidean tiling, becoming inscribable in a horosphere rather than a sphere. They are dual to ideal cells (Euclidean tilings rather than finite polyhedra). As the last number in the Schläfli symbol rises further, the vertex figure becomes hyperbolic, and vertices become ultra-ideal (so the edges do not meet within hyperbolic space). In honeycombs {p, q, ∞} the edges intersect the Poincaré ball only in one ideal point; the rest of the edge has become ultra-ideal. Continuing further would lead to edges that are completely ultra-ideal, both for the honeycomb and for the fundamental simplex (though still infinitely many {p, q} would meet at such edges). In general, when the last number of the Schläfli symbol becomes ∞, faces of codimension two intersect the Poincaré hyperball only in one ideal point.

===5-apeirotopes===

====Tessellations of Euclidean 4-space====
There are three kinds of infinite regular tessellations (honeycombs) that can tessellate Euclidean four-dimensional space:

There are also the two improper cases {4,3,4,2} and {2,4,3,4}.

There are three flat regular honeycombs of Euclidean 4-space: 
* {4,3,3,4}, {3,3,4,3}, and {3,4,3,3}.

There are seven flat regular convex honeycombs of hyperbolic 4-space:
*5 are compact: {3,3,3,5}, {5,3,3,3}, {4,3,3,5}, {5,3,3,4}, {5,3,3,5} 
*2 are paracompact: {3,4,3,4}, and {4,3,4,3}.

There are four flat regular star honeycombs of hyperbolic 4-space:
* {5/2,5,3,3}, {3,3,5,5/2}, {3,5,5/2,5}, and {5,5/2,5,3}.

====Tessellations of hyperbolic 4-space====
There are seven convex regular honeycombs and four star-honeycombs in H4 space. Five convex ones are compact, and two are paracompact.

Five compact regular honeycombs in H4:
The two paracompact regular H4 honeycombs are: {3,4,3,4}, {4,3,4,3}.

Noncompact solutions exist as Lorentzian Coxeter groups, and can be visualized with open domains in hyperbolic space (the fundamental 5-cell having some parts inaccessible beyond infinity). All honeycombs which are not shown in the set of tables below and do not have 2 in their Schläfli symbol are noncompact.
====Star tessellations of hyperbolic 4-space====
There are four regular star-honeycombs in H4 space, all compact:
===6-apeirotopes===
There is only one flat regular honeycomb of Euclidean 5-space: (previously listed above as tessellations)
* {4,3,3,3,4}

There are five flat regular regular honeycombs of hyperbolic 5-space, all paracompact: (previously listed above as tessellations)
* {3,3,3,4,3}, {3,4,3,3,3}, {3,3,4,3,3}, {3,4,3,3,4}, and {4,3,3,4,3}

====Tessellations of Euclidean 5-space====
The hypercubic honeycomb is the only family of regular honeycombs that can tessellate each dimension, five or higher, formed by hypercube facets, four around every ridge.

In E5, there are also the improper cases {4,3,3,4,2}, {2,4,3,3,4}, {3,3,4,3,2}, {2,3,3,4,3}, {3,4,3,3,2}, and {2,3,4,3,3}. In E&quot;n&quot;, {4,3n−3,4,2} and {2,4,3n−3,4} are always improper Euclidean tessellations.

====Tessellations of hyperbolic 5-space====

There are 5 regular honeycombs in H5, all paracompact, which include infinite (Euclidean) facets or vertex figures: {3,4,3,3,3}, {3,3,4,3,3}, {3,3,3,4,3}, {3,4,3,3,4}, and {4,3,3,4,3}.

There are no compact regular tessellations of hyperbolic space of dimension 5 or higher and no paracompact regular tessellations in hyperbolic space of dimension 6 or higher.

Since there are no regular star &quot;n&quot;-polytopes for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5, that could be potential cells or vertex figures, there are no more hyperbolic star honeycombs in H&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5.

===Apeirotopes of rank 7 or more===

====Tessellations of hyperbolic 6-space and higher====
There are no regular compact or paracompact tessellations of hyperbolic space of dimension 6 or higher. However, any Schläfli symbol of the form {p,q,r,s...} not covered above (p,q,r,s... natural numbers above 2, or infinity) will form a noncompact tessellation of hyperbolic &quot;n&quot;-space.

== Abstract polytopes ==

The abstract polytopes arose out of an attempt to study polytopes apart from the geometrical space they are embedded in. They include the tessellations of spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic space, and of other manifolds. There are infinitely many of every rank greater than 1. See this atlas for a sample. Some notable examples of abstract regular polytopes that do not appear elsewhere in this list are the 11-cell, {3,5,3}, and the 57-cell, {5,3,5}, which have regular projective polyhedra as cells and vertex figures.

The elements of an abstract polyhedron are its body (the maximal element), its faces, edges, vertices and the &quot;null polytope&quot; or empty set. These abstract elements can be mapped into ordinary space or &quot;realised&quot; as geometrical figures. Some abstract polyhedra have well-formed or &quot;faithful&quot; realisations, others do not. A &quot;flag&quot; is a connected set of elements of each rank - for a polyhedron that is the body, a face, an edge of the face, a vertex of the edge, and the null polytope. An abstract polytope is said to be &quot;regular&quot; if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags - that is to say, that any flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. Abstract regular polytopes remain an active area of research.

Five such regular abstract polyhedra, which can not be realised faithfully and symmetrically, were identified by H. S. M. Coxeter in his book &quot;Regular Polytopes&quot; (1977) and again by J. M. Wills in his paper &quot;The combinatorially regular polyhedra of index 2&quot; (1987). They are all topologically equivalent to toroids. Their construction, by arranging &quot;n&quot; faces around each vertex, can be repeated indefinitely as tilings of the hyperbolic plane. In the diagrams below, the hyperbolic tiling images have colors corresponding to those of the polyhedra images.

These occur as dual pairs as follows:
*The medial rhombic triacontahedron and dodecadodecahedron are dual to each other.
*The medial triambic icosahedron and ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron are dual to each other.
*The excavated dodecahedron is self-dual.

<text>Almyros or Halmyros (, ) is a town and a municipality of the regional unit of Magnesia, region of Thessaly, Greece. It lies in the center of prosperous fertile plain known as &#x27;Krokio Pedio&#x27;, which is crossed by torrents. Almyros is an important agricultural and commercial center of Magnesia, and is also developing as a tourist center for the area. The main agricultural products are tomatoes, cotton, wheat, almonds, peanuts and pistachio nuts.

==History==
The history of Almyros begins with the ancient city of Halos (about 10 km [6.2 mi] south of Almyros), the ruins of which can still be visited. Halos was a very important and populous town, famous for its port and for its role in the Persian Wars. After the Byzantine Empire, because of pirate raids, they built the town in the place that it is today.

Ancient Halos was still mentioned in the works of Stephanus of Byzantium (6th century). The medieval successor settlement of Halmyros is first mentioned in the 11th century, when it was listed as a Christian diocese. During the Middle Ages, sources refer to &quot;two Halmyroi&quot; (&quot;δύο Άλμυροι&quot;): one of these was at the same site as ancient Halos, 6 km southeast of the present-day town of Almyros, while the other was an associated port on the Pagasitic Gulf.

At the old acropolis of Halos, the remains of a couple of stone towers (one at the highest point of the acropolis, the other at the base, overlooking the modern motorway) attest to the site&#x27;s continued existence in the Middle Ages. The lower town of Halmyros existed between two fortresses, one at the mouth of the Platanorrema and the other at the site of present-day Tsengeli (which is now inaccessible due to being the site of an airport). Almost nothing remains of either fortress. Remains of the old city walls have been found in the area between the two fortresses.

Medieval Halmyros owed a lot of its prosperity to the presence of Italian merchant groups who settled here (originally from places like Venice, Pisa, and Genoa). Several medieval Christian churches are attributed to these Italian communities: the church of St. George was built by the Venetians, and possibly also the now-gone church of St. Mark, while the former church of St. Jacob was built by the Pisans. There was also a strong Jewish community in medieval Halmyros. Warren Treadgold estimates the size of Halmyros&#x27;s Jewish community at about 400 people during the 12th century.

In 1158, Halmyros was attacked and plundered by a naval force commanded by William I of Sicily. The Pisan church of St. Jacob was burned down in the attack. Halmyros&#x27;s Venetian community was hit badly by the arrest of all Venetians living in Byzantine territory in 1171. In 1198, the &quot;two Halmyroi&quot; were mentioned for the first time, in a document under Alexios III Angelos granting special privileges to the Venetians. In the 1204 &quot;Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae&quot; after the sack of Constantinople, the &quot;duo Almiri&quot; are mentioned among the Thessalian possessions of Alexios&#x27;s wife, Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera. Halmyros was then assigned by Boniface of Montferrat as the place where the former Alexios III would reside as a private citizen. Later, Halmyros became a property of William of Larissa and later still was assigned to Margaret of Hungary, Boniface of Montferrat&#x27;s widow.

Halmyros remained under Latin control until 1246, when it was reconquered by Michael II of Epirus. In 1259, Halmyros is attested as a theme. In 1265, a Venetian quarter was re-established in Halmyros, after the Venetians had previously been expelled. Rampant piracy is described as happening in the Halmyros area in the next decade, sometime before 1278. Halmyros was sacked in 1307, and in 1310 it was captured by the Catalan Company along with several other towns in southern Thessaly (namely Domokos, Gardikia, and Pharsalos).

Halmyros was the site of the decisive Battle of Halmyros on 15 March 1311, where the Catalan Company shattered the assembled feudal armies of Frankish Greece and conquered the Duchy of Athens.

In the 1300s, Halmyros began to lose its importance as a port town; the newly founded town of Golos (modern Volos) took its place.

In 1881 Almyros, along with most of Thessaly, was ceded to Greece.

In 1980 a catastrophic magnitude 6.5 earthquake destroyed most of the town.

==Municipality==
The municipality Almyros was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Almyros
*Anavra
*Pteleos
*Sourpi

The municipality has an area of 905.4 km2 (349.6 sq mi), the municipal unit 473.940 km2 (183 sq mi).

===Subdivisions===
The municipal unit of Almyros is divided into the following communities: Almyros, Efxeinoupoli, Anthotopos, Kokkotoi, Kroki, Kofoi, Platanos, and Fylaki.

==Province==
The province of Almyros () was one of the provinces of Magnesia. It had the same territory as the present municipality. It was abolished in 2006.

==Landmarks==
*The Archaeological Museum of Almyros includes local artifacts and exhibits from the Neolithic period, through Mycenean, Geometric, Classical, Hellenistic periods, and later Roman years. Opposite the museum is the old High School, the Gymnasium of Almyros, which is a classic monumental building from the beginning of the 20th century. The Museum and Gymnasium are the oldest buildings in the area.
*The Kouri forest, about 2 km from the town of Almyros, at an elevation of 75 m (246 ft), encompasses 108 ha (266.9 acres) of lowland oak forest. The forest is flat (elevation gradient is less than 2%). Oaks belong to the species: Quercus pubescens, Quercus aegilops, Quercus pedunculiflora. There are footpaths, as well as a miniature train for a brief tour through the woods and over small bridges.
*The area is important to migratory birds, such as the mute swan, spoonbill, glossy ibis, and various herons.
*South of the town are the moderately wooded Othrys mountains. 17 km (10.6 mi) from the town of Almyros but still in Almyros province, high in the Othrys mountains, is the 12th century Monastery of Panagia Xenia, with wall paintings, treasuries, and a library.
*There are several sandy beaches in the municipality of Almyros.
*Almyros has three main churches: Agios Dimitrios, Agios Nikolaos and Evangelistria.

==Geography==
Almyros is situated near the western end of the Pagasetic Gulf, 25 km (15.5 mi) southwest of Volos. The A1 motorway (Athens–Thessaloniki–Evzonoi) passes east of the town Almyros.

<text>Zarma (&quot;Zarma Ciine/Sanni&quot;; Ajami: ) is one of the Songhay languages. It is the leading indigenous language of the southwestern lobe of the West African nation of Niger, where the Niger River flows and the capital city, Niamey, is located. Zarma is the second-most common language in the country, after Hausa, which is spoken in south-central Niger. With over 6 million speakers, Zarma is easily the most widely spoken Songhay language.

In earlier decades, Zarma was rendered &quot;Djerma&quot;, using French orthography, but it is usually now &#x27;Zarma&#x27;, the form that the Zarma people use in their language.

Alternative names for Zarma are Djerma, Jerma, Dyabarma, Dyarma, Dyerma, Adzerma, Zabarma, Zarbarma, Zarmaci or Zerma.

==Geographic distribution==
The majority of people who speak Zarma live in Southwestern Niger. It is also spoken in other parts of Niger and in neighbouring countries. Cities where Zarma is spoken include Tillaberi, Dosso, Niamey, Tahoua and Agadez.

In Nigeria, where the Zarma people are usually referred to as Zabarma or Zabarmawa, they are located in bordering States such as Kebbi, near Nguru Road in Yobe State and communities in Niger State.

===Communities===
Outside Niger, Nigeria and Mali, communities of speakers are found in the following other countries:
*Northern Benin
*Sahel Region and Est Region, Burkina Faso
*Urban Areas in Northern Ghana
*Savanes District, Ivory Coast
*Kara Region and Savanes Region, Togo
*Northern Cameroon
*Sudan

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===

There are ten vowels: the five oral vowels (, , , , ) and their nasalized counterparts. There is slight variation, both allophonic and dialectal. Vowel length is phonemically distinctive. There are a number of combinations of a vowel with a semivowel or , the semivowel being initial or final.

===Consonants===
The combinations and usually have some palatal quality to them and may even be interchangeable with and in the speech of many people.

All consonants may be short, and all consonants except /c/, /h/, /f/ and /z/ may be long. (In some dialects, long /f/ exists in the word &quot;goffo&quot;.)

===Lexical tone and stress===
Zarma is a tonal language with four tones: high, low, fall and rise. In Dosso, some linguists (such as Tersis) have observed a dipping (falling-rising) tone for certain words: &quot;ma&quot; (&quot;the name&quot;).

Stress is generally unimportant in Zarma. According to Abdou Hamani (1980), two-syllable words are stressed on their first syllable unless that syllable is just a short vowel: a-, i- or u-. Three-syllable words have stress on their second syllable. The first consonant of a stressed syllable is pronounced a bit more strongly, and the vowel in the preceding syllable is weakened. Only emphasized words have a stressed syllable. There is no change of tone for a stressed syllable.

== Orthography ==

Zarma is primarily written in either Latin alphabet or Arabic alphabet (Ajami). Zarma as well as other Songhay languages, and other indigenous languages of the Sahel such as Fula and Hausa have been written in Arabic alphabet for centuries. The tradition of writing in Arabic dates back to the arrival of Islam via merchants of the Trans-Saharan trade, as early as the 12th century. The tradition of Arabic script in the Sahel and Sub-Saharan Africa came to be known as Ajami. Ajami has its own unique characteristics across various languages that differ from the Perso-Arabic tradition or Jawi tradition of Southeast Asia for example.

Latin alphabet came to be used for Zarma and other indigenous languages of the region in the beginning of the 19th century with the arrival of European Christian Missionaries and colonial administrators.

===Latin alphabet===

Table below illustrates the letters used in the Zarma Latin alphabet:

Nasal vowels are written with a tilde or a following or . Officially, the tilde should go under the vowel (&quot;so̰ho̰&quot;), but many current works write the tilde over the vowel (&quot;sõhõ&quot;). Also, v may be used in a few words of foreign origin, but many Zarma cannot pronounce it.

Most of the letters are pronounced with the same values as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the exceptions being (approximately English &quot;j&quot; but more palatalized), , (a flap). The letter is approximately like English &quot;ch&quot; but more palatalized. The palatal nasal is spelled in older works.

Long consonants are written with double letters; is a trilled . Long vowels are sometimes but inconsistently written with double letter. In older works, was spelled or . Both and are pronounced as a labiodental nasal before .

Tone is not written unless the word is ambiguous. Then, the standard IPA diacritics are used: &quot;bá&quot; (&quot;to be a lot&quot;: high tone), &quot;bà&quot; (&quot;to share&quot;: low tone), &quot;bâ&quot; (&quot;to want&quot; or &quot;even&quot;: falling tone) and &quot;bǎ&quot; (&quot;to be better&quot;: rising tone). However, the meaning is almost always unambiguous in the context so the words are usually all written &quot;ba&quot;.

===Arabic alphabet===

Table below illustrates the Arabic (Ajami) alphabet for Zarma, based on UNESCO.BREDA report on standardization of Arabic script in published in 1987 in Bamako.

Arabic alphabet for Songhay languages in Niger differs in 5 characters from that of Mali. Otherwise, the two orthographies are the same, especially in how vowels are written.

==Morphology==
=== General ===
There are many suffixes in Zarma. There are very few prefixes, and only one (&quot;a-/i-&quot; before adjectives and numbers) is common.

====Nouns====
Nouns may be singular or plural. There are also three &quot;forms&quot; that indicate whether the noun is indefinite, definite or demonstrative. &quot;Form&quot; and number are indicated conjointly by an enclitic on the noun phrase. The singular definite enclitic is -ǒ or -ǎ. Some authors always write the ending with a rising tone mark even if it is not ambiguous and even if it is not truly a rising tone. The other endings are in the table below. The definite and the demonstrative endings replace any final vowel. See Hamani (1980) for a discussion on when to add -ǒ or -ǎ as well as other irregularities. See Tersis (1981) for a discussion of the complex changes in tone that may occur.
For example, &quot;súsúbày&quot; means &quot;morning&quot; (indefinite singular); &quot;súsúbǎ&quot; means &quot;the morning&quot; (definite singular); and &quot;súsúbô&quot; means &quot;this morning&quot; (demonstrative singular).

The indefinite plural -yáŋ ending is often used like English &quot;some&quot;. &quot;Ay no leemuyaŋ&quot; means &quot;Give me some oranges.&quot; Usually, the singular forms are used if the plurality is indicated by a number or other contextual clue, especially for the indefinite form: &quot;Soboro ga ba&quot; (&quot;There are a lot of mosquitoes&quot;); &quot;ay zanka hinkǎ&quot; (&quot;my two children&quot;); &quot;hasaraw hinko kulu ra&quot; (&quot;in both of these catastrophes&quot;).

There is no gender or case in Zarma so the third-person singular pronoun &quot;a&quot; can mean &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;hers&quot;, &quot;its&quot;, &quot;one&quot; or &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;, according to the context and its position in the sentence.

===Verbs===
Verbs do not have tenses and are not conjugated. There are at least three aspects for verbs that are indicated by a modal word before the verb and any object nouns. The aspects are the completive (&quot;daahir gasu&quot;), the incompletive (&quot;daahir gasu si&quot;) and the subjunctive (&quot;afiri ŋwaaray nufa&quot;). (Beginning grammars for foreigners sometimes inaccurately call the first two &quot;past and present tenses&quot;.) There is also an imperative and a continuing or progressive construction. Lack of a modal marker indicates either the affirmative completive aspect (if there is a subject and no object) or the singular affirmative imperative (if there is no subject). There is a special modal marker, &quot;ka&quot; or &quot;ga&quot;, according to the dialect, to indicate the completive aspect with emphasis on the subject. Different markers are used to indicate a negative sentence.
Linguists do not agree on the tone for &quot;ga&quot;. Some say that it is high before a low tone and low before a high tone.

There are several words in Zarma to translate the English &quot;to be&quot;. The defective verb &quot;tí&quot; is used to equate two noun phrases, with the emphasized completive &quot;ka/ga&quot;, as in &quot;Ay ma ka ti Yakuba&quot; (&quot;My name is Yakuba&quot;). The existential &quot;gǒ&quot; (negative &quot;sí&quot;) is not a verb (White-Kaba, 1994, calls it a &quot;verboid&quot;) and has no aspect; it means &quot;exist&quot; and usually links a noun phrase to a descriptive term, such as a place, a price or a participle: &quot;A go fuwo ra&quot; (&quot;She&#x27;s in the house&quot;). The predicative &quot;nô&quot; means &quot;it is&quot;, &quot;they are&quot;, etc. and is one of the most common words in Zarma. It has no aspect or negative form and is placed after a noun phrase, sometimes for emphasis: &quot;Ni do no ay ga koy&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s to your house I&#x27;m going&quot;). Other words, such as &quot;gòró&quot;, &quot;cíyà&quot;, &quot;tíyà&quot; and &quot;bárà&quot; are much rarer and usually express ideas, such as the subjunctive, which &quot;gǒ&quot; and &quot;tí&quot; cannot handle.

Participles can be formed with the suffix &quot;-ànté&quot;, which is similar in meaning to the past participle in English. It can also be added to quantities to form ordinal numbers and to some nouns to form adjectives. A sort of gerund can be formed by adding &quot;-yàŋ&quot;, which transforms the verb into a noun. There are many other suffixes that can make nouns out of verbs, but only &quot;-yàŋ&quot; works with all verbs.

Two verbs can be related with the word &quot;ká&quot;. (In many dialects it is &quot;gá&quot;, not to be confused with the incompletive aspect marker or the emphasized completive marker.) The connector &quot;ká&quot; implies that the second verb is a result of the first or that the first is the reason or cause of the second: &quot;ka ga ŋwa&quot;, &quot;come (in order to) eat.&quot; A large number of idiomatic expressions are expressed with it: &quot;sintin ga ...&quot; or &quot;sintin ka&quot; means &quot;to begin to ...&quot;, &quot;ban ga ...&quot; means &quot;to have already ...&quot;, &quot;ba ga ...&quot; means &quot;to be about to ..., &quot;gay ga ...&quot; means &quot;it&#x27;s been awhile since ...&quot;, &quot;haw ga ...&quot; means &quot;to purposely ...&quot; and so on.

==Syntax==
Zarma&#x27;s normal word order is subject–object–verb. The object is normally placed before the verb but may be placed after the verb for emphasis, and a few common verbs require the object after them. Unlike English, which places prepositions before a noun, Zarma has postpositions, which are placed after the noun: &quot;fuwo ra&quot; (in the house), &quot;fuwo jine&quot; (in front of the house).

When two nouns are placed together, the first noun modifies the second, showing possession, purpose or description: &quot;Fati tirǎ&quot; (Fati&#x27;s book), &quot;haŋyaŋ hari&quot; (drinking water), &quot;fu meeyo&quot; (the door of a house). The same construction occurs with a pronoun before a noun: &quot;ni baaba&quot; (&quot;your father&quot;). All other modifiers of a noun (adjectives, articles, numbers, demonstratives etc.) are placed after the noun: &quot;Ay baaba wura muusu boŋey&quot; (&quot;My father&#x27;s gold lion heads&quot;, Tersis, 1981).

Here is a proverb in Zarma:

That means that &quot;you need to hear both sides of the story&quot;.

<text>Terence Peter Michael Frisby (performing name Terence Holland; 28 November 1932 – 22 April 2020) was a British playwright, actor, director and producer, best known as the author of the play &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot;.

==Early life==
Frisby was born in 1932 in New Cross, south-east London, the second son of William Frisby, who worked on the railways, and Kathleen (née Campbell), who was employed in a department store. He was educated at Dartford Grammar School leaving aged 16 becoming a tailor&#x27;s apprentice. He remained in the occupation for six years before gaining a place at the Central School of Speech and Drama and training to become an actor. He worked in repertory theatre under the name Terence Holland from 1957 to 1966. Under his stage name, he was also a presenter on the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s series &quot;Play School&quot; during the 1960s.

==Plays and other work==

&quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot; opened in 1966 at the Globe Theatre (now called the Gielgud Theatre) and ran for over 1,000 performances, before transferring to the Comedy Theatre for a further three years. It was a worldwide hit with runs on Broadway, Paris (with Gérard Depardieu), Madrid (with Concha Velasco), Berlin, Stockholm, Sydney, Rome (starring Domenico Modugno), Vienna, Prague and elsewhere. His script for the 1970 film, which starred Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn, won the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain Award in 1970 for the Best British Comedy Screenplay.

His other stage plays include &quot;The Subtopians&quot; (Arts Theatre 1964), &quot;The Bandwagon&quot; (Mermaid Theatre 1969), &quot;It&#x27;s All Right If I Do It&quot; (Mermaid 1977), &quot;Seaside Postcard&quot; (Young Vic 1978), &quot;Rough Justice&quot; (Apollo Theatre 1994), and &quot;Funny About Love&quot; (two UK national tours 1999–2000). All his plays are published by Samuel French. The first performance of &quot;The Subtopians&quot; was in fact at the Guildford Theatre in the week of 26 March 1962. The second production, which transferred to the Arts Theatre in the West End in 1964, was directed by himself at Bromley Repertory Theatre, where he was working as a member of the rep company.

Frisby also wrote many plays for television, two of which were nominated for awards. His comedy series include &quot;Lucky Feller&quot; (1976) with David Jason (1976) and &quot;That&#x27;s Love&quot; (1988–92) with Jimmy Mulville, Diana Hardcastle, and Tony Slattery, which won the Gold Award for Comedy at the 1991 Houston International Film Festival.

His radio play &quot;Just Remember Two Things: It&#x27;s Not Fair And Don&#x27;t Be Late&quot; for BBC Radio 4 won The Giles Cooper Award. A musical stage version was produced at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Barnstaple in 2004 under the title &quot;Just Remember Two Things...&quot; A second production of the same show, under the title &quot;Kisses on a Postcard&quot;, was produced in 2011 at the same venue.

Frisby&#x27;s book, &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1998), is an autobiographical account addressed to his son, Dominic Frisby, about his fifteen years as a litigant-in-person in the High Court following his divorce in 1971 from the model Christine Doppelt and his custody claim involving their son, who is now an author and comedian. Terence Frisby&#x27;s second book is &quot;Kisses on a Postcard&quot;, published by Bloomsbury.(). It tells of his experiences as an evacuee as a 7-year-old from London to Cornwall during World War Two. It is based on the musical of the same name.

Frisby worked for over 50 years as an actor, director and producer. He played leads and directed in the West End, at the Young Vic and elsewhere in the UK. A presentation as a producer was the South African, multi-award-winning &quot;Woza Albert!&quot; at the Criterion Theatre in 1984. It was subsequently performed off-Broadway and worldwide.

Frisby was a founder member of the father&#x27;s rights and support group Families Need Fathers, but became distant from the group terming it &quot;Nippers Need Nutters&quot;.
He died in April 2020, aged 87,
from the side effects of treatment three years earlier for bladder cancer, which he did not have.

<doc id="505259" wikidata="Q526220" url="?curid=505259" title="Frank Knox">
<text>William Franklin Knox (January 1, 1874 – April 28, 1944) was an American politician, soldier, newspaper editor, and publisher. He was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 1936 and Secretary of the Navy under Franklin D. Roosevelt during most of World War II.

Born in Boston, he attended Alma College and served with the Rough Riders during the Spanish–American War. After the war, he became a newspaper editor in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and state chairman of the Republican Party. He was a leading supporter of Theodore Roosevelt, the Progressive candidate for president in 1912. He advocated U.S. entrance into World War I and served as an artillery officer in France. The 1936 Republican National Convention nominated a ticket of Alf Landon and Knox, and they were defeated by Roosevelt and John Nance Garner in the 1936 election.

After World War II broke out in 1939, Knox supported aid to the Allies. In 1940, Roosevelt appointed him as Secretary of the Navy in hopes of building bipartisan support. Knox brought in James Forrestal as the under secretary. They presided over a massive naval buildup but were dissatisfied by the confused chain of command in Hawaii. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Knox brought in a much more aggressive admiral, Ernest J. King. Roosevelt worked closely with King and largely neglected Knox. During the war, Knox continued his supervision of the &quot;Chicago Daily News,&quot; while Forrestal expanded his role and supervised the nonmilitary aspects of the department in terms of contracts and recruitment. Knox served as secretary of the Navy until his death in 1944, when Forrestal replaced him.

==Early life==
William Franklin Knox was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were both Canadian; his mother, Sarah C. (Barnard), was from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and his father, William Edwin Knox, was from New Brunswick. When he was nine, his family moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where his father ran a grocery store. He attended Alma College in Michigan, where he was a member of the Zeta Sigma fraternity. He left in his senior year to join the US Army for the Spanish–American War. He later supplemented his studies with additional readings and coursework, and the college&#x27;s board of trustees awarded him a Bachelor of Arts degree as a member of the class of 1898.

He served in Cuba with Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s famous Rough Riders, the First Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. He was a member of Troop D commanded by Captain Robert Huston. As a member of D Troop, Knox fought in Cuba at the Battle of Las Guasimas, and the Battle of San Juan Hill.

== Newspapers and politics ==

After the war, Knox became a newspaper reporter in Grand Rapids, which was the beginning of a career that included ownership of several papers.
He changed his first name to Frank around 1900. He was state chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. In 1912, he was a key organizer for the presidential ambitions of Theodore Roosevelt.

In late 1912, Knox helped found the &quot;Manchester Leader&quot; in New Hampshire. It was financed by Governor Robert P. Bass, a member of the Progressive or Bull Moose Party). The newspaper was so successful that Knox bought out the Manchester &quot;Union&quot;. The two newspapers merged under the banner of the Union-Leader Corporation July 1913. Both papers espoused a moderate Republican, probusiness stance.

During World War I, Knox was an advocate of U.S. military preparedness and then of participation in the war. When the U.S. declared war on Germany in 1917, he rejoined the Army. He reached the rank of Colonel and served as an artillery officer in France. After the war he returned to the newspaper business.

In 1931, Frank Knox became publisher and part owner of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. In the 1936 election, he was the Republican nominee for vice president under Alf Landon. Landon, Knox, and former President Herbert Hoover were the only supporters of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 who were later named to a Republican ticket. They lost in a landslide, winning just Maine and Vermont against the Democratic ticket of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner.

== World War II ==

During World War II, Knox again was an advocate of preparedness. As an internationalist, he supported aid to the Allies and opposed isolationism. In July 1940, he became secretary of the Navy under Roosevelt with Henry L. Stimson as Secretary of War, part of the Democratic president&#x27;s effort to build bipartisan support for his foreign and defense policies following the defeat of France. Knox carried out Roosevelt&#x27;s plan to expand the US Navy into a force capable of fighting in both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Knox was mentioned by name in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s speech of December 11, 1941, in which Hitler stated a German declaration of war against the United States.

When a new naval officer on Knox&#x27;s staff told him, &quot;I&#x27;m no New Dealer,&quot; Knox replied, &quot;I fought the President with every resource at my command. But now I&#x27;ve squared my politics with my conscience and I&#x27;m proud to serve under such a great man. At that,&quot; Knox added, &quot;it&#x27;s a good thing to have a couple of fellows around here who &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot; New Dealers!&quot; He traveled extensively to Navy installations worldwide. Knox also supported the continued racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces.

===Internment of Japanese Americans===
Knox had called for the internment of Japanese Americans as early as 1933, and he continued to do so in his new position. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he visited Hawaii to investigate the sabotage that he believed to have taken place there. Upon his return, he issued a public statement that &quot;the most effective Fifth Column work of the entire war was done in Hawaii with the exception of Norway,&quot; and he accused Japanese Hawaiians of impeding US defense efforts in a report to the President. Although the FBI and military intelligence later disproved those claims, Knox continued to push for the internment of Japanese Americans and barred them from service in the Navy during the war.

==Death==
Following a brief series of heart attacks, Secretary Knox died in Washington, D.C., on April 28, 1944, while still in office. He was buried on May 1, 1944, at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

==Posthumous honors and memorials==
The , commissioned in December 1944, was named in his honor.

On May 31, 1945, he received posthumously the Medal for Merit from President Harry S. Truman. He also received the Spanish Campaign Medal and the World War I Victory Medal for his previous military service.

In 1948, his widow, Annie Reid Knox (1875–1958) endowed the Frank Knox Memorial Fellowships, which allow scholars from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and the United Kingdom to pursue graduate study at Harvard University, or by recent graduates of Harvard to travel and research in the countries of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

Frank Knox School on the grounds of the Patuxent River Naval Air Station was named for him.

<doc id="505260" wikidata="Q2360220" url="?curid=505260" title="Pōkarekare Ana">
<text>&quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot; is a traditional New Zealand love song, probably communally composed about the time World War I began in 1914. The song is written in Māori and has been translated into English. It enjoys widespread popularity in New Zealand as well as some popularity in other countries.

==Composition==
Eastern Maori politicians Paraire Tomoana and Āpirana Ngata published the song in 1919, but neither of them claimed to have composed it. They explained that it had &quot;emanated North of Auckland&quot; and was popularised by Māori soldiers who were training near Auckland before embarking for the war in Europe.

The Māori words have remained virtually unaltered over the decades, with only the waters in the first line being localized. For example, some versions refer to Lake Rotorua in the North Island. It is then associated with the story of Hinemoa swimming across the lake to her forbidden lover, Tūtānekai, on Mokoia Island. However, there have been many different English translations.

&quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot; was originally written predominantly in triple time, with the verse in duple time, but has been more commonly heard in duple time since World War II.

==Lyrics and melody==

==Use==
The song is very popular in New Zealand, and has been adapted for multiple purposes, including in advertising and by sporting groups. Notable uses include:
*&quot;Sailing Away&quot;, which promoted New Zealand&#x27;s 1987 America&#x27;s Cup challenge, and featured an ensemble choir of famous New Zealanders recording as &quot;All of Us&quot;.
*It was used in multiple TV advertisements for Air New Zealand in the 1990s (using a recording with Kiri Te Kanawa) and in 2000. Air New Zealand also used the song again in 2020 to mark the 80th birthday of New Zealand&#x27;s national airline, this time, using a recording from Hayley Westenra.
*In April 2013, members and spectators in the New Zealand Parliament sang &quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot; after the house passed the bill legalising same-sex marriage in New Zealand.

In popular culture, &quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot; was used as the theme song for the 2005 South Korean film &quot;Crying Fist&quot;.

In the 2019 DLC for Civilization VI, Gathering Storm, the main theme for the added Māori civilization is Pōkarekare Ana and Ka Mate. There are four renditions of the theme, each corresponding to a different era in the game. These renditions were composed by Geoff Knorr and Phill Boucher.

==Versions==

===Recordings===
Dozens of recording artists throughout the world have performed and recorded the song.

A version of &quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot; by Rhonda Bryers appears on the 1981 CBS various artists album &quot;The Mauri Hikitia&quot;.

Richard Clayderman recorded an instrumental version in 1984, which appeared on the album &quot;Memories&quot;.

Among New Zealand opera singers to record and perform &quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot; are Kiri Te Kanawa and Malvina Major.

&quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot; was featured on the 2003 album &quot;Pure&quot;, by the New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra.

A version of the song features on the self-titled album by Angelis, a British classical crossover singing group.

On the CD &quot;Classical-Crossover Compilation 2011&quot;, Hollie Steel sings &quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot;. Steel later released the song as a charity single for those suffering from the 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand.

===Adaptations===
It was known that the song was introduced to South Korea by New Zealand soldiers fighting in the Korean War (although there is no record of New Zealand soldiers spreading the song during Korean War). It was eventually given Korean lyrics and a Korean title, &quot;Yeonga&quot; (), and has become popular across the country.

The melody of &quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot; was used for an Irish hymn to the Blessed Virgin: &quot;A Mhuire Mháthair, sé seo mo ghuí&quot;.

A homophonous translation into Hebrew was composed in 2007 by Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann. In this translation the approximate sounds of the Māori words are retained while Hebrew words with similar meanings are used. In this translation, however, &quot;Waiapu&quot; is replaced by &quot;Rotorua&quot; (oto rúakh, Hebrew for &quot;that wind&quot;).

<text>Etienne Henri &quot;Hans&quot; Larive, MWO, DSC and bar, (23 September 1915 – 28 December 1984) was a Dutch naval officer during World War II. He escaped from the prisoner of war camp Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle in 1941, and spent the rest of the war in England serving aboard Motor Torpedo Boats. He later wrote his memoir &quot;Vannacht varen de Hollanders&quot; (1950), which was republished translated into English as &quot;The Man Who Came in From Colditz&quot; (1975) – a pun on the best-selling novel &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;.

==Early life==
Larive was born on 23 September 1915 in Singapore. He entered the Royal Netherlands Naval College (KIM) in 1934, graduating in 1937, and gaining his commission as &quot;Luitenant ter Zee (3de klasse)&quot; on 13 August that year. He was promoted to &quot;Luitenant ter Zee (2de klasse)&quot; on 13 August 1939.

==World War II==
In May 1940, just a few days before the Germans attacked Holland, he returned from his tour of duty in the Dutch East Indies as Navigation Officer aboard the Admiralen class destroyer HNLMS &quot;Van Galen&quot;. On 10 May 1940 the Germans invaded, and the &quot;Van Galen&quot; was sent to shell German paratroopers who had landed around Rotterdam and Waalhaven airport. The ship had to steam into the narrow Nieuwe Waterweg, where she was attacked and soon sunk by Stuka dive-bombers.

=== The &#x27;Singen&#x27; route ===
After the Dutch capitulation, all officers were required to give their not to take part in any hostile activities against the Germans. About 60 officers including Larive, and one rating, refused, and were sent to German POW camps. The first was Oflag VI-A in Soest, Germany, where Larive made his first escape attempt in October 1940. This attempt brought him near to Singen, close to the Swiss border, where he was arrested. Convinced that Germany would soon win the war, the interrogating Gestapo officer arrogantly showed Larive how he would have crossed the Swiss border without problems. Larive later passed this valuable information on, and many Dutch and British prisoners used the &quot;Singen route&quot; to enter Switzerland. After this escape attempt all Dutch POW&#x27;s were moved to Oflag VIII-C near Juliusburg, but after another successful escape by two officers they were all moved again in July 1941 to the maximum security camp (&quot;Sonderlager&quot;) Oflag IV-C at Colditz.

===Escaping Colditz===

At Colditz all Dutch escapes were coordinated by the Dutch escape officer Captain Machiel van den Heuvel, known as &quot;Vandy&quot; by the British. Van den Heuvel quickly recognised the possibilities of the exercise park and soon had his first escape plan ready. On 15 August 1941 Larive and Lieutenant Francis Steinmetz hid under a manhole cover under the cover of a rugby scrum. Lieutenant Gerrit Dames then created a diversion by cutting a hole in the barbed wire fence, before allowing himself to be caught, shouting to imaginary escapers to run, so that the Germans would think that the missing officers had already escaped.

Larive and Steinmetz hid for several hours. The cover was fixed with a heavy bolt, which Van den Heuvel had replaced with a fake made of glass. Once it was dark the two men forced the manhole cover open from below, and replaced the now broken glass bolt with the original one. They then made their way out of the castle. (This escape method was repeated on 20 September 1941 by two other Dutch officers, Conrad Giebel and Oscar Ludwig Drijber.). At Leisnig Larive and Steinmetz took a train to Nuremberg where they waited for their next train in a nearby park. To avoid attracting unwanted attention, they pretended to be a courting couple, with Steinmetz pulling a blanket down over his shorts so it looked like a skirt. They crossed the Swiss border on 18 August 1941.

Under Swiss neutrality law they were not allowed to leave the country, so the Dutch Legation provided false papers describing them as sugar planters on their way to Cuba. They travelled on a sealed train in which neutrals were able to pass through France into Spain. At Barcelona they boarded the neutral ship, &quot;Isla de Teneriffe&quot;, sailing for Havana. The ship was intercepted by a Royal Navy cutter in the Strait of Gibraltar and the two men were taken off and arrived in Gibraltar on 4 November. They then sailed to England aboard the submarine HNLMS &quot;O 21&quot; and arrived in London on 17 December 1941.

=== MTB commander===
In March 1942 Larive was assigned to command of the Dutch Motor Torpedo Boat &quot;MTB 203&quot;, part of the Anglo-Dutch 9th MTB Flotilla. Later the 9th Flotilla became wholly Dutch, and Larive commanded it from October 1942 until October 1943. He then became the Senior Officer of all Dutch MTBs (commanding the 2nd and 9th MTB Flotillas) until 16 September 1944, with the rank of Temporary Acting &quot;Luitenant ter Zee 1ste klasse&quot;. The Dutch MTB service was disbanded on 5 September 1944, and its personnel were reassigned to &quot;Port Parties&quot;, operating in liberated areas of the Netherlands. Larive then became head of the Dutch Naval Press Agency MARVO (&quot;Marine Voorlichting Dienst&quot;), a post he held until leaving the navy on 1 July 1946.

==Post-war==
Larive was employed by the Royal Dutch Shell company from 1 September 1946. Between December 1951 and May 1954 he was a Deputy Director of &quot;N.V. Curaçaose Scheepvaart Maatschappij&quot; (Curaçao Shipping Company), a Shell subsidiary.

In 1950, he published his wartime memoirs entitled &quot;Vannacht varen de Hollanders&quot; (&quot;The Dutch Sail Tonight&quot;), later published in English as &quot;The Man Who Came in From Colditz&quot;. He died at The Hague on 28 December 1984.

<doc id="505264" wikidata="Q2121349" url="?curid=505264" title="Maidenhead Locator System">
<text>The Maidenhead Locator System (a.k.a. QTH Locator and IARU Locator) is a geocode system used by amateur radio operators to succinctly describe their geographic coordinates, which replaced the deprecated QRA locator, which was limited to European contacts. Its purpose is to be concise, accurate, and robust in the face of interference and other adverse transmission conditions. The &quot;Maidenhead Locator System&quot; can describe locations anywhere in the world.

Maidenhead locators are also commonly referred to as &quot;QTH locators&quot;, &quot;grid locators&quot; or &quot;grid squares&quot;, although the &quot;squares&quot; are distorted on any non-equirectangular cartographic projection. Use of the terms &quot;QTH locator&quot; and &quot;QRA locator&quot; was initially discouraged, as it caused confusion with the older QRA locator system. The only abbreviation recommended to indicate a Maidenhead reference in Morse code and radio teleprinter transmission was LOC, as in LOC KN28LH.

John Morris G4ANB originally devised the system and it was adopted at a meeting of the IARU VHF Working Group in Maidenhead, England in 1980.

==History==
Amateur radio contests on VHF and UHF are often scored based on the distance of contacts, typically 1 point per kilometre, so there is a need for amateurs to exchange their locations over the air. To facilitate this, following the growth of the sport in the 1950s, the German QRA locator system was adopted in 1959. The QRA locator system was limited to describing European coordinates, and by the mid-1970s there was growing need for a global locator system.

By the time of their April 1980 meeting, in Maidenhead, England, the VHF Working Group had received twenty different proposals to replace the QRA locator grid. That devised by John Morris (G4ANB) was deemed to be the best.

At the 1999 IARU Conference in Lillehammer it was decided that the latitude and longitude to be used as a reference for the determining of locators should be based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).

==Description of the system==

A Maidenhead locator compresses latitude and longitude into a short string of characters, which is similar in concept to the World Geographic Reference System or GEOREF. This position information is presented in a limited level of precision to limit the number of characters needed for its transmission using voice, Morse code, or any other operating mode.

The chosen coding uses alternating pairs of letters and digits, like so:

* BL11BH16

In each pair, the first character encodes longitude and the second character encodes latitude. These character pairs also have traditional names, and in the case of letters, the range of characters (or &quot;encoding base number&quot;) used in each pair does vary.
To avoid negative numbers in the input data, the system specifies that latitude is measured from the South Pole to the North Pole, and longitude measured eastward from the antimeridian of Greenwich, giving the prime meridian a false easting of 180° and the equator a false northing of 90°.

To simplify manual encoding, the base for the first pair of letters—traditionally called a &quot;field&quot;—was chosen to be 18, thus dividing the globe into 18 zones of longitude of 20° each, and 18 zones of latitude 10° each. These zones are encoded with the letters &quot;A&quot; through &quot;R&quot;.
The second pair of numbers, called a &quot;square&quot; and placed after the first pair of letters, uses a base number of 10, and is encoded using the digits &quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot;. This is where the alternative name &quot;grid squares&quot; comes from. Each of these squares represents 1° of latitude by 2° of longitude.
For additional precision, each square can optionally be sub-divided further, into &quot;subsquares&quot;. These are encoded into a second pair of letters, which should be presented in uppercase, but are sometimes (incorrectly) presented in lowercase as a legacy from the old QRA. The error has unfortunately been incorporated into various software packages, several examples of which can be seen on this page. Again, to make manual calculations from degrees and minutes easier, 24 was chosen as the base number, giving these subsquares dimensions of 2.5&#x27; of latitude by 5&#x27; of longitude. The letters used are &quot;A&quot; through &quot;X&quot;.

The resulting Maidenhead subsquare locator string is hence composed of two letters, two digits, and two more letters. To give an example, W1AW, the American Radio Relay League&#x27;s Hiram Percy Maxim Memorial Station in Newington, Connecticut, is found in grid locator . Two points within the same Maidenhead subsquare are always less than apart, which means a Maidenhead locator can give adequate precision from only six easily transmissible characters.

For even more precise location mapping, two additional digits were proposed and ratified as an &quot;extended locator&quot;, making it altogether eight characters long, and dividing &quot;subsquares&quot; into even smaller ones with dimensions 15&quot; of latitude by 30&quot; of longitude. Such precision has uses in very short communication spans. Beyond this, no common definition exists to extend the system further into even smaller squares. Most often the extending is done by repeating alternating subsquare and square rules (base numbers 24 and 10 respectively). However, other bases for letter encodings have also been observed, and therefore such &quot;extended extended&quot; locators might not be compatible.

To summarise:
* Character pairs encode longitude first, and then latitude.
* The first pair (a &quot;field&quot;) encodes with base 18 and the letters &quot;A&quot; to &quot;R&quot;.
* The second pair (&quot;square&quot;) encodes with base 10 and the digits &quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot;.
* The third pair (&quot;subsquare&quot;) encodes with base 24 and the letters &quot;A&quot; to &quot;X&quot;.
* The fourth pair (&quot;extended square&quot;) encodes with base 10 and the digits &quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot;.

(The fifth and subsequent pairs are not formally defined, but recursing to the third and fourth pair algorithms is a possibility, e.g.: BL11BH16OO66)

On shortwave frequencies, positions are reported at &quot;square&quot; precision, and on VHF and UHF, &quot;subsquare&quot; precision is used. At high microwave frequencies &quot;extended square&quot; and &quot;extended subsquare&quot; precision is often used.

==Adoption and use==
Like the QRA system before it, Maidenhead locators were enthusiastically adopted by radio amateurs beyond contesting, and it is now in widespread use.

Maidenhead locators are still used as part of the formulas for scoring in many VHF amateur radio contests and as the basis of earning awards like the American Radio Relay League&#x27;s VHF/UHF Century Club, URE TTLOC, etc. operating contests.

Under IARU Region 1 rules, VHF distance calculations are carried out between Maidenhead subsquare centres, assuming a &quot;spherical&quot; Earth. This results in a small error in distance, but makes calculations simpler and, given the inherent imprecision in the input data used, it is not the biggest error source.
Until the adoption of WGS 84 as the official geodetic datum of the Maidenhead locator system in 1999, operators had usually specified their location based on their local national datum. Consequently, stations very near the edges of squares (at denoted precision) may have changed their locators when changing over to the use of WGS 84.

The relatively new FT8 narrowband digital mode transmits Maidenhead locator square as part of standard messages, with the 4 character locator square being efficiently represented within 15 bits of the transmitted string.

In 2019 the IARU clarified the latest position on use of the IARU locator at various levels of precision, including a fifth pair of characters and that all letters should be uppercase.

==Hardware and software support==
In 1985, the Radio Society of Great Britain published a small set of BASIC language routines to convert from locator references to geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for further processing. A complete program in BASIC called &quot;Universal Gridlocator&quot; was made available the following year by ARRL for a nominal cost of US$3.

Many other utilities exist to convert latitude and longitude to locators, as this is a favourite hack for programmers who are also radio amateurs. Perl supports conversion between geographical coordinates and Maidenhead locators in module Ham::Locator by Andy Smith, available on CPAN.

The Python maidenhead module is on pypi.org for installation via pip.

Many commercially available general purpose (civil) Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers (e.g. Garmin GPS-12) have the option to display positions in Maidenhead Locator format.

<doc id="505284" wikidata="Q2595" url="?curid=505284" title="Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)">
<text>Made in Japan is a double live album by English rock band Deep Purple, recorded during their first tour of Japan in August 1972. It was originally released on 8 December 1972 in Japan, with a US release on 30 March 1973, and became a critical and commercial success.

The band were well known for their strong stage act, and had privately recorded several shows, or broadcast them on radio, but were unenthusiastic about recording a live album until their Japanese record company decided it would be good for publicity. They insisted on supervising the live production, including using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band, as engineer, and were not particularly interested in the album&#x27;s release, even after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest and a positive response from fans.

The album was an immediate commercial success, particularly in the US, where it was accompanied by the top five hit &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, and became a steady seller throughout the 1970s. A three-CD set of most of the tour&#x27;s performances was released in 1993, while a remastered edition of the album with a CD of extra tracks was released in 1998. In 2014, a deluxe edition was announced with further bonus material. The album received a strong critical reception and continues to attract praise. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll in 2012 ranked &quot;Made in Japan&quot; the sixth best live album of all time.

== Background and live bootlegs ==
Deep Purple &quot;Mk II&quot; formed in July 1969 when founding members, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, organist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice, recruited singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover to progress from their earlier pop and psychedelic rock sound towards hard rock. They began touring extensively, becoming a well received live band, and had recorded several shows either to broadcast on the radio or listen to privately. However, they had rejected the idea of releasing a live album commercially as they believed it would be impossible to reproduce the quality and experience of their stage act on an LP.

Consequently, there was a demand for bootleg recordings of the band. The most notorious of these was an LP entitled &quot;H Bomb&quot;, recorded at Aachen on 11 July 1970, which led to a subsequent court case when Virgin Records&#x27; Richard Branson was prosecuted for selling it. An article in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that examined the bootleg phenomenon claimed that &quot;H Bomb&quot; was the best selling one at that time. This success, along with albums from other artists such as the Who&#x27;s &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya&#x27;s Out&quot; convinced the band that an official live album would be commercially successful. At the time, Glover told &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine that &quot;there are so many bootlegs of us going around, if we put out our own live set, it should kill their market.&quot;

== Tour and recording ==
By 1972, Deep Purple had achieved considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so it made sense to tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 May, though these were later changed to 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively due to an earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band&#x27;s label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album to be released in the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted if it was going to be released, they wanted it to be done properly. Gillan recalled, &quot;we said we would have to OK the equipment, we wanted to use our own engineer and we would have the last say on whether the tapes were released&quot;. The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.

The band&#x27;s live setlist had been revamped at the start of the year, immediately after recording the album &quot;Machine Head&quot;, and that album made up a substantial proportion of new material. Although the setlist remained the same for most of the year, opening with &quot;Highway Star&quot; and closing with &quot;Lazy&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin, the band&#x27;s musical skill and structure meant there was sufficient improvisation within the songs to keep things fresh. The original intention was the stage act would be used for about a year before being dropped, but Gillan and Glover both resigned from the band in June 1973. When this line-up reformed in 1984, the 1972 setlist made up a significant amount of material performed in concert.
The band arrived in Japan on 9 August, a week before the tour started, to a strong reception, and were greeted with gifts and flowers. Birch was not confident that the recording quality would be satisfactory, since the equipment supplied by Warner Bros. did not have any balance control and that the recorder&#x27;s size did not appear big enough on sight to capture a commercial quality recording. The band were uninterested in the result, concentrating on simply being able to deliver a good show. Subsequently, Lord noted that he felt this attitude meant the spontaneity of the performances and interplay between the band members was captured well.

The second gig in Osaka was considered to be the stronger of the two, and indeed this show made up the bulk of the released LP. Only one song, &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; from 15 August show was used, and this may simply have been because it was the only gig that Blackmore played the song&#x27;s opening riff as per the studio album.

The band considered the gig at Tokyo on 17 August to be the best of the tour. Glover remembered &quot;twelve or thirteen thousand Japanese kids were singing along to &#x27;Child in Time and considered it a career highlight, as did Gillan. At the venue, a row of bodyguards manned the front of the stage. When Blackmore smashed his guitar during the end of &quot;Space Truckin and threw it into the audience, several of them clambered past fans to try and retrieve it. Blackmore was annoyed, but the rest of the band found the incident amusing. The gig was not as well recorded as the Osaka shows, although &quot;The Mule&quot; and &quot;Lazy&quot; were considered of sufficient quality to make the final release.

There were no overdubs on the album. Lord claimed once in a magazine interview that a line from &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; had to be redubbed from a different show after Gillan had tripped over his microphone cable, but no direct evidence of this was found when the multitrack tapes were examined. According to Lord, the total budget for the recording was only $3,000 ().

== Release ==

The band did not consider the album to be important and only Glover and Paice showed up to mix it. According to Birch, Gillan and Blackmore have never heard the finished album. The band did not want the album to be released outside Japan and wanted full rights to the tapes, but it was released worldwide anyway.

The album was released in the UK in December 1972, with a special offer price of £3.25, the same as a typical single LP from that period. It reached number 16 in the charts. The cover was designed by Glover and featured a colour photo of the band on the front and rear covers, and black and white photos in the inside gatefold. The release in the US was delayed until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; first. They were motivated into releasing it due to a steady flow of UK imports being purchased, and it was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 6 in the charts. Warner Brothers also released &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; as a single, coupling the live recording on &quot;Made in Japan&quot; with the studio version on &quot;Machine Head&quot;, and it reached number 4 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. A recording of &quot;Black Night&quot; from the Tokyo gig, one of the encores that was not on the album, was released as the B-side to the single &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot; in Europe, and as a single in its own right in Japan.

The Japanese release was titled &quot;Live in Japan&quot; and featured a unique sleeve design, with an overhead stage shot of the band, a selection of photographs from a gig at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and an insert with lyrics and a hand-written message from each band member. The first pressing came with a 35mm film negative with photos of the band which buyers could develop into their own prints. The sleeve notes claimed that the recording only contained the Tokyo gig, though in fact it was musically identical to the version released in the rest of the world. Future Def Leppard guitarist Phil Collen was in the audience for the Rainbow gig as captured on the sleeve.

In Uruguay, the album was released in 1974 as a single LP (with just the first two sides) on Odeon Records. It used a simplistic sleeve design unlike any other release, with a rising sun on the cover.

==Reception==

The band had mixed feelings about the album. Gillan was critical of his own performance, yet impressed with the quality of the recording, while Lord listed it as his favourite Deep Purple album, saying, &quot;The band was at the height of its powers. That album was the epitome of what we stood for in those days.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s still probably the best live rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album ever made,&quot; declared Paice, who suggested that the shows were some of the group&#x27;s best. &quot;And that&#x27;s putting everything Led Zeppelin have done, anything Black Sabbath may have done, Bad Company, Free... As a &quot;tour de force&quot; of innovation and living on the edge and great playing with a fantastic sound, nothing comes close.&quot;

The response from critics was favourable. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Jon Tiven wrote that &quot;&quot;Made in Japan&quot; is Purple&#x27;s definitive metal monster, a spark-filled execution ... Deep Purple can still cut the mustard in concert&quot;. Subsequently, a 2012 readers&#x27; poll in the magazine declared the album to be the sixth best live album of all time, adding the band have performed &quot;countless shows since in countless permutations, but they&#x27;ve never sounded quite this perfect.&quot;

Recent reviews have been equally positive. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann considered the album to be &quot;a definitive treatment of the band&#x27;s catalog and its most impressive album&quot;. Rock author Daniel Bukszpan claimed the album is &quot;widely acknowledged as one of the greatest live albums of all time&quot;. &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine said the album &quot;defined Deep Purple even as it redefined the concept of the live album.&quot; Deep Purple author Dave Thompson wrote &quot;the standing of Deep Purple&#x27;s first (and finest) live album had scarcely diminished in the quarter-century since its release&quot;.

==Reissues==
The original LP was a steady seller throughout the 1970s and remained in print. The first reissue on CD was in 1988 which contained the complete double-LP on a single CD.

The 8-track tapes of the three shows were carefully put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album&#x27;s 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and archivist Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band&#x27;s management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including as much of the shows as possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled &quot;Live in Japan&quot;. This included all of the three main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.

Robinson subsequently oversaw a new reissue of the original album in 1998 on CD, that was also remastered by Mew. This version contained an extra CD with three tracks that had been left off the 1993 set. The colour scheme of the cover was reversed to show gold text on a black background. The remastered &quot;Made in Japan&quot; has further edits to make a contiguous performance, making it shorter than the original release. At the same time, a limited edition of 4,000 double LPs was released on purple vinyl, while in Spain, EMI added the studio versions of the tracks making up the original album to the second CD.

In 2014, Universal Music announced that the album would be reissued in a number of formats in May. The deluxe option is a set of four CDs or 9 LPs containing a new remix of the three concerts in full, a DVD containing previously unseen video footage, a hardback book and other memorabilia. The original LP was reissued in 180g vinyl as per the original release with the original 1972 mix, with the audio available for digital download through popular providers.

== Cover version ==
On 13 January 2006, progressive metal band Dream Theater played the original album in its entirety at Kokusai Forum in Tokyo, and also on the 15th at NHK Hall in Osaka. Both performances were recorded, and mixed by Glover. The latter of the two shows has been released through the band&#x27;s YtseJam Records label.

<text>Guerrilla News Network, Inc. (GNN) was a privately owned news website and television production company that operated from 2000 to 2009. It declared as its mission to &quot;expose people to important global issues through cross-platform guerrilla programming.&quot; This was accomplished through the production of original articles, reporting and multimedia, as well as republishing of commentary and news articles from a number of sources including other progressive commentary sites, mainstream news agencies, and blogs. GNN also hosted blogs for registered users, a discussion forum, featured collaborative user-driven investigations and user-submitted photo- and video journalism. The company also produced feature documentaries, books and music videos.

== History==

GNN was founded in 2000 by Josh Shore and Stephen Marshall. Their headquarters were in New York City and they had production facilities in Berkeley, California. GNN produced a series of award-winning short web films about such subjects as the CIA&#x27;s involvement in the drug trade during the 1980s and genetically engineered foods. They also produced two feature documentaries, numerous music videos, and a book. GNN&#x27;s website, GNN.tv, was user driven; users/contributors receive a free blog page. GNN allowed submissions of original content in the form of articles. These had to be wholly original, sourced, and accompanied by a photograph or illustration. GNN published submissions based on a voting system, where users/contributors who have had more publications on GNN have more voting weight. Submissions with enough votes were published to the front page, while everything else remained on its creator&#x27;s page until getting enough points. GNN also published headlines. The site was shut down in 2009, and the domain has since been occupied by a spam website.
