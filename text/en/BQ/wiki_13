<text>Glay (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese rock band formed in Hakodate in 1988. The core four members, vocalist Teru, guitarists Takuro and Hisashi, and bassist Jiro, have been together since 1992. Primarily composing songs in the rock and pop genres, they have also arranged songs using elements from a variety of other genres, including progressive rock, punk, gothic rock, electronic, R&amp;B, folk, gospel, reggae, and ska. Originally a visual kei band, the group slowly shifted to less dramatic attire through the years. With five million copies sold, Glay&#x27;s 1997 compilation album &quot;Review&quot; is the fifth best-selling album of all time in Japan. Their July 1999 concert &quot;Expo &#x27;99&quot; at Makuhari Messe was attended by 200,000 people, making it the largest-ticketed concert ever held by a single act at the time. As of 2008, Glay had sold an estimated 51 million records; 28 million singles and 23 million albums, making them one of the top ten best-selling artists of all time in Japan.

==History==

===1988–1994: Indies era===
Glay formed in 1988 as a high school band when Takuro asked Teru, a schoolmate, to play the drums. They found a bassist but had difficulty finding a vocalist. When Teru made a tape of his singing and gave it to Takuro he was immediately recruited for the part, leaving the drums part to be filled by another person. On the search for a second guitarist, Hisashi was asked to join but declined the offer, as he was already part of a locally well-known heavy punk/rock band called Ari, which better suited his taste in music. Hisashi eventually accepted Takuro&#x27;s offer and became Glay&#x27;s lead guitarist after Ari disbanded in 1989. Officially, the name &quot;Glay&quot; was coined by Takuro and is a deliberate misspelling of the word &quot;gray&quot; to represent the style of music they wanted to play: a mixture between rock (black) and pop (white). However, Hisashi confirmed in an interview with &quot;Natalie&quot; that the name came from Jun Gray, a member of the punk rock band Kenzi &amp; The Trips that he and Takuro had read about in the magazine &quot;Takarajima&quot;.

By the time of Takuro and Teru&#x27;s graduation, Glay were enjoying some popularity in their hometown of Hakodate and were playing full live houses. Following Hisashi&#x27;s high school graduation in 1990, the three moved to Tokyo to try to further expand their musical career. The bassist and the drummer chose to stay in Hakodate. In Tokyo, they found a completely different situation: although they had been relatively popular in their hometown, it was not easy to begin a career in Tokyo. Their concerts attracted few people, and sometimes none at all, and many live houses would not accept them because they did not fit well into either rock or pop categories. The band had to conciliate their music career to part-time jobs and faced financial problems during their first years in Tokyo.

During this time, members (particularly drummers) were constantly joining and leaving the band. When their bassist quit, Takuro knew that Jiro, who was also from Hakodate and had played with the indie band Pierrot (different from the now disbanded Pierrot, that enjoyed mainstream popularity), had moved to Tokyo and invited him to join Glay. He too, declined the offer, insisting that he was already heading in the right direction for himself. It wasn&#x27;t until Takuro asked him to play at just one show to fill in for their missing bassist that he decided to go. Following that show, Jiro continued to receive invitations to play with Glay, and eventually he became Glay&#x27;s official bass player, finalizing the official four member lineup in August 1992.

They promoted the band by handing out flyers on the street and giving out demo tapes. Eventually they became better known on the Tokyo live house circuit and began drawing larger crowds. Eventually, hide of X Japan gave one of Glay&#x27;s demos to his bandmate Yoshiki. During an October 1993 show, Yoshiki and his entourage came to watch and offered the band a contract to his record label Extasy Records. Their debut single, &quot;Rain&quot;, and their first album, &quot;Hai to Diamond&quot;, were both released on May 25, 1994.

===1995–2000: Record-setting success===
After the time of their debut, Glay steadily became more popular. Their 4th single &quot;Freeze My Love&quot; made it onto the Oricon Top 20, debuting at No. 19. Two months later their second album, &quot;Speed Pop&quot;, peaked at No. 8. It was their first album released on Platinum Records, a division of PolyGram that Yoshiki founded that same year. Their first No. 1 hit was in 1996 with their third album &quot;Beat Out!&quot;, which was marked as a major turning point in Glay&#x27;s career. Released later that same year, the fourth album &quot;Beloved&quot; was their first album to sell over 1 million copies. In September 1996, Glay played the final concert of the Beat Out! Reprise Tour at Nippon Budokan, their first concert at the venue, which is stated by them to have been their biggest dream coming true. In August 1997, their 12th single &quot;However&quot; remained at the top of the charts for two weeks in a row and, after it was displaced by Zard&#x27;s single &quot;Eien&quot; for one week, it re-appeared at the top position for another three weeks.

In the period between 1997 and 2000, Glay produced six million-selling singles, being the third artist with most million-selling singles of all time. Their 13th single &quot;Yuuwaku&quot; topped Oricon yearly single ranking in 1998. In 1999, their 16th single &quot;Winter, Again&quot; was number two of the year and won the 41st Japan Record Awards &quot;Grand Prix&quot; award, which is considered the most important Japanese music award. Their albums were also massively successful; both &quot;Pure Soul&quot; (1998) and &quot;Heavy Gauge&quot; (1999), along with the compilation album &quot;&quot; (2000), sold more than two million copies each.

The impact of their popularity was such that, in 1998, Japan&#x27;s telephone service was temporarily put out of order due to the mass number of fans trying to reserve tickets to their upcoming tour. The 1998 Winter Olympics were being held, and press coverage of the event became chaotic because of the incident.

In this period, the band won several prizes and established records. In 1997, their compilation album &quot;Review - Best of Glay&quot; stayed for five weeks in a row at the top position of the Oricon chart and became the all-time best-selling album in Japan at the time, with almost 5 million copies sold. Their 1999 video &quot;Survival&quot; sold approximately 900,000 copies and is the all-time best-selling video/DVD. In the same year, their first &quot;Expo&quot; concert would lure a record audience of 200,000 people (see &quot;Glay Expos&quot; below).
1999 was the year Glay played their first dome tour, Glay Dome Tour &quot;pure soul&quot; 1999, which made the band the first to hold a consecutive 5 day &quot;dome&quot; concert. This tour had a total of 15 performances in four venues and attracted a total audience of 750,000 people. Glay closed the year of 1999, playing the concert The Millennium Eve - A Christmas Present for the People Who Love Live a Lot, a joint concert with Luna Sea, on December 23, and the Glay Countdown Live in Messe &quot;Come Together&quot; concert on December 31.

Takuro described the &quot;Expo&#x27;99&quot; as a dream come true. When the album &quot;Heavy Gauge&quot; was released, in October 1999, Takuro wrote a diary entry in Glay&#x27;s official home page, describing the album as a representation of his feelings at that moment. His feelings were not of happiness, but of &quot;emptiness&quot; and not knowing what to do after &quot;doing everything&quot; they wanted to. The album is seen as a first step to a new direction in the band&#x27;s career. The band considered disbanding in 2000, after releasing their , which was a suggestion made by fellow singer Yuki Isoya, whose group Judy and Mary had disbanded.

===2001–2003===
After this period of massive success and a considerably steady style in their music, Glay&#x27;s work took a turn in 2001. Their 2001 album &quot;One Love&quot; got mixed feelings among the fans, due to its disparities to their earlier works, with a different, generally poppier and experimental sound, and songs that had reggae and R&amp;B influences. Their 2002 album &quot;Unity Roots and Family, Away&quot;, which was almost completely made of slow-paced songs and also had elements from other types of music (gospel, rap and traditional Okinawan music), was not welcomed by most fans.

In spite of the &quot;cold&quot; reception these works had, the band reached No. 1 spot in the charts with both albums. Glay continued being successful with their tours in Japan. They proved to enjoy popularity outside Japan as well, in 2001, when members visited Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea to promote the Expo 2001 &quot;Global Communication&quot; and officially invited artists Dome, Nicholas Tse, Mayday and Jaurim to participate in one of the Expo concerts. The next year, they played outside Japan for the first time (not counting one concert in Hawaii for their fanclub members), when they played a sold-out live performance for a 35,000 audience in Beijing. The concert is the most expensive in China&#x27;s history. Glay also met then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin.

In 2003, they made a contract transfer from Pony Canyon to Toshiba EMI, the most expensive transfer in Japan&#x27;s history, at 4 billion yen. Under the new company, Glay released their first DVD—single &quot;Itsuka&quot; and their first B-Side compilation albums, &quot;Rare Collectives Vol.1&quot; and &quot;Rare Collectives Vol. 2&quot;.

Also in 2003, an art gallery dedicated to Glay was opened in their hometown, Hakodate. &quot;Art Style of Glay&quot; was located in the Winning Hall, a famous building in the city and remained open until 2007.

===2004: 10th Anniversary===
In 2004, Glay had several activities to celebrate their 10th anniversary since their major debut. As a start to this celebration, Glay presented the concert Rock Shock vol. 3 in 2003. The name was taken from an indie festival organized by Glay in 1989, which had had two editions. In March of that year, they released their 9th studio album, &quot;The Frustrated&quot;, and in order to promote the album, the band held the Glay Concert Tour 2004 X-Rated and later, in October, the Glay Arena Tour 2004 &quot;The Frustrated&quot; -Extreme-.

On July 27 they played a &quot;pre-Expo&quot; concert at Universal Studios Japan and on July 31, they played the third edition of the Glay Expo, which was the main event of the year by the band. At the end of the year, they held the fan-club exclusive Countdown Live in Messe &quot;Come Together&quot; on December 31. They finished the 10th anniversary celebration with the release of the compilation &quot;Ballad Best Singles: White Road&quot; in January 2005 and with the 10th Anniversary Year Final Glay Dome Tour 2005 &quot;White Road&quot; which finished with the Glay 10th Anniversary Year Final Glay Osaka 4 Days Special 2005 &quot;White Road&quot;.

===2005–2006: Rebirth===
In 2005, after years of touring, promoting, and recording, the four took a hiatus. Their only new release as a group was the single &quot;Scream&quot;, their first collaboration work, with the vocal–dance group Exile. &quot;Scream&quot;, which was released under Exile&#x27;s record company, was the fifth bestselling single of the year.

During that time, Jiro created a side band with the pillows guitarist Sawao Yamanaka and Straightener&#x27;s drummer Nakayama Shinpei called The Predators, in the summer of 2005. The Predators played in summer festivals and released the mini-album &quot;Hunting!&quot;. Teru and Hisashi formed a band called Rally with The Mad Capsule Markets drummer Motokatsu and bassist Koji Ueno from Thee Michelle Gun Elephant. Rally contributed a cover of Buck-Tick&#x27;s &quot;Aku no Hana&quot; for the tribute CD &quot;Parade -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick-&quot;.

Although it was believed that Glay took a break as a group to take a rest, it was later reported in the news that the band had split from their former agency, Unlimited Group. The reasons were obscure, but the event managed to delay the band&#x27;s work. The band refers to it as a time when they &quot;couldn&#x27;t move forward&quot; and &quot;had thoughts of quitting&quot;. &quot;Cyzo&quot; magazine&#x27;s October 2005 issue had reported Glay&#x27;s management dispute and referred to it as a media taboo.
In February 2006, Glay ended their silence by having a two-day live performance in Zepp Tokyo and a three-day live performance at Nippon Budokan, titled Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle, which was produced as an independent event. Here, they played many of their old songs and introduced two new written songs as their new sound. It was the start of a campaign called &quot;Re-Birth&quot; to promote the band&#x27;s return to the music scene. Posters of their &quot;dead&quot; faces were displayed around the city of Tokyo and a movie of the &quot;old&quot; Glay burial by the &quot;new&quot; Glay was shown on television during the commercial breaks. Takuro founded his own office, called Lover Soul, but the band signed with Amuse, the office of Southern All Stars&#x27;s Keisuke Kuwata, in 2006 until the new office was established.

On July 12, 2006, they released a new single titled &quot;G4&quot; after a year and seven months away from the limelight, returning to their rock and roll roots. In the following month, they collaborated with former Boowy vocalist Kyosuke Himuro in their single &quot;Answer&quot;. Together, they performed &quot;Answer&quot; in Kyosuke Himuro + Glay Swing Addiction 2006. In August, Glay performed at Southern All Stars&#x27;s summer concert Mujintou alongside various artists. In September, &quot;Natsuoto/Henna Yume -Thousand Dreams-&quot; was released, with &quot;Natsuoto&quot; being the theme song to TV show &quot;Koi suru Hanikami&quot;.

Following the release of these singles was their tour, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle -Re-Birth- from November 2006 to early 2007.

===2007–2008===
On January 31, 2007, Glay released their tenth full-length studio album, &quot;Love is Beautiful&quot;, containing 14 tracks, which reached No. 1 spot and was their 10th album to do so, Until then, Glay had been the all-male band with most No. 1 albums in Japan, but later that year Mr. Children would replace them. Following the release of this album, the band began an arena tour, titled after the album.

Although there was not much to promote, Glay was very active as a live band. Over the summer of 2007, they performed at the 15th Anniversary Cue Music Jam-Boree in Yubari on July 1 and produced the &quot;Rock Shock. Vol. 4&quot; on August 23, 2007. They revived the side projects: Jiro&#x27;s band, The Predators, performed at the Rising Sun Rock Festival in Ezo on August 17 and 18 while Teru and Hisashi&#x27;s side band, Rally, performed at the &quot;Buck-Tick Fest 2007&quot; in September. Glay also performed the Highcommunications Tour 2007-2008 from November 2007 to March 2008.

As of 2008, the band continued the series of shows with the concerts Rock Shock vol. 5, in Zepp Fukuoka, on April 19 and AP Bank Fes &#x27;08 on July 19 and 20. In August, they performed for the first time in the United States. The Verb tour 2008 in U.S. was held at The Fillmore, in San Francisco, on August 12, and at the House of Blues, in Los Angeles, on August 15 and 16, 2008.

On September 21, the band appeared in a concert by Kyosuke Himuro held in Hokkaido. In December, the band continued their Glay Verb Tour in Japan, with four concerts in Zepp Sendai, Zepp Osaka, Zepp Nagoya, and Zepp Tokyo for their fan-club members. On December 30 and 31 they played the Glay Verb Tour Final &quot;Come Together&quot; 2008–2009, the third edition of their year-end countdown concerts.

===2009: 15th anniversary===
In 2009, Glay celebrated 15 years since the release of their debut single &quot;Rain&quot;. In January 2009, the band announced several concert tours during the year and two special concerts at the Nissan Stadium in August.

The first commemorative release was the 6 track single &quot;Say Your Dream&quot; on March 4, 2009. The title song is 13 minutes long and is reported to be a song about Glay&#x27;s history. Takuro reported that he approached this song as the message he would like to leave if he were to die, and that it took seven years to be completed. The promotional video was divided into two parts, the first of them started broadcasting on TV channels five days before the release of the single. The second part remains accessible on internet only through a pass code obtained with the limited edition of the single. On the same premium site, there is a PV of the coupling song &quot;Haru made wa&quot;. The single finishes Glay&#x27;s series of western song covers with &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; by the band The Offspring.

During April, the band held five concerts produced by the members, titled Glay Member Produced Live 2009 - The Great Vacation- Extra-. On April 8 and 9, the band played two concerts for official fanclub &quot;Happy Swing&quot; members who also have been affiliated with the fanclub for over 10 years at NHK Hall. The concerts were produced by Takuro. Teru produced another edition of the &quot;men only night&quot; concert (as he had done in 1999), which was held on April 13 at Studio Coast. Jiro produced a &quot;pair only&quot; concert, which was played on April 15 at the Osaka Hall, and, on April 17, Hisashi produced Resonance Vol. 2, which was broadcast by Yahoo!douga.

On May 25, 2009, the day Glay completed 15 years since their debut, the band released the single &quot;I am XXX&quot;. The song was used as the main theme for the movie &quot;&quot; around Asia, chosen by producer Bill Kong. On June 10, 2009, Glay released the greatest hits collection &quot;The Great Vacation Vol. 1 - Super Best of Glay&quot;, a triple CD containing most of their singles released after 2000, and a re-recorded version of 1998&#x27;s &quot;Yuuwaku&quot; in the 2 first CDs, while the third CD was mostly composed of unreleased songs.

On October 21, 2009, Glay released the second part of their greatest hits collection &quot;The Great Vacation Vol. 2 - Super Best of Glay&quot;, another triple CD containing hit singles from 1994 to 2000 and re-recorded versions of &quot;Acid Head&quot;, &quot;Shutter Speeds no Teema&quot; and &quot;Burst&quot;, as well as a remastering of older tracks. The third disc was another collection of unreleased songs.

On October 22, 2009, a Tokyo court ruled in favor of Glay over the ownership of 147 songs and ordered Unlimited Records to pay them 670 million yen for back royalties and unpaid contract fees. This was the issue that started in 2005 wherein royalties to Glay have ceased to be provided, leading the four-man band to seek termination of their contract with the company.

=== 2010–2013: Loversoul Music &amp; Associates ===
On April 1, 2010, Glay released &quot;Apologize&quot;, a free digital single that, according to Takuro, was a signal of gratitude to the fans.

Glay occasionally holds an exposition and concert called Glay Expo, which is always expensively produced and lures greater audiences than their normal stadium concerts. The first edition of the event was held on July 31, 1999. The Glay Expo &#x27;99 Survival, held in the parking lot of Makuhari Messe, gathered a total audience of 200,000 people, making it the largest-ticketed concert ever held by a single act, certified by Guinness World Records.

The second edition was held in 2001. Glay Expo 2001 &quot;Global Communication&quot; was divided into four performances: two in Tokyo, one in Ishikari, and an all-night long performance in Fukuoka, which featured artists; Dome from Thailand, Nicholas Tse from Hong Kong, Mayday from Taiwan, Jaurim from South Korea, and The D.e.p., a group formed by Glay&#x27;s producer Masahide Sakuma, Taiwanese singer Vivian Hsu, Gota Yashiki, Masami Tsuchiya and Mick Karn. These concerts accumulated a total audience of over 280,000. The concert in Ishikari had part of its fuel generated from solar and aeolic energy generating devices displayed in a booth.

July 2004 had three Glay Expo 2004 in &quot;The Frustrated&quot; shows. The latter two celebrating their 10th anniversary were held in the parking lot of Universal Studios Japan and sold out the 100,000 tickets in under 15 minutes. 2014 had two Glay Expos in September, the second celebrated the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary and brought 55,000 fans to Miyagi Stadium.

==Media exposure and works outside music==
Glay has appeared on several TV programs and front covers of many famous music magazines in Japan, such as &quot;Gigs&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s In?&quot;, &quot;BPass&quot;, &quot;Ongaku to Hito&quot;, &quot;PatiPati&quot;, &quot;Newsmaker&quot;, etc. Kadokawa Shoten has also produced two &quot;Glay only&quot; special edition books.

They have starred in several campaigns for various products, as clothes, chocolate, and Mini Discs. To promote the &quot;Expo &#x27;99&quot;, at the peak of their mainstream popularity, they had their faces printed on the sides of Japan Airlines jumbo jets, the sponsor of the event. The campaign was also a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Tokyo-Hakodate route. In 2002, they starred another campaign for Japan Airlines, promoting travel between Japan and China.

Each member of Glay, except Teru, has written a book (Jiro has written two and Takuro, three). In 2001, as a part of their &quot;Expo 2001&quot; preparation, they presented the TV show &quot;Glay Global Communication&quot;. Besides appearing in magazines and on TV, all of them have participated in their own weekly radio shows. As of 2008, only Teru and Jiro keep their radio-shows (aired on BayFM and FM802, respectively). In January 2009, Hisashi started his first TV regular segment &quot;RX-72 -Hisashi (Glay) VS Junichi Mogi-&quot;, every last Monday of each month on the Music-On TV channel. Takuro has also started a web radio-show, &quot;Takuro Mobile Meeting&quot;.

==Humanitarian and environmental works==
Besides performing in charity festivals as the &quot;Red Ribbon Live&quot; (in which Teru has participated since 2005), the &quot;White Band Fes&quot; in 2005, the &quot;Re-style Live&quot; (organized by the DJ Hisashi Yamada) and the &quot;AP Bank Fes&quot; in 2008, Glay, specially Teru and Takuro, have been actively participating in different causes.

In 2001, Takuro along with Ryuichi Sakamoto started &quot;Artists Power&quot;, an organization of artists who want to be active in the research on renewable energy. The two started talking about this project when they worked in Sakamoto&#x27;s charity project Zero Landmine and the first event linked to it was the Ishikari leg of the &quot;Glay Expo 2001&quot; (see &quot;Glay Expo&quot; above). AP Bank, which was founded by Mr. Children&#x27;s Kazutoshi Sakurai, composer Takeshi Kobayashi and Sakamoto, is linked to this organization; &quot;AP&quot; stands for both &quot;Artists Power&quot; and &quot;Alternative Power&quot;.

Teru has been engaged with the &quot;Red Ribbon Link Project&quot; since 2005 and has become an active spokesperson for the project. In 2008, he starred a HIV awareness campaign with posters and a commercial in which he had his own blood tested.

In 2011, after Eastern Japan was affected by the 9.0 magnitude Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Glay joined other artists in making donations for victim relief. The band donated 20 million yen to the &quot;Asahi Shimbun Social Welfare Organization&quot;. Takuro also made a donation of 10 million yen to &quot;Mudef&quot; (Music Design Foundation), an organization that aims at the accomplishment of all the United Nations Organization 8 MDGs (Millennium Development Goals) and seeks to help out people all over the world through music and arts. Takuro is also a board member along with singer Misia. Teru wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Thank You for Your Love&quot; to send a message of support to the victims and released it via Twitter. The song was re-recorded and was released as a download-only track with its profits donated to the Japanese Red Cross.

<doc id="489328" wikidata="Q702182" url="?curid=489328" title="City God (China)">
<text>A City God (), is a tutelary deity in Chinese folk religion who is believed to protect the people and the affairs of the particular village, town or city of great dimension, and the corresponding location in the afterlife. City God cults appeared over two millennia ago, and originally involved worship of a protective deity of a town&#x27;s walls and moats. Later, the term came to be applied to deified leaders from the town, who serve in authority over the souls of the deceased from that town, and intervene in the affairs of the living, in conjunction with other officials of the hierarchy of divine beings. City Gods are considered above &quot;tudigongs&quot; (&#x27;lords of local land&#x27;), which themselves are above landlord deities.

==Name==
In the name &quot;Chenghuangshen&quot; (), the first character &quot;cheng&quot; () means &quot;city wall&quot; (a &quot;defensive rampart&quot;; or, by extension, &quot;walled city&quot;) and the second character, &quot;huang&quot; (), literally means &quot;moat&quot;. &quot;Shen&quot; () means a god. Put together, Chenghuangshen was originally the name of a deity or type of deity believed to be able to provide divine protection to a city&#x27;s physical defenses, particularly its surrounding wall and moat. Later the concept became more generalized, and the meaning extended to the office itself of such a deity, rather than the presumed office-holder (in later times, it was standard to officially appoint the spirit of the government official in charge of the city to a three-year term as City God, upon his decease).

==History==


There are temples dedicated to the local City God in many cities of China. Much as the ancient Indians, the ancient Sumerians, and the ancient Greeks did, the Chinese traditionally believed that guardian gods watched over cities. Chenghuangshen are believed to be involved in communal concerns such as the need for rain, and may be involved in personal requests such as recovery from illness. Town residents may appeal to the City God for help in a natural disaster or other crisis. The City God may also be called upon to help those who are accused of crimes. The accused appear before the god and ask for a sign to help prove their innocence.

Usually, these patron gods are deified deceased officials. Chenghuangshen are believed to hold an important position in the imperial times it was often debated whether local gods such as the City God held more power than the local officials. There could also be a relation between the City God and the official. The official or magistrate would often turn to the Chenghuangshen for advice and help in governing the city.

Over time a large number of City God positions were created by official decrees, along with accompanying temples and images. Of these offices of City God, some might be a low ranking post in charge of a small village; others might be on the level of a whole province. In any case, by the nineteenth century the duties of the City God generally included accompanying three official processions per year and to perform certain administrative functions for the local spirits of the dead: on the 3rd day of the 3rd lunar month to let the ghost-spirits out of their winter quarters; on the 1st of the 7th month, to take census of the ghosts and ensure that they were fed; and on the biggest event of the three, the 1st of the 10th month, to gather together all the spirits, provide them all with winter clothing, and put them in their winter dwellings.

==Worship==

Chinese culture traditionally maintained a distinction between official religion and popular religion. In official religion, worship of the City God was according to the dictates of written legislation and was to be performed by officials and degree holders. The associated activities were designed to help legitimize the state in the eyes of the common people and preserve local social status distinctions. The prescribed sacrifices for a Chenghuangshen are described in the &quot;Auspicious Rites&quot; section of the &quot;Da Qing Tongli&quot;, the Qing dynasty manual for rituals. The official worship of a City God was a solemn and dignified event, with various ceremonies held inside the temples. The animals and food that were sacrificed to the Chenghuangshen were carefully inspected by the religious officials to make sure that they were good enough for the City God.

On the other hand, the City God was liable for punishment if he failed to perform his duties as requested: for example failure on his part to bring rain when properly asked could result in his sacred image being exposed to the burning rays of the sun, or being bodily whipped by the governor or magistrate.

The popular worship of a Chenghuangshen is much more flexible. People from both rural and urban areas come to pray to him or her, asking for specific favors. The most common favor requested in these prayers is good health. On the City God&#x27;s birthday the people of the town or city have a great celebration (&quot;miaohui&quot;) to honor the City God. These ceremonies often draw huge crowds of people and involve theatrical performances, sales of refreshments, fireworks, firecrackers, beating of gongs and drums, and incense burning.

==Hong Kong==

During the Qing dynasty, the emperor appointed a City God (Shing Wong) for all major cities in mainland China to govern and look after their land. Hong Kong had no appointed magistrate and therefore no protection of a Shing Wong.

In 1877 Hong Kong built their first Shing Wong temple, which was originally named &quot;Fook Tak Tsz&quot; (). It remains there today, at the junction of Shau Kei Wan Main Street East and Kam Wa Street, in Shau Kei Wan. It has undergone many updates and name changes. A new outer wall was built in 1974, giving the feeling of a temple within a temple. The temple is now officially called the Shing Wong Temple. The deities Tudigong (), Shing Wong, and Ng Tung () are enshrined in the temple.

There is some evidence that, prior to the building of the Fook Tak Tsz in Shau Kei Wan, there was a Shing Wong temple built at the junction of Shing Wong Street and Hollywood Road, where Queen&#x27;s College later stood. However, both buildings have been torn down. There are other temples located in Hong Kong that house the deity Shing Wong, such as the Man Mo Temple.

== People&#x27;s Republic of China ==
Chinese government officials have sponsored seminars at Cheng Huang temples across Fujian in an attempt to promote Chinese unification.

==Thailand==
In Thailand, Chenghuangshen is comparable to the &quot;Lak Mueang&quot; (city pillar) of Thai beliefs. He is often less known or worshiped as other guardian gods, such as Tudigong, Pun Tao Kong. His temples are few, such as in a small alley in Sampheng, part of Chinatown. Often his images are worshiped and enshrined with other deities in shrines or temples in different cities, such as Four Heavenly Kings in Wat Mangkon Kamalawat, etc.

<doc id="489331" wikidata="Q757970" url="?curid=489331" title="California State Route 85">
<text>State Route 85 (SR 85) is a state highway which connects the cities of southern San Jose and Mountain View in the U.S. State of California. The highway intersects with major highways such as I-280, SR 17, and SR 87. The route serves as a bypass of U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in the Santa Clara Valley area, running through the foothill cities of Los Gatos, Saratoga, Cupertino, roughly paralleling the Santa Cruz Mountains up to its interchange with I-280.

The highway is officially known as the West Valley Freeway along its entire length. A significant portion of the route is also signed as the Norman Y. Mineta Highway, after former San Jose Mayor, U.S. Congressman, Secretary of Commerce, and Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta. Its northernmost segment between I-280 and US 101, paralleling the Stevens Creek, also is known as the Stevens Creek Freeway.

SR 85 was built in two phases: the first, comprising the northern half, runs 5.7 miles from Stevens Creek Boulevard near Interstate 280 to its northern terminus at US 101 in Mountain View, was built in the 1960s. The second half, running 18.5 miles from US 101 in southern San Jose to Stevens Creek Boulevard in Cupertino, remained unbuilt until the 1980s and was opened in segments between 1991 and 1994. Prior to the construction of the freeway, the route was signed along Mathilda Avenue and De Anza Boulevard from US 101 near SR 237 southwards until its junction with SR 9 in Saratoga, which then served as its southern terminus until it was decommissioned the same day the freeway opened.

==Route description==

SR 85 begins at an interchange with US 101 and heads due west through San Jose. Near the Westfield Oakridge Mall in San Jose, SR 85 has an interchange with the southern terminus of the SR 87 freeway, which provides easy access to the San Jose International Airport. SR 85 continues west into Los Gatos, where it intersects the SR 17 freeway. SR 85 briefly enters Campbell and reenters San Jose before crossing into Saratoga. It turns northwest and briefly reenters San Jose before entering Cupertino and passing right next to De Anza College. SR 85 then interchanges with I-280 before briefly entering Sunnyvale and Los Altos and then entering Mountain View, where it first intersects SR 237 before terminating at US 101 near the Ames Research Center.

SR 85 has several points of interest. The northern terminus is located near Moffett Field, with its huge Hangar 1. Google&#x27;s main campus and Microsoft&#x27;s Silicon Valley Campus are located near the northern end of the freeway. Near the interchange with Interstate 280, SR 85 runs close to the headquarters of Apple Inc. and next to De Anza College as well as the same-named West Valley College, both community colleges in the area. Near interchange with SR 17, SR 85 runs next to the headquarters of Netflix in Los Gatos. VTA light rail runs in the median of SR 85 between the 85-87 interchange and its southern terminus as well as below it in Mountain View.

An infamous misconception for some commuters and businesses in San Jose, Campbell, and Los Gatos is that SR 85 (instead of I-280) serves as the northern terminus of SR 17 and the southern terminus of I-880. Although not planned, it is possible to truncate SR 17 further to SR 85 due to the segment meeting interstate standards as well as I-880 still terminating at its parent interstate, I-80, in Oakland.

This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2014, SR 85 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 58,000 at Bernal Road, and 129,500 at SR 87, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

===Truck ban===
The cities along the proposed route also pushed to prohibit trucks over from using SR 85 (similar to the I-580 truck ban in Oakland and SR 2 truck ban in Angeles National Forest). Thus, SR 85 became one of the handfuls of California freeways that do not allow such tractor semis. The restriction is legally in effect from SR 85&#x27;s southern terminus at U.S. Route 101 to Interstate 280 (exit 19B), although current signage permits southbound trucks to travel further to Stevens Creek Boulevard (exit 18). This ban has been a prime factor in reducing the level of noise that the freeway would otherwise produce as most large trucks are unable to use the freeway.

===HOV and Express lanes===
HOV or carpool lanes run along the entire length of SR 85. They require at least two people in a car on weekdays from 5-9 am and 3-7 pm, or a car with an &quot;Access OK&quot; sticker.

Caltrans is converting these existing HOV lanes to high-occupancy toll (HOT) or Express lanes. Construction of the express lanes started in fall 2020, with the first phase between the Central Expressway and SR 85&#x27;s northern terminus at US 101 opening on February 11, 2022. An extension south to SR 87 is scheduled for 2026. The city of Cupertino filed suit against Caltrans in May 2015 for failure to do a full Environmental Impact Report, and the project attracted overwhelmingly negative reception from the Sierra Club as well as the cities of Saratoga, Los Gatos, and Mountain View for a lack in efficient public transit and higher dependence on automobiles (similar to Los Angeles in the 1960s-1970s) and also criticized VTA at attempting to breach the original 1989 contract which reserved the median divider for mass transportation (presumably light rail).

, the HOT lanes&#x27; hours of operation is weekdays between 5:00 am and 8:00 pm; they are otherwise free and open to all vehicles at other times. Solo drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. Two-person carpools and clean air vehicles with a solo driver are charged 50 percent of the posted toll. Carpools with three or more people and motorcycles are not charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak &quot;Flex&quot; transponder with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants (1, 2, or 3+). Those with clean air vehicles need to apply for a special FasTrak &quot;CAV&quot; tag. Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.

==History==

===Preserving the right-of-way===
Land was set aside for the entire freeway in the 1950s, with maps first showing the proposed freeway in 1957. At the time, Santa Clara County still largely a rural area, consisting of orchards, and so the right-of-way touched very few existing structures. During Governor Jerry Brown&#x27;s tenure in the 1970s, the building of highways was de-emphasized in favor of mass transit, and some building was allowed on the right-of-way with the expectation that the freeway would never be built. Local government officials, however, fought to preserve the right-of-way and succeeded in doing so. As a result, when congestion on other freeways—I-280, US 101, and SR 17—intersecting this path became overwhelming, it was still possible for this freeway to be built with little demolition required.

In the interim, parts of the unused open space were leased for use without permanent structures, including a large tree nursery, a driving range, and among other things, overflow parking for De Anza College.

===Historic and original alignments===
State Route 9 originally extended from its current terminus to Mission San Jose along present-day SR 85, SR 237, I-680, SR 262, and SR 238. When the San Jose-Oakland US 101E designation was dropped in 1935, Route 5 between Mission San Jose (where the new SR 21 turned northeast) and Hayward did not retain a signed designation. Later SR 9 was extended north along SR 17 (which had replaced SR 13) from Milpitas to Warm Springs, SR 21 to Mission San Jose, and the independent section of former US 101E - all part of Route 5 - to US 50 (also Route 5, which included a branch to Oakland) near Hayward. Except for a short realignment in the mid-1950s onto Route 69 (now I-880 and SR 262) between Milpitas and Warm Springs, this alignment remained until the 1964 renumbering when SR 9 would eventually be truncated to its existing terminus in Los Gatos.

From 1963 to 1965, SR 85 was a 10-mile highway that entirely on surface streets from US 101 near SR 237 to I-280 along Mathilda Ave and Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road (a portion of which was later renamed De Anza Blvd) while the current freeway was being planned. The northern segment was rerouted in 1965 once the northern segment of the freeway opened. The southern segment was deleted in 1994 on the same day the remainder of the current freeway opened.

===Funding and planning===
The town of Los Gatos and city of Saratoga added to the complexity and cost of the planning and implementation; to avoid excessive noise, they insisted that the freeway be built below grade (at an eventual additional cost of US$60 million), that it have only three lanes in each direction: the leftmost lane being a HOV lane, and two lanes carrying standard traffic. In addition, to prevent what they felt would be excessive additional traffic on their surface streets, they lobbied heavily to prevent having any freeway entrances or exits in their cities. Full interchanges were originally planned at Winchester Boulevard, Quito Road, Saratoga Avenue, and Prospect Road; the final compromise placed only a half interchange at Winchester and completely did away with the Quito and Prospect interchanges. As a result, backups at entrances to the freeway near these cities are tremendous during morning rush hour, and Los Gatos and Campbell residents who want to take 85 southward must go two or three miles (3 to 5 km) out of their way to find a ramp onto the freeway.

The project was the first in the state for which county residents voted to tax themselves to build a state highway. Because state funds were scarce and congestion on other freeways and on surrounding surface streets was tremendous, a slight majority of voters (56%) voted for the tax in 1984. At the time, there was considerable controversy over whether funds would be better spent on mass transit and whether a freeway through so many residential areas would destroy the quality of life. The total US$785 million cost of the freeway was mostly funded by the special tax on county residents, along with matching state and federal funds. The project proved successful enough that, since then, many other locales have used local taxes to build state projects. It was also so effective as a solution to traffic problems that, several years after it was built, a poll by the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group revealed that nearly 80% of voters claimed that they had voted for the tax.

===Construction of the freeway===
The northern section, from Stevens Creek Boulevard in Cupertino to US 101 at Mountain View, was completed and opened on 8 December 1965 as four lanes (I-280 was not complete north of SR 85 up to SR 92 until a few years later so certain ramps remained closed until the 1970s). The northern section&#x27;s carpool lanes were completed in 1990 (south half) and 1998 (north half). In the southern section, partial fill for the interchanges at Blossom Hill Road and SR 87 was placed in 1986. Construction of the first structures (at the SR 85/87 and SR 85/Stevens Creek interchanges) broke ground on April 20, 1988. During the Loma Prieta Earthquake in 1989, these segments, along with the other segments under construction, were spared major damage despite being approximately 10 miles north of the epicenter. SR 85 opened between Santa Teresa Boulevard (at the future 85/87 interchange) and Cottle Road in 1991 with only 2 lanes in each direction, along with the light rail line in the median of SR 85. The extensions to Almaden Expressway and Great Oaks Boulevard were completed in 1992. With the completion of the southern leg (from I-280 to 85) of SR 87 in 1993, the 85/87 interchange opened to traffic that year (with only two connector ramps, from 85 north to 87 north and 87 south to 85 south, due to funding limitations). The HOV lanes were painted on this segment in April 1994. The remaining segments, from US 101 (in South San Jose) to Great Oaks and from Almaden Expressway to I-280, opened in August 1994 and October 1994 respectively. The projects completed in the 1990s had a total cost of about $785 million.

The remaining ramps at the SR 85/87 interchange (from 85 south to 87 north and 87 south to 85 north) were completed in 2003. Before these ramps were constructed, travelers had to use Santa Teresa Boulevard (which 87 turned into at its southern terminus) to join 85 north; similarly, travelers on 85 south had to exit at Santa Teresa Boulevard in order to access 87. At the southern SR 85/101 interchange in South San Jose, carpool-to-carpool ramps and the south 101 to north 85 connector ramp were opened in 2004. The $125 million reconstruction of the northern Highway 85/101 interchange in Mountain View, with the original ramps (opened in 1965) replaced and new carpool-to-carpool and other ramps added, was completed in 2006. The projects completed in the 2000s had a total cost of about $237 million.

When the SR 17/85 interchange was built in the early 1990s, Caltrans built a tunnel that was to carry traffic from north 17 to north 85, similar to the tunnel that carries traffic from south 17 to south 85. But due to insufficient funds, the second tunnel was sealed at both ends by the dirt embankment, with a loop ramp provided instead.

Unfortunately, large sections of the freeway had to be repainted prior to opening, due to graffiti. The segment from Santa Teresa Boulevard to US 101 in South San Jose was further repaved in 2011 (Northbound) and 2018 (Southbound).

Like most California urban freeways at the time it was built, SR 85 originally used a mix of nonreflective and reflective raised pavement markers (i.e., Botts dots and Stimsonite reflectors) to mark lanes. After California phased out Botts&#x27; dots (leaving Stimsonite reflectors as the only kind of raised pavement marker) and transitioned to wider lane stripes, the freeway was repainted to the new standard in late 2019 (similar to I-15 in Cajon Pass).

===Aftermath of the freeway===
In October 1994, the completed freeway between Almaden Expressway and I-280 opened with the &quot;Party on the Freeway&quot;, a single day on which only pedestrians and bicyclists were allowed to travel its length. The evening before opening day several cities along the route, including Saratoga and Campbell, held street fair events on the freeway featuring fine food, wine, and games. Limo service was offered linking the different cities&#x27; fairs, giving locals their first glimpse of the new freeway. The next morning 85 was officially opened to traffic. The city of Campbell had planted a large display of pansies spelling out the city&#x27;s name on the sloped side of the freeway bed; this caused a traffic jam as motorists slowed to read the message. The flowers were removed after the first day. The route has had a speed limit of 65 MPH since 1996.

The overall commute for people from south San Jose through Campbell into Mountain View and other business areas of Silicon Valley improved by roughly half an hour over previous longer routes on already crowded freeways or over miles of surface streets. Major surface streets that had once been unnavigable during many hours of the day suddenly became—and remained—usable. For example, eastern Blossom Hill Road had a typical load of 23,000 cars a day before 85 opened; as of 2004, a typical day&#x27;s load was a mere 11,000 cars. (Conversely, Saratoga Avenue, which previously had been a fairly quiet road, now sees about 18,000 cars a day because it is the only interchange in or near the city of Saratoga.)

As with any freeway, ambient noise in surrounding neighborhoods increased, from a steadily annoying whisper of sound day and night to a dull roar that muted backyard conversations. Property values, however, did not diminish; it is possible that the improved commute and access to the vast California freeway network improved the desirability of these neighborhoods. The noise level, however, has continued to be an issue with some residents, particularly in Saratoga. Caltrans has floated several options from repaving with asphalt, to grinding down the current concrete surface of the highway. An experimental length of the freeway from Cox Avenue to De Anza Boulevard was ground down in 2003. This smoothed out much of the top layer of the freeway removing most of the rain grooves that had been cut in the concrete when the highway was first built. The result did lower the ambient sound levels along that stretch of the freeway, and subsequently, the entire concrete surfaced section of the freeway from Almaden Expressway to Stevens Creek Boulevard was microgrooved in a follow-up project in 2005.

===Other unique features and events===
Besides the funding breakthrough, SR 85 set new standards in two additional areas: metering lights and median safety barriers.

SR 85 was the first freeway in California to open with metering lights at every onramp, including interchanges with SR 17 and US 101. When the freeway opened on October 19, 1994, the lights caused tremendous backups at the onramps during commute hours, raising an outcry from commuters furious at having to wait as much as 20 to 30 minutes in the worst cases before entering the freeway. The county required Caltrans to turn off the metering lights, which they did on November 17, 1994. This almost immediately slowed the commute over the full 24 mile (39 km) stretch by 33 minutes; Caltrans eventually turned the lights back on in 1995, which sped up the overall commute considerably.

In January 2009, several metering lights in the southern portion of SR 85 were reactivated. These included the SR 87-to-SR 85 interchange, the Almaden Expressway on-ramps, and the Blossom Hill Road on-ramps.

From 1994 to 1996, the speed limit on the freeway was 55 MPH. It was one of the first urban freeways to receive a 65 MPH speed limit in 1996.

The freeway was constructed with a 46-to-50-foot (14–15 m) wide center median. Initially, no barrier of any kind was installed in the median because, at the time, Caltrans regulations stated that any median wider than 45 feet (14 m) did not require a median barrier unless there was a history of head-on collisions. Public outcry convinced Caltrans to install the standard post-and-metal-beam barrier the entire length of the freeway and also to change their regulations so that median barriers are now required on all high-volume freeways with medians of less than 75 feet (23 m). Accidents and injuries dropped by roughly one-third in the first year after the barrier was installed.

In 1998, California Highway Patrol officer Scott Greenly was struck by a car and killed while issuing a ticket on the shoulder of Route 85; thereafter the portion between Quito Road and Prospect Road in the City of Saratoga was named the CHP Officer Scott M. Greenly Memorial Freeway. On September 15, 2008, the remainder of the freeway, north of Prospect Road as well as south of Quito Road, was named in honor of former San Jose mayor, congressman, and United States Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta.

<doc id="489334" wikidata="Q1860557" url="?curid=489334" title="Self-concept">
<text>In the psychology of self, one&#x27;s self-concept (also called self-construction, self-identity, self-perspective or self-structure) is a collection of beliefs about oneself. Generally, self-concept embodies the answer to the question &quot;&quot;Who am I?&quot;.&quot;

The self-concept is distinguishable from self-awareness, which is the extent to which self-knowledge is defined, consistent, and currently applicable to one&#x27;s attitudes and dispositions. Self-concept also differs from self-esteem: self-concept is a cognitive or descriptive component of one&#x27;s self (e.g. &quot;I am a fast runner&quot;), while self-esteem is evaluative and opinionated (e.g. &quot;I feel good about being a fast runner&quot;).

Self-concept is made up of one&#x27;s self-schemas, and interacts with self-esteem, self-knowledge, and the social self to form the self as a whole. It includes the past, present, and future selves, where future selves (or possible selves) represent individuals&#x27; ideas of what they might become, what they would like to become, or what they are afraid of becoming. Possible selves may function as incentives for certain behaviour.

The perception people have about their past or future selves relates to their perception of their current selves. The temporal self-appraisal theory argues that people have a tendency to maintain a positive self-evaluation by distancing themselves from their negative self and paying more attention to their positive one. In addition, people have a tendency to perceive the past self less favourably (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m better than I used to be&quot;) and the future self more positively (e.g. &quot;I will be better than I am now&quot;).

==History==
Psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow had major influence in popularizing the idea of self-concept in the West. According to Rogers, everyone strives to reach an &quot;ideal self.&quot; He believed that a person gets to self-actualize when they prove to themself that they are capable enough to achieve their goals and desires, but in order to attain their fullest potential, the person must have been raised in healthy surroundings which consist of &quot;genuineness, acceptance, and empathy&quot;, however, the lack of relationships with people that have healthy personalities will stop the person from growing &quot;like a tree without sunlight and water&quot; and affect the individual&#x27;s process to accomplish self- actualization. Rogers also hypothesized that psychologically healthy people actively move away from roles created by others&#x27; expectations, and instead look within themselves for validation. On the other hand, neurotic people have &quot;self-concepts that do not match their experiences. They are afraid to accept their own experiences as valid, so they distort them, either to protect themselves or to win approval from others.&quot;

According to Carl Rogers, the self-concept has three different components:
*The view one has of oneself (self-image)
*How much value one places on oneself (self-esteem or self-worth)
*What one wishes one were really like (ideal self)
Abraham Maslow applied his concept of self-actualization in his hierarchy of needs theory. In this theory, he explained the process it takes for a person to achieve self-actualization. He argues that for an individual to get to the &quot;higher level growth needs&quot;, he must first accomplish &quot;lower deficit needs&quot;. Once the &quot;deficiency needs&quot; have been achieved, the person&#x27;s goal is to accomplish the next step, which is the &quot;being needs&quot;. Maslow noticed that once individuals reach this level, they tend to &quot;grow as a person&quot; and reach self-actualization. However, individuals who experienced negative events while being in the lower deficit needs level prevents them from ascending in the hierarchy of needs.

The self-categorization theory developed by John Turner states that the self-concept consists of at least two &quot;levels&quot;: a personal identity and a social one. In other words, one&#x27;s self-evaluation relies on self-perceptions and how others perceive them. Self-concept can alternate rapidly between one&#x27;s personal and social identity. Children and adolescents begin integrating social identity into their own self-concept in elementary school by assessing their position among peers. By age five, acceptance from peers significantly affects children&#x27;s self-concept, affecting their behaviour and academic success.

==Model==

The self-concept is an internal model that uses self-assessments in order to define one&#x27;s self-schemas. Changes in self-concept can be measured by spontaneous self-report, where a person is prompted by a question like &quot;Who are you?&quot;. Often when measuring changes to the self-evaluation, whether a person has a positive or negative opinion of oneself, is measured instead of self-concept.

Features such as personality, skills and abilities, occupation and hobbies, physical characteristics, gender, etc. are assessed and applied to self-schemas, which are ideas of oneself in a particular dimension (e.g., someone that considers themselves a geek will associate &quot;geek-like&quot; qualities to themselves). A collection of self-schemas makes up one&#x27;s overall self-concept. For example, the statement &quot;I am lazy&quot; is a self-assessment that contributes to self-concept. Statements such as &quot;I am tired&quot;, however, would not be part of someone&#x27;s self-concept, since being tired is a temporary state and therefore cannot become a part of a self-schema. A person&#x27;s self-concept may change with time as reassessment occurs, which in extreme cases can lead to identity crises.

=== Parts ===
Various theories identify different parts of the self include:

* Self-image: the view one has of oneself
* Self-esteem: how much you value yourself 
* Ideal self: what you wish to be
* Social identity: the part of the self that is determined by members in social groups

==Development==

Researchers debate over when self-concept development begins. Some assert that gender stereotypes and expectations set by parents for their children affect children&#x27;s understanding of themselves by approximately age three. However, at this developmental stage, children have a very broad sense of self; typically, they use words such as big or nice to describe themselves to others. While this represents the beginnings of self-concept, others suggest that self-concept develops later, in middle childhood, alongside the development of self-control. At this point, children are developmentally prepared to interpret their own feelings and abilities, as well as receive and consider feedback from peers, teachers, and family. In adolescence, the self-concept undergoes a significant time of change. Generally, self-concept changes more gradually, and instead, existing concepts are refined and solidified. However, the development of self-concept during adolescence shows a U-shaped curve, in which general self-concept decreases in early adolescence, followed by an increase in later adolescence.

Romantic relationships can affect people&#x27;s self-concept throughout a relationship. Self-expansion describes the addition of information to an individual&#x27;s concept of self. Self-expansion can occur during relationships. Expansion of self-concept can occur during relationships, during new challenging experiences.

Additionally, teens begin to evaluate their abilities on a continuum, as opposed to the &quot;yes/no&quot; evaluation of children. For example, while children might evaluate themselves &quot;smart&quot;, teens might evaluate themselves as &quot;not the smartest, but smarter than average.&quot; Despite differing opinions about the onset of self-concept development, researchers agree on the importance of one&#x27;s self-concept, which influences people&#x27;s behaviors and cognitive and emotional outcomes including (but not limited to) academic achievement, levels of happiness, anxiety, social integration, self-esteem, and life-satisfaction.

===Academic===
Academic self-concept refers to the personal beliefs about their academic abilities or skills. Some research suggests that it begins developing from ages three to five due to influence from parents and early educators. By age ten or eleven, children assess their academic abilities by comparing themselves to their peers. These social comparisons are also referred to as &quot;self-estimates&quot;. Self-estimates of cognitive ability are most accurate when evaluating subjects that deal with numbers, such as math. Self-estimates were more likely to be poor in other areas, such as reasoning speed.

Some researchers suggest that to raise academic self-concept, parents and teachers need to provide children with specific feedback that focuses on their particular skills or abilities. Others also state that learning opportunities should be conducted in groups (both mixed-ability and like-ability) that downplay social comparison, as too much of either type of grouping can have adverse effects on children&#x27;s academic self-concept and the way they view themselves in relation to their peers.

===Physical===
Physical self-concept is the individual&#x27;s perception of themselves in areas of physical ability and appearance. Physical ability includes concepts such as physical strength and endurance, while appearance refers to attractiveness and body image. Adolescents experience significant changes in general physical self-concept at the onset of puberty, about eleven years old for girls and about 15 years old for boys. The bodily changes during puberty, in conjunction with the various psychological changes of this period, makes adolescence especially significant for the development of physical self-concept. An important factor of physical self-concept development is participation in physical activities. It has even been suggested that adolescent involvement in competitive sports increases physical self-concept.

===Gender identity===

A person&#x27;s gender identity is a sense of one&#x27;s own gender. These ideas typically form in young children. According to the International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family, gender identity is developed at an early age when the child starts to communicate; by the age of eighteen months to two years is when the child begins to identify as a girl or a boy. After this stage, some consider gender identity already formed, although some consider non-gendered identities more salient during that young of an age. Kohlberg noted gender constancy occurs by the ages of five to six, a child becomes well-aware of their gender identity. Both biological and social factors may influence identities such as a sense of individuality, identities of place as well as gendered identities. As part of environmental attitudes, some suggest women more than men care about the environment. Forms of gender stereotyping is also important to consider in clinical settings. For example, a study at Kuwait University with a small sample of 102 individuals with gender dysphoria examined self-concept, masculinity and femininity. Findings were that children who grew up on lower family bonds had lower self-concept. Clearly, it is important to consider the context of social and political attitudes and beliefs before drawing any conclusions about gender identities in relation to personality, particularly about mental health and issues around acceptable behaviours.

== Measures ==
Since self-concept concerns one&#x27;s awareness and perception of the external judgment from their social environment and the internal attributes of the self, self-reported questionnaires have been the most widely adopted measure for assessing self-concept. Many of the existing questionnaires in the academia do not differentiate between the assessment of self-concept and self-esteem. The most commonly used questionnaires include the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory for Adults, the Adolescent Coping Scale (ACS) by Frydenberg and Lewis, as well as the Harter’s Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents.

=== The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) ===
The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale is a two-dimensional scale developed in 1965 by Morris Rosenberg, originally designed for measuring the self-esteem of adolescents, but has gained wider use in other populations, such as adults. This inventory comprises ten Likert scale items that assess one&#x27;s level of self-confidence (or personal satisfaction) and self-contempt (or personal devaluation). With each item scaling from 1 to 4 points, a total of 30 points or above indicates a positive self-esteem/self-concept, 26-29 points indicating an intermediate self-esteem/self-concept, and those who get 25 points or below will be considered as having low self-esteem/self-concept.

=== The Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (CSEI) ===
The Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory is a self-report questionnaire developed in 1981 to measure attitudes toward the self among children, adolescents and adults. The inventory comes in three forms: School Form (ages 8-15 years), Adult Form (ages 16 and above) and Short Form. Originally, the inventory was aimed at children in school (8-15 years) but later on, a revised version where 17 of the 58 items were rephrased to use with adults. The most commonly used version is the Adult Form. The inventory comprises 50 items and yields a total score alongside four separate scores which represent more specific aspects of self-esteem. These aspects include: general self, social self-peers, home parents and school academic. With each item scored using a dichotomous scale, scores rage from 0 to 50, with higher scores reflecting higher self-esteem.

=== The Adolescent Coping Scale (ACS) ===
The Adolescent Coping Scale (ACS) is an 80-item questionnaire developed in 1997 by Erica Frydenberg and Ramon Lewis. The aim of the questionnaire is to measure adolescent coping strategies on a 5-point Likert scale. The ACS uses a self-report approach to subcategorize 79 items into 18 common coping mechanisms, which are then grouped into three broad coping styles: coping in relation to others, productive coping, and non-productive coping. Examples of coping in relation to others include seeking professional help, social action, and social and spiritual support. Productive coping behaviours include focusing on the positive, finding solutions to the problem, and physical recreation, while non-productive mechanisms involve worrying, self blame, and wishful thinking. The final item, question 80, is an open-ended question that qualitatively assesses other mechanisms adolescents use to cope during difficult circumstances. The Adolescent Coping Scale gives respondents insight into their self concept by giving them an opportunity to engage in self-assessment and reflect on their behaviours and how they respond to a given situation.

=== Harter&#x27;s Self Perception Profile for Adolescents ===
The Self Perception Profile for Adolescents was developed by Susan Harter in 1988, comprising of nine sub-scales that each have five items. The measure assesses adolescents&#x27; perception of the self from nine aspects of their life, as listed below: physical appearance, romantic appeal, close friendship, social competence, behavioural conduct, scholastic competence, job competence, athletic competence, global self-worth. During the administration of the test, adolescents will choose one sub-scale and indicate their perceived competence in the particular aspect. Each item in the sub-scale scores from 1 (low perceived competence) to 4 (high perceived competence).

== Motivational properties ==
Self-concept can have motivational properties. There are four types of motives in particular that are most related to self-concept:

* Self-assessment: desire to receive information about the self that is accurate
* Self-enhancement: desire to receive feedback that informs the self of positive or desirable characteristics
* Self-verification: desire to confirm what one already knows about the self
* Self-improvement: desire to learn things that will help to improve the self

Some of these motives may be more prominent depending on the situation. In Western societies, the most automatic is the self-enhancement motive, and may be dominant in some situations where motives contradict one another. For example, the self-enhancement motive may contradict and dominate the self-assessment motive if one seeks out inaccurate compliments rather than honest feedback. Additionally, self-concept can motivate behavior because people tend to act in ways that reaffirm their self-concept, which is consistent with the idea of the self-verification motive. In particular, if people perceive the self a certain way and receive feedback contrary to this perception, a tension is produced that motivates them to reestablish consistency between environmental feedback and self-concept. For example, if someone believes herself to be outgoing, but someone tells her she is shy, she may be motivated to avoid that person or the environment in which she met that person because it is inconsistent with her self-concept of being an outgoing person. Further, another major motivational property of self-concept comes from the desire to eliminate the discrepancy between one&#x27;s current self-concept and his or her ideal possible self. This is parallel with the idea of the self-improvement motive. For example, if one&#x27;s current self-concept is that she is a novice at piano playing, though she wants to become a concert pianist, this discrepancy will generate motivation to engage in behaviors (like practicing playing piano) that will bring her closer to her ideal possible self (being a concert pianist).

==Cultural differences==
Worldviews about one&#x27;s self in relation to others differ across and within cultures. Western cultures place particular importance on personal independence and on the expression of one&#x27;s own attributes (i.e. the self is more important than the group). This is not to say those in an independent culture do not identify and support their society or culture, there is simply a different type of relationship. Non-Western cultures favor an interdependent view of the self: Interpersonal relationships are more important than one&#x27;s individual accomplishments, and individuals experience a sense of oneness with the group. Such &quot;identity fusion&quot; can have positive and negative consequences. Identity fusion can give people the sense that their existence is meaningful provided the person feels included within the society (for example, in Japan, the definition of the word for self () roughly translates to &quot;one&#x27;s share of the shared life space&quot;). Identity fusion can also harm one&#x27;s self-concept because one&#x27;s behaviors and thoughts must be able to change to continue to align with those of the overall group. Non-interdependent self-concepts can also differ between cultural traditions.

Additionally, one&#x27;s social norms and cultural identities have a large effect on self-concept and mental well-being. When a person can clearly define their culture&#x27;s norms and how those play a part in their life, that person is more likely to have a positive self-identity, leading to better self-concept and psychological welfare. One example of this is in regards to consistency. One of the social norms within a Western, independent culture is consistency, which allows each person to maintain their self-concept over time. The social norm in a non-Western, interdependent culture has a larger focus on one&#x27;s ability to be flexible and to change as the group and environment change. If this social norm is not followed in either culture, this can lead to a disconnection with one&#x27;s social identity, which affects personality, behavior, and overall self-concept. Buddhists emphasize the impermanence of any self-concept.

Anit Somech, an organizational psychologist and professor, who carried a small study in Israel showed that the divide between independent and interdependent self-concepts exists &quot;within&quot; cultures as well. Researchers compared mid-level merchants in an urban community with those in a kibbutz (collective community). The managers from the urban community followed the independent culture. When asked to describe themselves, they primarily used descriptions of their own personal traits without comparison to others within their group. When the independent, urban managers gave interdependent-type responses, most were focused on work or school, due to these being the two biggest groups identified within an independent culture. The kibbutz managers followed the interdependent culture. They used hobbies and preferences to describe their traits, which is more frequently seen in interdependent cultures as these serve as a means of comparison with others in their society. There was also a large focus on residence, lending to the fact they share resources and living space with the others from the kibbutz. These types of differences were also seen in a study done with Swedish and Japanese adolescents. Typically, these would both be considered non-Western cultures, but the Swedish showed more independent traits, while the Japanese followed the expected interdependent traits.

Along with viewing one&#x27;s identity as part of a group, another factor that coincides with self-concept is stereotype threat. Many working names have been used for this term: &quot;stigmatization&quot;, &quot;stigma pressure&quot;, &quot;stigma vulnerability&quot; and &quot;stereotype vulnerability&quot;. The terminology that was settled upon Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson to describe this &quot;situational predicament was &#x27;stereotype threat.&#x27; This term captures the idea of a situational predicament as a contingency of their [marginalized] group identity, a real threat of judgment or treatment in the person&#x27;s environment that went beyond any limitations within.&quot; Steele and Aronson described the idea of stereotype threat in their study of how this socio‐psychological notion affected the intellectual performance of African Americans. Steele and Aronson tested a hypothesis by administering a diagnostic exam between two different groups: African American and White students. For one group a stereotype threat was introduced while the other served as a control. The findings were that academic performance of the African American students was significantly lower than their White counterparts when a stereotype threat was perceived after controlling for intellectual ability. Since the inception by Steele and Aronson of stereotype threat, other research has demonstrated the applicability of this idea to other groups.

When one&#x27;s actions could negatively influence general assumptions of a stereotype, those actions are consciously emphasized. Instead of one&#x27;s individual characteristics, one&#x27;s categorization into a social group is what society views objectively – which could be perceived as a negative stereotype, thus creating a threat. &quot;The notion that stereotypes held about a particular group may create psychologically threatening situations associated with fears of confirming judgment about one&#x27;s group, and in turn, inhibit learning and performance.&quot;

The presence of stereotype threat perpetuates a &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; that further marginalized minority groups. Hidden curriculum refers to a covert expression of prejudice where one standard is accepted as the &quot;set and right way to do things&quot;. More specifically, the hidden curriculum is an unintended transmission of social constructs that operate in the social environment of an educational setting or classroom. In the United States&#x27; educational system, this caters to dominant culture groups in American society.&quot;A primary source of stereotyping is often the teachers education program itself. It is in these programs that teachers learn that poor students and students of color should be expected to achieve less than their &#x27;mainstream&#x27; counterparts.&quot; These child-deficit assumptions that are built into the program that instructs teachers and lead to inadvertently testing all students on a &quot;mainstream&quot; standard that is not necessarily academic and that does not account for the social values and norms of non-&quot;mainstream&quot; students.

For example, the model of &quot;teacher as the formal authority&quot; is the orthodox teaching role that has been perpetuated for many years until the 21st-century teaching model landed on the scene. As part of the 5 main teaching style proposed by Anthony Grasha, a cognitive and social psychologist until his death in 2003, the authoritarian style is described as believing that there are &quot;correct, acceptable, and standard ways to do things&quot;.

==Gender issues==

Some say, girls tend to prefer one-on-one (dyadic) interaction, forming tight, intimate bonds, while boys prefer group activities. One study in particular found that boys performed almost twice as well in groups than in pairs, whereas girls did not show such a difference. In early adolescence, the variations in physical self-concepts appear slightly stronger for boys than girls. This includes self-concepts about movement, body, appearance and other physical attributes. Yet during periods of physical change such as infancy, adolescence and ageing, it is particularly useful to compare these self-concepts with measured skills before drawing broad conclusions 

Some studies suggest self-concept of social behaviours are substantially similar with specific variations for girls and boys. For instance, girls are more likely than boys to wait their turn to speak, agree with others, and acknowledge the contributions of others. It seems boys see themselves as building larger group relationships based on shared interests, threaten, boast, and call names. In mixed-sex pairs of children aged 33 months, girls were more likely to passively watch a boy play, and boys were more likely to be unresponsive to what the girls were saying. In some cultures, such stereotypical traits are sustained from childhood to adulthood suggesting a strong influence of expectations by other people in these cultures. The key impacts of social self-concepts on social behaviours and of social behaviours on social self-concepts is a vital area of ongoing research.

In contrast, research suggest overall similarities for gender groups in self-concepts about academic work. In general, any variations are systematically gender-based yet small in terms of effect sizes. Any variations suggest overall academic self-concept are slightly stronger for men than women in mathematics, science and technology and slightly stronger for women than men about language related skills. It is important to observe there is no link between self concepts and skills [i.e., correlations about r = 0.19 are rather weak if statistically significant with large samples]. Clearly, even small variations in perceived self-concepts tend to reflect gender stereotypes evident in some cultures . In recent years, more women have been entering into the STEM field, working in predominantly mathematics, technology and science related careers. Many factors play a role in variations in gender effects on self-concept to accumulate as attitudes to mathematics and science; in particular, the impact other people&#x27;s expectations rather than role-models on our self-concepts .

==Media==
A commonly-asked question is &quot;why do people choose one form of media over another?&quot; According to the Galileo Model, there are different forms of media spread throughout three-dimensional space. The closer one form of media is to another the more similar the source of media is to each other. The farther away from each form of media is in space, the least similar the source of media is. For example, mobile and cell phone are located closest in space where as newspaper and texting are farthest apart in space. The study further explained the relationship between self-concept and the use of different forms of media. The more hours per day an individual uses a form of media, the closer that form of media is to their self-concept.

Self-concept is related to the form of media most used. If one considers oneself tech savvy, then one will use mobile phones more often than one would use a newspaper. If one considers oneself old fashioned, then one will use a magazine more often than one would instant message.

In this day and age, social media is where people experience most of their communication. With developing a sense of self on a psychological level, feeling as part of a greater body such as social, emotional, political bodies can affect how one feels about themselves. If a person is included or excluded from a group, that can affect how they form their identities. Growing social media is a place for not only expressing an already formed identity, but to explore and experiment with developing identities. In the United Kingdom, a study about changing identities revealed that some people believe that partaking in online social media is the first time they have felt like themselves, and they have achieved their true identities. They also revealed that these online identities transferred to their offline identities.

A 2007 study was done on adolescents aged 12 to 18 to view the ways in which social media affects the formation of an identity. The study found that it affected the formation in three different ways: risk taking, communication of personal views, and perceptions of influences. In this particular study, risk taking behavior was engaging with strangers. When it came to communication about personal views, half of the participants reported that it was easier to express these opinions online, because they felt an enhanced ability to be creative and meaningful. When it came to other&#x27;s opinions, one subject reported finding out more about themselves, like openness to experience, because of receiving differing opinions on things such as relationships.

<text>[[Josephine Baker]] in a banana skirt from the Folies Bergère production &quot;Un Vent de Folie&quot;, by [[Stanisław Julian Ignacy Ostroróg|Walery]], 1927

The Folies Bergère () is a cabaret music hall in Paris, France. Located at 32 Rue Richer in the 9th Arrondissement, the Folies Bergère was built as an opera house by the architect Plumeret. It opened on 2 May 1869 as the Folies Trévise, with light entertainment including operettas, comic opera, popular songs, and gymnastics. It became the Folies Bergère on 13 September 1872, named after nearby Rue Bergère. The house was at the height of its fame and popularity from the 1890s&#x27; &quot;Belle Époque&quot; through the 1920s.

Revues featured extravagant costumes, sets and effects, and often nude women. In 1926, Josephine Baker, an African-American expatriate singer, dancer and entertainer, caused a sensation at the Folies Bergère by dancing in a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas and little else.

The institution is still in business, and is still a strong symbol of French and Parisian life. The métro stations are Cadet and Grands Boulevards.

==History==

Located at 32 Rue Richer in the 9th Arrondissement, and opened on 2 May 1869, the Folies Bergère, as the Folies Trévise, was built as an opera house, and patterned after the Alhambra music hall in London by the architect, Plumeret, who was a building inspector of the crown

 The term &quot;folies&quot; refers to pleasure houses, vacation homes built from the end of the 18th century near large cities to discreetly shelter the adulterous loves of the bourgeoisie and aristocrats. 

It opened on 2 May 1869 as the Folies Trévise, with light entertainment including operettas, opéra comique (comic opera), popular songs, and gymnastics. The original name because of a street of that name by the stage door. However, the Duc de Trévise objected.

on 13 September 1872, It became the Folies Bergère, named after a nearby street, Rue Bergère (&quot;bergère&quot; means &quot;shepherdess&quot;).

In 1882, Édouard Manet painted his well-known painting &quot;A Bar at the Folies-Bergère&quot; which depicts a bar-girl, one of the demimondaines, standing before a mirror.

In 1886, Édouard Marchand conceived a new genre of entertainment for the Folies Bergère: the music-hall revue. Women would be the heart of Marchand&#x27;s concept for the Folies. In 30 November 1886, the Folies Bergère, staged the first revue-style music hall show &quot;Place au jeûne !&quot;, featuring and scantily clad chorus girls, was a tremendous success. 

In the early 1890s, the American dancer Loie Fuller starred at the Folies Bergère. In 1902, illness forced Marchand to leave after 16 years.

In 1918, (1880–1966) made his mark on the revue. His revues featured extravagant costumes, sets and effects, and &quot;small nude women&quot;. Derval&#x27;s small nude women would become the hallmark of the Folies. During his 48 years at the Folies, he launched the careers of many French stars including Maurice Chevalier, Mistinguett, Josephine Baker, Fernandel and many others. In 1926, Baker, an African-American expatriate singer, dancer, and entertainer, caused a sensation at the Folies Bergère in a new revue, &quot;La Folie du Jour&quot;, in which she danced a number &quot;Fatou&quot; wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas and little else, and &quot;Un Vent De Folie&quot;(1927). Her erotic dancing and near-nude performances were renowned. The Folies Bergère catered to popular taste. Shows featured elaborate costumes; the women&#x27;s were frequently revealing, practically leaving them naked, and shows often contained a good deal of nudity. Shows also played up the &quot;exoticness&quot; of people and objects from other cultures, obliging the Parisian fascination with the négritude of the 1920s.

In 1926 the facade of the theatre was given a complete make-over by the artist . The facade was redone in Art Deco style, one of the many Parisian theatres of this period using the style.

In 1936, Derval brought Baker from New York City to lead the revue &quot;En Super Folies&quot;. , a young Hungarian arrived from Balassagyarmat, his hometown, designed the poster for &quot;En Super Folies&quot;, a show starring Baker in 1936. This began a long love story between Michel Gyarmathy, Paris, the Folies Bergère and the public of the whole world which lasted 56 years. The funeral of Paul Derval was held on 20 May 1966. He was 86 and had reigned supreme over the most celebrated music hall in the world. His wife Antonia, supported by Michel Gyarmathy, succeeded him. In August 1974, the Folies Antonia Derval passed on the direction of the business to Hélène Martini, the empress of the night (25 years earlier she had been a showgirl in the revues). This new mistress of the house reverted to the original concept to maintain the continued existence of the last music hall which remained faithful to the tradition.

Since 2006, the Folies Bergère has presented some musical productions with Stage Entertainment like &quot;Cabaret&quot; (2006–2008) or &quot;Zorro&quot; (2009–2010).

<text>Tam Kung () or Tam Tai Sin () is a sea deity worshiped in Hong Kong and Macau.

In Chinese folk legends, Tam Kung was one of gods who could forecast the weather. He was born in Huizhou Prefecture. It was said that he could cure patients in his childhood. Tam Kung became an immortal in heaven at the age of twenty in the Nine-dragon Mountain in Huizhou. He was officially deified during the Qing dynasty. People whose ancestral home are in Huizhou or Chaoshan of Guangdong province worship Tam Kung most sincerely.
==Temples in Hong Kong==
===Shau Kei Wan===
The Tam Kung Sin Shing Temple () is located along Tam Kung Temple Road, at the northern end of Shau Kei Wan Main Street East, in A Kung Ngam, Shau Kei Wan. It was originally a small shrine. Local people raised money to construct it in 1905 and reconstructed it many times afterwards.

The statue of Tam Kung, which was first worshipped among the other gods in the temple, was formerly positioned in the Tam Kung Temple in Tam Kung Road () in Kowloon City. There is a big rock in front of the temple and is believed to be Tam Kung&#x27;s magic stamp. Local residents and fishermen are the sincere worshippers. On the birthday of Tam Kung (8th day of the 4th month in Chinese calendar), they will have a celebration and play a so-called &quot;kung fu&quot; show which is a major part of the celebration. A parade and dragon dance are also held on this occasion.

The temple has been managed by the Chinese Temples Committee since 1928. The temple is a former Grade I historic building. It is a Grade III historic building since April 2013.

===Happy Valley===
A Tam Kung Temple is located on a small hill at No.9 Blue Pool Road, Happy Valley, at the intersection with Ventris Road. This temple was built in 1901 after the previous one located on a slope near the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital in Happy Valley, in the former Wong Nai Chung Village, was demolished during urban development. According to a story, Tam Kung appeared to a young boy in a dream and guided him to the present site, which was regarded as selected by the deity for the new location of the temple. A Tin Hau Temple, also relocated in 1901, is situated at the back of this temple. The temples have been managed by the Chinese Temples Committee since 1929.

===Southern District===
The Tam Kung Yea Temple () is located off Shek Pai Wan Road, in Tin Wan, Southern District.

===Ping Chau===
The Tam Tai Sin Temple (), in Sha Tau, Tung Ping Chau was built around 1877. Many early residents of Tung Ping Chau were from Shantou and they kept the tradition of worshipping Tam Kung after they settled on the island. The Temple celebrates the Tam Kung Festival on the 8th day of the fourth Lunar month.

<doc id="489357" wikidata="Q2701330" url="?curid=489357" title="Albion-class landing platform dock">
<text>The &quot;Albion&quot;-class landing platform dock is a class of amphibious warfare ship in service with the Royal Navy. The class consists of two vessels, and , ordered in 1996 to replace the ageing . Both ships were built by BAE Systems Marine at the former Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering yard in Barrow-in-Furness. &quot;Albion&quot; was commissioned in 2003 and &quot;Bulwark&quot; in 2005. Each of the ships has a crew of 325 and can accommodate up to 405 troops. Thirty-one large trucks and thirty-six smaller vehicles and main battle tanks can be carried inside the vehicle deck. To disembark troops and vehicles, the vessels are equipped with eight landing craft. As of 2024, both vessels were in reserve. In November 2024, the newly elected Labour government indicated that the ships would be removed from service by March 2025.

==Development==
The value of the two s was highlighted during the Falklands War. Not only did the ships transport troops and vehicles to the South Atlantic, the commanders of the landing operations at San Carlos were aboard , and once they arrived their flight decks were used to support airborne operations by helicopters and Sea Harrier jets.

As these ships were built in the 1960s, on 18 July 1996 the British Ministry of Defence awarded a £450 million contract for their replacements to Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd (VSEL) in Barrow-in-Furness.

The ships&#x27; roles are &quot;to act as the afloat command platform for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Amphibious Task Force and Landing Force Commanders when embarked&quot; and &quot;to embark, transport, deploy and recover troops with their equipment and vehicles which form part of an amphibious assault force&quot;. They are larger and more capable than the &quot;Fearless&quot; class, and formed part of a modernization programme of the British amphibious fleet, which included the helicopter carrier (until 2018), the s of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and the s.

===Extended readiness===
To cut the running costs of the Royal Navy, the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review concluded that one of its two &quot;Albion&quot;-class LPDs should be placed into extended readiness, or uncrewed reserve, while the other is held at high readiness for operations. The vessels were to alternate between extended readiness and high readiness throughout their service lives.

It was confirmed that &quot;Albion&quot; would be the first of the two vessels to be placed at extended readiness, for a cost of £2.5 million, as &quot;Bulwark&quot; had recently finished a major refit. Running costs while in extended readiness are estimated to be £300,000 per annum to keep the vessel available for reactivation at short notice. HMS &quot;Albion&quot; re-entered high readiness when HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; was put into extended readiness. In 2014 Albion entered a regeneration refit and rejoined the active fleet in 2016. The running costs of one of the &quot;Albion&quot;-class vessels at high readiness ranged from £17.7 million to £38.6 million per annum from 2007 to 2011. As of late 2018 &quot;Albion&quot; was in active service while &quot;Bulwark&quot; was held at extended readiness. 

In 2024, it was reported that, due to manning problems in the Royal Navy and despite the pending completion of a major refit of HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;, both vessels were now expected to remain in reserve. In May 2024, the Navy indicated that it intended to retain both ships until 2033/34 when they would be replaced by the future Multi Role Support Ships (MRSS). However, in November 2024, the recently elected Labour government indicated that they would in fact be retired early in order to save money.

==Characteristics==
The &quot;Albion&quot;-class LPDs have a length of , a breadth of , and a draught of . They have a normal displacement of , at full load and when the dock is flooded. The ships have a crew of 325 and can accommodate up to 405 troops, including their vehicles and combat supplies, in overload conditions. The GE Electric Propulsion System is powered by two Wärtsilä Vasa 16V 32E diesel generators generating at 6.6kV which drive two electric motors, two shafts, and a bow thruster as well as providing all the services power on the vessel. The first diesel electric propulsion system to be used in a Royal Navy surface ship was in the 1960s built &quot;Hecla&quot;-class ocean survey ships. This is the first in a major surface combatant vessel. It reduces the engine room crew by about 66 per cent compared with the preceding &quot;Fearless&quot; class of ships. The diesel electric system can propel the ships to a maximum speed of 18 knots and have a range of .

The aft flight deck has two landing spots for aircraft the size of a Chinook, although it has no hangar or aircraft storage facility. Below the flight deck are the dock and vehicle deck. The latter has the capacity to hold thirty-one large trucks and thirty-six smaller vehicles or six Challenger 2 tanks and thirty armoured personnel carriers. The dock can hold four Landing Craft Utility MK10, each large enough to carry vehicles up to main battle tank size, which are then launched by flooding of the dock area. Four smaller LCVP MK5 that can carry thirty-five men or two light trucks are carried on davits, two each side of the ship&#x27;s superstructure. Each ship also carries a fifty-two ton tracked beach recovery vehicle for assisting with landing craft recovery, as well as two tractors: one that can lay a track-way across a landing beach, and the second fitted with an excavating bucket and forks.

===Weapons and sensors===
For defence against missile attack, the &quot;Albion&quot;-class LPDs were fitted with two 30 mm Goalkeeper CIWSs mounted fore and aft on the superstructure and two 20 mm cannon located on the forward superstructure. Defensive countermeasures include the Outfit DLJ decoys, eight Seagnat radar reflection / infra-red emitting decoy launchers and a BAE Systems DLH off-board decoy. In 2017, &quot;Albion&quot; had her Goalkeeper mounts removed and replaced by a pair of 20mm Phalanx mounts as part of her refit prior to returning to active service; &quot;Bulwark&quot; will have her Goalkeeper mounts removed upon her entry into Extended Readiness.

When commissioned, the ships were fitted with two Kelvin Hughes Type 1007/8 I-band radars, for navigation and aircraft control. For air and surface search, a Selex Sensors and Airborne Systems Radar Type 996 E/F band radar was fitted. From 2013 on, RT996 will be gradually replaced by the BAE Systems Maritime Services Artisan 3D E/F-band (designated RT997). was the first Royal Navy ship so fitted; RT997 will be fitted to &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Bulwark&quot; by 2015. There is also an ADAWS 2000 combat data system and a UAT/1-4 Electronic support measures (ESM) system.

==Decommission and sale==
The decommission of the ships by the RN is planned for March 2025. On 20 December 2024, was reported that the Brazilian Navy is in negotiation with RN to buy HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;. On 26 January 2025, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reported the sale for Brazil of the two boats of the class, &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Bulwark&quot;, in a negociation of £20 million (R$145 million), yet to be confirmed by the Royal and Brazilian navies. On 4 February 2025, the Brazilian Navy confirmed the negociations to the newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot;.

==Ships – disposal and current state==
===HMS &quot;Albion&quot;===
HMS &quot;Albion&quot; was launched at Barrow-in-Furness on 9 March 2001. After completing sea trials, &quot;Albion&quot; was commissioned in June 2003 and became fully operational in April 2004. Her home port is HMNB Devonport on the south coast of England.

In December 2010, it was announced that &quot;Albion&quot; would be the next Royal Navy flagship after . She was deployed with the Response Force Task Group to the Gulf of Sidra off Libya to assist the ongoing NATO-led operation, and then moved into the Indian Ocean in June 2011 to assist with anti-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa. In 2011 she entered a state of &quot;extended readiness&quot;. In July 2017, she re-entered active service after a long re-fit. While remaining temporarily deployable if required, in July 2023 she entered reduced readiness (skeleton crew aboard for ship maintenance). By early 2024, she was reported to have transitioned to &quot;extended readiness&quot; (uncrewed reserve).

===HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;===
HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;, the second in the class, was launched at Barrow-in-Furness in November 2001, and was commissioned in December 2004.

One of &quot;Bulwark&quot;″s first missions was Operation Highbrow in the Mediterranean in July 2006. Docking in Beirut, the ship evacuated around 1,300 United Kingdom nationals. In May 2010, she entered dry-dock at HMNB Devonport for a £30 million refit. In October 2011, &quot;Bulwark&quot;, having just completed an eight-month refit, became the flagship of the fleet. The refit improved her machinery and magazines, converted her to full night-vision tactical ability for landing craft and aircraft, and gave her the ability to operate two Chinook helicopters from the flight deck at the same time. She returned to reserve in 2016 and was expected to complete a lengthy refit in 2024 but nevertheless remain in uncrewed reserve, though with an ability to deploy &quot;if required&quot;. Despite this recent refit (which had already cost £72.1 million), in November 2024 it was indicated that HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;, along with her sister ship, would in fact be taken out of service completely.

<text>HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; is the second ship of the Royal Navy&#x27;s assault ships. She is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s two landing platform docks designed to put Royal Marines ashore by air and by sea though is due to be retired by March 2025.

Although launched in 2001, delays caused the delivery date to be put back, and the ship entered service on 28 April 2005. Together with , and other amphibious ships, she has provided a larger and more effective amphibious capability than the previous vessels. Between October 2011 and June 2015 she was the fleet flagship of the Royal Navy. She has been in extended upkeep since 2020. The ship is designed to send large numbers of troops and vehicles to shore as quickly as possible. &quot;Bulwark&quot; has supported a permanently embarked Royal Marines landing craft unit, 4 Assault Squadron Royal Marines. The rear of &quot;Bulwark&quot; opens and floods a compartment, allowing the boats inside to be launched. The flight deck is able to take two Sea King HC4 or Merlin medium-lift helicopters and stow a third. The deck can also support two Chinook heavy-lift helicopters, one down the side of the flight deck and one at the rear of the flight deck. Although the &quot;Albion&quot; design does not have a hangar, the ship has sufficient equipment to support helicopter operations.

&quot;Bulwark&quot; was launched at the BAE Systems shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, on 15 November 2001. She is, to date, the most recent surface vessel to have been constructed at Barrow with the yard currently specialising in submarine construction.

==Operational history==
&quot;Bulwark&quot; departed the UK in January 2006 for a six-month East of Suez maiden deployment. She conducted counter-terrorist and counter-piracy tasks in waters off the Horn of Africa. &quot;Bulwark&quot; then headed for the northern Persian Gulf to become the flagship of Task Force 158, providing security for Iraqi oil platforms. At the start of mid 2006 &quot;Bulwark&quot; was near Spain. Due to the 2006 Israel–Lebanon crisis, on 15 July 2006 she was ordered to divert to Lebanon and to support operations evacuating British citizens from the conflict area. On 20 July, she evacuated approximately 1,300 people from Beirut in the biggest British evacuation. On completion of her extended deployment the ship returned to the United Kingdom. At the start of June 2007 &quot;Bulwark&quot; was berthed at Sunderland on the River Wear.

In October 2008, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was at the Tail of the Bank in the Firth of Clyde together with the aircraft carrier and the French amphibious ship , taking part in Exercise Joint Warrior 2008.

On 18 February 2009, &quot;Bulwark&quot; sailed from Devonport as flagship to Commander UK Amphibious Task Group, Commodore Peter Hudson, on the Taurus 09 deployment. She was joined by Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) , Type 23 frigates and and four ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

In May 2010, she entered a dry-dock at HMNB Devonport to refit, eventually rejoining the fleet in March 2011, and then took over as fleet flagship from her sister ship &quot;Albion&quot; in October 2011. She made a five-day visit to London on 16 March 2011. &quot;Bulwark&quot; undertook Operational Sea Training at the end of June 2011 in preparation to take up the role of fleet flagship of the Royal Navy. &quot;Bulwark&quot; was on standby as leading ship of the UK&#x27;s recently formed Response Force Task Group. In October she participated in Exercise Joint Warrior in Loch Eriboll, the largest war games staged in the UK, involving the French Marines and other NATO forces.

On 15 February 2012, &quot;Bulwark&quot; made an unscheduled stop in Kiel, Germany, after ice on the Elbe river prevented her from entering the city of Hamburg as originally planned. At the end of February, &quot;Bulwark&quot; visited the Polish port of Gdynia, carrying out exercises with two Polish frigates, and . She also hosted onboard over 4,000 people from the city. The vessel had entered the Baltic Sea to prepare for Exercise &#x27;Cold Response&#x27;, a NATO winter war games exercise due to take place in northern Norway in March 2012. In April, she also took part in Exercise &#x27;Joint Warrior&#x27; with several other British and foreign vessels including the aircraft carrier off the coast of Scotland. She was part of the COUGAR 13 task group, with the Commander UK Task Group and his staff embarked on board. She was visited by the Commander of Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO.

At the end of May 2014, &quot;Bulwark&quot; visited Greenwich in London, where the public were able to visit the ship for tours conducted by the crew, and she also took part in celebrations marking the 350th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Marines. In late 2014 &quot;Bulwark&quot; was deployed for the COUGAR 14 Response Force Task Group annual exercise and the International Mine Counter Measures Exercise (IMCMEX).

Between April and July 2015 &quot;Bulwark&quot; was allocated to Operation Weald, the upgraded search and rescue operation of the Italian coast for migrants crossing from Libya. She was assisted by three Merlin HM.2 helicopters from 814 Naval Air Squadron. &quot;Bulwark&quot; recovered over 2,900 migrants from the sea during the operation. &quot;Bulwark&quot; assisted in providing security for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Malta in November. This duty was completed in December 2015.

In 2016, the ship was the flagship for Exercise Griffin Strike, the validation exercise for the Anglo-French Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, after which she participated in the Centenary commemorations for the Battle of Jutland in Scapa Flow. In July, the ship came alongside Sunderland and exercised the Freedom of the City of Durham with a full ceremonial parade through the streets, finishing with a service at St Cuthbert&#x27;s Cathedral. In September 2016, the ship again acted as the flagship for the Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime) 16 deployment (the new name for the COUGAR series of deployments) and, with COMATG embarked, deployed for exercises off (and with) Albania, France, Israel, Somaliland, and Oman.

As announced in 2011, &quot;Bulwark&quot; entered extended readiness (uncrewed reserve) in early 2017, and transferred her role as Fleet Amphibious Flagship to her sister ship &quot;Albion&quot; on her emergence from refit.

According to the Ministry of Defence, the planned out-of-service date for &quot;Bulwark&quot; is 2034. However, in October 2017, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; reported that the Ministry of Defence was considering decommissioning &quot;Bulwark&quot; and &quot;Albion&quot; as part of a package of cost-cutting measures intended to mitigate the expense of the Royal Navy&#x27;s two new aircraft carriers. This action was reversed by then Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson in September 2018.

In late 2020 &quot;Bulwark&quot; was dry-docked for phase two of her optimised support period. The ship was to remain in dry dock prior to undertaking a phase 3 &quot;recertification package&quot; ahead of her planned return to the fleet in 2023. In mid-2023 it was reported that the ship would not be ready for active operations until sometime in 2024. Then in March 2024 James Cartlidge, Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence, stated that the ship would in fact only return to operations &quot;if required&quot;, suggesting that she would remain in uncrewed reserve upon completing her refit. However, this decision was reversed by the newly-elected Labour Government in November 2024 which indicated that &quot;Bulwark&quot; was to be taken out of service, despite the fact that £72.1 million had already been spent on her refit.

==In the media==
&quot;Bulwark&quot; is the featured ship in the second series of &quot;Warship&quot; originally shown on television channel Five in the UK. The season followed her during the Taurus 09 deployment.

&quot;Bulwark&quot; was heavily featured in Episode 2 of the 2017 series of &quot;Warship&quot; on Channel 4, which although based in , followed the entire Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime) 16 deployment.

<doc id="489360" wikidata="Q1542521" url="?curid=489360" title="Governor-General of the Philippines">
<text>The governor-general of the Philippines (; ; ) was the title of the government executive during the colonial period of the Philippines, first by the Spanish in Mexico City and later Madrid as &quot;Captain General&quot;– , ) from 1565–1898 and the United States (1898–1946), and briefly by Great Britain (1762–1764) and Japan (1942–1945). They were also the representative of the executive of the ruling power.

On November 15, 1935, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was established as a transitional government to prepare the country for independence from American control. The governor-general was replaced by an elected Filipino president of the Philippine Commonwealth, as the chief executive of the Philippines, taking over many of the duties of the governor-general. The former American governor-general then became known as the high commissioner to the Philippines.

From 1565 to 1898, the Philippines was under Spanish rule. From 1565 to 1821, the governor and captain-general was appointed by the viceroy of New Spain upon recommendation of the Spanish Cortes and governed on behalf of the monarch of Spain to govern the Captaincy General of the Philippines. When there was a vacancy (e.g. death, or during the transitional period between governors), the Real Audiencia in Manila appointed a temporary governor from among its members.

After Mexico won its independence in 1821, the country was no longer under the Viceroyalty of New Spain (present-day Mexico) and administrative affairs formerly handled by New Spain were transferred to Madrid and placed directly under the Spanish Crown.

== Under New Spain (1565–1764) ==
== British occupation of Manila (1762–1764) ==

After the Spanish defeat at the Battle of Manila in 1762, the Philippines was briefly governed simultaneously by two Governors-General, one of the Spanish Empire and one of the British Empire.

Great Britain shortly occupied Manila and the naval port of Cavite as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War, while the Spanish Governor-General set up a provisional government in Bacolor, Pampanga to continue administering the rest of the archipelago.

=== British governor-general ===
=== Spanish governor-general ===
== Under New Spain (1764–1821) ==
After the British returned Manila to the Spanish in 1764, the Spanish Governor-General Francisco Javier de la Torre resumed administration of the Philippines under the authority of the Viceroy of New Spain in modern-day Mexico (New Spain) as part of the Spanish Empire.

The Philippines, along with the rest of the Spanish Empire, became part of the First French Empire in 1808 after Napoleon overthrew Ferdinand VII and installed Joseph Bonaparte as king until his abdication in 1813, as part of a disastrous consequence of Napoleon&#x27;s 1812 Russian campaign, the Peninsular Wars, particularly the Battle of Vitoria, and of forming the Sixth Coalition.

== Direct Spanish control (1821–1899) ==
After the 1821 Mexican War of Independence, Mexico became independent and was no longer part of the Spanish Empire. The Viceroyalty of New Spain ceased to exist. The Philippines, as a result, was directly governed from Madrid, under the Spanish Crown.
== United States Military Government (1898–1902) ==
The city of Manila was captured by American expeditionary forces on August 13, 1898. On August 14, 1898, the terms of the Spanish capitulation were signed. From this date, American government in the Philippines begins. General Wesley Merritt, in accordance with the instructions of the United States President, issued a proclamation announcing the establishment of United States military rule.

During the transition period, executive authority in all civil affairs in the Philippine government was exercised by the military governor.

== Insular Government (1901–1935) ==

On July 4, 1901, executive authority over the islands was transferred to the president of the Second Philippine Commission who had the title of &quot;Civil Governor&quot;, a position appointed by the President of the United States and approved by the United States Senate. For the first year, a &quot;Military Governor&quot;, Adna Chaffee, ruled parts of the country still resisting the American rule, concurrent with Civil Governor, William Howard Taft. Disagreements between the two were not uncommon. The following year, on July 4, 1902, Taft became the sole executive authority. Chaffee remained commander of the Philippine Division until September 30, 1902.

After his retirement as Civil Governor, Governor Taft was appointed Secretary of War and he secured for his successor the adoption by Congress of the title &quot;Governor-General of the Philippine Islands&quot; thereby &quot;reviving the high designation used during the last period of Spanish rule and placing the office on a parity of dignity with that of other colonial empires of first importance&quot;. The term &quot;insular&quot; (from &quot;insula&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;island&quot;) refers to U.S. island territories that are not incorporated into either a state or a federal district. All insular areas were under the authority of the U.S. Bureau of Insular Affairs, a division of the US War Department.

== High Commissioner to the Philippines (1935–42 and 1945–46) ==

On November 15, 1935, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was inaugurated as a transitional government to prepare the country for independence. The office of President of the Philippine Commonwealth replaced the Governor-General as the country&#x27;s chief executive. The Governor-General became the High Commissioner of the Philippines with Frank Murphy, the last governor-general, as the first high commissioner. The High Commissioner exercised no executive power but rather represented the colonial power, the United States Government, in the Philippines. The high commissioner moved from Malacañang Palace to the newly built High Commissioner&#x27;s Residence, now the Embassy of the United States in Manila.

After the Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, the last High Commissioner, Paul McNutt, became the first United States Ambassador to the Philippines.

== Japanese military governors (1942–45) ==
In December 1941, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was invaded by Imperial Japan as part of World War II. The next year, the Japanese sent a military governor to control the country during the wartime period, followed by the formal establishment of the puppet Second Philippine Republic under Jose P. Laurel.

On September 2, 1945, the position of Governor-General of the Philippines was abolished. The Philippines&#x27; independence from the United States was proclaimed by the Treaty of Manila on July 4, 1946, installing Manuel Roxas as the fifth President of the Philippines and ushering in the Third Philippine Republic.

== Vice-governors of the Philippines ==
On October 29, 1901, the position of Vice-Governor was created. The Vice-Governor was appointed by the President of the United States to act as the Governor-General (known at that time as the Civil Governor) in case of illness or temporary absence.

<text>A unibrow (or jacco brow or monobrow; called synophrys in medicine) is a single eyebrow created when the two eyebrows meet in the middle above the bridge of the nose. The hair above the bridge of the nose is of the same color and thickness as the eyebrows, such that they converge to form one uninterrupted line of hair.

== History ==
The word &quot;monobrow&quot; first appeared in print in 1968, and the adjectival form &quot;monobrowed&quot; followed in 1973, in Martin Amis&#x27; novel &quot;The Rachel Papers&quot;. The first known use of the word &quot;unibrow&quot; was in 1981.

== Culture and beauty ==

Some nations prize the unibrow. It is a sign of beauty among Baluchi Omanis, whose women sometimes draw a black line joining the brows as a part of their routine makeup to fake a unibrow. A study found the prevalence of synophrys to be at 11.87% in the Omani population. In Tajikistan, where the unibrow is similarly viewed as attractive, some women dry and extract an herb known locally as &quot;usma&quot; and daub it onto their brows to mimic one. Urban women may do the same with a kohl liner or a kajal pen.

The unibrow has largely been seen as undesirable in the Americas and Europe, with the hairs often plucked, shaved, or waxed away.
Exceptions include the artist Frida Kahlo, famous for her unibrow, which she often depicted in self-portraits, and the Greek-Cypriot model Sophia Hadjipanteli.

The unibrow is also the trademark of the NBA player Anthony Davis, the football player Marouane Fellaini, and the YouTuber ElectroBOOM. The boxer Roberto Elizondo famously sported a unibrow during his professional career.

== Medicine ==
=== Genetics ===
The unibrow is a genetic trait. It is associated with the PAX3 gene.

=== Medical conditions ===
A unibrow is part of normal human variation, but can also stem from developmental disorders. A unibrow is a recognized feature of Cornelia De Lange syndrome, a genetic disorder whose main features include moderate to severe learning difficulties, limb abnormalities such as oligodactyly (fewer than normal fingers or toes), and phocomelia (malformed limbs), and facial abnormalities including a long philtrum (the slight depression/line between the nose and mouth).

Other medical conditions associated with a unibrow include:

<doc id="489367" wikidata="Q211121" url="?curid=489367" title="Aubenas">
<text>Aubenas (; ) is a commune in the southern part of the Ardèche department in Southern France. It is the seat of several government offices. The mountainous and rugged countryside is popular for vacation homes. The river Ardèche flows through the commune. Aubenas is one of the most populous communes in the Ardèche department with 12,479 inhabitants as of 2019, after Annonay and before Guilherand-Granges and Tournon-sur-Rhône.

Aubenas is the centre of an urban area, composed of 22 towns and villages including Vals-les-Bains, with 41,568 inhabitants (2018). Aside from its long-year commercial activity, it has a good strategic position on the tourist field, at crossroads of a regional natural park, the zone of the Ardèche river canyon and the start of mountains. The chestnut industry is one testimony of the intense agricultural activity earlier in time.

==Etymology==
The root &quot;alb-&quot;, meaning a height, is present in the name of the city (). And in fact, it is sat on the strategic position of a limestone base overlooking the valley of Ardèche.
Due to the long distance from a water source, the city was known informally as the city without water until the 19th century, when on 28 June 1863, under the leadership of the then Mayor John Mathon, water was pumped from an external source which fed 50 fountains across the city.
At the foot of the promontory pass route of Montélimar to Le Puy-en-Velay, lies the oldest axis of movement between the Rhone valley and the mountains of Auvergne. The privileged location between &quot;l&#x27;Ardèche méridionale&quot; (Southern Ardèche) and &quot;l&#x27;Ardèche verte&quot; (Green Ardèche) allowed for a crossroads between different types of agriculture and business. 

==History==
===The Middle Ages===
The hill on which the city is built is mentioned during the 5th century AD. It tells of a conflict between the bishops of the hill and the bishops of Viviers, which is a local commune in the same modern day department; for the construction of a fortress. By 1084, the bishop of the hill won the lengthy conflict. The area became the possession of the Baron, Montlaur; all the way from the Ardèche mountains to what is now the western border of the current day department of Ardèche.
The Baron&#x27;s family reigned 1084 to 1441 and built the tower, the wall and two large, round towers of the castle which is surrounded by a moat that is why in French Aubenas is called &quot;La cité des Montlaur&quot;. The lords who were not only at the origin of the economic growth of the city, but also the social and material development of its residents. Their motto was: &quot;Montlaur, au plus haut!&quot;. 

===Renaissance===
During the Renaissance, the city became Protestant, and after the third French war of religion, the residents refused to allow royal troops within the city walls.

==Demographics==

<text>&#x27; (; ) or &#x27; (endonym: ) is a northern dialect of Occitan spoken in central and southern France, in particular in the former administrative region of Auvergne.

Currently, research shows that there is not really a true Auvergnat dialect but rather a vast northern Occitan linguistic area. 
The word &quot;Auvergnat&quot; is above all a local historiographical creation. According to linguist Jean Roux, &quot;It is by simplification that we use this term, because in no case Auvergnat can be considered as an autonomous linguistic entity&quot;.

With around 80,000 speakers in the Auvergne region at the beginning of the 21st century, it is considered to be severely endangered.

== Classification ==
Auvergnat falls under the following categories and subcategories: Indo-European, Italic, Romance, Italo-Western, Gallo-Iberian, Gallo-Romance, Occitan.

== History ==
Several troubadours were from the Auvergne, including Castelloza, Dalfi d&#x27;Alvernhe, the Monje de Montaudon, the Vesques de Clarmon, Peire d&#x27;Alvernhe, Peire Rogier and Pons de Capduelh. They did not, however, compose in the Auvergnat dialect, but in the standard literary register of Old Occitan.

Official documents in Auvergnat become common around 1340 and continue to be found down to 1540, when the transition to French was complete. The high point for the use of Auvergnat as an official language was between 1380 and 1480. There is a passion play, &quot;Passion d&#x27;Auvergne&quot;, first performed in Montferrand in 1477, that is written mainly in French but which contains an Auvergnat section of 66 lines. Auvergnat had been replaced by French in official usage in the Montferrand already in 1388. French had also supplanted Auvergnat as the language of the upper classes, but it remained the language of rural communities.

==Geographical distribution==


The effective borders of Auvergnat do not completely coincide with those of the current Region of Auvergne or the historical region of Auvergne but can be described as follows:

* The entire département of the Puy-de-Dôme
* a large section of the département of Cantal, largely centred on Saint-Flour and Mauriac. Aurillac and the Pierrefort Canton speak a dialect called &quot;carladézien&quot;, a form of languedocien, with Auvergnat conjugations and the rest largely similar to standard languedocien.
* The larger portion of the Haute-Loire aside Yssingeaux which speaks Vivaro-Alpine.
* the southern half of Allier, or the Bourbonnais province, near Montluçon and Vichy, with the northern half toward Moulins traditionally speaking French.
* The communities of Noirétable and La Chamba in the western side of the département of Loire.

===A more precise view on Auvergnat boundaries===
There are strong oppositions between Pierre Bonnaud (for whom the Auvergnat is a language of its own, see the light orange line on the map – note it is including the easternmost part of the Marchois dialect) and for instance Roger Teulat.

====Language boundaries====
* 1: Latin pratus (meadow) &gt; pra (Occitan, Francoprovençal) vs. pré (French)
* 2: Latin nepos (nephew) &gt; nebot (Occitan) vs. neveu. (French, Francoprovençal)
Light blue area labelled fr is for French-Langue d&#x27;Oïl. Light purple area labelled frp is for Francoprovençal.

====Dialect boundaries====
* 0: Absence of paroxytonic stress in the north – defines the Marchois dialect, a name often given to the Occitan spoken in the Croissant area. The area labelled m is that of the Marchois dialect.
* 3: The ca/cha boundary separated Northern Occitan (Limousin, Auvergnat, Vivaro-Alpine, Marchois) and Southern Occitan (Gascon, Languedocien, Provençal). It is part of the Auvergnat boundary, along with 7, in Cantal. Area lm is for the Limousin dialect, va for Vivaro-Alpine, lg for Languedocien.
* 4: Feminines in &quot;–ada&quot; have lost intervocalic &quot;d&quot; and became &quot;–aa&quot;: this separates Auvergnat and Vivaro-Alpine (almost the same boundary for first person indicative present in &quot;–o&quot; [u], another characteristic of Vivaro-Alpine).

====Definition boundaries====
These are not characteristic of Auvergnat as a whole but allow for defining a boundary:
* 5 and 6: These match the Core Auvergnat, according to Pierre Bonnaud. They may be used for the western boundary of Auvergnat. Area 5 has the pronunciation [jaR] of &quot;èr&quot; (around [ɛR]), area 6 has the palatalisation of &#x27;cl&#x27; to [kʎ] or [çʎ].
* 7: Southeastern boundary has an opposition between &quot;dreita&quot; and &quot;drecha&quot;
* 8: This is for the southern boundary: the plural of &quot;braç&quot; has the same pronunciation than the singular; only the article allows differentiation.

Note that most Occitanists use rather 7 than 8 to define the southern boundary.

====Internal variation====
Note some of the definition boundaries allow defining an internal variation. The most traditional one between Lower or Northern Auvergnat and Upper or Southern Auvergnat is the mutation of &quot;s&quot; before [k], [p], and [t] (line 9). Lower Auvergnat, defined by Teulat, is the light green area labelled 1 on the map. Upper Auvergnat, defined by Teulat, is the light brown-yellow area labelled 2 on the map. A broader area (light yellow) is generally defined. A Northwestern Auvergnat may be defined as well by 5 and 6. The Northeastern (East of 5 and 6, North of 9) has, according to Bonnaud, a stronger influence from French phonetics (a bit like Marchois).

==Subdialects==

Auvergnat is most often categorized in the Northern Occitan dialect group, along with Limousin and Vivaro-Alpine.

There are two primary distinctions in Auvergnat:

* Northern Auvergnat (&quot;nord-auvergnat&quot;, also &quot;bas-auvergnat&quot;) in Puy-de-Dôme and Allier (Bourbonnais) and Haute-Loire north of Brioude.
** In the south of Allier (Bourbonnais), the local &quot;nord-auvergnat&quot; has been heavily influenced by French, but Auvergnat linguistic traits remain dominant. This transition zone to French, called locally &quot;le Croissant&quot;, includes the northern fringe of Limousin. See also the article on Bourbonnais.
* Southern Auvergnat (&quot;sud-auvergnat&quot;, also &quot;haut-auvergnat&quot;) spoken in Cantal, Haute-Loire (with a part of Ardèche and most of Lozère).

The suggestion that Auvergnat is an independent language, distinct from Occitan, has found little resonance with linguists, especially Romance linguists. It is strongly defended by those who espouse the &quot;norme bonnaudienne&quot; a standardization of Auvergnat.

== Linguistic vitality and usage ==

An understanding of the vitality and overall usage of Auvergnat can be garnered from a survey carried out in 2006 in the Auvergne region.

The largest group of the two languages spoken in the Auvergne region is referred to as &quot;patois&quot; (78% of the population) compared with other regional terms, with certain cultural identities emerging, such as &quot;auvergnat&quot; (10%), &quot;occitan&quot; (8%), &quot;bourbonnais&quot; (5%) or &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot; (4%).

The regional language, whether Occitan (in the whole of the Auvergne region) or Oïl (the north of Allier), represents a strong presence in the region:

* 61% claim to understand their regional language more-or-less, with 22% claiming to understand it easily or perfectly.
* 42% claim to be able to speak it more-or-less, with 12% claiming it as easy.
* 29% claim to read Auvergnat more-or-less, with 10% claiming it easy.
* 17% claim to write Auvergnat more-or-less, with 4% declaring it easy.

A large part of the population that understands or speaks even a little or, moreover, fluently, neither know how to write nor read in that language.

Language learning is found to be essential within the home, according to the survey, (grandparents noted as 61%, or other family members at 50%) with a very weak result from the schools (10%). Herein is found the problem of language-transmission when dependent upon State sponsorship. 40% of adults who did not teach their language to their children report regretting it at the time of the survey. This feeling is reported more strongly among the 35 or less demographic, at 58%. The desire to learn the local language is reported strongly, with increasing representation among the young, reported at 23%. According to the survey the desire to incorporate local language learning in schools is as follows: Haute-Loire (53%), Puy-de-Dôme (51%) et Cantal (74%). The desire to teach to their own children is strong (41%) and is stronger still with the 35 and under demographic (58%). 71% of the region&#x27;s inhabitants are favorable to the idea of maintaining the regional language and culture, with a stronger result in the 35-and-unders (76%). To achieve this desire, different institutions are expected to play a role (in percentage of those surveyed):

* France 3 Auvergne, the local television channel should offer regional language programming (54%)
* The Region (54%), National Education (43%), the Culture Ministry (42%) and the communities are seen by most Auvergnats as the most correct venues to develop and pass on the Auvergnat language and culture.

<text>The Israel Aircraft Industries Kfir (, &quot;Lion Cub&quot;) is an Israeli all-weather multirole combat aircraft based on the French Dassault Mirage 5, with Israeli avionics and an Israeli-built version of the General Electric J79 turbojet engine.

==Development==

===Background===

The project that would ultimately give birth to the Kfir can be traced back to the IDF&#x27;s need for adapting the Dassault Mirage IIIC to the specific requirements of the Israeli Air Force (IAF).

The all-weather, delta-winged Mirage IIICJ was the first Mach 2 aircraft acquired by Israel from then-close ally France, and constituted the backbone of the IAF during most of the 1960s, until the arrival of the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and, most importantly, the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, by the end of the decade. While the Mirage IIICJ proved to be extremely effective in the air-superiority role, its relatively short range imposed some limitations on its usefulness as a ground-attack aircraft.

Thus, in the mid-1960s, at the request of Israel, Dassault Aviation began developing the Mirage 5, a fair-weather, ground-attack version of the Mirage III. Following the suggestions made by the Israelis, advanced avionics located behind the cockpit were removed, allowing the aircraft to increase its fuel-carrying capacity while reducing maintenance costs.

By 1968, Dassault had finished production of the 50 Mirage 5Js paid for by Israel, but an arms embargo imposed upon Israel by the French government in 1967 prevented deliveries from taking place. The Israelis replied by producing an unlicensed copy of the Mirage 5, the Nesher, with technical specifications for both the airframe and the engine obtained by Israeli spies.

===Design===
The Kfir programme originated in the quest to develop a more capable version of the IAI Nesher, which was already in series production. After General De Gaulle embargoed the sale of arms to Israel, the IAF feared that it might lose qualitative superiority over its adversaries in the future, which were receiving increasingly advanced Soviet aircraft. The main and most advanced type of aircraft available to the IAF was the Mirage, but a severe problem developed due to the Mirage fleet&#x27;s depletion due to attrition after the Six-Day War. Domestic production would circumvent the embargo restrictions completely; efforts to reverse engineer and reproduce components of the Mirage were aided by Israeli espionage efforts to obtain technical assistance and blueprints from third party Mirage operators.

Two powerplants were initially selected for trials, the General Electric J79 turbojet and the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan. In the end, the J79 was selected, not least because it was the same engine used on the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which the Israelis began to acquire from the United States in 1969, along with a license to produce the J79 themselves. The J79 was clearly superior to the original French Atar 09, providing a dry thrust of 49 kN (11,000 lbf) and an afterburning thrust of 83.4 kN (18,750 lbf).

In order to accommodate the new powerplant on the Mirage III&#x27;s airframe, and to deliver the added cooling required by the J79, the aircraft&#x27;s rear fuselage was slightly shortened and widened, its air intakes were enlarged, and a large air inlet was installed at the base of the vertical stabilizer, so as to supply the extra cooling needed for the afterburner. The engine itself was encased in a titanium heatshield.

A two-seat Mirage IIIBJ fitted with the GE J79 made its first flight in September 1970, and was soon followed by a re-engined Nesher, which flew in September 1971.

An improved prototype of the aircraft, with the name Ra&#x27;am B (&quot;Ra&#x27;am&quot; means &quot;Thunder&quot;; the &quot;Ra&#x27;am A&quot; was the Nesher), made its first flight in June 1973. It had an extensively revised cockpit, a strengthened landing gear, and a considerable amount of Israeli-built avionics. The internal fuel tanks were slightly rearranged, their total capacity being increased to .

There were unconfirmed reports that a number of the original Mirage IIICs, re-engined with the J79 and given the name &quot;Barak&quot; (&quot;Lightning&quot;), took part in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, but some sources point out that there is no evidence that these aircraft ever existed.

==Operational history==
===Israel===
The Kfir entered service with the IAF in 1975, the first units being assigned to the 101st &quot;First Fighter&quot; Squadron. Over the following years, several other squadrons were also equipped with the new aircraft. The role of the Kfir as the IAF&#x27;s primary air superiority asset was short-lived, as the first F-15 Eagle fighters from the United States were delivered to Israel in 1976.

The Kfir&#x27;s first recorded combat action took place on November 9, 1977, during an Israeli air strike on a training camp at Tel Azia, in Lebanon. The only air victory claimed by a Kfir during its service with the IAF occurred on June 27, 1979, when a Kfir C.2 shot down a Syrian MiG-21.

By the time of the Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1982 (&quot;Operation Peace for Galilee&quot;) the IAF was able to use both its F-15s and F-16s for air superiority roles, leaving the Kfirs to carry out unescorted strike missions. Shortly afterwards, all IAF C.2s began to be upgraded to the C.7 version, with enhanced weight performance, making the Kfir more suitable to its new fighter-bomber role. During the second half of the 1990s, the Kfirs were withdrawn from active duty in the IAF, after almost twenty years of continuous service.

Israel Aerospace Industries announced in August 2013 it will offer pre-owned Kfir fighter jets to foreign customers, with a 40-year guarantee. Unit price is reported to be $20 million. A few Eastern European and Latin American countries have expressed interest, Israel&#x27;s &quot;Globes&quot; business daily reported. By October 2013, Israel Aerospace Industries was in &quot;very advanced negotiations&quot; with at least two air forces interested in the Kfir Block 60. An aircraft can be delivered within one year, with two squadrons to be sold in two to three years. The Block 60 is offered with the Elta EL/M-2032 with open architecture avionics to allow a customer to install other systems. The sensor provides an all-aspect, look-down/shoot-down performance in air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, with the capability to simultaneously track up to 64 targets. The J79 has been overhauled to zero flight hours, and would need replacement after 1,600 hours.

===Foreign service===
Since the J79 turbojet engine is an U.S. design, although manufactured under license in Israel, all export sales of the Kfir are subject to prior approval being granted by the U.S. State Department, a fact that has limited the sale of the Kfir to foreign nations.

As of 2006, the IAI Kfir has been exported to Colombia, Ecuador, and Sri Lanka.

====Colombia====
As a result of a trade agreement between Colombia and Israel in 1989 the Colombian government bought a batch of 12 ex-IAF Kfir C.2s and one TC.2, which were delivered to the Colombian Air Force (&quot;FAC&quot;) in 1989–1990. Since then, all the C.2s have been upgraded to the C.7 variant. The &quot;FAC&quot; Kfirs have been widely used in ground-attack missions during counter-insurgency operations against Colombian terrorists. As of 2004 two aircraft had been lost in accidents.

In February 2008, Colombia signed a deal with the Israeli government for an additional 24 ex-IAF Kfir aircraft. It was estimated that these aircraft will most probably be upgraded by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to C.10 standard.

In June 2009, IAI delivered the first batch of upgraded Kfirs to the Colombian Air Force in a ceremony held at IAI&#x27;s facilities in Israel. In attendance at the ceremony was Juan Hurtado Cano, the Colombian Ambassador to Israel, high-ranking officers from the Colombian Air Force, and executives from the International Defense Cooperation Directorate of the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD-SIBAT). This was a part of a multi-year contract awarded in late 2007 and worth over $150 million to upgrade the existing Colombian Air Force Kfirs, and to supply additional jets. The additional Kfir jets, models C.10-C.12, have been upgraded and improved to include IAI&#x27;s latest technologies and products.

On July 20, 2009, a Kfir crashed near the city of Cartagena. The Israeli pilots operating the plane were unharmed in the incident, but the jet was destroyed. Israel Aerospace Industries said in a statement that the plane was flying a refresher flight, and that the aircraft didn&#x27;t come to a stop on the landing strip, landing outside it. The director of the Israel Aerospace Industries announced that an investigation into the incident had already begun and that a panel to probe the crash had been appointed. On July 22, 2009, IAI informed the Colombian Air Force that the accident was caused by an unspecified human error. As a result, IAI will replace the unit lost with another one and it will resume delivery to the Colombian Air Force.

On November 1, 2013, two Colombian Air Force IAI Kfirs intercepted Russian Air Force Tu-160s that had entered Colombian airspace. The Russian aircraft had taken off from Simón Bolívar International Airport Venezuela.

On October 10, 2017, Colombian IAI Kfirs were updated with the EL/M 2052 AESA Radar and incorporated the I-Derby-ER Active Air to Air Missile and the Python-5 Air to Air Infrared Missile

As of 2019, 23 Colombian IAI Kfirs remain in service.

====Ecuador====

In 1981, Ecuador and Israel signed a sales agreement for ten refurbished and new ex-IAF Kfir C.2s and two TC.2s, which were delivered to the Ecuadorian Air Force (&quot;FAE&quot;) in 1982–1983. The Kfirs formed the 2113rd Squadron (&quot;Lions&quot;) of the FAE&#x27;s 21st Fighter Wing, based at Taura AFB, on the Ecuadorian western lowlands.

The &quot;FAE&quot; Kfirs went into action during the 1995 Cenepa War between Ecuador and Peru. Relying on its fleet of subsonic A-37Bs for low-level ground-attack missions on Peruvian positions, the Ecuadorian Air Force held back its Mirage F.1s and Kfir C.2s for use as escorts and interceptors. On February 10, 1995, a Kfir C.2 shot down a Peruvian Air Force Cessna A-37B with a Shafrir 2 IR-homing AAM.

In 1996, with tensions still running high between Ecuador and Peru, the Ecuadorians acquired four additional Kfirs (three C.2 and one TC.2) after securing approval from the U.S. State Department.

In 1998, with its aging squadron of SEPECAT Jaguar fighter-bombers about to be withdrawn from active duty, Ecuador began talks with Israel for the sale of a new batch of eight Kfirs. Fearing an escalation of the arms race in South America (Peru had recently acquired 18 MiG-29s and 18 Su-25s from Belarus), the United States blocked the deal. As an alternative, Ecuador and Israel signed an agreement in 1999 for the delivery of two Kfir C.10s and for the conversion of an undisclosed number of the &quot;FAE&#x27;s&quot; original C.2s to the C.10 version, referred to in Ecuador as Kfir CE, featuring a Helmet Mounted Display System, and armed with Python 3 and Python 4 IR-homing AAMs.

By 2005, Ecuador had lost four Kfirs, including one TC.2, due to accidents since the aircraft entered service in 1982.

====Sri Lanka====
The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) acquired six Kfir C.2s and a single TC.2 in 1995–1996. A further nine aircraft had been added to the inventory by 2005, including four C.2s and four C.7s acquired in 2000. Currently the SLAF operates two TC.2s, two C.7s and six C.2s by the No. 10 &quot;Fighter&quot; Squadron. The SLAF used their Kfirs to carry out attacks against LTTE rebels during the Sri Lankan Civil War in Sri Lanka. Two Kfir C.7s were destroyed on the ground in an LTTE attack on SLAF Katunayake air base, part of Bandaranaike International Airport, on 24 July 2001. Three others were lost in non-combat related accidents during the Civil War period. None were lost in aerial combat. In March 2011, two Kfirs collided in mid-air during an airshow practice sortie.

On June 30, 2021, it was announced that the IAI will upgrade five Sri Lankan Kfirs for a return to service with new systems and sensors under a US$50 million contract.

====United States====
Between 1985 and 1989, the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps leased 25 examples of the Kfir C.1, which were officially designated F-21A and modified for use as unarmed adversaries: mock opponents in dissimilar air combat training (DACT). These aircraft had narrow-span canard foreplanes and two small rectangular strakes, one on either side of the nose, which considerably improved the aircraft&#x27;s maneuverability and handling at low speeds.

The 12 F-21 aircraft leased to the U.S. Navy, painted in a three-tone blue-gray &quot;ghost&quot; scheme, were operated by Fighter Squadron 43 (VF-43), based at NAS Oceana, Virginia. In 1988, they were returned and replaced by the F-16N. The 13 aircraft leased to the U.S. Marine Corps were operated by Marine Fighter Training Squadron 401 (VMFT-401), a 4th Marine Aircraft Wing/ Marine Corps Reserve squadron at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. In addition to the blue-gray painted aircraft, the USMC also had some F-21s painted in Israeli colors and desert &quot;flogger&quot; schemes (named because they were to represent the schemes often worn by Warsaw Pact MiG-23 &quot;Floggers&quot;). The Kfir was utilized because they both shared the common characteristic of being very fast-accelerating, as well as achieving a top speed of above Mach 2. The MiG-23 was targeted as the &quot;enemy&quot; aircraft because at this time the MiG-23 was being introduced in very large numbers, and was a very capable aircraft compared to earlier Soviet types. These USMC F-21 aircraft were replaced by F-5E aircraft when the F-21s were returned in 1989 (although this left the training units without any aircraft capable of accurately simulating the Mach 2+ and fast-accelerating MiG-23).

Six Kfirs are also used by the US firm Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), a civilian defense contractor that provides tactical adversary aircraft services to the US military. ATAC provides airborne tactical training, threat simulation, and research &amp; development. ATAC&#x27;s corporate headquarters and primary operating location is at Patrick Henry International Airport in Newport News, VA, with additional permanent operating locations at US Naval Air Stations and Marine Corps Air Stations in California, Nevada, Hawaii and Japan. ATAC also operates Hawker Hunter F.58s. On March 6, 2012, an ATAC Kfir, FAA registration N404AX, crashed while landing at NAS Fallon, Nevada after a flight supporting the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center. The pilot, a retired USN officer, was fatally injured.

===Potential users===

In the early 1990s, IAI was looking to export 40 Kfir-C fighters to the Republic of China (Taiwan) in a deal estimated to have been worth US$400 million to $1 billion; however, the deal ultimately fell through.

During 2013, the Argentine Air Force commenced negotiations with Israel for 18 Kfir Block 60 fighters as an alternative to another deal for 16 ex-Spanish Mirage F1 fighters. During mid-2014, industry sources claim IAI will &quot;soon&quot; receive an order from the Argentine Air Force for Kfir Block 60s after their purchase of surplus Spanish Mirage F1s failed.

==Variants==
* Kfir C.1: Basic production variant without canards.
** Kfir C.1P/Kfir Canard: Upgraded version of the Kfir C.1 meant to modify original airframes up to the C.2 standard. These aircraft had been modified and included fences on the air intakes and nose. These fences greatly improved the aircraft maneuverability and slow speed control. These aircraft also included flare/chaff dispensers.
*** F-21A Kfir: 25 upgraded Kfir C.1P aircraft, were leased to the USN and USMC for an aggressor role and were designated F-21A Lion. These aircraft were unarmed and had their internal guns removed.
* Kfir C.2: An improved Kfir that featured many aerodynamic improvements. Changes included &quot;dogtoothed&quot; leading edges on the wings, fences on the nose, and large fixed canards on the air intakes.
* Kfir TC.2: A two-seat training variant developed from the C.2. It has a longer and lowered nose to improve the pilot&#x27;s view.
* Kfir RC.2: Reconnaissance version of the C.2 commonly known as the Kfir Tzniut due to the Tzniut camera nose being fitted to it.
* Kfir C.7: Vastly modified variant. Most if not all C.2 aircraft were modified to this variant. It included an improved J79-GE-J1E engine that provided an additional of thrust at full afterburner (and as a result increasing the Maximum Take-off Weight by ), 2 more hardpoints under the air intakes, better avionics such as a MFD.
* Kfir TC.7: A two-seat training variant developed from the C.7.
* Kfir C.9: Proposal for Argentina powered by Atar 9K50. Cancelled. Later developed as South Africa&#x27;s Atlas Cheetah
* Kfir C.10: A variant developed especially for export. The most important change is the adaptation of the Elta EL/M-2032 radar. Other changes include HMD capability and two 127×177mm MFDs. This variant is also known as Kfir CE ( Ecuadorean version ) and Kfir COA (Colombian version).
* Kfir TC.10: Upgraded version of the TC.7 for the Colombian Aerospace Force.
* Kfir C.12: Upgraded version of the C.7 for the Colombian Aerospace Force, a C.10 without the Elta EL/M-2032 radar.
* Kfir Block 60: Upgraded version of the C.10, The main feature of this variant is the use of AESA radar, proposed to the Bulgarian Air Force and Colombian Aerospace Force. Argentina is reported to be interested in a US$500m deal for eighteen Block 60 to replace its planned acquisition of second-hand Mirage F1M from Spain.
* Kfir NG: Upgraded version, short for Next-Generation. Offered to current and former operators Colombia, Ecuador and Sri Lanka, revealed at Paris Air Show 2019.

<text>Bourg-Saint-Andéol (; ) is a commune in the Ardèche department in the Rhône Valley in southern France.

==Geography==
It lies directly along the river Rhône at the southeast end of the department south of the smaller town Viviers, from Pierrelatte eastwards across the river in the &quot;département&quot; Drôme and from Pont-Saint-Esprit, in the north of the &quot;département&quot; of Gard. to the south-west starts the nearby Ardèche Gorges in Saint-Martin-d&#x27;Ardèche.

==History==
The Gallic settlement on a rocky peak over the Rhône was called &quot;Bergoiata&quot;. Near the town is a sculpted bas relief of the god Mithras. It acquired its present name after Saint Andeolus, the &#x27;apostle of the Vivarais&#x27;, a disciple of St. Polycarp, supposedly arriving from Asia Minor, who evangelized the area under Emperor Septimius Severus, and was martyred in 208. The region was named &quot;Helvia&quot; in Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, with Alba-la-Romaine as capital city, then Vivarais from the mediaeval times after the see of Viviers, a region of Languedoc province during Ancien Régime until &quot;départements&quot; were created at the French Revolution. Due to the citizen&#x27;s engagement for the Revolution, the town&#x27;s name rejected a while the little known saint and was named &quot;Bourg-sur-Rhône&quot;. (At the Napoleonic times, Andéol had already been brought in back...)
It had been the seat of a &quot;bailli&quot; (royal magistrate). And the bishop of Viviers had settled several decades in Renaissance times in the city (the Bishops&#x27; Palace). It is the seat of the mother houses of the Congregation of the Presentation of Mary and of the Religious Congregations of the Presentation.

The city had grown and become one of the most important towns of county Vivarais due to its position on the Rhône (boatmen &quot;mariniers du Rhône&quot;, trade and business in hide, fabric, wine, oil). Several patricians&#x27; houses are still to be seen in the centre of the city (although a part of it was bombed by Allied forces at the end of World War II, missing the hanging bridge - which was replaced afterwards by the existing one).

==Economy==
Bourg-Saint-Andéol is the shopping center for surrounding villages. In the mid 80es, several factories closed and economy almost drowned (ceramics). Nowadays, Pierrelatte with the site of Tricastin, first atomic energy plant in France, makes that many residents of Bourg-Saint-Andéol earn their livelihood by working over the Rhône. Another noticeable economical source of the area - already a typical mediterranean zone - is wine, with the Côtes du Rhône &quot;méridionales&quot; (southern) gathering four other &quot;communes&quot; around the city (Saint-Marcel-d&#x27;Ardèche, Saint-Just and Saint-Martin-d&#x27;Ardèche). An oil mill has been recently re-established for olive harvests in the area.

==Tourism==
The area is popular for tourism and summer homes, and the city is known as having the richest cultural heritage in Ardèche: there are many dolmens in the &quot;Bois du Laoul&quot; forest and a sculpture of Mithra near the Vauclusian springs of the Tourne. Several former noble or grand-bourgeois 18th century places are regularly used for local and visitors during summer season. A mediaeval fort with embellishments dating from the 15th and 17th century, the entire construction a classified historical monument, the Bishops&#x27; palace of Bourg-Saint-Andéol with inside the museum René Margotton, front of Rhône, is one of the largest and most complex in the Vivarais region. 
==Population==

<doc id="489375" wikidata="Q390275" url="?curid=489375" title="Bran Castle">
<text>Bran Castle (; or ; ) is a castle in Bran, southwest of Brașov. The castle was built by Saxons in 1377 who were given the privilege by Louis I of Hungary. It is a national monument and landmark in Transylvania. The fortress is on the Transylvanian side of the historical border with Wallachia, on road DN73.

Marketed outside Romania as Dracula&#x27;s Castle, it is presented as the home of the title character in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;. There is no evidence that Stoker knew anything about this castle, which has only tangential associations with Vlad the Impaler, voivode of Wallachia, whose byname &#x27;Drăculea&#x27; resembles that of Dracula. Stoker&#x27;s description of Dracula&#x27;s crumbling fictional castle also bears no resemblance to Bran Castle.

The castle is now a museum dedicated to displaying art and furniture collected by Queen Marie. Tourists can see the interior on their own or by a guided tour. At the bottom of the hill is a small open-air museum exhibiting traditional Romanian peasant structures (cottages, barns, water-driven machinery, etc.) from the Bran region.

==History==
===Wooden castle of the German Order===
In 1212, the Teutonic Order built the wooden castle of Dietrichstein as a fortified position in the Burzenland at the entrance to a mountain pass through which traders had travelled for more than a millennium. This castle was destroyed by the Mongols in 1242.

The castle&#x27;s original name, Dietrichstein or &quot;lapis Theoderici&quot; in Latin, lit. &quot;Dietrich&#x27;s Stone&quot;, seems to have been derived from the &quot;Comthur&quot; (Commander) and regional Preceptor, &quot;frater Theodericus&quot;, mentioned in a 1212 document. This Dietrich is the probable builder of the castle. A 1509 document confirms that the Törzburg county had once belonged to Commander Dietrich of the Teutonic Order.

===Stone castle of the Kronstadt Saxons===
The first documented mention of Bran Castle is the act issued by Louis I of Hungary on 19 November 1377, giving the Saxons of Kronstadt (modern Brașov) the privilege to build the stone castle at their own expense and labour force; the settlement of Bran began to develop nearby. In 1438–1442, the castle was used in defense against the Ottoman Empire, and later became a customs post on the mountain pass between Transylvania and Wallachia. Although many castles of the time belonged to members of the nobility, it has been established that Bran Castle was built almost exclusively for fortification and protection of German colonists in Transylvania. It is believed the castle was briefly held by Mircea the Elder of Wallachia (r. 1386–95, 1397–1418) during whose period the customs point was established. The Wallachian ruler Vlad Țepeș (Vlad the Impaler; 1448–1476) does not seem to have had a significant role in the history of the fortress, although he passed several times through the Bran Gorge. At some point, Bran Castle belonged to the Hungarian kings, but due to the failure of King Vladislas II (r. 1471–1516) to repay loans, the city of Brașov regained possession of the fortress in 1533.

In 1530, Moise of Wallachia, Voivode of Wallachia, sent an army to capture the castle, but the Székely soldiers led by the castle lord Dénes defended the building, thereby forcing the Wallachian army to retreat.

Bran played a militarily strategic role up to the mid-18th century.

===Royal residence and aftermath===
With the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost Transylvania, and the castle became a royal residence within the Kingdom of Romania after being given to the royal house by the Saxons of Kronstadt-Braşov, who had no more use for it and no interest in financing the time-damaged property. It became the favorite home and retreat of Marie of Romania, who ordered its extensive renovation conducted by the Czech architect . The castle was inherited by her daughter Princess Ileana who ran a hospital there in World War II. It was later seized by the communist regime with the expulsion of the royal family in 1948.

In 2005 the Romanian government passed a law allowing restitution claims on properties illegally expropriated, such as Bran, and thus a year later ownership of the castle was awarded to Archduke Dominic of Austria, a son of Princess Ileana.

On 18 May 2006, after a period of legal proceedings, the castle was legally returned to the children of Princess Ileana. However, through the Ministry of Culture, the Romanian state was also to administer it for the next three years.

In September 2007 an investigation committee of the Romanian Parliament stated that the retrocession of the castle to Archduke Dominic was illegal, as it broke the Romanian law on property and succession. However, in October 2007 the Constitutional Court of Romania rejected the parliament&#x27;s petition on the matter. In addition, an investigation commission of the Romanian government issued a decision in December 2007 reaffirming the validity and legality of the restitution procedures used and confirming that the restitution was made in full compliance with the law.

On 18 May 2009 administration of Bran Castle was transferred from the government to Archduke Dominic and his sisters, Archduchess Maria Magdalena and Archduchess Elisabeth. On 1 June 2009, the Habsburgs opened the refurbished castle to the public as the first private museum in the country and presented a joint strategic concept in collaboration with Bran village to maintain their prominent role in the Romanian tourist circuit and to safeguard the economic base in the region.

==&quot;Dracula&#x27;s Castle&quot;==
Though many myths have been connected to him in connection with the Dracula myth, most historians agree that Vlad III Dracula, also known as Vlad the Impaler, never set foot in Castle Bran, which was neither a friendly place for him to visit nor under his rule. It was once believed that he was imprisoned there after he was captured by the Hungarians in 1462, but historians now conclude that he was imprisoned in a fortress in Budapest.

=== Connection to Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; ===

Bran Castle is not mentioned in the novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, and the novel&#x27;s description of the castle does not match Bran Castle. The claimed connection between the castle and the Dracula legend is tourism-driven.

During Stoker&#x27;s research on the region of Transylvania, he came across accounts of the atrocities committed by Vlad III, and used the Dracula name after reading on the subject; but his inspiration for Dracula was not solely based on the historical figure. It is largely due to American cinema that Vlad III is considered the inspiration for the Dracula character.

==Other mentions in popular culture==

Most of Laurie R. King&#x27;s novel &quot;Castle Shade&quot; (2022), part of her series about Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell, is set in and near Bran Castle in 1925.

<doc id="489376" wikidata="Q943459" url="?curid=489376" title="Manat (goddess)">
<text> (  , or Old Arabic manawat; also transliterated as &quot;) was a pre-Islamic Arabian goddess worshipped in the Arabian Peninsula before the rise of Islam and the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the 6/7th century. She was among Mecca&#x27;s three chief goddesses, alongside her sisters, Allat and Al-‘Uzzá, and among them, she was the original and the oldest.

== Etymology ==
There are two possible meanings of the goddess&#x27; name. The first is that it was likely derived from the Arabic root &quot;mana&quot;&quot;, thus her name would mean &quot;to mete out&quot;, or alternatively &quot;to determine&quot;, the second is that it derives from the Arabic word &quot;maniya&quot; meaning &quot;fate&quot;. Both meanings are fitting for her role as goddess of fate and destinies. Pre-Islamic theophoric names including Manāt are well attested in Arab sources.

== Worship ==

Considered a goddess of fate, fortune, time, and destiny, she was older than both Al-Lat and Al-‘Uzzá as theophoric names including hers, such as Abd-Manah or Zayd-Manah, are found earlier than names featuring Al-Lat&#x27;s or Al-‘Uzzá&#x27;s. But aside from being the most ancient of the three chief goddesses of Mecca, she was also very possibly among the most ancient of the Semitic pantheon as well.

Her now-lost major shrine was between Mecca and Medina on the coasts of the Red Sea, likely in al-Mushallal where an idol of her was erected. The Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj were considered to be among the most devoted of tribes to the goddess, so much that the place to make sacrifices to her was commonly referred to by its significance to the Khazraj, as known from a poem most likely written by Abd-al-‘Uzza ibn-Wadi‘ah al-Muzani:
Her early representations included a wooden portrait of her, which was covered with sacrificial blood, but the most notable representation of her was her idol erected in al-Mushallal. When pre-Islamic Arabians would pilgrim to al-Mushallal, they would shave their head and stand in front of Manāt&#x27;s idol for a while. They would not consider their pilgrimage complete without visiting her idol.

An idol of her was also likely among the 360 idols in the Kaaba. According to Ibn al-Kalbi, when worshipers would circumambulate the Kaaba, they would chant her name along with that of her sisters, al-Lat and al-Uzza, seeking their blessings and intercession.

Manat was also thought to watch over graves, as indicated by a tomb inscription reading &quot;And may Dushara and Manat and Qaysha curse anyone who sells this tomb or buys it or gives it in pledge or makes a gift of it or leases it or draws up for himself any document concerning it or buries in it anyone apart from the inscribed above&quot;.

== After the rise of Islam ==
=== Mention in the &quot;Satanic&quot; Verses ===

The different versions of the story are all traceable to one single narrator, Muhammad ibn Ka&#x27;b, who was two generations removed from biographer Ibn Ishaq. In its essential form, the story reports that Muhammad longed to convert his kinsmen and neighbors of Mecca to Islam. As he was reciting these verses of Sūrat an-Najm, considered a revelation from the angel Gabriel,

: &quot;Have you thought of al-Lāt and al-‘Uzzá&quot;
: &quot;and Manāt, the third, the other?&quot;
: (Quran 53:19–20)

Satan tempted him to utter the following line:

: &quot;These are the exalted &quot;gharāniq&quot;, whose intercession is hoped for.&quot; (In Arabic تلك الغرانيق العلى وإن شفاعتهن لترتجى.)

The line was taken from the religious chant of Meccan polytheists who prayed to the three goddesses while circumambulating the Ka&#x27;aba.

== Destruction of Temple ==
In the same month as the mission of Khalid ibn al-Walid to destroy al-Uzza and the Suwa, Sa‘d bin Zaid al-Ashhali was sent with 20 horsemen to Al-Mashallal to destroy an idol called Manāt, worshipped by the polytheist Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj tribes of Arabia. According to legend, a black woman appeared, naked with disheveled hair, wailing and beating on her chest. Sa‘d immediately killed her, destroyed the idol and broke the casket, returning at the conclusion of his errand.

The group who carried out this raid were formerly devoted worshippers of al-Manat. According to some sources, among them &quot;ibn Kalbi&quot;, Ali was sent to demolish al-Manat; however, Sir William Muir claims there is more evidence to suggest that the raid was carried out by Sa&#x27;d, and that it would have been out of character for Muhammad to send Ali, since Muhammad had been sending former worshippers to demolish idols.

=== Somnath temple ===
The attack on Somnath temple in India in 1024 by Mahmud of Ghazni may have been inspired by the belief that an idol of Manat had been secretly transferred to the temple. According to the Ghaznavid court poet Farrukhi Sistani, who claimed to have accompanied Mahmud on his raid, Somnat (as rendered in Persian) was a garbled version of &quot;su-manat&quot; referring to the goddess Manat. According to him as well as a later Ghaznavid historian Abu Sa&#x27;id Gardezi, the images of the other goddesses were destroyed in Arabia but the one of Manat was secretly sent away to Kathiawar (in modern Gujarat) for safe keeping. Since the idol of Manat was an aniconic image of black stone, it could have been easily confused with a lingam at Somnath. Mahmud is said to have broken the idol and taken away parts of it as loot and placed it on the ground so that people would walk on it. In his letters to the Caliphate, Mahmud exaggerated the size, wealth and religious significance of the Somnath temple, receiving grandiose titles from the Caliph in return.

<text>Bran, also known as miller&#x27;s bran, is the component of a cereal grain consisting of the hard layersthe combined aleurone and pericarpsurrounding the endosperm. Corn (maize) bran also includes the pedicel (tip cap). Along with the germ, it is an integral part of whole grains, and is often produced as a byproduct of milling in the production of refined grains. Bran is highly nutritious, but is difficult to digest due to its high fiber content; its high fat content also reduces its shelf life as the oils/fats are prone to becoming rancid. As such, it is typically removed from whole grain during the refining processe.g. in processing wheat grain into white flour, or refining brown rice into white rice.

Bran is present in cereal grain, including rice, corn (maize), wheat, oats, barley, rye, and millet. Bran is not the same as chaff, which is a coarser, scaly material surrounding the grain, but does not form part of the grain itself, and which is indigestible by humans.

==Composition==

Bran is particularly rich in dietary fiber and essential fatty acids, and contains significant quantities of starch, protein, vitamins, and dietary minerals. It is also a source of phytic acid, an antinutrient that prevents nutrient absorption.

The high oil content of bran makes it subject to rancidification, one of the reasons that it is often separated from the grain before storage or further processing. Bran is often heat-treated to increase its shelf life.

== Rice bran ==
Rice bran is a byproduct of the rice-milling process (the conversion of brown rice to white rice), and it contains various antioxidants. A major rice bran fraction contains 12%–13% oil and highly unsaponifiable components (4.3%). This fraction contains tocotrienols (a form of vitamin E), gamma-oryzanol, and beta-sitosterol; all these constituents may contribute to the lowering of the plasma levels of the various parameters of the lipid profile. Rice bran also contains a high level of dietary fiber (beta-glucan, pectin, and gum). It also contains ferulic acid, which is also a component of the structure of nonlignified cell walls. Some research suggests, though, inorganic arsenic is present at some level in rice bran. One study found the levels to be 20% higher than in contaminated drinking water.

==Uses==

Bran is often used to enrich breads (notably muffins) and breakfast cereals, especially for the benefit of those wishing to increase their intake of dietary fiber. Bran may also be used for pickling (&quot;nukazuke&quot;) as in the &quot;tsukemono&quot; of Japan. Rice bran in particular finds many uses in Japan, where it is known as &quot;nuka&quot; (; ). Besides using it for pickling, Japanese people add it to the water when boiling bamboo shoots, and use it for dish washing. In Kitakyushu City, it is called &quot;jinda&quot; and used for stewing fish, such as sardines.

Bran oil may be also extracted for use by itself for industrial purposes (such as in the paint industry), or as a cooking oil, such as rice bran oil.

 Wheat bran is useful as feed for poultry and other livestock, as part of a balanced ration with other inputs. Wheatings, a milling byproduct comprising mostly bran with some pieces of endosperm also left over, are included in this category.

Bran was found to be the most successful slug deterrent by BBC&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot;. It is a common substrate and food source used for feeder insects, such as mealworms and waxworms. Wheat bran has also been used for tanning leather since at least the 16th century.

==Research==

As with cereal fibers and whole grain consumption, bran is under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect chronic diseases.

==Stability==
Commonly, bran is heat-treated with the intention of slowing undesirable rancidification, but a 2003 study of heat-treatment of oat bran found a complex pattern whereby increasingly intense heat treatment reduced the development of hydrolytic rancidity and bitterness with time, but increased oxidative rancidity. The authors recommended that heat treatment should be sufficient to achieve selective lipase inactivation, but not so much as to render the polar lipids oxidizable upon prolonged storage.

<text>The Acura TL is a car that was manufactured by Acura, the North American luxury division of Honda. It was introduced in 1995 to replace the Acura Vigor and was badged for the Japanese-market from 1996 to 2000 as the Honda Inspire and from 1996 to 2004 as the Honda Saber. The TL was Acura&#x27;s best-selling model until it was outsold by the MDX in 2007. In 2005, it ranked as the second best-selling luxury sedan in the United States behind the BMW 3 Series, but sales decreased after the 2008 model year. Four generations of the Acura TL were produced, with the final generation premiering in 2008 for the 2009 model year, and ending production in 2014, when it was replaced together with the TSX by the TLX.

==First generation (UA1–UA3; 1996–1998)==
The TL, &quot;Touring Luxury,&quot; debuted for the 1996 model year with the 2.5 TL available with the 2.5 L 176 hp (131 kW) SOHC 20-valve 5-cylinder engine from the Vigor, and the 3.2 TL using the 3.2 L 200 hp (149 kW) SOHC 24v V6 from the second-generation Acura Legend. The model with the 2.0-liter inline-five was not offered in the US market. The debut of the TL signaled Acura&#x27;s shift from traditional vehicle names to alphanumeric designations; by replacing recognizable names such as &quot;Vigor&quot; and &quot;Legend&quot; with a letter designations, the luxury maker hoped to focus consumer attention on the Acura name. The TL was the first Acura model to adopt the new naming scheme.

The 2.5 TL was positioned as the sporty model, with the 3.2 TL focusing more upon a luxurious ride. Moreover, the added power in the 3.2 TL gave it better acceleration. Both engines were mounted in a front-rear, or longitudinal position. This contrasted with the more typical transverse engine mount style, and was intended to provide better weight distribution and reduce nose dive. The engine mount design resulted in an elongated hood for the first-generation TL, a shorter front overhang and longer wheelbase, fitting for a near-luxury car. The inline-5 engine in the 2.5 TL competed with similar 5-cylinder engines offered in Audi and Volvo models.

The first 1996 Acura TL was manufactured at Sayama, Japan on March 28, 1995. Sales of the 2.5 TL began in spring 1995, but the 3.2 TL was delayed until fall because of a U.S.-Japan trade dispute. The U.S. government had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on higher-priced Japanese cars in response a growing U.S.-Japan trade deficit. Ultimately a deal was reached which avoided the tariffs.

The first-generation Acura TL had standard features including dual airbags, anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control, a cassette/CD player sound system, and power windows and locks. Leather was standard on the more upscale 3.2 TL, while the 2.5 TL featured a firmer suspension setup. Like its predecessor, the Vigor, this generation TL was a 4-door pillared hardtop, with frameless windows.

===1997===
In 1997, Acura added a standard power moonroof to all TL models. Additionally, all Acura TLs received a variable-speed intermittent wiper setting. The 3.2 TL had 205/65/15 tires and a V6 motor. The sport-targeted, 5-cylinder 2.5 TL was further fitted with new alloy wheels.

===1998===
For 1998, Acura made several previously-optional features standard on the 2.5 TL. 1998 was the last year of TL production in Japan, as the model was being redesigned for production in the United States.
==Second generation (1999; UA4, UA5)==
In 1998, Honda revealed the TL-X concept car, showing a preview of the second-generation TL which would debut in fall of that year. The second-generation TL (now called 3.2 TL) was derived from the US-market Honda Accord platform. It was available with a newly designed 3.2 L 225 hp (168 kW) SOHC VTEC &quot;J32&quot; V6 mated to a four-speed electronic automatic transmission with SportShift.

The second-generation 3.2 TL (the 2.5 was dropped) was built in Marysville, Ohio, at Marysville Auto Plant, alongside the Honda Accord. These cars were imported into Japan and sold as the Honda Inspire in the &quot;Honda Clio&quot; dealer network, and as the Honda Saber in the &quot;Honda Verno&quot; dealer network. The main difference between the two cars were the front grille; the Inspire and Saber were also available with a 2.5 L Honda J-series V6 exclusive to the Japanese market.

The first 1999 Acura TL was assembled on August 4, 1998. The only option on the sedan was a CD-based navigation system. The 1999 TL&#x27;s navigation system stored the maps in zones; there were 5 different zones for the U.S. Starting with this generation, cabin air filters (also known as pollen filters) located behind the glove compartment were installed as standard equipment.

===2000===
In the second year of production, the Acura TL was given a few more features, including a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. The added gear allowed for slightly better fuel economy and acceleration when compared to the previous 4-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. With this model, if the driver forgets the 1-2 shift, the computer will take over when in sport mode and do the 1-2 up and down shifts, unlike the 4-speed 1999 model. In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission was very unreliable: as the third gear clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally. The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come to a screeching halt, even at freeway speeds. This problem was highlighted in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in September 2002. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; took note and gave the TL and CL the &quot;black spot,&quot; the worst rating for transmission reliability. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to 7 years or on American models. A class-action lawsuit was settled to extend the transmission warranty for U.S. owners or entities to 7.75 years for all models made from 1998 to 2002, and some 2003 models by VIN; however, Canadian owners&#x27; warranties were not extended. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again. Transmissions replaced from March 2005 and later include a redesigned third gear clutch pack reported to fix the problem.

Other notable changes included the addition of side impact airbags for the front passengers and a change of format for the navigation system. The 2000 TL switched from a CD database to a DVD-based navigation system. The entire continental United States became accessible with the navigation system, and it was possible to drive from one coast to the other.

===2001===
For the 2001 model year, Acura introduced the new CL Type S (2001-2003) which was a quicker model of the Acura CL (1996-2003). While it was mechanically identical to the TL, its sales never came close to that of its sibling model, and as a result, it was discontinued in May 2003. The 2001 model received a redesigned cupholder insert. The automatic transmissions in these cars were also defective. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to or 7.75 years for all 1999 - 2002 and 2003 partial per VIN. Acura dealers replace the transmissions under warranty. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again. Transmissions replaced in March 2005 and later include a redesigned third gear clutch pack reported to fix the problem.

Several models in the 2002–2003 years were the subject of a safety recall in July 2009 for injuries reported by faulty driver&#x27;s side airbag inflators. In February 2010, another recall was issued for the same problem.

===2002===
In March 2001 for the 2002 model year, the TL got a minor makeover, with a refreshed front fascia, redesigned taillights, a 6 CD in-dash changer as well as a few other features.

==== Type-S ====
A Type-S model was also added, adding 35 hp (26 kW) for a total of at 6100 rpm and of torque at 3500-5500 rpm. It also featured wheels, firmer seats and suspension. A large percentage of these vehicles exhibited problems with the automatic transmission necessitating replacement. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to or 7.75 years for all 1999-2002 models and 2003 partial per VIN. Acura dealers replace the transmissions under warranty. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again. Transmissions replaced March 2005 and later include a redesigned third gear clutch pack reported to fix the problem.

===2003===
Only minor changes occurred for this model year in order to make way for a redesign. One odd and notable addition to only the 2003 model year was the addition of a General Motors OnStar subscription cellular telephone and navigation assistance service to the DVD GPS navigation system option. These were separate independent systems, each with their own GPS receivers. The OnStar system was based on a dated Motorola analog cellular technology operating over 1G AMPS. Because of this and the failure of Acura to offer a digital upgrade, the TL OnStar system became defunct in 2009 when US carriers were allowed to turn off analog AMPS cell tower equipment.

== Third generation (UA6 2004–2008, UA7 2007-2008 Type S) ==
=== 2004 ===


In October 2003, the third-generation Acura TL (the 3.2 moniker was dropped) was released for sale in North America. Developed mainly in the United States by a team led by Erik Berkman, with bodywork by American Honda designer Jon Ikeda, the new TL was built in Marysville, Ohio, and was derived from the seventh generation US-market Honda Accord. 

Starting with this generation, this model was not sold in Japan, with the Honda Inspire instead holding the position of entry-level luxury sedan below the Honda Legend. The Inspire of this era was instead sold as the seventh generation North American-spec Honda Accord.

It is powered by a – later revised to based on the new SAE measurement standard for horsepower – and of torque, 3.2 L 24 valve SOHC VTEC V6 mated to either a &quot;SportShift&quot; manually controllable 5-speed automatic with or 6-speed manual. Manual transmission models featured Brembo 4-piston front brake calipers, a Torsen-type limited-slip differential, stiffer anti-roll bars front and rear and performance tires at no additional cost.

In March 2004, Honda began offering a factory-sanctioned &quot;tuner package&quot; version of the TL called the TL A-SPEC. This version featured a suspension tuned by Makoto Tamamura, an indication of the TL A-SPEC&#x27;s aggressive engineering. In addition, an underbody kit, spoiler, limited edition A-SPEC steering wheel, &quot;A-SPEC&quot; badge on the back, and wheels are standard. When installed at purchase, the car&#x27;s 4-year/ warranty applied to the package as well.

The third-generation TL was also the first car in the American market to include a 6-disc DVD-Audio system, output through an 8-speaker 225-watt system, engineered by Panasonic and tuned by Grammy Award-winning sound engineer Elliot Scheiner. The system also plays back CDs as well as DTS audio discs, CD-Audio, CD-Rs and CD-RWs but not MP3s. In the United States, all models were also equipped with a Bluetooth HandsFree Link (HFL) system, integrated with the audio system, to allow for hands-free usage of one&#x27;s cell phone (provided the phone also supports Bluetooth and is compatible with the HFL&#x27;s hands-free profile). In Canada, the HFL feature was not available on the base model (standard with A-Spec, Technology, and Navigation packages), though the 2005 model year saw HFL becoming standard in all Canadian models. With the built-in XM Radio tuner, owners can elect to pay a monthly subscription after the complimentary 3-month subscription expires from Acura for XM radio, which provides over 100 digital channels via satellite.

With the optional Alpine-designed navigation system, the third-generation TL can also accept voice commands like &quot;find nearest police station&quot; or &quot;go home.&quot; The DVD navigation system features an touchscreen LCD, which allows for easy viewing of the road ahead. DVDs with new road information for the navigation system were made annually until 2014.

The JDM Honda Inspire debuted around four and a half months earlier (on June 11, 2003) and marked the branching out of the TL line from the Inspire. The Inspire is basically a seventh-generation US-market Honda Accord V6 with minor trim changes, and the addition of Variable Cylinder Management, which shuts off half of the engine when not needed to boost fuel economy. The Saber was discontinued and the new Inspire is being sold at Clio, Primo, and Verno dealerships.

The TL became Acura&#x27;s best-selling luxury sedan in 2004 with more than 79,000 sold that year.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found the Acura TL had the second-lowest accident fatality rate among midsize luxury cars.

===2005===
The 2005 TL received a front passenger-side airbag cut-off switch and indicator and extra stitching on the front seats. There were also several unpublished minor changes made, such as changes in seat belt anchor mounts.

===2006===
The 2006 TL received a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) and a new engine management system to help reduce torque steer. The new horsepower rating of was due to a change in testing procedures, with the engine remaining technically the same since 2004.

===2007===

The 2007 Acura TL featured a slightly revised exterior as well as a revised interior with a new steering wheel, redesigned gauges, and footwell lighting, in addition to new interior and exterior colors. The 2007 TL (non Type-S) received suspension changes to improve ride comfort. Also new for the 2007 model year were LED turn signal repeaters on the side mirrors and fog lamps in the bumper. Prior to 2007, the fog lamps were integrated into the headlight housing; daytime running lights (DRLs) now occupy that space; since 2004, Canadian models had DRLs there rather than the fog lamps.

TL models with navigation models featured a new rear-view camera with the image displayed on the navigation screen, as well as XM NavTraffic. In addition to the new standard auxiliary audio jack, the sound system was MP3/WMA compatible and offers Dolby Pro Logic II decoding and speed-sensitive volume compensation. The manual transmission option was dropped from the base TL due largely to extremely low sales; only 1 out of 40 TLs sold across America were equipped with a manual gearbox.

Acura also introduced a new 5-speed automatic transmission for the 2007 and 2008 model year TLs. Changes included downshift &quot;rev matching&quot;, slightly altered gear ratios, and a different bellhousing. The transmission was identical between the base model and Type-S. The block on the base model&#x27;s 3.2-liter engine was changed to accommodate for the new bellhousing.

==== Type-S ====
The most notable addition during the 2007 revision was the return of the Type-S edition of the TL. The Acura TL Type-S received the Acura RL&#x27;s 3.5-liter &quot;J35A8&quot; V6 tuned to and 256 lb-ft of torque with either a 5-speed automatic with F1 style paddle shifters or a 6-speed manual transmission. The manual transmission includes a limited-slip differential.

Exterior differences included quad exhaust pipes, restyled rear lamps and front fascia, lip spoiler, wider side sills, Brembo brakes, 17-inch dark silver 10-spoke wheels, an upgraded suspension which included bigger stabilizer bars, lower front spring rates, upgraded bushings and dampers, a &quot;black chrome&quot; grille rather than the standard glossy grille, and exclusive Type-S badging, plus an exclusive new color option, Kinetic Blue Pearl.

The interior had Type-S badging on the steering wheel and headrests, more highly bolstered front seats, two-tone seats (only with the Ebony/Silver interior), metal racing pedals, carbon fiber trim, and red interior lighting as opposed to blue in the base TL. Touchscreen navigation was standard and the suspension has been firmed up. The only options are the aforementioned transmission and high-performance summer tires (Bridgestone Potenzas) rather than the standard all-season tires (Michelin Pilot MXM4s).

===2008===
The 2008 TL featured an improved new immobilizer system, and a separate TPMS warning lamp. The navigation system was updated to work in Hawaii, and the AcuraLink satellite capability was expanded to incorporate 76 markets, up from 38 markets in the 2007 model.

== Fourth generation (UA8 2009–2014, UA9 2009-2014 SH-AWD) ==

The first fourth-generation Acura TL rolled off the assembly line on September 23, 2008. Debuted for the 2009 model year, the new generation of TL featured a more aggressive interpretation of Acura&#x27;s latest styling vocabulary, known as &quot;Keen Edge Dynamic.&quot; Featured prominently on the front was the controversial &quot;Power Plenum&quot; upper grille. The size of the car was increased slightly, with the wheelbase being stretched to . The car was also longer overall, wider and taller. As a result, rear legroom improved by and rear shoulder room increased by . Structural rigidity was increased due to the use of high-strength steel in 47.6 percent of the chassis.

The base TL was front-wheel drive and is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 that makes and of torque, an increase of and over the previous 3.2-liter V6. The new TL SH-AWD (&quot;Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive&quot;) was the first TL to have an all-wheel drive system, and replaces the previous TL Type-S. It was given a more powerful 3.7-liter V6 that produces and of torque, an increase of and over the 3.5-liter V6 of the Type-S. Acura originally advertised it as having , but revised that claim without any explanation after a few months on the market. The 3.7-liter engine also uses VTEC variable-lift timing on both the intake and exhaust valves; the base TL and previous models only applied VTEC to the intake valves.

SH-AWD (&quot;Super Handling&quot; All Wheel Drive) is a multi-vectoring all wheel drive system designed more for performance than for simply providing traction in adverse circumstances. While cruising, the system sends 90% of the power to the front wheels and 10% to the rear wheels. Acceleration sends more torque on the rear wheels; the car can put up to 70% of the total available power to the rear wheels to assist with rapid acceleration, and of that 70%, 100% can be pushed to either the left or right wheel in order to assist the vehicle through a corner.

The brakes on the new TL were increased in size from the older front disc and rear disc to the now Ridgeline-sized front discs and rear disc, still incorporating an internal rear drum e-brake while maintaining hydraulic discs for the foot applied brakes. The bolt pattern on the car is no longer a 5 x but a 5 x for this generation.

The SH-AWD model also included some interior refinements over the base model, and is tuned for slightly firmer suspension and steering feedback. The exterior is visually distinguishable from the base model by an SH-AWD badge on the trunk, quad exhaust pipes (as opposed to dual exhaust on the base model) and larger air ducts in the front bumper to cool the larger brakes (the base model&#x27;s turn signal indicators in the bumper extend all the way to the center.) The TL rides on 245/50R17 tires, while the TL SH-AWD has 245/45R18 tires with optional 245/40ZR19 summer performance tires. Both models use electric power steering rather than hydraulic, and a revised five-speed automatic transmission (2012+ models received the 6-speed automatic) featuring shift paddles on the steering wheel is standard equipment for both models.

===2010===

For the 2010 model year, Acura announced that a 6-speed close-ratio manual transmission would be available for the SH-AWD model. For this manual transmission model, Acura designed a new self-adjusting dual-mass clutch system for increased holding power and improved modulation compared to the previous generation. Additional differences from the automatic transmission SH-AWD model include more aggressively tuned front dampers and springs, stiffer engine and transmission mounts, unique Electric Power Steering (EPS) tuning, hill start assist, and improved front/rear weight distribution.

The fourth generation Acura TL adds further electronic convenience items, now including a central multifunction display, an eight-speaker 276-watt audio system with a six-disc CD changer, XM Satellite Radio, USB port connectivity (including full iPod control support), and Bluetooth Audio (for streaming music from a cell phone). Both models offer an optional Technology Package, which includes premium Milano leather seats; Keyless Access ( unlock the doors, and start the engine without ever having to use your key, as long as it&#x27;s in your pocket or purse, or within range of the vehicle.), a joystick-based (no longer touchscreen) navigation system updated with a new full VGA display and the ability to provide weather information and traffic-based rerouting, and the Acura/ELS audio system with 10 speakers, 440 watts of power, DTS CD compatibility for 5.1 surround sound, DVD-A, as well as an internal hard drive with 13 GB of storage dedicated for audio. With the ELS audio system, audio CDs are automatically ripped to the hard drive upon insertion for future playback. The navigation system also stores its map data on the hard drive (as opposed to the previous model&#x27;s DVD-based storage), producing faster boot times.

===Technology Package===

====Audio====

=====Hard Drive=====
*13GB
*Only the contents of an Audio CD may be ripped to the HDD. Copying to the HDD from other recordable media or storage devices is not supported.

*Limited to 700 folders existing at the root of the storage device. Folder names appear as album names. Sub-folder navigation is not supported.
*Limited to 15,000 files

===2012===

For the 2012 model, Honda offered new front and rear styling, updating the controversial &quot;beak&quot; insert in the front grille by replacing it with a smaller insert that flows better with the headlights and creates a sleeker profile. Aside from cosmetic changes, the 2012 TL was equipped with Honda&#x27;s 6-speed automatic transmission to improve performance and efficiency. This transmission features downshift rev-matching with throttle blip and the ability to downshift two gears at a time. Additional new features include ventilated seats, new 60GB HDD, blind-spot information system, and upgraded wheels. The 2012 TL retains both the base 3.5L and the SH-AWD models&#x27; 3.7L engines but now gets two mpg more in the city () and three mpg more on the highway (), thanks to less engine friction and the 6-speed automatic transmission. The 6-speed manual transmission will continue to be offered. The 2012 model is also 3dB quieter on the highway.
===2013 Acura TL Special Edition===
It is a version of front-wheel-drive 2013 Acura TL with distinctive 10-spoke 18-inch alloy wheels, a color-matched deck lid spoiler, trunk-mounted Special Edition badging, Keyless Access System with Keyless Access Remote, pushbutton start, choice of 4 body colors (Bellanova White Pearl, Crystal Black Pearl, Graphite Luster Metallic and Silver Moon Metallic) matched with an Ebony interior leather upholstery with contrast stitching, Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifter system, 10-way adjustable power driver&#x27;s seat, an 8-way adjustable power front passenger&#x27;s seat, power moonroof, 276-watt audio system with eight speakers, dual-zone dual-mode automatic climate control system with automatic humidity control. The vehicle was produced using domestically and globally sourced parts at Honda of America Mfg., Inc., in Marysville, Ohio.

===Safety===
The Acura TL uses Honda&#x27;s Advanced Compatibility Engineering front end. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found the 2009-11 front-wheel drive TL models (SH-AWD models not included in study) to have an overall driver death of five deaths per million registered years.
:* 

===Production===
In early 2014, Honda announced it would be replacing the TL with the new Acura TLX sedan. Production of the TL ceased towards the end of 2014, with the 2015 TLX going on sale in the fall that same year.

==Sales figures==

=== How to Identify Chassis Codes ===
The chassis code is linked with the vehicle identification number (VIN). The number after the letters UA is the type and generation code:

*UA1 = 2.0 Inline 5 (not sold in the US)
*UA2 = 2.5 TL (1996-1998)
*UA3 = 3.2 TL (1996-1998)
*UA4 = 2.5 TL (1999-2003)
*UA5 = 3.2 TL-S (2002-2003)
*UA6 = 3.2 TL (2004-2008)
*UA7 = 3.5 TL-S (2007-2008)
*UA8 = 3.5 TL (2009-2014)
*UA9 = 3.7 TL SH-AWD (2009-2014)

<text>Richard O&#x27;Brien (born Richard Timothy Smith; 25 March 1942) is a British-New Zealand actor, writer, musician, and television presenter. He wrote the musical stage show &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; in 1973, which has since remained in continuous production. He also co-wrote the screenplay along with director Jim Sharman for the film adaptation, &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), and appeared on-screen as Riff Raff. The film became an international success and has received a large cult following. O&#x27;Brien co-wrote the musical &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; (1981) and appeared in the film as Dr. Cosmo McKinley.

From 1990 to 1993, O&#x27;Brien presented the Channel 4 game show &quot;The Crystal Maze.&quot; He also provides the voice of Lawrence Fletcher in the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; (2008–2015; 2025–present), as well as its two films (2011 and 2020). His other acting credits include &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980), &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (1985), &quot;Spice World&quot; (1997), &quot;Ever After&quot; (1998), &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2000), and &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Haunted Hills&quot; (2001).

After a long and successful career based in the United Kingdom, O&#x27;Brien gained dual citizenship with New Zealand in 2011, where he resided in Tauranga. O&#x27;Brien identifies himself as third gender and uses he/him pronouns.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Brien was born Richard Timothy Smith in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He emigrated with his family to Tauranga, New Zealand, at the age of 10, where his accountant father had purchased a sheep farm. He went to Tauranga Boys&#x27; College. It is known also that O&#x27;Brien attended Fairfield School in Hamilton, New Zealand in 1952. O&#x27;Brien worked as a barber at a barbershop in front of Hamilton&#x27;s Embassy Theatre. It was at this theatre where O&#x27;Brien attended many late-night picture shows and had the idea for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. He returned to England in 1964, after having learned how to ride horses (a skill which provided him with his break into the film industry as a stuntman in &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot;) and developing a keen interest in comic books and horror films. He launched his acting career using his mother&#x27;s maiden name, O&#x27;Brien as there was already an actor named Richard Smith. 

He says that his upbringing in New Zealand &quot;instilled him with egalitarian ideals that helped him transcend British class restrictions&quot;.

==Career==
To improve his acting skills, O&#x27;Brien took method acting classes, and then joined several stage productions as an actor. In 1970, he went into the touring production of &quot;Hair&quot; for nine months, and spent another nine months in the London production. In the summer of 1972, he met director Jim Sharman who cast him as an Apostle and Leper in the London production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. Sharman then cast O&#x27;Brien as Willie, the alien in his March 1973 production of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;The Unseen Hand&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs.

Sharman also helped make O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s draft of a gothic-themed, schlock-horror comic-book fantasy romp into a reality. Sharman suggested changing the working title from &quot;They Came from Denton High&quot;, and &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; opened at the Theatre Upstairs in June 1973. Within weeks it had become a box-office hit, moving from the Royal Court to the Classic Cinema, a cinema up for demolition on the King&#x27;s Road, then to the King&#x27;s Road Theatre (formerly a cinema known as the Essoldo) and eventually into the West End at the Comedy Theatre.

After seeing the second night&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; in the Theatre Upstairs, Jonathan King produced the original cast soundtrack in just over 48 hours during an off-stage weekend, and rushed it out on his UK Records label. He also became a 20% backer with producer Michael White, who put up the remaining 80%.

During this period, O&#x27;Brien and his wife Kimi Wong recorded and released pop singles under the name Kimi and Ritz.

===Later career===
O&#x27;Brien continued writing musicals with arranger Richard Hartley, including: &quot;T. Zee&quot; (1976), &quot;Disaster&quot; (1978), &quot;The Stripper&quot; (1982 – based on the Carter Brown novel and produced in Australia), and &quot;Top People&quot; (1984). O&#x27;Brien and Hartley also provided three songs for the film &quot;The Return of Captain Invincible&quot; (1983), starring Alan Arkin. O&#x27;Brien wrote his one-man revue &quot;Disgracefully Yours&quot; (1985) singing as Mephistopheles Smith.

O&#x27;Brien has appeared in &quot;Jubilee&quot; (1977), &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980), &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998), &quot;Ever After&quot; (1998) and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2000), among others. Additionally he guest starred in five episodes in the third series of the HTV dramatisation of &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, as the corrupt druid Gulnar. A music CD of the songs from &quot;Disgracefully Yours&quot; entitled &quot;Absolute O&#x27;Brien&quot; was released in 1998.

O&#x27;Brien became the presenter of UK Channel 4&#x27;s game show &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; in 1990, specialising in sardonic put-downs, occasional eccentricities and playing his harmonica at random intervals. The show ran from 1990 to 1995, with O&#x27;Brien presenting the first four series. It was regularly Channel 4&#x27;s highest-rated programme, reaching a peak of 7 million viewers for the 1993 Christmas special. O&#x27;Brien left &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; in 1993 after the fourth series; the show was then taken over by Edward Tudor-Pole.

In other roles, O&#x27;Brien has conceptualised and played the role of the Child Catcher in the West End theatre production of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;. He also occasionally performs cabaret-style music and comedy on stages around the world, singing songs from &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; among others. In 1995, he performed a select number of shows as the devilish charmer Mephistopheles Smith in a musical/comedy show he wrote entitled &quot;Disgracefully Yours&quot;, to which he later gave permission to be adapted into a musical, first by Eubank Productions for the Kansas City Fringe Fest in 2006, and more recently by Janus Theatre Company for the Edinburgh Fringe 2007, simply entitled &quot;Mephistopheles Smith&quot;. In late 2005, he appeared (as the spirit of the mirror) in the pantomime version of &quot;Snow White&quot;, which played at the Milton Keynes Theatre. In the summer of 2006, he played the Child Catcher in the Queen&#x27;s 80th birthday celebrations at Buckingham Palace.

O&#x27;Brien performed in &quot;Thank-You for the Music&quot;, a 90-minute ABBA documentary for ITV, directed by Martin Koch, who previously directed the musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; The documentary included a remake of the mini musical &#x27;&quot;The Girl with the Golden Hair&quot; which ABBA performed during their 1977 world tour and featured on &quot;&quot; (also 1977). The musical was performed at the Prince of Wales Theatre and featured O&#x27;Brien, Liz McClarnon and the Dynamos. He also hosted the 1993 Brit Awards.

A patron of the Five Stars Scanner Appeal, which benefits the Royal Manchester Children&#x27;s Hospital. From 2001 to 2006 he hosted the annual Transfandango, gala gathering of &quot;Dearhearts and Trans &#x27;n&#x27; Gentle People&quot; to raise money for the hospital. This has since been superseded by &quot;Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Halloween Party&quot;.

A script for another rumoured sequel entitled &quot;Revenge of the Old Queen&quot; of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;, has been circulated on the web and reproduced on various fan sites, although it has been officially denied as O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s work by his representatives. While he has worked on a screenplay by that title, it was never publicly released. He wrote the lyrics for &quot;The Stripper&quot; (based on the book by Carter Brown), a musical which had its British premiere at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch (London) on 28 August 2009.

In 2004, members of the Hamilton City Council in New Zealand honoured O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s contribution to the arts with a statue of Riff Raff, the character he played in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, on the site of the former Embassy Cinema.

In September 2007, he reprised his role as the Child Catcher for the final two weeks of the five year British run of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;. He then played the role in its Singapore engagement for the month of November, extended to 9 December. Also in December, he visited Hamilton, New Zealand, for &quot;An Evening With Richard O&#x27;Brien&quot;, with presenter Mark Sainsbury and director Fiona Jackson.

In December 2008, O&#x27;Brien donated his original script &quot;Pig in Boots&quot; to the Wireless Theatre Company, who converted it into an audio pantomime. The show was recorded live at the Headliners Comedy Club in front of a studio audience with live FX and music. The production was opened by an original interview with O&#x27;Brien. In October 2012, O&#x27;Brien judged &quot;Stage Fright&quot; with the Wireless Theatre Company as part of the London Horror Festival and performed an acoustic set of Rocky Horror songs.

In March 2012, he gave a performance of song and autobiographical stories, &quot;It&#x27;s Party Time with Richard O&#x27;Brien&quot; at the Hamilton Founders Theatre to celebrate his 70th birthday. In June 2012, he returned to Hamilton, New Zealand, to appear on stage as Fagin with the Hamilton Operatic Society&#x27;s production of &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the Founders Theatre.

O&#x27;Brien appeared in 2015 in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; in the West End in a limited 11-performance run.

In September 2016 O&#x27;Brien opened the second stage Embassy Park in Hamilton together with Mayor Julie Hardaker. In October 2016, he appeared as the Crystal Maze Computer in a one-off &quot;Celebrity Crystal Maze&quot; episode for the charity &#x27;Stand Up To Cancer&#x27; on Channel 4.

==Personal life==
In a 2009 interview, O&#x27;Brien spoke about an ongoing struggle to reconcile cultural gender roles and described himself as transgender or &quot;of a third gender&quot;. O&#x27;Brien stated, &quot;There is a continuum between male and female. Some are hard-wired one way or another, I&#x27;m in between.&quot; He expounded on this in a 2013 interview where he talked about using oestrogen for the previous decade, and that he views himself as 70% male and 30% female. In 2017, O&#x27;Brien caused controversy when he said that he supported the statements of Germaine Greer and Barry Humphries that transgender women are not real women. He offered his sympathy to the trans community. In a 2020 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, O&#x27;Brien was reported as stating: &quot;I think anybody who decides to take the huge step with a sex change deserves encouragement and a thumbs-up. As long as they&#x27;re happy and fulfilled, I applaud them to my very last day. But you can&#x27;t ever become a natural woman&quot;.

In June 2010, the media reported that O&#x27;Brien had been denied New Zealand citizenship owing to his being too old under the country&#x27;s immigration criteria. He commented, &quot;They build a statue of me and celebrate me as a New Zealander, but I have to go on my knees and do all sorts of things, and I&#x27;m probably too old.&quot; O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s application appeared to garner public support and the decision was later overturned on appeal. In August 2010, New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Dominion Post&quot; reported that O&#x27;Brien would be allowed residency and possibly citizenship as an &quot;exceptional&quot; case. According to the &quot;Waikato Times&quot;, he was officially registered as a New Zealand citizen on 14 December 2011.

On 16 August 2010, he appeared on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Cash in the Attic&quot;, where he donated the takings from his sale of memorabilia to the Royal Manchester Children&#x27;s Hospital, Manchester.

O&#x27;Brien has been married three times and has three children. He and actress Kimi Wong were married on 4 December 1971 and had a son Linus in May 1972. He has a son and daughter from his second marriage to designer Jane Moss.

On 7 July 2012, aged 70, he proposed to Sabrina Graf, aged 35, a native of Germany, whom he had been dating for three years. They married on 6 April 2013 at their home in Katikati, Bay of Plenty.

<doc id="489382" wikidata="Q710509" url="?curid=489382" title="Yo Hitoto">
<text>is a Japanese-Taiwanese pop singer.

==Early life==
Yo Hitoto&#x27;s mother was Japanese, and her father was a Taiwanese businessman (顏惠民). Tae Hitoto is her older sister. 

Her father died when she was very young, and her mother died when she was 16. Soon after she was born in Tokyo, Hitoto moved to Taipei, and after she completed kindergarten in Taipei, she moved back to Tokyo and she has lived there ever since. Hitoto is her mother&#x27;s maiden name, which she changed to when she moved back to Japan.

She can speak four languages: Japanese, English, Mandarin, and Taiwanese.

==Career==
To date, Hitoto has released eleven single CDs and four albums.

She graduated from the department of Environmental Information of Keio University and participated in the Keio University a cappella group, K.O.E., during her days as a student. She used to have live concerts on the street with fellow K.O.E. members before she met Yōichi Kitayama, a member of the famous Japanese a cappella group the Gospellers. Kitayama encouraged Hitoto to compose her own music. Before this encounter, she had been a backup singer for many other artists.

Hitoto&#x27;s debut single &quot;Morai naki&quot; propelled her to stardom, and her songs enjoy wide popularity. Her clear voice and singing style, which is compared to the style of folk songs of Okinawa, attract many fans. Her subsequent single &quot;Hanamizuki&quot;, released in 2004, was also a hit. The song was inspired by the events of the September 11 attacks in the United States.

In Taiwan she is known for singing a Taiwanese folk song (Bāng Chhun-hong), which was included in her second album, as part of a Kirin beer commercial aired in Taiwan.

Hitoto performed the theme song for the game &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot;.

Her latest compilation album sold over 700,000 copies (Triple-Platinum status in Japan), becoming her best selling album yet.

On March 11, 2022, Hitoto participated in the Shuichi &quot;Ponta&quot; Murakami tribute concert &quot;One Last Live&quot;, performing &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Hana Mizuki&quot;. She also joined Mie in performing the Pink Lady hit single &quot;Pepper Keibu&quot;.

===Film career===
In 2003 Hitoto debuted in her first film &quot;Café Lumière&quot;, as the lead character Yoko.

<doc id="489386" wikidata="Q898667" url="?curid=489386" title="Gallery Fake">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujihiko Hosono. It was firstly serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Big Comic Spirits&quot; from 1992 to 2005, with its chapters collected in 39 volumes. A two-chapter story and a four-chapter story were published in &quot;Weekly Big Comic Spirits&quot; in 2012 and 2016, respectively. A new serialization of &quot;Gallery Fake&quot; began in &quot;Big Comic Zōkan&quot; in 2017.

A 37-episode anime television series adaptation, animated by TMS Entertainment (episodes 1–25) and Tokyo Kids (episodes 26–37), was broadcast on TV Tokyo in 2005.

The manga has had over 10 million copies in circulation. In 1996, &quot;Gallery Fake&quot; received the 41st Shogakukan Manga Award for the general category.

==Plot==
On a wharf on Tokyo Bay is a small gallery named Gallery Fake. The owner of the gallery, Reiji Fujita, was once a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He was a learned curator with remarkable memory, keen aesthetic sense, great skill in restoration of paintings and knowledge of many languages, so he was called the &quot;Professor&quot;. However, because of trouble in the workplace, Fujita was forced to quit the museum. Now he is an art dealer who sells paintings, authentic and fake alike, sometimes at extraordinary prices, depending on the circumstances or the type of buyer. His motto is &quot;One without aesthetic sense can&#x27;t help being cheated out of his money. And by being deceived, one may learn to distinguish real ones from the counterfeit.&quot;

However, Fujita appreciates art and the artists who spent their lives creating it and does not try to deceive people by passing off fake paintings as genuine ones. He often helps the people he encounters, and other characters are attracted to him in spite of his sometimes gruff manner.

==Characters==
:
:An art dealer and a former curator for the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met). Those he worked with refer to him as &quot;Professor Fujita&quot;. He was forced to leave the Met by Max Watson when Fujita threatened to expose his shady dealings. Later, he established his own gallery on a wharf in Tokyo, Japan called Gallery Fake. He is an expert at painting restoration and an artist. He can usually determine if a painting is real or fake. He sometimes makes promises he cannot keep (mostly to Sara) and will sometimes deal on the black market to get certain artifacts. Fujita hates exercise and is easily exhausted from physical activity. Fujita is often the cause of Sara&#x27;s anger although he is very protective of her. He has a daughter from a previous relationship, named Elizabeth, his love child with Flora Joconda (a descendant of Mona Lisa). The two met when Fujita was a penniless young man and not yet an employee of the Met.
:
:Fujita&#x27;s very loyal assistant, who defends him if he is criticized. She accompanies Fujita on trips although she has little knowledge of art. She has a crush on him and is jealous if he visits Fei Cui. She adopts a stray cat which she has used to attack. She is an optimistic person and has a somewhat childish personality though she is persistent and unforgiving at times. Sara is a member of Kerabia&#x27;s royal family and hates war because it resulted in the death of her family.
:
:The director at Takada Art Museum. She thinks of Fujita as someone who is not helping the art world but destroying it. She states that Fujita is a cold-blooded scam artist. She is a stiff confident person and workaholic. She harbors some feelings for Fujita
:
:She owns a store called Jade, but is also a proclaimed jewel thief. She is obsessed with them and other precious items. She often calls Fujita to gloat about her latest stolen items. Sara sees her as a rival for Fujita&#x27;s attention. She has a volatile personality and her manservant, Menou, has said that Fei can be sunny one day and stormy the next. She sometimes has a problem with her eyes and fears she may go blind. Fujita claims that the jewels affect her eyes.
:
:Fei Cui&#x27;s middle-aged manservant who is also a masochist. He is happy when Fei Cui punishes him for misdemeanors.
:
:He is an associate of Fujita and helps him with his activities.
:
: He is an addicted treasure hunter and sometimes joins Fujita when his particular skills are required.
:
:An art expert and employee of the Met. He caused Fujita Reiji to resign from the Met after Fujita accused him of re-attributing paintings which were then sold at a reduced price to the art dealer Bill Travers.

<doc id="489387" wikidata="Q1155385" url="?curid=489387" title="Third Eye Blind">
<text>Third Eye Blind is an American rock band formed in San Francisco, California, in 1993. After years of lineup changes in the early and mid-1990s, the songwriting duo of Stephan Jenkins and Kevin Cadogan signed the band&#x27;s first major-label recording contract with Elektra Records in 1996. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1997, with the band largely consisting of Jenkins (vocals, rhythm guitar), Cadogan (lead guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), and Brad Hargreaves (drums). Shortly after the release of the band&#x27;s second album in 1999, &quot;Blue&quot;, with the same line-up, Cadogan was released from the band under controversial circumstances.

The band continued, but with many line-up changes and long gaps between album releases for the next 15 years. The band released &quot;Out of the Vein&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Ursa Major&quot; in 2009 with guitarist Tony Fredianelli, but parted ways with him shortly afterwards, leaving only Jenkins and Hargreaves as the remaining core members. The band&#x27;s lineup stabilized again in the mid-2010s, adding Kryz Reid (lead guitar), Alex Kopp (keyboards), and Alex LeCavalier (bass guitar). The new lineup led to increased output with less time between releases - &quot;Dopamine&quot; (2015), and a string of EPs, &quot;We Are Drugs&quot; (2016) and &quot;Thanks for Everything&quot; (2018). After Kopp was replaced by Colin Creev, sixth and seventh studio albums &quot;Screamer&quot; (2019) and &quot;Our Bande Apart&quot; (2021) were released.

The band found commercial success in the late 1990s, with &quot;Third Eye Blind&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; certified platinum six times and single platinum in the United States, respectively. Several songs were commercial successes as well, with &quot;Semi-Charmed Life&quot;, &quot;Jumper&quot;, and &quot;How&#x27;s It Going to Be&quot;, all reaching the Top 10 of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Never Let You Go&quot; reaching the Top 20. Third Eye Blind has sold around 12 million records worldwide.

==History==

===Formation and early years: 1990–1996===
The band&#x27;s origins trace back to the early 1990s, with frontman Stephan Jenkins writing music, but struggling to hold together a consistent musical lineup. Originally, Jenkins started his music career as one half of an interracial rap duo &quot;Puck and Natty&quot; with musician Herman Anthony Chunn, who went by the stage name &quot;Zen&quot;. The two managed to attract some attention from record labels - enough to get one of their few recorded songs &quot;Just Wanna Be Your Friend&quot; on a soundtrack for the television drama &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. The two were in talks of being signed with Capitol Records, but Jenkins did not see eye to eye on the label&#x27;s views on the musical direction or what music producer they would work with, and negotiations fell through. The group broke up shortly afterwards, and while short-lived, it was in the group that Jenkins first developed connections in the industry, and wrote the first iteration of what would become Third Eye Blind&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Semi-Charmed Life&quot;.

After the &quot;Puck and Zen&quot; experience, Jenkins moved into the direction of starting a rock band instead. Jenkins recounted that over the span of a few years, he would recruit members, only to have them drop out because of drug addiction or join other bands. Jenkins would write and workshop early material with musician Jason Slater for years before the band started up formally, and the two recorded the band&#x27;s first demo together in 1993. Jenkins reconnected with music producer and sound engineer David Gleeson, a contact from his Puck and Natty days, to be able to record demos at professional studios like Skywalker Ranch. Gleeson assisted in the sessions, but eventually had a falling-out with Jenkins and stopped working with the band. George Earth also played guitar on some demos. Much of the contents of the first demo, such as the track &quot;Hold Me Down&quot;, were scrapped and shelved entirely, but Jenkins continued to work on some material like &quot;Semi-Charmed Life&quot; or &quot;Alright Caroline&quot; that were eventually released. Around this time, guitarist Tony Fredianelli auditioned for the band, though according to Slater, Jenkins believed him to be &quot;too [heavy] metal&quot; for the band. Around the time frame of 1993 and 1994, Slater departed the band, while guitarist Kevin Cadogan and bassist Arion Salazar joined. The band cycled through a number of drummers including Adrian Burley, Steve Bowman (Counting Crows), and Michael Urbano (Smash Mouth).

Salazar noted that the band struggled to make much progress prior to the arrival of Cadogan, and felt that the songs really started to develop when Cadogan&#x27;s big guitar sound was added to Jenkin&#x27;s more stripped-down demos. The two became songwriting partners, with Jenkins writing lyrics and Cadogan helping him brainstorm musical ideas; together, they worked on a second set of demos. The band toured locally during 1994 and early 1995, building up a following. However, in July 1995, the band hit a significant setback with a disastrous &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; performance that would see the winner be offered a record deal. Urbano (the drummer at the time) quit shortly before the show, Jenkins was sick and unable to perform well, and Cadogan blew out his guitar amp two songs into the show. They lost the contest, and with it, the potential record deal and the confidence of their management and studio team, who left the band right afterwards. On the verge of breaking up, the band instead regrouped and recruited two new key people: Drummer Brad Hargreaves and manager Eric Gotland, a long-time personal friend and confidant of Jenkins. Jenkins, Cadogan, Salazar, and Hargreaves would go on to be the core lineup for the band during the recording of its first two studio albums.

Through past connections of Slater and Gotland, Third Eye Blind started recording a third demo with producer and sound engineer Eric Valentine, with some additional funding from a partially interested RCA Records, from late 1995 to February 1996. Valentine noted that he had heard the demos the band had recorded prior to his arrival, but felt they were &quot;not ready&quot; and needed to be reworked or discarded. He later expressed more satisfaction with material he had worked on. RCA passed on the band after hearing the material, but the demos instead attracted the attention of Arista Records. Label founder Clive Davis invited the band to perform at a band showcase in New York City in March 1996. During Third Eye Blind concerts at the time, it was customary for the band to have a piñata release candy above their mosh pits, yet at the showcase for the record executives, lead singer Jenkins released live crickets from the piñata instead. Cadogan noted that the performance was ultimately unsuccessful, and Davis passed on signing the band; however, but the event built hype and notoriety for the band, and Salazar noted that the well-developed, 14-song demo they had recorded with Valentine still had helped the band feel more prepared to deal with record labels. In April 1996, after Jenkins had challenged Epic Records executive Dave Massey in a meeting, the band landed an opening gig for Oasis at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium. In an unlikely scenario for an opening act, the band was invited back for an encore after playing their initial set and was paid double by the concert promoter. In addition, Jenkins&#x27; production of hip hop duo The Braids&#x27; cover of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; gained major-label attention. Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, and after another showcase in June 1996 in Los Angeles, the band signed a contract with Sylvia Rhone of Elektra Records because they believed that contract offered the most artistic freedom. The contract was later reported as the largest publishing deal ever for an unsigned artist at the time.

===Debut album &quot;Third Eye Blind&quot;: 1997–1998===
While the band had finally accomplished their goal of getting signed, troubles persisted with the band. Jenkins and Valentine clashed; Valentine was hired as a sound engineer, but felt he was tasked with duties that a full-fledged music producer would do, without the pay that would normally come with the role. Valentine ended up getting a co-production credit, but people involved felt he did far more for the album than technically credited for. Valentine also criticized Jenkins&#x27;s decision to buyout all of Zen&#x27;s early contribution to album material. Jenkins contended that he heavily reworked any of Zen&#x27;s contributions. Cadogan also became disillusioned throughout the recording sessions. His understanding was that his role in the band was of an equal partnership with Jenkins, but did not feel he was treated as such. Valentine reported that while Jenkins and Cadogan recorded good material together, they were constantly at odds with one another in the studio, with their relationship deteriorating over time as they finished the album. Additionally, unbeknownst to the rest of the band until years later, even though both Cadogan and Jenkins were signed to the deal from the record label, days prior to the signing, Jenkins secretly set up a Third Eye Blind Inc&quot; as a corporation, and named himself the sole owner and shareholder, giving him complete control over all legal and financial matters in the band.

Despite the issues, the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Third Eye Blind&quot;, was finished and released in April 1997. As a new artist, the album did not particularly debut high in the US all-format &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album&#x27;s chart, and only ever peaked at number 25 on the chart, but consistently sold each week, staying on the chart for over a year straight. Sales approached 1 million in the US by the end of 1997. The album&#x27;s sales were propelled by the success of their first single, the long-worked-upon and finalized version of &quot;Semi-Charmed Life&quot;. It not only performed well on rock radio, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart for 8 weeks, but also found crossover success, peaking at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Four subsequent singles - &quot;Graduate&quot;, &quot;How&#x27;s It Going to Be&quot;, &quot;Losing a Whole Year&quot;, and &quot;Jumper&quot; - kept the album selling well into 1998. &quot;How&#x27;s It Going to Be&quot; and &quot;Jumper&quot; similarly succeeded &quot;Semi-Charmed Life&quot; as crossover hits as well, peaking at number 9 and 5 respectively on the all-format &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The album would go on to be certified platinum six times by the RIAA, indicating over six million copies sold in the US. Meanwhile, &quot;Billboard&quot; named it the number one modern rock track of the year. The band toured extensively in support of the album, including opening for large acts such as U2 and The Rolling Stones in late 1997, before quickly graduating to headlining status afterwards throughout 1998. The band toured extensively throughout the year, including a 3-month tour with Smash Mouth and a larger venue amphitheater tour mid-year, and a college tour with Eve 6. The touring was seen as a success, as the band continued to book increasingly higher profile shows but the touring was not without issues, including a 1997 show where Jenkins fell unconscious after falling off the side of a stage, Salazar missing some 1997 shows because he was hospitalized by a viral infection, and an incident at a festival in 1998 where Salazar and Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt got into a physical altercation.

===&quot;Blue&quot; and departure of Cadogan: 1999–2000===
The band began work on a second album in January 1999, directly after finishing their 1998 tour with Eve 6. By March, Jenkins reported that there were already 30 songs in contention for the follow-up album, and that recording would start in April. The band were given a tight deadline of six months to submit a completely recorded album by October 1999. While Jenkins would publicly state that sessions were fast and carefree at the time, both Cadogan and Jenkins would retrospectively reflect on the sessions being very difficult. Cadogan and Jenkins were already not getting along while touring in support of their self-titled album, and Cadogan was outraged to finally find out that Jenkins had secretly legally and financially put himself in charge of the band, and of Salazar and Hargreaves&#x27; indifference to it. Cadogan recounted that he later found out that Jenkins and Godtland had started to make plans to replace Cadogan prior to even beginning work on a second album, but the plans were not acted on. Cadogan stated that he and Jenkins agreed to put aside their differences and work together on further music; Cadogan set up a 2-week period where the band would write and record early song ideas in Cadogan&#x27;s house with sound engineer Jason Carmer. Cadogan noted that it was the only time in the six-month period where the band collaborated and worked together in the same room; the rest of the parts were written and recorded independently at separate times in the studio and then later compiled together into the finished album because of the animosity between them. A major point of contention was which songs to keep on the album and which ones to cut; Jenkins and Cadogan had each written songs individually, and each of them fought for more of his own songs to make the final track list. Godtland set up a voting system where each member could vote for a certain number of songs, and that process led to further animosity. Among particular contention was the track &quot;Slow Motion&quot;, a controversial ballad written by Jenkins about a student shooting a teacher&#x27;s son. While Jenkins insisted that the song was satirical parody, and actually anti-violence, Elektra disapproved of the track being on the album, feeling it could cause controversy because of the proximity of the Columbine High School massacre, which had just happened in April of that year. The band and the label fought over the song&#x27;s inclusion for four months, with the label proposing a compromise that would allow only the instrumental to be on the album, and in return, the label would finance an EP to be released after the album, where the band could release the song in its entirety and have complete creative freedom, without restriction. Cadogan, already unhappy with his lack of ownership over the band, was the sole member of the band to object to the deal, knowing he would not have any control over the deal&#x27;s terms of a cash advance and imprint label creation for the EP.

On November 23, 1999, the band released their second album, &quot;Blue.&quot; It sold 75,000 copies in the week it was released, and by 2003 had sold 1.25 million in the U.S. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Anything&quot;, &quot;Never Let You Go&quot;, &quot;10 Days Late&quot;, and &quot;Deep Inside of You&quot;. &quot;Never Let You Go&quot; came close to replicating the success of the singles from the bands first album, peaking at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; all-format US singles chart. &quot;Deep Inside of You&quot; also made it on to the chart, albeit peaking at 69. &quot;Anything&quot; and &quot;10 Days Late&quot; performed moderately at rock radio, hitting 11 and 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock song chart. &quot;Blue&quot; would be certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating over a million sold in the US; a strong achievement, but well below their first album&#x27;s six time platinum achievement.

Two months after the album release, on January 26, 2000, it was announced that Cadogan had been fired after playing a show at the Sundance Film Festival. No reason for the termination was given at the time, just a message from Godtland that Jenkins, Salazar, Hargreaves wished him well. Cadogan was immediately replaced by Tony Fredianelli, who had briefly jammed with the band in 1993 in the band&#x27;s formative years, and had sometimes supported the band as a live keyboardist as well. The new lineup toured heavily in support of the album, including a North American tour through much of 2000, including the &quot;Dragons and Astronauts&quot; tour with Vertical Horizon. In June 2000, Cadogan filed a multi-million dollar federal lawsuit against Jenkins. Cadogan filed suit, alleging wrongful termination, adding that his production, recording, and songwriting royalties had been withheld since being kicked out of the band. The band pushed forward with touring in the meantime, continuing to play large venues, but felt pressure from the burgeoning teen pop and nu metal musical movements of the time, which they fell in between without being part of either. In this time period, Jenkins considered working with Limp Bizkit&#x27;s Fred Durst, doing some early work on collaborating on material for both of their respective bands, though none of this material ever ended up being released by either party.

===&quot;Out of the Vein&quot;: 2001–2004===
After four straight years of recording music and touring in support of it, the next couple years were quieter for the band. Originally, the band had planned on starting work on the EP they had agreed upon making as a vehicle to release the controversial &quot;Slow Motion&quot; song kept off of &quot;Blue&quot; by the label. The EP was originally titled &quot;Black&quot;, as a companion piece to &quot;Blue&quot;. Recording plans were delayed from late 2000, to early 2001. By 2001 though, Jenkins had fallen into a deep depression. He isolated himself for almost a year, and turned his attention to writing material for a third studio album, of which he amassed over 40 songs in this time. The band only played a handful of live performances, largely one-off benefit shows. Progress on the album would be slow. The third album was originally scheduled to be released in early 2002, but was delayed several times before its release in May 2003. According to Jenkins, some of the reasons for the delay stemmed from a self-imposed pressure to live up to Third Eye Blind&#x27;s previous successes, leading him to rewrite lyrics. The band also spent substantial time building their own recording studio in San Francisco called Morningwood Studios. During this time, the band&#x27;s lawsuit with Cadogan was finally settled out of court, with the terms of the settlement undisclosed.

On May 13, 2003, the band released their third studio album, &quot;Out of the Vein&quot;. The album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 12; while the charting placement was higher than &quot;Blue&#x27;s&quot; debut at 40, sales were actually substantially down, selling only 62,000 copies, compared to &quot;Blue&#x27;s&quot; 74,000 copies. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Blinded&quot; and &quot;Crystal Baller&quot;. Neither songs performed to the level of prior singles; neither placed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and only &quot;Blinded&quot; charted at rock radio, peaking at 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock songs chart. &quot;Out of the Vein&quot; long-term sales also fell behind its predecessors, with numbers estimated around 500,000 copies as of March 2007. Elektra Records was being absorbed into Atlantic Records at the time, and because of the merger, the band found themselves without label support; as Jenkins said, &quot;Our record company ceased to exist. The month the record was released, Elektra Records imploded.&quot; In May 2004, Warner Music cut Third Eye Blind, along with over 80 other acts, from its roster. While no specific reason was given for Third Eye Blind being cut, Atlantic co-chairman Craig Kallman said the cuts were made to get Atlantic&#x27;s roster down to an appropriate size where &quot;we can give each of our acts top priority.&quot; Plans to release an EP still persisted for a time. After the &quot;Out of the Vein&quot; sessions, the band dropped the name &quot;Black&quot; and started referring to the EP as &quot;Symphony of Decay&quot;. A month after the release of &quot;Out of the Vein&quot;, in June 2003, Jenkins stated to VH1 that the band planned on releasing the EP as soon as September 2003. However, it was repeatedly delayed, and Hargreaves indicated that its release became difficult after their departure from Elektra, and the idea was eventually dropped altogether. The full lyrics version of &quot;Slow Motion&quot; would instead finally see a vehicle of release through a greatest hits collection, &quot;A Collection&quot; in 2006.

===&quot;Ursa Major&quot;: 2005–2010===
With promotional efforts for &quot;Out of the Vein&quot; fizzling out in 2004, the band would again be quieter for the next few years. Jenkins would help with producing then-girlfriend Vanessa Carlton&#x27;s album &quot;Harmonium&quot;; the experience motivated Jenkins to start writing a solo album of his own. At the same time, Fredianelli, Salazar, and Hargreaves had also been working on music together, and upon hearing it, Jenkins scrapped his solo plan in favor of working on a fourth studio album with the band. Work on the album began in early 2005, but progressed slowly, and Jenkins suffered from writer&#x27;s block and struggled to write lyrics for the songs that had been created for him by the rest of the band. As of mid-2006, the album was untitled and had a rough release date of 2007. Around this time, Salazar became disillusioned with the band, and left. Salazar wasn&#x27;t immediately replaced as a member; in the coming years, Abe Millet and Leo Kramer played bass while touring, while a variety of bass players filled in while recording in the studio. In 2007, Jenkins announced that the fourth studio album had a tentative title of &quot;The Hideous Strength&quot;, had around 35 songs written for it, and that some of the lyrics had become political in nature. The band continued to tour, with the band previewing work-in-progress versions of new songs while Jenkins continued to revise lyrics. Despite it being years since the band released an album, the band still maintained a strong following in live performances, and the band continued to tour while Jenkins struggled with writer&#x27;s block. Fredianelli noted that lyrics were continually being rewritten, and as a result, songs often needed to be re-recorded to accommodate the changes, which continued to delay an album release.

As the process would drag on, privately, internal strife would flare up again across 2008. According to Fredianelli, morale was low at the time because of the departure of Salazar, Jenkins beginning to lose interest in the band, and tensions between Jenkins and long-time friend and band manager Eric Godtland. Jenkins fired Godtland and sued him, accusing him of not paying Jenkins enough, and Godtland in turn counter-sued him, responding that the lower pay was due to lessened productivity by the band, a fault of Jenkins himself, not Godtland, and this had caused an unfair decrease in pay for Godtland himself. Fredianelli then claimed that Jenkins insisted that the rest of the band also join in and file lawsuits against Godtland too, threatening to abandon the band if they didn&#x27;t. Fredianelli, not wanting to abandon the band after all the work done on the long-awaited album, went along with Jenkin&#x27;s plan, creating a deposition against Godtland, creating friction between the two. As months passed, Fredianelli felt guilt about it, and apologized to Godtland, offering to change his deposition, then angering Jenkins in return. Jenkins lawsuit was eventually dismissed, and Godtland settled his case out of court. The band&#x27;s touring manager would unceremoniously quit shortly after.

Despite the discourse, the band persevered and by late 2008 the material they had been working on for the last five years would finally begin getting released. First, the band would release a teaser of sorts through the three song &quot;Red Star&quot; EP. Secondly, two albums&#x27; worth of material had been written, but with struggles to finalize the recordings, the band opted against a formal double album release, in favor of potentially releasing two connected albums within a year&#x27;s time. The plan would include releasing an &quot;Ursa Major&quot; album with the material that was closest to completion, and a second &quot;Ursa Minor&quot; album later on. Plans continued to change, though; &quot;Ursa Major&quot; was originally slated to a 15 track album released on June 23, 2009. When it was released, it ended up being an 11-song and 1 instrumental album released on August 18, 2009. The album, their first in six years, was released under their own independent label, Mega Collider Records. &quot;Ursa Major&quot; debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 49,000 copies. This made it the band&#x27;s highest-charting album, albeit with sales figures that were the lowest since their debut album. Third Eye Blind also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Albums chart, Top Alternative Albums chart, and Top Digital Albums chart. Three singles were released - &quot;Non-Dairy Creamer&quot; from &quot;Red Star&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe A Word&quot; and &quot;Bonfire&quot; from &quot;Ursa Major&quot;, but all failed to place on any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

The band toured in support of &quot;Ursa Major&quot; throughout 2009, but in early 2010, Fredianelli was fired from the band. Irish musician Kryz Reid replaced Fredianelli on guitar, while Third Eye Blind continued to tour in support the album in 2010, most notably co-headlining The Bamboozle Roadshow between May and June 2010. Both Jenkins and Hargreaves would continue to mention an &quot;Ursa Minor&quot; release, but the focus remained on touring, and the release would eventually be cancelled by Jenkins because of the involvement and subsequent departure of Fredianelli. Fredianelli would go on to sue Jenkins for over 8 million dollars based on many claims of breach of contract and missing writing credits and money and royalties owed from it. Many of the claims were rejected because of Fredinelli&#x27;s accusations contradicting the actual contract he signed from Jenkins and Godtland. Still, the claims of lost wages from touring were supported, awarding $448,000 to Fredianelli.

===&quot;Dopamine&quot;: 2011–2015===

The band would again turn to extensive touring in the following years. In addition to Jenkins, Hargreaves, and newly recruited guitarist Reid, the band stopped relying on temporary studio and touring support for bass playing, and hiring a new permanent bassist, Alex LeCavalier. Additionally, for the first time, a fifth official member, Alex Kopp, was brought on as a dedicated keyboardist. Work on a fifth album continued, with earliest reports showing plans for a 2011 release, but writer&#x27;s block continued to hamper Jenkins ability to complete lyrics for songs. The only newly recorded studio music the band would release for years was the impromptu-written &quot;If There Ever Was a Time&quot; song released in support of the Occupy Wall Street movement in November 2011. Moving into 2012, with writer&#x27;s block continuing to hinder the process, Jenkins would begin to advertise the album as the band&#x27;s last, feeling that the volume and structure of the album format was what made the writing process difficult for him. By the end of the year, the band did a short tour in India to help inspire the writing process; the band was far enough along to announce they were shooting a music video for a track. However, the album&#x27;s release continued to be delayed from 2013 to 2014 to 2015. Writer&#x27;s block continued to be cited as the reason by Jenkins, though Hargreaves also noted that their past successes had afforded them the luxury of taking their time on material without having to rush it because of financial matters.

In May 2015, the band announced that their fifth studio album was finally completed, and on June 16, almost six years after their last album, the album, titled, &quot;Dopamine&quot; was released. The album debuted at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling just over 21,000 copies in its first week. Two singles were released - &quot;Everything Is Easy&quot; and &quot;Get Me Out of Here&quot; A non-album cover of Beyoncé song &quot;Mine&quot; was also released to promote the album after live performances of the song received a warm reception in the touring leading up to the album&#x27;s release.

===&quot;We Are Drugs&quot; and &quot;Screamer&quot;: 2016–2019===

Following the release of &quot;Dopamine&quot;, the lineup of Jenkins, Hargreaves, Reid, LeCavelier, and Kopp experienced an increase in productivity not seen since the late 1990s. Jenkins announced plans for releasing an EP in 2016. On July 19, 2016, they played a benefit concert for &quot;Musicians on Call&quot;, a charity organization, in close proximity to the Republican National Convention. The band took the opportunity to speak out against the Republican Party, criticizing their views on science and LGBT rights, and playing tracks specifically critical of their stances, including &quot;Jumper&quot;, and &quot;Non-Dairy Creamer&quot;. The stunt received national coverage, and inspired the band to move forward with material. The EP, the seven track &quot;We Are Drugs&quot;, was released on October 7, 2016, just 16 months after the release of &quot;Dopamine&quot;. One single, the politically themed &quot;Cop Vs. Phone Girl&quot;, 
was released from the EP.

Jenkins announced next plans to be releasing another EP titled &quot;Summer Gods&quot; in 2017 to coincide with a tour of the same name. With the EP not ready for release by the end of the tour, the idea was scrapped and the name was instead assigned to a live album release of performances from the tour. Some new music was still released in the year though, in the form of the 20th anniversary release of their debut album. Newly recorded versions of old songs from the sessions were released, including a finalized version of the 1993 song &quot;Alright Caroline&quot;. In June 2018, another EP was released - a collection of seven cover songs titled &quot;Thanks for Everything&quot;. Jenkins stated that the act of reinterpreting the cover songs of various genres inspired the band to create another full studio album in the process. Initially announced as another EP in late 2018, the project bloomed into the band&#x27;s sixth studio album in 2019. The band continued to tour into 2019, including a major co-headlining North American tour with Jimmy Eat World from June to August, called &quot;Summer Gods Tour 2019&quot;. Prior to the tour, Kopp announced he was leaving the band to pursue other projects, He was replaced by Colin Creev. On October 18, 2019, the band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Screamer&quot;.

===&quot;Our Bande Apart&quot; and upcoming eighth studio album: 2020–present===
After releasing their sixth studio album &quot;Screamer&quot;, in October 2019, the band was able to complete the first leg of the tour supporting it, but was forced to cancel the second leg of it in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic—the first time the band had to cancel a tour in 22 years according to Jenkins. The band instead performed live online streaming performances, and largely turned to writing more new music instead. Jenkins began writing in solitude during the initial wave of lockdowns, and began recording with the rest of the band as soon as the lockdowns ended.

On July 30, 2021, the band announced their seventh studio album, &quot;Our Bande Apart&quot;, would be released on September 24, 2021, and released the first single from it, &quot;Box of Bones&quot;. A second song, &quot;Again&quot;, was released ahead of the album on August 20, featuring Best Coast singer Bethany Cosentino. The band was able to tour again, in support of the album, in 2022, with a North American tour with Taking Back Sunday and Hockey Dad. They also released an acoustic album, &quot;Unplugged&quot; in June 2022. Jenkins described it as &quot;just basically any song that [he] wanted another try at.&quot; The band put on another North American tour across March and April 2023 as well.

In early 2024, a new iteration of the &quot;Summer Gods&quot; tour was announced, with the band touring with Yellowcard from June to August 2024. Jenkin&#x27;s also noted in March that the band was working on a new studio album, and that they wished to release new music prior to the tour, though he wasn&#x27;t sure the whole album would be ready for release by then. New music did not release prior to the tour; Hargreaves noted that 4 to 6 songs were largely recorded since 2022, but still required Jenkins to finish writing and recording lyrics and vocals.

==Musical style and influences==
Third Eye Blind&#x27;s musical style has been described as pop rock, alternative rock, post-grunge, pop punk, and power pop.

<doc id="489394" wikidata="Q1347011" url="?curid=489394" title="Schläfli symbol">
<text>In geometry, the Schläfli symbol is a notation of the form formula_1 that defines regular polytopes and tessellations.

The Schläfli symbol is named after the 19th-century Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli, who generalized Euclidean geometry to more than three dimensions and discovered all their convex regular polytopes, including the six that occur in four dimensions.
== Definition ==
The Schläfli symbol is a recursive description, starting with formula_2 for a formula_3 for-sided regular polygon that is convex. For example, {3} is an equilateral triangle, {4} is a square, {5} a convex regular pentagon, etc.

Regular star polygons are not convex, and their Schläfli symbols formula_4 for contain irreducible fractions formula_5, where formula_3 is the number of vertices, and formula_7 is their turning number. Equivalently, formula_4 is created from the vertices of {&quot;p&quot;}, connected every &quot;q&quot;. For example, formula_9 is a pentagram; formula_10 is a pentagon.

A regular polyhedron that has formula_7 regular formula_3-sided polygon faces around each vertex is represented by formula_13. For example, the cube has 3 squares around each vertex and is represented by {4,3}.

A regular 4-dimensional polytope, with formula_14 regular polyhedral cells around each edge is represented by formula_15. For example, a tesseract, {4,3,3}, has 3 cubes, {4,3}, around an edge.

In general, a regular polytope formula_16 has formula_17 facets around every peak, where a peak is a vertex in a polyhedron, an edge in a 4-polytope, a face in a 5-polytope, and an (&quot;n&quot;-3)-face in an &quot;n&quot;-polytope.

==Properties==
A regular polytope has a regular vertex figure. The vertex figure of a regular polytope {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;...,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;} is {&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;...,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;}.

Regular polytopes can have star polygon elements, like the pentagram, with symbol , represented by the vertices of a pentagon but connected alternately.

The Schläfli symbol can represent a finite convex polyhedron, an infinite tessellation of Euclidean space, or an infinite tessellation of hyperbolic space, depending on the angle defect of the construction. A positive angle defect allows the vertex figure to &quot;fold&quot; into a higher dimension and loops back into itself as a polytope. A zero angle defect tessellates space of the same dimension as the facets. A negative angle defect cannot exist in ordinary space, but can be constructed in hyperbolic space.

Usually, a facet or a vertex figure is assumed to be a finite polytope, but can sometimes itself be considered a tessellation.

A regular polytope also has a dual polytope, represented by the &quot;Schläfli symbol&quot; elements in reverse order. A self-dual regular polytope will have a symmetric Schläfli symbol.

In addition to describing Euclidean polytopes, Schläfli symbols can be used to describe spherical polytopes or spherical honeycombs.

== History and variations ==
Schläfli&#x27;s work was almost unknown in his lifetime, and his notation for describing polytopes was rediscovered independently by several others. In particular, Thorold Gosset rediscovered the Schläfli symbol which he wrote as |&quot;p&quot;|&quot;q&quot;|&quot;r&quot;|...|&quot;z&quot;| rather than with brackets and commas as Schläfli did.

Gosset&#x27;s form has greater symmetry, so the number of dimensions is the number of vertical bars, and the symbol exactly includes the sub-symbols for facet and vertex figure. Gosset regarded |&quot;p&quot; as an operator, which can be applied to |&quot;q&quot;|...|&quot;z&quot;| to produce a polytope with &quot;p&quot;-gonal faces whose vertex figure is |&quot;q&quot;|...|&quot;z&quot;|.

== Cases ==

=== Symmetry groups ===

Schläfli symbols are closely related to (finite) reflection symmetry groups, which correspond precisely to the finite Coxeter groups and are specified with the same indices, but square brackets instead [&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;...]. Such groups are often named by the regular polytopes they generate. For example, [3,3] is the Coxeter group for reflective tetrahedral symmetry, [3,4] is reflective octahedral symmetry, and [3,5] is reflective icosahedral symmetry.

=== Regular polygons (plane) ===
The Schläfli symbol of a convex regular polygon with &quot;p&quot; edges is {&quot;p&quot;}. For example, a regular pentagon is represented by {5}.

For nonconvex star polygons, the constructive notation is used, where &quot;p&quot; is the number of vertices and is the number of vertices skipped when drawing each edge of the star. For example, represents the pentagram.

=== Regular polyhedra (3 dimensions) ===
The Schläfli symbol of a regular polyhedron is {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;} if its faces are &quot;p&quot;-gons, and each vertex is surrounded by &quot;q&quot; faces (the vertex figure is a &quot;q&quot;-gon).

For example, {5,3} is the regular dodecahedron. It has pentagonal (5 edges) faces, and 3 pentagons around each vertex.

See the 5 convex Platonic solids, the 4 nonconvex Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.

Topologically, a regular 2-dimensional tessellation may be regarded as similar to a (3-dimensional) polyhedron, but such that the angular defect is zero. Thus, Schläfli symbols may also be defined for regular tessellations of Euclidean or hyperbolic space in a similar way as for polyhedra. The analogy holds for higher dimensions.

For example, the hexagonal tiling is represented by {6,3}.

=== Regular 4-polytopes (4 dimensions) ===

The Schläfli symbol of a regular 4-polytope is of the form {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;}. Its (two-dimensional) faces are regular &quot;p&quot;-gons ({&quot;p&quot;}), the cells are regular polyhedra of type {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}, the vertex figures are regular polyhedra of type {&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;}, and the edge figures are regular &quot;r&quot;-gons (type {&quot;r&quot;}).

See the six convex regular and 10 regular star 4-polytopes.

For example, the 120-cell is represented by {5,3,3}. It is made of dodecahedron cells {5,3}, and has 3 cells around each edge.

There is one regular tessellation of Euclidean 3-space: the cubic honeycomb, with a Schläfli symbol of {4,3,4}, made of cubic cells and 4 cubes around each edge.

There are also 4 regular compact hyperbolic tessellations including {5,3,4}, the hyperbolic small dodecahedral honeycomb, which fills space with dodecahedron cells.

If a 4-polytope&#x27;s symbol is palindromic (e.g. {3,3,3} or {3,4,3}), its bitruncation will only have truncated forms of the vertex figure as cells.

=== Regular &quot;n&quot;-polytopes (higher dimensions) ===

For higher-dimensional regular polytopes, the Schläfli symbol is defined recursively as if the facets have Schläfli symbol and the vertex figures have Schläfli symbol .

A vertex figure of a facet of a polytope and a facet of a vertex figure of the same polytope are the same: .

There are only 3 regular polytopes in 5 dimensions and above: the simplex, {3, 3, 3, ..., 3}; the cross-polytope, {3, 3, ..., 3, 4}; and the hypercube, {4, 3, 3, ..., 3}. There are no non-convex regular polytopes above 4 dimensions.
=== Dual polytopes ===
If a polytope of dimension n≥2 has Schläfli symbol {&quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1} then its dual has Schläfli symbol {&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, ..., &quot;p&quot;2, &quot;p&quot;1}.

If the sequence is palindromic, i.e. the same forwards and backwards, the polytope is &quot;self-dual&quot;. Every regular polytope in 2 dimensions (polygon) is self-dual.

=== Prismatic polytopes ===

Uniform prismatic polytopes can be defined and named as a Cartesian product (with operator &quot;×&quot;) of lower-dimensional regular polytopes.
* In 0D, a point is represented by ( ). Its Coxeter diagram is empty. Its Coxeter notation symmetry is ][.
* In 1D, a line segment is represented by { }. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [ ].
* In 2D, a rectangle is represented as { } × { }. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [2].
* In 3D, a &quot;p&quot;-gonal prism is represented as { } × {&quot;p&quot;}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [2,&quot;p&quot;].
* In 4D, a uniform {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}-hedral prism is represented as { } × {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [2,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;].
* In 4D, a uniform &quot;p&quot;-&quot;q&quot; duoprism is represented as {&quot;p&quot;} × {&quot;q&quot;}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [&quot;p&quot;,2,&quot;q&quot;].

The prismatic duals, or bipyramids can be represented as composite symbols, but with the &quot;addition&quot; operator, &quot;+&quot;.
* In 2D, a rhombus is represented as { } + { }. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [2].
* In 3D, a &quot;p&quot;-gonal bipyramid, is represented as { } + {&quot;p&quot;}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [2,&quot;p&quot;].
* In 4D, a {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}-hedral bipyramid is represented as { } + {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;].
* In 4D, a &quot;p&quot;-&quot;q&quot; duopyramid is represented as {&quot;p&quot;} + {&quot;q&quot;}. Its Coxeter diagram is . Its symmetry is [&quot;p&quot;,2,&quot;q&quot;].

Pyramidal polytopes containing vertices orthogonally offset can be represented using a join operator, &quot;∨&quot;. Every pair of vertices between joined figures are connected by edges.

In 2D, an isosceles triangle can be represented as ( ) ∨ { } = ( ) ∨ [( ) ∨ ( )].

In 3D:
* A digonal disphenoid can be represented as { } ∨ { } = [( ) ∨ ( )] ∨ [( ) ∨ ( )].
* A &quot;p-gonal pyramid&quot; is represented as ( ) ∨ {&quot;p&quot;}.
In 4D:
* A &quot;p-q-hedral pyramid&quot; is represented as ( ) ∨ {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}.
*A 5-cell is represented as ( ) ∨ [( ) ∨ {3}] or [( ) ∨ ( )] ∨ {3} = { } ∨ {3}.
*A square pyramidal pyramid is represented as ( ) ∨ [( ) ∨ {4}] or [( ) ∨ ( )] ∨ {4} = { } ∨ {4}.
When mixing operators, the order of operations from highest to lowest is ×, +, ∨.

Axial polytopes containing vertices on parallel offset hyperplanes can be represented by the ‖ operator. A uniform prism is {&quot;n&quot;}‖{&quot;n&quot;} and antiprism {&quot;n&quot;}‖&quot;r&quot;{&quot;n&quot;}.

== Extension of Schläfli symbols ==

=== Polygons and circle tilings ===

A truncated regular polygon doubles in sides. A regular polygon with even sides can be halved. An altered even-sided regular 2n-gon generates a star figure compound, 2{n}.
=== Polyhedra and tilings ===
Coxeter expanded his usage of the Schläfli symbol to quasiregular polyhedra by adding a vertical dimension to the symbol. It was a starting point toward the more general Coxeter diagram. Norman Johnson simplified the notation for vertical symbols with an &quot;r&quot; prefix. The t-notation is the most general, and directly corresponds to the rings of the Coxeter diagram. Symbols have a corresponding alternation, replacing &quot;rings&quot; with &quot;holes&quot; in a Coxeter diagram and &quot;h&quot; prefix standing for &quot;half&quot;, construction limited by the requirement that neighboring branches must be even-ordered and cuts the symmetry order in half. A related operator, &quot;a&quot; for &quot;altered&quot;, is shown with two nested holes, represents a compound polyhedra with both alternated halves, retaining the original full symmetry. A snub is a half form of a truncation, and a holosnub is both halves of an alternated truncation.

==== Alternations, quarters and snubs ====
Alternations have half the symmetry of the Coxeter groups and are represented by unfilled rings. There are two choices possible on which half of vertices are taken, but the symbol does not imply which one. Quarter forms are shown here with a + inside a hollow ring to imply they are two independent alternations.

==== Altered and holosnubbed ====
Altered and holosnubbed forms have the full symmetry of the Coxeter group, and are represented by double unfilled rings, but may be represented as compounds.
: ß, looking similar to the greek letter beta (β), is the German alphabet letter eszett.

=== Polychora and honeycombs ===

<doc id="489399" wikidata="Q1037748" url="?curid=489399" title="Dōgo Onsen">
<text>is a hot spring in the city of Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku, Japan.

==History==

Dōgo Onsen is one of the oldest hot springs in Japan, with a history stretching back over 1000 years. The springs are mentioned in the Man&#x27;yōshū (written c. 759) and, according to legend, Prince Shōtoku (574–622) used to partake of the waters.

Dōgo Onsen was the favorite retreat of writer Natsume Sōseki (1867–1916) when he was working near Matsuyama as a teacher in what was at the time rural Shikoku. In Soseki&#x27;s loosely autobiographical novel &quot;Botchan&quot;, the eponymous main character is a frequent visitor to the springs, the only place he likes in the area.

==Description==
Dōgo Onsen is famous for the Dōgo Onsen public bathhouse, which was organized by Dōgo Yunomachi mayor Isaniwa Yukiya and built in 1894. Built on three levels for maximum capacity, the baths remain popular and are usually crowded at peak times, such as in the early evening before dinner.

While Dōgo is largely engulfed in the suburban sprawl of modern-day Matsuyama, the area around Dōgo retains the feeling of a resort town, with guests from all over the country wandering the streets in &quot;yukata&quot; robes after their bath. Dōgo is easily accessible from central Matsuyama by tram and has regular bus services to and from the air and ferry ports.

==Yushinden==
Yushinden (又新殿) is a bath room specially reserved for the Imperial Family. Yushinden is on the east side of the main building. The name is taken from a Chinese classic. Yushinden was built in 1899 in the traditional architecture of Momoyama period.

The Gyokuza no Ma is a bath room for the exclusive use of the Emperor.

==Legends==
In Dōgo, two legends were handed down.

===Legend of the egret===
Long ago, many egrets (herons) lived in Dōgo. One day, an egret who injured his shin found a hot spring there. He soaked his shin every day in the hot water. Eventually the egret became well and flew away. People who watched this situation soaked in the hot spring and their health improved. The news spread that the hot spring was beneficial for one&#x27;s health, and the spring became popular.

===Legend of Tama no ishi===
A long time ago, there were two small gods, Ōkuninushi no Mikoto and Sukunabikona no Mikoto.

They came from Izumo to Dōgo. Sukunabikona no Mikoto contracted a bad illness and his days were numbered. Okuninushi no Mikoto made Sukunahikona no Mikoto soak in the hot spring. Sukunahikona no Mikoto regained his health and danced on a stone in the hot spring as proof of his vigor. At that time, his footprint was left, and there is now a stone called Tama no ishi that is exhibited at Dōgo Onsen.

==In popular culture==
The present building of the Dōgo Onsen public bathhouse partially inspired the design of Yubaba&#x27;s bathhouse in &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.

In Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VII, the Dōgo Onsen is featured as a World Wonder that can be constructed by the player in the Modern Age.

== Features ==
The first floor (Kami-no-Yu) is separated into two baths for men and one for women.

The second floor (Tama-no-Yu) consists of two baths: one for men and one for women. There are four bathing plans with different rates.

<doc id="489401" wikidata="Q1473" url="?curid=489401" title="Davao City">
<text>Davao City, officially the City of Davao (; ; ), is a highly urbanized city in the Davao Region, Philippines. The city has a total land area of , making it the largest city in the Philippines in terms of land area. It is the third-most populous city in the Philippines after Quezon City and Manila respectively, and the most populous city in Mindanao, in Davao Region, and outside of Metro Manila. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 1,776,949 people.

It is the largest city in the province of Davao del Sur both in population and land area wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the Philippine Statistics Authority, but the city is governed and administered independently from it. The city is divided into three congressional districts, which are subdivided into 11 administrative districts with a total of 182 barangays.

Davao City is the regional center of Davao Region and also the center of Metro Davao, the second most populous metropolitan area in the Philippines. The city serves as the main trade, commerce, and industry hub of Mindanao, and the regional center of Davao Region. The region of Davao is home to Mount Apo, the highest mountain in the Philippines, which is highly visible in most parts of Davao City. The city is also nicknamed the &quot;Durian Capital of the Philippines&quot;.

==Etymology==
The region&#x27;s name is derived from its Bagobo origins, who are indigenous to the area. The word &quot;davao&quot; came from the phonetic blending of three Bagobo subgroups&#x27; names for the Davao River, a major waterway emptying into Davao Gulf near the city. The Obos, who inhabit the hinterlands of the region, called the river &quot;Davah&quot; (with a gentle vowel ending, although later pronunciation is with a hard &quot;v&quot; or &quot;b&quot;); the Clatta (or Giangan/Diangan) called it &quot;Dawaw&quot;, and the Tagabawas called it &quot;Dabo&quot;. To the Obos, &quot;davah&quot; also means &quot;a place beyond the high grounds&quot; (alluding to settlements at the mouth of the river surrounded by high, rolling hills).

==History==
===Precolonial era===
The area of what is now Davao City was once a lush forest inhabited by Lumadic peoples such as the Bagobos and Matigsalugs, alongside other ethnic groups such as the Aeta, Maguindanaon and the Kagan. Davao River was then called Tagloc River by the Bagobos, Maguindanaons and Tausugs who then inhabited a settlement near the mouth of the river to the sea around what is now Bolton Riverside due immediately southwest of the city plaza. In 1543, Spanish explorers led by Ruy Lopez de Villalobos sailing around Mindanao deliberately avoided the area around Davao Gulf, then called Gulf of Tagloc, due to the danger posed by fleets of Moro warships operating in the area while surveying the southeastern coast of Mindanao for possible colonization, and as a result the Davao Gulf area remained virtually untouched by European explorers for the next three centuries.

===Maguindanao era===
A Maguindanaon Datu under the name Datu Bago was rewarded the territory of the surroundings of Davao Gulf by the Sultan of Maguindanao Sultanate for joining the campaign against the Spanish in the late 1700s. From his ancestral home in Maguindanao, he moved to the area in 1800 and, having convinced Bagobos and other native groups in the area to his side, conquered the entire Davao Gulf area. Having consolidated his position, he founded the fortress of &quot;Pinagurasan&quot; in what is now the site of Bangkerohan Public Market in 1830 which served as his capital. From being a fortification and base of operations from which Datu Bago could gather and rally his forces, the settlement of Pinagurasan eventually grew into a small city extending from present-day Generoso Bridge in Bangkerohan to Quezon Boulevard more than a kilometer down south, as Maguindanaons and Bagobos alike among other nearby tribes in the area flocked into the settlement, eventually becoming the main trade entrepot in the Davao Gulf area. With his immense overlordship of Davao Gulf, Datu Bago was eventually crowned Sultan by his subjects at his capital Pinagurasan in 1843, effectively making his realm virtually independent from the Sultanate of Maguindanao, becoming a Sultanate with sovereignty over Davao Gulf in equal standing with the Muslim kingdoms of Maguindanao and Sulu.

===Spanish era===
Although the Spaniards began to explore the Davao Gulf area as early as the 16th century, Spanish influence was negligible in the Davao region until 1842, when the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines Narciso Clavería ordered the colonization of the Davao Gulf region, including what is now Davao City, for the Spanish Crown. This came after the loss of their colonies in the Americas from the 1820s to 1830s which gravely reduced their sources of revenue to the point that the royal government in Madrid could no longer continue to properly provide financial support to what remained of its worldwide colonies. Thus, it became more urgent for local officials in the colonies, including the Philippines, to find ways and means of expanding the revenues in running the colonies, primarily in terms of tribute extracted from the natives. It meant that for the first time, the Spanish colonial government in the Philippines was compelled to embark on a full-scale conquest of Mindanao in the hopes of increasing its coffers.

Davao Gulf seemed to be a tempting target among Spanish military circles based in Manila for its thriving maritime trade taking place there. Their initial forays began with their incursion on the village of Sigaboy in 1842, from which the local Spanish officials who recently landed there immediately demanded heavy tribute on the natives who then asked for Datu Bago&#x27;s help in expelling the Spaniards, which he responded swiftly by sending a combined naval and land force in the area to defeat and drive out the Spanish force there. The Spanish, seeing Datu Bago as a mere pirate and brigand, didn&#x27;t take the threat seriously for years despite his numerous victories against them until the burning of the Spanish trading vessel &quot;San Rufo&quot;, which carried a letter of friendship from Sultan Iskandar Qudaratullah Muhammad Zamal al-Azam of Maguindanao to Governor-General Claveria, and its massacre of all its crew by seaborne corsairs under orders from Datu Bago himself in 1846. Incensed with the incident, the Spanish secured the consent from the Sultan of Maguindanao who finally disowned the Moros of Davao Gulf by using the incident as pretext for justification to conquer the area. Thus, the official Spanish colonization of Davao Gulf finally began in earnest in April 1848 when an expedition of 70 men and women led by José Cruz de Oyanguren of Vergara, Spain, landed on the estuary of the Davao River the same month, intent on conquering Pinagurasan, the capital of Datu Bago&#x27;s domain, in the hopes of permanently ending the menace posed on Spanish vessels by Moro raiders in Davao Gulf.

Being the strongest chieftain in the region, Datu Bago imposed heavy tribute on the Mandaya tribes nearby, therefore also making him the most loathed chieftain in the region. Cruz de Uyanguren had orders from the higher authorities in Manila to colonize the Davao Gulf region, which included the Bagobo settlement on the northern riverbank; in return, he asked for the position of the governor of the conquered area and the monopoly of its commerce for ten years. At this juncture, a Mandaya chieftain named Datu Daupan, who then ruled Samal Island, came to him, seeking for an alliance against Datu Bago. The two chieftains were archrivals, and Cruz de Uyanguren took advantage of it, initiating an alliance between Spain and the Mandayas of Samal Island. Intent on taking the settlement for Spain, he and his men accordingly assaulted it, but the Bagobo natives fiercely resisted the attacks, which resulted in his Samal Mandaya allies to desert. Thus, a three-month long inconclusive battle for the possession of the settlement ensued which was only decided when an infantry company which sailed its way by warships from Zamboanga came in as reinforcements, thus ensuring the takeover of the settlement and its surroundings by the Spaniards while the defeated Bagobos fled further inland while Datu Bago and his followers fled north to Hijo where he would die two years later.

After Cruz de Oyanguren defeated Bago and conquered Pinagurasan, he founded the town of &quot;Nueva Vergara&quot;, the future Davao, in the mangrove swamps of what is now Bolton Riverside on June 29, 1848, in honor of his home in Spain and became its first governor. Pinagurasan was then incorporated into the new town. Almost two years later on February 29, 1850, the province of &quot;Nueva Guipúzcoa&quot; was established via a royal decree, with the newly founded town as the capital, once again to honor his homeland in Spain. When he was the governor of the province, however, his plans of fostering a positive economic sway on the region backfired, which resulted in his eventual replacement under orders of the colonial government.

The province of Nueva Guipuzcoa was dissolved on July 30, 1860, as it became the Politico-Military Commandery of Davao. By the clamor of its natives, a petition was given to the Spanish government to rename Nueva Vergara into Davao, the latter being the name used by the natives since its founding. It was eventually accepted in 1867, and Nueva Vergara was given its present name Davao.

The Spanish control of the town was unstable at best, as its Lumad and Moro natives routinely resisted the attempts of the Spanish authorities to forcibly resettle them and convert them into Christianity. Despite all these, such were all done with the goal of making the governance of the area easier, dividing the Christians—both settlers and native converts—and the Muslim Moros into several religion-based communities within the town.

=== During the Philippine Revolution ===
As the Philippine Revolution, having been fought for two years, neared its end in 1898, the expected departure of the Spanish authorities in Davao became apparent, although they took no part in the war at all, owing to the lack of revolutionary figures in the area save for a negligible pro-Filipino separatist rebel movement in the town of Santa Cruz in the south. When the war finally ended, as the Spanish authorities finally left the town, two Davaoeño locals by the names of Pedro Layog and Jose M. Lerma represented the town and the region at the Malolos Congress of 1898, therefore indicating Davao as a part of the nascent First Philippine Republic.

The period of Filipino revolutionary control of Davao did not last long, however, as the Americans landed at the town later the same year. There was no record of locals offering any sort of resistance to the Americans.

===American period===
As the Americans began their administration of the town in 1900, economic opportunities quickly arose as huge swathes of its areas, mainly lush forests and fertile grasslands, were declared open for agricultural investment. As a result, foreign businessmen, especially Japanese entrepreneurs, started settling the region, staking their claims on the vast lands of Davao and turning them into huge coconut and banana plantations. In just a short period, Davao changed from a small and sparsely-inhabited town into a bustling economic center serving the Davao Gulf region, heavily populated alongside natives by tens of thousands of settlers and economic migrants from Luzon, Visayas and Japan. The Port of Davao was established and opened the same year to facilitate the international export of agricultural products from Davao.
Davao was incorporated as a part of Moro Province from 1903 to 1914. When the province was dissolved in 1914, it led to the establishment of Davao Province, with Davao as its provincial capital. What is now the city&#x27;s Legislative Council Building served as the provincial capitol. It was built in 1926, the same year the Davao Municipal Hall, now the City Hall, was constructed.

Because of the rapidly increasing progress of the town, on March 16, 1936, congressman Romualdo Quimpo from Davao filed &quot;Bill 609&quot; (passed as &quot;Commonwealth Act 51&quot;), creating the City of Davao from the town of Davao and the municipal district of Guianga. The bill called for the appointment of local officials by the president. By that time, the new city was already mostly populated with Japanese businessmen and settlers who then became its locals. Davao was inaugurated as a charter city on October 16, 1936, by President Manuel L. Quezon; the charter came into effect on March 1, 1937. It was one of the first two towns in Mindanao to be converted into a city, the other being Zamboanga.

====Second World War====
On December 8, 1941, Japanese planes bombed the harbor, and from December 20 they landed forces and began an occupation of the city which lasted until 1945. Davao was among the earliest to be occupied by Japanese forces, and the city was immediately fortified as a bastion of Japanese defense. Under the brutal Japanese regime, girls, teenagers, and young adults were kidnapped by Japanese soldiers and were forced into becoming sex slaves under the oppressive &quot;comfort women&quot; system, where the victims were routinely gang-raped and killed. Korean and Taiwanese nationals were also brought by the Japanese to Davao and were forced into becoming sex slaves.

The city was subjected to extensive bombing by forces led by Douglas MacArthur before American forces landed in Leyte in October 1944. The Battle of Davao towards the end of World War II was one of the longest and bloodiest battles during the Philippine Liberation, and brought tremendous destruction to the city, setting back the economic and physical strides made before the Japanese occupation.

===Postwar growth===

Davao regained its status as the agricultural and economic hub of Mindanao after the war ended in 1945. Wood products such as plywood and timber, and more agricultural products being produced within the city, such as copra and other varieties of banana, became available for export. Some Japanese locals—80% percent of the city&#x27;s population prior to the war&#x27;s end—assimilated with the Filipino population, while others were expelled from the country by the Filipino locals, due to recent enmity.

Davao was peaceful and increasingly progressive in the postwar period, including the 1950s and the mid-1960s. Ethnic tensions were minimal, and there was essentially no presence of secessionists groups in Mindanao.

In 1967, the Province of Davao was divided into three provinces: Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental and Davao del Sur. The city of Davao became part of Davao del Sur; no longer the provincial capital, it became a commercial center of southern Mindanao. This period also saw the first ever election of an indigenous person to the office of Mayor of Davao City, when Elias Lopez, a full-blooded Bagobo, won the mayoral elections of 1967.

=== Social unrest, martial law, and the 1980s ===

By the late 1960s, Davao had become the regional capital of southern Mindanao; with the reorganization, it became the regional capital of the Davao Region (Region XI) and a highly urbanized city in the province of Davao del Sur.

Things began to take a turn for the worse late into Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; first presidential term, when news about the Jabidah massacre ignited a furor in the Moro community, and ethnic tensions encouraged with the formation of secessionist movements. An economic crisis in late 1969 led to social unrest, and violent crackdowns on protests led to the radicalization of many students throughout the country. With no way to express their grievances about government abuses after the declaration of Martial law in 1972, many of them joined the New People&#x27;s Army (NPA), bringing the Communist rebellion in the Philippines to Davao and the rest of Mindanao for the first time. The movement would continue to grow over the next decade, but was continuing to struggle by the early 1980s, convincing prominent party thinker and idealogue Edgar Jopson to be based there, until he was killed after a raid in Skyline Subdivision in September 1982.

The years immediately after Jopson&#x27;s death saw an unmanageable increase in the Communist Party&#x27;s ranks, however. The 1983 Philippine economic nosedive and the Assassination of Ninoy Aquino a few months later saw the New People&#x27;s Army grow to seven fronts (Battalion sized units), which coincided with a decision to experiment with strategies like urban insurrectionism. Severe violence began with assassinations of corrupt officials and policemen, but Mid-1984 and August 1985 saw 16 journalists killed where only six had been killed in the decade between 1975 and 1984. Agdao, the poor Barangay from which of the NPA got much of its support, began to be known as &quot;Nicaragdao.&quot; Foreign press began labelling Davao the Philippines&#x27; &quot;Murder Capital&quot; and &quot;Killing Fields,&quot; while the NPA&#x27;s experiments with urban insurrectionism led all of Mindanao to be labeled &quot;the laboratory of the revolution.&quot; In order to keep its large number of cadres supplied, the NPA depended heavily on local citizens for supplies, increasing the incidences of abusive behavior, and reducing support for their cause.

In 1984, rightwing vigilantes with the support of Philippine Constabulary Davao City Metropolitan Command commander Lt. Colonel Franco Calida, formed the armed group &quot;Alsa Masa&quot; (People&#x27;s Rise) to counter them. Their presence, coinciding infighting within the NPA triggered by a hunt for deep penetration agents, was perceived as reducing NPA presence in Davao, but at the cost of the Alsa Masa itself committing human rights violations.

Most Davao residents remained staunchly against violence from either extreme. Early examples had included the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Davao Antonio L. Mabutas, who was among the first religious leaders to peacefully speak out against the Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship. However, these peaceful citizens lacked the political clout to influence the situation much before 1983. One stabilizing element was the designation of then-Colonel Rodolfo Biazon as commander of the 3rd Marine Brigade assigned to Davao. In what the international press dubbed &quot;the most sophisticated approach&quot; to addressing the insurgency, Biazon eschewed the aggressive stance preferred by the Philippine Constabulary and instead focused on outreach and community engagement - visiting schools and communities, and assuring the public that any Marine would be disciplined for any abuses committed.

Ordinary citizens began to have more of a voice for change after the economic crisis of 1983, the assassination of Ninoy Aquino, and the murder of prominent Davao City journalist Alex Orcullo at a checkpoint in Barangay Tigatto on October 19, 1984. These seminal events prompted prominent city figures like Soledad Duterte to organize a protest group called the &quot;Yellow Friday Movement&quot;, which slowly gained support until 1986, when Marcos was finally ousted and forced into exile.

From various sectors such as the academe, there were other ordinary 

Numerous Davaoeños from various sectors of society are honored at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes which fought for democracy against the authoritarian regime. This includes:
* Fernando &quot;Nanding&quot; Esperon, a youth organizer who, as chair of Liga sa Kabatan-onan sa Davao (LIKADA) was investigating five extrajudicial killings attributed to the Alsa Masa, when he was accosted from a jeepney he was riding, shot in both knees, captured, and then found dead soon after having been riddled with bullets and then thrown off the Lizada Bridge over the Toril river.
* Atty Laurente &quot;Larry&quot; Ilagan, an alumnus of the Ateneo de Davao Law School who became a prominent Human Rights Lawyer with the Free Legal Assistance Group; 
* Eduardo Lanzona, an Economics Professor and Union Organizer who was arrested in Davao Del Norte and eventually killed by Marcos&#x27; forces in 1975; 
* Activist Maria Socorro Par who pushed for the restoration of the student council and school paper Atenews in the mid70s after they had been shut down in Martial Law, 
* Atenews Editor in Chief Evella Bontia; 
* Law School alumnus Nicolas Solana Jr., 
* ADDU High School alumnus Ricky Filio and Joel Jose.

=== After the People Power revolution ===
Because the local leaders of the time were closely associated with Marcos, they were removed by the 1986 revolutionary government which took power after Marcos&#x27;s ouster. President Corazon Aquino then appointed Soledad Duterte&#x27;s son, Rodrigo Duterte, as temporary Vice Mayor of Davao. Rodrigo Duterte later ran for Mayor of Davao City and won, taking the top city office from 1988 to 1998, from 2001 to 2010, and yet again from 2013 to 2016, after which he became President of the Philippines.

==Geography==
Davao City is approximately southeast of Manila over land, and by sea. The city is located in southeastern Mindanao, on the northwestern shore of Davao Gulf, opposite Samal Island. Mount Apo and Mount Talomo can be seen from here.

===Barangay===

Davao City politically subdivided into 182 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

===Topography===

Davao City&#x27;s land, totaling about , is hilly in the west (the Marilog district) and slopes down to the southeastern shore. Mount Apo, the highest peak in the Philippines, is located at the city&#x27;s southwestern tip. Mount Apo National Park (the mountain and its surrounding vicinity), was inaugurated by President Manuel L. Quezon (in &quot;Proclamation 59&quot; of May 8, 1936) to protect the flora and fauna of the surrounding mountain range.

The Davao River is the city&#x27;s primary drainage channel. Draining an area of over , the river begins in the town of San Fernando, Bukidnon. The mouth of the river is located at Barangay Bucana at Talomo District.

===Climate===
Davao has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;), with little seasonal variation in temperature. The areological mechanism of the Intertropical Convergence Zone occurs more often than that of the trade winds and because it experiences rare cyclones the climate is not purely equatorial but subequatorial. Average monthly temperatures are always above , and average monthly rainfall is above . This gives the city a tropical climate, without a true dry season; while there is significant rainfall in winter, the largest rainfall occurs during the summer months (see climate chart, below).
===Flora and fauna===
Mount Apo is home to many bird species, 111 of which are endemic to the area. It is also home to one of the world&#x27;s largest eagles, the critically endangered Philippine eagle, the country&#x27;s national bird. The Philippine Eagle Foundation is based near the city. Plant species include the orchid &quot;waling-waling&quot;, also known as the &quot;Queen of Philippine Flowers&quot; as well as one of the country&#x27;s national flowers, which are also endemic to the area. Fruits such as mangosteen (known as the &quot;queen of fruits&quot;) and durian (known as the &quot;king of fruits&quot;), grow abundantly on Mount Apo.

===Geology===
Despite Davao City&#x27;s location in the Asian portion of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the city has suffered few earthquakes and most have been minor. Mount Apo, southwest from the city proper, is a dormant volcano.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 census, the city has a total population of 1,776,949 people. Metro Davao, with the city as its center, had about 2.77 million inhabitants in 2015, making it the third-most-populous metropolitan area in the Philippines and the most-populous city in Mindanao. In the 1995 census, the city&#x27;s population reached 1,006,840 inhabitants, becoming the first city in the Philippines outside Metro Manila and the fourth nationwide to exceed one million inhabitants. The city&#x27;s population increase during the 20th century was due to massive immigration waves coming from other parts of the nation and the trend continues to this day.

===Ethnicities===

Residents of Davao City and the whole corresponding Davao Region are colloquially known as &quot;Davaoeños&quot;. Nearly all local Davaoeños, mostly descended from migrant settlers from Visayas in recent centuries and decades, are Visayans (the majority are Cebuanos, with the rest being Ilonggos (Hiligaynon speakers)) and the respective mestizos from those groups, while others of different ethnicities—especially the indigenous people, who are collectively categorized as Lumads—make up the remainder of the local population. The Davao City residents of non-Visayan ethnicity are mostly Tagalogs, Kapampangans, Ilocanos, and their respective mestizos from those groups, which are also descendants of migrant settlers from Luzon, particularly Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Ilocos Region, the Cordillera Administrative Region, and Cagayan Valley. The Moro ethnic groups of the city include the Maguindanaons, Maranaos, Iranuns, Tausugs and Sama-Bajaus. There are also historical and recent migrant Chinese Filipinos and Japanese Filipinos coming from other parts of the Philippines that have made sizable communities in Davao. Modern more recent migrants also include Indonesians, Malaysians, Chinese people (both from China and Taiwan), Japanese people, and Koreans, that have recently settled and made small communities in Davao City. Non-Asian foreigners, such as Americans and Europeans, are also present in the city in small numbers.

===Languages===
Cebuano is the most widely spoken language in the city and its satellite cities and towns, while Filipino (Tagalog) comes close as second most spoken casual language. English is the formal medium of instruction in schools and is widely understood by residents, who often use it in varying professional fields. Aside from the aforementioned languages, Chavacano Davaoeño and Hiligaynon are also spoken by a minority in addition to languages indigenous to the city, such as Giangan, Kalagan, Tagabawa, Matigsalug, Ata Manobo, and Obo. Other languages varyingly spoken as well in the city include Maguindanao, Maranao, Sama–Bajaw, Iranun, Tausug, Ilocano and Kapampangan. Philippine Hokkien and Japanese can also be heard privately spoken by Chinese Filipinos and Japanese Filipinos among their fellows in Davao, whereas Mandarin (Standard Chinese) and Japanese is also taught in Chinese class and Japanese class of Chinese Filipino schools and Japanese Nikkei Filipino schools.

A linguistic phenomenon has developed in the city whereby locals significantly mix Tagalog terms and grammar into their Cebuano Bisaya speech because of varying reasons such as, the normalcy of the older generations of Cebuano-speaking families speaking Tagalog to their children at home, some migrant settlers to the city are also from Luzon where Tagalog is mainstream, and the modern Filipino mass media is also mostly in Filipino (Tagalog) and Filipino class is also taught in schools in Davao, while Cebuano is spoken in other everyday settings, making Tagalog a secondary casual lingua franca.

===Religion===

The majority of Davao City&#x27;s inhabitants are Roman Catholic Christians, forming 78% of the population. The next largest religious affiliation is Islam at 4%. Other Christian groups, such as the Iglesia ni Cristo, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Pentecostal Missionary Church of Christ (4th Watch) and Kingdom of Jesus Christ, form eighteen percent of the city&#x27;s religious background. The Seventh-day Adventist Church, the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, the Philippine Independent Church and the Baptists constitute the city&#x27;s other Christian denominations. Some of the other faiths of the city are Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, animism and irreligion.

The Restorationist Church Kingdom of Jesus Christ had its origins in the city. Apollo Quiboloy, who claims to be the &quot;Appointed Son of God&quot;, is the leader of the movement.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Davao is the main metropolitan see of the Roman Catholic Church in southern Mindanao. It comprises the city of Davao, the Island Garden City of Samal and the municipality of Talaingod in Davao del Norte province; under its jurisdiction are the three suffragan dioceses of Digos, Tagum and Mati (the capital cities of the three Davao provinces). Archbishop Romulo Valles of the Archdiocese of Davao, appointed on February 11, 2012, by Pope Benedict XVI, took office on May 22, 2012, at San Pedro Cathedral. Saint Peter, locally known as &quot;San Pedro&quot;, is the patron saint of the city.

==Economy==

Davao is part of the East Asian Growth Area, a regional economic-cooperation initiative in Southeast Asia.

According to the foundation, the city has a projected average annual growth of 2.53 percent over a 15-year period; Davao was the only Philippine city to reach the top 100. As the largest city economy in Mindanao, Davao City also serves as the largest local economy in southern Philippines.

===Industry===
Agriculture remains the largest economic sector comprising banana, pineapple, coffee and coconut plantations in the city. It is the island&#x27;s leading exporter of fruits such as mangoes, pomeloes, bananas, coconut products, pineapples, papayas, mangosteens and cacao.

The chocolate industry is the newest development in the city. Malagos Chocolate, developed here by Malagos Agriventures Corp., is now the country&#x27;s leading artisan chocolate recognized worldwide. On the other hand, Seed Core Enterprises is the country&#x27;s biggest exporter of cacao to Barry Callebaut. Durian which is locally grown and harvested in the city, is also a notable export, although banana is the largest fruit export in the city. Local corporations like Lorenzo Group, Anflo Group, AMS Group, Sarangani Agricultural Corp. and Vizcaya Plantations Inc. have operations and headquarters here. Multinational companies like Dole, Sumifru/Sumitomo and Del Monte have their regional headquarters here also.
Davao Gulf provides livelihood for many fishermen. Some of the fish products include yellow fin tuna, brackish water milkfish, mudfish, shrimp and crab. Most of the fish catches are discharged in the fishing port in Barangay Toril, which are then sold in the numerous markets within the city.

The city also serves as the main trade, commerce, and industry hub of Mindanao and is also one of the financial hubs of Mindanao. Phoenix Petroleum is a multinational oil company based in Davao City and is the first company in the Philippines-based outside Metro Manila to be in the PSE Composite Index. Several industrial plants such as those of Coca-Cola Bottlers, Phil., Pepsi-Cola Products, Phil., Interbev Phil Inc. and RC Cola Phil., companies are located in the city. There is also a number of fruit packaging-exporting facilities, and food manufacturing plants as well as industrial construction plants such as Holcim Philippines, Union Galvasteel Corporation, and SteelAsia. The SteelAsia plant is now the largest and most modern steel rolling mill production facility in the country, completed in December 2014 and was purposely built to increase the national steel production and to reduce the construction costs in Mindanao.

===Commerce===
BDO Network Bank (formerly One Network Bank) is based in Davao City and is the largest rural bank in the Philippines in terms of assets. Most of its branches are located in Mindanao (including 17 locations where it is the only financial-services provider). Government social-insurance agencies such as the Social Security System and Government Service Insurance System also have locations in the city.
There are several commercial areas in the city: the city&#x27;s downtown area, also known as the city centre, Davao Chinatown (Uyanguren), Bajada, Lanang, Matina, Ecoland, Agdao, Buhangin, Tibungco, Toril, Mintal and Calinan, the latter three located at the southwestern part of the city.

==Culture and heritage==

===Foreign influence===

As with most cities in the Philippines, Christianity is widespread as a result of Spanish colonialism. Christian churches and chapels dot the city&#x27;s landscape. A small number of temples, mosques and other religions&#x27; places of worship may also be found around the city.

A notable tradition brought by the Spanish still celebrated today in Davao City is the celebration of the feast day of each of the barrios (villages) patron saints with a festival (&quot;fiesta&quot;). These are celebrated through song and dance.

The biggest celebration native to the city is the Kadayawan Festival in early to mid August which, in pre-colonial times was a celebration of the harvest. Today, it serves to commemorate the cultures of the indigenous tribes that inhabit the area surrounding Davao City. Many tribes people visit the city during this time. Festivities include native Mindanaoan street dances, motorcades featuring various clubs and social awareness groups based in the city and art exhibits in various locations featuring local artists and artisans.
The Davao Chinatown is the primary residence of the Chinese community in the city. It has its own seaport, the Santa Ana Wharf, which is also a part of Davao International Port.

Japanese cultural influence, like the Chinese, is also prominent in the city. The Japanese community was concentrated in Barangay Mintal in the District of Tugbok, Davao City. In fact, a Japanese cemetery and Japanese shrine is located there. Evidence of Japanese influence are still visible in Mintal. There are various Japanese-owned businesses in the city as well. Davao City is also home to Philippine Nikkei Jin Kai International School, a Japanese-administered educational institution.

Several foreign communities reside in the city, including Indonesians, Malaysians, Koreans and Indians. There are ESL schools for foreigners, and export-oriented industrial parks to entice Japanese and (South) Korean firms to set up shop in the city. However, there has been some cultural conflict over the integration of Koreans in the city, with then-city mayor Rodrigo Duterte complaining about their habit of smoking in public places.

===Heritage===
There are a number of cultural-heritage sites in the city, including the Davao Museum (in Insular Village, Lanang), the Mindanao Folk Arts Museum (Philippine Women&#x27;s College, Juna Subdivision, Matina), Davaoeño Historical Society Museum (at Magallanes and Claveria Streets) and the Philippine-Japan Museum (Matsuo Compound, Calinan). Japanese historical sites include the Japanese Tunnel (used by Japanese forces during World War II), the 20th-century Japanese cemetery (now located inside Mintal Public Cemetery in Brgy. Mintal) and the Furukawa Fiber Plant (used by Yoshizo Furukawa as an abacá and banana plantation).

===Cuisine===

The cuisine of Davao City features skewered and grilled meat dishes, but the most common dish served in the city is kinilaw, made from tuna, mackerel, or swordfish with cucumber (and sometimes radishes) and chili marinated in vinegar. &quot;Sinuglaw&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;sinugba&quot; (grilled) and &quot;kinilaw&quot; in the Cebuano language, is also a term for a dish in which diced, grilled pork belly is mixed with &quot;kinilaw&quot;.

Fruit dishes, snacks, and desserts are also popular, most made from durian and bananas. Durian also made appearance on Davao&#x27;s culinary scene.

==Tourism==
The Philippine eagle, the country&#x27;s national bird and considered the largest eagle in the world, is endemic to Davao. The orchid &quot;waling-waling&quot; and fruits such as durians, marang, rambutans, pomeloes and mangosteens are popular and generally cheaper in the city. Tourist destinations in the city include the Philippine Eagle Foundation and Nature Center, Mount Apo, Gap Farming Resort, the Davao Crocodile Park, Malagos Garden Resort, Eden Nature Park, and People&#x27;s Park in the city center which is popular for its sculptures of indigenous people and dancing fountain. Samal Island, a part of Metro Davao, is an island city situated immediately off the city&#x27;s coast in Davao Gulf, popularly known for its scenic beaches.

Two major annual festivals are held in the city: the &quot;Araw ng Dabaw&quot; (Day of Davao) on March 1 (The city&#x27;s incorporation day) and the Kadayawan Festival in August. Also celebrated in the entire month of December, Pasko Fiesta sa Davao is an integration of festive and competitive Christmas activities showcasing colorful lightings and array of decorations in barangays, public parks, roads and buildings, and a series of competitive performances. Another annual festival, the Torotot Festival, is held annually every New Year&#x27;s Eve. First organized in the last day of 2013 during the 2014 New Year&#x27;s Eve, it was organized as a recompense for the city firecracker-pyrotechnics ban; it includes a number of people simultaneously blowing party horns, locally known as &quot;torotots&quot;. It recorded a number of 7,568 people participating in the first event, aiming to break the world record set by Japan for the most people simultaneously blowing party horns.

During 2011, there were 1,075,000 recorded tourist arrivals in the city, totaled from 81,081 foreign travelers, 983,315 local citizens, and 10,604 balikbayans/overseas Filipino workers. Estimated tourist receipts were recorded at 12.81 billion pesos while estimated economic benefits were 28.19 billion pesos.

===Barangays===
The 182 barangays of Davao City are arranged according to the 3 legislative districts and 11 administrative districts of the city.

==Transportation==

===Land===
Popular modes of public transportation in the city are multicabs, jeepneys, tricycles, buses and taxis. Multicabs and jeepneys ply 82 designated passenger-vehicle routes around the clock. Tricycles ply routes beyond the main streets of the city. Taxis have several routes in and around Davao City. In mountainous areas, the &quot;habal-habal&quot; passenger motorcycle is the main mode of transportation

The city has the first taxis in the Philippines to accept payments from BancNet and MegaLink ATM and debit cards. The black taxis are linked to the Global Positioning System (GPS), and dispatching is done by computer.

The city offers a wide bus network to cities and provinces in Mindanao and as far as Pasay in Luzon, and Tagbilaran, Ormoc and Tacloban in the Visayas. The city is accessible by bus from several points in Mindanao such as Cotabato, Kidapawan, General Santos, Digos, Koronadal, Isulan, Tagum, Tandag, Bislig, Malaybalay, Valencia, Mati, Monkayo, Malita, Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Marawi, Butuan, and Surigao .

Construction and improvement of roads and bridges in the city are underway. The city&#x27;s third major road, the Buhangin Underpass, was completed in the first quarter of 2003. The Traffic Management and Computerization Scheme was implemented, considered one of the most modern in the country.

A monorail project, named the Davao People Mover, has been endorsed by the City Government to the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and Philippine National Railways (PNR).

A road project, dubbed Davao City Bypass, was expected to be completed in 2022. It aims to reduce travel time from 1 hour and 44 minutes via Pan-Philippine Highway and Diversion Road to 49 minutes via Davao By-Pass road. However, it was postponed until 2028.

The Davao City Coastal Road is intended to provide an alternative route to the Pan-Philippine Highway in the southern part of the city, which has been experiencing heavy traffic congestion. It will also serve as a costal shore protection and breakwater.

==== Mindanao Railway Phase 1 (Tagum-Davao-Digos section) ====
The first phase of the Mindanao Railway is a railway line connecting the cities of Davao Region: Tagum, Davao City, and Digos. The project is set to have 8 stations and a daily ridership of 130,000, but it hasn&#x27;t yet received funding from other countries or lenders. The project was supposed to be financed by the Chinese official development assistance, but it was taken away in 2023.

==== Davao Public Transport Modernization Project ====
Formerly known as the High Priority Bus System (HPBS), it includes the development of improved public transport operations that will cover the full urban area of the city. The project will overhaul the outdated services that provide a poor level of service in terms of coverage area, hours of operation, and passenger comfort and facilities. The project will introduce a city-wide bus-based public transport operating system, with improved and modern franchising mechanisms that ensure supply meets demand. This will be supported through traffic management improvements to prioritize bus services along a core network of around 110 kilometers (km).

The project involves delivering a modern, high-priority bus system for Metro Davao, wherein interconnected bus services will be prioritized along various inter-city routes. It will include 1,000 buses and 1,000 bus stops spread out in Davao City. Of the 1,000 buses, 300 will be electric articulated buses, 500 will be regular 12-meter buses, and 200 will be the smaller nine-meter buses. It has an allocated budget of ₱80 Billion

===Sea===

Davao is connected to other major cities of the Philippines by roll-on/roll-off inter-island ferries. The city is served by domestic passenger ferries at Sasa International Seaport and Santa Ana Wharf, the international seaports of the Port of Davao, the busiest port in Mindanao. The port is capable of servicing inter-island and international shipments. It is located in Davao Gulf and has two approaches, one at Pakiputan Strait between Davao and western Samal Island.

The Davao City and General Santos to Bitung, Indonesia sea connectivity route has also had just been started very recently. This route will enable traders from Mindanao to easily export goods and commodities like food and beverage, electronics and garments, beauty products, fertilizer, construction materials, agricultural inputs, tin cans and packaging materials up to North Sulawesi in Indonesia. The roll-on-roll-off (Ro-Ro) shipping service which will serve the route is Asian Marine Transport, a Philippine-registered shipping firm and operator of the Super Shuttle Ferry, Super Shuttle Roro, and Shuttle Fast Ferry vessels.

===Air===

Located north of the city center, Francisco Bangoy International Airport is the main airport serving the city and the region. It is also the main international airport in Mindanao. Around 1966, Philippine Airlines (PAL), the country&#x27;s flag carrier, began its first domestic jet service in the city. Since 2024, the airport has handled flights to 5 international destinations: Quanzhou, Singapore, and Doha.

==Utilities==
Davao Light and Power Company, an Aboitiz company which is the third-largest electric utility company in the country, serves the city&#x27;s electricity needs. It had its own gas-operating power plant at Bajada district and 300-megawatt coal-fired power plant in Toril district.

Davao City Water District is the main water supplier in the city. It obtains its water supply from the mountain springs in the city&#x27;s western portion as well as from underground or surface water sources. The city&#x27;s water supply runs through the company&#x27;s production wells, sumps and reservoirs within the city. Its biggest water supply system is located at Barangay Dumoy.

==Healthcare==
There are 31 hospitals and tertiary centers in the city like the United Davao Specialists Hospital and Medical Center, Inc. (Unidav), Davao Doctors Hospital, San Pedro Hospital, Brokenshire Medical Center, Ricardo Limso Medical Center, Davao Medical School Foundation Hospital (DMSF Hospital), Metro Davao Medical and Research Center, Adventist Hospital, MMG Hospital, CHDC Hospital and the Southern Philippines Medical Center. In addition, CURE International, a non-profit organization that operates charitable hospitals and programs worldwide, operates the Tebow CURE Hospital, which is an orthopedic specialty hospital located in Davao City. It provides elective surgeries to both children and adults. Their primary charitable mission is to heal disabled children with conditions such as clubfoot, bowed legs, other bone deformities, untreated burns and cleft lip. Ecoland Medical and Wellness Center (EcoMed), one of the first DOH-licensed private Primary Care Facilities in Mindanao, is located along Quimpo Boulevard in the southern part of the city. EcoMed offers primary healthcare and diagnostic services (laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy), a 24-hour Outpatient Department (that includes a Birthing Facility and Minor Operating Room) that can handle and treat minor and primary health emergencies, and a range of outpatient healthcare services through its Renal Dialysis Unit, Doctor&#x27;s Clinics (covering a range of specializations), and its Ambulatory Surgical Unit. 

Davao City is also noted and have been praised by the World Health Organization for its smoke-free policy since 2002, the first in the Philippines.

==Law and order==
Law and order is maintained by the Philippine National Police and a special military group, Task Force (TF) Davao. TF Davao is formed to protect the city from terrorist attacks and other crime and is affiliated with the Philippine Army and headed by an army colonel.

A curfew on minors is enforced. All businesses, especially bars and discos, are mandated by a city ordinance to stop selling alcoholic drinks at 1:00 am (final approval last July 24, 2013). Motorcyclists without helmets and motorists with defective lights are not legally allowed to enter (or drive in) the city. Executive Order No. 39 imposes the reduction of speed limits for all kinds of motor vehicles within the territorial jurisdiction of Davao City.

Former President Rodrigo Duterte, mayor of Davao for 22 years, has been credited with making Davao one of the world&#x27;s safest cities. Rights groups, however, claim that he cites this as justification for his national drug policy. Raw crime data from the Philippine National Police for the years 2010 to 2015 shows that the city had the highest murder rate in the Philippines, and the second-highest number of rapes.

In February 2018, the Davao City Council officially declared Senator Antonio Trillanes &quot;persona non grata&quot; after Trillanes portrayed the city as the most dangerous in the Philippines and likening Dabawenyos to North Koreans who are easily brainwashed by President Rodrigo Duterte. &quot;Safest city&quot; rankings are often cited from Numbeo, a crowd-sourced survey website; as of February 2018, Davao had dropped to 275th out of 330 cities in Numbeo&#x27;s &quot;crime index&quot;.

The Public Safety and Security Command Center (PSSCC), the first in the Philippines, is located in Sandawa, Matina. It is headquarters for 911 and the center for the 170 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed in different strategic areas as of today covering access roads and populated downtown areas, and also including outside the Francisco Bangoy International Airport and six in different bridges to monitor the rise of water level in the city&#x27;s rivers. The center also controls traffic signals in the city.

In Davao City, by city ordinance, police ensure that prostitutes have a valid health card, but do not arrest them, as prostitution is considered a health issue for the women involved and is not a police matter. Jeanette Ampog, the executive director of Talikala, a Davao-based NGO that helps prostitutes, said in October 2016 that child prostitution had sharply increased over the past two years. She said that children were cheaper and more marketable. Nevertheless, the city was awarded &quot;Most Child-Friendly City for Highly-Urbanized Category&quot; in 2013, 2014 and 2017. The city also won the same award in 1998 and 1999. Also in 2017, the city was awarded with the &quot;Best Disaster Risk Reduction and Management&quot;.

The city&#x27;s &quot;Executive Order No. 04, Series of 2013&quot; imposes an order on creating the implementation of rules and regulations for the new comprehensive anti-smoking ordinance no. 0367–12, Series of 2012. Davao City&#x27;s Firecracker Ban was also implemented with ordinance No. 060-02/1406-02, Series of 2002.

From 2015 to 2017, Davao City was among the local government units awarded with a &quot;Seal of Good Local Governance&quot; by the Department of the Interior and Local Government.

===Davao Death Squad===

The controversial Davao Death Squad is a vigilante group supposedly active in Davao City. The group is allegedly responsible for summary executions of street children and individuals suspected of petty crimes and dealing in drugs in Davao. It has been estimated that the group is responsible for the killing or disappearance of between 1,020 and 1,040 people between 1998 and 2008. An investigation in 2009 was later discontinued. Another investigation by the Office of the Ombudsman was opened and closed in 2019, stating that they found no evidence that the alleged group exists.

==Sports==

Sports facilities in the city include the Davao City Recreation Center (Almendras Gymnasium), Tionko Football Field (near Agro College and the Davao River) and the gymnasiums of Ateneo de Davao University, Philippine Women&#x27;s College of Davao&#x27;s Rosa Santos Munda Events Center (RSM Events Center), the University of Southeastern Philippines, Holy Cross of Davao College, the University of Mindanao, and Mintal Comprehensive High School. The main sports center of Davao City and also the largest is the Davao City Sports Complex, which hosted the 2019 National Games.

Locally based basketball teams such as &quot;Goldstar Davao&quot; and &quot;Duterte Agilas&quot; work for the Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association. Collegiate varsity teams based in the tertiary institutions inside the city also compete in national competitions. Despite being based outside of the city or province, the Davao Occidental Tigers of the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League (MPBL) normally play their home games in Davao City.

Sabong or cockfighting events are also held in cockfighting arenas within the city. In June 2015, the city held the country&#x27;s largest cockfighting event, the sixth Annual Thunderbird Challenge.

The locally based community network SouthSpot broadcasts only on cable television.

<text>The Israel Aircraft Industries Nesher (, &#x27;griffon vulture&#x27;, also translated to &#x27;eagle&#x27;) was the Israeli version of the French Dassault Mirage 5 multirole fighter.

Having sustained aircraft losses during the Six-Day War of 1967 and the War of Attrition fought during the late 1960s, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) sought to procure an improved variant of the highly successful Dassault Mirage III fighter aircraft. While a partnership to produce such an aircraft, the Mirage 5, was formed between French manufacturer Dassault Aviation and Israeli aerospace company Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), during January 1969, in response to the 1968 Israeli raid on Lebanon, the French government announced that it would be imposing an arms embargo on Israel. In response to the embargo, Israel decided to proceed with the venture, but to domestically manufacture the airframes instead.

During 1969, IAI commenced manufacturing work on the type. According to official accounts, Israel had already obtained a complete set of drawings and detailed information prior to the embargoes enactment. The Neshers&#x27; airframe was identical to the Mirage 5, but was refitted with Israeli-built avionics, a Martin-Baker zero-zero ejection seat, and provisions for a wider range of air-to-air missiles (AAMs), including the Israeli Shafrir heat-seeking missile. During September 1969, the first Nesher prototype performed its maiden flight. During May 1971, the first Raam A was delivered to the IAF. During November 1971, the aircraft was officially renamed as the &quot;Nesher&quot;. The high point of the Nesher&#x27;s career with the IAF was during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The type reportedly performed well during the conflict, IAF pilots flying the type cumulatively claimed over a hundred kills.

During 1974, production of the Nesher was phased out in favour of a more advanced Mirage derivative which had been planned in parallel to the Nesher, known as the IAI Kfir. The IAF retired the type during the 1970s. The aircraft were later sold to the Argentine Air Force, where they were operated under the name Dagger. During 1978, Argentina urgently deployed their first Daggers due to the Beagle conflict, a territorial dispute and war scare between Argentina and neighbouring Chile. Daggers were also used during the 1982 Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, conducting a total of 153 sorties against both ground and naval targets across the 45 days of combat operations. During their anti-ship attacks, they were reportedly responsible for damaging several vessels, including , , , , and . In total, 11 Daggers were lost in combat with the British, including 9 to Royal Navy Sea Harriers. The remaining aircraft were later upgraded into the Finger standard.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
During the early 1962, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) introduced the first of its Dassault Mirage IIICJ fighter aircraft. For the next two decades, it would be used as an air supremacy platform, securing the skies from hostile aircraft and achieving an impressive kill record during its service life. The performance of the Mirage IIICJ was soon regarded as being highly positive, leading to the type being considered as a strong contender for further development. During the late 1960s, the IAF came under pressure to acquire additional aircraft for the purpose of replacing in excess of 60 combat aircraft that had been lost during several conflicts between Israel and its neighbours, including the Six-Day War of 1967 and the War of Attrition which followed immediately and continued up to 1970. In addition, an arms race was emerging between Israel and several of its neighbours, such as Syria and Egypt, which were receiving increasingly advanced armaments from the Soviet Union during this time.

Accordingly, during July 1960, Israel had commenced work on a co-development effort with French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation to develop and produce a variant of their highly successful Mirage III fighter aircraft. This product of this programme became known as the Mirage 5 and it was eventually built by Israel and named Raam in Hebrew (thunder). Dassault had pursued the development of the Mirage 5 at the request of the Israelis, who were the main foreign customers of the Mirage III and generally favoured France as a military supplier during this era. Specific requirements established by the IAF for the next version of the type was to de-emphasis the aircraft&#x27;s all-weather capability and deleting its main radar system in exchange for improved ordnance-carrying capacity and range; this was made possible by the mostly-clear climate and typical weather conditions present in the Middle East.

Even prior to the prototype&#x27;s maiden flight, Israel placed an order for a batch of 50 aircraft, as well as a pair of trainer aircraft of the type, which were intended for the IAF. However, the programme was effectively derailed during January 1969 when, in response to the 1968 Israeli raid on Lebanon, the French government announced that it would be imposing an arms embargo on Israel and the &quot;warring nations of the Middle East&quot;. The enactment of the embargo prevented the delivery of the first 30 Mirage 5 aircraft, which were already paid for by Israel, in addition to options for 20 more of the type. In addition to preventing further deliveries, it also cut off all French support for operating the IAF&#x27;s existing Mirage IIICJ fleet. Strategically, the embargo gave a major impetus for Israel to develop the capabilities of its own domestic arms industry in order to meet its demands.

The embargo has been viewed as having been a considerable setback for the IAF, who had been keen to induct the new Mirage 5 variant to compensate for the losses incurred during the Six-Day War, the service was also continuing to use the Mirage IIIC, but found itself unable to access official support. In response to the French decision, Israel decided to domestically manufacture the airframes (known as Raam A and B project); reportedly, Israel already possessed the necessary schematics and documentation on the aircraft, although Israel did not officially obtain a manufacturing license from Dassault. According to aviation author Don McCarthy, it has been speculated that Israeli intelligence agency Mossad had played a role in obtaining some of the manufacturing information, while others allege that Dassault&#x27;s founder, Marcel Dassault, may have freely provided design information.

===Production===
According to aviation authors Doug Dildy and Pablo Calcaterra, Dassault discreetly provided the jigs, fixtures, and a large quantity of airframe components to Israel via an industrial consortium of Israeli aerospace company Israel Aircraft Industries and American aviation firm North American Rockwell, who were claimed to have been sold a manufacturing licence in January 1968. Reportedly, the first bare airframes, featuring no weapons, electronics, ejection seat, or engine included, had been delivered directly from Dassault in France. Dildy and Calcaterra claimed that detailed information on the aircraft&#x27;s Atar engine was obtained via Swiss industrial manufacturer Sulzer, who had produced the engine for Switzerland&#x27;s own Mirages; between these blueprints and possessing several Atar engines of the IAF&#x27;s existing Mirages to reverse engineer, Israel was able to independently manufacture its own engines.

During 1969, IAI commenced manufacturing activity on the project. Officially, Israel manufactured the aircraft after having obtained a complete set of drawings. However, some sources have alternatively claimed that Israel had received 50 Mirage 5s in a disassembled state and shipped in crates directly from the French Air Force (AdA), while the AdA proceeded to take on the 50 aircraft which had originally been intended for Israeli service. During September 1969, the first Nesher prototype performed its maiden flight. During May 1971, the first Raam A was delivered to the IAF. During November 1971, the aircraft received its official name of &quot;Nesher&quot;.

The Neshers&#x27; airframe was identical to the Mirage 5, but there was an extensive refitting of Israeli-built avionics systems, along with the adoption of a Martin-Baker zero-zero ejection seat, and improved provisions for a wider range of AAMs, including the Israeli Shafrir heat-seeking missile. In total, 51 Nesher fighters (Nesher S) and ten Nesher two-seat trainers (Nesher T) were constructed by IAI. The Nesher featured more simplistic avionics than the IAF&#x27;s Mirage IIIC, reportedly, it was also slightly less maneuverable. However, it possessed a longer combat range and a larger payload. The reduced maneuverability of the type did not prevent the Nesher from performing well in air combat during the Yom Kippur War of 1973.

During 1974, production of the Nesher was phased out in favour of a more advanced Mirage derivative which had been planned in parallel to the Nesher. The principal difference of this derivative was the replacement of the Atar engine by an Israeli-built General Electric J79 engine. The J79 was a popular American engine for combat aircraft, having already been used on fighters such as the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. The resulting aircraft was given the name IAI Kfir.

==Operational history==

===Israel===
During May 1971, the first Raam A was delivered to the IAF. Production deliveries continued until February 1974, by which point a total of 51 Nesher fighters and 10 Nesher two-seat trainers has been delivered to the IAF.

The high point of the Nesher&#x27;s career with the IAF occurred during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. The type reportedly performed well during the conflict, IAF pilots flying the type cumulatively claimed over a hundred kills. Shortly following the conflict, the decision was made to retire the Nesher. The introduction of the more capable Kfir derivative had diminished the importance of the Nesher, and their involvement in offensive operations had resulted in the airframes having rapidly aged as well. Following their withdrawal from service with the IAF, the majority of the remaining Neshers were refurbished and sold to Argentina, where the type was known as the &quot;Dagger&quot;.

===Argentina===
Following their retirement from IAF service, the remaining Israeli aircraft were refurbished and exported to the Argentine Air Force in two batches, 26 fighters were delivered in 1978 and 13 more in 1980, with fifty Rafael Shafrir IV air-to-air missiles. In Argentine service, the type was operated under the name Dagger (the English word); at its height, Argentina operated a total of 35 &quot;Dagger A&quot; single-seat fighters and four &quot;Dagger B&quot; two-seat trainers. During 1978, the Dagger was used to form a new unit, 6th Air Group; this unit was immediately enlisted with the support of the 8th Air Group (which operated the Mirage IIIEA) and the Peruvian Air Force, who was already an established user of the Mirage 5. The urgency of their initial deployment was a product of the Beagle conflict, a territorial dispute and diplomatic crisis between Argentina and neighbouring Chile during that year.
During the 1982 Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, Daggers were deployed to the southern naval airbase of Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego, and an airfield in Puerto San Julián. Despite the lack of an aerial refuelling capability and the considerable distance to their targets the type conducted 153 sorties against both ground and naval targets over the 45 days of combat operations.

They damaged several vessels in anti-ship attacks, including , , , and with cannon fire and and with bombs. Eleven Daggers were lost in combat, nine to AIM-9L Sidewinders fired from Sea Harriers, one by a Sea Wolf from HMS &quot;Broadsword&quot;, and another to a land-based Rapier. 

As part of the 1979 contract with IAI, the Argentine Air Force had stipulated that the Daggers would be equipped with new avionics and HUD systems, enabling them to conform to the Kfir C.2 standard (and beyond in some subsystems). The program, which was named Finger, was already underway in 1982 when the Falklands War broke out. Although the conflict was relatively brief, one consequence of the war was, as some of these systems were made by the British Marconi Electronic Systems, it became necessary to replace British-built systems after an arms embargo was imposed by the United Kingdom government. The work to replace such systems led to the aircraft being modified to the final &quot;Finger IIIB&quot; standard; this model primarily differed from the original &quot;Finger&quot; standard in the replacement of British-sourced equipment, often using French-made counterparts from Thomson-CSF.

<text>Army Group South () was the name of one of three German Army Groups during World War II.

It was first used in the 1939 September Campaign, along with Army Group North to invade Poland. In the invasion of Poland, Army Group South was led by Gerd von Rundstedt and his chief of staff Erich von Manstein.

Two years later, Army Group South became one of three army groups into which Germany organised their forces for Operation Barbarossa. Army Group South&#x27;s principal objective was to capture Soviet Ukraine and its capital Kiev.

In September 1944, Army Group South Ukraine was renamed Army Group South in Eastern Hungary. It fought in Western Hungary until March 1945 and retired to Austria at the end of the Second World War, where it was renamed Army Group Ostmark on 2 April 1945.

==Operation Barbarossa==

Ukraine was a major center of Soviet industry and mining and had the good farmland required for Hitler&#x27;s plans for &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&#x27;living space&#x27;). Army Group South was to advance up to the Volga River, engaging a part of the Red Army and thus clearing the way for the Army Group North and the Army Group Center on their approach to Leningrad and Moscow respectively.

To carry out these initial tasks its battle order included the First Panzer Group (Gen. Kleist) and the German Sixth (Gen. Reichenau), Seventeenth (Gen. Stülpnagel) and Eleventh Armies (Gen. Schobert), Luftlotte 1 (Keller) and the Romanian Third and Fourth Armies.

==Case Blue==

In preparation for Case Blue, the 1942 campaign in southern Russia and the Caucasus, Army Group South was split into two army groups: Army Group A and Army Group B. Army Group A was ordered south to capture the oil fields in the Caucasus.

In February 1943, Army Group Don and the existing Army Group B were combined and re-designated Army Group South. A new Army Group B became a major formation elsewhere. The German Sixth Army, which was destroyed in the Battle of Stalingrad, was re-constituted and later made part of Army Group South in March 1943.

By the end of December 1943, the strength of Army Group South had been reduced to 328,397 German soldiers, joined by another 109,816 allied soldiers and non-German volunteer troops.

On 4 April 1944, Army Group South was re-designated Army Group North Ukraine. Army Group North Ukraine existed from 4 April to 28 September.

In September 1944, Army Group South Ukraine was re-designated Army Group South. At the end of World War II in Europe, Army Group South was again renamed; as Army Group Ostmark, the remnants of Army Group South ended the war fighting in and around Austria and Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Army Group Ostmark was one of the last major German military formations to surrender to the Allies.

<text>Charanga is a traditional ensemble that plays Cuban dance music. They made Cuban dance music popular in the 1940s and their music consisted of heavily son-influenced material, performed on European instruments such as violin and flute by a Charanga orchestra. (Chomsky 2004, p. 199). The style of music that is most associated with a Charanga is termed &#x27;Danzón&#x27;, and is an amalgam of both European classical music and African rhythms.

==Origins==
&quot;Scholars agree that Spain and parts of West and Central Africa provided the most crucial influences in the development of Cuban popular and religious music. But in the case of charanga, the contributions of French and Haitian influences cannot be ignored. Charanga began its history in the early nineteenth century when Haitians, both African and French, escaped the island&#x27;s revolution. They brought with them a love for the French contredanse, a multi-sectional dance form that evolved into the danzón, the quintessential charanga style. Both were performed by an ensemble called an orquesta típica, a group with brass, woodwinds and timpani that performed outdoors. When the upper classes decided to dance indoors, the instrumentation was radically altered. The new ensemble was called charanga francesa. Although the word &quot;francesa&quot; literally means &quot;French&quot;, it was used in nineteenth-century Cuba more specifically as a name for Haitian Creoles. In the charanga francesa, flutes and strings replaced the brass and woodwinds of the orquesta típica, and a small drum kit called pailas (now called timbales) replaced the booming tympany. While the orquesta típica was raucous in a New Orleans jazz fashion, the charanga francesa produced a light and somewhat effete music. The French influence extends to instrumentation for the modern charanga is based on charanga francesa.&quot;

The first charanga francesa in Cuba was formed at the turn of the twentieth century, possibly by Antonio (Papaíto) Torroella (1856–1934), whose orchestra was active by 1894. These orchestras play lighter versions of the danzón without a brass section and emphasizing flutes, violins, and piano. The percussion was provided by &quot;pailas criollas&quot;, now known as timbales. The style continued into the 1940s with flautist Antonio Arcaño and his Maravillas (Morales 2003 p13). Charangas are still widespread today, though the danzón is considered old-fashioned.

<doc id="489417" wikidata="Q3623017" url="?curid=489417" title="Dōgojima">
<text>is one of the Oki Islands in the Sea of Japan.

The island, 241.58 km² in area, has a population of approximately 14,849 people. The island is administered by the town of Okinoshima in Shimane Prefecture. Much of the island is within the borders of Daisen-Oki National Park.

==Geography==
Dōgo Island is the largest of the Oki Islands. It is located approximately north of Honshu coast. The island is of volcanic origin, and is roughly circular, with an approximate diameter of , with its highest point at the summit of Mount Daimanji at above sea level.

The climate of Dōgo Island is classified as a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with very warm summers and cool winters. Precipitation is abundant throughout the year.

==History==
The Oki Islands have been inhabited since the Japanese Paleolithic era, and numerous artifacts from the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods have been found by archaeologists. Dōgo Island is mentioned in the Nara period chronicles &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki,&quot; and Dōgo Island was the location of the capital of ancient Oki Province.

Dōgo Island was used as a place of exile from the Nara period, but is well known as the place of exile for ex-Emperor Go-Toba, who died on Nakanoshima in 1239, and for Emperor Go-Daigo, who was exiled to Nishinoshima from 1331-1333 The island became tenryo territory directly under the control of the Tokugawa shogunate in the Edo period.

After the Meiji restoration, the Oki Islands became part of Tottori Prefecture in 1871, but were transferred to Shimane Prefecture in 1881.

In 1892, Lafcadio Hearn visited Dōgo Island, spending a month there, and writing about his experiences in &quot;Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan&quot;. Dōgo Island was visited by the American naturalist Charles Henry Gilbert in 1906.

A lighthouse was erected on Cape Saigō in the southeast of the island in 1921. This lighthouse remained the only lighthouse in the Oki Islands until the 1950s.

On October 1, 2004, the town of Saigō merged with three neighboring villages to unify the island under the administration of the new town of Okinoshima.

==Transportation==
Dōgo Island is connected by regular ferry service from Saigo Port to points on mainland Japan. Oki Airport connects the island with Osaka (Itami) Airport, and Izumo by air.

==Economy==
The economy of the island is based on agriculture and commercial fishing. Seasonal tourism also plays a role in the local economy.

<text>Sinclair Oil Corporation was an American petroleum corporation founded by Harry F. Sinclair on May 1, 1916. The Sinclair Oil and Refining Corporation amalgamated the assets of 11 small petroleum companies. Originally a New York corporation, Sinclair Oil reincorporated in Wyoming in 1976. The corporate logo featured the silhouette of a large green &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; dinosaur, based on the then-common idea that oil deposits beneath the earth came from the dead bodies of dinosaurs.

Sinclair was ranked as one of the largest privately owned American corporations. It owned and operated refineries, gas stations, hotels, a ski resort, and a cattle ranch.

==History==
Sinclair has long been a fixture on American roads with its dinosaur logo and mascot, an &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;.

===1916–1969===
During September 1919, Harry Sinclair restructured Sinclair Oil and Refining Corporation, Sinclair Gulf Corporation, and 26 other related entities into Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation. In 1932, this new entity was renamed Consolidated Oil Corporation. In 1943, it was renamed Sinclair Oil Corporation.

Near the beginning of the Great Depression, Sinclair sold the remaining interest in its pipeline subsidiary to Standard Oil Company (Indiana) for US$72.5 million (Standard Oil had purchased a 50% interest in the pipeline subsidiary in 1921). With these funds, including an additional US$33.5 million from an additional common stock issue, Sinclair retired several promissory notes and prepared to weather the Depression with the remaining supply of cash.

Between 1921 and 1922, Sinclair leased oil production rights to Teapot Dome in Wyoming without competitive bidding. This led to the Teapot Dome scandal.

At the same time, Sinclair Oil was approached by the Italian fascist government. Benito Mussolini&#x27;s government wanted to increase competition in the Italian oil market, which was controlled by the Italo-American Petroleum Society (SIAP), which in turn was fully dominated by Standard Oil. As the Teapot Dome scandal unfolded in the United States and reached the international press, Mussolini accelerated the negotiations, with a deal signed on May 4, 1924 (although without an official meeting, to avoid public outcry). Because of this, Sinclair Oil Company is known for having made &quot;large payments to leading Fascists — all acting as intermediaries for Benito Mussolini — in return for an exclusive monopoly to drill for oil on Italian soil and in the Italian colonies&quot;. The deal was reported in a press release by the Head of Government (Mussolini) issued on the night of May 15, 1924, and published by most newspapers on the following day. The press release assured the public that Sinclair Oil had been awarded its contract on a competitive basis and had provided guarantees it had no relations with the international oil trust. This case of corruption was reported by the anti-fascist politician Giacomo Matteotti - who was later kidnapped and killed by Mussolini&#x27;s newborn secret police, just before he could report his discoveries to the Parliament — in his posthumous article, published in the July issue of &quot;English Life&quot; (a magazine founded by Brendan Bracken): Matteotti accused Sinclair Oil of being a pawn of Standard Oil, as well as revealing &quot;grave irregularities concerning the concession.&quot; Matteotti&#x27;s theses were echoed in the notes of Epifanio Pennetta, who contributed to the preliminary investigation on the murder: &quot;To all appearances,&quot; companies like Nafta and Saper &quot;were in competition with the Sinclair company, while in fact they were in cahoots with Sinclair&quot; and added that Sinclair Oil was actually working &quot;in concert&quot; with Standard Oil.

During the Great Depression, Sinclair saved many other petroleum companies from receivership or bankruptcy and acquired others to expand its operations. In 1932, Sinclair purchased the assets of Prairie Oil and Gas&#x27; pipeline and producing companies in the southern United States, and the Rio Grande Oil Company in California. The purchase of Prairie also gave Sinclair a 65% interest in Producers and Refiners Corporation (or Parco), which Sinclair subsequently acquired when Parco entered receivership in 1934. Lastly, in 1936, Sinclair purchased the East Coast marketing subsidiary of Richfield Oil Company, which had operated in receivership for several years. Richfield then reorganized, resulting in the creation of the Richfield Oil Corporation. Sinclair was instrumental in transferring capital and managerial assets into Richfield. Thirty years later, Richfield merged with Atlantic Refining, located on the East Coast, forming Atlantic Richfield.

At the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1933–1934, Sinclair sponsored a dinosaur exhibit meant to play on the link between the formation of petroleum deposits and the time of dinosaurs, now a largely discredited misconception. The exhibit included a 2-ton animated model of a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;. The exhibit proved so popular it inspired a promotional line of rubber brontosaurs at Sinclair stations, complete with wiggling heads and tails, and the eventual inclusion of the brontosaur logo. Later, inflatable dinosaurs were given as promotional items. An anthropomorphic version appeared as a service-station attendant in advertisements. Some locations have a life-size model of the mascot straddling the building&#x27;s entrance.

In the early 1960s, Sinclair, along with Henry W. Peters and his son Eric Woods, developed the Turbo-S aircraft oils used for reliability in commercial jets, military jets, guided missiles and space exploration rockets.

At the New York World&#x27;s Fair of 1964–1965, Sinclair again sponsored a dinosaur exhibit, &quot;Dinoland&quot;, featuring life-size replicas of nine different dinosaurs, including their signature &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;. Souvenirs from the exhibit included a brochure (&quot;Sinclair and the Exciting World of Dinosaurs&quot;) and featured molded plastic dinosaur figurines. After the Fair closed, Dinoland remained as a traveling exhibit.

Two of the replicas (&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;) are still on display at Dinosaur Valley State Park near Glen Rose, Texas. Another, a model of a &quot;Trachodon&quot;, has been displayed at Brookfield Zoo outside Chicago, Illinois. A replica of a &quot;Triceratops&quot; is owned by the Kentucky Science Center in Louisville, Kentucky and after a 2022 restoration was mounted above their parking garage. The Ankylosaurus is at the Houston Museum of Natural Science&#x27;s Sugar Lands location. The Ornithomimus is at the Milwaukee Public Museum. The Stegosaurus is on display in front of the Visitor Center of Dinosaur National Monument in Utah. A copy of the Triceratops is also owned by the Smithsonian Institution and is on display as &quot;Uncle Beazley&quot; in the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C.

In 1955, Sinclair ranked 21st on the Fortune 500; by 1969, it had fallen to 58th.

===ARCO era===
In 1969, Sinclair merged with the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) after an attempted acquisition by the Gulf+Western Industries Corporation. Federal antitrust provisions required the new entity to divest itself of certain Sinclair assets. As a result, the East Coast operations of Sinclair were sold to BP. After the ARCO acquisition, many Sinclair stations in the Midwest continued to use the dinosaur logo and opted out of using ARCO&#x27;s &quot;diamond spark&quot; logo. Some northwest Sinclair stations partially retained the Sinclair brand for a time, using ARCO&#x27;s blue rectangular logo, including the &quot;spark&quot; graphic, but with the word &quot;Sinclair&quot; substituted for ARCO.

===Holding era===

In 1976, ARCO spun off Sinclair by selling certain assets to Robert (Earl) Holding. Assets divested in the spin-off included ARCO&#x27;s retail operations in the region bounded by the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, and the rights to the Sinclair brand and logo, resulting in many stations along Interstate 80 keeping the dinosaur logo. The ARCO stations in Texas, New Mexico, Illinois, and some portions of Oklahoma were not affected by the divestiture. They continued as part of ARCO until ARCO pulled out of those states in the 1980s.

Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Sinclair was the 94th-largest private company in the United States. There were 2,607 Sinclair filling stations in 20 states in the Western and Midwestern United States. As of 2010, the corporation operated two refineries—one in Casper, Wyoming, and one in Sinclair, Wyoming. Sinclair operated a third refinery in Tulsa, Oklahoma, until it was sold to Holly Corporation on December 1, 2009. Sinclair&#x27;s other operations included 1,000 miles of pipeline.

In the mid-2010s, Sinclair fuel stations began actively spreading across southern California, including Los Angeles, San Diego, and Fresno, with holders offering attractive deals for potential clients to make the switch from a private brand to the Sinclair name brand.

By 2018, Sinclair gas stations were widely distributed across the United States, with dozens of gas stations in California, Colorado, Iowa, Idaho, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming; smaller numbers in Arizona, Connecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, North Dakota, New Mexico, New York, Texas, and Washington; and a single station in Arkansas and Wisconsin.

Sinclair continued to use the green dinosaur, affectionately called &quot;Dino&quot;, and marketed all its products under the logo. Sinclair patented the gasoline additive SG-2000. The high-octane fuel blend was called &quot;Dino Supreme&quot; and regular gas was &quot;Dino&quot;, trade names used since 1961 when many oil companies still used trade names for their fuels instead of generic terms such as &quot;regular,&quot; &quot;premium,&quot; or &quot;unleaded&quot;. Before that time, Sinclair&#x27;s trade names for its gasoline products included &quot;Power X&quot; for high-octane fuel and &quot;Sinclair H-C&quot; for regular gas. Sinclair also has marketed products such as Dino, Dino Supreme, and Opaline motor oils.
In August 2021, HollyFrontier announced the acquisition of Sinclair Oil. A new company named &quot;HF Sinclair Corporation&quot; would be formed in 2022. Under the agreements, Sinclair Oil&#x27;s branded marketing business and all related commercial activities and its refineries and related operations and assets in Casper and Sinclair, Wyoming, would be combined with HollyFrontier. Sinclair Oil&#x27;s logistics and storage assets, including approximately 1,200 miles of pipelines, two crude oil terminals and eight light product terminals, would be combined with Holly Energy Partners (HEP). It was expected that the vast majority of Sinclair Oil employees would be invited to continue in their positions following the combination. The transaction did not include exploration and production assets owned by Sinclair Oil &amp; Gas Co.

====Sinclair Trucking Company====
Company-owned Sinclair Trucking provided distribution for Sinclair Oil fuels and other related products. Terminals were located in:
* Flagstaff, Arizona
* Denver, Colorado (Henderson, Colorado)
* Des Moines, Iowa
* Kansas City, Kansas
* Minneapolis, Minnesota
* St. Louis, Missouri
* Omaha, Nebraska
* Shawnee, Oklahoma
* Tulsa, Oklahoma
* Salt Lake City, Utah
* Casper, Wyoming
* Sinclair, Wyoming
* Carrollton, Missouri

====Grand America Hotels &amp; Resorts====
Sinclair also owned and operated Grand America Hotels &amp; Resorts, which has hotel properties in Salt Lake City, Utah; Flagstaff, Arizona; Cheyenne, Wyoming; Little America, Wyoming; and San Diego, California, in addition to the Sun Valley and Snowbasin ski resorts. These properties were not part of the sale to HollyFrontier, and continue to be owned by the Holding Family.

=== HF Sinclair Corporation ===
In March 2022, the sale to HollyFrontier was completed, and HF Sinclair Corporation traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol DINO.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Sinclair&#x27;s Dino&quot; balloon first appeared in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade in 1963, returning to the parade in 2015 after a nearly 40-year absence. The balloon is an honorary member of New York&#x27;s Museum of Natural History as of 1977. It is tall, long, and wide.

The Brontosaurus logo is parodied in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Cars&quot; franchise films as being the &quot;Dinoco&quot; gas station chain, perhaps an allusion to gasoline and its origin as a fossil fuel, as well as a portmanteau between the &quot;dinosaur&quot; in Sinclair&#x27;s logo and the suffixes of the &quot;Amoco&quot;, &quot;Conoco&quot;, and &quot;Sunoco&quot; franchises.

The TV series &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; featured several characters with names derived from fossil fuel companies. The main character and his family had the surname Sinclair.

Sinclair once had a service station in Montgomery, Alabama, in the Cloverdale neighborhood, that closed in the 1970s. That location was remodeled in 1992 into a restaurant named Sinclair&#x27;s in honor of the former neighborhood station. The ownership group also opened two other locations, one at Lake Martin and one on the eastside. The lake and Cloverdale locations were closed by 2018, while the eastside location has flourished for nearly 30 years as of 2023.

Joey Jordison, founding drummer of Slipknot, worked at a Sinclair&#x27;s garage in Urbandale, Iowa, where late at night the band would discuss their plans.

<doc id="489424" wikidata="Q6282885" url="?curid=489424" title="Joseph Ellicott">
<text>Joseph Ellicott (November 1, 1760 in Bucks County, Pennsylvania – August 19, 1826 in New York City) was an American surveyor, city planner, land office agent, lawyer and politician of the Quaker faith.

==Life==
Ellicott was born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania on November 1, 1760. He was the son of Quaker miller Joseph Ellicott (1732–1780) and Judith Blaker (1729–1809). Joseph&#x27;s siblings included older brother Andrew Ellicott (1754–1820), a fellow surveyor, and younger brother Benjamin Ellicott (1765–1827), a U.S. Congressman.

==Career==
In 1790, his brother Andrew Ellicott was hired by the federal government to survey the new federal district, where the new capital city of Washington was to be built. Joseph was Andrew&#x27;s chief assistant during the latter part of the survey. Joseph Ellicott was subsequently sent to Georgia to survey the boundary line, established by treaty with the Creek tribe.

===Holland Land Company===
He was then engaged to survey some property in western Pennsylvania which had been purchased by a group of Dutch investors, who had formed the Holland Land Company. He also extended the New York - Pennsylvania border westward. When the company purchased a huge tract of western New York (that became known as The Holland Purchase), Ellicott was hired in 1797 and was sent to perform the monumental task of surveying it. Ellicott spent two years (1798–1800) living outdoors in summer and winter, laying out the townships of the new land in order to complete the Great Survey of the land in October 1800.

In 1800, the principal agent of the company, Paul Busti, gave him a new position as their agent at their Land Office in Batavia, New York. From this office, for the next 21 years he supervised the sales of the tract, with his personal signature on many deeds. Ellicott was an observer for the investors at the Big Tree Treaty when the Senecas sold their rights to the land in Western New York.

In 1801, he laid out Batavia, New York, and in 1804 the village of Buffalo, and established mill sites and communities.

He advocated a canal to be built from the Hudson River to Lake Erie, and was among the Erie Canal Commissioners appointed in 1816 to supervise the canal construction, but resigned in 1818 due to ill health. The Erie Canal was finished in 1825. He also arranged for the contribution of more than of company land to this project.
As seller and land agent, Ellicott offered generous terms to the buyers, some of whom purchased farms for as little as 25 cents down. When some buyers could not make payments he often extended the terms and sometimes forgave interest if they had made improvements. He offered some selected parcels free upon condition that the buyer would establish a mill or an inn, to help stimulate growth in the area. In later years, Ellicott became the target of complaints by citizens who were unhappy with the land company.

Ellicott was held responsible for the state of New York&#x27;s decision not to buy up unsold land of the land company, and he retired in 1821. He then attempted to finance the purchase of the unsold land himself, but no one would join his venture, and he had to abandon the plan.

===Politics===
Ellicott was a presidential elector in 1804, voting for Thomas Jefferson and George Clinton. From March 1806 to June 1807, he was First Judge of the Genesee County Court.

==Personal life==
Ellicott never married. His final years were marred by serious mental problems. Family members had him admitted to Bloomingdale Insane Asylum in New York City, where he died in 1826 by hanging himself. Soon after his burial in New York City, he was exhumed and re-buried in Batavia, New York at the Batavia Cemetery.

At his death left an estate valued at about $600,000 ().

<doc id="489430" wikidata="Q749173" url="?curid=489430" title="Counting of the Omer">
<text>Counting of the Omer (, Sefirat HaOmer, sometimes abbreviated as Sefira) is a ritual in Judaism. It consists of a verbal counting of each of the 49 days between the holidays of Passover and Shavuot. The period of 49 days is known as the &quot;omer period&quot; or simply as &quot;the omer&quot; or &quot;sefirah&quot;.

The count has its origins in the biblical command of the Omer offering (or sheaf-offering), which was offered on Passover, and after which 49 days were counted, and the Shavuot holiday was observed. The Temple sacrifices have not been offered since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, but the counting until Shavuot is still performed. Shavuot is the only major Jewish holiday for which no calendar date is specified in the Torah; rather, its date is determined by the omer count.

The Counting of the &quot;Omer&quot; begins on the second day of Passover (the 16th of Nisan) for Rabbinic Jews (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform), and after the weekly &quot;Shabbat&quot; during Passover for Karaite Jews. According to all practices, the 49-day count ends the day before Shavuot, which is the &#x27;fiftieth day&#x27; of the count.

The &quot;omer&quot; (&quot;sheaf&quot;) is an old Biblical measure of volume of unthreshed stalks of grain, the amount of grain used for the Temple offering.

== Sources ==

The commandment for counting the Omer is recorded within the Torah in :

As well as in :

The obligation in post-Temple destruction times is a matter of dispute, as the Temple offerings which depend on the omer count are no longer offered. While Rambam (Maimonides) suggests that the omer count obligation is still biblical, most other commentaries assume that it is of a rabbinic origin in modern times.

== The count ==

As soon as it is definitely night (approximately thirty minutes after sundown), the one who is counting the &quot;Omer&quot; recites this blessing:

Then he or she states the &quot;Omer&quot;-count in terms of both total days and weeks and days. For example:
* On the first day: &quot;Today is one day of the omer&quot;
* On the eighth day: &quot;Today is eight days, which is one week and one day of the omer&quot;

The wording of the count differs slightly between customs: the last Hebrew word is either &quot;laomer&quot; (literally &quot;to the omer&quot;) or &quot;baomer&quot; (literally &quot;in the omer&quot;). Both customs are valid according to halakha.

The count is generally in Hebrew; it may also be counted in any language, however one must understand what one is saying.

The counting is preferably done at night, at the beginning of the Jewish day. If one realizes the next morning or afternoon that they have not yet counted, the count may still be made, but without a blessing. If one forgets to count a day altogether, he or she may continue to count succeeding days, but without a blessing.

==Symbolism==

In the rabbinic chronology, the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai happened on Shavuot. Thus, the omer period is one of preparation and anticipation for the giving of the Torah. According to &quot;Aruch HaShulchan&quot;, already in Egypt Moses announced to the Israelites that they would celebrate a religious ceremony at Mount Sinai once 50 days had passed, and the people was so excited by this that they counted the days until that ceremony took place. Homiletically, in modern times when the Temple sacrifices of Shavuot are not offered, counting the omer still has a purpose as a remembrance of the counting up to Sinai.

One explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah on Shavuot. The Sefer HaChinuch states that the Israelites were only freed from Egypt at Passover in order to receive the Torah. The Counting of the &quot;Omer&quot; demonstrates how much a Jew desires to accept the Torah in their own life.

According to Maharal, there is a symbolic contrast between the omer offering (offered on Passover) and the Shavuot sacrifice (&quot;shtei halechem&quot;) offered upon conclusion of the omer. The former consists of barley, which is typically an animal food, and represents the low and passive spiritual level of the Israelites immediately upon leaving Egypt; while the latter consists of wheat and represents the high and active spiritual level of the Israelites upon receiving the Torah.

In Israel, the omer period coincides with the final ripening period of wheat before it is harvested around Shavuot. In this period, the quality of the harvest is very sensitive, and can easily be ruined by bad weather. Thus, the omer period stresses human vulnerability and dependence on God.

According to Nahmanides, Passover and Shavuot effectively form one extended holiday, with the seven weeks of the omer paralleling the seven days of Passover or Sukkot, and the omer period paralleling Chol Hamoed.

==Karaite and Samaritan practice==

Karaite Jews and Israelite Samaritans begin counting the &quot;Omer&quot; on the day after the weekly Sabbath during Passover, rather than on the second day of Passover (the 16th of Nisan).

This is due to differing interpretations of , where the Torah says to begin counting from the &quot;morrow after the day of rest&quot;. Rabbinic Jews interpret the &quot;day of rest&quot; to be the first day of Passover, while Karaites and Samaritans understand it to be the first weekly Sabbath that falls during Passover. Thus, the Karaite and Samaritan Shavuot is always on a Sunday, although the actual Hebrew date varies (which complements the fact that a specific date is never given for Shavuot in the Torah, the only holiday for which this is the case). Historically, Karaite and Karaite-adjacent religious leaders such as Anan ben David, Benjamin Nahawandi, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, Musa of Tiflis (founder of a 9th-century Jewish movement in Babylon); and Malik al Ramli (founder of a 9th-century Jewish movement in the Land of Israel) concluded that Shavuot should fall out on a Sunday. This is also the opinion of Catholics and the historical Sadducees and Boethusians.

The counting of Karaite and Rabbinic Jews coincides when the first day of Passover is on the Sabbath. Samaritan Judaism has an additional difference: because the date of the Samaritan Passover usually differs from the Jewish one by approximately one lunar month, the Karaite and Samaritan counting rarely coincides, despite each beginning on a Sunday.

Ethiopian Jews traditionally had yet another practice: they interpreted the &quot;day of rest&quot; to be the &quot;last&quot; day of Passover, rather than being the first day (as in rabbinic tradition) or else the Sabbath (as for Karaites).

==Omer-counters==

&quot;&quot;Omer&quot;-counters&quot; () are devices which aid in remembering the correct day of the omer count. They are often on display in synagogues for the benefit of worshippers who count the &quot;Omer&quot; with the congregation at the conclusion of evening services. &quot;Omer&quot;-counters come in varying forms such as:
* decorative boxes with an interior scroll that shows each day&#x27;s count through a small opening
* posters and magnets in which each day&#x27;s count is recorded on a tear-off piece of paper
* calendars depicting all seven weeks and 49 days of the &quot;Omer&quot;, on which a small pointer is advanced from day to day
* pegboards that keep track of both the day and the week of the &quot;Omer&quot;.

Reminders to count the &quot;Omer&quot; are also produced for tablet computers and via SMS for mobile phones.

An omer counter from the 19th century in Lancaster, Pennsylvania is preserved at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.

== As a period of semi-mourning ==
The omer period has developed into a time of semi-mourning in Jewish custom.

Traditionally, the mourning is in memory of the death of Rabbi Akiva&#x27;s 24,000 students, as described in the Talmud. (According to the Talmud they died in a &quot;plague&quot; as punishment for not honoring one another properly, but the Sephardic manuscript of Iggeret of Rabbi Sherira Gaon describes them as dying due to &quot;persecution&quot; (&quot;shmad&quot;), and based on this some modern scholars have suggested that they died in the Bar Kokhba revolt.) Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (author of &quot;Aruch HaShulchan&quot;) postulates that the mourning period also memorializes Jews who were murdered during the Crusades, pogroms, and blood libels that occurred in Europe. The observance of mourning customs was strengthened after the Rhineland massacres and Cossack riots which occurred in the Omer period. In modern times, the Holocaust is generally included among those events which are memorialized, in particular Yom HaShoah is observed during the &quot;Omer&quot;.

Mourning practices are observed for only part of the Omer period, with different communities observing different parts. Some families listen to music during the week of Passover and then commence the period of mourning until Lag BaOmer. Some Sephardic Jewish families begin the period of mourning from the first day of the Hebrew month of Iyar and continue for 33 days until the third of Sivan. The custom among Jerusalemites (&quot;minhag Yerushalmi&quot;) is to follow the mourning practices during the entire Counting of the Omer, save for the day of Lag BaOmer and the last three days of the counting (&quot;sheloshet yemei hagbalah&quot;) prior to the onset of Shavuot. Many Religious Zionists suspend some or all of the mourning customs on Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut (Israel&#x27;s Independence Day). The extent of mourning is also based heavily on family custom, and therefore Jews will mourn to different degrees.

Lag BaOmer, the thirty-third day of the Omer, is considered to be the day on which the students stopped dying, so all the rules of mourning are lifted. Some Sephardi Jews, however, continue the mourning period up until the 34th day of the &quot;Omer&quot;, which is considered by them to be the day of joy and celebration. Spanish and Portuguese Jews do not observe these customs.

During the days of mourning, custom generally forbids haircuts, shaving, listening to instrumental music, or conducting weddings, parties, and dinners with dancing. Some religious Jews shave each Friday afternoon during the mourning period of the &quot;Omer&quot; in order to be neat in honor of the Shabbat, and some men do so in order to appear neat in their places of employment.

== Lag BaOmer ==

According to some Rishonim, it is the day on which the plague that killed Rabbi Akiva&#x27;s 24,000 disciples came to an end, and for this reason the mourning period of Sefirat HaOmer concludes on Lag BaOmer in many communities.

According to modern kabbalistic tradition, this day is the Celebration of Simeon ben Yochai and/or the anniversary of his death. According to a late-medieval tradition, Simeon ben Yochai is buried in Meron, and this association has spawned several well-known customs and practices on Lag BaOmer, including the lighting of bonfires and pilgrimages to Meron.

== Kabbalistic interpretation ==

The period of the counting of the &quot;Omer&quot; is considered to be a time of potential for inner growth—for a person to work on one&#x27;s good characteristics (&quot;middot&quot;) through reflection and development of one aspect each day for the 49 days of the counting.

In Kabbalah, each of the seven weeks of the &quot;Omer&quot;-counting is associated with one of the seven lower sefirot (Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod, Malkuth). Similarly, each day of each week is associated with one of these same seven &quot;sefirot&quot;, creating forty-nine permutations. The first day of the &quot;Omer&quot; is therefore associated with &quot;&quot;chesed&quot; that is in &quot;chesed&quot; (loving kindness within loving kindness), the second day with &quot;gevurah&quot; that is in &quot;chesed&quot; (might within loving kindness); the first day of the second week is associated with &quot;chesed&quot; that is in &quot;gevurah&quot; (loving-kindness within might), the second day of the second week with &quot;gevurah&quot; that is in &quot;gevurah&quot;&quot; (might within might), and so on.

Symbolically, each of these 49 permutations represents an aspect of each person&#x27;s character that can be improved or further developed. Recent books which present these 49 permutations as a daily guide to personal character growth have been published by Rabbi Simon Jacobson and Rabbi Yaacov Haber and David Sedley. The work &quot;Counting the Omer: A Kabbalistic Meditation Guide&quot; includes meditations, activities and &quot;kavvanot&quot; (proper mindset) for each of the kabbalistic four worlds for each of the 49 days.

The 49-day period of counting the Omer is also a conducive time to study the teaching of the Mishnah in Pirkei Avot 6:6, which enumerates the &quot;48 ways&quot; by which Torah is acquired. Rabbi Aharon Kotler (1891–1962) explains that the study of each &quot;way&quot; can be done on each of the first forty-eight days of the &quot;Omer&quot;-counting; on the forty-ninth day, one should review all the &quot;ways.&quot;

<doc id="489432" wikidata="Q338034" url="?curid=489432" title="Le Ventre de Paris">
<text> (1873) is the third novel in French writer Émile Zola&#x27;s twenty-volume series &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot;. It is set in and around Les Halles, the enormous, busy central market of 19th-century Paris. Les Halles, rebuilt in cast iron and glass during the Second Empire was a landmark of modernity in the city, the wholesale and retail center of a thriving food industry. (translated into English under many variant titles but literally meaning &quot;The Belly of Paris&quot;) is Zola&#x27;s first novel entirely on the working class.

The protagonist is Florent, an escaped political prisoner mistakenly arrested after the French coup of 1851. He returns to his half-brother Quenu, a charcutier and his wife Lisa Quenu (formerly Macquart), with whom he finds refuge. They get him a job in the market as a fish inspector. After getting mixed up in an ineffectual socialist plot against the Empire, Florent is arrested and deported again.
Although Zola had yet to hone his mastery of working-class speech and idioms displayed to such good effect in &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot;, the novel conveys a powerful atmosphere of life in the great market halls and of working class suffering. There are a number of vivid descriptive passages, the most famous of which, his description of the olfactory sensations experienced upon entering a cheese shop, has become known as the &quot;Cheese Symphony&quot; due to its ingenious orchestral metaphors. Throughout the book, the painter Claude Lantier, a relative of the Macquarts and later the protagonist of &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre&quot; (1886) - shows up to provide a semi-authorial commentary, playing the role of chorus.

==Translations==
&quot;Le ventre de Paris&quot; was originally translated into English by Henry Vizetelly and published in 1888 under the title &quot;Fat and Thin&quot;. After Vizetelly&#x27;s imprisonment for obscene libel the novel was one of those revised and expurgated by his son, Ernest Alfred Vizetelly; this mutilated version entitled &quot;The Fat and the Thin&quot; appeared in 1896 and has been reprinted many times. Until 2007 this remained the only English version widely available. Henry&#x27;s original full edition was afterward reprinted in Paris for adventurous English readers. The novel was newly translated in 1955 by David Hughes and Marie-Jacqueline Mason for Elek Books under the title &quot;Savage Paris&quot; but this has long been out of print. Oxford World&#x27;s Classics published a new translation by Brian Nelson entitled &quot;The Belly of Paris&quot; in 2007 and Modern Library published a new translation by Mark Kurlansky in 2009.

<doc id="489440" wikidata="Q839832" url="?curid=489440" title="Curvature form">
<text>In differential geometry, the curvature form describes curvature of a connection on a principal bundle. The Riemann curvature tensor in Riemannian geometry can be considered as a special case.

==Definition==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a Lie group with Lie algebra formula_1, and &quot;P&quot; → &quot;B&quot; be a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle. Let ω be an Ehresmann connection on &quot;P&quot; (which is a formula_1-valued one-form on &quot;P&quot;). 

Then the curvature form is the formula_1-valued 2-form on &quot;P&quot; defined by

:formula_4

(In another convention, 1/2 does not appear.) Here formula_5 stands for exterior derivative, formula_6 is defined in the article &quot;Lie algebra-valued form&quot; and &quot;D&quot; denotes the exterior covariant derivative. In other terms,
:formula_7
where &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; are tangent vectors to &quot;P&quot;.

There is also another expression for Ω: if &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; are horizontal vector fields on &quot;P&quot;, then
:formula_8
where &quot;hZ&quot; means the horizontal component of &quot;Z&quot;, on the right we identified a vertical vector field and a Lie algebra element generating it (fundamental vector field), and formula_9 is the inverse of the normalization factor used by convention in the formula for the exterior derivative.

A connection is said to be flat if its curvature vanishes: Ω = 0. Equivalently, a connection is flat if the structure group can be reduced to the same underlying group but with the discrete topology.

===Curvature form in a vector bundle===
If &quot;E&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a vector bundle, then one can also think of ω as a matrix of 1-forms and the above formula becomes the structure equation of E. Cartan:

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the wedge product. More precisely, if formula_12 and formula_13 denote components of ω and Ω correspondingly, (so each formula_12 is a usual 1-form and each formula_13 is a usual 2-form) then

:formula_16

For example, for the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold, the structure group is O(&quot;n&quot;) and Ω is a 2-form with values in the Lie algebra of O(&quot;n&quot;), i.e. the antisymmetric matrices. In this case the form Ω is an alternative description of the curvature tensor, i.e.

:formula_17

using the standard notation for the Riemannian curvature tensor.

==Bianchi identities==
If formula_18 is the canonical vector-valued 1-form on the frame bundle, the torsion formula_19 of the connection form formula_20 is the vector-valued 2-form defined by the structure equation

:formula_21

where as above &quot;D&quot; denotes the exterior covariant derivative.

The first Bianchi identity takes the form

:formula_22

The second Bianchi identity takes the form

:formula_23

and is valid more generally for any connection in a principal bundle.

The Bianchi identities can be written in tensor notation as:
formula_24

The contracted Bianchi identities are used to derive the Einstein tensor in the Einstein field equations, a key component in the general theory of relativity.

<text>The Dassault Mirage 5 is a French supersonic attack aircraft/fighter-bomber designed by Dassault Aviation during the 1960s and manufactured in France and other countries. It was derived from Dassault&#x27;s popular Mirage III fighter and spawned several variants of its own, including the IAI Kfir. In Pakistan&#x27;s service, the Mirage 5s are modified and are capable of nuclear weapons delivery.

==Design and development==

===Early development===
The Mirage 5 grew out of a request to Dassault from the Israeli Air Force. Since the weather over the Middle East is clear and sunny most of the time, the Israelis suggested removing the air intercept radar and its avionics, normally located behind the cockpit, from the standard Mirage IIIE to reduce cost and maintenance, and replacing them with more fuel storage for attack missions. In September 1966, the Israelis placed an order for 50 of the new aircraft. Due to customer preference some variants of the Mirage 5 were radar-equipped.

===Mirage 5===

The first Mirage 5 flew on 19 May 1967. It looked much like the Mirage III, except that it had a long slender nose that extended the aircraft&#x27;s length by about half a metre. A pitot tube was distinctively moved from the tip of the nose to below the nose in the majority of Mirage 5 variants. The Mirage 5 retained the IIIE&#x27;s twin DEFA guns, but added two additional pylons, for a total of seven. Maximum warload was 4,000 kg (8,800 lb). Provision for the SEPR rocket engine was deleted. Rising tensions in the Middle East led French President Charles de Gaulle to embargo the Israeli Mirage 5s on 3 June 1967. The Mirages continued to roll off the production line, even though they were embargoed, and by 1968 the batch was complete and the Israelis had provided final payments. In late 1969, the Israelis, who had pilots in France testing the aircraft, requested that the aircraft be transferred to Corsica, in theory to allow them to continue flight training during the winter. The French government became suspicious when the Israelis also tried to obtain long-range fuel tanks and cancelled the move. The Israelis finally gave up trying to acquire the aircraft and accepted a refund.
Some sources claim that cooperation with France resumed outside the public&#x27;s eye and Israel received 50 Mirage 5s in crates from the French Air Force, while the French took over the 50 aircraft originally intended for Israel, as Mirage 5Fs. Officially, Israel claimed to have built the aircraft after obtaining complete blueprints, naming them IAI Nesher.

Like the Mirage IIIE, the Mirage 5 was popular with export customers, with different export variants fitted with a wide range of different avionics. While the Mirage 5 had been originally oriented to the clear-weather attack role, with some avionic fits it was refocused to the air-combat mission. As electronic systems became more compact and powerful, it was possible to provide the Mirage 5 with increased capability, even though the rear avionics bay had been deleted, therefore in some sub-versions, the result was a &quot;reinvented&quot; Mirage IIIE.

Reconnaissance and two-seat versions of the Mirage 5 were sold, with the designation Mirage 5R, and Mirage 5D respectively.

The Mirage 5 was sold to Abu Dhabi, Belgium, Colombia, Egypt, Gabon, Libya, Pakistan, Peru, Venezuela, and Zaire, with the usual list of subvariant designations and variations in kit. The Belgian aircraft were fitted with mostly US avionics, and some Egyptian aircraft were fitted with the MS2 attack avionics system from the Dassault-Dornier Alpha Jet.

In 1982, Pakistan Chief of Air Staff ACM Anwar Shamim acquired an additional squadron of the Mirage 5 from France to provide effective support to the Navy.

In 1978 and 1980, Israel sold a total of 35 of their Neshers plus 4 Nesher trainer aircraft (Nesher Ts) to Argentina, where they were locally known first as Daggers and after their upgrade as Fingers. The Argentines lost two Mirage IIIEAs and twelve Daggers during the Falklands War in 1982. As a measure of solidarity, the Peruvians transferred ten of their Mirage 5Ps to Argentina, under the name Mirage Mara, to help alleviate its losses.

South Africa purchased five Nesher trainers for trials during its own &quot;Atlas Cheetah&quot; fighter programme. All the aircraft were eventually upgraded to Cheetah D standard.

Chile incorporated some Mirage 5s under name Mirage Elkan.

A total of 582 Mirage 5s were built, including 51 Israeli Neshers.

==== Belgian production ====
In 1968, the Belgian government ordered 106 Mirage 5s from Dassault. All aircraft but the first one of each variant were to be license-built by SABCA in Belgium. Component production at the SABCA Haren plant near Brussels was followed by assembly at the SABCA plant at Gosselies airfield, near Charleroi. The ATAR engines were produced by FN Moteurs at this company&#x27;s Liège plant. SABCA production included three versions: Mirage 5BA for the ground-attack role, Mirage 5BR for the reconnaissance role and Mirage 5BD for training and conversion.

By the end of the 1980s, a MIRage Safety Improvement Program (MIRSIP) was agreed to by parliament, calling for 20 low-time Mirages (15 Mirage 5BAs and 5 Mirage 5BDs) to be upgraded. Initial plans included a new more powerful engine, but this idea was abandoned to limit cost. The upgrade eventually included a more modern cockpit, a new ejection seat, a laser rangefinder, and canards to improve takeoff performance and overall maneuverability. A new government canceled the MIRSIP but SABCA was allowed to carry out the update, in order to sell the aircraft on the export market. After completion, the Belgian government sold all 20 aircraft to Chile, together with 4 non-upgraded Mirage 5BRs, and one non-upgraded Mirage 5BD.

===Mirage 50===
The development and subsequent installation of the new Atar 9K50 engine led to the next Mirage variant, the Mirage 50, during the 1970s. The uprated engine gave the Mirage 50 better takeoff and climb characteristics than its predecessors. The Mirage 50 also incorporated new avionics, such as a Cyrano IV radar system. However, despite these upgrades, it did not prove popular in export sales as the Mirage 5 itself was becoming obsolete.

Chile ordered a quantity of Mirage 50s, receiving both new production as well as updated Armée de l&#x27;Air Mirage 5s. The Chilean aircraft were later modernised along the lines of the IAI Kfir and were called the ENAER Pantera. The Pantera incorporates fixed canards and other aerodynamic improvements, as well as advanced avionics, an in-flight refuelling probe, a reinforced landing gear, and two additional harpoints under the fuselage. These aircraft have an extended nose to accommodate some of the new systems.

In the early 1990s, Dassault upgraded a batch of Venezuelan Mirage IIIEVs and 5s to Mirage 50 standards, in addition to some newly built aircraft.

===Mirage 5 ROSE===
In the 1990s, the PAF launched a Mid-life update (MLU) program, codenamed as Project ROSE (Retrofit Of Strike Element), to its Mirage III and Mirage 5 aircraft with modern avionics provided by French, Italian, and Pakistani companies. The PAF acquired blueprint drawings of the aircraft from France, redeveloping and redesigning it at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.

In the first phase of the project, former Royal Australian Air Force Mirage III fighters received a modernisation designated &quot;ROSE I&quot;. Mirage 5Fs were also bought in the late 1990s from the French Air Force. Twenty of them were upgraded with new cockpit equipments including multifunction displays and a head-up display, navigation/attack suites, defensive aids systems, encrypted radios, a radar altimeter and a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor under the aircraft&#x27;s nose, under the ROSE II program.

Additionally, 14 Mirage 5Fs were similarly upgraded but with newer systems, under a program designated ROSE III. The FLIR sensors enable the Mirage 5 ROSE fighters to specialise in the night-time attack role.

== Operational history ==
=== Belgium ===
During the 1991 Gulf War, 18 Belgian Mirage 5s were deployed to Turkey alongside German Alpha Jets and Italian F-104s under a NATO-based operation to protect Turkey against potential Iraqi attacks.
=== Pakistan ===
In February 2019, IAF jets violated Pakistani airspace and bombed a wooded area in Balakot.
Resultantly, Pakistan launched retaliatory airstrikes (Codenamed &quot;Operation Swift Retort&quot;) on military installations at Indian Administered Kashmir. During the airstrikes, two Dassault Mirage-5PAs from the No. 15 Squadron dropped their H-4 SOW glide bombs which were guided to their specific targets by Weapon System Officers seated in Dassault Mirage-IIIDAs via data link. The operation was a success and the aircraft returned safely.

<text>The Plymouth Company, officially known as the Virginia Company of Plymouth, was a company chartered by King James in 1606 along with the Virginia Company of London with responsibility for colonizing the east coast of America between latitudes 38° and 45° N.

== History ==
The Plymouth Company was funded by wealthy investors from Plymouth, Bristol, and Exeter such as Sir John Popham and Sir Ferdinando Gorges. Competition between the two branches with overlapping territory was intended to motivate efficient settlement, but only the Virginia Company succeeded in establishing a permanent colony. 

The Virginia Company emerged at a time when European empires chartered corporations for their imperial efforts. The English East India Company and Dutch East India Company had both recently received royal charters by their governments. The Virginia Company represented a new strategy that relied less on protected trade and ports: settler colonialism. Many of these early colonists sought to establish lasting communities with political institutions, as developed in Jamestown.

The merchants (with George Popham named in the patent) agreed to finance the settlers’ trip in return for repayment of their expenses plus interest out of the profits made. The Plymouth Company established the one-year Popham Colony in present-day Maine in 1607, the northern answer to Jamestown Colony. Two ships, the &quot;Gift of God&quot; and &quot;Mary and John&quot;, arrived in August 1607 with around 100 settlers. The colony was led by George Popham, nephew of Sir John Popham, and Raleigh Gilbert, nephew of Sir Walter Raleigh.

== Decline ==
Popham Colony fared better than Jamestown in the cold winter of 1607, and their president, George Popham, was the only colonist who died. Fifty colonists returned to England that December. Leadership fell to second-in-command Raleigh Gilbert for six months, until a supply ship in autumn 1608 brought news that he had inherited a title and land in England following his brother&#x27;s death. The ship also brought news about the death of Sir John Popham, a major investor in the Plymouth Company. When Gilbert left for England on the returning ship, the discouraged colonists followed him, abandoning Popham Colony.

Beyond crises of leadership, the colony faced poor relationships with local Native Americans and were unable to trade with nearby tribes. The colony was also burdened with few natural resources to exploit and few skilled workers to take advantage of them. Even their time of arrival, two months later than the settlers of Jamestown, gave them less time to prepare for the harsh Maine winter. Unlike Jamestown, colonists abandoned Popham Colony before they found a resource or product to profit from. They did, however, produce the first ship built by English colonists in the Americas, the &quot;Virginia of Sagadahoc&quot;. Despite failing to establish a permanent settlement, the knowledge of local peoples and geography proved useful for future colonial endeavors under the Council for New England.

The Popham Colony was abandoned in 1608. In 1620, after years of disuse, the Plymouth Company was revived and reorganized as the Plymouth Council for New England with a new charter, the New England Charter of 1620. The Plymouth Company had 40 patentees at that point, and established the Council for New England to oversee their efforts, but it stopped operating in 1624.

The Council for New England was not dissolved until 1635 and issued several patents after 1624, including one to John Mason for New Hampshire and to New Plymouth Colony with the Bradford patent of 1630.

<text>Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur radio-based system for real time digital communications of information of immediate value in the local area. Data can include object Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, non-directional beacon, weather station telemetry, text messages, announcements, queries, and other telemetry. APRS data can be displayed on a map, which can show stations, objects, tracks of moving objects, weather stations, search and rescue data, and direction finding data.

APRS data is typically transmitted on a single shared frequency (depending on country) to be repeated locally by area relay stations (digipeaters) for widespread local consumption. In addition, all such data are typically ingested into the APRS Internet System (APRS-IS) via an Internet-connected receiver (IGate) and distributed globally for ubiquitous and immediate access. Data shared via radio or Internet are collected by all users and can be combined with external map data to build a shared live view.

APRS was developed from the late 1980s forward by Bob Bruninga, call sign WB4APR, a senior research engineer at the United States Naval Academy. He maintained the main APRS Web site until his death in 2022. The initialism &quot;APRS&quot; was derived from his call sign.


==History==
Bob Bruninga, a senior research engineer at the United States Naval Academy, implemented the earliest ancestor of APRS on an Apple II computer in 1982. This early version was used to map high frequency Navy position reports. The first use of APRS was in 1984, when Bruninga developed a more advanced version on a VIC-20 for reporting the position and status of horses in a endurance run.

During the next two years, Bruninga continued to develop the system, which he then called the Connectionless Emergency Traffic System (CETS). Following a series of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) exercises using CETS, the system was ported to the IBM Personal Computer. During the early 1990s, CETS (then known as the Automatic Position Reporting System) continued to evolve into its current form.

As GPS technology became more widely available, &quot;Position&quot; was replaced with &quot;Packet&quot; to better describe the more generic capabilities of the system and to emphasize its uses beyond mere position reporting.

Bruninga has also stated that APRS was not meant to be a vehicle position tracking system, and can be interpreted rather as &quot;Automatic Presence Reporting System&quot;.

==Network overview==
APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System), is a digital communications protocol for exchanging information among a large number of stations covering a large (local) area, often referred to as &quot;IP-ers&quot;. As a multi-user data network, it is quite different from conventional packet radio. Rather than using connected data streams where stations connect to each other and packets are acknowledged and retransmitted if lost, APRS operates entirely in an unconnected broadcast fashion, using unnumbered AX.25 frames.

APRS packets are transmitted for all other stations to hear and use. Packet repeaters, called digipeaters, form the backbone of the APRS system, and use store and forward technology to retransmit packets. All stations operate on the same radio channel, and packets move through the network from digipeater to digipeater, propagating outward from their point of origin. All stations within radio range of each digipeater receive the packet. At each digipeater, the packet path is changed. The packet will be repeated through only a certain number of digipeaters — or hops — depending upon the all-important &quot;PATH&quot; setting.

Digipeaters keep track of the packets they forward for a period of time, thus preventing duplicate packets from being retransmitted. This keeps packets from circulating in endless loops inside the ad hoc network. Eventually, most packets are heard by an APRS Internet Gateway, called an IGate, and the packets are routed on to the Internet APRS backbone (where duplicate packets heard by other IGates are discarded) for display or analysis by other users connected to an APRS-IS server, or on a Web site designed for the purpose.

While it would seem that using unconnected and unnumbered packets without acknowledgment and retransmission on a shared and sometimes congested channel would result in poor reliability due to a packet being lost, this is not the case, because the packets are transmitted (broadcast) to everyone and multiplied many times over by each digipeater. This means that all digipeaters and stations in range get a copy, and then proceed to broadcast it to all other digipeaters and stations within their range. The result is that packets are multiplied more than they are lost. Therefore, packets can sometimes be heard some distance from the originating station. Packets can be digitally repeated tens of kilometers or even hundreds of kilometers, depending on the height and range of the digipeaters in the area.

When a packet is transmitted, it is duplicated many times as it radiates out, taking all available paths simultaneously, until the number of &quot;hops&quot; allowed by the path setting is consumed.

==Positions/objects/items==
APRS contains a number of packet types, including position/object/item, status, messages, queries, weather reports and telemetry. The position/object/item packets contain the latitude and longitude, and a symbol to be displayed on the map, and have many optional fields for altitude, course, speed, radiated power, antenna height above average terrain, antenna gain, and voice operating frequency. Positions of fixed stations are configured in the APRS software. Moving stations (portable or mobile) automatically derive their position information from a GPS receiver connected to the APRS equipment.

The map display uses these fields to plot communication range of all participants and facilitate the ability to contact users during both routine and emergency situations. Each position/object/item packet can use any of several hundred different symbols. Position/objects/items can also contain weather information or can be any number of dozens of standardised weather symbols. Each symbol on an APRS map can display many attributes, discriminated either by colour or other technique. These attributes are:

* Moving or fixed
* Dead-reckoned or old
* Message capable or not
* Station, object or item
* Own object or other station object/item
* Emergency, priority, or special

==Status/messages==
The Status packet is free-field format that lets each station announce its current mission or application or contact information or any other information or data of immediate use to surrounding activities. The message packet can be used for point-to-point messages, bulletins, announcements or even email. Bulletins and Announcements are treated specially and displayed on a single &quot;community Bulletin board&quot;. This community bulletin board is fixed size and all bulletins from all posters are sorted onto this display. The intent of this display is to be consistent and identical for all viewers so that all participants are seeing the same information at the same time. Since lines are sorted onto the display, then individual posters can edit, update, or delete individual lines of their bulletins at any time to keep the bulletin board up-to-date to all viewers.

All APRS messages are delivered live in real-time to online recipients. Messages are not stored and forwarded, but retried until timed out. The delivery of these messages is global, since the APRS-IS distributes all packets to all other IGates in the world and those that are messages will actually go back to RF via any IGate that is near the intended recipient.

=== Email ===
A special case message can be sent to EMAIL where these messages are pulled off the real-time APRS-IS and wrapped into a standard email message type, and forwarded into regular Internet email. This was done by the WU2Z email engine until 2019 , when it was replaced by the javAPRSSrvr email gateway.

==Capabilities==
In its simplest implementation, APRS is used to transmit real-time data, information and reports of the exact location of a person or object via a data signal sent over amateur radio frequencies. In addition to real-time position reporting capabilities using attached GPS receivers, APRS is also capable of transmitting a wide variety of data, including weather reports, short text messages, radio direction finding bearings, telemetry data, short e-mail messages (send only) and storm forecasts. Once transmitted, these reports can be combined with a computer and mapping software to show the transmitted data superimposed with great precision upon a map display.

While the map plotting is the most visible feature of APRS, the text messaging capabilities and local information distribution capabilities, combined with the robust network, should not be overlooked; the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management has an extensive network of APRS stations to allow text messaging between all of the county Emergency Operating Centers in the event of the failure of conventional communications.

==Technical information==
In its most widely used form, APRS is transported over the AX.25 protocol using 1,200-bit/s Bell 202 AFSK on frequencies located within the 2-meter amateur band.

;Sample APRS VHF frequencies
* 144.39 MHz : North America, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand
* 144.575 MHz : New Zealand
* 144.64 MHz : China, Taiwan
* 144.66 MHz : Japan
* 144.8 MHz : South Africa, Europe, Russia
* 144.93 MHz : Uruguay, Panama
* 145.175 MHz : Australia
* 145.57 MHz : Brazil
* 145.825 MHz : International Space Station and other satellites
An extensive digital repeater, or &quot;digipeater&quot; network provides transport for APRS packets on these frequencies. Internet gateway stations (IGates) connect the on-air APRS network to the APRS Internet System (APRS-IS), which serves as a worldwide, high-bandwidth backbone for APRS data. Stations can tap into this stream directly, and a number of databases connected to the APRS-IS allow Web-based access to the data as well as more advanced data-mining capabilities. A number of low-Earth orbiting satellites, including the International Space Station, are capable of relaying APRS data.

==Equipment settings==
An APRS infrastructure comprises a variety of Terminal Node Controller (TNC) equipment put in place by individual amateur radio operators. This includes sound cards interfacing a radio to a computer, simple TNCs, and &quot;smart&quot; TNCs. The &quot;smart&quot; TNCs are capable of determining what has already happened with the packet and can prevent redundant packet repeating within the network.

Reporting stations use a method of routing called a &quot;path&quot; to broadcast the information through a network. In a typical packet network, a station would use a path of known stations such as &quot;via n8xxx,n8ary.&quot; This causes the packet to be repeated through the two stations before it stops. In APRS, generic call signs are assigned to repeater stations to allow a more automatic operation.

===Recommended path===
Throughout North America (and in many other regions) the recommended path for mobiles or portable stations is now WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1. Fixed Stations (homes, etc.) should not normally use a path routing if they do not need to be digitally repeated outside of their local area, otherwise a path of WIDE2-2 or less should be used as requirements dictate. The path parameter reflects the routing of packets via the radio component of APRS, and fixed stations should carefully consider their choice of path routing. Any path selection for stations that do not require it contributes to congestion of the APRS frequency and may hinder other stations&#x27; reporting. Aircraft and balloon APRS stations should avoid beaconing with any path at altitude since digipeating may not be necessary due to their antenna height and likelihood of reaching multiple wide-ranging digipeaters and IGates. Mobile stations in congested areas or more populated areas may consider using only 1 hop (WIDE1-1), as there are usually enough Internet gateways nearby that no path routing is needed. One solution to the path selection is proportional pathing if the user&#x27;s equipment is capable.

===Old path===
Early on, the widely accepted method of configuring stations was to enable the short-range stations to repeat packets requesting a path of &quot;RELAY&quot; and long-range stations were configured to repeat both &quot;RELAY&quot; and &quot;WIDE&quot; packets. This was accomplished by setting the station&#x27;s MYALIAS setting to RELAY or WIDE as needed. This resulted in a path of RELAY,WIDE for reporting stations. However, there was no duplicate packet checking or alias substitution. This sometimes caused beacons to &quot;ping pong&quot; back and forth instead of propagating outwards from the source. This caused much interference. With no alias substitution, one could not tell which digipeaters a beacon had used.

===New path===
With the advent of the new &quot;smart&quot; TNCs, the stations that used to be &quot;WIDE&quot; became &quot;WIDEn-N.&quot; This means a packet with a path of WIDE2-2 would be repeated through the first station as WIDE2-2, but the path will be modified (decremented) to WIDE2-1 for the next station to repeat. The packet stops being repeated when the &quot;-N&quot; portion of the path reaches &quot;-0.&quot; This new protocol has caused the old RELAY and WIDE paths to become obsolete. Digi operators are being asked to re-configure fill-in &quot;RELAY&quot; stations to instead respond to WIDE1-1. This results in a new, more efficient path of WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1.

===Amateur Radio High Altitude Balloons===

Testing radio range is often a large component of these hobbies. Amateur radio is often used with packet radio to communicate at 1200 baud, using the Automatic Packet Reporting System back to the ground station. Smaller packages called micro or pico trackers are also built and run under smaller balloons. These smaller trackers have used Morse code, Field Hell, and RTTY to transmit their locations and other data.

==Related systems==
The APRS protocol has been adapted and extended to support projects not directly related to its original purpose. The most notable of these are the FireNet and PropNET projects.

* APRS FireNet is an Internet-based system using the APRS protocol and much of the same client software to provide fire fighting, earthquake, and weather information in much higher volume and detail than the traditional APRS system is capable of carrying.
* PropNET uses the APRS protocol over AX.25 and PSK31 to study radio frequency propagation. PropNET &quot;probes&quot; transmit position reports, along with information on transmitter power, elevation, and antenna gain, at various frequencies to allow monitoring stations to detect changes in propagation conditions. It is based on ACDS, a special client program running under Microsoft Windows.

<doc id="489461" wikidata="Q1143704" url="?curid=489461" title="Mariya Takeuchi">
<text>is a Japanese singer and songwriter. Regarded as an influential figure in the city pop genre, she is one of the best-selling music artists in Japan, having sold over 16 million records, and has received several accolades. Her husband is Tatsuro Yamashita, a singer-songwriter and record producer.

Takeuchi was born in Taisha, Hikawa district, now the city of Izumo, Shimane, and attended Keio University. She made her singing debut after signing with the RCA record label in 1978, with whom she released her debut album , which peaked at No. 17 on Oricon Charts. She then released four albums between 1979 and 1981, all of which obtained commercial success, including the 1980 album , which became her first work to peak at No. 1 on Oricon Charts. Takeuchi then announced she would go on a temporary hiatus in 1981, terminating her contract with RCA records. Three years later, Takeuchi and her husband Tatsuro Yamashita signed with Moon Records, and she made her comeback with her sixth studio album &quot;Variety&quot; in 1984, which was released internationally and shot her to mainstream success, and peaked at No. 1 on Oricon Charts. The track &quot;Plastic Love&quot; was released in 1985 as a single, and became a surprise hit outside of Japan in 2017, after a YouTube upload of the song went viral. The song has since attained a cult following and is seen as the staple in a revival of interest in city pop in the late 2010s.

Following the success of her ventures throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Takeuchi began releasing albums less frequently, her latest release being in 2014 as she shifted her focus to work and releasing standalone singles. Since 1981, every single she has released has charted on the Oricon Charts. She has stayed with the Moon record label, working with the different branches since signing in 1984 and since 1998 has been signed with Warner Music Japan, with whom she released the single in 2012, for which she re-recorded in 2020; the latter of which charted at No. 1 on Oricon Charts, making her the oldest Japanese singer to achieve a No. 1 single.

==Early life==

Takeuchi was born in Taisha in the Hikawa district of Shimane Prefecture in Japan. She grew up in the family &quot;Shinise Ryokan&quot; (Japanese long-established inn) business by the name of &quot;Takenoya&quot;, that her paternal great grandfather founded in 1877. Her family always played records from all over the world. She had already learned to play piano and guitar by third grade, but the Beatles left an impression that inspired her to travel.

In 1972, for her third year of high school, she studied in Rock Falls, Illinois, United States, as an international exchange student through the AFS Intercultural Programs. Her nickname was Mako, as one of the AFS yearbooks has a caption that reads Mariya &quot;Mako&quot; Takeuchi. She entered the Japanese Keio University in 1974, majoring in English literature and won a nationwide English recitation contest by &quot;The Japan Times&quot; in the spring of that year. She married fellow musician Tatsuro Yamashita in April 1982. They have one daughter.

== Career ==
Takeuchi joined the music club of her university and there she was invited to participate in &#x27;s recordings and in March 1978 so-called the omnibus album recordings. In August that year she signed up with the RCA recording label, and in November her debut single , and her debut album were released. The 1979 singles and were hits, and with that she won the 1979 Japan Record Awards, Tokyo Music Festival, Japan Music Awards, Shinjuku Music Festival, and Ginza Music Festival best new artist awards as a singer. The 1980 single was also another hit. Takeuchi has had one song (1981) that appear on the NHK program &quot;Minna no Uta&quot;.

From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, she recorded five albums and several singles. Those recordings featured dozens of prominent Japanese and North American songwriters, instrumentalists and producers, including Kazuhiko Katō, Tetsuji Hayashi, Shigeru Suzuki, Masamichi Sugi, Takashi Matsumoto, Al Capps, Peter Allen, David Lasley, Alan O&#x27;Day, David Foster, Jim Keltner, Jay Graydon, Steve Lukather, Jeff Porcaro, David Hungate, and a fellow RCA artist and her future partner and husband, Tatsuro Yamashita. One of her songs from the 1980 album , &quot;Heart to Heart&quot; (music by Roger Nichols), was given English lyrics and a new title, &quot;Now&quot;. It was recorded by the Carpenters, released in 1983, and was the last recording by Karen Carpenter before her death. At the end of 1981, after the release of her fifth album , she announced she was going to take a break for a while and paused holding concerts and new releases, and got married six months later. While taking a break she continued composing for numerous different idols and singers such as Naoko Kawai, Hiroko Yakushimaru, Yukiko Okada, Akina Nakamori, Miho Nakayama, Hiromi Iwasaki, Masahiko Kondo, among many others.

Several of these songs scored top-ten on the Oricon, such as and performed by Naoko Kawai, performed by Yukiko Okada, and performed by Miho Nakayama. Takeuchi has often re-recorded those songs for her own album. , a song originally written for the album by Akina Nakamori, became known by the composer&#x27;s recorded version, and had been covered by many artists. &quot;Genki wo Dashite&quot;, a song first recorded by Hiroko Yakushimaru, is recognized as one of Takeuchi&#x27;s notable compositions. The song was later covered by Hitomi Shimatani in 2003, and became a moderate hit.

Since her return to the Japanese music industry in 1984, she has recorded seven successful studio albums that mainly consist of her self-written songs, and all of them had reached No. 1 on the Japanese Oricon chart. As a singer-songwriter, she has produced eight top-ten hit singles on the Oricon chart, including , , , , and her only No. 1 hit . In addition to her work as a performer, she has continued writing songs and lyrics for other singers, including Ryōko Hirosue, Takako Matsu, Riho Makise, Seiko Matsuda, Masayuki Suzuki and Tackey &amp; Tsubasa.

Several of these songs scored top-ten on the Oricon, such as performed by Ryōko Hirosue, &quot;Miracle Love&quot; performed by Riho Makise, performed by Takako Matsu, and performed by Mana Ashida.Up to September 2014, Takeuchi had released 12 studio albums, 42 singles, several compilations and a live album which was recorded in 2000. Her total sales have been estimated at more than 16 million units by 2009. Her 1994 compilation, &quot;Impressions&quot;, sold more than 3 million copies in Japan alone, and became her best-selling album. In addition to her musical career, she has also managed her family&#x27;s &quot;Ryokan&quot; &quot;Takenoya&quot; since May 2018 &quot;until the next generation can take over&quot;.
Outside of Japan, she is best known for the city pop song &quot;Plastic Love&quot; from her number-one album &quot;Variety&quot; (1984). At the time of the song&#x27;s release, Takeuchi had not considered attempting to release her music in the Western world, stating in a 2018 interview, &quot;Considering that [the song] was mostly performed in Japanese, we figured it would be impossible to go abroad.&quot; The song went viral after it was uploaded to YouTube during the mid-late 2010s. Popularized overseas via the vaporwave and future funk scenes, the song has received more than 67 million views on YouTube as of June 2021. It has received critical acclaim, with &quot;Noisey&quot; calling it &quot;the best pop song in the world&quot; and Gorillaz calling it &quot;a wonder woman slab of Japanese funk&quot;. K-pop singer Yubin&#x27;s &quot;City Love&quot; is also based on this song. The Blessed Madonna closed a &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; November 2017 mix with a rendition of this song as well. Chai released a cover of the song in 2020. &quot;Plastic Love&quot; has also inspired numerous fan art and videos. On 17 May 2019, Warner Music Japan released on YouTube a short version of a music video for the song, 35 years after its initial release. A longer, five minute version was subsequently released on 11 November 2021.

In 2021, Takeuchi formed a new duo called Peach &amp; Apricot with Anri, a Japanese pop singer-songwriter. &quot;Peach&quot; refers to Takeuchi &#x27;s popular hit , while &quot;Apricot&quot; comes from Anri’s debut album title &quot;Apricot Jam&quot;. On November 3, 2021, they released their first song together, &quot;Watching Over You&quot;. The lyrics were written by Takeuchi, while the music was composed and arranged by Tetsuji Hayashi. The song marks the first collaboration between Hayashi and Takeuchi in 40 years since &quot;Ichigo no Yuuwaku&quot;, and Hayashi&#x27;s first with Anri in 38 years since &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;.

==Controversy==
, a Japanese record producer, who had mentioned Johnny Kitagawa&#x27;s sexual harassment allegations in various media, had his management contract terminated in the middle of the period by , to which he had belonged. He stated that Takeuchi and her husband Tatsuro Yamashita, who also belong to the company, agreed with the company&#x27;s policy.

<text>Mt. San Antonio College (Mt. SAC) is a public community college in Walnut, California. It offers more than 400 degree and certificate programs, 36 support programs, and more than 50 student clubs and athletic programs, including food pantry, counseling, and tutoring. The college offers associate degrees, career education, community recreation courses, ESL, adult education, and youth summer programs.

==History==
After World War II, local leaders anticipated the return of young people to college. Four local high school districts voted to approve the formation of the Mt. San Antonio Community College District in December 1945. The board wasted little time. They immediately began to meet on December 26, 1945, and set out to find a suitable location and hire staff. They leased from the state of California a former U.S. Naval hospital located on 445 acres in what was unincorporated Walnut. The land had buildings from as early as 1919, when it was a home for wayward boys. It had also been the State Narcotic Hospital before the war.

The lease began on July 1, 1946, and a newly hired staff immediately set out to open a college and begin to offer classes that fall. With a meager budget of $191,790, faculty and staff worked relentlessly to gather furniture and supplies, design courses, and register students. Family members and students voluntarily pitched in to help collect supplies and paint walls. The school opened for classes on September 16, 1946, with 682 registered students taking classes in programs organized under 7 divisions and 12 departments.

==Campus==
Sitting on 420 acres in Walnut, California, Mt. San Antonio College is strategically located in the center of the district it serves. While the college accepts students from outside of the district and even internationally, its district focuses on serving communities on the eastern edge of Los Angeles County, including Baldwin Park, Bassett, Charter Oak, Covina, Diamond Bar, the southern portion of Glendora, Hacienda Heights, City of Industry, Irwindale, La Puente, La Verne, Pomona, Rowland Heights, San Dimas, Valinda, Walnut, and West Covina.

The college has invested more than $1.5 billion in updating its facilities through public support of Measure R, Measure RR, and Measure GO bonds. The college has a 250-acre farm; a working veterinary hospital; student-run restaurant, new science classrooms and laboratory facilities; a music, dance, and theater building; multi-media/internet connected classrooms; a new Olympic-quality stadium and athletics complex, baseball complex; two soccer fields; and is home of the world-famous Mt. SAC Relays. It has an Olympic size swimming pool, tennis courts, and a working farm which includes horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and a canine facility that works with a greyhound rescue group to rehabilitate retired racing dogs each semester. The school also has a wildlife sanctuary that supports a large variety of native species of birds, mammals, and insects. It consists of a lake, swamp, stream, pond, meadow, and forested area. It is one of the last &quot;safe&quot; places for nature to exist in Walnut due to increased development and a growing population.

The Randall Planetarium has been open since 1968. There are more projects in progress, the latest being a modern agricultural sciences complex, including a working animal hospital, set to complete construction in spring 2011. Construction has also begun on a new Design Technology building. More projects are also expected in the next few years as funds from a recently voter approved measure come in. Located on campus are several campus cafes and a &quot;Common Grounds&quot; area.

==Academics==

Mt. SAC has nearly 400 programs available that provide associate degrees as well as certificates.

It has an aviation and aircraft maintenance program. Through this program, Mt SAC offers Associate of Science degrees in both Aviation Science and Commercial Flight. The school has partnerships with four-year schools to which students can arrange to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree. For example, the Mt SAC aviation program has an on-campus partnership with Southern Illinois University to offer a Bachelor of Science degree in Aviation Management. Mt. SAC is one of 36 colleges in the United States to offer the College Training Initiative (CTI) program through the FAA. This program attracts students from across the United States. It trains students to be air traffic controllers for the FAA.

Besides air traffic control, Mt. SAC has the largest Associate of Science, Commercial Flight degree program in California. It maintains a flight training association on and off campus at nearby Brackett Airport, with a hangar and facilities made possible through donations from Sophia Clarke (renowned for also providing generous gifts for the modern and stately, state-of-the-art Sophia B. Clarke theater and its adjacent equally photogenic edifices). Its flying team is ranked as the best among community colleges in the western United States from 1991 to 2006. In 2000, 2002, 2005, and 2013, the flying team ranked #1 among community colleges in the United States. Also in 2005, and in 1987, the school was the recipient of the Loening Trophy, recognizing the school as having the nation&#x27;s Best Aviation Program. The Mt SAC Flying team is a member of National Intercollegiate Flying Association and Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Flying Association.

==Student life==
Associated Students is the student government organization at Mt. San Antonio College and serves as the official voice of the student body. Its budget of more than $600,000 is generated by an optional &quot;Student Activities&quot; fee paid by students during the fall and spring semesters. Associated Students coordinates and sponsors several events for the student body. Events and sponsorships include the following: campus holiday celebration, celebrity speakers, women&#x27;s history month activities, cultural celebrations, commencement rehearsal, awards and recognition ceremonies, weekend college tours, and the transfer achievement celebration. Associated Students officers include members of the executive board, Student Senate, and Student Court.

===Public speaking===
Mt. SAC has a national award-winning Speech and Debate (forensics) team. The program has won numerous regional, national and international speech and debate tournaments, including the Phi Rho Pi national community college tournament, the American Forensics Association (AFA) national undergraduate tournament, the International Forensics Association (IFA), as well as many Readers Theater championships. Most recently, the team captured the national title at the 2024 Phi Rho Pi tournament. In 2023, the team won the Sylvia Mariner Perpetual Sweepstakes Award for earning accumulative points – an honor Mt. SAC last won 12 years beforehand in 2011. Coaches John Vitullo (2011) and Danny Cantrell (2021) were awarded the Phi Rho Pi Distinguished Service Award, which is the highest Phi Rho Pi honor awarded to a coach.

===Chamber singers===
Mt. SAC&#x27;s choral music department includes the award-winning Chamber Singers. Notable achievements include &quot;Choir of the World&quot; in 2007 at the famed Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in Wales. In addition to their world title, the mixed group also won three gold medals for their performances in the Youth Choir, Mixed Choir, and Folk Song Choir divisions, making them the choir with the most gold medals won at any of the 61 Eisteddfod competitions.

=== Fermata Nowhere ===
Mt. SAC&#x27;s TTBB a cappella group, Fermata Nowhere, is the only community college a cappella group to win an International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) title. They qualified for ICCA finals in 2004 and 2009, where they placed 2nd and 1st, respectively. In 2020, The A Cappella Archive ranked Fermata Nowhere at #15 out of all ICCA-competing ensembles. The group disbanded in 2022 with the retirement of their director William McIntosh, and a new SATB a capella group, Nu Aria, continues in its place.

== Athletics ==
The Mt. San Antonio College (Mt. SAC) athletics teams, the &quot;Mounties&quot;, have captured a total of 76 California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) state championships, with 49 titles coming since 2000. Mt.

=== Cross Country Invitational ===

Since the first event in 1948, the Mt. SAC Cross Country Invitational has grown to be the largest event of its kind in the world. It is often rich in running tradition as generations within families may have run it in the past. Mt. SAC is considered one of the most challenging cross country courses in the nation. The races all take place over the course of two weekends usually in October.

The runners start on a long (former) airstrip and run over three hills. The Valley Loop is a flat loop in the beginning of the race where runners usually overtake others. The first mile, due to the flat and hard surface is extremely quick. This mile is immediately followed by the switchbacks up the side of the first hill. These consist of four tight-knit hairpin turns. The switchbacks are very technical as the runners are often closely packed entering this area, and the hill itself is both steep and loosely packed. Arguably, the most challenging obstacle is the infamous &quot;poop out&quot; hill, which is the steepest hill on the course (as well as one of the shortest). The final climb runners must conquer before a steep descent to the flat finish area is Reservoir Hill, which is a steady uphill. The end of the race loops back to the beginning (on the airstrip), passing behind where the runners for the next race are staged. It is also designed for speed and wraps right around the spectator area for a finish at the gate entering Hilmer Lodge Stadium. The current course high school record holders are Boys 14:23, Austin Tamagno (Brea Olinda), 2014, and Girls 15:49, Claudia Lane (Malibu), 2017.

<text>Pasadena City College (PCC) is a public community college in Pasadena, California.

==History==

Pasadena City College was founded in 1924 as Pasadena Junior College. It originally operated on Pasadena High School&#x27;s campus as an extended learning program of the high school. In 1928, PJC and Pasadena High School formally merged. From 1928 to 1953, it operated as a four-year junior college, combining the last two years of high school with the first two years of college.

In 1946, John Muir College was founded due to PJC&#x27;s enlarged enrollment. The following year, Pasadena Junior College was renamed Pasadena City College. While at John Muir, Fred Phelps was profiled in &quot;Time&quot; magazine for preaching against &quot;sins committed on campus by students and teachers ... promiscuous petting ... evil language ... profanity ... cheating ... teachers&#x27; filthy jokes in classrooms ... [and] pandering to the lusts of the flesh&quot;. Phelps later became leader of the Westboro Baptist Church.

In 1954, John Muir and PCC merged, forming the modern Pasadena City College. In 1966, voters approved the creation of the Pasadena Area Junior College District. The name was subsequently changed to the Pasadena Area Community College District. Pasadena City College is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, an institutional accrediting body recognized by the Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and the U.S. Department of Education.

The Shatford Library is a direct descendant of the original Pasadena High School library that originally occupied the campus. The $16.5-million Shatford Library opened September 7, 1993, and holds 133,024 volumes in the general book collection, over 300 periodical subscriptions (plus over 2,000 titles in electronic databases) 7,338 audio cassettes, 1,019 paperbacks, 661 CDs and software, 404 volumes in the Special Services collection, and 1,186 videocassettes. Walter T. Shatford II, is the attorney for whom the library was named in recognition of his four decades of service on the school&#x27;s board and his donations. He was also active in the Civil Rights Movement.

On March 20, 2003, on the day the United States launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, many students led by the Students for Social Justice, protested on campus against the war. Protesters went through the administration building requesting students to join their cause. Three students were arrested by campus police. That same year, voters approved a bond measure for about $150 million that improved campus facilities. A significant portion of these funds were earmarked for the construction of a new building to house the college&#x27;s art and music departments. The Alumni Commons, the Aquatic Center, the Boone Sculpture Garden, and the Galloway Plaza have all replaced what were once campus parking lots. A new fourth floor parking structure (Lot 5) and a new bus parking area were completed in 2005.

In 2007, many services at the school had to relocate pending demolition of their previous facilities. These included the college bookstore, Student Affairs, Associated Students, the student business services, the campus police and the offices of the school newspaper &quot;The Courier&quot;. A groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the new Industrial and Technology building, Campus Center and Bookstore took place in October 2007. The Campus Center and Bookstore opened in August 2009. The school is one of the few community colleges with its own observatory, planetarium, and seismograph. Additionally, in 2007 demonstrators from Philadelphia-based Repent America demonstrated on campus, leading to tensions between demonstrators and some students. PCC students, some who were journalism students and staff members of the campus newspaper, &quot;PCC Courier&quot;, were involved in the May Day melee at MacArthur Park. Later that year, students and faculty held a rally in support of the Jena Six. Some students were beaten and arrested at the MacArthur Park immigrant rights demonstration on May 1, 2007.

During 2012 and 2013, the school became embroiled in conflict between students and faculty and the campus administration. On August 29, 2012, the PCC Board unilaterally cancelled the subsequent six-week winter session. One student was arrested at this board meeting. Organized by a newly formed group called Coalition of Students and Faculty for Student Achievement, a rally during the first week back of the illegitimate new Spring semester kicked off a steady wave of student and faculty activism. Eventually, course sections were cut, student transfers to four-year institutions were delayed, overall full-time student enrollments were reduced, and Proposition 30 monies allotted to the school were jeopardized. According to the California Community Colleges Chancellor&#x27;s Office, 2012–2013 had the lowest full-time enrollments in 17 years at 20,219; Spring 2013 had the lowest full-time enrollments in 10 years at 9838 students. The Faculty Association filed an unfair labor practice on the District for canceling winter abruptly and won in November 2013. The district filed an appeal to the ruling, thus prolonging the orders to rescind the trimester calendar and return to the status quo while ratcheting up annual 7% compensation to affected employees.

In Spring 2013, in an unprecedented move, the Associated Students unanimously censured the administration and passed a vote of no confidence in the school&#x27;s president, Mark W. Rocha, and collectively called for his immediate ouster. Separately, a vote among full-time faculty members expressed no confidence in Rocha by a margin of 92 percent to 8 percent. The Academic Faculty Senate also voted, 24–0, no confidence in the president.

The board of trustees remained firm in their support of Rocha, extending his contract another year and giving Rocha a raise. In 2014, however, the faculty maintained its disapproval of the college president&#x27;s performance as revealed in the faculty-wide evaluation of the PCC President. The negative campus climate has also been a concern with the staff and faculty, which prompted a campus-wide town hall sponsored by the faculty senate. Rocha was named one of &quot;Pasadena Weekly&quot;″s less-than-stellar local &quot;turkey&quot; leaders of 2013. After a failed attempt to find work elsewhere, Rocha announced his retirement on August 7, 2014, but later became the Chancellor of San Francisco City College, where after less than three years he was placed on leave in March 2020, according to the San Francisco Examiner.

In 2014, the Oscar-winning screenplay writer Dustin Lance Black was invited to speak at commencement, but in a controversial move he was subsequently uninvited by PCC Board of Trustees Anthony Fellow, who said, &quot;We just don&#x27;t want to give PCC a bad name.&quot; According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;School officials pretended that Black was never approved as commencement speaker, when in fact they approved him. They said that his brush with a sex scandal has &#x27;no place in public discussion,&#x27; when in fact they discussed it with reporters, students and each other.&quot; The college issued an apology, and later re-extended the invitation.

==Administration and governance==

The college is governed by a nine-member board of trustees. Seven members are elected (each of whom represents a geographical section of the Pasadena Area Community College District, which includes Pasadena, Altadena, La Caňada Flintridge, Sierra Madre, South Pasadena, San Marino, Arcadia, Temple City, the western portion of El Monte, the northern portion of Rosemead and the East Pasadena/East San Gabriel unincorporated area); one is a student trustee who is elected by the student body; and one is the sitting college president, who is also the district superintendent. Mark W. Rocha, former West Los Angeles College president, assumed the role of president/superintendent on July 1, 2010, when he was chosen to replace Lisa Sugimoto. His presidency was controversial with some constituents, including the faculty who twice voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in him, and he resigned in the summer of 2014.

Previous presidents/superintendents include Jack Scott (1987–1995), who served as California State Assemblymember from 1996 to 2000 and California State Senator from 2000 to 2008. , Scott is Chancellor of the California Community College system; James Kossler, 1995–2007; Paulette Perfumo, who held the position from August 2007 until her abrupt resignation in 2009; and Lisa Sugimoto, who served as acting president through the end of the 2009–2010 academic year.

== Demographics ==
The school attracts students from throughout Southern California, enrolling a large percentage of student from outside the bounds of the Pasadena Area Community College District, which was established in 1966. The district includes the cities of Pasadena, South Pasadena, Altadena, San Marino, Temple City, La Cañada Flintridge, Arcadia, Sierra Madre, and portions of Rosemead and El Monte.

, there are approximately 27,324 students enrolled in the school. Full-time enrollment 10,422 and part-time 16,902 students. The student-faculty ratio is 26-to-1. The demographics of the students in 2012: 43.2 percent Hispanic, 26.8 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 9 percent Caucasian, 3.9 percent African American, and 0.1 percent American Indian. 51.2 percent of the students are female, while 48.3 percent are male.

The in-state tuition and fees for 2017–2018 were $1,348, and out-of-state tuition and fees were $7,004. There is no application fee.

The staff members of the International Student Office assist international students in the application process and support their transition during their time at the school. Before registration, international students are required to pass the English as a Second Language (ESL) and Math placement examinations before being accepted into the school. They are also required to attend counseling to plan for classes. Assistance is available to become familiar with campus resources, i.e., Counseling Office, Library, Learning Assistance Center (LAC), the ESL Center, and Computing Services. It is recommended that all students meet with a counselor to develop a Student Educational Plan (SEP) (L104).

In 2015, there were 425 full-time professors and 1,119 part-time professors. They are represented by the Academic Senate and the Faculty Association. There were 322 classified staff. There were a total of 77 administrators (managers, directors, supervisors, deans, vice-president and president), represented by the Management Association.

== Media ==
&quot;The Courier&quot; is the official student award-winning newspaper of Pasadena City College. It has been honored with a General Excellence Award by the Journalism Association of Community Colleges. The students were also honored for their work on the campus newspaper.

==Athletics==
Athletic programs at Pasadena City College include basketball, cross country, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, baseball, softball, football, and soccer. The sports teams are known as the Lancers, and the school colors are cardinal red and gold. Pasadena&#x27;s teams were known as the Bulldogs prior the school&#x27;s merger with John Muir College in 1954. Muir&#x27;s teams were known as the &quot;Mustangs&quot;

The school&#x27;s baseball team uses the Jackie Robinson Field, located near the Rose Bowl, for practices and home games. Robinson Stadium is named for Jackie and Mack Robinson, both of whom were PCC alumni. The stadium was completed in 1999, after a renovation to move the stadium from a North-West position to an East-West direction. The stadium&#x27;s surface is SprinTurf, while the track has been converted to an all-weather surface. In addition to the school students, the stadium is used by local students from Marshall Fundamental Secondary School, Pasadena High School, and Blair International Baccalaureate School for some high school home football games due to lack of resources on the respective campus fields. It has been the home of the annual two-day &quot;Bandfest&quot; for the Pasadena Tournament of Roses for many years.

The Pasadena City College women&#x27;s badminton team won AIAW national intercollegiate championships in 1972 and 1973, topping fields that included previous champions Long Beach State and Arizona State.

==Satellite campuses ==
Pasadena City College has four satellite campuses, the Child Development Center, the Foothill campus, the Rosemead campus, and the Northwest campus at John Muir High School. 

The Child Development Center, located one block west of the PCC campus, is a childcare center for children of the school&#x27;s students. 

The Foothill campus (formally known as the Community Education Center), located two miles east of the main campus, is an offsite facility where vocational training, some ESL courses, American Citizenship courses, and the college&#x27;s high school diploma program take place. 

The Rosemead campus was established in the Fall of 2013 in efforts to provide more offerings to students throughout the district. 

The Northwest campus at John Muir High School was established in the Spring of 2016 which offers career training programs and offering high school students opportunity in applying for college courses.

Shuttles connect the main (Colorado) campus with the Foothill and Rosemead campuses (see Transportation section below).

<text>East Los Angeles College (ELAC) is a public community college in Monterey Park, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. It is part of the California Community Colleges System and the Los Angeles Community College District. With fourteen communities comprising its primary service area and an enrollment of 35,403 students, ELAC had the largest student body campus by enrollment in the state of California as of 2018. It was situated in northeastern East Los Angeles before that part of unincorporated East Los Angeles was annexed by Monterey Park in the early 1970s. ELAC offers associate degrees and certificates.

==History==
At the end of World War II, Los Angeles faced the need for another city college to accommodate the vast numbers of servicemen returning from deployment. Los Angeles City College (LACC) was the first city college serving Los Angeles, and by the war&#x27;s end, it remained the only one in the area. Limited and costly transportation hindered the number of students who could attend LACC. Meanwhile, the Eastside was rapidly evolving into the city&#x27;s industrial hub.

Arthur Baum, the editor of the East Los Angeles Tribune, led a citizens&#x27; committee, composed of presidents of various clubs and organizations in the community. The committee included Principal D. Raymond Brothers of Garfield High School, County Supervisor Smith, Superintendent Kersey, and several industrial leaders. They presented the proposition of establishing a junior college to the Los Angeles City Board of Education in a special meeting on March 1, 1945. The Los Angeles Board of Education voted in favor, leading to the establishment of a Junior College on the Garfield High School campus in June 1945. This marked the creation of East Los Angeles College, only the second city college (or junior college) serving the Los Angeles area.

The college commenced classes on September 4, 1945, operating on the Garfield High School campus with an initial enrollment of 373 students and 19 faculty members, even though the school board had authorized a faculty of 25, drawn from the LACC staff. Of these, 107 students attended college classes at Garfield, while 266 pursued health careers at L.A. County Hospital, primarily in nursing. The junior college was part of the Los Angeles City Public Schools system (now part of the L.A. Unified School District).&quot;

On September 19, 1945, the first edition of the Campus News (a temporary newspaper) for the college was published. On September 25, a constitution for the Junior College was adopted and presented during an assembly. The college had to cope with the significant number of returning servicemen (veterans) enrolling, thanks to the G.I. Bill, as approximately 50,000 men were being discharged in the state each month.

The college relocated to its current site on Avenida Cesar Chavez in February 1948. It is situated six miles from the Los Angeles Civic Center. A portion of the 2005 movie Goal! was filmed at the ELAC Weingart Stadium. The ELAC men&#x27;s basketball team is prominently featured in the Netflix series &quot;Last Chance U: Basketball,&quot; a spin-off of the original &quot;Last Chance U,&quot; which premiered on March 10, 2021.

East Los Angeles College will offer the state&#x27;s first community college program in Central American studies.

===College presidents===
===South Gate Campus===
The East Los Angeles College (ELAC) South Gate Campus is an extension of East Los Angeles College, created to expand its academic services to the southeast corridor of Los Angeles. Construction of the new South Gate campus began in 2019 on the former site of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., with an expected opening in fall 2022. On March 22, 2021, the California Community Colleges Board of Governors officially approved the South Gate Campus as an &#x27;education center.

===Performing Arts and Theatrical Expression===
ELAC is home to the Vincent Price Art Museum, a contemporary art museum named in honor of the American actor and art collector, Vincent Price. In 1957, inspired by the students&#x27; spirit and the community&#x27;s need to experience original artworks firsthand, Vincent and Mary Grant Price donated 90 pieces from their private collection to establish the museum. It was the first &#x27;teaching art collection&#x27; owned by a community college in the United States. Over their lifetimes, the Price family ultimately donated 2,000 pieces, and the museum&#x27;s permanent collection now boasts over 9,000 pieces valued at over $5 million.

In 1974, Roberto Esteban Chavez painted &quot;The Path to Knowledge and the False University,&quot; a 200-foot mural on the East Los Angeles Community College campus, where he served as an arts educator and chair of the Chicano Studies department. Although the college destroyed the mural, its impact and the political questions surrounding its destruction were documented in two museum exhibits: &#x27;Roberto Chavez and The False University: A Retrospective&#x27; at the Vincent Price Museum and &quot;Murales Rebeldes: L.A. Chicana/o Murals under Siege&quot; as part of the Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA Beyond Borders initiative in 2017.

==Student life==
The school follows a semester-based academic year. The student-faculty ratio is 34-to-1. For the 2017–2018 academic year, in-state tuition and fees were $1,220, while out-of-state tuition and fees were $7,746. There is no application fee. As of fall 2018, the total enrollment at ELAC was 35,403, with 7,810 full-time students and 27,593 part-time students. The total number of entering students for fall 2017 was 34,697, with 8,538 full-time students and 26,569 part-time students.

The popular programs include: Social Sciences, Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and Related Protective Services, and Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services.

===Honors Program===
The East Los Angeles Honors Program, recognized by the UC system, the Claremont Colleges, Occidental College, and Loyola Marymount, offers rigorous courses designed to help students transfer and successfully transition to four-year universities. The Honors Program is open to both part-time and full-time students and requires a 3.0 GPA to apply and be considered for enrollment. Successful completion of the Honors Program guarantees priority consideration for admission at 11 four-year universities throughout California and Washington.

===Rankings===
In 2016, the school was ranked 13th for the Best 2-Year College for adult learners in &#x27;America&#x27;s Best Colleges for Adult Learners&#x27; by Washington Monthly. In 2019, it achieved the top ranking in California and the 6th position nationwide for awarding degrees and certificates to Hispanic students, as reported by Hispanic Outlook on Education Magazine.

==Engagement with local high schools==
ELAC&#x27;s Weingart Stadium, located on its football field, serves as the venue for graduation ceremonies of local high schools, including Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. The stadium also hosts the annual &quot;East L.A. Classic&quot; football game, featuring a matchup between Garfield and Theodore Roosevelt High School. This event traditionally draws over 20,000 fans, with notable figures like U.S. Senate candidate Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez even in attendance at the 2016 game.

Billy McMillin, a first-time director, won the 2017 storytelling award at the LA Film Festival for his documentary film &quot;The Classic&quot; about the football game.

<doc id="489468" wikidata="Q1333734" url="?curid=489468" title="Marv Wolfman">
<text>Marvin Arthur Wolfman (born May 13, 1946) is an American comic book and novelization writer. He worked on Marvel Comics&#x27;s &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, for which he and artist Gene Colan created the vampire-slayer Blade, and DC Comics&#x27;s &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; and the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; limited series with George Pérez.

Among the many characters Wolfman created or co-created are Cyborg, Raven, Starfire, Deathstroke, Tim Drake, Rose Wilson, Nova, Black Cat, Phobia, Bullseye, Vigilante (Adrian Chase), the Omega Men, and the Nightwing identity of Dick Grayson.

==Early life==
Marv Wolfman was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of police officer Abe and housewife Fay. He has a sister, Harriet, 12 years older. When Wolfman was 13, his family moved to Flushing, Queens, in New York City, where he attended junior high school. He went on to New York&#x27;s High School of Art and Design, in Manhattan, hoping to become a cartoonist. Wolfman is Jewish.

==Career==

===1960s===

Marvin Wolfman was active in fandom before he began his professional comics career at DC Comics in 1968. Wolfman was one of the first to publish Stephen King, with &quot;In A Half-World of Terror&quot; in Wolfman&#x27;s horror fanzine &quot;Stories of Suspense&quot; No. 2 (1965). This was a revised version of King&#x27;s first published story, &quot;I Was a Teenage Grave Robber&quot;, which had been serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of the fanzine &quot;Comics Review&quot; that same year.

Wolfman&#x27;s first published work for DC Comics appeared in &quot;Blackhawk&quot; No. 242 (Aug.–Sept. 1968). He and longtime friend Len Wein created the character Jonny Double in &quot;Showcase&quot; No. 78 (November 1968) plotted by Wolfman and scripted by Joe Gill. The two co-wrote &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; No. 18 (Dec. 1968), which would be Wein&#x27;s first professional comics credit. Neal Adams was called upon to rewrite and redraw a &quot;Teen Titans&quot; story which had been written by Wein and Wolfman. The story, titled &quot;Titans Fit the Battle of Jericho!&quot;, would have introduced DC&#x27;s first African American superhero, but was rejected by publisher Carmine Infantino. The revised story appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; No. 20 (March–April 1969). Wolfman and Gil Kane created an origin for Wonder Girl in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; No. 22 (July–Aug. 1969) which introduced the character&#x27;s new costume.

===1970s===
He and artist Bernie Wrightson co-created Destiny in &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; No. 1 (July–Aug. 1972), a character which would later be used in the work of Neil Gaiman.

In 1972, Wolfman moved to Marvel Comics as a protégé of then-editor Roy Thomas. When Thomas stepped down, Wolfman eventually took over as editor, initially in charge of the publisher&#x27;s black-and-white magazines, then finally the color line of comics. Wolfman said in 1981 that, &quot;Marvel never gave [its] full commitment to&quot; the black-and-white line. &quot;No one wanted to commit themselves to the staff.&quot; He added, &quot;We used to farm the books out to Harry Chester Studios [sic] and whatever they pasted up, they pasted up. I formed the first production staff, hired the first layout people, paste-up people.&quot; Wolfman stepped down as editor-in-chief to spend more time writing.

He and artist Gene Colan crafted &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, a horror comic that became &quot;one of the most acclaimed horror-themed comic books ever&quot;. During their run on this series, they created Blade, a character who would later be portrayed by actor Wesley Snipes in a film trilogy. In addition, the editorship of Marvel could not resist the opportunity to assign a writer with such a surname to contribute a few stories to their concurrent monster title, &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot;, with a playful editor&#x27;s comment: &quot;At last -- WEREWOLF -- written by a WOLFMAN.&quot;

Wolfman co-created Bullseye in &quot;Daredevil&quot; No. 131 (March 1976). He and artist John Buscema created Nova in that character&#x27;s eponymous first issue.
Wolfman and Gil Kane adapted Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Barsoom&quot; concepts into comics in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;John Carter, Warlord of Mars&quot; series. Wolfman wrote 14 issues of &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; starting with issue No. 25 (March 1977). The &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; series was launched in April 1978 by Wolfman and artist Carmine Infantino. As the first regular writer on &quot;Spider-Woman&quot;, he redesigned the character, giving her a human identity as Jessica Drew. Wolfman succeeded Len Wein as writer of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and in his first issue, No. 182 (July 1978), had Peter Parker propose marriage to Mary Jane Watson who refused, in the following issue. Wolfman and Keith Pollard introduced the Black Cat (Felicia Hardy) in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 194 (July 1979).

In 1978, Wolfman and artist Alan Kupperberg took over the Howard the Duck syndicated newspaper comic strip. While writing the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (which Wolfman stated to be his favorite comic), Wolfman and John Byrne introduced a new herald for Galactus named Terrax in No. 211 (Oct. 1979). A Godzilla story by Wolfman and Steve Ditko was changed into a Dragon Lord story published in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; vol. 2 No. 5 (March 1980). The creature that the Dragon Lord battled was intended to be Godzilla, but since Marvel no longer had the rights to the character, the creature was modified to a dragon called The Wani.

===1980s===

====&quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;====
In 1980, Wolfman returned to DC after a dispute with Marvel. Teaming with penciller George Pérez, Wolfman relaunched DC&#x27;s Teen Titans in a special preview in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; No. 26 (October 1980). &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; added the Wolfman-Pérez creations Raven, Starfire, and Cyborg to the old team&#x27;s Robin, Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, and Beast Boy (renamed Changeling). The series became DC&#x27;s first new hit in years; Christopher J. Priest called Deathstroke, another new character, &quot;the first modern supervillain&quot;. Wolfman wrote a series of &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; drug awareness comic books which were published in cooperation with The President&#x27;s Drug Awareness Campaign in 1983–1984. The first was pencilled by Pérez and sponsored by the Keebler Company, the second was illustrated by Ross Andru and underwritten by the American Soft Drink Industry, and the third was drawn by Adrian Gonzales and financed by IBM. In August 1984, Wolfman and Pérez launched a second &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; series.

Other projects by Wolfman for DC during the early 1980s included collaborating with artist Gil Kane on a run on the Superman feature in &quot;Action Comics&quot;; a revival of &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot; with Carmine Infantino; launching &quot;Night Force&quot;, a supernatural series drawn by Gene Colan; and a nearly two-year run on &quot;Green Lantern&quot; with Joe Staton. During their collaboration on that series, Wolfman and Staton created the Omega Men in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; No. 141 (June 1981). Wolfman briefly wrote &quot;Batman&quot; and co-created the Electrocutioner in issue No. 331 (Jan. 1981). Wolfman was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series in 1986.

After Pérez left &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; in 1985, Wolfman continued for many years with other collaborators – including pencillers José Luis García-López, Eduardo Barreto and Tom Grummett. In December 1986, Wolfman was informed by Marvel writer Chris Claremont that a DC executive had approached Claremont at a holiday party and offered him the position of writer on &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;. Claremont immediately declined the offer and told Wolfman that apparently the publisher was looking to replace him on the title. When Wolfman confronted DC executives about this, he was told it was &quot;just a joke&quot;, although Claremont reiterated that he took it to be a credible and official offer.

====&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;====
In 1985, Wolfman and Pérez launched &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, a 12-issue limited series celebrating DC&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Featuring a cast of thousands and a timeline that ranged from the beginning of the universe to the end of time, it killed scores of characters, integrated a number of heroes from other companies to DC continuity, and re-wrote 50 years of DC universe history to streamline it. After finishing &quot;Crisis&quot;, Wolfman and Pérez produced the &quot;History of the DC Universe&quot; limited series to summarize the company&#x27;s new history.

Wolfman was involved in the relaunch of the Superman line as well, reinventing nemesis Lex Luthor and initially scripting the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; title with Jerry Ordway as the artist. During this period they introduced Bibbo Bibbowski and Professor Emil Hamilton.

====Ratings dispute====
Wolfman got into a public dispute with DC over a proposed ratings system, which led to his being relieved of his editorial duties by the company. DC offered to reinstate Wolfman as an editor provided he apologize for making his criticism of the ratings system public, rather than keeping them internal to the company, but he declined to do so.

===1990s===
Wolfman returned to the Dark Knight for another brief run on &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, writing &quot;Batman: Year Three&quot;, creating Robin III Tim Drake as well as Abattoir and a new version of the Electrocutioner, and writing an anniversary adaptation of the first ever Batman story, which was printed along with two other adaptations and the original. He continued as &quot;The New Titans&quot; writer and revitalized the series with artist Tom Grummett. Wolfman wrote the series until the title&#x27;s last issue. Wolfman&#x27;s writing for comics decreased as he turned to animation and television, though he wrote the mid-1990s DC series &quot;The Man Called A-X&quot;.

====Disney career====
In the early-1990s, Wolfman worked at Disney Comics. He wrote scripts for a seven part &quot;DuckTales&quot; story (&quot;Scrooge&#x27;s Quest&quot;), as well as several others – with the characters from the Mickey Mouse universe – that appeared in &quot;Mickey Mouse Adventures&quot;. He was editor of the comics section on the &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; magazine for the early years of the publication.

====Marvel lawsuit====
In 1997, on the eve of the impending release of the &quot;Blade&quot; motion picture, Wolfman sued Marvel Characters Inc. over ownership of all characters he had created for Marvel Comics. A ruling in Marvel&#x27;s favor was handed down on November 6, 2000. Wolfman&#x27;s stance was that he had not signed work-for-hire contracts when he created characters including Blade and Nova. In a nonjury trial, the judge ruled that Marvel&#x27;s later use of the characters was sufficiently different to protect it from Wolfman&#x27;s claim of copyright ownership.

====&quot;Beast Machines&quot;====
In the late 1990s, Wolfman developed the Transformers TV series &quot;Beast Machines&quot;, which aired on Fox Kids for two seasons from 1999 to 2000. The program was a direct continuation of the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; series, which itself was a continuation of the original Transformers show. &quot;Beast Machines&quot; was met with mixed reviews, as the show was praised for its story, but was criticized for its focus on spirituality. Previously, in the 1980s, Wolfman wrote the story for Optimus Prime&#x27;s return in &quot;The Return of Optimus Prime&quot; of the third season of &quot;Transformers&quot;.

===2000s===

A decade later, Wolfman began writing in comics again, scripting &quot;Defex&quot;, the flagship title of Devil&#x27;s Due Productions&#x27; Aftermath line. He wrote an &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; issue of DC&#x27;s &quot;Secret Files&quot;, and consulted with writer Geoff Johns on several issues of &quot;The Teen Titans&quot;. Wolfman wrote a novel based on &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, but rather than following the original plot, he created a new story starring the Barry Allen Flash that takes place during the original Crisis story. Wolfman wrote the novelization of the film &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, and worked on a direct-to-video animated film, &quot;The Condor&quot;, for Stan Lee&#x27;s Pow Entertainment.

In 2006, Wolfman was editorial director of Impact Comics (no relation to the DC Comics imprint), publisher of educational manga-style comics for high school students. That same year, starting with issue No. 125, Wolfman began writing DC&#x27;s &quot;Nightwing&quot; series. Initially scheduled for a four-issue run, Wolfman&#x27;s run was expanded to 13 issues, and finished with No. 137. During the course of his run, Wolfman introduced a new Vigilante character. Following Wolfman&#x27;s departure from the pages of &quot;Nightwing&quot;, the Vigilante was spun off into his own short-lived title, which Wolfman wrote. He wrote a miniseries starring the Teen Titan Raven, a character he and George Pérez co-created during their run on &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, helping to revamp and update the character. He worked with Pérez on a direct-to-DVD movie adaptation of the popular &quot;Judas Contract&quot; storyline from their tenure on &quot;Teen Titans&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2011, he and Pérez completed the &quot;New Teen Titans: Games&quot; graphic novel, which they had begun working on in the late 1980s. Wolfman revived his &quot;Night Force&quot; series with artist Tom Mandrake in 2012. He served as writing consultant on the video game &quot;Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two&quot;, which he was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing. In 2015, Wolfman wrote a novelization of the videogame &quot;&quot;.
And in 2016 he published the novelization of the Suicide Squad film through Titan Books. He received the Hero Initiative Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017. That year also marked Wolfman&#x27;s first work for Marvel since 1998: a backup story for &quot;Bullseye&quot; #1, starring the titular character that he had co-created in 1976. In 2019, he wrote the main story for the &quot;DC Primal Age 100-Page Giant&quot;. Also in 2019, DC published the oversized, 100-page comic book &quot;Man and Superman&quot;, Marv Wolfman&#x27;s retelling of Superman&#x27;s origin story, to high acclaim.

=== 2020s ===
On the occasion of the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; Arrowverse crossover, Marv Wolfman co-wrote an episode of The CW series &quot;Arrow&quot; with Marc Guggenheim that aired in January 2020. He also made a cameo appearance in the crossover finale in an episode of &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. In 2021, he and George Perez voiced cartoon versions of themselves on two episodes of &quot;Teen Titans GO!&quot;.

In 2023, Wolfman returned to Marvel Comics for the oneshot &quot;What If…? Dark: Tomb of Dracula&quot; featuring his character Blade. In April 2024, Wolfman wrote the final two pages of the landmark 300th issue of &quot;Nightwing&quot;.

==Writing credit pioneer==
Wolfman, on the panel &quot;Marvel Comics: The Method and the Madness&quot; at the 1974 New York City Comic Art Convention, told the audience that when he first began working for DC Comics, he received DC&#x27;s first writing credit on its mystery magazines. Gerry Conway, who wrote the horror-host interstitial pages between stories, wrote in one issue, &quot;House of Secrets&quot; Vol. 1 Issue 83, that the following story, &quot;The Stuff that Dreams are Made of&quot; was told to him by a &quot;wandering Wolfman.&quot; The Comics Code Authority, which did not permit the mention of werewolves or wolfmen at that time, demanded it be removed. DC informed the Authority that &quot;Wolfman&quot; was the writer&#x27;s last name, so the Authority insisted he be given a credit to show the &quot;Wolfman&quot; was a real person. Once Wolfman was given a credit, other writers demanded them as well. Shortly, credits were given to all writers and artists.

==Personal life==
Wolfman is married to Noel Watkins. Wolfman was previously married to Michele Wolfman, for many years a colorist in the comics industry. They have a daughter, Jessica Morgan.

<text>Citrus College is a public community college in Glendora, California. The Citrus Community College District, which supports the institution, includes the communities of Azusa, Claremont, Duarte, Glendora, and Monrovia. 

Citrus Union High School was founded in 1891 to serve Azusa and Glendora. In 1915, educator Floyd S. Hayden expanded its offerings to include a junior college, and, from 1915 to 1961, the school was operated by the Citrus Union High School District as both a high school and a junior college. Citrus College is the oldest community college in Los Angeles County, California, and the fifth oldest in the state of California.

During the 2019-2020 academic year, Citrus College enrolled 19,626 students. It conferred 2,444 degrees and awarded 2,175 certificates. Citrus College offers 65 associate degree programs, 88 certificate programs, and skill awards in career technical education programs. Its operating budget for 2020-2021 was $78 million.

== Campus ==

Citrus College has a 104-acre (42 ha) campus, which includes 44 buildings and seven outdoor athletics facilities.

The Haugh Performing Arts Center (HPAC) is a 1,440-seat proscenium venue and is host to over 140 performances annually, with over 100,000 patrons in attendance. Seats are no more than from the stage.

The campus also holds a larger herbarium.

The campus is also served by a nearby rail station for the Metro A Line as of March 5, 2016.

== Athletics ==
The college&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Owls. The college currently fields eight men&#x27;s and eight women&#x27;s varsity teams. It competes as a member of the California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) in the Western State Conference (WSC) for all sports except football, which competes in Southern California Football Association (SCFA). The football and soccer team play at the 10,000-seat-capacity Citrus Stadium.

== Academics ==
The college runs the Citrus Singers program. The program started in the 1960s and has provided a foundation for students to learn and perform music. Many of its alumni have gone on to be performers on Broadway and Television.

== Accreditation ==
The college has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Its professional memberships include the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) and the Community College League of California (CCLC).

== Notable faculty ==
* John Boylan, Professor of Critical Listening Skills, and Music Business/Audio Careers
* Dale Salwak, Professor of English. Author of numerous books, including &quot;Teaching Life&quot;, a memoir of over 35 years of teaching.

== Notable alumni ==
* Carlos Fisher, professional baseball player
*Billy Kilmer, professional football player
* Chris Limahelu, college football player
* Lionel Manuel, professional football player

== Free speech lawsuits==
In 2003, at California&#x27;s Citrus College, under the pressure of litigation and FIRE&#x27;s national campaign for campus constitutional rights, the Board of Trustees voted to rescind most of the speech codes at the public institution. This was the first victory in FIRE&#x27;s declared war on speech codes at public colleges and universities.

The following year, Citrus College was sued again by FIRE when Citrus College reinstated its policy in the early 2010s, when a Young Americans for Liberty chapter, led by Gabriel Nadales and Vincenzo Sinapi-Riddle, was threatened with sanctions for not staying inside the &quot;Free Speech Zone.&quot; In an interview to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, Greg Lukianoff, the president of Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, said, &quot;&#x27;Citrus College agreed to eliminate its restrictive &#x27;free speech zone&#x27; in the face of a FIRE lawsuit back in 2003, but later reinstated its speech quarantine when it thought no one was watching&#x27;...&#x27;But FIRE was watching, and we&#x27;ll continue to do so. If the speech codes come back again, so will we.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="489471" wikidata="Q2610567" url="?curid=489471" title="La Faute de l'Abbé Mouret">
<text> (1875) is the fifth novel in Émile Zola&#x27;s twenty-volume series &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot;. Viciously anticlerical in tone, it follows on from the horrific events at the end of , focussing this time on a remote Provençal backwater village.

Unusually for Zola, the novel contains very few characters and locations, and its use of amnesia as a plot device gives it an unusually fantastical tone.

==Plot summary==
The plot centres on the neurotic young priest Serge Mouret, first seen in , as he takes his orders and becomes the parish priest for the uninterested village of Artauds. The inbred villagers have no interest in religion and Serge is portrayed giving several wildly enthusiastic Masses to his completely empty, near-derelict church. Serge not only seems unperturbed by this state of affairs but actually appears to have positively sought it out especially, for it gives him time to contemplate religious affairs and to fully experience the fervour of his faith. Eventually he has a complete nervous breakdown and collapses into a near-comatose state, whereupon his distant relative, the unconventional doctor Pascal Rougon (the central character of the last novel in the series, 1893&#x27;s ), places him in the care of the inhabitants of a nearby derelict stately home, Le Paradou.

The novel then takes a complete new direction in terms of both tone and style, as Serge — suffering from amnesia and total long-term memory loss, with no idea who or where he is beyond his first name — is doted upon by Albine, the whimsical, innocent and entirely uneducated girl who has been left to grow up practically alone and wild in the vast, sprawling, overgrown grounds of Le Paradou. The two of them live a life of idyllic bliss with many biblical parallels and over, the course of a number of months, they fall deeply in love with one another; however, at the moment they consummate their relationship, they are discovered by Serge&#x27;s monstrous former monsignor and his memory is instantly returned to him. Wracked with guilt at his unwitting sins, Serge is plunged into a deeper religious fervour than ever before, and Albine is left bewildered at the loss of her lover. As with many of Zola&#x27;s earlier works, the novel then builds to a tragic climax where Albine takes her own life by poisoning herself with flower fumes.

The novel was translated into English by Vizetelly &amp; Co. in the 1880s as &quot;Abbé Mouret&#x27;s Transgression&quot;, but this text must be considered faulty due to its many omissions and bowdlerisations, as well as its rendering of Zola&#x27;s language in one of his most technically complex novels into a prolix and flat style of Victorian English bearing little resemblance to the original text. Two more faithful translations emerged in the 1950s and 1960s under the titles &quot;The Sinful Priest&quot; and &quot;The Sin of Father Mouret&quot;.

:* &quot;Abbé Mouret&#x27;s Transgression&quot; (1886, tr. unknown for H. Vizetelly, Vizetelly &amp; Co.)
:* &quot;Abbé Mouret&#x27;s Transgression&quot; (1900, tr. unknown edited by E. A. Vizetelly, Chatto &amp; Windus)
:* &quot;The Sin of the Abbé Mouret&quot; (1904, tr. M. Smyth, McLaren &amp; Co.)
:* &quot;The Abbé Mouret&#x27;s Sin&quot; (1957, tr. Alec Brown, Elek Books, republished as &quot;The Sinful Priest&quot; in 1960)
:* &quot;The Sin of Father Mouret&quot; (1969, tr. Sandy Petrey, Prentice-Hall)
:* &quot;The Sin of Father Mouret&quot; (2017, tr. Valerie Minogue, Oxford University Press)

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted as the 1970 French film &quot;The Demise of Father Mouret&quot;, directed by Georges Franju, starring Gillian Hills and Francis Huster. The Austrian composer Gerhard Wimberger has based his opera &quot;Paradou&quot; (1981/1985) on this novel.

==Influence==

The novel inspired a now lost painting by John Collier (1850—1934), exhibited in 1895 at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, under the title &quot;The death of Albine&quot;. The painting was reproduced in the weekly &quot;The Graphic&quot; on 31 August 1895 (example in the British Museum, London).
It also inspired Joseph Edouard Dantan for his painting &quot;Le Paradou&quot; (1883; Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent).

<doc id="489473" wikidata="Q13283" url="?curid=489473" title="Soqotri language">
<text>Soqotri (; ; ) is a South Semitic language spoken by the Soqotri people on the island of Socotra and the two nearby islands of Abd al Kuri and Samhah, in the Socotra archipelago, in the Guardafui Channel. Soqotri is one of six languages that form a group called Modern South Arabian languages (MSAL). These additional languages include Mehri, Shehri, Bathari, Harsusi and Hobyot. All are spoken in different regions of Southern Arabia.

== Classification ==
Soqotri is often mistaken as a variety of Arabic but is officially classified as an Afro-Asiatic, Semitic, South Semitic and South Arabian language.

== Status ==
=== Endangerment ===
The language is under immense influence of the dominant Arabic language and culture because many Arabic-speaking Yemenis have settled in the Soqotri region permanently, resulting in Arabic becoming the official language of the island. Soqotri is now replaced with Arabic as a means of education in schools. Students are prohibited from using their mother tongue while at school and job seeking Soqotrans must be able to speak Arabic before getting employed. Young Soqotrans even prefer Arabic to Soqotri and now have a difficult time learning it. Oftentimes they mix Arabic in it and cannot recite or understand any piece of Soqotri oral literature.

Arabic is now the symbolic, or more ideological, articulation of the nation&#x27;s identity, making it the privileged lingua franca of the nation. The government has also taken up an inclination of neglect toward the Soqotri language. This seems to based on the view that Soqotri is only a dialect rather than a language itself. There is also no cultural policy on what should be done about the remaining oral non-Arabic languages of Yemen, include Soqotri and Mehri. The language is seen as an impediment to progress because of the new generation&#x27;s judgement of it as being irrelevant in helping to improve the socio-economic status of the island. Limitations to Soqotri, such as not being able to communicate through writing, are also viewed as obstacles by the youth that makes up 60% of the population. There seems to be cultural sentiments toward the language but yet an indifference due to neglect and the notion of hindrance associated with it.

Hence, Soqotri is regarded as a severely endangered language and a main concern toward the lack of research in Soqotri language field is not only related to the semitics, but to the Soqotri folklore heritage conservation. This isolated island has high pressures of modernization and with a rapidly changing cultural environment, there is a possibility of losing valuable strata of the Soqotran folklore heritage.

Poetry and song used to be a normal part of everyday life for people on the island, a way of communicating with others, no matter if they were human, animal, spirits of the dead, jinn sorcerers, or the divine. However, Soqotri poetry has been overlooked and the skill of the island&#x27;s poets ignored.

The European Union has also expressed serious concerns on the issue of preserving cultural precepts of the archipelago&#x27;s population.

== Geographic distribution ==
The total population of Soqotri users throughout Yemen is 57,000 (1990 census) and total users in all countries is 71,400.

=== Official status ===
Soqotri has no official status. It is a language of Yemen where it is spoken mainly on the islands of the Socotra Governorate: &#x27;Abd al Kuri, Darsah, Samha, and Soqotra islands in the Gulf of Aden.

=== Dialects/Varieties ===
The Soqotri dialectology is very rich, especially considering the surface of the island and number of inhabitants. Soqotri speakers live on their islands, but rarely on the Yemeni mainland. The language was, through its history, isolated from the Arabian mainland. Arabic is also spoken in a dialectal form on Socotra.

There are four dialect groups: the dialects spoken on the north coast, the dialects spoken on the south coast, the dialects spoken by Bedouins in the mountains in the centre of the island and the dialect spoken on Abd al Kuri. The dialect that is spoken on this island Samhah appears to be the same as the one spoken on the west coast of Socotra.

These dialects include Abd Al-Kuri, Southern Soqotri, Northern Soqotri, Central Soqotri, and Western Soqotri.

Scholars believe there are no longer any grounds for associating the Modern South Arabian languages so directly with Arabic. They consider these dialects to be not Arabic, but Semitic languages in their own right.

== Phonology ==


The isolation of the island of Socotra has led to the Soqotri language independently developing certain phonetic characteristics absent in even the closely related languages of the mainland. Soqotri lost interdentals &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;ð&quot;, and &quot;θʼ&quot; and merged them with &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;tˤ&quot;: e.g. Soqotri has &quot;dor&quot; &quot;blood&quot; where Shehri has &quot;ðɔhr&quot; and Mehri has &quot;ðōrə&quot;; Soqotri has &quot;tˤarb&quot; (a piece of wood), where Shehri and Mehri have &quot;θʼarb&quot;; Soqotri &quot;tri/trɔ&quot; (two) where Shehri has &quot;θroh&quot; and Mehri has &quot;θərō&quot;.

Soqotri emphatics (except /lˠ/) used to be ejective consonants. However, ejectives have largely become pharyngealized consonants as in Arabic, with the exception of /kʼ/.

== Grammar ==
Soqotri grammar and vocabulary is very poorly documented and distributed. There have been many proposals on the collection of linguistic data. This will allow a deeper understanding of the Soqotran scientific, literary, spiritual, and so on, culture native speakers. Preservation of the Soqotri language will give future generations access to this education as well.

=== Morphology ===

==== Independent pronouns ====
Independent personal pronouns for the 2nd person singular, ē (m.) and ī (f.), are more widespread than &quot;het&quot; and &quot;hit.&quot; In research done by Marie-Claude Simeone-Senelle, &quot;het&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; actually specific to some of the dialects spoken in Diksam, and the far-western areas of Qalansiya, Qafiz. She found that in other places, the 2nd singular m. and f., are ē and ī. In the latest system, the subject pronouns are the full form.

==== Connective particle ====
Another linguistic uniqueness in the far-western dialect of Qafiz is the possessive construction. This dialect, like all other Soqotri dialects, is based in the connective &quot;d-&quot;, followed by a pronoun. However, in this dialect, the connective is variable (like the relative pronoun): &quot;d-&quot; with a singular, and &quot;l-&quot; with a plural:

dihet férham/ girl&gt;&#x27;your (msg.) girl&#x27;, &quot;des&quot; &#x27;her&#x27;..., but &quot;lḥan&quot;, &#x27;our&#x27;, &quot;ltan&quot; &#x27;your (pl.)&#x27;, &quot;lyihan&quot; &#x27;their (m.)&#x27;, &quot;lisan&quot; &#x27;their (f.)&#x27;.

This variation highlights the link between connective, deictic and relative pronoun. In other dialects, a grammaticalization process took place and the singular form was frozen as a connecting invariable particle &quot;d-&quot;.

=== Syntax ===

==== Agreement ====
In some dialects, the relative pronoun does not agree with plural:

In remote places, old people use the verbal, nominal and pronominal dual:

but many native speakers (young people or people in contact with Arabic) do not use verbal dual regularly:

and they use plural pronouns instead of the dual form:

&quot;tten férhem&quot; &lt;of-your (pl.)/girl&gt;&#x27;your girl&#x27; for /tti férhem/ &#x27;your girl&#x27; (to you both).

Many people in contact with Arabic tend to use plural in all cases (verb or pronoun). Only the nominal dual occurs regularly.

==== Negation ====
&quot;Cf.&quot; above, about the phono-morphological explanation for the two forms of negation. In many dialects, the verbal negation is the same with indicative and prohibitive.

== Vocabulary ==
Lieutenant Wellstedt, who was part of a surveying mission in 1835, was the first to collect toponyms, tribe names, plant names, figures, and in total was able to put together a list of 236 Soqotri words. The words have no characteristics of the Western dialects and 41 words out of the 236 were noted as Arabic loans by Wellstedt. Some are really Arabic as &quot;beïdh&quot; (&quot;bayḍ&quot;) &#x27;eggs&#x27; (ḳ&quot;ehélihen&quot; in Soqotri) or &quot;ˤajúz&quot; &#x27;old woman&#x27; (Soqotri ś&quot;íbīb&quot;), &quot;thob&quot; (t&quot;ob&quot;) &#x27;a shirt&#x27; (with interdental, absent from the Soqotri consonant system; &quot;tob&quot; in Soqotri means &#x27;cloth&#x27;); many words belong to the old common Semitic vocabulary and are attested in both Arabic and Soqotri: &#x27;ears&#x27; (exactly &quot;ˤídəhen&quot;), &quot;ˤaṣábi&quot; &#x27;fingers&#x27; (&quot;ˤəṣābe&quot;) etc. Religious poems show influence of Arabic with borrowings from classical Arabic vocabulary and Quranic expressions.

== Writing system ==
A writing system for the Soqotri language was developed in 2014 by a Russian team led by Dr. Vitaly Naumkin following five years of work. This writing system can be read in his book Corpus of Soqotri Oral Literature. The script is Arabic-based and transcriptions of the text appear in translated English and Arabic. This Arabic based orthography has helped passive narrators of oral lore collaborate with researchers in order to compose literature truthful to its origins.

== Examples ==
The following examples are couplets, which is the basic building block of Soqotri poetry and song. This is a straightforward humorous piece about a stingy fisherman with easy language usage that anyone on the island could easily understand.
# / 
Translation:
# Everyone knows for certain that Abdullah is quite idiotic, walking here and there:
# He&#x27;s concealed his fish for so long that the bluebottles are swarming all around him!

The next example is a line that most Soqotrans would not find too difficult to understand either:
# / 

Literal translation:
# Greet on my behalf and make certain my greetings reach the one over there who is quite without shame.
# Who does not wipe his face clean when he has eaten, just like goats when they are feeding on the šeber plants

In order to understand this piece however, the listener has to know of the significance of the šeber plants. These plants, part of the Euphorbia plant group, survive long months of dry seasons and have a milky latex which goats often feed on in times of shortage. There is no nutritious benefit to it but, it helps rid of the goats&#x27; thirst. However, when goats feed on the latex from damaged plants, it stains their muzzles and causes sores in and around the mouth. The lines were made by a woman who had found out that her lover was bragging to others of his victories (he is being compared to the feeding goats). She is calling this out and warning other women to be careful of men of his like.

<text>George Weston (March 23, 1864 – April 6, 1924) was an American-born Canadian businessman and the founder of George Weston Limited. He worked on a Canadian bread factory in Toronto. Weston began his career at the age of 12 as a baker&#x27;s apprentice and went on to become a bread route salesman. He was also a Methodist as well as a municipal politician who served four years as alderman on Toronto City Council.

== Early years ==

George Weston was born to Ann and William Weston at Oswego, New York, in 1864. By the time George turned four, the family, British immigrants who first settled in Canada, had returned to Toronto after some time in the United States. On completing public school, George was sent out into the workforce.

== Baking career ==

Young George was apprenticed to C.J. Frogley, a baker with a small shop at 850 Yonge Street, north of Bloor Street, then on the outskirts of Toronto in 1876. After a number of years, Frogley abandoned the location, and another baker by the name of G.H. Bowen eventually set up shop there. After a year or so, Bowen moved the bakery to Sullivan Street, not far from today&#x27;s Art Gallery of Ontario. George found employment with Bowen, who is said to have taken enough interest to see that he &quot;learned the business the way it should be learned.&quot;
Eventually, George became a bread salesman, and in 1882, he bought a bread route from Bowen. Two years later, he bought out the bakery of his former employer. Years later, George Weston recalled those early days: &quot;I baked 250 loaves the first day. I delivered them—drove my own waggon—called on every customer myself.&quot; It was on Sullivan Street where he developed his &quot;Home-Made Bread&quot;. In 1889, the bakery was operated with two bread wagons. By 1894, it had undergone four expansions. He also introduced mechanical mixers in the creation process. By the 1890s, he had renamed his bakery &quot;G. Weston’s Bread Factory&quot;.

=== Model Bakery ===
In the fall of 1897, George Weston unveiled his new &quot;Model Bakery&quot; bread factory at the corner of Soho and Phoebe streets in Toronto. The two-story structure had an initial production that averaged 3,200 loaves a day and a capacity of 6,500 loaves. But George Weston began hearing reports from his salesmen that the competition was undercutting his prices, contrary to a local Bakers&#x27; Association agreement that set a standard price for bread of 12 cents a loaf. As Weston parted company with his fellow bakers, he lowered his prices for both his route and wholesale customers.
By 1899, in a single month, the Model Bakery delivered 231,650 three-pound loafs, more than double the factory&#x27;s original output, with bread now shipped to 38 cities and towns outside of Toronto. Two years later, the Model Bakery was supplying over 100 towns across Ontario with its bread, &quot;as far east as Prescott, as far west as Windsor, and up to North Bay.&quot;

== Amalgamations ==
In 1901, George Weston merged his operations with those of flour mill owner J.L. Spink of Pickering, Ontario, to form the Model Bakery Company, Limited. In a letter to the editor, Weston addressed rumors concerning a &quot;bread trust&quot; designed to control the bread business of Toronto, saying they were baseless and that the amalgamation was intended to do away with &quot;the middle man&#x27;s profits&quot; in order to give the public better value for their money.After a few years, the mill assets were returned to Spink, and Weston and his business partner went their separate ways. At the first annual Canadian Master Bakers&#x27; Association, held September 1902 in Toronto, George Weston delivered the concluding address on the topic of &quot;Bookkeeping methods as applied to the baking trade&quot;. Early in the new century, Weston began moving beyond bread into biscuits and sodas.

In 1911, George Weston&#x27;s bread business underwent another amalgamation with other manufacturers in Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg to form the Canada Bread Company. In merging their businesses, the Canada Bread partners agreed not to compete with the new company they had created by refraining from making bread for a ten-year period. The Model Bakery became part of the assets of Canada Bread, and George Weston became a company director. Meanwhile, a new &quot;Weston&#x27;s Biscuit Factory&quot; at the corner of Peter and Richmond streets in Toronto went into production.

== Municipal politics ==

In addition to being a business figure and churchman, George Weston also became a municipal politician, winning election as alderman on Toronto city council. Weston, who in one campaign ad promoted himself as &quot;The Businessman&#x27;s Candidate&quot;, served four successive one-year terms representing Ward Four from 1910 to 1913. He has been described as a &quot;progressive legislator&quot; by the press. In 1914, he returned full-time to his business.
== World war ==

George Weston Limited struggled through World War I&#x27;s supply shortages and remained profitable. The company also supplied biscuits to Canadian troops overseas. One photograph, taken in front of the Weston&#x27;s Biscuit Factory, showed delivery wagons with banners that read, &quot;For Our Soldier Boys Fighting in France.&quot; The eldest son Garfield Weston volunteered for overseas duty as a &quot;Sapper&quot; in the Canadian Expeditionary Force from 1917 to 1919. Garfield toured the British biscuit factories and came away convinced that a similar, high quality product could be successfully manufactured and marketed in Canada. 

It was also during this time that George Weston considered selling the company. Distraught over the death of his youngest son in a tragic accident and not sure his eldest son would return from the trenches of France, he received an offer from competitor Christie, Brown and Company to buy George Weston Limited. He wrote to Garfield asking for his advice. Garfield wrote back, asking his father not to sell and telling him to hold on until his return from the war.

=== English Quality Biscuits ===
On his return from war in 1919, Garfield Weston rejoined his father&#x27;s firm and he soon began taking on managerial responsibilities, first promoted to company vice president and then general manager. In 1921, with the ten-year agreement barring the company from manufacturing bread having expired, George Weston went back to baking bread. It was around this time that Garfield convinced his father to import biscuit ovens and machinery from England. The result was the successful launch of &quot;Weston’s English Quality Biscuits&quot; in 1922. Two months later, the company reported its production line working 24 hours a day, trying to keep up with demand. It soon began adding additional varieties of biscuits to the new line, promoted with the slogan, &quot;Biscuits as They Are Made in England.&quot;

== Death ==
George Weston died from a stroke in April 1924, when he was 59.

With the death of George Weston, W. Garfield Weston became president of George Weston Limited. He soon began a program of expansion and acquisition.

In October 2008, the Ontario Heritage Trust unveiled a provincial plaque commemorating George Weston at the site of his former Model Bakery bread factory in Toronto.
