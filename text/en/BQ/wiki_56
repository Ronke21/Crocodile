<text>Citizen journalism, also known as collaborative media, participatory journalism, democratic journalism, guerrilla journalism, grassroots journalism, or street journalism, is based upon members of the community playing an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information. Courtney C. Radsch defines citizen journalism &quot;as an alternative and activist form of news gathering and reporting that functions outside mainstream media institutions, often as a response to shortcomings in the professional journalistic field, that uses similar journalistic practices but is driven by different objectives and ideals and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy than traditional or mainstream journalism&quot;. Jay Rosen offers a simpler definition: &quot;When the people formerly known as the audience employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform one another.&quot; The underlying principle of citizen journalism is that ordinary people, not professional journalists, can be the main creators and distributors of news. Citizen journalism should not be confused with community journalism or civic journalism, both of which are practiced by professional journalists; collaborative journalism, which is the practice of professional and non-professional journalists working together; and social journalism, which denotes a digital publication with a hybrid of professional and non-professional journalism. Seungahn Nah and Deborah S. Chung say in their book &quot;Understanding Citizen Journalism as Civic Participation&quot; that citizen journalism is &quot;highly embedded in local communities where community residents engage in day-to-day routines of community storytelling about local politics, public affairs, community events, neighborhood issues, schools, public transportation, land uses and environments, and much more.&quot;

Citizen journalism is a specific form of both citizen media and user-generated content (UGC). By juxtaposing the term &quot;citizen&quot;, with its attendant qualities of civic-mindedness and social responsibility, with that of &quot;journalism&quot;, which refers to a particular profession, Courtney C. Radsch argues that this term best describes this particular form of &quot;online&quot; and &quot;digital&quot; journalism conducted by amateurs because it underscores the link between the practice of journalism and its relation to the political and public sphere.

Citizen journalism was made more feasible by the development of various online internet platforms. New media technology, such as social networking and media-sharing websites, in addition to the increasing prevalence of cellular telephones, have made citizen journalism more accessible to people worldwide. Recent advances in new media have started to have a profound political impact. Due to the availability of technology, citizens often can report breaking news more quickly than traditional media reporters. Notable examples of citizen journalism reporting from major world events are, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Arab Spring, the Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2013 protests in Turkey, the Euromaidan events in Ukraine, and Syrian Civil War, the 2014 Ferguson unrest, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine. 

Being that citizen journalism is yet to develop a conceptual framework and guiding principles, it can be heavily opinionated and subjective, making it more supplemental than primary in terms of forming public opinion. Critics of the phenomenon, including professional journalists and news organizations, claim that citizen journalism is unregulated, amateur, and in quality and coverage. Furthermore, citizen journalists, due to their lack of professional affiliation, are thought to lack resources as well as focus on how best to serve the public. A research team of citizen journalists created an OER library that contains video interviews to provide access to reliable sources.

==Theory==
Citizen journalism, as a form of alternative media, presents a &quot;radical challenge to the professionalized and institutionalized practices of the mainstream media&quot;.

According to Flew, there have been three elements critical to the rise of citizen journalism: open publishing, collaborative editing, and distributed content. Mark Glaser said in 2006:

…people without professional journalism training can use the tools of modern technology and the global distribution of the Internet to create, augment or fact-check media on their own or in collaboration with others.

In &quot;What is Participatory Journalism?&quot; (2003), J. D. Lasica classifies media for citizen journalism into the following types:

# Audience participation (such as user comments attached to news stories, personal blogs, photographs or video footage captured from personal mobile cameras, or local news written by residents of a community)
# Independent news and information Websites (Consumer Reports, the Drudge Report)
# Full-fledged participatory news sites (one:convo, NowPublic, OhmyNews, DigitalJournal.com, GroundReport, &#x27;Fair Observer&#x27;)
# Collaborative and contributory media sites (Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Newsvine)
# Other kinds of &quot;thin media&quot; (mailing lists, email newsletters)
# Personal broadcasting sites (video broadcast sites such as KenRadio)
# Open source news platforms (such as Veiwapp and Wikinews)

The literature of citizen, alternative, and participatory journalism is most often situated in a democratic context and theorized as a response to corporate news media dominated by an economic logic. Some scholars have sought to extend the study of citizen journalism beyond the developed Western world, including Sylvia Moretzsohn, Courtney C. Radsch, and Clemencia Rodríguez. Radsch, for example, wrote that &quot;Throughout the Arab world, citizen journalists have emerged as the vanguard of new social movements dedicated to promoting human rights and democratic values.&quot;

=== Theories of citizenship ===
According to Vincent Campbell, theories of citizenship can be categorized into two core groups: those that consider journalism &quot;for&quot; citizenship, and those that consider journalism &quot;as&quot; citizenship. The classical model of citizenship is the base of the two theories of citizenship. The classical model is rooted in the ideology of informed citizens and places emphasis on the role of journalists rather than on citizens.

The classical model has four main characteristics:
* journalists&#x27; role of informing citizens
* citizens are assumed to be informed if they regularly attend to the news they are supplied with
* more informed citizens are more likely to participate
* the more informed citizens participate, the more democratic a state is more likely to be.

The first characteristic upholds the theory that journalism is &quot;for&quot; citizens. One of the main issues with this is that there is a normative judgement surrounding the amount and nature of information that citizens should have as well as what the relationship between the two should be. One branch of journalism &quot;for&quot; citizens is the &quot;monitorial citizen&quot; (coined by Michael Schudson). The &quot;monitorial citizen&quot; suggests that citizens appropriately and strategically select what news and information they consume. The &quot;monitorial citizen&quot; along with other forms of this ideology conceive individuals as those who do things with information to enact change and citizenship. However, this production of information does not equal to an act of citizenship, but instead an act of journalism. Therefore, citizens and journalists are portrayed as distinctive roles whereas journalism is used by citizens &quot;for&quot; citizenship and conversely, journalists serve citizens.

The second theory considers journalism &quot;as&quot; citizenship. This theory focuses on the different aspects of citizen identity and activity and understands citizen journalism as directly constituting citizenship. The term &quot;liquid citizenship&quot; (coined by Zizi Papacharissi) depicts how the lifestyles that individuals engage in allow them to interact with other individuals and organizations, which thus remaps the conceptual periphery of civic, political, and social. This &quot;liquid citizenship&quot; allows the interactions and experiences that individuals face to become citizen journalism where they create their own forms of journalism. An alternative approach of journalism as citizenship rests between the distinction between &quot;dutiful&quot; citizens and &quot;actualizing&quot; citizens. &quot;Dutiful&quot; citizens engage in traditional citizenship practices, while &quot;actualizing&quot; citizens engage in non-traditional citizenship practices. This alternative approach suggests that &quot;actualizing&quot; citizens are less likely to use traditional media and more likely to use online and social media as sources of information, discussion, and participation. Thus, journalism in the form of online and social media practices become a form of citizenship for actualizing citizens.

Criticisms have been made against citizen journalism, especially from among professionals in the field. Citizen journalists are often portrayed as unreliable, biased and untrained as opposed to professionals who have &quot;recognition, paid work, unionized labour and behaviour that is often politically neutral and unaffiliated, at least in the claim if not in the actuality&quot;.

==History==
The idea that every citizen can engage in acts of journalism has a long history in the United States. &quot;As early as the 1920s, journalist and political commentator Walter Lippman and American philosopher John Dewey debated the role of journalism in democracy, including the extent that the public should participate in the news-gathering and production processes.&quot; According to research conducted by Blaagaard (2018), citizen journalism in St. Croix, between 1915 and 1925, provided a platform for colonized communities. Helping them express their perspectives and address certain social injustices that were overlooked at the time by colonial authorities. Local publications, for example &quot;The Herald,&quot; became a pathway for unheard voices to challenge dominant narratives. The contemporary citizen journalist movement emerged after journalists began to question the predictability of their coverage of events such as the 1988 U.S. presidential election. Those journalists became part of the public, or civic, journalism movement, which sought to counter the erosion of trust in the news media and the widespread disillusionment with politics and civic affairs.

Initially, discussions of public journalism focused on promoting journalism that was &quot;for the people&quot; by changing the way professional reporters did their work. According to Leonard Witt, however, early public journalism efforts were &quot;often part of &#x27;special projects&#x27; that were expensive, time-consuming, and episodic. Too often these projects dealt with an issue and moved on. Professional journalists were driving the discussion. They would have the goal of doing a story on welfare-to-work (or the environment, or traffic problems, or the economy), and then they would recruit a cross-section of citizens and chronicle their points of view. Since not all reporters and editors bought into this form of public journalism, and some outright opposed it, reaching out to the people from the newsroom was never an easy task.&quot; By 2003, in fact, the movement seemed to be petering out, with the Pew Center for Civic Journalism closing its doors.

Traditionally, the term &quot;citizen journalism&quot; has had a history of struggle with deliberating on a concise and mutually agreed upon definition. Even today, the term lacks a clear form of conceptualization. Although the term lacks conceptualization, alternative names of the term are unable to comprehensively capture the phenomenon. For example, one of the interchangeable names with &quot;citizen journalism&quot; is &quot;user-generated content&quot; (UGC). However, the issue with this alternative term is that it eliminates the potential civic virtues of citizen journalism and considers it to be stunted and proprietorial.

With today&#x27;s technology the citizen journalist movement has found new life as the average person can capture news and distribute it globally. As Yochai Benkler has noted, &quot;the capacity to make meaning to encode and decode humanly meaningful statements and the capacity to communicate one&#x27;s meaning around the world, are held by, or readily available to, at least many hundreds of millions of users around the globe.&quot; Professor Mary-Rose Papandrea, a constitutional law professor at UNC School of Law, notes in her article, &quot;Citizen Journalism and the Reporter&#x27;s Privilege&quot;, that:

::&quot;[i]n many ways, the definition of &quot;journalism&quot; has now come full circle. When the First Amendment was adopted, &quot;freedom of the press&quot; referred quite literally to the freedom to publish using a printing press, rather than the freedom of organized entities engaged in the publishing business. … It was not until the late nineteenth century that the concept of the &quot;press&quot; morphed into a description of individuals and companies engaged in an often competitive commercial media enterprise.&quot;

A 2004 trend of citizen journalism has been the emergence of what blogger Jeff Jarvis terms hyperlocal journalism, as online news sites invite contributions from local residents of their subscription areas, who often report on topics that conventional newspapers tend to ignore. &quot;We are the traditional journalism model turned upside down,&quot; explains Mary Lou Fulton, the publisher of the Northwest Voice in Bakersfield, California. &quot;Instead of being the gatekeeper, telling people that what&#x27;s important to them &#x27;isn&#x27;t news,&#x27; we&#x27;re just opening up the gates and letting people come on in. We are a better community newspaper for having thousands of readers who serve as the eyes and ears for the Voice, rather than having everything filtered through the views of a small group of reporters and editors.&quot;

==Citizen journalists==
According to Jay Rosen, citizen journalists are &quot;the people formerly known as the audience,&quot; who &quot;&quot;were&quot; on the receiving end of a media system that ran one way, in a broadcasting pattern, with high entry fees and a few firms competing to speak very loudly while the rest of the population listened in isolation from one another— and who &quot;today&quot; are not in a situation like that &quot;at all&quot;. ... The people formerly known as the audience are simply the public made realer, less fictional, more able, less predictable.&quot;

Abraham Zapruder, who filmed the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy with a home-movie camera, is sometimes presented as an ancestor to citizen journalists. Egyptian citizen Wael Abbas was awarded several international reporting prizes for his blog Misr Digital (Digital Egypt) and a video he publicized of two policemen beating a bus driver helped lead to their conviction.

During 9/11 many eyewitness accounts of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center came from citizen journalists. Images and stories from citizen journalists close to the World Trade Center offered content that played a major role in the story.

In 2004, when the 9.1-magnitude underwater earthquake caused a huge tsunami in Banda Aceh Indonesia and across the Indian Ocean, a weblog-based virtual network of previously unrelated bloggers emerged that covered the news in real-time, and became a vital source for the traditional media for the first week after the tsunami.
A large amount of news footage from many people who experienced the tsunami was widely broadcast, as well as a good deal of &quot;on the scene&quot; citizen reporting and blogger analysis that was subsequently picked up by the major media outlets worldwide.

Subsequent to the citizen journalism coverage of the disaster and aftermath, researchers have suggested that citizen journalists may, in fact, play a critical role in the disaster warning system itself, potentially with higher reliability than the networks of tsunami warning equipment based on technology alone which then require interpretation by disinterested third parties.

The microblog Twitter played an important role during the 2009 Iranian election protests, after foreign journalists had effectively been &quot;barred from reporting&quot;. Twitter delayed scheduled maintenance during the protests that would have shut down coverage in Iran due to the role it played in public communication.

Social media platforms such as blogs, YouTube, and Twitter encourage and facilitate engagement with other citizens who participate in creating content through commenting, liking, linking, and sharing. The majority of the content produced by these amateur news bloggers was not original content, but curated information monitored and edited by these various bloggers. There has been a decline in the amateur news blogger due to social media platforms that are much easier to run and maintain, allowing individuals to easily share and create and content.

== Citizen journalism in a worldwide context ==

=== India ===

India has a broad media landscape expanding at &quot;double-digit growth rates&quot; in comparison to the West. Issues surrounding human rights violations, violence against women and everyday witness accounts. Most notably, images shared on Twitter during the 2008 Mumbai attacks is an example of citizen journalism in India.

=== Iraq ===
In 2004 Daylight Magazine sent a box of disposable cameras to be distributed to civilians living in Baghdad and Fallujah. These were published in May 2004 along with the work of seminal documentarians such as Susan Meiselas, Roger Hutchings, etc. In June 2004 Fred Ritchen and Pixel Press teamed up with Daylight to create a touring exhibition of the images and captions which went to various institutions around the United States including: The Council on Foreign Relations, The Center for Photography Woodstock, New York University, Union College, Michigan University, and Central Michigan University before being donated to the Archive of Documentary Art at Duke University.

=== United Kingdom ===
Citizen Journalism provides a platform for individuals to be considered and acknowledged on a global scale. The circulation of information and news does not fully divulge the accurate perceptions of what is going on in the world. For instance, On Our Radar contains reporting mechanisms and trained residents that reveal their voices while questioning the reluctance journalism has when considering what voices are heard and are not, based in London. On Our Radar has undertaken in making the voices in Sierra Leone heard in regards to Ebola, revealing that it contained easy access to vital sources of  information and opened more opportunities for questions and reports.

Depending on the country one resides in, as societies evolve, grow, and depend more on online media outlets there is an increase of informed individuals, especially with topics regarding politics and government news. Through such evolution, citizen journalism has the capability to reach an audience that has not had the privilege of receiving higher education and still remain informed about what is surrounding them and their respective country. As demonstrated in light of demanding and distorted information given to the mass public and cleared by strong demonstrations of the capabilities of citizen journalism. Citizen journalism is a platform that provides a solution to the mistrust the public has towards the government as discrepancies arise from governmental statements and actions.

In 2020, a network of local Citizen Journalist publications, the Bylines Network, was founded, and has since spread to include 10 regional branches and a podcast.

=== United States ===
Citizen Journalism can even be found in the United States, here we can find them at the frontlines at places such as protests. In a blog from Syracuse University they mention &quot;From gun violence to mass deportations to sexual misconduct accusations leveled at powerful men, there is no shortage of reasons for the polarized American electorate to take to the streets in protest.&quot; Because social media has changed the role of the traditional news reporter, these types of events now allow for citizen journalists to keep the public informed. The blog reports that &quot;At the same time, the rise of social media has irrevocably changed the roles of news reporters and has also enabled citizen journalists, who take risks to document highly contentious environments in order to keep the public informed.&quot; Citizen Journalists have an important duty in today&#x27;s world.

=== China ===
Citizen journalism has created much change and influence within Chinese media and society in which its online activity is very much controlled. The interconnection built from citizen journalism and mainstream journalism in China has allotted politically and socially charged information to be distributed to promote progressive changes and serves as national sentiments. In doing so, the mass public of China has the opportunities to move around the controlled and monitored online presence and the information it contains.

Citizen journalists face many repercussions when unpackaging the truth and reach domestic and global audiences. Most if not all of these repercussions result from government officials and law enforcement from the journalists respective countries. Citizen journalists are needed and depended on by the mass public but are viewed as an imminent threat to their governments. The public has had the resources to pursue this level of journalism from their surroundings and based on real life perspectives that lack censorship and influence from a higher entity. The various forms citizen journalism is formed has outdated many news and media sources as result of the authentic approach citizen journalists carry out.

During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, fraudulent pictures encouraging people to pose as reporters and abuse freedom of press regulations to obstruct the police were widely circulated on social media with the aim to discredit citizen journalists.

In the context of China and the national pandemic rooted from the coronavirus, many voices were censored and limited when it came to citizen journalists. This occurred in the process of visually and vocally documenting the social climate of China in regards to the coronavirus. For instance, a Chinese citizen journalist posted videos of Wuhan, China as the outbreak had been spreading globally. As a result, the journalist was stopped and detained by the police and was not released for two months. In sharing their experience being detained after being released the tone it was expressed in was marketed. This citizen journalist experience is one amongst more of who were similarly detained and censored.

===Iran===
In 2023 after Mahsa Amini protests government criminalized Iranians filming police.

==Criticisms==

===Objectivity===
Citizen journalists also may be activists within the communities they write about. This has drawn some criticism from traditional media institutions such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which have accused proponents of public journalism of abandoning the traditional goal of objectivity. Researchers have also criticized this practice as not having access to real time fact checking. Many traditional journalists view citizen journalism with some skepticism, believing that only trained journalists can understand the exactitude and ethics involved in reporting news. See, e.g., Nicholas Lemann, Vincent Maher, and Tom Grubisich.

An academic paper by Vincent Maher, the head of the New Media Lab at Rhodes University, outlined several weaknesses in the claims made by citizen journalists, in terms of the &quot;three deadly E&#x27;s&quot;, referring to ethics, economics, and epistemology.

An analysis by language and linguistics professor, Patricia Bou-Franch, found that some citizen journalists resorted to abuse-sustaining discourses naturalizing violence against women. She found that these discourses were then challenged by others who questioned the gendered ideologies of male violence against women.

===Quality===
An article in 2005 by Tom Grubisich reviewed ten new citizen journalism sites and found many of them lacking in quality and content. Grubisich followed up a year later with, &quot;Potemkin Village Redux.&quot; He found that the best sites had improved editorially and were even nearing profitability, but only by not expensing editorial costs. Also according to the article, the sites with the weakest editorial content were able to expand aggressively because they had stronger financial resources.

Another article published on Pressthink examined Backfence, a citizen journalism site with three initial locations in the D.C. area, which reveals that the site has only attracted limited citizen contributions. The author concludes that, &quot;in fact, clicking through Backfence&#x27;s pages feels like frontier land – remote, often lonely, zoned for people but not home to any. The site recently launched for Arlington, Virginia. However, without more settlers, Backfence may wind up creating more ghost towns.&quot;

David Simon, a former reporter for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and writer-producer of the television series &quot;The Wire&quot;, criticized the concept of citizen journalism, claiming that unpaid bloggers who write as a hobby cannot replace trained, professional, seasoned journalists.
An editorial published by &quot;The Digital Journalist&quot; web magazine expressed a similar position, advocating to abolish the term &quot;citizen journalist&quot; and replace it with &quot;citizen news gatherer&quot;.
While the fact that citizen journalists can report in real time and are not subject to oversight opens them to criticism about the accuracy of their reporting, news stories presented by mainstream media also misreport facts occasionally that are reported correctly by citizen journalists. As low as 32% of the American population have a fair amount of trust in the media.

=== Effects on traditional journalism ===

Journalism has been affected significantly due to citizen journalism. This is because citizen journalism allows people to post as much content as they want, whenever they want. In order to stay competitive, traditional news sources are forcing their journalists to compete. This means that journalists now have to write, edit and add pictures into their content and they must do so at a rapid pace, as it is perceived by news companies that it&#x27;s essential for journalists to produce content at the same rate that citizens can post content on the internet. This is hard though, as many news companies are facing budget cuts and cannot afford to pay journalists the proper amount for the amount of work they do. Despite the uncertainties of a job in journalism and rising tuition costs there has been a 35% increase in journalism majors throughout the past few years according to Astra Taylor in her book &quot;The People&#x27;s Platform&quot;.

===Legal repercussions===
Edward Greenberg, a New York City litigator, notes higher vulnerability of unprofessional journalists in court compared to the professional ones:
The view stated above does not mean that professional journalists are fully protected by shield laws. In the 1972 &quot;Branzburg v. Hayes&quot; case the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated the use of the First Amendment as a defense for reporters summoned to testify before a grand jury. In 2005, the reporter&#x27;s privilege of Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper was rejected by the appellate court.

== Possible future ==

Citizen journalism increased during the last decade of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century, associated with the creation of the internet which introduced new ways in communicating and engaging news. In 2004 Leonard Witt wrote in the National Civic Review, &quot;the voices of a range of citizens are being heard loud and clear on the Internet, mostly through Weblogs.&quot; Due to this shift in technology, individuals were able to access more news than previously and at a much faster rate. This larger quantity also made it so there was a larger variety of sources which people were able to consume media and news.

Citizen journalism has proven itself to be an effective form of current event coverage and can possibly signify a shift in modern media. Citizen journalism has been expanding in different varieties of modern media which include, international news, more democratic journalism, mainstream media, and the importance for mass media outlets. Citizen journalism is now one of the main contributors of mainstream news and consistently feeding in information that even traditional journalist can&#x27;t grasp their hands on. This could eventually lead to citizen journalism to become one of the main sources for news everywhere as the internet and constant information being provided by citizen journalist are key factors contributing to citizen journalism increasing.

Natalie Fenton discusses the role of citizen journalism within the digital age and has three characteristics associated with the topic: speed and space, multiplicity and poly-centrality, and interactivity and participation.

=== Current instances of citizen journalism ===
Citizen journalism has become a recent topic of discussion regarding its efficacy in documenting the downfall of popular cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. This recent instance of popular media relying on citizen journalism marks the ever-expanding development of the pseudo-reporting strategy. This recent instance of popular media relying on citizen journalism marks the ever-expanding development of the pseudo-reporting strategy. There is a measurable decrease in interest in traditional news sources as more become disinterested by apparent bias and political influence. Utilizing popular video-sharing platforms such as YouTube, expanded the concept of citizen journalism. This allowed individuals to upload and share content with a more global audience. This platform became instrumental during events like Arab Spring where people documented protests and government responses.
Dan Gillmor, the former technology columnist for the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, founded a nonprofit, the Center for Citizen Media, (2005–2009) to help promote it.

Professor Charles Nesson, William F. Weld Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the founder of the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, chairs the advisory board for Jamaican citizen journalism startup On the Ground News Reports.

Maurice Ali founded one of the first international citizen journalist associations, the International Association of Independent Journalists Inc. (IAIJ), in 2003. The association through its President (Maurice Ali) published studies and articles on citizen journalism, attended and spoken at UNESCO and United Nations events such as a speech in General Assembly at the WSIS+10 meetings that finally recognized internationally, &quot;citizen journalists&quot; as &quot;journalists&quot; with protections, by majority vote of member nations and announced in the final UN Resolution of WSIS+10 (sections 44/45 of that document).

Elon Musk advocates for citizen journalism, urging X (formerly Twitter) users to share real-time text and video updates on unfolding events. He believes that citizen journalism is the future of journalism and that it can enhance transparency and democratize information dissemination.

<text>Elise Richter (2 March 1865 – 23 June 1943) was an Austrian philologist, specialising in Romance studies, and university professor. She was the first woman to achieve the habilitation at the University of Vienna(which is equivalent to being accepted as a full badge member of the German-speaking research community), the first female associate professor and the only woman at any Austrian university before World War I to hold an academic appointment. Persecuted like all other members of her family, by Nazi officials during World War II, she was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in German-occupied Czechoslovakia in October 1942, and was murdered there, like her English PhD holder sister Helene. Elise was killed in June 1943, half a year after her sister.

==Biography==
Born in Vienna, Austria, on 2 March 1865, to a middle-class, non-practicing Jewish family, Elise Richter was the daughter of Emilie Richter and Maximilian Richter, the chief physician of the Austrian Southern Railway Company. Her sister Helene Richter, four years older than Elise, became known as an anglicist and theatre scholar, writing about and translating English literature and drama. Elise Richter developed rheumatoid arthritis as a young woman, and was confined to bed for a year during her early 20s. The two women grew closer, following the deaths of their mother and father, respectively, in 1889 and 1891. Traveling together, they also encouraged each other to continue their respective academic pursuits.

As girls were excluded from formal higher education at the time, Richter and her two sisters (one of them died at a young age) were initially educated at home by the family&#x27;s Prussian governess. During the 1890s, Helene and Elise Richter audited university courses with special permission from certain professors. It was not until 1896 that girls were admitted to the &quot;Matura&quot; examination (general university entrance qualification), which Elise Richter passed the following year, at the age of 32. Then she enrolled at the University of Vienna as a student of Classical, Indo-European and Romance philology under Adolph Mussafia and Wilhelm Meyer-Lubke, and then became one of the first women ever to be awarded a Doctorate from that university in 1901. That degree was awarded &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. 

In 1905, she became the first woman to receive the habilitation for her work on Romance languages. Two years later, she became the first female &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (assistant professor) at the University of Vienna. Her inaugural lecture on &quot;the history of indeclinables&quot; was moved to another lecture hall to avoid disruption by militant Catholic and German nationalist students who took offense not only at Richter&#x27;s gender but also at her Jewish roots. In 1921, she became the first woman in Austria to be appointed as an untenured professor &quot;(außerordentlicher Professor)&quot;. However, she never received an ordinary professorship. 

In their home in the &quot;cottage quarter&quot; of Währing, Elise and Helene Richter hosted a weekly salon for intellectuals and artists, starting in 1906. Among their regular guests were the women&#x27;s rights activists Marianne Hainisch and Rosa Mayreder, music critic Max Kalbeck, and Burgtheater director Hugo Thimig. In 1911 both Richter sisters were baptised in Vienna&#x27;s Lutheran City Church. Beginning in 1920, she chaired the Association of Austrian Academic Women (&quot;Verband der Akademikerinnen Österreichs&quot;). In 1922, Elise Richter founded the Austrian Federation of University Women.

After the 1938 Anschluss, and the introduction of Nazi anti-semitic policies in Austria, which excluded people of Jewish origin from public life, Richter was denied access to the university&#x27;s library, dismissed from her post, denied pension support in her old age, and prohibited from visiting museums and other cultural institutions. In addition, her personal library, which held 3,000 items, and other possessions were confiscated. She and her sister, Helene, who lived with her, were then deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp on 9 October 1942, on Transport IV/13, number 598. Helene was 81 when she died there on 8 November 1942. Elise was 78 when she died there on 21 June 1943.

The Elise Richter Program of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), which provides financial support for female postdoc researchers aiming for a professorship, is named in her honour.

<text>USS &quot;Congress&quot; was a United States Navy frigate in operation between 1842 and 1862. The fourth Navy ship to carry the name &quot;Congress&quot;, she served in the Mediterranean, South Atlantic Ocean, and in the Pacific Ocean. She continued to operate as an American warship until the American Civil War, when she was sunk by the ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; in battle of Newport News, Virginia, in 1862.

==Service history==
&quot;Congress&quot; was launched at the Portsmouth Navy Yard on August 16, 1841 and placed in commission under Captain Philip Voorhees on May 7, 1842. Her first cruise, starting on July 15, took her to the Mediterranean for service with the Squadron of Commodores Charles W. Morgan and Charles Morris. In December 1843, Voorhees joined Commodore Daniel Turner&#x27;s Brazil Squadron blockading Montevideo in safeguarding U.S. trade during the Uruguayan Civil War. On September 29, 1844, Voorhees captured an armed Argentine schooner that delivered a mail to the Argentine commanding officer. This overreaction damaged the US-Argentina relation and resulted in a court martial for Voorhees. His impetuosity resulted in a few months suspension, for Voorhees, but did little damage to his career. &quot;Congress&quot; remained active in the theatre until January 1845. She was then placed in ordinary at Norfolk, Virginia in March.

&quot;Congress&quot; was recommissioned on September 15, 1845, as flagship of Commodore Robert F. Stockton and sailed for the Pacific Ocean in late October. After landing the U.S. Commissioner to the Sandwich Islands at Honolulu, Hawaii on June 10, she proceeded to Monterey Bay where she joined the Pacific Squadron. Captain Elie A. F. La Vallette assumed command on July 20 and employed her along the west coast during the Mexican–American War. Large detachments of her crew participated in battles on Rio San Gabriel and the plains of La Mesa, and in the occupation of Los Angeles. She assisted in the bombardment and capture of Guaymas in October 1847, and in November furnished a detachment that aided in the occupation of Mazatlán. On August 23, 1848, she departed La Paz, Baja California Sur for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving the following January to be placed in ordinary.

In May 1850, she was assigned a threefold mission; protect U.S. interests between the mouth of the Amazon River and Cape Horn, prevent the use of the American flag to cover the African slave trade, and maintain neutral rights during hostilities among the South American countries. Departing Hampton Roads, Virginia on June 12, she arrived at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on September 1 and assumed duty as flagship of the Brazil Squadron under Commodore Issac McKeever until June 1853. She returned to New York City on July 20 for decommissioning. On June 19, 1855, &quot;Congress&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean and there followed two years as flagship of Commodore Samuel Livingston Breese. Sailing from Spezia, Italy on November 26, 1857, she arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on January 13, 1858, and was placed out of commission. In 1859, &quot;Congress&quot; was reassigned as flagship of Commodore Joshua R. Sands and the Brazil Squadron, remaining in that area until the Civil War precipitated her return to Boston, Massachusetts on August 22, 1861.

===American Civil War service===

On September 9, 1861, she was ordered to duty under command of Capt. Louis M. Goldsborough in the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, later to serve under commanding officer W. Smith, and executive officer Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith.

&quot;Congress&quot; was anchored off Newport News, Virginia, as part of the Union blockade of that port on March 8, 1862, when she fell under attack by the Confederate ironclad, CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; (ex-USS &quot;Merrimack&quot;) and five other small ships. Serving aboard &quot;Congress&quot; at this time was McKean Buchanan, brother of the commanding officer of the &quot;Virginia&quot;, Franklin Buchanan. After exchanging broadsides with &quot;Virginia&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot; slipped her moorings and ran aground in shallow water.

The ironclad and her consorts attacked from a distance and inflicted great damage on the ship, killing 120, including the commanding officer, Joseph B. Smith. Executive officer Austin Pendergrast assumed command. Ablaze in several places and unable to bring guns to bear on the enemy, &quot;Congress&quot; was forced to strike her colors and raise a white flag. Heavy shore batteries prevented &quot;Virginia&quot; from taking possession. Instead she fired several rounds of hot shot (red-hot cannonballs) and incendiary causing &quot;Congress&quot; to burn to the water&#x27;s edge, and her magazine to explode. Lt. Smith, having been in command at the time, died in the action. Eventually, during the battle, &quot;Congress&quot; sank by the stern. In September 1865, &quot;Congress&quot; was raised and taken to the Norfolk Navy Yard where she was later sold. She later was stripped for the valuable wood and metal near her mast. The sails later were used to make a flag in memory of the ship.

<doc id="498643" wikidata="Q3471654" url="?curid=498643" title="San Ysidro, San Diego">
<text>San Ysidro (Californio Spanish for for &quot;St. Isidore&quot;, ) is a district of San Diego, California, immediately north of the Mexico–United States border. It neighbors Otay Mesa West to the north, Otay Mesa to the east, and Nestor and the Tijuana River Valley to the west; together these communities form South San Diego, a practical exclave of the City of San Diego. Major thoroughfares include Beyer Boulevard and San Ysidro Boulevard.

==History==
===1829–1848: Rancho Tía Juana===
After independence from Spain in 1822, the Mexican government started issuing land grants for ranchos. In 1829 it granted Santiago Argüello Moraga the 10,000-acre Rancho Tía Juana, which covered parts of what now are San Ysidro and Tijuana; his son Emigdio Argüello was granted the adjacent Rancho Melijo in 1833, on which they built &quot;La Punta&quot;, an adobe house that was one of very few structures in the area until the late 1800s.

===1848–1922: Early U.S. period===
After the 1846 Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded what is now the Southwest U.S. in 1848. San Ysidro found itself on an international border. The border was marked in the mid-1860s and the first customs building was erected in 1873. The border was unfenced until one was built in 1910 from the Pacific Ocean to Otay Mountain.

==== 1887–1895: Tia Juana City ====
San Diego was connected to the U.S. railroad network in 1885, spurring a real estate boom. In 1887, real estate firm Hart and Stern developed Tia Juana City on the site of today&#x27;s Las Americas Premium Outlets, consisting of a single street with a drug store, saloon, hotel and boot shop and some scattered houses beyond. Floods washed out buildings in 1891 and 1895; Tia Juana City was not immediately rebuilt and settlers moved to higher ground.

==== 1908–1916: Little Landers ====
The Little Landers colony was a community founded by William Ellsworth Smythe in 1908 with the motto, &quot;A little land and a living surely is better than desperate struggle and wealth possibly.&quot; Each member of the community held a plot of land no bigger than they could cultivate themselves, averaging each, in order to foster a non-hierarchical social structure. Every person had an equal voice in the affairs of the community whose business affairs was conducted by a board of directors voted in by the community. All agricultural buying and selling was pooled on a cooperative basis. Members agreed to forfeit their land should they leave the community.

The city levied a commission on the sale of land which funded public improvements such as a library, park, irrigation systems, and a clubhouse. They maintained a retail market in San Diego where harvested produce was sold. In addition to growing vegetables, the community raised and marketed ducks, rabbits, and goats.

The Little Landers community is known as one of the nation&#x27;s first communes. It lasted until a major flood wiped out its farms in 1916. The George Belcher homestead is the oldest surviving building in San Ysidro.

George Smythe named the new settlement San Ysidro, the archaic spelling of Saint Isidore the Laborer&#x27;s name in Spanish (&quot;San Isidro&quot;).

===1922–1957: residential community and border town===

With the rise of Tijuana, Mexico as a racing, gambling, drinking and entertainment destination in the 1920s, many American employees of these establishments lived in San Ysidro and worked in Tijuana. By 1922, twenty new modest homes had been built in San Ysidro for working class residents, &quot;Some [of whom worked for the]... Tijuana’s Lower California Jockey Club racetrack... others worked in Mexican saloons and gambling halls.&quot;

In 1924, the $12,000 San Ysidro Free Public Library opened; civic leader Frank Beyer donated the land as well as $7,000 towards the cost. The Louis Gill-designed San Ysidro Community Church opened in 1924, and the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church opened a few years later. The San Ysidro Bank and the Civic and Recreation Center opened in 1925. Beyer donated the land for the Civic Center. In 1931, the old customs facility was replaced with the existing historic landmark customs building.
After 1933, with alcohol legalized in the U.S., gambling outlawed in Mexico and fewer American visitors to Tijuana, some homes were purchased by Mexican citizens working in the U.S.

Following World War Two, there was a housing shortage in San Diego and as a result, new houses, apartment buildings and bungalow courts were built in San Ysidro.

According to the San Diego city planning department, at this point San Ysidro was &quot;now a full- fledged city that supported the various economic, social, religious, and recreational needs of the residents and visitors.&quot;

=== 1957-Present: Part of San Diego ===

==== Annexation ====
San Ysidro, along with the rest of South San Diego, was annexed by the city of San Diego in 1957; an attempt by residents in 1973 to reverse the decision was unsuccessful.

==== 1984 massacre ====
On July 18, 1984, James Oliver Huberty, a 41-year-old former welder from Canton, Ohio, opened fire inside a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant with multiple firearms (including an Uzi), killing 21 people and injuring an additional 19 people, before he was fatally shot by a sniper from a SWAT team. The McDonald&#x27;s site was razed in 1985. The site is now home to a Southwestern College satellite campus. It was the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history until the 1991 Luby&#x27;s massacre in Texas, and remains the deadliest in California history.

==Border crossing==


San Ysidro is home to the fourth busiest land border crossing in the world. It is the second-busiest border crossing between two sovereign nations (after the Johor–Singapore Causeway) and the busiest border crossing in the Western Hemisphere.

Statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation state more than 15 million vehicles and 36.7 million people entered the United States at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in 2019. The great majority of these are workers (both of Mexican and U.S. nationality) commuting from Tijuana to jobs in the greater San Diego area and throughout southern California. There is also reverse traffic, both of workers traveling to maquiladoras in Mexico and those purchasing services or seeking entertainment in Tijuana. 2009 studies estimated that wait times for vehicles at the San Ysidro LPOE averaged 1.5 to 2 hours during the commuter peak period.

For pedestrians, in 2012, morning waits to enter the United States could last more than two hours — and twice that time during peak weekend periods. Roughly one-fifth of the 25,000 daily northbound crossers remained in San Ysidro to work, shop, visit family etc., according to the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce. Many more boarded the San Diego Trolley or other public transportation to work, schools, stores, banks, medical appointments and family gatherings across San Diego County. In 2016 a second pedestrian crossing was opened, &quot;PedWest&quot;, connecting Plaza Viva Tijuana via a walkway to the border next to the El Chaparral auto crossing, with Virginia Avenue in San Ysidro.

San Ysidro is also where ICE deports the most Mexicans back into Mexico; in 2003, this was 360,172 people.

Trucks cannot use the San Ysidro crossing and must use the Otay Mesa Port of Entry instead.

An expansion of the San Ysidro Port of Entry took place in three parts and was completed in 2019. The $741 million project expanded and veered Interstate 5 to the west. A new northbound inspection facility was built, including primary vehicle inspection booths, a secondary inspection area, an administration space, and a pedestrian-processing facility. A southbound inspection facility exists on the southbound crossing, operated by Mexican customs in Tijuana.

==Demographics==
The 2010 census counted 28,008 people in San Ysidro, of whom 93% were Hispanic.

Of those over 5 years old, 60% spoke Spanish and English &quot;well&quot; or &quot;very well&quot;. 13% only spoke Spanish, and 10% spoke only English.

==Emergency services==

===Police===

<text>Killingworth is a town in North Tyneside, Tyne and Wear, England, within the historic county of Northumberland.

Killingworth was built as a new town in the 1960s, next to Killingworth Village, which existed for centuries before the new town was built. Other nearby villages include Forest Hall, West Moor and Backworth.

Killingworth has bus links to the rest of Tyne and Wear. The town is not on the Tyne and Wear Metro network; its nearest stations are Palmersville and Benton.

The town of Killingworth in Australia is named after the British original because of its extensive coal mines.

== Culture ==
Killingworth was used as a filming location for the 1973 BBC sitcom &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;, with one of the houses on Agincourt on the Highfields estate featuring as the home of Bob and Thelma Ferris.

In an episode of the architecture series &quot;Grundy&#x27;s Wonders&quot; on Tyne Tees, John Grundy deemed Killingworth&#x27;s former British Gas Research Centre to be the best industrial building in the North East.

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode titled &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot; depicted Killingworth in the 19th century, with the Sixth Doctor in search of George Stephenson, after the Doctor&#x27;s archenemy The Master attempts to hijack the Industrial Revolution. Filming of the episode took place in the 19th-century mining village at Blists Hill Open Air Museum in Ironbridge, however.

== History ==

=== Medieval ===

According to Jennifer Morrison there is no recorded evidence of early human activity at Killingworth. She asserts that this may be due in part to a lack of fieldwork in the area. Subsequent mining, spoil heaps and landscaping disturbed the stratigraphy and damaged or destroyed artifacts.

Documentary evidence for Killingworth starts in 1242 when it is recorded as part of the land held by Roger de Merlay III. There were nine recorded taxpayers in 1296, falling to eight by 1312. In a survey of the township dated 1373 listed sixteen tenements (land holdings).

=== Division ===
Other enclosed land was kept as common land; formed Killingworth Moor. The commoners were the owners of land in Killingworth and Longbenton. Prior to enclosure Newcastle races were held on the moor from the early 17th century. Racing eventually transferred to Newcastle Town Moor.

=== 19th century ===
The 1841 Census recorded a population of 112 spread through 14 dwellings. The village consisted of two rows of cottages on both sides of the road. By the mid-nineteenth century a terrace had appeared, possibly connected with the developing mines in Killingworth and surrounding areas. To the north farms persisted. This pattern of development with 18th and 19th century stone buildings is identifiable today, though with recent infilling.

=== New town ===

Construction of Killingworth, a new town, began in 1963. Intended for 20,000 people, it was a former mining community, formed on of derelict colliery land near Killingworth Village. The building of Killingworth Township was undertaken by Northumberland County Council and was not formally a &#x27;New Town&#x27; sponsored by the Government. 
Unlike that town, Killingworth&#x27;s planners adopted a radical approach to town centre design, resulting in relatively high-rise buildings in an avant-garde and brutalist style that won awards for architecture, dynamic industry and attractive environment.

This new town centre consisted of pre-cast concrete houses, with millions of small crustacean shells unusually embedded into their external walls, 5 to 10-storey flats, offices, industrial units and service buildings, which often consisted of artistic non-functional characteristics, shops and residential multi-storey car parks, interconnected by ramps and walkways. These made up a deck system of access to shopping and other facilities, employing the Swedish Skarne method of construction.

Originally named Killingworth Township, the latter part was quickly dropped through lack of colloquial use. Killingworth is referred to as &#x27;Killy&#x27; by many residents of the town and surrounding areas.

Around 1964, during the reclamation of the derelict pit sites, a lake south of the town centre was created; spoil heaps were leveled, seeded and planted with semi-mature trees. Today, swans, ducks and local wildlife live around the two lakes, which span the main road into Killingworth. The lake is kept well stocked with fish and an angling club and model boating club regularly use it.

== Killingworth Colliery ==


Killingworth was home to a number of pits including the world-famous Killingworth Colliery owned by Lord Ravensworth. Ralph Dodds as &quot;Chief Viewer&quot; managed or trained several people of note during his lifetime including his nephew Isaac Dodds, locomotive engineer George Stephenson, rack railway inventor John Blenkinsop, and Nicholas Wood who was to succeed him as &quot;Chief Viewer&quot; at Killingworth.

In 1814 George Stephenson, enginewright at the colliery, built his first locomotive &quot;Blücher&quot; with the help and encouragement of his manager, Nicholas Wood, in the colliery workshop behind his house &#x27;Dial Cottage&#x27; on Lime Road. This locomotive could haul of coal up a hill at . It was used to tow coal wagons along the wagonway from Killingworth to the Wallsend coal staithes. Although Blücher did not survive long, it provided Stephenson with the knowledge and experience to build better locomotives for use both at Killingworth and elsewhere. Later he would build the famous &quot;Rocket&quot; in his locomotive works in Newcastle.

At the same time Stephenson was developing his own version of the miner&#x27;s safety lamp, which he demonstrated underground in Killingworth pit a month before Sir Humphry Davy presented his design to the Royal Society in London in 1815. Known as the Geordie lamp it was to be widely used in the North-east in place of the Davy lamp.

The track gauge of the Killingworth tramway was .
Other names were Killingworth Colliery railway, Killingworth Railway and Killingworth wagonway
== Housing ==

=== The Garth Estates ===

Killingworth originally consisted of local authority houses. The first houses at Angus Close, owned by the local authority, were built to house key workers for the British Gas Research Centre. The rest of Killingworth&#x27;s estates were cul-de-sacs named &quot;Garths&quot; – all numbered, although Garths 1–3 never existed. The numbering was: 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, etc. In the 1990s the Garths located in West Bailey changed their names to street names with estates adopting patterns such as trees (Laburnum Court, Willow Gardens), birds (Dove Close, Chaffinch Way), Farne Islands (Crumstone Court, Longstone, Megstone), etc.

The houses in most of the Garths in West Bailey (the west of Killingworth) were built of concrete and had flat roofs, but around 1995 the Local Housing Association modernised these houses by adding pitched roofs. They renewed fencing, built new brick sheds and relocated roads and pathways.

The lowest remaining numbered Garth is Garth Four in West Bailey and the highest is Garth Thirty-Three in East Bailey aka Hadrian court. The housing estate formally known as Garth 21 was built as a private estate with detached and semi-detached 3 and 4 bed room homes.

Many Local Authority Homes were purchased by the tenants, some of whom still reside in the houses that were built in the 1960s.

=== Private Estates ===

In the early 1970s, construction started on two new private estates. One north of East Bailey built by Fisher, called Longmeadows with streets named after the Farne Islands (Knivestone, Goldstone, Crumstone etc.), and the other, on the North side of West Bailey. This estate, called Highfields, was constructed by Greensit &amp; Barrett with its streets named after notable battles Flodden, Agincourt, Stamford, Culloden and Sedgemoor.

== The Towers ==

The most eye-catching and radical aspect of the township was the 3-tier housing estate called Killingworth Towers – apartment blocks built in the early 1970s. Tenanted by the local authority, they were made of dark grey concrete blocks and were named &quot;Bamburgh&quot;, &quot;Kielder&quot; and &quot;Ford&quot; Tower etc., after castles. They consisted of a combination of 1, 2 and 3 storey homes built on top of each other rising to 10 storeys in some towers, with tremendous views.

The estate was originally designed to mimic a medieval castle with an outer wall and inner keep connected to lifts and rubbish chutes by ramps and a two-tier walkway (see gallery). This design could be seen on maps of the Towers imprinted on the cast-iron drain covers within the estate. The walkways all led to a elevated walkway leading straight through the mostly covered Killingworth Citadel Shopping Centre. This communal configuration was experimental and somewhat typical of the time.

=== Decline ===

The concept was to create community interaction, with large parks in the grasslands around the towers and adult social clubs. The design did not live up to expectations and the estate started to look and feel like a prison rather than a castle with the introduction of measures to stop anti-social behaviour from youths congregating within the tower instead of in the parks.

Grating was retrofitted to prevent risk takers sliding down the high girders holding up the walkways. Cast iron grilles were erected to stop transit by over-exuberant youths racing bikes and skateboards along the smooth walkway &quot;racetrack&quot;. Dogs fouled the walkways, rubbish chutes were blocked, vandals damaged communal bins, stairwells, lifts and multi-storey residential car parks joined the list of problems. The Towers were never widely popular and were demolished in 1987.

The last remaining structure, the walkway to the shops, was eventually demolished as it served no purpose after the Towers&#x27; demise, but it stood alone for 10 years until funds were found to bring it down.

The land is now occupied by two new estates of privately owned homes built by Cussins Homes and Barratt Homes.

== Town centre ==

The original town centre was built in the 1960s. The boxer Henry Cooper declared the shopping centre open while standing on the steps of the Puffing Billy pub. The centre included a large department store, Woolco that sold groceries and car parts and even incorporated a tyre service bay.

=== History of commerce ===
The first two shops in Killingworth in the 1960s were &quot;Moore&#x27;s&quot; and a small confectionery shop, situated between Garth Six and Angus Close and adjacent to the West House pub, but these shops were demolished in the 1970s.
The shopping centre included Dewhurst butchers, Greggs bakery and newsagents, but it was demolished in the 1990s. The Puffing Billy Pub was built on a bridge over the road.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Morrisons shopping complex (containing Morrisons supermarket) became the commercial centre, while the former Woolco site stood as wasteland for more than a decade. In the early 2000s, Killingworth Centre, a modern shopping mall, was built there. Morrisons moved into a new purpose-built store. The premises vacated by Morrisons are now occupied by Matalan and Home Bargains.

In 2010, a new KFC and public house (&#x27;The Shire Horse&#x27;) were constructed next to McDonald&#x27;s in Killingworth Centre.

=== White Swan Centre ===
The White Swan was a large white building in the town centre. It was originally owned by Merz &amp; McLellan and built in the 1960s. It contains of office space and employed 600 professional and clerical people. It was constructed by Northumberland County Council, and the building towered over Killingworth.

Over the years, the office space became vacant and, like the former Woolco site, was disused through the 1990s. The building was reduced in height, remodernised, reopened and renamed White Swan Centre. The name White Swan was chosen from suggestions provided by local school children and reflects the swans found on the local lake. The White Swan Centre was built to house local services previously provided in demolished buildings that had been attached to the high-level shopping precinct. For example, a doctors&#x27; surgery and library and a small gym was housed in the White Swan centre as the swimming pool and sports centre had also been demolished. The new Lakeside swimming pool and sports centre was built alongside the lake next to George Stephenson High School.

== Transport ==

Killingworth lies within the remit of the North East Joint Transport Committee and the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive (Nexus).

Killingworth Bus Station is located adjacent to the Killingworth Centre. It is served by Arriva North East, Go North East, and Stagecoach North East with routes to Newcastle upon Tyne, North Tyneside and Northumberland.

== Schools ==

Killingworth is home to Bailey Green, Grasmere Academy and Amberley primary schools and George Stephenson High School. In recent years Killingworth moved from a three-tier education system consisting of, First, Middle and High schools, to a two-tier system.

<doc id="498649" wikidata="Q249992" url="?curid=498649" title="Lake Hévíz">
<text>Lake Hévíz is located in Hévíz, Hungary, near the western end of Lake Balaton, from Keszthely.

It is the largest swimmable thermal lake in the world ( in area), and is the second largest thermal lake in general, second to only the Frying Pan Lake in New Zealand, which is too hot for swimming. The flow of water is very strong and the water in the lake is completely replenished every 72 hours. Its minimum depth is 2 meters, reaching a maximum depth of 38 meters, exactly at the point where the hot thermal water comes out to the surface.

== Microscopic organisms of the lake ==
The fauna and flora are unique in Lake Hévíz due to the temperature and chemical composition of the water, which contains carbonic acid, calcium, magnesium, hydrogen carbonate, reduced sulfuric compounds as well as oxygen in solution. Several species so far can be found only in this lake.

Bacteria is the dominant life form in the lake; it is possible that this is a cause of the curative effect. Several taxa can be found here. Most common Cyanobacteria are filamentous blue-green algae (&quot;Oscillatoria princeps&quot;, &quot;O. tenuis&quot;, &quot;O. jasoruensis&quot;, &quot;O. chlorina&quot;, &quot;Spirulina major&quot;). Half of the blue species are thermophile, stenoterm ones. There are two thermophile blue green alga species (&quot;Pseudanabaena papillaterminata&quot;, &quot;Pseudanabaena crassa&quot;) of which Lake Hévíz is the only Hungarian habitat.

Bacterial tektons are typical of the lake. The crater is covered mostly by &quot;Thiothrix&quot; sp. and &quot;Beggiatoa&quot; sp. from a depth of 1.5 m to the opening of the springcave. These together with the bacterium species play an important role in the lake&#x27;s sulfur cycle.

Actinomycetes (&quot;Streptomyces&quot; sp., &quot;Micromonospora&quot; sp.) are also worth mentioning. &quot;Micromonospora heviziensis&quot; for instance, a very powerful protein and cellulose decomposer, can only be found here in the world. Microbispora amethystogenes on the other hand, which accumulates iodine in its cells, is to be found in only few lakes in the world. Unfortunately this latter species has not been found in the lake since the 1980s as a result of excessive mining.
Changing environment affected other bacteria as well. &quot;Micromonospora carbonacea&quot; and &quot;M. chalcea&quot; was not detected in the 1990s. Actinomycetes communities have become dominated by &quot;Micromonospora purpureochromogenes&quot;, while &quot;M. heviziensis&quot; was suppressed. Antibiotics secreting &quot;Streptomyces&quot; are likely to be found.

Green algae – especially &quot;Chlorella&quot; sp. – are present all over the lake except for the springcave and its surroundings. &quot;Navicula cryptocephala&quot; and &quot;Navicula capitatoradiata &quot;are common diatoms in the lake. The biodiversity of the phytoplankton is poor and its biomass is low, thus the lake&#x27;s trophic level ranges from oligotrophic to mesotrophic.

There are two new species of Nematoda: &quot;Crocodolrylaimus thermalis&quot; and &quot;Neoactinolaimus tepidus&quot;. There can be found real rarities among Rotatorias as well (&quot;Epiphanes brachionus&quot; var. &quot;Spinosus&quot;, &quot;Lecane inermis&quot;), which are only present in warm waters. Jenő Ponyi has described the lake&#x27;s primitive crustaceans in detail. Also a unique &quot;Hydracarina acarus&quot; is said to have found its habitat outside the fence surrounding the lake.

==Medicinal properties==
The waters are reported to be beneficial to patients with rheumatic diseases and locomotor disorders, among others. There is a thriving health tourism industry in the area.

<doc id="498652" wikidata="Q878374" url="?curid=498652" title="Robert F. Stockton">
<text>Robert Field Stockton (August 20, 1795 – October 7, 1866) was a United States Navy commodore, notable in the capture of California during the Mexican–American War. He was a naval innovator and an early advocate for a propeller-driven, steam-powered navy. Stockton was from a notable political family and also served as a U.S. senator from New Jersey.

==Biography==

Robert F. Stockton was born at Morven, Stockton Street, Princeton, New Jersey, into a political family; his father Richard Stockton was a U.S. senator and representative, and his grandfather, Judge Richard Stockton, was attorney general for New Jersey and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Robert F. Stockton was of English descent, and his family had been in what is now the United States since the early colonial period. On March 4, 1823, he married Harriet Maria Potter in Charleston, South Carolina. Ten children were born to this marriage.

===Early naval service===
Stockton was appointed a midshipman in the U.S. Navy in September 1811, shortly after his 16th birthday, and served at sea and ashore during the War of 1812. After that conflict, Lieutenant Stockton was assigned to ships operating in the Mediterranean, in the Caribbean and off the coast of West Africa. He was the first naval officer to act against the slave trade and captured several slave ships. In December 1821, while commanding the U.S.S. &quot;Alligator&quot; along the African Windward Coast, Lt. Stockton, along with Dr. Eli Ayers of the American Colonization Society, negotiated a treaty that led to the founding of the state of Liberia. One source said that Stockton &quot;leveled a pistol at King Peter&#x27;s head and thereby convinced the latter to sell some of his territory&quot;. Another source states that, before Stockton leveled his pistol at King Peter, he handed another pistol to Ayers, directing him to shoot a mixed race slave trader who was warning King Peter that the Americans sought to end the slave trade from which King Peter&#x27;s tribe profited.

===Business affairs===
During the later 1820s and into the 1830s, Stockton primarily devoted his attention to business affairs in New Jersey. In addition, Stockton owned and operated the Tellurium gold mine in Goochland and Fluvanna counties in Virginia. He had purchased it in 1848, after its discovery in 1832. His son John P. Stockton was born during this period. He later followed his father into politics and was elected as a U.S. senator representing New Jersey.

In 1835, Stockton purchased a property in Monmouth County, New Jersey, called &quot;Sea Girt&quot;. The property was purchased in 1875 by a group of land developers, with the name of Stockton&#x27;s estate ultimately leading to the choice of the name Sea Girt, New Jersey, when the borough was established in 1918.

===Resumes active naval service===
In 1838, Stockton resumed active naval service as a captain. He served in the European area but took leave in 1840 to undertake political work. Offered the post of U.S. Secretary of the Navy by President John Tyler in 1841, he declined the offer but worked successfully to gain support for the construction of an advanced steam warship with a battery of very heavy guns.

This ship became , the Navy&#x27;s first screw-propelled steamer. The ship was designed by John Ericsson. Stockton commanded her when she was completed in 1843. The ship was armed with two long 225-pounder wrought iron guns, called the &quot;&quot;Peacemaker&quot; and the &quot;Oregon&quot;&quot;. Although he was the deviser of the defective gun, Captain Stockton&#x27;s political influence allowed him to be absolved of all responsibility for the February 1844 explosion of the gun, the &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, on board the ship. The explosion killed two cabinet secretaries and several others.

Cleared by the court of any wrongdoing in the explosion incident, Stockton was sent by President James K. Polk to Texas. Stockton carried with him Polk&#x27;s offer to annex Texas, sailing on the &quot;Princeton&quot; and arriving in Galveston. Stockton&#x27;s observations while in Texas made him aware of the looming war with Mexico, a fact he communicated directly to Polk once he arrived back in Washington. No vessel during the Mexican war was more useful than the &quot;Princeton&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico. The records of the Navy Department showed she performed more service than all the rest of the Gulf squadron put together. 

===Mexican–American War===
Conquest of California

On July 23, 1846, Commodore Stockton arrived in Monterey, California, and took over command from the ailing Commodore John D. Sloat of the Pacific Squadron of U.S. naval forces in the Pacific Ocean. Commodore Sloat had previously raised the US flag, without resistance, at Monterey, but had no plan to conduct any further military operations on shore and once relieved, sailed home to the United States, leaving Commodore Stockton in command of all US forces. Stockton&#x27;s command ship was and his combined fleet of three frigates with about 480 men each, one ship of the line with about 780 men and up to four sloops with about 200 men each as well as three storeships made him the strongest force in California as well as the senior military commander and military governor. He was the main driving force in continuing to take possession of Alta California.

On August 11, 1846, Commodore Stockton marched on Pueblo de Los Angeles to meet in battle with General Castro&#x27;s army. Upon learning of the imminent arrival of Commodore Stockton, Castro retired, leaving behind all his artillery and made off in the direction of Sonora. Immediately after these events Stockton dispatched a courier, Kit Carson, to inform Washington of the proceedings and details of his conquest of California.

On December 6, 1846, Stockton learned that General Stephen Kearny had arrived in California with a small force and that he was besieged by vastly superior enemy forces at the Battle of San Pasqual. Kearny was among the wounded and in command of only 60 weary dragoons mounted on tired mules who were in a perilous position and under attack from a Californio-Mexican cavalry force under Andrés Pico. However, for Commodore Stockton&#x27;s immediate decision to take personal command of a relief column, the outcome could have been disastrous for Kearny.

Later, the combined forces consolidated control over San Diego, and in January 1847 won the minor skirmishes at the Battle of Rio San Gabriel and Battle of La Mesa taking back control of Los Angeles. Faced with the approximate 200 men under John C. Fremont&#x27;s California Battalion as well as Stockton and Kearny&#x27;s troops, the Californios sued for peace and signed the Treaty of Cahuenga, which ending fighting in Alta California. Stockton, as senior military authority and military governor of the occupied territory, authorized John C. Fremont&#x27;s appointment to succeed him as military governor and commander of the California Battalion militia force. When General Kearny finally arrived with orders to assume control of the temporary government Stockton turned over control to Kearny.

===Political pursuits===
Stockton resigned from the Navy in May 1850 and returned to business and political pursuits. In 1851, he was elected as a Democrat from New Jersey to the United States Senate, where he sponsored a bill to abolish flogging as a Navy punishment. He resigned on January 10, 1853, to serve as president of the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, a position he held until 1866.

He was a delegate to the unsuccessful Peace Conference of 1861 that attempted to settle the secession crisis; instead the American Civil War began later that year. In 1863, he was appointed to command the New Jersey militia when the Confederate Army invaded Pennsylvania. Stockton died at Princeton, New Jersey, in October 1866, and is buried in the Princeton Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Four U.S. Navy ships have been named in his honor. The cities of Stockton, California and Stockton, Missouri are named in his honor, as is the borough of Stockton, New Jersey, Stockton Street in San Francisco, and Fort Stockton, San Diego, California, which is now a ruin, but was occupied during the Mexican–American War. In Mariposa County, California Stockton Creek is named after him due to a mine he owned in the California Gold Rush. In Liberia, Stockton Creek, a tidal channel that connects the Mesurado River and the Saint Paul River, and that separates Bushrod Island from the mainland in Monrovia, is also named for him.

Formerly Commodore Stockton Elementary School in San Francisco between Clay and Pacific Streets was named after him.
Stockton Street in San Jose was named after him and his Garden Alameda San Jose neighborhood. In Sacramento, Stockton Boulevard is the historic thoroughfare linking Sacramento and Stockton, now superseded by Highway 99 and Interstate 5.

<text>Jørgen Alexander Knudtzon (9 September 1854 – 7 January 1917) was a Norwegian linguist and historian. He was a professor of Semitic Languages at the University of Oslo from 1907.

Knudtzon was born in Trondheim, the son of consul Hans Nicolay Knudtzon (1814–89) and his wife Catharina (1831–79) &quot;née&quot; Trampe. Having finished his secondary education in 1872, he enrolled at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania. After a short spell at the Cathedral School in Trondheim, he returned to Christiania to study Semitic languages, in particular Akkadian, Arabian and Hebrew, the last of which he also gave lectures on. His first scholarly contribution was &quot;Textkritische Bemerkungen zu Lay 17,18&quot;, which was published in 1882. In the same decade he studied assyriology and theology in Germany on a university stipend. He returned to Norway after only two years, and resumed his Hebrew teaching. In 1889, he took his dr. phil. degree with the thesis &quot;Det saakaldte Perfektum og Imperfektum i Hebraisk&quot; (&quot;The So-called Perfect and Preterite in Hebrew&quot;).

In recognizing the Hittite language as Indo-European on the basis of two letters from Arzawa (in Western Anatolia), found in Egypt (&quot;Die zwei Arzawa-Briefe&quot;, 1902), he played an important role in the deciphering of the Hittite language script. In two landmark volumes (1907 and 1915) he published the Amarna letters, diplomatic correspondence of the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, better known as Akhenaten (1351–1334 BC).

<doc id="498669" wikidata="Q1807901" url="?curid=498669" title="Redcap">
<text>The redcap (or powrie) is a type of malevolent, murderous goblin found in folklore of the Anglo-Scottish border region. The redcap is said to inhabit ruined castles along the Anglo-Scottish border, especially those that were the scenes of tyranny or wicked deeds, and is known for soaking his cap in the blood of his victims. He is also known as Redcomb and Bloody Cap.

==Description and behaviour==
Redcap is depicted as &quot;a short, thickset old elf with long prominent teeth, skinny fingers armed with talons like eagles, large eyes of a fiery red colour, grisly hair streaming down his shoulders, iron boots, a pikestaff in his left hand, and a red cap on his head&quot;. When travellers take refuge in his lair, he flings huge stones at them and if he kills them, he soaks his cap in their blood, giving it a crimson hue. He is unaffected by human strength, but can be driven away by words of Scripture or by the brandishing of a crucifix, which cause him to utter a dismal yell and vanish in flames, leaving behind a large tooth.

==Variants==
The tale of a redcap in Perthshire depicts him as a more benign little man living in a room high up in Grantully Castle. He bestows good fortune on those who see or hear him.

The Kabouter (Kaboutermannekins), or redcaps of Dutch folklore, are also very different and more akin to brownies.

The ruin of Blackett Tower, a border fortress that was owned by the Bell family in the parish of Kirkpatrick-Fleming in Dumfriesshire, was haunted by a more traditional ghost known as &quot;Old Red Cap&quot; or &quot;Bloody Bell&quot;. A description of the tower and ghost was given by William Scott Irving in the poem &quot;Fair Helen&quot; in which the &quot;ghastly phantom&quot; holds a bloody dagger beneath a red eastern moon.

The term redcap is also used in a more general sense. For example, in the village of Zennor in Cornwall fairies were often referred to as &quot;red-caps&quot; (including the more benevolent trooping fairies) because of their fondness for wearing green clothing and scarlet caps. This characteristic is demonstrated by an excerpt from the poem &quot;The Fairies&quot; by the Irish poet William Allingham: &quot;Wee folk, good folk/trooping all together/Green jacket, red cap/and white owl&#x27;s feather&quot;.

==Robin Redcap and William de Soulis==
Scots nobleman William de Soulis, was said in folklore to have a redcap familiar called &quot;Robin Redcap&quot;. This entity was said to have wrought much harm and ruin in the lands of his master&#x27;s dwelling, Hermitage Castle. Ultimately, William was (according to legend) taken to the Ninestane Rig, a stone circle near the castle, then wrapped in lead and boiled to death. In reality, William de Soulis was imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle and died there, following his confessed complicity in the conspiracy against Robert the Bruce in 1320.

Sir Walter Scott in &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot; (1802) records a ballad written by John Leyden entitled &quot;Lord Soulis&quot; in which Redcap has granted his master safety against weapons and lives in a chest secured by three strong padlocks. Scott states that the Redcap is a class of spirits that haunts old castles, and that every ruined tower in the south of Scotland was supposed to have one of these spirits residing within. Robin Redcap should not be confused with the mischievous hobgoblin known as Robin Roundcap of East Yorkshire folklore.

<doc id="498671" wikidata="Q343016" url="?curid=498671" title="Acrylate">
<text>Acrylates (IUPAC: prop-2-enoates) are the salts, esters, and conjugate bases of acrylic acid. The acrylate ion is the anion . Often, acrylate refers to esters of acrylic acid, the most common member being methyl acrylate. These acrylates contain vinyl groups. These compounds are of interest because they are bifunctional: the vinyl group is susceptible to polymerization and the carboxylate group carries myriad functionalities.

==Monomers==
Acrylates are defined by the formula , where R can be many groups:
* Acrylic acid
* Methyl acrylate
* Ethyl acrylate
* 2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether
* 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate
* Butyl acrylate
* Trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA)
The versatility of the resulting polymers is owed to the range of R groups.
===Acrylate derivatives===
Methacrylates ( ) and cyanoacrylates ( ,) are closely related to acrylates. The feature a methyl and a nitrile in place of the H alpha to the carboxy functional group. They share several properties, being polymerized by radicals and being colorless.

==Polymers==
Some acrylate polymers (poly(methyl methacrylate) etc. not included):
* Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA)
* Poly(ethyl acrylate) (PME) 
* Poly(butyl acrylate)
Acrylate monomers are used to form acrylate polymers. Most commonly, these polymers are in fact copolymers, being derived from two monomers.

===Related polymers===

In the same way that several variants of acrylic esters are known, so too are the corresponding polymers. Their properties strongly depends on the substituent.

A large family of acrylate-like polymers are derived from methyl methacrylate and many related esters, especially polymethyl methacrylate.

A second large family of acrylate-like polymers are derived from ethyl cyanoacrylate, which gives rise to cyanoacrylates.
Yet another family of acrylate-related polymers are the polyacrylamides, especially the parent derived from acrylamide.

==Other uses==
In addition to forming polymers, acrylate esters participate in other reactions relevant to organic chemistry. They are Michael acceptors and dienophiles. They undergo transesterification.

==Production==
Acrylates are industrially prepared by treating acrylic acid with the corresponding alcohol in presence of a catalyst. The reaction with lower alcohols (methanol, ethanol) takes place at 100–120 °C with acidic heterogeneous catalysts (cation exchanger). The reaction of higher alcohols (&quot;n&quot;-butanol, 2-ethylhexanol) is catalysed with sulfuric acid in homogeneous phase. Acrylates of even higher alcohols are obtainable by transesterification of lower esters catalysed by titanium alcoholates or organic tin compounds (e.g. dibutyltin dilaurate).

<text>Sigma Nu () is an undergraduate college fraternity founded at the Virginia Military Institute in 1869. Since its founding, Sigma Nu has chartered more than 279 chapters across the United States and Canada and has initiated more than 235,000 members. It is part of the Lexington Triad, a trio of national fraternities that were founded at colleges in Lexington, Virginia.

The fraternity&#x27;s values are summarized by the principles of love, honor, and truth. Because of its military heritage, Sigma Nu retains many military trappings in its chapter ranks and traditions, and places importance on the concept of personal honor. The fraternity&#x27;s mission statement is:
* To develop ethical leaders inspired by the principles of Love, Honor, and Truth.
* To foster the personal growth of each man&#x27;s mind, heart, and character.
* To perpetuate lifelong friendships and commitment to the Fraternity.

==History==

The fraternity was founded by James Frank Hopkins, Greenfield Quarles and James McIlvaine Riley shortly after Hopkins witnessed what he considered a hazing ritual by upperclassmen at the Virginia Military Institute.

James Frank Hopkins, Greenfield Quarles, and James McIlvaine Riley enrolled at the Virginia Military Institute in 1866. Hopkins entered the institute at the age of 21 and was, at the time, one of the oldest cadets entering the institute. Both Hopkins and Quarles had served in the American Civil War as Confederate soldiers.

At this time, many secret societies were being formed on the VMI campus. In Hopkins&#x27; third year at VMI, he joined the Masonic Lodge in Lexington. The masons inspired him to create a similar organization at VMI. Hopkins shared his ideas with Quarles and Riley, and in October 1868, the three came together on a limestone rock on the edge of the VMI parade ground to form the Legion of Honor. The three founders would go on to bring others into the Legion of Honor over the rest of the year. On January 1, 1869, the founders, along with the rest of the members of the Legion of Honor, held their first official meeting as Sigma Nu. The fraternity&#x27;s existence remained secret until the founders publicly announced their new society on January 1, 1869.

Hopkins designed the fraternity&#x27;s badge, which stands mostly unchanged from its original form. The badge was introduced in the spring of 1869. Early members, Edward Arthur and Linton Buck, both wrote the original Constitution and Law, respectively. Some conflict arose because Arthur had been a member of the Honduras Emigrant Society and had included some influences from that organization in the constitution. Buck felt these influences should be removed. His revision became the first Law of Sigma Nu. This first chapter of Sigma Nu chose as its motto &quot;nulli secundus&quot;, a Latin phrase meaning &quot;second to none.&quot;

There were many efforts in the beginning years to establish chapters at other schools. By 1883, &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; chartered eleven additional chapters, of which only three survived. One of the many factors was the anti-fraternity sentiment during this time. &quot;Kappa chapter&quot; was established in 1881 at North Georgia College &amp; State University, giving the fraternity an important member, John Alexander Howard. Howard suggested that the fraternity drop the use of Roman numerals for chapter designation in favor of using a Greek letter designation. He is also responsible for the creation of &quot;The Delta&quot;, Sigma Nu&#x27;s fraternity magazine which was first published in April 1883. The name &quot;The Delta&quot; originated from the location of the three active chapters of Sigma Nu forming a Delta.

Howard&#x27;s editorials in &quot;The Delta&quot; inspired Isaac P. Robison, founder of &quot;Lambda chapter&quot;, to propose a convention for the national fraternity. On July 10, 1884, Sigma Nu&#x27;s first convention was held in the Maxwell House Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee. The first national headquarters for the fraternity was established in Indianapolis in 1915. It relocated to Lexington, Virginia in 1958. Additional wings were added to the headquarters building in 1969 and 1994 for Sigma Nu&#x27;s 100th and 125th anniversaries.

In 1909, Sigma Nu was a founding member of the North American Interfraternity Conference.

==Symbols and traditions==
Sigma Nu&#x27;s colors are black, white, and gold. Its flower is the white rose, specifically the wild English &#x27;Floribunda. Its song is &quot;The White Star of Sigma Nu&quot;.

Its gold badge was designed by Hopkins, one of the fraternity&#x27;s founders. It has a round center with a golden coiled serpent on a black enamel background. From the center are five arms that feature a pair of crossed swords and a single letter on a background of white enamel; the letters collectively spell the Greek letters . Its pledge pin looks like the center of the member&#x27;s badge.

== Chapters ==
Sigma Nu has some 160 active chapters in colleges and universities throughout the United States and Canada.

==Membership==
Since the founding of Sigma Nu, it has initiated over 235,000 members.

== Activities ==
The fraternity sponsors various programming including ethical leadership development through its LEAD program and philanthropic events through its Helping Hand Initiative. It recruits new members using its Values Based Recruitment method.

===College of Chapters===
The Sigma Nu College of Chapters is a three-day training program held annually. College of Chapters is designed for collegiate chapter Commanders, and the program emphasizes chapter management, leadership, core competencies, and networking. The curriculum focuses on best practices and is presented by fraternity staff, alumni volunteers, and advisers.

===LEAD===
The LEAD (Leadership, Ethics, Achievement, Development) Program is designed to be a four-year educational and development curriculum for its collegiate members. In 1988, Sigma Nu created the LEAD Program. Since its launch in 1988 the Program has been updated twice, once in 1997 and again in 2008. The 2008 updates included the online version of the LEAD Program that currently exists today. The program trains candidates in general life skills, with an emphasis on alcohol use disorder awareness.

=== Awards ===
Sigma Nu has several awards that are presented to chapters. The Rock Chapter Award is the highest award a Sigma Nu chapter can receive. The LEAD Chapter of the Year award is for the LEAD program. The Gallaher Cup is awarded to the chapter with the highest GPA.

Following is a list of chapters that have Sigma Nu Awards.
==Philanthropy==
In 1945, William Yates (University of Pennsylvania) inspired the formation of the &quot;Sigma Nu Inc., Educational Foundation&quot;. Its name was changed to the &quot;Sigma Nu Educational Foundation, Inc.&quot; The foundation assists collegiate members with financial aid supplements, and the fraternity in the development of a leadership program.

== Governance structure ==

===Grand Chapter===
The Grand Chapter of Sigma Nu is a four-day legislative convention where representatives of the fraternity&#x27;s collegiate and alumni chapters and grand officers meet to determine new legislation and operational direction of the Fraternity for the next . The Grand Chapter meets every two years. The Grand Chapter body is composed of two voting representatives from each collegiate chapter of Sigma Nu Fraternity. Laws are discussed and voted on by the collegiate representatives in &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; style business meeting conducted by the national regent of the fraternity.

=== The Law ===
The Law is a three-part document, including the fraternity&#x27;s constitution, statutes, and trial code. It sets membership requirements, standards of conduct, and the framework for the operation of all entities of the fraternity, including collegiate chapters. The Law is designed to allow for autonomy and self-governance in collegiate chapters. It may be amended by the Grand Chapter to accommodate changing needs of Sigma Nu&#x27;s membership. The first edition of the Law was formally adopted at Sigma Nu&#x27;s first convention in 1884.

===High Council===
The High Council serves as the board of directors of Sigma Nu Fraternity, Inc. and is elected by the Grand Chapter. It serves as the governing arm of the general fraternity during the period between Grand Chapters. Governance of the High Council is relegated to those duties especially prescribed by The Law. In cases where The Law prescribes no special duty, the High Council shall act on those situations through interpretation of The Law. There are five roles on the High Council: the regent, who acts as the national president and chairman of the board of Sigma Nu for a term of two years; the regent-elect, the grand treasurer; the vice-regents, appointed members of the board; and the collegiate grand councilmen, who serve as collegiate representatives to the High Council.

== Scandals and controversies ==

* The fraternity began debating allowing non-white and Jewish members shortly after the Supreme Court of the United States desegregated schools in 1954. In 1964, following a failed civil rights amendment to the Sigma Nu&#x27;s constitution, the &quot;Dartmouth College chapter&quot; seceded from the fraternity in protest. The organization did not allow non-white members until the late 1960s. The &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; rejoined in 1983.
* Actor Jon Hamm, a member of the &quot;Upsilon chapter&quot;, was arrested for participating in a violent hazing in November 1990 during which pledge Mark Sanders was beaten with a paddle and a broom, led by Hamm around the fraternity house with the claw of a hammer beneath his genitals, and had his clothes set on fire. The chapter closed and Hamm completed the terms of a deferred adjudication; his charges were dismissed in 1995.
* In 2004, nine members at Fresno State University were arrested for kidnapping after playing a prank on their vice president. Other students witnessed the prank and called the police because they thought it was a real abduction.
* In 2010, a fraternity member at Arizona State University stabbed a fellow member when he tried to throw him into a pool.
* Sigma Nu suspended all chapter events at University of North Carolina Wilmington after a fight broke out at a party it hosted in February 2014, resulting in an East Carolina University student driving with a US Marine on his hood. The driver hit a tree, killing the Marine, and was arrested for DWI and felony death by vehicle.
*In May 2014, the fraternity at Emory University was suspended five years following a hazing investigation.
*Also in 2015, Sigma Nu suspended its chapter at Old Dominion University pending an investigation after they placed banners with slogans like &quot;Rowdy and Fun, Hope Your Baby Girl is Ready for a Good Time...&quot; and the story went viral.
*In February 2016, the fraternity at University of North Georgia was suspended due to hazing and alcohol violations.
* In August 2016, a Sigma Nu member at Texas A&amp;M University died of an illegal drug overdose in the fraternity house. Six members were arrested for possession and distribution of illegal drugs on campus such as cocaine, meth, LSD, MDMA, marijuana, heroin, and ecstasy. In October 2017, the deceased member&#x27;s father, Eugene Gridnev, instituted a wrongful death suit against the fraternity itself, as well as several of the members present during his son&#x27;s death. The lawsuit was settled out-of-court.
*In October 2016, the fraternity at College of Charleston was suspended for drug, alcohol, and hazing violations. Sigma Nu was the third fraternity on campus to get suspended that year.
* Also in October 2016, Sigma Nu suspended its chapter at University of Nevada, Reno when a freshman pledge fell down the stairs and died after a night of excessive drinking in the fraternity house.
*In October 2017, the fraternity at Indiana University Bloomington was suspended for alcohol and hazing violations. The fraternity was placed on probation by the university a few months prior to the suspension.
*In May 2018, the fraternity at Cornell University was suspended for three years due to hazing allegations reported to the university. According to university reports, their pledges were blindfolded, dropped off in a wooded area, pressured to excessively drink alcohol, hosed down while in their underwear, and was subject to inappropriate gesturing, physical exercise and homophobic slurs.
*In December 2019, the fraternity at University of Central Florida was suspended for violating the university&#x27;s code of conduct. A pledge was blindfolded and pressured to consume cocaine. He was also required to stay in the fraternity house for a week before being initiated. The fraternity was already under investigation for threatening to beat up a man after he confronted them for randomly throwing drinks on him and others at a local bar.
* In October 2021, the fraternity at University of Southern California was suspended following allegations of sexual assault against at least seven women.
*In 2021, the fraternity at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) was suspended after a second-year fraternity member died on an unsanctioned fraternity trip. In September 2022, the fraternity chapter at UCSB closed down following financial delinquency, alcohol violations, and dishonesty with the university and national organization.

<doc id="498674" wikidata="Q416002" url="?curid=498674" title="Polyacrylamide">
<text>Polyacrylamide (abbreviated as PAM or pAAM) is a polymer with the formula (-CH2CHCONH2-). It has a linear-chain structure. PAM is highly water-absorbent, forming a soft gel when hydrated. In 2008, an estimated 750,000,000 kg were produced, mainly for water treatment and the paper and mineral industries.

== Physicochemical properties ==
Polyacrylamide is a polyolefin. It can be viewed as polyethylene with amide substituents on alternating carbons. Unlike various nylons, polyacrylamide is not a polyamide because the amide groups are not in the polymer backbone. Owing to the presence of the amide (CONH2) groups, alternating carbon atoms in the backbone are stereogenic (colloquially: chiral). For this reason, polyacrylamide exists in atactic, syndiotactic, and isotactic forms, although this aspect is rarely discussed. The polymerization is initiated with radicals and is assumed to be stereorandom.

===Copolymers and modified polymers===
Linear polyacrylamide is a water-soluble polymer. Other polar solvents include DMSO and various alcohols. Cross-linking can be introduced using N,N-methylenebisacrylamide. Some crosslinked materials are swellable but not soluble, i.e., they are hydrogels.

Partial hydrolysis occurs at elevated temperatures in aqueous media, converting some amide substituents to carboxylates. This hydrolysis thus makes the polymer particularly hydrophilic. The polymer produced from N,N-dimethylacrylamide resists hydrolysis.

Copolymers of acrylamide include those derived from acrylic acid.

==Uses==

In the 1970s and 1980s, the proportionately largest use of these polymers was in water treatment. The next major application by weight is additives for pulp processing and papermaking. About 30% of polyacrylamide is used in the oil and mineral industries.

===Flocculation===
One of the largest uses for polyacrylamide is to flocculate solids in a liquid. This process applies to water treatment, and processes like paper making and screen printing. Polyacrylamide can be supplied in a powder or liquid form, with the liquid form being subcategorized as solution and emulsion polymer.

Even though these products are often called &#x27;polyacrylamide&#x27;, many are actually copolymers of acrylamide and one or more other species, such as an acrylic acid or a salt thereof. These copolymers have modified wetting and swellability.

The ionic forms of polyacrylamide has found an important role in the potable water treatment industry. Trivalent metal salts, like ferric chloride and aluminum chloride, are bridged by the long polymer chains of polyacrylamide. This results in significant enhancement of the flocculation rate. This allows water treatment plants to greatly improve the removal of total organic content (TOC) from raw water.

=== Fossil fuel industry ===

In the oil and gas industry, polyacrylamide derivatives (especially co-polymers) have a substantial effect on production by enhanced oil recovery by viscosity enhancement. High viscosity aqueous solutions can be generated with low concentrations of polyacrylamide polymers, which are injected to improve the economics of conventional water-flooding. In a separate application, hydraulic fracturing benefits from drag reduction resulting from injection of these solutions. These applications use large volumes of polymer solutions at concentration of 30–3000 mg/L.

===Soil conditioning===

The primary functions of polyacrylamide soil conditioners are to increase soil tilth, aeration, and porosity and reduce compaction, dustiness and water run-off. Typical applications are 10 mg/L, which is still expensive for many applications. Secondary functions are to increase plant vigor, color, appearance, rooting depth, and emergence of seeds while decreasing water requirements, diseases, erosion and maintenance expenses. FC 2712 is used for this purpose.

===Molecular biology laboratories===
Polyacrylamide is also often used in molecular biology applications as a medium for electrophoresis of proteins and nucleic acids in a technique known as PAGE. PAGE was first used in a laboratory setting in the early 1950s. In 1959, the groups of Davis and Ornstein and of Raymond and Weintraub independently published on the use of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate charged molecules. The technique is widely accepted today, and remains a common protocol in molecular biology labs.

Acrylamide has other uses in molecular biology laboratories, including the use of linear polyacrylamide (LPA) as a carrier, which aids in the precipitation of small amounts of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Many laboratory supply companies sell LPA for this use. In addition, under certain conditions, it can be used to selectively precipitate only RNA species from a mixture of nucleic acids.

=== Mechanobiology ===
The elastic modulus of polyacrylamide can be changed by varying the ratio of monomer to cross-linker during the fabrication of polyacrylamide gel. This property makes polyacrylamide useful in the field of mechanobiology, as a number of cells respond to mechanical stimuli.

===Niche uses===
The polymer is also used to make Gro-Beast toys, which expand when placed in water, such as the Test Tube Aliens. Similarly, the absorbent properties of one of its copolymers can be utilized as an additive in body-powder.

It has been used in Botox as a subdermal filler for aesthetic facial surgery (see Aquamid).

It was also used in the synthesis of the first Boger fluid.

==Environmental effects==
Considering the volume of polyacrylamide produced, these materials have been heavily scrutinized with regards to environmental and health impacts.

Polyacrylamide is of low toxicity but its precursor acrylamide is a neurotoxin and carcinogen. Thus, concerns naturally center on the possibility that polyacrylamide is contaminated with acrylamide. Considerable effort is made to scavenge traces of acrylamide from the polymer intended for use near food.

Additionally, there are concerns that polyacrylamide may de-polymerise to form acrylamide. Under conditions typical for cooking, polyacrylamide does not de-polymerise significantly. The single claim that polyacrylamide reverts to acrylamide has been widely challenged.

Polyacrylamide is most commonly partially biodegraded by the action of amidases, producing ammonia and polyacrylates. Polyacrylates are hard to biodegrade, but some soil microbe cultures have been shown to do so in aerobic conditions.

<text>Pavel Nikolayevich Yablochkov (also transliterated as Jablochkoff; ; – ) was a Russian electrical engineer, businessman and the inventor of the Yablochkov candle, a type of electric carbon arc lamp.

==Biography==
Yablochkov graduated in 1866 as a military engineer from Nikolayev Engineering Institute, now Military Engineering-Technical University (Russian Военный инженерно-технический университет), and in 1869 from Technical Galvanic School in Saint Petersburg. After serving in the army, Yablochkov settled in Moscow in 1873, where he was appointed Head of Telegraph Office at the Moscow-Kursk railroad. He opened up a workshop for his experiments in electrical engineering, which laid down the foundations for his future inventions in the field of electric lighting, electric machines, galvanic cells and accumulators.
Yablochkov’s major invention was the first model of an arc lamp that eliminated the mechanical complexity of competing lights that required a regulator to manage the voltaic arc. He went to Paris the same year where he built an industrial sample of the &quot;electric candle&quot; (French patent № 112024, 1876). It was in Paris that he developed his arc light idea into a complete system of electric lighting powered by Zénobe Gramme direct current dynamos fitted with an inverter to supply single-phase alternating current. The first public use of the Yablochkov system was in October 1877 at Halle Marengo of the Magasins du Louvre which was lit by six Yablochkov candles. By 1880, the system had grown in size to 120 lamps with 84 lit at a time powered by a 100-horsepower steam engine and had been operating every night for two and one half years.

The Paris Exposition of 1878 presented Yablochkov with the unique opportunity to make a spectacular demonstration for a world audience, and through the promotional efforts of Gramme was successful in having 64 of his arc lights installed along the half mile (0.8 km) length of Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra, Place du Théâtre Français (today Place André-Malraux) and around the Place de l&#x27;Opéra. It was first lit in February 1878. Yablochkov candles required high voltage, and it was not long before experimenters reported that the arc lights could be powered on a 7-mile (11 km) circuit. Yablochkov candles were superior to Lontin-Serrin regulator arc lights that each required a separate Gramme generator. Beginning in 1880, the Paris Hippodrome&#x27;s 20 Serrin lights powered by 20 generators were replaced by 68 additional Yablochkov candles, based on two years of positive experience with 60 candles powered by just three generators. The impact of the 1878 Paris demonstration was a depression in the value of gas company shares which did not recover until 1880. French, English, and American businessmen quickly set up companies licensing Yablochkov&#x27;s patents.

As part of his arc lighting patents, Yablochkov described a method of employing Michael Faraday&#x27;s discovery of induction to create a continuous current of higher voltage, where primary windings were connected to a source of alternating current and secondary windings could be connected to several electric &quot;candles&quot;. Although it was not recognized at the time, Yablochkov&#x27;s idea of using transformers to provide different voltages from the same AC line was the model that modern transmission and distribution systems would settle on. As the patent said such a system &quot;allowed to provide separate supply to several lighting fixtures with different luminous intensities from a single source of electric power&quot;. 
In 1879, Yablochkov established “Electric Lighting Company, P.N. Yablochkov the Inventor and Co” and an electrical plant in Petersburg that would later produce illuminators for military vessels and factories. There was considerable international competition to his arc lights. His lasted only one and a half hours whereas those of Charles F. Brush lasted twice as long.

From the mid-1880s, Yablochkov mostly occupied himself with problems of generating electric energy. He constructed the so-called “magnet dynamo electric machine”, which had most of the features of the modern inductor. Yablochkov did extensive research on transformation of fuel energy into electric energy, suggested a galvanic cell with alkaline electrolyte, and created a regenerative cell (the so-called autoaccumulator).

Yablochkov participated in Electrical engineering exhibitions in Russia (1880 and 1882), Paris (1881 and 1889), and First International Congress of Electricians (1881). For participation in the exhibition and congress, he was awarded the French Order of the Legion of Honor.

==Personal life==
Yablochkov was an active Freemason. He was initiated in 1876 into the Supreme Council of France of the Scottish Rite. After being &quot;Worshipful Master&quot; of three lodges in Paris, he created a new lodge under the Supreme Council known as &quot;Cosmos&quot; in 25 June 1887. Through this he hoped to attract young and wealthy Russian emigrants in Paris. One member of his lodge was Maksim Kovalevsky, who would later help bring Freemasonry back to Russia and prepare the groundwork for the foundation of the Grand Orient of Russia&#x27;s Peoples.

==Legacy==
In 1947, the USSR introduced the Yablochkov Award for the best work in the field of electrical engineering.

The crater Yablochkov on the Moon is named after him.

<text>The Sri Lanka frogmouth, Sri Lankan frogmouth or Ceylon frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger) is a small frogmouth found in the Western Ghats of south India and Sri Lanka. Related to the nightjars, it is nocturnal and is found in forest habitats. The plumage coloration resembles that of dried leaves and the bird roosts quietly on branches, making it difficult to see. Each has a favourite roost that it uses regularly unless disturbed. It has a distinctive call that is usually heard at dawn and dusk. The sexes differ slightly in plumage.

==Description==

This bird reaches in length. Like all frogmouths, this species has a wide and hooked bill with slit-like nostrils and the large head with eyes facing forward to provide a wide field of binocular vision. Compared to others of its genus it has small wings, which are distinguished by the wing coverts ending in black spots tipped with white. The male is gray-brown with fine barring and a spotted crown. Some males are browner and look more similar to females. The female is more rufous or chestnut brown. Indian female birds have very fine black speckles on the crown but Sri Lankan females may lack or may have reduced markings. The bird also has short, stiff bristles in front of and surrounding the eyes. The Western Ghats population, ssp. &quot;roonwali&quot; (named after Mithan Lal Roonwal), looks very slightly different. The male has a brownish-gray wing mirror and yellowish spots on the undersides, compared to gray or white in the nominate Sri Lankan form. The female has a bright reddish-brown wing mirror and the wings are unspotted below.

==Habitat and distribution==
This species is found in the Western Ghats of southwest India and Sri Lanka. Its habitat is tropical forest, usually with dense undergrowth. It can sometimes be found in more disturbed habitats, including plantations. Its presence may be overlooked due to its nocturnal behaviour and camouflage.

==Behaviour==

This frogmouth is rarely seen during the day except at roost sites or when flushed. It regularly uses the same roost spot for months. When alarmed at its perch, it slowly moves its head, pointing its bill upward, and it can easily be mistaken for a jagged, broken branch. It relies on this crypsis and will often sit still a long time before making an escape. It may open its mouth wide in a threat display. Like its congeners, it feeds on insects, catching them in flight or gleaning them from the ground or tree branches. It is sometimes mobbed at its day roost by small songbirds. It is vocal at dusk, the call of the female being a loud, screechy &quot;shkeerauuw&quot; which drops in volume and ends is a series of hiccups. Another call is a series of rapid &quot;skwar-skwar-skwar&quot; which is produced by both male and female.

The breeding season in southern India is January to April, and in Sri Lanka February to March. The nest is a small pad made of moss lined with down and covered on the outside with lichens and bark. The bird incubates a single white egg, covering the nest and holding the tail flush with the tree, taking on the outline of a lichen-covered snag. The male often broods during the day, while both parents share the duty during the night. After the chick fledges, the male destroys the nest. The parents often use the same branch for multiple nestings. The juvenile may stay with the parents for a couple of months, huddling between them at the roost.

<doc id="498684" wikidata="Q2171667" url="?curid=498684" title="Interstate 244">
<text>Interstate 244 (I-244), also known as the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway (in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.) since 1984, the Crosstown Expressway, and the Red Fork Expressway, is a east–west Interstate Highway bypass route of I-44 around Tulsa, Oklahoma.

At both I-244&#x27;s western and eastern terminus, the highway connects with I-44. I-244 runs from the western bank of the Arkansas River, across the river and past downtown Tulsa, before running through the northern half of the city and connecting again with I-44.

In downtown Tulsa, I-244 forms the northern and western legs of the &quot;Inner Dispersal Loop&quot;. The southern and eastern legs are formed by the unsigned I-444 (signed as U.S. Highway 75 (US-75)).

==Route description==
I-244 begins at a stack interchange with I-44 (which is concurrent with State Highway 66 (SH-66) at this point). I-244 continues northeast from here, running parallel to Southwest Boulevard. Two interchanges provide access to 33rd West Avenue, 40th Place, and Southwest Boulevard. US-75 northbound then merges into I-244 eastbound at exit 2, forming a concurrency with the Interstate; US-75 south of here is a freeway headed south toward Glenpool and Okmulgee. The next three interchanges only provide partial access to the roads they link to. Exit 3A, which lacks a westbound exit ramp, provides access to Southwest Boulevard; exit 3B to 21st Street and Union Avenue and exit 4A to 17th Street and Southwest Boulevard provide only a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. North of exit 4A, I-244 and US-75 cross the Arkansas River.

Exit 4B marks I-244&#x27;s entry into the Inner Dispersal Loop (IDL), a ring of freeways encircling Downtown Tulsa. At exit 4B, the southwest corner of the loop, US-75 splits away from I-244, joining I-444, which begins at this interchange and proceeds along the south and east edges of the loop. US-64 and SH-51 westbound join I-244 at this interchange, continuing along the westside of the loop with the Interstate. Two partial interchanges, exits 4C and 5A, provide access to Downtown Tulsa streets. I-244 then reaches the northwest corner of the IDL. At this point lies an interchange with two other freeways. US-64 and SH-51 split away from I-444 here to join westbound US-412, forming the Keystone Expressway. The L.L. Tisdale Parkway continues north from here. I-244 turns east from here, following the north leg of the IDL, joined by US-412 eastbound, which will overlap I-244 for the remainder of the highway. Three more exits to downtown streets are along this leg of the loop. At the northeast corner of the loop, I-244 junctions with I-444, which ends at this interchange, and US-75, which continues north toward Bartlesville. I-244 and US-412 exit the loop on an easterly course.

East of the IDL, I-244 and US-412 run generally parallel to Admiral Place. This segment of the Interstate provides access to several major north–south streets, including Lewis, Harvard, and Yale avenues. The interchanges at Sheridan Road and Memorial Drive are inverted single-point urban interchanges (SPUI) with lefthand entrance and exit ramps intersecting the surface street at a single traffic signal. East of here, I-244 intersects the Gilcrease Expressway again at its eastern terminus; this interchange also forms the eastern terminus of SH-11, which runs along the Gilcrease for its easternmost stretch. The next interchange to the east, serving Mingo Road, provides an exit for eastbound traffic and an entry to westbound traffic. I-244 then junctions with US-169, the Mingo Valley Expressway (a freeway). East of US-169 lies a parclo interchange with Garnett Road and a partial interchange, providing only an eastbound exit and westbound entrance, with 129th East Avenue. I-244 then reaches its eastern terminus at a yield sign, where it merges into eastbound I-44/SH-66. US-412 continues east along I-44.

==History==
I-244 was completed in December 1975. It was named the Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway east from Downtown by the Oklahoma Highway Commission in 1984. 

The spans carrying I-244/US-75 across the Arkansas River to Downtown Tulsa were built in 1967. A $78 million (equivalent to $ in ) project commenced in April 2011 to replace the westbound bridge. The new westbound bridge across the Arkansas River opened to traffic on December 19, 2012.

Work started on the new eastbound bridge on June 7, 2013. A ribbon-cutting ceremony took place on September 15, 2014, for the completion of the span.
==Future==

More recently, the Greenwood District in Tulsa has called for the removal of the I-244 corridor, which is seen as just as damaging to the community as the Tulsa race massacre. However, the segment is also part of the future I-42 corridor, making this unlikely.

<text>Dziemiany is a village in Kościerzyna County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Dziemiany. It lies approximately south-west of Kościerzyna and south-west of the regional capital Gdańsk. It was the location of the Nazi concentration camp &quot;Dzimianen&quot; - &quot;Sophienwalde&quot;, a subcamp of the concentration camp Stutthof. Here the &quot;SS-Truppenübungsplatz Westpreußen&quot; was located during the occupation of Poland in World War II.

==History==
Dziemiany was a royal village of the Polish Crown, administratively located in the Tczew County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

===World War II===
Dziemiany was overrun on the second day of the Nazi German invasion of Poland of September 1939. Several weeks later on 26 October 1939 by a decree of Adolf Hitler the region was annexed into the Reich as &quot;Reichsagau Danzig Westpreussen&quot;. Dziemiany was renamed Sophienwalde, population: 4,428 ethnic Poles. Deportations and expulsions of all prominent citizens followed. Polish schools and all institutions were shut down.

In the fall of 1943 during Operation Barbarossa the Germans began constructing military range called the &quot;Truppenübungsplatz Westpreußen&quot; in Dziemiany and neighbouring villages on an area of . All farmers were deported to Potulice concentration camp. The range was designed for training of the new SS Sturm brigades including Waffen-SS, as well as rocket testing. It was built by around 1,000 international prisoners kept at the barracks of a temporary camp in Brusy, the 300 inmates of KL Potulice, and about 400–500 prisoners of KL Stutthof. Notable group of about 400 slave workers arrived in the fall of 1944, captured in the Warsaw Uprising. Also notable was the group of about 500 Jewish women kept at the sub-camp in Dziemiany (&quot;Sophienwalde&quot;) employed to service the &quot;SS&quot; soldiers. In total, the range was built by about 3,000 prisoners. The first trainees arrived from Latvia, Romania and Hungary. Average training lasted from two to six weeks. The range was never fully completed, because of the Soviet advance.

<text>Brusy (; formerly ) is a town in northern Poland, located in the Chojnice County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. As of June 2023, the town has a population of 5,103.

==History==

Brusy was a royal village of the Polish Crown, administratively located in the Tuchola County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

Since the 19th century Brusy was an important center of the Kashub movement, although a fair amount of Kashubians from Brusy emigrated to Winona, Minnesota in the late 1900s. In 2007, the ninth Congress of Kashubians was held here, and in 2012, the annual Kashubian Unity Day celebration was conducted here. A Kashubian secondary school is also located in the town.

In the interwar period, it was administratively located in the Chojnice County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland. According to the 1921 census, Brusy had a population of 2,260, 98.2% Polish.

During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), inhabitants of Brusy were among over 450 Poles massacred by the Germans in autumn of 1939 in the Igielska Valley. In November 1939 the SS, Gestapo and Selbstschutz murdered local Polish teachers in a large massacre of Polish teachers near Skarszewy. Further executions of local Poles were carried out in January 1940 in the Igielska Valley and in the fields near Chojnice. In May 1942, the Germans expelled dozens of Poles, whose farms were handed over to Germans as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. The secret Polish resistance organization Pomeranian Griffin (Gryf Pomorski) operated in the Brusy area under the leadership of Colonel Józef Wrycza, who was also a Roman Catholic priest. The Germans set up a Waffen-SS training ground in the vicinity, and located its administration in Brusy. Brusy was also the location of the Nazi German Bruss subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp, in which around 500 female prisoners were held as forced labour.

It has obtained town rights on 1 January 1988.

<text>Mbube is a form of South African vocal music, made famous by the South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The word &quot;mbube&quot; means &quot;Lion&quot; in Zulu. Traditionally performed &quot;acappella&quot;, the members of the group are male, although a few groups have a female singer. In this form, groups of voices singing homophonically in rhythmic unison are employed to create intricate harmonies and textures.
==Background==

In Johannesburg, Solomon Linda, a man from Natal, created one of the most famous African songs, &quot;Mbube&quot;, which eventually became its own genre. In 1933 Linda began singing with a group of friends called the Evening Birds. In 1939, they recorded a few tracks for Gallo Records when Linda improvised the first 15 notes of a song they called &quot;Mbube&quot;. The success of this song led to the conception of a whole new genre, characterized by a loud and powerful cappella four part harmony, accompanied by dancing. The song was later made internationally famous, by The Weavers as &quot;Wimoweh&quot; in 1948 and then as &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; by The Tokens in 1961. Miriam Makeba&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; in the 1960s helped popularize the genre and establish the singing tradition. However, it was Robert John’s rendition of &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; that is the most well-known; the song reached #3 on the US charts, and selling more than one million copies for which he was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Associated with poor migrant workers, the origins of Mbube can be traced back to the 1920s in the Natal region when the area became heavily industrialized with coalmines and factories. According to Joseph Shabalala (leader and founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo), young South African Zulu men from nearby towns and villages began to flock to this area to find work, often in mines. These men brought with them their own cultures and, in order to preserve a sense of community, formed choirs. These male workers were often lodging in hostels where they created a weekend social life that revolved around singing and dancing. There were competitions where the best groups would showcase their talents and a winner would be awarded not with money, but honor. As these competitions became more popular so did this new style of music. It spread to Johannesburg, one of the largest South African cities. Mbube is a precursor to the more currently popular African choral genres mbaqanga and iscathamiya. Since the formation of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the mbube has fallen out of style in favor of isicathamiya, which is a softer, lighter genre.

<text>Southern Syria ( ) is a geographical term referring to the southern portion of either the Ottoman-period Vilayet of Syria, or the modern-day Arab Republic of Syria.

The term was used in the Arabic language primarily from 1919 until the end of the Franco-Syrian war in July 1920, during which the Arab Kingdom of Syria existed.

Zachary Foster, in his Princeton University doctoral dissertation, has written that in the decades prior to World War I, the term “Southern Syria” was the least frequently used out of ten different ways to describe the region of Palestine in Arabic, noting it was so rare that “it took me nearly a decade to find a handful of references”.

==Background==
Throughout the Ottoman period, prior to World War I, the Levant was viewed administratively as part of one province called the Vilayet of Syria and was divided into districts known as &quot;Sanjaks&quot;.

Palestine was, by the end of 19th and early 20th centuries divided into the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, the Nablus Sanjak, and the Acre Sanjak (under Beirut Vilayet from 1888, and previously under Syria Vilayet), and a short-lived Mutasarrıfate of Karak in Transjordan (split as a new administrative unit from Syria Vilayet in 1894/5). In 1884, the governor of Damascus proposed the establishment of a new Vilayet in southern Syria, composed of the regions of Jerusalem, Balqa&#x27; and Ma&#x27;an though nothing came out of this.

In the beginning of Faisal’s reign in the Arab Kingdom of Syria, particularly after the San Remo Conference of March 1920, the term &quot;Southern Syria&quot; emerged as a political neologism synonymous with Palestine, and it would take on an increased political significance as a way of rejecting the separation of Palestine from the Kingdom.

==Usage during British and French occupation==

In the early 20th century, the term &quot;Southern Syria&quot; was a slogan that implied support for a Greater Syria nationalism associated with the kingdom promised to the Hashemite dynasty of the Hejaz by the British during World War I. 

After the war, the Hashemite prince Faisal attempted to establish Pan-Levantine state —a united kingdom that would comprise all of what eventually became Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, and Palestine, but he was stymied by conflicting promises made by the British to different parties (see Sykes–Picot Agreement), leading to the French creation of the mandate of Syria and Lebanon in 1920.

One of the resolutions adopted at the first Palestinian Arab Congress in 1919, Jerusalem, was:
&quot;We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria, and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds.&quot; Yoav Gelber notes that the Historians of Palestinian Nationalism such as Yehoshua Porath and Muhammad Y. Muslih consider the declaration to have been ideologically disingenuous, pointing out that there was a split among Palestinians regarding the resolutions&#x27; implications. The younger generation was eager to pursue political opportunities in a unified Levantine state under Faisal I, and the older generation wished for Palestine&#x27;s Independence to maintain their autonomous power in the post-Ottoman world order. Nonetheless, the resolution was mainly supported in the hopes of thwarting support for the Jewish National Homeland that was introduced in the 1917 Balfour Declaration on the occasion of the upcoming San Remo Conference by presenting that Palestine already belongs to another nation than Jews. The notables in Faisal&#x27;s government in Damascus, such as Iraqis and Damascenes, including the Palestinians, had some conflict, and each sought to place their interests above others.

According to the Minutes of the Ninth Session of the League of Nations&#x27; Permanent Mandates Commission, held in 1926, &quot;Southern Syria&quot; was suggested by some as the name of Mandatory Palestine in the Arabic language. The reports say the following:
&quot;Colonel Symes explained that the country was described as &#x27;Palestine&#x27; by Europeans and as &#x27;Falestin&#x27; by the Arabs. The Hebrew name for the country was the designation &#x27;Land of Israel&#x27;, and the Government, to meet Jewish wishes, had agreed that the word &quot;Palestine&quot; in Hebrew characters should be followed in all official documents by the initials that stood for that designation. As a set-off to this, certain Arab politicians suggested that the country should be called &#x27;Southern Syria&#x27; in order to emphasize its close relation with another Arab State&quot;. In 1932, a Palestinian Arab party named whose name &quot;Hizb Al-Istiqlal&quot; (Independence Party ) was established in Mandatory Palestine by the Sorbonne educated lawyer Awni Abd al-Hadi, whom Daniel Pipes says it the reaffirmed support for the incorporation of Palestine and its people into a Pan-Levantine state.

After when Mandatory Palestine ceased to exist in the aftermath of the Palestine War: the term has been used by Syrian Baathists who sought to expand Syria&#x27;s borders and justify aggression against Israel, such as Hafiz Al Assad in 1974. The Baathists later went on to create Baathist Palestinian groups such as Al-Saqia in an effort to dominate the PLO and wrest it from Fatah. 
As of the 1990s Israeli-Syrian peace process, and the Syrian Civil War in the early 2010s: the Baathist party of Syria stopped claiming Israel and the Palestinian territories as &quot;Southern Syria&quot;.

<text>Cedynia (; , ) is a small historic town in Poland, and the administrative seat of Gmina Cedynia in Gryfino County, West Pomeranian Voivodeship. It is situated close to the Oder river and the border with Germany. The town is known for the 972 Battle of Cedynia, the first historically recorded battle of Poland.

==Geography==
Cedynia lies in an area that formed part of historic regions of Pomerania and Greater Poland, before later being part of Neumark. It is situated close to the Oder river, which forms the Germany–Poland border; it thereby is the westernmost town in Poland (neighbouring Osinów Dolny lies even further to the west, right on the German border, but is classified as a village). A road border crossing leads to the German town of Bad Freienwalde in the southwest.

The town gives its name to an extended protected area known as Cedynia Landscape Park.

== History ==
Largely depopulated during the Migration Period, the first Slavic settlement came into existence in the 8th century, when a gród fortification was erected in the area. Around 967, it became part of the emerging Polish state. According to the Cedynia website, the &quot;Name of city appears in documents under oldest written records already in the year 972 as &quot;Cidini&quot;, in 1187 as &quot;Zedin&quot; and &quot;Cedene&quot;, in 1240 as &quot;Ceden&quot;. &quot;
On 24 June 972, the first historically recorded battle of the Polan dukes, the Battle of Cedynia, took place at this location: the Piast duke Mieszko I of Poland and his brother Czcibor defeated the invading forces of the Saxon count Odo I, who then ruled as a margrave in the Saxon Eastern March (Lusatia). Information about this battle is found both in the chronicles by Thietmar of Merseburg and in the &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; by Gallus Anonymus. After Emperor Otto II intervened, a peace was reached at the Imperial Diet in Quedlinburg the next year.

Under Mieszko&#x27;s son Bolesław the name Poland was used for the first time. The Battle of Cedynia was the first of Mieszko and Bolesław&#x27;s numerous battles that they took up in their conquest attempts in the Polabian border territories soon after they received positions as dukes, mainly in the German–Polish War that lasted from 1002 until the 1018 Peace of Bautzen. Following the death of Bolesław III Wrymouth and the fragmentation of Poland, Cedynia was part of the Duchy of Greater Poland. Together with Santok and Drezdenko, it remained the seat of a (Greater) Polish castellany on the Pomeranian border in the 12th and 13th centuries. 

With adjacent Lubusz Land in the south, the town became a part of the &quot;Neumark&quot; acquisitions of the Ascanian margraves John I and of Otto III of Brandenburg in 1248/52. In 1278 the Cistercians from nearby Chorin Abbey erected a nunnery there, which was secularised in 1555 and finally dissolved in 1611, after the Reformation. In 1373 the town became part of the Lands of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown, ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland, upon which Poland was to buy and re-incorporate the region, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold it to the Teutonic Order. In 1454 the Teutonic Knights sold the town to the Margraviate of Brandenburg in order to raise funds for war with Poland.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the town was destroyed by Swedes, whose King Gustavus Adolphus took quarter in the former nunnery. Town and nunnery were badly destroyed in subsequent battles. In 1641 the Hohenzollern elector Frederick William of Brandenburg had the western wing of the nunnery&#x27;s ruin rebuilt as a Baroque hunting lodge.

In 1701 the town, with all of Brandenburg, became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1815 Zehden became part of the Königsberg district within the Brandenburgian Frankfurt Region. In 1871, with all of Prussia, the town became part of the German Empire. 

In the last weeks of World War II, in March 1945, the town was conquered by joint Soviet and Polish forces during the Vistula-Oder offensive. After the war, the town was handed over to the Republic of Poland according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement and the remaining German population was expelled, also in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town was repopulated by Poles, often displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. A monument to the 972 Battle of Cedynia was erected in the town on the occasion of the millennial anniversary in 1972.

<text>General elections were held in Malaysia on Monday, 29 November 1999. Voting took place in all 193 parliamentary constituencies of Malaysia, each electing one Member of Parliament to the Dewan Rakyat, the dominant house of Parliament. State elections also took place in 394 state constituencies in 11 out of 13 states of Malaysia (except Sabah and Sarawak) on the same day. They were the last elections for Mahathir Mohamad as Prime Minister and Chairman of Barisan Nasional, until 2018. They were also the first elections held in a single day nationwide.

The opposition won a total of 113 state assembly seats, 98 of which went to the PAS, 11 to the DAP and 4 for Keadilan. In the states of Kelantan and Terengganu, the PAS won by a huge margin–41-2 against Barisan Nasional out of a total of 43 seats and 28-4 out of a total of 32 seats respectively, hence allowing them to form the state governments in these states. In addition, PAS also captured one-third of the state seats in Kedah, with the remaining two-thirds going to Barisan Nasional (UMNO won 16 seats, MCA 2 seats in Kedah).

The election results were seen as a great gain for PAS, who previously had no state seats in Kedah and capturing only one seat in Terengganu in the 1995 General Elections. Observers attributed this to the neglect by the Federal Administration in the states of Terengganu and Kelantan due to administration by different parties.

<doc id="498702" wikidata="Q1477428" url="?curid=498702" title="M-Base">
<text>The term &quot;M-Base&quot; is used in several ways. In the 1980s, a loose collective of young African American musicians including Steve Coleman, Graham Haynes, Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen, Robin Eubanks, and Greg Osby emerged in Brooklyn with a new sound and specific ideas about creative expression. Using a term coined by Steve Coleman, they called these ideas &quot;M-Base-concept&quot; (short for &quot;macro-basic array of structured extemporization&quot;) and critics have used this term to categorize this scene&#x27;s music as a jazz style. But Coleman stressed &quot;M-Base&quot; doesn&#x27;t denote a musical style but a way of thinking about creating music. Coleman also refuses the word &quot;jazz&quot; as a label for his music and the music tradition represented by musicians like John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, etc. However, the musicians of the M-Base movement, which also included dancers and poets, strived for common creative musical languages, so their early recordings show many similarities reflecting their common ideas, the experiences of working together, and their similar cultural background. To label this kind of music, jazz critics have established the word &quot;M-Base&quot; as a jazz style for lack of a better term, distorting its original meaning.

==Music associated with the term &quot;M-Base&quot;==
In 1991 a significant number of M-Base participants labelled as &quot;M-Base Collective&quot; recorded the CD &quot;Anatomy of a Groove&quot;. Most of them previously contributed to CDs by alto saxophonist Steve Coleman, whose creativity has been a pivotal factor in that movement, although he refused to be called its leader or founder. Coleman and his friend Greg Osby, who plays alto saxophone in a related style, together led the group Strata Institute, which recorded two CDs (the second with tenor saxophonist Von Freeman as a further leader). Under the name of Osby, a number of CDs with a specific character have been released starting in 1987, which also coined the perception of &quot;M-Base&quot; jazz. Tenor saxophonist and flutist Gary Thomas admittedly didn&#x27;t take part in the M-Base initiative, but joined them, and there were similarities in his way of playing. He can be heard on recordings of Coleman and Osby, and his own CDs are also labelled as &quot;M-Base-style&quot;. All three saxophonists contributed to the CD &quot;Jump World&quot; by singer Cassandra Wilson.

Pianist Andrew Hill said about Greg Osby: &quot;He has an incredible sense of rhythm and harmonic accuracy, and picks the right notes with a precision that isn&#x27;t common to people with his technical versatility. He&#x27;s developed into a fully rounded artist who can play various styles extremely well – better than most.&quot; Greg Osby said about Gary Thomas: &quot;He&#x27;s extremely intelligent and has a capacity for absorption that exceeds that of most people that I know […] He has his own compositional and improvisational method that is peerless in my opinion. He&#x27;s my favourite tenor saxophone player on the contemporary scene.&quot; Clarinettist and composer Don Byron called Steve Coleman &quot;an exceptional personality of American music history.&quot;

Antecedents to M-Base were identified by jazz critic Bill Milkowski as the Miles Davis-led band featured on recordings like 1975&#x27;s &quot;Agharta&quot;; he noted the combination of Sonny Fortune&#x27;s acerbic saxophone lines atop the syncopated grooves performed by the rhythm section of drummer Al Foster, bassist Michael Henderson, and rhythm guitarist Reggie Lucas.

==Further history==
The ideas of the M-Base concept were largely incompatible with the requirements of music business. Most participants of the M-Base movement turned to more conventional music. Cassandra Wilson&#x27;s blues- and folk-influenced music has been fairly suitable for an adaption to the taste of a larger audience. Wilson has been signed to Blue Note Records since 1993. Though two of Gary Thomas&#x27; recordings were highly rated by &quot;DownBeat&quot; he only had a contract with a small European company and his performance opportunities were virtually limited to Europe. Since 1997, he has put his career as a bandleader on hold to teach at Peabody Music Institute. Greg Osby signed with Blue Note Records in 1990 and developed a specific balancing act between an enhanced reverence to tradition and maintaining his new direction. In 2008, Osby launched his own small label. Steve Coleman has developed his music further in accordance with the M-Base concept. In the 1990s his CDs were released by the major label BMG. Thereafter he became practically an underground artist in the U.S. again, in that his music was only available as imports, distributed by a small French label. In 2007 John Zorn&#x27;s small label Tzadik Records released a solo CD of Coleman. In 2010 the small advanced label Pi Recordings began to release Steve Coleman&#x27;s recordings.

Although the musical line initially called &quot;M-Base&quot; became more than ever focused on Steve Coleman, a number of younger musicians (e.g. a range of excellent drummers) have made substantial creative contributions to his music and his influence is to be found in several musical fields – both in terms of music technique and of the music&#x27;s meaning. Pianist Vijay Iyer (who was chosen as &quot;Jazz Musician of the Year 2010&quot; by the Jazz Journalists Association) said, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to overstate Steve [Coleman&#x27;s] influence. He&#x27;s affected more than one generation, as much as anyone since John Coltrane. It&#x27;s not just that you can connect the dots by playing seven or 11 beats. What sits behind his influence is this global perspective on music and life. He has a point of view of what he does and why he does it.&quot;

==M-Base concept==
Steve Coleman explained the substantial elements of the concept as:
* improvisation and structure
* contemporary relevance
* music as expression of life experience
* growth through creativity and philosophical broadening
* use of non-western concepts

The M-Base concept reminds of the creative energy of the bebop originators, their loose collective, and also of their musical goals. The concept does not include &quot;neo-classical jazz&quot;, free music without structures, fusion music, music which isn&#x27;t mainly improvised, or music shaped with respect to commercial aspects.

<text>NationStates (formerly Jennifer Government: NationStates) is a multiplayer government simulation browser game created and developed by Max Barry. Based loosely on Barry&#x27;s novel &quot;Jennifer Government&quot;, the game launched on 13 November 2002 with the site originally founded to publicize and promote the novel one week before its release. &quot;NationStates&quot; continues to promote books written by Barry, but has developed to be a sizable online community, with an accompanying forum board. , over 9 million user-created nations have been created with 323,853 nations active.

== History ==

&quot;NationStates&quot;, then named &quot;Jennifer Government: NationStates&quot;, was launched on 13 November 2002 by Australian novelist Max Barry to help promote the sale of his novel &quot;Jennifer Government&quot;, which &quot;NationStates&quot; is loosely based on, prior to its release. Although &quot;NationStates&quot; launched in November 2002, Barry worked on beta versions of the game as early as 7 August 2002. Barry has stated that he was influenced to create the website after he took a multiple-choice political quiz to determine a person&#x27;s political affiliations, adding that &quot;it was fun, but I also wanted to see what kind of country my policies created, and have to deal with the consequences&quot;.

On 21 January 2008, Barry received a cease and desist letter from the United Nations (UN) for unauthorized usage of its name and emblem for the game&#x27;s fictional international organization which was based on the UN. As a result, Barry changed the name of the organization to the &quot;World Assembly&quot;, introducing the changes as an April Fool&#x27;s prank. Barry joked about the situation, stating &quot;it&#x27;s the place where players come together to debate and pass international law; in the five years the game has been running, they&#x27;ve implemented privacy safeguards, promoted religious tolerance, passed a universal bill of rights, and outlawed child labor, amongst 240 other resolutions [...] Clearly this wasn&#x27;t anything the real UN wanted to be associated with.&quot;

== Gameplay ==

Players register by setting up their nation through answering a short questionnaire which determines the type of government the nation will have. Players can determine their nation&#x27;s name, flag, motto, currency, animal, capital, leader, and faith. Additionally, players can publish articles known as &quot;factbooks&quot; which can convey information about the player&#x27;s nation.

The gameplay is centered on the player deciding government policies through &quot;issues&quot;. Issues are written by either Barry or by the players themselves with moderator editing and are based on real-world politics with an &quot;absurd and humorous direction&quot;. The player may choose from a list of options or dismiss the issue, and the player&#x27;s responses may affect the nation&#x27;s status across three main statistics: political freedom, civil rights, and economic freedom; based on these main statuses, the nation is assigned to one of twenty-seven government classifications which are determined on a three-axis scale of personal, economic, and political freedom. When &quot;NationStates&quot; initially launched, players received only one issue per day, however, multiple issues are now received per day on timed intervals. 

Players can also choose to join the World Assembly, a United Nations-like body concerned with the drafting and passage of international law. Membership in the World Assembly is voluntary. Players spawn in one of five &quot;Pacific&quot; regions (North, South, East, West, and just the &quot;Pacific&quot;) or other regions designated as &quot;frontiers&quot; which allow them to receive new nations. Some regions are designated as &quot;strongholds&quot;, meaning they cannot receive new nations. Regardless of a nation&#x27;s founding region, they can then move to different regions, which are a community function similar to a chat room. If a Nation gets banned or ejected from a region, they will go to one of three regions known as &quot;Sinkers&quot;: The Rejected Realms, The Outback, or The Plains of Perdition. Nations that have ceased to exist and been restored will respawn in one of three &quot;Restorer&quot; regions: Osiris, Balder, or Lazarus. Users can create their own regions. , there are 29,319 regions, the vast majority of them being strongholds. &quot;NationStates&quot; does not have a win condition nor winners and losers. The game also does not have any warring or trading mechanics, although players can roleplay such interactions.

&quot;NationStates&quot; has an active forum board. The board was hosted from 2004 to 2009 by Jolt Online Gaming, before becoming self-hosted when Jolt was acquired by OMAC Holdings. There are a variety of categories in which many topics can be found. , approximately 33.14 million posts have been made within approximately 443,000 forum threads, with just over 1.8 million users being registered. 
== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===

In the 2009 book &quot;The Video Game Theory Reader 2&quot;, Lars Konzack critiqued that &quot;NationStates&quot; promoted libertarianism, but also stated that it is &quot;open to experimentation and reflection on politics rather than being merely political propaganda. It becomes a philosophical game in which the player is invited to become part of an examination of political ideas. This game takes advantage of the potential in games to truly put the player in control and let them reflect on their own decisions, investigating political theory turned into meaningful game aesthetics.&quot; In the 2008 book &quot;The Art and Science of Interface and Interaction Design&quot;, C. Paul said that &quot;NationStates&quot; is &quot;an interesting take on the interplay of freedom and control (and governance without government)&quot;. In a 2004 article, the BBC described &quot;NationStates&quot; as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek nation simulation game&quot;.

&quot;Jay Is Games&quot;″ Jerrad praised the game, stating &quot;the real beauty in this game is that it&#x27;s accessible on so many levels&quot;. &quot;ProgrammableWeb&quot;″s Kevin Sundstrom listed &quot;NationStates&quot; among its &quot;30 New APIs&quot;, remarking that its application programming interface (API) &quot;provides a developer interface for automate game world data collection&quot;. &quot;Super Jump Magazine&quot;″s Andrew Johnston described &quot;NationStates&quot; as &quot;a product of an era in which people still created websites solely as a means of self-expression&quot;.

=== Popularity ===

The game attracted a thousand players within two weeks, and had 20,700 by the end of the first year. Barry was surprised by the popularity of the game, and saw its discussion forums developing into an arena for political debate. He was impressed by some of the activity in the forums, relating how &quot;one nation accused another of conducting secret missile tests and posted photos to prove it. That escalated into an international crisis that was only solved by sending in teams of independent weapons inspectors&quot;. In 2007, Barry stated that when he launched the game, he initially believed that &quot;nobody would be interested in playing a political simulation game. I imagined &quot;NationStates&quot; as the kind of game you might stumble across, have fun with for a week or two, then move on. Then this entire community just popped into existence, as vibrant and dedicated as any on the internet&quot;.

In December 2016, Alexa Internet ranked &quot;NationStates&quot; as the 14,380th most visited website.

<text> (or &quot;4L4Y&quot;, &#x27;, &quot;Anak Jablay&quot; or&#x27;, ) is an Indonesian pop culture phenomenon. It is a stereotype describing something &quot;tacky&quot; (&#x27;) and/or &quot;cheesy&quot; (&#x27;). The Alay culture phenomena spans a wide array of styles in music, dress, and messaging. It has often been compared to that of the Jejemon phenomenon originating from the Philippines, and Harajuku from Japan. Although, the former emerged much later and the latter was even admired in the West.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Alay&quot; or &quot;Alayen&quot; or &quot;Sharon Alay&quot; has no exact meaning or obvious derivation. Various definitions of alay are offered. One theory that is widely accepted is that &quot;Alay&quot; comes from the term &quot; (Indonesian: Kiteflyer), a pejorative describing someone having certain attributes from spending most of their time outside and getting sunburnt (e.g. reddened hair and skin). Kites are also considered as cheap entertainment to the middle and lower class in modern Indonesia, stereotyping alay as a part of that class.

==Characteristics==

===Writing style===
&quot; (Indonesian: Tulisan alay) is a form of the Indonesian language that has undergone &quot;excessive leet transformation&quot;. Contrary to the popular belief that it is &quot;destroying&quot; the national language, grammatical standards are met in contrast to the modern Indonesian slang language. Similar to the jejebets, alay texts offer an alternative in compressing words so that they are under the 160 character-limit in text messages, often to the point that they are impossible to read. Rules in capitalization are mostly ignored.

Alay text may have originated from the method of making strong passwords for internet accounts, which requires combinations of small and capital letters, numbers, as well as special characters. Normally, to keep the password meaningful and easy to remember, the password would consist of normal words, where some letters are capitalized or substituted with numbers (e.g. the letter a with 4, the letter o with 0). Soon this becomes a habit in writing text in general, and improved with mixing English and Indonesian in one sentence.

Confusing text that could not be understood properly and probably has no meaning (except for the writer), is also considered as Alay Text. This type of text usually contains information of the writer&#x27;s mood and feelings, it is also common for the text to contain the writer&#x27;s own philosophy on certain topics such as love, heart break, and relationships.
According to &quot;The Jakarta Post&quot;, a high school student from East Java initiated the trend and became famous after her writings were discussed in forums and blogs not because they were great, but they were in &quot;code&quot;. Her approach in writing attracted much attention, with some people reproducing her writings in forums and blogs.

<text>Indigenous or Aboriginal rock is a style of music which mixes rock music with the instrumentation and singing styles of Indigenous peoples. Two countries with prominent Aboriginal rock scenes are Australia and Canada.

==Australia==

In Australia, Aboriginal rock mixes rock styles and instruments (e.g. electric (guitar, bass and drums) with Indigenous Australian instruments such as the didgeridoo and clapsticks. Aboriginal rock is mostly performed by Indigenous bands, although some bands include non-Aboriginal members.

Bands include Yothu Yindi, Us Mob and No Fixed Address. Yothu Yindi, with vocalist Mandawuy Yunupingu has politicised lyrics, such as 1991&#x27;s &quot;Treaty&quot;. Other songs relate more generally to Aboriginal culture. Another major band was the Warumpi Band, which toured with Midnight Oil. The Warumpi Band focuses more on the Aboriginal aspects of the music, rather than the rock sound of Yothu Yindi. In the 2000s, Aboriginal bands such as NoKTuRNL have adopted a rap metal or nu metal sound. Formal training institutions include the Government sponsored Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts.

Famous songs include &quot;Treaty&quot;, &quot;My Island Home&quot;, and &quot;Blackfella/Whitefella&quot;.

==Canada==

Indigenous peoples in Canada include First Nations, Métis and Inuit. Some examples of Canadian Indigenous rock bands or artists include Aysanabee, Breach of Trust, Kashtin, Bruthers of Different Muthers, Burnt Project 1, Digging Roots, Edward Gamblin, The Halluci Nation (formerly A Tribe Called Red), George Leach, Derek Miller, Robbie Robertson, Julian Taylor, Ruby Waters, and Tom Wilson.

==Ecuador==
Several mestizo-bands in Ecuador made use of indigenous musical elements in rock music since the 1990s. Rocola Bacalao integrated Andean rhythms and made in their song-texts references to emblematic indigenous towns, such as Pujilí in Cotopaxi. Sal y Mileto and Casería de Lagartos coined the genre of new Ecuadorian Rock. Nevertheless, in the 1980s and the early 1990s the rhythm of the social as expressed in Ecuadorian rock was characterized by hopelessness and resistance or even resignation against repression. With the emergence of a powerful indigenous movement the rhythm changed. The most emblematic references towards the political impact of the indigenous movement are made by the metalband Aztra and the hardcore band CURARE at the beginning of the 2000s, during the heyday of indigenous social protest against neoliberalism and for (ethnic) democratization.

<doc id="498727" wikidata="Q4139973" url="?curid=498727" title="Growth rate (group theory)">
<text>In the mathematical subject of geometric group theory, the growth rate of a group with respect to a symmetric generating set describes how fast a group grows. Every element in the group can be written as a product of generators, and the growth rate counts the number of elements that can be written as a product of length &quot;n&quot;.

==Definition==
Suppose &quot;G&quot; is a finitely generated group; and &quot;T&quot; is a finite &quot;symmetric&quot; set of generators
(symmetric means that if formula_1 then formula_2).
Any element formula_3 can be expressed as a word in the &quot;T&quot;-alphabet

:formula_4

Consider the subset of all elements of &quot;G&quot; that can be expressed by such a word of length ≤ &quot;n&quot;

:formula_5

This set is just the closed ball of radius &quot;n&quot; in the word metric &quot;d&quot; on &quot;G&quot; with respect to the generating set &quot;T&quot;:

:formula_6

More geometrically, formula_7 is the set of vertices in the Cayley graph with respect to &quot;T&quot; that are within distance &quot;n&quot; of the identity.

Given two nondecreasing positive functions &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; one can say that they are equivalent (formula_8) if there is a constant &quot;C&quot; such that for all positive integers &quot;n&quot;,

:formula_9

for example formula_10 if formula_11.

Then the growth rate of the group &quot;G&quot; can be defined as the corresponding equivalence class of the function
:formula_12
where formula_13 denotes the number of elements in the set formula_7. Although the function formula_15 depends on the set of generators &quot;T&quot; its rate of growth does not (see below) and therefore the rate of growth gives an invariant of a group.

The word metric &quot;d&quot; and therefore sets formula_7 depend on the generating set &quot;T&quot;. However, any two such metrics are &quot;bilipschitz&quot; &quot;equivalent&quot; in the following sense: for finite symmetric generating sets &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, there is a positive constant &quot;C&quot; such that
:formula_17
As an immediate corollary of this inequality we get that the growth rate does not depend on the choice of generating set.

==Polynomial and exponential growth==

If

:formula_18

for some formula_19 we say that &quot;G&quot; has a polynomial growth rate.
The infimum formula_20 of such &quot;ks is called the order of polynomial growth&quot;&#x27;.
According to Gromov&#x27;s theorem, a group of polynomial growth is a virtually nilpotent group, i.e. it has a nilpotent subgroup of finite index. In particular, the order of polynomial growth formula_20 has to be a natural number and in fact formula_22.

If formula_23 for some formula_24 we say that &quot;G&quot; has an exponential growth rate.
Every finitely generated &quot;G&quot; has at most exponential growth, i.e. for some formula_25 we have formula_26.

If formula_15 grows more slowly than any exponential function, &quot;G&quot; has a subexponential growth rate. Any such group is amenable.

==Examples==

* A free group of finite rank formula_28 has exponential growth rate.
* A finite group has constant growth—that is, polynomial growth of order 0—and this includes fundamental groups of manifolds whose universal cover is compact.
* If &quot;M&quot; is a closed negatively curved Riemannian manifold then its fundamental group formula_29 has exponential growth rate. John Milnor proved this using the fact that the word metric on formula_29 is quasi-isometric to the universal cover of &quot;M&quot;.
* The free abelian group formula_31 has a polynomial growth rate of order &quot;d&quot;.
* The discrete Heisenberg group formula_32 has a polynomial growth rate of order 4. This fact is a special case of the general theorem of Hyman Bass and Yves Guivarch that is discussed in the article on Gromov&#x27;s theorem.
* The lamplighter group has an exponential growth. 
* The existence of groups with intermediate growth, i.e. subexponential but not polynomial was open for many years. The question was asked by Milnor in 1968 and was finally answered in the positive by Rostislav Grigorchuk in 1984. There are still open questions in this area and a complete picture of which orders of growth are possible and which are not is missing.
* The triangle groups include infinitely many finite groups (the spherical ones, corresponding to sphere), three groups of quadratic growth (the Euclidean ones, corresponding to Euclidean plane), and infinitely many groups of exponential growth (the hyperbolic ones, corresponding to the hyperbolic plane).

<text>Kathryn Dwyer Sullivan (born October 3, 1951) is an American geologist, oceanographer, and former NASA astronaut and US Navy officer. She was a crew member on three Space Shuttle missions.

A graduate of University of California, Santa Cruz, in the United States, and Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada—where she earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in geology in 1978—Sullivan was selected as one of the six women among the 35 astronaut candidate in NASA Astronaut Group 8, the first group to include women. During her training, she became the first woman to be certified to wear a United States Air Force pressure suit, and on July 1, 1979, she set an unofficial sustained American aviation altitude record for women. During her first mission, STS-41-G, Sullivan performed the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA) by an American woman. On her second, STS-31, she helped deploy the Hubble Space Telescope. On the third, STS-45, she served as Payload Commander on the first Spacelab mission dedicated to NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth.

Sullivan was Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) after being confirmed by the US Senate on March 6, 2014. Her tenure ended on January 20, 2017, after which she was designated as the 2017 Charles A. Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum, and also served as a Senior Fellow at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. On June 7, 2020, Sullivan became the first woman to dive into the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of Earth&#x27;s oceans. In September 2021, President Joe Biden appointed her to the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

==Early life and education==
Kathryn Dwyer Sullivan was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on October 3, 1951, the daughter of Donald Paul Sullivan and his wife Barbara, Kelly. She had a brother, Grant. In 1958 the family moved to the San Fernando Valley in California, where her father worked in the aerospace industry for Marquardt Corporation. She was in the first grade at Havenhurst Elementary School, where Sally Ride was a classmate, but the school closed in 1958 to make way for Van Nuys Airport, and neither woman could recall meeting the other. During her school years she was a girl scout.

Sullivan graduated from William Howard Taft High School in the Woodland Hills district of Los Angeles, California, in 1969. She took both French and German in high school, and resolved to have a career in the foreign service. She chose to enter the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), on account of its renowned Russian studies program. The university required that humanities students take three science classes and vice versa. She chose to take courses in marine biology, topology and oceanography. She enjoyed these, and altered her course to take in more science subjects. She was an exchange student at the University of Bergen in Norway for the 1971–1972 school year and the two summers around it, and decided to change her major to oceanography. She was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Earth Sciences from UCSC in 1973, and a Doctor of Philosophy in geology from Dalhousie University and the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1978, writing her doctoral thesis on &quot;The structure and evolution of the Newfoundland Basin&quot; under the supervision of Michael John Keen. While at Dalhousie, she participated in several oceanographic expeditions that studied the floors of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

==NASA career==
===Selection and training===
When Sullivan visited her family for Christmas in 1976, her brother Grant, an aerospace engineer and corporate jet pilot, told her that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had issued a call for applications for a new group of astronauts. NASA had made it known that it was interested in recruiting women, and Grant encouraged her to apply. He had applied for both pilot and mission specialist positions. After she returned to Nova Scotia she saw a NASA ad in a science journal, and decided to apply. She reasoned that the Space Shuttle was a kind of research vessel, but her dream was still to descend to the ocean floor in a submersible. That prospect came closer when she received an offer from William B. F. Ryan from the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University to join his team exploring the ocean in the submersible . Ryan had been an unsuccessful finalist for NASA Astronaut Group 6 in 1967, and he counseled her to wait for NASA to call. They both felt that the odds on being accepted were long, but Sullivan did not join Ryan&#x27;s team while she waited to hear about her selection.

Grant&#x27;s application was unsuccessful, but Kathryn was invited to come to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) for a week of interviews and physical examinations commencing on November 14, 1977. She was the only woman in this group of twenty-five finalists. Over the course of a week she was given physical and psychological examinations, and was interviewed by a selection panel chaired by George Abbey. She was successful, and her selection as one of the six women among the 35 members of NASA Astronaut Group 8 was publicly announced on January 16, 1978. It was the first astronaut group to include women. Sullivan was one of the three members of the group (the others being Sally Ride and Steve Hawley) for whom NASA astronaut would be their first full-time paid job since leaving university.
On August 31, 1979, NASA announced that the 35 astronaut candidates had completed their training and evaluation, and were now officially astronauts, qualified for selection on space flight crews. To mark the occasion the Chief of the Astronaut Office, John Young, presented each of them with a silver NASA astronaut pin; they would become eligible for a gold one after they had flown in space. Like other astronaut groups before them, each was given a particular assignment. Sullivan helped develop systems management checklists for the first Space Shuttle flights. To give the newcomers more experience, they were periodically rotated to different jobs, so after nine months she became a mission manager at NASA&#x27;s High Altitude Research Project, based at nearby Ellington Air Force Base. She became the first woman to be certified to wear a United States Air Force pressure suit, and on July 1, 1979, she set an unofficial sustained American aviation altitude record for women of during a four-hour flight in a NASA WB-57F reconnaissance aircraft.

For the first Space Shuttle mission, STS-1, Sullivan was assigned to media support, working with Vic Ratner and Bob Walker on ABC News Radio. For the STS-2 mission she flew in the back seat of a NASA Northrop T-38 Talon chase plane piloted by fellow astronaut Hoot Gibson, photographing the Space Shuttle tiles to verify that none had been damaged. She was then assigned to the support crew at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), along with fellow astronauts Steve Hawley, Loren Shriver and Don Williams, for the next four Space Shuttle missions.

===STS-41-G===
In July 1983 Sullivan joined the Mission Development group, which organised and supervised the development of payloads for future missions that did not yet have a crew assigned to them. She was assigned the Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications&#x27; OSTA-3 satellite and the Orbital Refueling System (ORS). The objective of the latter was to demonstrate that the Space Shuttle could be used to refuel a satellite in orbit, thereby extending its useful life. For this the aging Landsat 4 satellite was chosen. In September 1983 she was officially assigned to this mission, which was designated STS-41-G.

Sally Ride was also assigned to this mission, so it became the first time that two women were in space together. The mission lifted off from the KSC in the on October 5, 1984. Sullivan performed the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA) by an American woman on October 11, 1984. With fellow mission specialist David Leestma, she performed a 3.5-hour spacewalk in which they operated the ORS to show that a satellite could be refueled in orbit. They installed a valve into a satellite propulsion system that mimicked that of Landsat4 and transferred of hydrazine to it using the ORS. This demonstrated that the procedure could be performed with a real satellite.

During the eight-day mission, the crew also deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations of Earth with the OSTA-3 pallet (including the SIR-B radar, FILE, and MAPS experiments) and large format camera (LFC), and conducted several in-cabin experiments as well as activating eight &quot;Getaway Special&quot; canisters. STS-41G completed 132 orbits of Earth in 197.5 hours, before landing back at the KSC on October 13, 1984.

===STS-61-J===
In September 1985 Sullivan was assigned to the STS-61-J mission, which was scheduled to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in August 1986. The original intention was that the HST would be periodically retrieved by the Space Shuttle and returned to Earth for maintenance, although some components were designed for servicing in-orbit. In 1984 NASA management decided this would be too dangerous and too costly, and that the HST would instead be maintained in-orbit by periodic servicing missions for up to fifteen years. Convinced that NASA would attempt to fix any component that jeopardized the HST&#x27;s mission whether it had been designated as serviceable or not, Sullivan pressed for as many components as possible to be replaceable or amenable to in-orbit servicing. Working with fellow astronaut Bruce McCandless II and NASA and Lockheed Corporation engineers, she ensured that there would be a complete set of tools and procedures for as many HST maintenance missions as possible.

The STS-61-J mission was cancelled after the January 1986 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, but the crew continued to work on the mission objectives. At this point, just fourteen systems were designated as &quot;on-orbit maintainable&quot;. There were up to twelve units in each one, so forty-three were designated as Block I &quot;on-orbit replaceable units&quot; (ORUs). Lockheed produced two lists of additional units that could be modified to be serviceable; there were twenty-six systems and fifty-one units in BlockII and eight systems and sixteen units in BlockIII. With more time available, an attempt was now made to work through these. Meanwhile, Sullivan served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-26, the Space Shuttle&#x27;s October 1988 return-to-flight mission. She chose the wakeup music, including a contribution from Robin Williams, who provided a pastiche of his &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; radio greeting. She continued working as CAPCOM on the STS-27 and STS-29 missions.

===STS-31===
At the end of March 1989, Sullivan returned to working on the HST mission, which was now designated STS-31. The crew was the same, except that Loren Shriver replaced Young as mission commander. STS-31 was launched from KSC, on April 24, 1990. During this five-day mission, crew members aboard the deployed the HST, and conducted middeck experiments involving the study of protein crystal growth, polymer membrane processing, and the effects of weightlessness and magnetic fields on an ion arc. They also operated several cameras, including the IMAX cargo bay camera, for Earth observations. Their apogee of above Earth was the highest yet achieved by a Space Shuttle orbiter. (It was later exceeded by the STS-82 HST servicing mission.)

The HST was deployed on the second day using &quot;Discovery&quot;″s Canadarm with the Shuttle doors opened towards the ground. In case McCandless and Sullivan had to perform an EVA, the Shuttle&#x27;s cabin pressure was lowered from to . At one point McCandless and Sullivan donned their space suits and entered the airlock to perform an emergency EVA to help deploy the Hubble&#x27;s solar arrays, but this was not required, as the engineers were able to deploy them with a series of commands from Earth. &quot;Discovery&quot; followed the HST for the next two days in case intervention was required. After making 76 orbits of Earth in 121 hours, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California, on April 29, 1990.

===STS-45===
Sullivan served as Payload Commander on STS-45, the first Spacelab mission dedicated to NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth. It lifted off in the &quot;Atlantis&quot; on March 24, 1992. During this nine-day mission, the crew operated the twelve experiments that constituted the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science cargo. This was the first of several flights designed to study the composition of the mid-atmosphere and its variations over an eleven-year solar cycle, the regular period of energetic activity by the Sun. The mission also included the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to measure the ozone layer in concert with other measurements taken by satellites. The mission also carried the Oscar statuette for the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award that film maker George Lucas received on March 30, the presentation being made by the STS-45 crew from Earth orbit. Sullivan had special responsibility for a dose-response experiment that involved firing an electron pulse into the upper atmosphere and recording the luminosity induced with a special camera. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at the Kennedy Space Center on April 2, 1992.

Sullivan left NASA in 1993 having flown on three Space Shuttle missions and logged 532 hours in space.

==Military career==

Sullivan became an adjunct professor of geology at Rice University in Houston in 1985. In this role she joined an oceanographic research cruise in 1988, where she met Andreas Rechnitzer, a US Navy oceanographer, and she started thinking about joining the US Naval Reserve (USNR) as an oceanography officer. She spoke to McCandless about it; he said he was having lunch with the Secretary of the Navy and would raise the matter. Later that year, Sullivan became a direct commission officer in the USNR with the rank of lieutenant commander.

In October 1990 she assumed command of a small specialized unit of oceanographers and meteorologists. Based at Naval Air Station Dallas, it provided support to the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command center on Guam. The unit was sent to Guam on January 13, 1991, four days before the start of Operation Desert Storm, and stayed for thirty days to augment the regular component responsible for the Western Pacific to free it to concentrate on the Persian Gulf. She retired from the USNR with the rank of captain in 2006.

==Civilian career==
===NOAA Chief Scientist===
While she was still working on preparations for STS-45, Sullivan received a call from Sylvia Earle, the chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 1981 Earle and Sullivan had been part of the first group of women admitted to the Explorers Club. Earle was stepping down from the role at the NOAA, and asked Sullivan if she was interested in taking over. With the permission of her STS-45 mission commander, Charles Bolden, Sullivan flew to Washington, DC, where she was interviewed by the Administrator of the NOAA, John A. Knauss. Her nomination was forwarded to the US Senate for confirmation, and she arranged to be seconded from NASA to NOAA as acting chief scientist from August 17, 1992.

Before she could be confirmed, President George H. W. Bush lost the 1992 United States presidential election and was succeeded by Bill Clinton, and the nomination was withdrawn. Sullivan still wanted the job, so she lobbied for it, enlisting the help of the outgoing Secretary of Commerce, Barbara Franklin, and senators Barbara Mikulski and Bill Nelson. The incoming Secretary of Commerce, Ronald H. Brown, forwarded her nomination to the Senate again in April, and she was confirmed on May 28, 1993. As chief scientist at NOAA, she oversaw a diverse portfolio which included ranging research into climate change, the use of satellites for oceanography, and marine biodiversity.

===Career 1996 to 2011===
Sullivan was president and CEO of the COSI Columbus, an interactive science center in Columbus, Ohio, from 1996 to 2006. From 2006 to 2011 she was Director for Ohio State University&#x27;s Battelle Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy while remaining a volunteer science advisor to COSI. She was appointed as vice chair of the National Science Board by President George W. Bush in 2004. In 2009 Sullivan was elected to a three-year term as the chair of the Section on General Interest in Science and Engineering for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

===Assistant Secretary of Commerce===

In January 2011 President Barack Obama sent the Senate his nomination of Sullivan to be an Assistant Secretary of Commerce. Sullivan was first nominated in December 2010, but because the Senate did not approve her nomination before the session ended, the White House renewed the nomination. On May 4, 2011, Sullivan was confirmed by unanimous consent of the Senate and appointed by President Obama to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction and Deputy Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Sullivan became Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Acting NOAA Administrator on February 28, 2013, following the resignation of Jane Lubchenco. President Obama nominated Sullivan to serve as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator on August 1, 2013, and she was confirmed by the Senate on March 6, 2014. Her term ended on January 20, 2017.
===Positions since 2017 ===
Sullivan was named the 2017 Charles A. Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History, a competitive twelve-month fellowship at the National Air and Space Museum. During her residence in the museum, Sullivan&#x27;s research focused on the Hubble Space Telescope. She has also served as a Senior Fellow at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. Her book &quot;Handprints on Hubble: An Astronaut&#x27;s Story of Invention&quot; was released from MIT Press in November 2019. It recounted her experience as part of the team that launched, rescued, repaired, and maintained the Hubble Space Telescope.

In June 2020 Sullivan traveled on an expedition aboard the Triton Submarines to the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, becoming the first woman and eighth person to reach the deepest known point in Earth&#x27;s oceans, and the first person to travel both to Challenger Deep and into space. In November 2020 Sullivan was named a volunteer member of Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential transition Agency Review Team to support transition efforts related to the Department of Commerce, and he appointed her to the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in September 2021.

==Awards and recognition==
Sullivan&#x27;s awards from NASA included the NASA Space Flight Medal in 1984, 1990 and 1992; the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1988 and 1991, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal in 1992, and a Certificate of Appreciation in 1996. She received the Haley Space Flight Award in 1991, the Gold Medal of the Society of Woman Geographers in 1993, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1994, and the Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award in 2004.
In 2014 Sullivan was named in the &quot;Time&quot; 100 list, an annual list of the world&#x27;s most influential people. John Glenn wrote in her blurb: Kathy is not just an ivory-tower scientist. She was part of NASA&#x27;s first class of female astronauts, selected in 1978, and went on to fly three shuttle missions. She is the first American woman to walk in space and served aboard the mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. That role in helping humanity look outward has not prevented her from looking homeward. The planet is suffering increasingly severe upheavals, at least partly a result of climate change—droughts, floods, typhoons, tornadoes. I believe my good friend Kathy is the right person for the right job at the right time.

Sullivan received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Willamette University in 2013 in conjunction with her presentation of a commencement address, and from Brown University in May 2015, for her &quot;abundant contributions to science, education and the public good, and her ongoing commitment to improving the state of our planet for future generations&quot;. In September 2015 she presented the John H. Glenn Lecture in Space History Series at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Titled &quot;Looking at Earth: An Astronaut&#x27;s Journey&quot;, Sullivan discussed her life of exploration and discovery, what it is like to fulfill her childhood dreams, and how NOAA&#x27;s study of our planet helps us understand today&#x27;s environmental challenges.

Sullivan was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2004, elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2016, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017. In 2020 the American Association of Geographers named her Honorary Geographer. She was on the list of the BBC&#x27;s 100 Women announced on November 23, 2020. In September 2023, Sullivan was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

<text>is one of ten wards of the Saitama City, in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, and is located in the northeastern part of the city. , the ward had an estimated population of 119,298 and a population density of 9,300 persons per km². Its total area was . Although Urawa-ku is the governmental center of Saitama City, Ōmiya-ku is the most active commercial and business centre in both Saitama City and Saitama Prefecture thanks to its transport infrastructure, especially railways connected at Ōmiya Station.

==Geography==
Ōmiya Ward is within the Ōmiya Terrace of the Kantō plain, in the center of Saitama City. It is in the Greater Tokyo Area and about 25 km north of central Tokyo.

===Neighboring Municipalities===
Ōmiya-ku is surrounded by Nishi-ku (to the west), Kita-ku (north), Minuma-ku (east), Urawa-ku (southeast), Chūō-ku (south), and Sakura-ku (southwest).

==History==

Ōmiya derives its name from a famous Shinto shrine, the Hikawa Shrine, which has been a place of pilgrimage since at least the Heian period. During the Edo period, the area flourished as Ōmiya-shuku, a post station on the Nakasendō highway, which connected Edo with Kyoto. Following the Meiji restoration, it became part of Urawa Prefecture which merged with Iwatsuki, Urawa, and Oshi Prefectures in 1871 to form Saitama Prefecture. The modern town of Ōmiya was officially created within Kitaadachi District, Saitama with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889.

On November 3, 1940 Ōmiya merged with the neighboring villages of Mihashi, Osato, Miyahara and Nisshin and was elevated to city status. Ōmiya continued to expand after the end of the war, absorbing the villages of Sashiougi, Mamiya, Uemizu, Katayanagi, Haruoka, and Nanasato on January 1, 1955.

On May 1, 2001 Ōmiya merged with Urawa and Yono to form Saitama City. In April 2003 Saitama became a city designated by government ordinance, and now the area of former Ōmiya City was divided between Kita-ku (north), Minuma-ku (east), Nishi-ku (west), and Ōmiya-ku (south).

<text>Nawitz is the German name of the town of Nawcz in northern Poland. During the occupation of Poland by the Third Reich in World War II the forced-labour camp Nawitz was set up as one of 40 subcamps of the notorious Nazi German Stutthof concentration camp near Gdańsk (totalling more than 85,000 victims before liberation).

The cemetery of prisoner victims of &quot;Auffanglager&quot; Nawitz along with those of Stutthof who perished during the final death march westward is located in the town.

<text>The Tōhoku Main Line () is a railway line in Japan operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East). The line starts from Tokyo Station in Chiyoda, Tokyo and passes through such cities as Saitama, Utsunomiya, Fukushima, and Sendai, before reaching the end of the line in Morioka. The line originally extended to Aomori, but was truncated upon the extension of the Tōhoku Shinkansen beyond Morioka, which mostly parallels the Tōhoku Main Line. A portion of the Tōhoku Main Line is also shared with the Keihin–Tōhoku Line ( between Tokyo Station and Ōmiya Station in Ōmiya-ku, Saitama) and the Saikyō Line ( between Akabane Station in the Kita ward of Tokyo and Ōmiya Station).

The portion of the line between Tokyo Station and Kuroiso Station in Nasushiobara, Tochigi is referred to by JR East as the [[Utsunomiya Line]], and the remaining section is referred to as the Tōhoku Line in regular service. Because of the difference in electrification south (1,500 V DC) and north (20 kV AC) of Kuroiso, there are no regularly scheduled passenger services that travel through that station.

==History==

The construction of the Tōhoku Main Line began in the Kantō region and extended to the north end of Honshu, and the city of Aomori. It is one of oldest railway lines in Japan, with construction beginning in the late 19th century. Until 1 November 1906, the current Tōhoku Main Line was run by a private company Nippon Railway.

In 1883, the first segment between Ueno and Kumagaya opened. In 1885, it was extended to Utsunomiya, but the Tone River had to be crossed by boat. Following construction of the Tone River Bridge in 1886, Utsunomiya and Ueno were directly connected. The line gradually extended further to the north; to Kōriyama, Sendai, Ichinoseki and Morioka. In 1891, the segment between Morioka and Aomori opened, creating the longest continuous railway line in Japan.

After 1906, the line was nationalized and became the Tōhoku Main Line operated by the Ministry of Railways. When Tokyo Station opened in 1925, the Tōhoku Main Line was extended from Ueno to the new station. Until the 1950s, this segment was used and many trains ran through both the Tōkaidō Main Line and Tōhoku Main Line. However, when the Tōhoku Shinkansen opened, it occupied land previously used for the tracks of mid and long-distance Tōhoku Main Line trains. As a result, only a small number of commuter lines such as the Keihin–Tōhoku Line now operate to Tokyo from the north, making Tokyo Station&#x27;s status as part of the Tōhoku Main Line somewhat circumspect.

In 2002, the Tōhoku Shinkansen was extended from Morioka to Hachinohe and the operations of the local track segment between those two cities was turned over to Iwate Ginga Railway (IGR) and Aoimori Railway. With the extension of the Tōhoku Shinkansen to Shin-Aomori station in 2010, the segment between Hachinohe and Aomori was delegated to the Aoimori Railway Company. The shortened Tōhoku Main Line is now the second-longest line in Japan, after the Sanin Main Line.

With the opening of the Ueno–Tokyo Line in March 2015, most longer distance trains once again operate directly through to the Tōkaidō Main Line via Tokyo Station, with the exception of some rush hour trains which terminate at Ueno Station.

===Double-tracking===
The Tokyo to Omiya section was double-tracked between 1892 and 1896, extended to Furukawa in 1908, Koyama the following year, and to Utsunomiya in 1913.

The Iwanuma - Sendai - Iwakiri section was double-tracked between 1920 &amp; 1923 and the Utsunomiya - Iwanuma section between 1959 and 1964. The Iwakiri - Morioka - Aomori section was double-tracked between 1951 and 1968, including the realigned section between Iwakiri and Atago in 1962.

===Electrification===
The Tokyo to Tabata section was electrified at 1,500 V DC in 1909, extended to Akabane in 1928, Omiya in 1932 and Kuroiso in 1959. Electrification was then continued north at 20 kV AC, reaching Fukushima in 1960, Sendai in 1961, Morioka in 1965, and Aomori in 1968.

===Former connecting lines===

<text>Karl Wilhelm Bücher (16 February 1847, Kirberg, Hesse – 12 November 1930, Leipzig, Saxony) was a German economist, one of the founders of non-market economics, and the founder of journalism as an academic discipline.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Karl Bücher was born in Kirberg, a small village in Hesse, as the son of a small, not very successful brushmaker and farmer; his grandfather Philipp was a cabinet-maker. Karl&#x27;s mother, Christiane née Dorn, was the daughter of a baker . Bücher attended a private preparatory school with a Pastor in nearby Dauborn and 1863–1866 the Catholic Gymnasium in Hadamar, where he was &quot;primus omnium&quot; . A former teacher of Bücher&#x27;s recommended he attend university and, after much discussion, Bücher&#x27;s parents finally consented .

=== Later years ===
Bücher studied at the University of Bonn (also part of Prussia), concentrating on History and Classics, with the aim to become a Gymnasium teacher . Bücher&#x27;s most important professor was the Ancient Historian Arnold Schäfer . For a while, he was a private tutor in Heppenheim to finance his studies, and then continued in Göttingen and Bonn, culminating in 1870 in a Dr.phil. (Ph.D.) in History and Epigraphy with a (published) dissertation entitled &quot;De gente Aetolica amphictyoniae participe&quot; . After spending some time as a gymnasium teacher and journalist, especially in Frankfurt where he was famous for his liberal, anti-Bismarck views, Bücher decided to opt for academe and took his Habilitation at the University of Munich .

In 1882 Bücher was elected by the faculty to an extraordinary professorship at the University of Erlangen, Bücher failed to receive Ministerial approval. However, he also received and accepted a call to a Chair at the University of Tartu (then &quot;Dorpat&quot;), the German-language university in the then Russian province of Livonia. The call enabled him to marry his fiancée at the time Emilie Mittermaier .

At Dorpat, Bücher held the Chair of Ethnography, Geography, and Statistics as successor of Wilhelm Stieda, concentrating almost exclusively on statistics. Here, he conceived &quot;newspaper science&quot; (&quot;Zeitungswissenschaften&quot;) as a new field of scholarship. On 17 August (29 August new-style) 1883, Bücher&#x27;s only son and child Friedrich, later a judge in Leipzig, was born. In the same year, Bücher received, and accepted out of family considerations, a call to the Chair of Economics and Statistics at the University of Basel as successor of Alphons Thun. He stayed there until 1890, during which time he developed a friendship with the historian and cultural philosopher Jakob Burckhardt. Bücher was elected President of the Statistical-Economical Association; his work was mainly Basel-focused and statistical. In Basel, he delivered the first lectures, also the first lectures in Europe at all, on &quot;newspaper science&quot; .

In 1889/90, Bücher accepts a call to the economics chair at the Technical Superior School in Karlsruhe, in the Grand Duchy of Baden, previously held by Eberhard Gothein .

The plan to call Bücher to the Chair of Economics at the University of Leipzig in the Kingdom of Saxony as successor of Lujo Brentano failed for political reasons; Bücher was still judged as too liberal. However, the University of Leipzig created a second chair in economics, with the addition of statistics. Bücher was suggested unanimously and without competition, and at the time received official approval .

His Leipzig tenure (1892–1916) was Bücher&#x27;s most fruitful time. In 1893, he published &quot;Die Entstehung der Volkswirtschaft&quot; (The Rise of the National Economy), his most important book, and the foundational study of non-market (exchange and gift) economics. The 17th and last edition of the original run appeared in 1926–1930; it was translated into French and English and went through six editions in America. In 1895, Bücher was elected corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Science, Historical Class. In 1896, &quot;Arbeit und Rhythmus&quot; (Labor and Rhythm) appeared; there are six editions until 1924. It was translated into Russian in 1899 and reprinted in 1923.

In 1901, Bücher became co-editor, with Albert Schäffle, then sole editor after 1904, of the eminent &quot;Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft&quot; (Magazine for All Political Sciences) established in 1844 as the first German economic journal of an academic standard and is still published today as &quot;The Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics&quot;. He edited this key journal of German economics and administration until 1924. In 1901/1902 he served as Vice Chancellor of the Faculty of Philosophy, in 1902/1903 as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy, and in 1903/04 as Rector of the University of Leipzig .

In 1916, based on his bad experience with press and propaganda during World War I, Bücher founded the &quot;Institut für Zeitungswissenschaften&quot; (Institute for Newspaper Science) at the University of Leipzig (after having established a departmental division already in 1915). It was the first institute of its type in Europe, and its founding marks the beginning of the academic study of media communication in Germany. Until 1926, Bücher headed the Institute and promoted the field, establishing it as a scholarly discipline in Germany with lasting results. In 1919, during the abortive German revolution, Bücher published a booklet about the socialization of factories as well as his highly successful autobiography, &quot;Lebenserinnerungen&quot; (Life Memories) .

Bücher was, for some time a member of the Leipzig City Council. Next to his earned doctorate, he received honorary ones of Law (Dr.jur.h.c.) from Gießen and of economics (Dr.rer.pol.) from Bonn. He was part of the Royal Saxon &quot;Geheimer Hofrat&quot; and a member of the &quot;Royal Saxon Academy&quot; .

<text>Ernst Louis Étienne Laspeyres (; 28 November 1834 – 4 August 1913) was a German economist. He was &quot;Professor ordinarius&quot; of economics and statistics or &quot;State Sciences&quot; and cameralistics (public finance and administration) in Basel, Riga, Dorpat (now Tartu), Karlsruhe, and finally for 26 years in Gießen. Laspeyres was the scion of a Huguenot family of originally Gascon descent which had settled in Berlin in the 17th century, and he emphasised the Occitan pronunciation of his name as a link to his Gascon origins.

==Work==
Laspeyres is mainly known today for his 1871 development of the index number formula method for determining price increases, used for calculating the rate of inflation. A type of this calculation is known today as the Laspeyres Index. In addition to his accomplishments in price indices, Laspeyres may be counted as one of the fathers of business administration as an academic-professional discipline in Germany, and as one of the main unifiers of economics and statistics by “developing ideas which are today by and large nationally and internationally reality: quantification and operationalization of economics; expansion of official statistics; cooperation of official statistics and economic research; and integration of the economist and the statistician in one person.” (Rinne 1983) In economics, Laspeyres was to some extent a representative of the Historical School and certainly of &quot;Kathedersozialismus&quot;.

The surname &quot;Laspeyres&quot; is of Gascon origin; his ancestors were Huguenots who settled in Berlin in the 17th century. How he pronounced his surname is uncertain, but likely as &quot;Las-pay-ress&quot;.

<text>John Cochrane (4 February 1798 – 2 March 1878) was a Scottish chess master and lawyer. After serving in the Royal Navy Cochrane chose to become a barrister. While studying law, he became a very strong chess player and published a book on the game, which included the Cochrane variation of the Salvio Gambit, a main line of the King&#x27;s Gambit. Around this time he played against the Frenchmen Deschapelles and Labourdonnais, who were acknowledged to be Europe&#x27;s strongest players at the time.

After a long tour of duty in India, he returned to the UK and beat everyone except Howard Staunton, whom he then helped to prepare for his victorious match against the Frenchman Saint-Amant, which established Staunton as the world&#x27;s leading player. Cochrane returned to India, where he became known as the &quot;Father of the Calcutta Bar&quot; (association of barristers) and a leading member of the Calcutta Chess Club; the Club and Cochrane personally both made significant financial contributions to the first international chess tournament, which Staunton organised. Cochrane continued to play chess and to send games to the UK for publication, mostly in Staunton&#x27;s columns. His two main opponents were Indians, and against one of them he made the first recorded use of the Cochrane Gambit against Petrov&#x27;s Defence. When he returned to the UK for good, Cochrane continued to practise law part-time, mainly in important cases that arose in India, and wrote articles and books about the law. By this time he was too old for serious chess competition but played many casual games with strong players.

Cochrane is credited with discovering the Cochrane Defense, a technique to draw the difficult endgame defence of a rook against a rook and bishop. Cochrane is known for his dashing playing style – liberally sacrificing pieces and always attacking. His best-known opening innovations are generally regarded as dubious, although the Cochrane Gambit is still occasionally used as a surprise weapon in master chess. Commentators during his life and after his death expressed strong affection for him.

==Biography==

Cochrane was &quot;a member of a distinguished Scottish family of which the Earl of Dundonald was the head&quot;. He was probably the son of John Cochrane, an army paymaster and merchant and the son of Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald. As a youth Cochrane was a midshipman in the Royal Navy, and is said to have served aboard HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; when the ship transported Napoleon Bonaparte to Britain in 1815. The downsizing of the Navy after the end of the Napoleonic Wars made promotion prospects poor, and Cochrane switched to a career as a barrister, apparently joining the Middle Temple without first attending a university.
While he was a student he first came to notice as a chess player. The first records of John Cochrane as a chess-player are five games (−3 =1 +1) played receiving the &quot;pawn and move&quot; from &quot;The Turk&quot; (operated, at the time, by Mouret) in 1819. In 1822 published &quot;A Treatise on the Game of Chess&quot;, of which the section on odds was based on the &quot;Traité des Amateurs&quot;, written by Verdoni, Bernard, Carlier and Leger. However Cochrane&#x27;s book contained significant amounts of his own analysis, including the Cochrane variation of the Salvio Gambit, a line in the King&#x27;s Gambit. It is known that Cochrane played against Deschapelles and Labourdonnais, who were acknowledged to be Europe&#x27;s strongest players from 1800 to 1820 and from 1820 to 1840 respectively; his games against them may have been played between 1822 and 1824, but by the time of Cochrane&#x27;s death commentators were unsure of the dates.

Soon after qualifying as a barrister, Cochrane decided to make his career in India. Before he left, however, he took a leading part for the London team in the early stages of a correspondence match against an Edinburgh team, which lasted from 1824 to 1828, and which the Edinburgh team won. The best-known game of this match was the second, in which, according to Howard Staunton, the London team obtained a winning position by following Cochrane&#x27;s plan, but blundered after his departure. In India Cochrane became a successful and respected barrister, and also lost no opportunity to play chess with other expatriates and with Indians.

By the early 1840s Cochrane had accumulated a lot of leave, and he spent 1841 to 1843 in the UK. Naturally he spent a lot of time at the top London chess clubs, where he beat almost everyone – including Pierre de Saint-Amant, who was France&#x27;s strongest player. However the rising star of British chess was Howard Staunton, who had been a schoolboy when Cochrane published his book. Staunton and Cochrane played at least 120 games on level terms, of which Staunton won about twice as many as Cochrane. Just before Cochrane&#x27;s return to India, Staunton began to give him the odds of Pawn and move, and in these games their scores were equal. Although Cochrane was annoyed with Staunton for under-representing Cochrane&#x27;s wins in his chess articles, he helped Staunton to prepare for his second match against Saint-Amant, which Staunton won and therefore was for several years regarded as the world&#x27;s strongest player.
Even after Cochrane returned to India, later in 1843, Staunton&#x27;s articles and books continued to publish Cochrane&#x27;s games, and contain most of the games by Cochrane that are still known about, whether played in England or India. It was Staunton who made British chess aware of how strong Cochrane was at his peak, and described him as &quot;Father of the English Chess School&quot;. During the second part of Cochrane&#x27;s career in India his main opponents were the Indian players Moheschunder Bannerjee and Saumchurn Guttack also known as Somacarana or Shyamacharan Ghatak. Cochrane&#x27;s first recorded use of the Cochrane Gambit against Petrov&#x27;s Defence was in a game against Bannerjee in 1848. Bannerjee&#x27;s fondness for fianchettoed openings, as reported by Cochrane, eventually led to the Indian defence class of openings. Another game, published in William Norwood Potter&#x27;s &quot;City of London Chess Magazine&quot; shows Bannerjee playing with the black pieces and beating Cochrane in a game that opened with the King&#x27;s Indian Four Pawns Attack. When Staunton organised the world&#x27;s first international chess tournament, the Calcutta Chess Club as a group made one of the largest donations to the tournament&#x27;s funds, and in addition its principal officers Cochrane and T.C. Morton made two of the largest personal contributions. During his second period in India Cochrane became known as the Father of the Calcutta Bar (local association of barristers). Staunton also published an incident in which Cochrane gave the whole of his fee for a case to a group of famine-stricken Indians
When Cochrane returned to the UK for good, he continued to work part-time as a barrister, arguing several Indian appeals before the UK&#x27;s Privy Council and writing legal treatises. His most important law book, the &quot;Defence of the Daya Bhaga&quot; (1872), was written in support of the native law of inheritance in Bengal. At the time of his death he was working on another law book. His enthusiasm for chess remained equally strong, although he restricted himself to casual games that typically lasted about 15 minutes – many of them with the veteran master Johann Löwenthal (1810–1876). He was a keen spectator at more serious contests and, as he was going deaf by this time, his comments on the play were often loud enough to be heard by players and amuse bystanders. He became known for his entertaining but always amiable conversation, and for the encouragement he gave to young players.

Cochrane was one of the earliest notable British chess masters, his playing career beginning during those of Jacob Henry Sarratt (1772–1819) and William Lewis (1787–1870). He played against Labourdonnais before anyone had heard of the Frenchman&#x27;s great opponent Alexander McDonnell, and was a successful writer about the game in 1822, when Howard Staunton was a schoolboy. In 1844 George Walker described Cochrane&#x27;s approach to the game:&quot;Mr. Cochrane is the most brilliant player I have ever had the honour to look over or confront; not even excepting De la Bourdonnais; and pity it is that his very brilliancy so often mars success.&quot; Cochrane was also a well-known chess theoretician, although his innovations in the openings were generally unsound, and only he could get away with playing them.
However the Cochrane Gambit still appears occasionally as a surprise weapon in serious competition, for example Veselin Topalov drew with it against Vladimir Kramnik at Linares in 1999. The Cochrane Defense is the method most often chosen by top-class players to draw in the endgame with a rook versus a rook and bishop.

<doc id="498773" wikidata="Q108126784" url="?curid=498773" title="Benzalkonium chloride">
<text>Benzalkonium chloride (BZK, BKC, BAK, BAC), also known as alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (ADBAC) is a type of cationic surfactant. It is an organic salt classified as a quaternary ammonium compound. ADBACs have three main categories of use: as a biocide, a cationic surfactant, and a phase transfer agent. ADBACs are a mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides, in which the alkyl group has various even-numbered alkyl chain lengths.

== Solubility and physical properties ==
Depending on purity, benzalkonium chloride ranges from colourless to a pale yellow (impure). Benzalkonium chloride is readily soluble in ethanol and acetone. Dissolution in water is ready, upon agitation. Aqueous solutions should be neutral to slightly alkaline. Solutions foam when shaken. Concentrated solutions have a bitter taste and a faint almond-like odour.

Standard concentrates are manufactured as 50% and 80% w/w solutions, and sold under trade names such as BC50, BC80, BAC50, BAC80, etc. The 50% solution is purely aqueous, while more concentrated solutions require incorporation of rheology modifiers (alcohols, polyethylene glycols, etc.) to prevent increases in viscosity or gel formation under low temperature conditions.

== Cationic surfactant ==
Benzalkonium chloride possesses surfactant properties, dissolving the lipid phase of the tear film and increasing drug penetration, making it a useful excipient, but at the risk of causing damage to the surface of the eye.
* Laundry detergents and treatments.
* Softeners for textiles.

== Phase transfer agent ==

Benzalkonium chloride is a mainstay of phase-transfer catalysis, an important technology in the synthesis of organic compounds, including drugs.

== Bioactive agents ==
Especially for its antimicrobial activity, benzalkonium chloride is an active ingredient in many consumer products:
* Pharmaceutical products such as eye, ear and nasal drops or sprays, as a preservative.
* Personal care products such as hand sanitizers, wet wipes, shampoos, soaps, deodorants and cosmetics.
* Skin antiseptics and wound wash sprays, such as Bactine.
* Throat lozenges and mouthwashes, as a biocide
* Spermicidal creams.
* Cleaners for floor and hard surfaces as a disinfectant, such as Lysol and Dettol antibacterial spray and wipes.
* Algaecides for clearing of algae, moss, lichens from paths, roof tiles, swimming pools, masonry, etc.
Benzalkonium chloride is also used in many non-consumer processes and products, including as an active ingredient in surgical disinfection. A comprehensive list of uses includes industrial applications.

During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, from time to time there have been shortages of hand cleaner containing ethanol or isopropanol as active ingredients. The FDA has stated that benzalkonium chloride is eligible as an alternative for use in the formulation of healthcare personnel hand rubs. However, in reference to the FDA rule, the CDC states that it does not have a recommended alternative to ethanol or isopropanol as active ingredients, and adds that &quot;available evidence indicates benzalkonium chloride has less reliable activity against certain bacteria and viruses than either of the alcohols.&quot; 

In November 2020 the &quot;Journal of Hospital Infection&quot; published a study on benzalkonium chloride formulations; it was found that laboratory and commercial disinfectants with as little as 0.13% benzalkonium chloride inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 virus within 15 seconds of contact, even in the presence of a soil or hard water. This resulted in a growing consensus that BZK sanitizers are just as effective as alcohol-based sanitizers despite the CDC guidelines. 

As a hand sanitizer, use of BZK may be advantageous over ethanol in some situations because it has significantly more residual antibacterial action on the skin after initial application. Benzalkonium chloride has demonstrated persistent antimicrobial activity for up to four hours after contact whereas ethanol-based sanitizer demonstrate skin protection for only 10 minutes post-application.

=== Medicine ===
Benzalkonium chloride is a frequently used preservative in eye drops. Typical concentrations range from 0.004% to 0.01%. Stronger concentrations can be caustic and cause irreversible damage to the corneal endothelium.

Avoiding the use of benzalkonium chloride solutions while contact lenses are in place is discussed in the literature.

Due to its antimicrobial activity when applied to skin, some topical medications for acne vulgaris have benzalkonium chloride added to increase the products&#x27; efficiency or shelf-life.

Benzalkonium chloride has also been shown to be a spermicide. In Russia and China, benzalkonium chloride is used as a contraceptive. Tablets are inserted vaginally, or a gel is applied, resulting in local spermicidal contraception. It is not a wholly reliable method, and can cause irritation.

=== Beekeeping ===
This chemical is used in beekeeping for the treatment of rotten diseases of the brood.

=== Adverse effects ===
Although historically benzalkonium chloride has been ubiquitous as a preservative in ophthalmic preparations, its ocular toxicity and irritant properties, in conjunction with consumer demand, have led pharmaceutical companies to increase production of preservative-free preparations, or to replace benzalkonium chloride with preservatives which are less harmful.

Many mass-marketed inhaler and nasal spray formulations contain benzalkonium chloride as a preservative, despite substantial evidence that it can adversely affect ciliary motion, mucociliary clearance, nasal mucosal histology, human neutrophil function, and leukocyte response to local inflammation. Although some studies have found no correlation between use of benzalkonium chloride in concentrations at or below 0.1% in nasal sprays and drug-induced rhinitis, others have recommended that benzalkonium chloride in nasal sprays be avoided. In the United States, nasal steroid preparations that are free of benzalkonium chloride include budesonide, triamcinolone acetonide, dexamethasone, and Beconase and Vancenase aerosol inhalers.

Benzalkonium chloride is an irritant to middle ear tissues at typically used concentrations. Inner ear toxicity has been demonstrated.

Occupational exposure to benzalkonium chloride has been linked to the development of asthma. In 2011, a large clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of hand sanitizers based on different active ingredients in preventing virus transmission amongst schoolchildren was re-designed to exclude sanitizers based on benzalkonium chloride due to safety concerns.

Benzalkonium chloride has been in common use as a pharmaceutical preservative and antimicrobial since the 1940s. While early studies confirmed the corrosive and irritant properties of benzalkonium chloride, investigations into the adverse effects of, and disease states linked to, benzalkonium chloride have only surfaced during the past 30 years.

== Toxicology ==
RTECS lists the following acute toxicity data:
Benzalkonium chloride is a human skin and severe eye irritant. It is a respiratory toxicant, immunotoxicant, gastrointestinal toxicant, and neurotoxicant.

Benzalkonium chloride formulations for consumer use are dilute solutions. Concentrated solutions are toxic to humans, causing corrosion/irritation to the skin and mucosa, and death if taken internally in sufficient volumes. 0.1% is the maximum concentration of benzalkonium chloride that does not produce primary irritation on intact skin or act as a sensitizer.

Poisoning by benzalkonium chloride is recognised in the literature. A 2014 case study detailing the fatal ingestion of up to 8.1 oz (240 ml) of 10% benzalkonium chloride in a 78-year-old male also includes a summary of the currently published case reports of benzalkonium chloride ingestion. While the majority of cases were caused by confusion about the contents of containers, one case cites incorrect pharmacy dilution of benzalkonium chloride as the cause of poisoning of two infants. In 2018 a Japanese nurse was arrested and admitted to having murdered approximately 20 patients at a hospital in Yokohama by injecting benzalkonium chloride into their intravenous drip bags.

Benzalkonium chloride poisoning of domestic pets has been recognised as a result of direct contact with surfaces cleaned with disinfectants using benzalkonium chloride as an active ingredient.

== Biological activity ==
The antimicrobial activity is dependent on the chain length. For example, yeast and fungi are most affected by C12, gram positive by C14, and gram negative by C16.

The greatest biocidal activity is associated with the C12 dodecyl and C14 myristyl alkyl derivatives. The mechanism of bactericidal/microbicidal action is thought to be due to disruption of intermolecular interactions. This can cause dissociation of cellular membrane lipid bilayers, which compromises cellular permeability controls and induces leakage of cellular contents. Other biomolecular complexes within the bacterial cell can also undergo dissociation. Enzymes, which finely control a wide range of respiratory and metabolic cellular activities, are particularly susceptible to deactivation. Critical intermolecular interactions and tertiary structures in such highly specific biochemical systems can be readily disrupted by cationic surfactants.

Benzalkonium chloride solutions are fast-acting biocidal agents with a moderately long duration of action. They are active against bacteria and some viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Bacterial spores are considered to be resistant. Solutions are bacteriostatic or bactericidal according to their concentration. Gram-positive bacteria are generally more susceptible than gram-negative bacteria. Its activity depends on the surfactant concentration and also on the bacterial concentration (inoculum) at the moment of the treatment. Activity is not greatly affected by pH, but increases substantially at higher temperatures and prolonged exposure times.

In a 1998 study using the FDA protocol, a non-alcohol sanitizer with benzalkonium chloride as the active ingredient met the FDA performance standards, while Purell, a popular alcohol-based sanitizer, did not. The study, which was undertaken and reported by a leading US developer, manufacturer and marketer of topical antimicrobial pharmaceuticals based on quaternary ammonium compounds, found that their own benzalkonium chloride-based sanitizer performed better than alcohol-based hand sanitizer after repeated use.

Newer formulations using benzalkonium blended with various quaternary ammonium derivatives can be used to extend the biocidal spectrum and enhance the efficacy of benzalkonium based disinfection products. Formulation techniques have been used to great effect in enhancing the virucidal activity of quaternary ammonium-based disinfectants such as Virucide 100 to typical healthcare infection hazards such as hepatitis and HIV. The use of appropriate excipients can also greatly enhance the spectrum, performance and detergency, and prevent deactivation under use conditions. Formulation can also help minimise deactivation of benzalkonium solutions in the presence of organic and inorganic contamination.. However, recent studies have demonstrated the capacity of environmental microorganisms to develop reduced susceptibility to benzalkonium chloride by employing strategies such as modifying bacterial membranes: increasing pump activity, and reducing the expression of certain porins.

== Degradation ==

Benzalkonium chloride degradation follows consecutive debenzylation, dealkylation, and demethylation steps producing benzyl chloride, an alkyl dimethyl amine, dimethylamine, a long chain alkane, and ammonia. The intermediates, major, and minor products can then be broken down into CO2, H2O, NH3, and Cl–. The first step to the biodegradation of BAC is the fission or splitting of the alkyl chain from the quaternary nitrogen as shown in the diagram. This is done by abstracting the hydrogen from the alkyl chain by using a hydroxyl radical leading to a carbon centered radical. This results in dimethylbenzylamine as the first intermediate and dodecanal as the major product.

From here, dimethylbenzylamine can be oxidized to benzoic acid using the Fenton process. The trimethyl amine group in dimethylbenzylamine can be cleaved to form a benzyl that can be further oxidized to benzoic acid. Benzoic acid uses hydroxylation (adding a hydroxyl group) to form p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Dimethylbenzylamine can then be converted into ammonia by performing demethylation twice, which removes both methyl groups, followed by debenzylation, removing the benzyl group using hydrogenation. The diagram represents suggested pathways of the biodegradation of BAC for both the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic regions of the surfactant. Since stearalkonium chloride is a type of BAC, the biodegradation process should happen in the same manner.

== Regulation ==
Benzalkonium chloride is classed as a Category III antiseptic active ingredient by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ingredients are categorized as Category III when &quot;available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required”.

In September 2016, the FDA announced a ban on nineteen ingredients in consumer antibacterial soaps citing a lack of evidence for safety and effectiveness. A ban on three additional ingredients, including benzalkonium chloride, was deferred at that time to allow ongoing studies to be completed.

Benzalkonium chloride was deferred from further rulemaking in the 2019 FDA Final Rule on safety and effectiveness of consumer hand sanitizers, &quot;to allow for the ongoing study and submission of additional safety and effectiveness data necessary to make a determination&quot; on whether it met these criteria for use in OTC hand sanitizers, but the agency indicated it did not intend to take action to remove benzalkonium chloride-based hand sanitizers from the market. There is acknowledgement that more data are required on its safety, efficacy, and effectiveness, especially with relation to:
* Human pharmacokinetic studies, including information on its metabolites
* Studies on animal absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
* Data to help define the effect of formulation on dermal absorption
* Carcinogenicity
* Studies on developmental and reproductive toxicology
* Potential hormonal effects
* Assessment of the potential for development of bacterial resistance
* Risks of using it as a contraceptive method.

However, recent studies have demonstrated the capacity of environmental microorganisms to develop reduced susceptibility to benzalkonium chloride by employing strategies such as modifying bacterial membranes: increasing pump activity, and reducing the expression of certain porins.

<doc id="498782" wikidata="Q4453869" url="?curid=498782" title="Aoimori Railway Line">
<text>The is a regional rail line in Aomori Prefecture, Japan that is operated by the Aoimori Railway Company. It connects the terminal station of the Iwate Galaxy Railway Line, Metoki Station, in the town of Sannohe to Aomori Station, the terminus of several rail lines in the city of Aomori. The Aoimori and Iwate Galaxy Railway Lines are former sections of the Tōhoku Main Line that connected Tokyo to Aomori that were rendered obsolete for long-distance passenger services by the completion of the high-speed Tōhoku Shinkansen between and stations. Though local passenger services are run on the line by the Aoimori Railway Company, the East Japan Railway Company continues to operate limited services, such as the sightseeing train &quot;Resort Asunaro&quot;, along the line, and the Japan Freight Railway Company (which owns a minority stake on the Aoimori Railway Company) transports freight along the line.

==History==

The predecessor to the Aoimori Railway Line was completed as the – portion of the Nippon Railway on 1 September 1891. When the Nippon Railway was nationalized on 1 November 1906, it became part of the Japanese National Railways (JNR) system and was designated part of the Tōhoku Main Line on 12 October 1909. With the privatization and dissolution of JNR on 1 April 1987, the line came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

On 1 December 2002, with the opening of the Tōhoku Shinkansen, the portion of the Tōhoku Main Line located in Iwate Prefecture became the Iwate Galaxy Railway Line, and the portion in Aomori Prefecture from the Iwate border to Hachinohe Station became the Aoimori Railway Line. With the opening of the Tōhoku Shinkansen extension to on 4 December 2010, the Tōhoku Main Line tracks between Hachinohe and Aomori were transferred from JR East to the Aoimori Railway Company, resulting in the completion of the Aoimori Railway Line.

There have been a few new developments along the line since its transfer to the Aoimori Railway Company. On 12 March 2012, Nonai Station was relocated southwest of its original location. Tsutsui Station, near Aomori High School, was opened on 15 March 2014. Two-car Aoimori 703 series sets began operations on the line on the same day to handle the increased loads presented by the opening of Tsutsui Station.

==Organization==
The Aoimori Railway Line is operated by the Aoimori Railway Company, a &quot;third-sector&quot; publicly and privately owned company. The railway facilities and tracks are owned by the prefectural government of Aomori as a &quot;Category 3 Railway Business&quot; under the Railway Business Act of Japan. The Aoimori Railway Company leases these facilities from the prefectural government and is responsible for operation of passenger trains on the tracks. This scheme is intended to mitigate the company&#x27;s burden as an owner of fixed assets and is known as .

The Aoimori Railway Line is designated as the rail line between Aomori and Metoki stations that was formerly the northernmost section of the Tōhoku Main Line. Trains operated by the Aoimori Railway Company primarily operate between Aomori and Hachinohe stations; however, some of the railway&#x27;s trains continue south beyond Hachinohe to Sannohe Station, with fewer continuing south to Morioka Station. Some of the trains that run along the railway between Hachinohe and Metoki Station are carried by the rolling stock of the Iwate Galaxy Railway Company, the operator of the former Tōhoku Main Line between Metoki and Morioka stations.

Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight), the nationwide freight train operator, continues to use the line for freight services. For maintenance work, the line relies on the services of the Hachinohe Rinkai Railway Company. As of January 2021, the only JR East limited express operate along the line is the &quot;Resort Asunaro&quot; sightseeing train that runs between and stations, using the line between Hachinohe and .

==Station list==
==Rolling stock and equipment==
* Aoimori 701 series 2-car EMUs x9
* Aoimori 703 series 2-car EMUs x2

The Aoimori Railway operates a fleet of 701 series two-car electric multiple units (EMUs). One set was built from new in September 2002, while eight more were transferred from JR East.

Two new two-car Aoimori 703 series EMUs were delivered in November 2013 and introduced from the start of the 15 March 2014 timetable revision.

==Future plans==

The railway has been negotiating with the city of Aomori since December 2015 on a proposal to open a new station between Tsutsui Station and Aomori Station near the point at which the railway passes under Japan National Route 103. The station would be part of a sports arena development for the 2025 National Sports Festival of Japan to be held in Aomori. The neighborhood the station would serve is a primarily residential area, but it would also provide access to some busy shopping centers within walking distance to the station. As of January 2021, no final decision has been made regarding the construction of the new station.

<text>Çorum () is a province in the Black Sea Region of Turkey, but lying inland and having more characteristics of Central Anatolia than the Black Sea coast. Its area is 12,428 km2, and its population is 524,130 (2022). Its provincial capital is the city of Çorum, the traffic code is 19.

==History==

Excavations reveal that Çorum area was inhabited during the Paleolithic, Neolithic period and the 4th stage of the Calcolithic Age. Remains of these periods have been found at Büyük Güllüce, Eskiyapar and Kuşsaray.

In later times Çorum and its environs were dominated by Hittites and in the district of Boğazkale is one of the most important Hittite sites in Anatolia, the UNESCO World Heritage listed Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite Empire from 1700 BC to 1200 BC. Other important Hittite sites include the open-air temples at Yazılıkaya and Alacahöyük; royal tombs; and the excavations of Boğazköy including tablets proving tradings links between the Hittites and the Ancient Egyptians.

Later civilizations such as the Phrygians arrived here and who left remains at Pazarlı, north of Çorum. Besides the Phrygians, the Cimmerians, Medes, Persians, Galatians, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuk Turks, Danishmends, Mongol Empire (Ilkhanids), Eretnids, Kadi Burhan al-Din and finally the Ottoman Empire also arrived here.

<doc id="498786" wikidata="Q5535906" url="?curid=498786" title="George (band)">
<text>George (stylised as george) were an Australian rock band from Brisbane, Queensland. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Polyserena&quot;, reached No. 1 on the Australian charts on 17 March 2002.

==Background==
For most of george&#x27;s career, the band consisted of Katie Noonan on vocals and keyboards, her brother Tyrone Noonan on vocals, guitar and keyboards, Geoff Green on drums and percussion, Paulie Bromley on bass guitar and Nick Stewart on guitar. Geoff Hooton, a bass guitar player, left the band in early 2000 and was replaced by Bromley. The band was originally founded by the Noonans, Stewart and Stewart&#x27;s twin brother James Stewart. The latter would leave the band early on, however, to pursue a career in acting.

The Noonans formed the nucleus of the band, doing most of the songwriting and lead vocals. Stewart also contributed to many of the band&#x27;s tunes. The Noonans grew up with a background in classical music; their mother, Maggie Noonan, is a well-known opera singer. Katie Noonan studied opera and jazz at the Queensland Conservatorium.

Stewart grew up listening to and playing rock music. Bromley played in the underground Brisbane rock band Pangaea with Ben Ely of Regurgitator. Green studied music at the Queensland University of Technology.

==History==
The band were formed in 1996 to enter a university music competition. They released a series of independent EPs, namely &quot;George&quot; in 1998, &quot;You Can Take What&#x27;s Mine&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Bastard Son/Holiday&quot; in 2000. &quot;Bastard Son/Holiday&quot; peaked at number 74 on the ARIA chart. The EPs did progressively better, earning good airplay on Triple J radio and community radio stations across Australia. George were also winning a strong live following throughout Australia.

George signed with Festival Mushroom Records in mid-2001. &quot;Special Ones&quot; was the first single released on Festival Records, followed by &quot;Run&quot; in October 2001 and &quot;Breathe in Now&quot; in February 2002. From this time the band toured heavily.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Polyserena&quot;, debuted at No. 1 on the national album charts in its first week; George became only the tenth Australian band to do this with a debut album. &quot;Polyserena&quot; was certified double platinum and spent 36 weeks in the top 50.

In January 2003, the band joined the Sydney Symphony Orchestra over two nights (23 and 25) to perform &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; by Jon Lord. The band is the only rock group other than Deep Purple to perform the piece. It was typical of the band&#x27;s eclectic approach combining classical, rock, funk, jazz and even electronic music.

George released the album &quot;Unity&quot; in February 2004 and it debuted at No. 5 on the Australian album chart of 1 March 2004. Katie Noonan said on the band&#x27;s website that the title reflected the band&#x27;s approach on the album. &quot;That family vibe brings a closeness and honesty that permeates what we do. Collectively and individually, we&#x27;ve been through a great period of change and growth. Knowing we can look to each other for strength brings comfort and solidarity. We have all been through the same thing and there&#x27;s an incredible sense of union from that experience - that&#x27;s what being in a band&#x27;s about.&quot;

George performed live in Brisbane on 22 December 2004. Following this, the band took a break while individual members attended to their own projects. While there were no immediate plans to regroup and perform, or to record new material, the band intended to make a comeback at some stage. The band reformed for a performance on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House on 27 January 2005.

In 2016, the band was announced to perform at Victoria&#x27;s Queenscliff Music Festival, the band&#x27;s first performance in 11 years. The band also put on a 20th-anniversary celebration at the Concert Hall, QPAC, during the Brisbane Festival on 9 September 2016. Following their performance at Taronga Zoo in 2017, the group once again folded and returned to their individual careers.

In 2021, the band announced a reunion to play a residency at the Brisbane Powerhouse to play &quot;Polyserena&quot; in its entirety.

The AeroDesign Team (ADT) is a student-led design team within the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. Founded in 1991, ADT&#x27;s purpose is to help students gain industry-like experience by competing in early design competitions that simulate typical design cycles in the Aerospace field. The team started out competing in the SAE AeroDesign contest but then switched its participation to the AIAA Design/Build/Fly (DBF) contest in 1997. The DBF contest has rules that change yearly, requiring students to come up with a completely new design each year. ADT won the DBF contest in 1998, 2009, 2014, and 2017. This is the second most first-place finish ever out of the 100+ universities from around the world that participate yearly.

===Associated Students of Biomedical Engineering===
Among the many organizations on campus, the &quot;Associated Students of Biomedical Engineering&quot; (&quot;ASBME&quot;) is an undergraduate student organization for biomedical engineering students at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. ASBME is a student-run undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineering organization at USC that serves the engineering student body through academic, social, and corporate events. Students gain clarity in their chosen field of study and the opportunities that being a BME major brings. Students are also able to get a foot in the corporate door at the annual ASBME corporate dinner, attended by USC alumni as well as other corporate representatives.

Activities consist of regular meetings with guest speakers and panels, the BIOMED Research Symposium, the annual Corporate Dinner and Networking Nights designed to foster relationships between graduating students and industry, and many other social, community, and corporate events.

ASBME serves as USC&#x27;s chapter of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) and sends some of its students to the annual BMES Conference each year.

===Pi Tau Sigma (Tau Beta chapter)===

Pi Tau Sigma is an international mechanical engineering honor society that strives to &quot;create better engineers through a commitment to academic excellence and dedication to service.&quot; The USC Tau Beta chapter is composed of the top mechanical engineers at the University of Southern California. USC&#x27;s Pi Tau Sigma engages in social, industry and community service-related events in the USC neighborhood and beyond. Paul Ronney serves as an advisor for the USC chapter of Pi Tau Sigma.

==Historical accomplishments==

In 1970, Neil Armstrong, who was the first person to set foot on the Moon, during the 1969 NASA Apollo mission, graduated USC with a master of science degree in aerospace engineering.

Equipped with the ability to adapt to arbitrary shapes without any external control, pioneering roboticist George Bekey co-created the world’s first five-fingered robot in 1977—the first able to give a true handshake.

In 1983, the internet&#x27;s pivotal Domain Name System (DNS) was invented by ISI researcher Paul Mockapetris. The DNS works as a phone book directory for the internet, automatically translating text addresses, which humans can understand and remember, to numerical addresses that computers can understand.

==Fundraising==

Previously known as the USC School of Engineering, it was renamed on March 2, 2004, as the Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering in honor of Qualcomm co-founder Andrew Viterbi and his wife Erna, who had donated $52 million to the school. The Viterbi School received other major gifts including gifts from Silicon Valley venture capitalist Mark Stevens who created the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation in 2004; real estate developer Daniel J. Epstein who named the Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering with an $11 million gift in 2002; Energy Corporation of America CEO John Mork who named the Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science with a $15 million gift in 2005; Ken Klein, CEO and president of Wind River Systems, who established the Klein Institute for Undergraduate Engineering Life with an $11 million gift, also in 2005; Ming Hsieh, founder of Cogent Inc., who named the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering in 2006 with a $35 million gift; and Los Angeles real estate developer Sonny Astani, who named the Sonny Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering with a $17 million gift in 2007.

<text>In quantum mechanics, the Gorini–Kossakowski–Sudarshan–Lindblad equation (GKSL equation, named after Vittorio Gorini, Andrzej Kossakowski, George Sudarshan and Göran Lindblad), master equation in Lindblad form, quantum Liouvillian, or Lindbladian is one of the general forms of Markovian master equations describing open quantum systems. It generalizes the Schrödinger equation to open quantum systems; that is, systems in contacts with their surroundings. The resulting dynamics are no longer unitary, but still satisfy the property of being trace-preserving and completely positive for any initial condition. 

The Schrödinger equation or, actually, the von Neumann equation, is a special case of the GKSL equation, which has led to some speculation that quantum mechanics may be productively extended and expanded through further application and analysis of the Lindblad equation. The Schrödinger equation deals with state vectors, which can only describe pure quantum states and are thus less general than density matrices, which can describe mixed states as well.

== Motivation ==
Understanding the interaction of a quantum system with its environment is necessary for understanding many commonly observed phenomena like the spontaneous emission of light from excited atoms, or the performance of many quantum technological devices, like the laser.

In the canonical formulation of quantum mechanics, a system&#x27;s time evolution is governed by unitary dynamics. This implies that there is no decay and phase coherence is maintained throughout the process, and is a consequence of the fact that all participating degrees of freedom are considered. However, any real physical system will interact with its environment, and is not absolutely isolated. The interaction with degrees of freedom that are external to the system results in dissipation of energy into the surroundings, causing decay and randomization of phase.

Certain mathematical techniques have been introduced to treat the interaction of a quantum system with its environment. One of these is the use of the density matrix, and its associated master equation. While in principle this approach to solving quantum dynamics is equivalent to the Schrödinger picture or Heisenberg picture, it allows more easily for the inclusion of incoherent processes, which represent environmental interactions. The density operator has the property that it can represent a classical mixture of quantum states, and is thus vital to accurately describe the dynamics of so-called open quantum systems.

==Definition==

=== Diagonal form ===
The Lindblad master equation for system&#x27;s density matrix can be written as (for a pedagogical introduction you may refer to)

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the anticommutator.

formula_3 is the system Hamiltonian, describing the unitary aspects of the dynamics.

formula_4 are a set of jump operators, describing the dissipative part of the dynamics. The shape of the jump operators describes how the environment acts on the system, and must either be determined from microscopic models of the system-environment dynamics, or phenomenologically modelled.

formula_5 are a set of non-negative real coefficients called damping rates. If all formula_6 one recovers the von Neumann equation formula_7 describing unitary dynamics, which is the quantum analog of the classical Liouville equation.

The entire equation can be written in superoperator form:formula_8which resembles the classical Liouville equation formula_9. For this reason, the superoperator formula_10 is called the Lindbladian superoperator or the Liouvillian superoperator.

=== General form ===
More generally, the GKSL equation has the form 

:formula_11

where formula_12 are arbitrary operators and is a positive semidefinite matrix. The latter is a strict requirement to ensure the dynamics is trace-preserving and completely positive. The number of formula_13 operators is arbitrary, and they do not have to satisfy any special properties. But if the system is formula_14-dimensional, it can be shown that the master equation can be fully described by a set of formula_15 operators, provided they form a basis for the space of operators. 

The general form is not in fact more general, and can be reduced to the special form. Since the matrix is positive semidefinite, it can be diagonalized with a unitary transformation :

:formula_16

where the eigenvalues are non-negative. If we define another orthonormal operator basis

:formula_17

This reduces the master equation to the same form as before:formula_18 
===Quantum dynamical semigroup===

The maps generated by a Lindbladian for various times are collectively referred to as a quantum dynamical semigroup—a family of quantum dynamical maps formula_19 on the space of density matrices indexed by a single time parameter formula_20 that obey the semigroup property
:formula_21
The Lindblad equation can be obtained by
:formula_22
which, by the linearity of formula_19, is a linear superoperator. The semigroup can be recovered as
:formula_24

===Invariance properties===

The Lindblad equation is invariant under any unitary transformation of Lindblad operators and constants,

:formula_25

and also under the inhomogeneous transformation

:formula_26
:formula_27

where are complex numbers and is a real number.
However, the first transformation destroys the orthonormality of the operators (unless all the are equal) and the second transformation destroys the tracelessness. Therefore, up to degeneracies among the , the of the diagonal form of the Lindblad equation are uniquely determined by the dynamics so long as we require them to be orthonormal and traceless.

===Heisenberg picture===

The Lindblad-type evolution of the density matrix in the Schrödinger picture can be equivalently described in the Heisenberg picture
using the following (diagonalized) equation of motion for each quantum observable :
:formula_28
A similar equation describes the time evolution of the expectation values of observables, given by the Ehrenfest theorem.
Corresponding to the trace-preserving property of the Schrödinger picture Lindblad equation, the Heisenberg picture equation is unital, i.e. it preserves the identity operator.

==Physical derivation==

The Lindblad master equation describes the evolution of various types of open quantum systems, e.g. a system weakly coupled to a Markovian reservoir.
Note that the appearing in the equation is &quot;not&quot; necessarily equal to the bare system Hamiltonian, but may also incorporate effective unitary dynamics arising from the system-environment interaction.

A heuristic derivation, &quot;e.g.&quot;, in the notes by Preskill, begins with a more general form of an open quantum system and converts it into Lindblad form by making the Markovian assumption and expanding in small time. A more physically motivated standard treatment covers three common types of derivations of the Lindbladian starting from a Hamiltonian acting on both the system and environment: the weak coupling limit (described in detail below), the low density approximation, and the singular coupling limit. Each of these relies on specific physical assumptions regarding, e.g., correlation functions of the environment. For example, in the weak coupling limit derivation, one typically assumes that (a) correlations of the system with the environment develop slowly, (b) excitations of the environment caused by system decay quickly, and (c) terms which are fast-oscillating when compared
to the system timescale of interest can be neglected. These three approximations are called Born,
Markov, and rotating wave, respectively.

The weak-coupling limit derivation assumes a quantum system with a finite number of degrees of freedom coupled to a bath containing an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The system and bath each possess a Hamiltonian written in terms of operators acting only on the respective subspace of the total Hilbert space. These Hamiltonians govern the internal dynamics of the uncoupled system and bath. There is a third Hamiltonian that contains products of system and bath operators, thus coupling the system and bath. The most general form of this Hamiltonian is

:formula_29

The dynamics of the entire system can be described by the Liouville equation of motion, formula_30. This equation, containing an infinite number of degrees of freedom, is impossible to solve analytically except in very particular cases. What&#x27;s more, under certain approximations, the bath degrees of freedom need not be considered, and an effective master equation can be derived in terms of the system density matrix, formula_31. The problem can be analyzed more easily by moving into the interaction picture, defined by the unitary transformation formula_32, where formula_33 is an arbitrary operator, and formula_34. Also note that formula_35 is the total unitary operator of the entire system. It is straightforward to confirm that the Liouville equation becomes

:formula_36

where the Hamiltonian formula_37 is explicitly time dependent. Also, according to the interaction picture, formula_38, where formula_39. This equation can be integrated directly to give

:formula_40

This implicit equation for formula_41 can be substituted back into the Liouville equation to obtain an exact differo-integral equation

:formula_42

We proceed with the derivation by assuming the interaction is initiated at formula_43, and at that time there are no correlations between the system and the bath. This implies that the initial condition is factorable as formula_44, where formula_45 is the density operator of the bath initially.

Tracing over the bath degrees of freedom, formula_46, of the aforementioned differo-integral equation yields

:formula_47

This equation is exact for the time dynamics of the system density matrix but requires full knowledge of the dynamics of the bath degrees of freedom. A simplifying assumption called the Born approximation rests on the largeness of the bath and the relative weakness of the coupling, which is to say the coupling of the system to the bath should not significantly alter the bath eigenstates. In this case the full density matrix is factorable for all times as formula_48. The master equation becomes

:formula_49

The equation is now explicit in the system degrees of freedom, but is very difficult to solve. A final assumption is the Born-Markov approximation that the time derivative of the density matrix depends only on its current state, and not on its past. This assumption is valid under fast bath dynamics, wherein correlations within the bath are lost extremely quickly, and amounts to replacing formula_50 on the right hand side of the equation.

:formula_51

If the interaction Hamiltonian is assumed to have the form

:formula_52

for system operators formula_53 and bath operators formula_54 then formula_55. The master equation becomes

:formula_56

which can be expanded as

:formula_57

The expectation values formula_58 are with respect to the bath degrees of freedom.
By assuming rapid decay of these correlations (ideally formula_59), above form of the Lindblad superoperator L is achieved.

==Examples==

In the simplest case, there is just one jump operator formula_60 and no unitary evolution. In this case, the Lindblad equation is

:formula_61

This case is often used in quantum optics to model either absorption or emission of photons from a reservoir.

To model both absorption and emission, one would need a jump operator for each. This leads to the most common Lindblad equation describing the damping of a quantum harmonic oscillator (representing e.g. a Fabry–Perot cavity) coupled to a thermal bath, with jump operators:

:formula_62

Here formula_63 is the mean number of excitations in the reservoir damping the oscillator and is the decay rate.

To model the quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with frequency formula_64 of the photons, we can add a further unitary evolution:

:formula_65

Additional Lindblad operators can be included to model various forms of dephasing and vibrational relaxation. These methods have been incorporated into grid-based density matrix propagation methods.

<doc id="498796" wikidata="Q16154735" url="?curid=498796" title="History of religion in the United States">
<text>Religion in the United States began with the religions and spiritual practices of Native Americans. Later, religion also played a role in the founding of some colonies, as many colonists, such as the Puritans, came to escape religious persecution. Historians debate how much influence religion, specifically Christianity and more specifically Protestantism, had on the American Revolution. Many of the Founding Fathers were active in a local Protestant church; some of them had deist sentiments, such as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington. Some researchers and authors have referred to the United States as a &quot;Protestant nation&quot; or &quot;founded on Protestant principles,&quot; specifically emphasizing its Calvinist heritage. Others stress the secular character of the American Revolution and note the secular character of the nation&#x27;s founding documents.

Protestantism in the United States, as the largest and dominant form of religion in the country, has been profoundly influential to the history and culture of the United States. African Americans were very active in forming their own Protestant churches, most of them Baptist or Methodist, and giving their ministers both moral and political leadership roles. The group often known as &quot;White Anglo-Saxon Protestants&quot; have dominated American society, culture, and politics for most of the history of the United States, while the so-called &quot;Protestant work ethic&quot; has long held influence over American society, politics, and work culture. In the late 19th and early 20th century, most major American Protestant denominations started overseas missionary activity. The &quot;Mainline Protestant&quot; denominations promoted the &quot;Social Gospel&quot; in the early 20th century, calling on Americans to reform their society; the demand for prohibition of liquor was especially strong. After 1970, the mainline Protestant denominations (such as Methodists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians) lost membership and influence. The more conservative Protestant evangelical, fundamentalist, and charismatic denominations (such as the Southern Baptists) grew rapidly until the 1990s and helped form the Religious Right in politics.

Though Protestantism has always been the predominant and majority form of Christianity in the United States, the nation has had a small but significant Catholic population from its founding, and as the United States expanded into areas of North America that had been part of the Catholic Spanish and French empires, that population increased. Later, immigration waves in the mid to late 19th and 20th century brought immigrants from Catholic countries, further increasing Catholic diversity and augmenting the number of Catholics substantially while also fomenting an increase in virulent American anti-Catholicism. At the same time, these immigration waves also brought a great number of Jewish and Eastern Orthodox immigrants to the United States. Protestantism in general (i.e. all of the Protestant denominations combined) remains by far the predominant and largest form of religion and the dominant and predominant form of Christianity in the United States, though the Catholic Church is technically the largest individual religious denomination in the United States if Protestantism is divided into its various denominations instead of being counted as a single religious grouping. Overall, roughly 43% of Americans identify as Protestants, with 20% identifying as Catholics, 4% identifying with various other Christian groups such as Mormonism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Oriental Orthodox Christianity, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses; and 2% identifying as Jewish. Hindus, Buddhists, and Muslims account for 1% each of the population.

As Western Europe secularized in the late 20th century, the United States largely resisted the trend, so that, by the 21st century, the US was one of the most strongly Christian of all major Western nations. Religiously-based moral positions on issues such as abortion and homosexuality played a hotly debated role in American politics. However, the United States has dramatically and rapidly secularized in recent years, with around 26% of the population currently declaring themselves &quot;unaffiliated&quot;, either in regard to a religion in general or to an organized religion.

==Demographics==
The US census has never asked Americans directly about their religion or religious beliefs, but it did compile statistics from each denomination starting in 1945.

Finke and Stark conducted a statistical analysis of the official census data after 1850, and Atlas for 1776, to estimate the number of Americans who were adherents to a specific denomination. In 1776, their estimate is 17%. In the late 19th century, 1850–1890, the rate increased from 34% to 45%. From 1890 –1952, the rate grew from 45% to 59%.

===Pew Forum data===
According to the Pew Research Center the percentage of Protestants in the United States has decreased from over two-thirds in 1948 to less than half by 2012 with 48% of Americans identifying as Protestant.

===Gallup data===
The data here comes from Gallup, which has polled Americans annually about their denominational preferences since 1948. Gallup did not ask whether a person was a formal member of the denomination. Blank means that there is no data available for a given year. All of the percentages here are rounded to the nearest percent, so 0% could mean any percentage less than 0.5%.

This decline in Protestant immigration has corresponded to the relaxation of immigration restrictions pertaining to mostly non-Protestant countries. The percentage of Catholics in the United States increased from 1948 all the way to the 1980s, but then began declining again. The percentage of Jews in the United States has decreased from 4% to 2% during this same time period. There has been very little Jewish immigration to the US after 1948 in comparison to previous years. The number of people with other religions was almost nonexistent in 1948, but rose to 5% by 2011, partially due to large immigration from non-Christian countries. The percentage of non-religious people (atheists, agnostics, and irreligious people) in the US has dramatically increased from 2% to 13%. The number of Americans unsure about their religion and religious beliefs has stayed roughly the same over the years, always hovering at 0% to 4%.

Over the last 19 years, some of the more traditional Protestant denominations and branches experienced a large decline as a percentage of the total American population. These include Southern Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and other Protestants. The only Protestant category that significantly increased its percentage share over the last 19 years is non-denominational Protestantism.

==Before European colonization==

===Native Americans===
Native American religions are the spiritual practices of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Traditional Native American ceremonial ways can vary widely, and are based on the differing histories and beliefs of individual tribes, clans and bands. Early European explorers describe individual Native American tribes and even small bands as each having their own religious practices. Theology may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof. Traditional beliefs are usually passed down in the forms of oral histories, stories, allegories and principles, and rely on face to face teaching in one&#x27;s family and community.

From time to time important religious leaders organized revivals. In Indiana in 1805, Tenskwatawa (called the Shanee Prophet by Americans) led a religious revival following a smallpox epidemic and a series of witch-hunts. His beliefs were based on the earlier teachings of the Lenape prophets, Scattamek and Neolin, who predicted a coming apocalypse that would destroy the European-American settlers. Tenskwatawa urged the tribes to reject the ways of the Americans: to give up firearms, liquor, and American-style clothing, to pay traders only half the value of their debts, and to refrain from ceding any more lands to the United States. The revival led to warfare led by his brother Tecumseh against the white settlers.

Native Americans were the target of extensive Christian missionary activity. Catholics launched Jesuit Missions amongst the Huron and the Spanish missions in California) and various Protestant denominations. Numerous Protestant denominations were active. By the late 19th century, most Native Americans integrated into American society generally have become Christians, along with a large portion of those living on reservations. The Navajo, the largest and most isolated tribe, resisted missionary overtures until Pentecostal revivalism attracted their support after 1950.

==Before the American Revolution==
The New England colonies were settled partially by English who faced religious persecution. They were conceived and established &quot;as plantations of religion.&quot; Some settlers who arrived in these areas came for secular motives—&quot;to catch fish&quot; as one New Englander put it—but the great majority left Europe to worship in the way they believed to be correct. They supported the efforts of their leaders to create &quot;a City upon a Hill&quot; or a &quot;holy experiment,&quot; whose success would prove that God&#x27;s plan could be successfully realized in the American wilderness.

===Puritans===
Puritanism was not a religion of its own, but rather was a movement, started in England, to reform Protestantism. However, the first Puritans in America who were called such have arrived between 1629 and 1640 and settled in New England, specifically the Massachusetts Bay area. These did not consider themselves completely separated from the English Church, however, and originally believed that they would one day return to purify England.

Puritans are often confused with a distinct, but similar sect of Protestants, called Separatists, who also believed that the Church of England was corrupt. However, Separatists believed that nothing more could be done to purify England itself. Separatists were persecuted, and their religion was outlawed in England, so they resolved to form a pure church of their own. One group of these, the Pilgrims, left England for America in 1620, originally settling in Plymouth, Massachusetts. These are the settlers who founded the tradition of Thanksgiving in America. They are also the group that many people attempt to pay homage to by dressing in dull colors and buckled hats. However, the Pilgrims did not actually dress as such.

Together, the Pilgrims and the Puritans helped to form the Massachusetts Bay Colony. While it is difficult to define a distinct time that Puritanism ended or a reason why it ended, one of the reasons most cited is that they became less committed to their religion. Also, while there is some disagreement on an exact end point, most sources agree that puritanism had declined by the beginning of the 18th century.

Puritans valued, among other things, soberness, diligence, education, and responsibility. They believed in predestination and were intolerant of all that they considered impure, including, but not limited to, Catholicism. While they intended to purify England, they nevertheless chose their ministers and members independently.

Puritan values may have had some influence on American ideals, such as individualism. For example, the puritan concept of justification-by-faith emphasized the personal values of the individual. Moreover, their physical break from the Church of England (although they did not consider themselves fully separate) proves their independence. The Pilgrims may have had an influence as well. In fact, upon their first arrival in America, the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact, a document which set up a government independent of England&#x27;s control (albeit, a temporary government) which could be thought of as a predecessor to the non-temporary Declaration of Independence.

===Establishment in the colonial era===
Early immigrants to the American colonies were motivated largely by the desire to worship freely in their own fashion, particularly after the English Civil War, but also religious wars and disputes in France and Germany. They included numerous nonconformists such as the Puritans and the Pilgrims, as well as Catholics (in Baltimore). Despite a common background, the groups&#x27; views on broader religious toleration were mixed. While some notable examples such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others such as the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches. The Dutch colony of the New Netherlands had also established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship, although enforcement by the Dutch West India Company in the last years of the colony was sparse. Part of the reason for establishment was financial: the established Church was responsible for poor relief, and dissenting churches would therefore have a significant advantage.

There were also opponents to the support of any established church even at the state level. In 1773, Isaac Backus, a prominent Baptist minister in New England, observed that when &quot;church and state are separate, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued.&quot; Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s influential Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was enacted in 1786, five years before the Bill of Rights.

Most Anglican ministers, and many Anglicans outside the South, were Loyalists. The Anglican Church was disestablished during the Revolution, and following the separation from Britain was reorganized as the independent Episcopal Church.

===Persecution in America===

Although they were victims of religious persecution in Europe, the Puritans supported the theory that sanctioned it: the need for uniformity of religion in the state.

Once in control in New England, they sought to break &quot;the very neck of Schism and vile opinions.&quot; The &quot;business&quot; of the first settlers, a Puritan minister recalled in 1681, &quot;was not Toleration, but [they] were professed enemies of it.&quot; Puritans expelled dissenters from their colonies, a fate that in 1636 befell Roger Williams and in 1638 Anne Hutchinson, America&#x27;s first major female religious leader.

Those who defied the Puritans by persistently returning to their jurisdictions risked capital punishment, a penalty imposed on the Boston martyrs, four Quakers, between 1659 and 1661. Reflecting on the 17th century&#x27;s intolerance, Thomas Jefferson was unwilling to concede to Virginians any moral superiority to the Puritans. Beginning in 1659, Virginia enacted anti-Quaker laws, including the death penalty for refractory Quakers. Jefferson surmised that &quot;if no capital execution took place here, as did in New England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or the spirit of the legislature.&quot;

Puritans also began the Salem Witch trials, named after the city that they were held in, Salem, Massachusetts. Starting with seizures of the local reverend&#x27;s daughter as well as her subsequent accusations, more than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft, and 20 were executed. The colony eventually realized that the trials were a mistake and tried to help the families of the convicted members.

====Founding of Rhode Island====
In the winter of 1636, former Puritan leader Roger Williams was expelled from Massachusetts. He argued for freedom of religion, writing &quot;God requireth not an uniformity of Religion to be inacted and enforced in any civill state.&quot; Williams later founded Rhode Island on the principle of religious freedom. He welcomed people of religious belief, even some he regarded as dangerously misguided, because he believed that &quot;forced worship stinks in God&#x27;s nostrils.&quot;

===Jewish refuge in America===
The first record of Jews in America cites their origin as passengers aboard the Dutch ship, St. Catrina. These records were kept by Jan Pietersz Ketel who was a skipper aboard the Peereboom, which was an Amsterdam ship that arrived near the same time as the St. Catrina. According to Jan Pietersz Ketel, 23 Jewish refugees, fleeing persecution in Dutch Brazil, arrived in New Amsterdam (soon to become New York City) in 1654. By the next year, this small community had established religious services in the city. Around 1677, a group of Sephardim had arrived in Newport, Rhode Island, also seeking religious liberty and, by 1678, they had purchased land in Newport. Small numbers of Jews continued to come to the British North American colonies, settling mainly in the seaport towns. By the late 18th century, Jewish settlers had established several synagogues.

===Quakers===
The Religious Society of Friends formed in England in 1652 around leader George Fox. Recently, church historians have debated whether Quakers may be regarded as radical Puritans since the Quakers carry to extremes many Puritan convictions. Historians in support of the Puritan classification of Quakers argue that Quakers stretch the sober deportment of the Puritans into a glorification of &quot;plainness.&quot; Theologically, they expanded the Puritan concept of a church of individuals regenerated by the Holy Spirit to the idea of the indwelling of the Spirit or the &quot;Light of Christ&quot; in every person.

Such teaching struck many of the Quakers&#x27; contemporaries as dangerous heresy. Quakers were severely persecuted in England for daring to deviate so far from orthodox Christianity. By 1680, 10,000 Quakers had been imprisoned in England and 243 had died of torture and mistreatment in jail.

This persecution impelled Friends to seek refuge in Rhode Island in the 1670s, where they soon became well entrenched. In 1681, when Quaker leader William Penn parlayed a debt owed by Charles II to his father into a charter for the province of Pennsylvania, many more Quakers were prepared to grasp the opportunity to live in a land where they might worship freely. By 1685, as many as 8,000 Quakers had come to Pennsylvania from England, Wales, and Ireland. Although the Quakers may have resembled the Puritans in some religious beliefs and practices, they differed with them over the necessity of compelling religious uniformity in society.

===Pennsylvania Germans===
During the main years of German emigration to Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century, most of the emigrants were Lutherans, Reformed, or members of small sects—Mennonites, Amish, Dunkers, Moravians, and Schwenkfelders. The great majority became farmers.

The colony was owned by William Penn, a leading Quaker, and his agents encouraged German emigration to Pennsylvania by circulating promotional literature touting the economic advantages of Pennsylvania as well as the religious liberty available there. The appearance in Pennsylvania of so many religious groups made the province resemble &quot;an asylum for banished sects.&quot;

===Catholics in Maryland===
For their political opposition, Catholics were harassed and had largely been stripped of their civil rights since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Driven by &quot;the sacred duty of finding a refuge for his Roman Catholic brethren&quot;, George Calvert obtained a charter from Charles I in 1632 for the territory between Pennsylvania and Virginia. This Maryland charter offered no guidelines on religion, although it was assumed that Catholics would not be persecuted in the new colony. His son Lord Baltimore, was a Catholic who inherited the grant for Maryland from his father and was in charge 1630–1645. In 1634, Lord Baltimore&#x27;s two ships, the &quot;Ark&quot; and the &quot;Dove&quot;, sailed with the first 200 settlers to Maryland. They included two Catholic priests. Lord Baltimore assumed that religion was a private matter. He rejected the need for an established church, guaranteed liberty of conscience to all Christians, and embraced pluralism.

Catholic fortunes fluctuated in Maryland during the rest of the 17th century, as they became an increasingly smaller minority of the population. After the Glorious Revolution of 1689 in England, the Church of England was legally established in the colony and English penal laws, which deprived Catholics of the right to vote, hold office, or worship publicly, were enforced. Maryland&#x27;s first state constitution in 1776 restored the freedom of religion. Maryland law remained a major center, as exemplified by the pre-eminence of the Archdiocese of Baltimore in Catholic circles. However, at the time of the American Revolution, Catholics formed less than one percent of the white population of the thirteen states. Religiously, the Catholics were characterized by personalism, discipline, and a prayer life that was essentially personal, demanding only a small role for priests and none for bishops. Ritualism was important, and focused on daily prayers, Sunday Mass, and observance of two dozen holy days.

===Virginia and the Church of England===
Virginia was the largest, most populous and arguably most important colony. The Church of England was legally established; the bishop of London who had oversight of Anglican in the colonies made it a favorite missionary target and sent in 22 clergymen (in priestly orders) by 1624. In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister. There was never a bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry consisted of laymen who controlled the parish and handled local taxes, roads and poor relief.

When the elected assembly, the House of Burgesses, was established in 1619, it enacted religious laws that made Virginia highly favor Anglicanism. It passed a law in 1632 requiring that there be a &quot;uniformitie throughout this colony both in substance and circumstance to the cannons and constitution of the Church of England.&quot;

The colonists were typically uninterested during church services according to the ministers, who complained that the people were not paying attention. The lack of towns meant the church had to serve scattered settlements, while the acute shortage of trained ministers meant that piety was hard to practice outside the home. Some ministers solved their problems by encouraging parishioners to become devout at home, using the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; for private prayer and devotion (rather than the Bible). This allowed devout Anglicans to lead an active and sincere religious life apart from the unsatisfactory formal church services. However, the stress on private devotion weakened the need for a bishop or a large institutional church of the sort Blair wanted. The stress on personal piety opened the way for the First Great Awakening, which pulled people away from the established church.

The Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and other evangelicals challenged behavior they saw as immoral and created a male leadership role that followed principles they saw as Christian and became dominant in the 19th century. Baptists, German Lutherans and Presbyterians funded their own ministers, and favored disestablishment of the Anglican church. The dissenters grew much faster than the established church, making religious division a factor in Virginia politics into the Revolution. The Patriots, led by Thomas Jefferson, disestablished the Anglican Church in 1786.

===Growth of Christianity in the 18th century===
Against a prevailing view that 18th-century Americans had not perpetuated the first settlers&#x27; passionate commitment to their faith, scholars now identify a high level of religious energy in colonies after 1700. According to one expert, Judeo-Christian faith was in the &quot;ascension rather than the declension&quot;; another sees a &quot;rising vitality in religious life&quot; from 1700 onward; a third finds religion in many parts of the colonies in a state of &quot;feverish growth.&quot; Figures on church attendance and church formation support these opinions. Between 1700 and 1740, an estimated 75–80% of the population attended churches, which were being built at a headlong pace.

By 1780, the percentage of adult colonists who adhered to a church was between 10 and 30%, not counting slaves or Native Americans. North Carolina had the lowest percentage at about 4%, while New Hampshire and South Carolina were tied for the highest, at about 16%.

Church buildings in 18th-century America varied greatly, from the plain, modest buildings in newly settled rural areas to elegant edifices in the prosperous cities on the eastern seaboard. Churches reflected the customs and traditions as well as the wealth and social status of the denominations that built them. German churches contained features unknown in English ones.

===Deism===
Deism is a philosophical and religious position that posits that God does not interfere directly with the world. These views gained some adherents in America in the late 18th century. Deism of that era &quot;accepted the existence of a creator on the basis of reason but rejected belief in a supernatural deity who interacts with humankind.&quot; A form of deism, Christian deism, stressed morality and rejected the orthodox Christian view of the divinity of Christ, often viewing him as a sublime, but entirely human, teacher of morality. The most prominent Deist was Thomas Paine, but many other founders reflected Deist language in their writings.

===First Great Awakening: emergence of evangelicalism===

In the American colonies the First Great Awakening was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants that swept the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American Christianity. It resulted from preaching that deeply affected listeners (already church members) with a sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ. Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made relationship with God intensely personal to the average person. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom sees it as part of a &quot;great international Protestant upheaval&quot; that also created Pietism in Germany, the Evangelical Revival and Methodism in England. It brought Christianity to enslaved people and was an apocalyptic event in New England that challenged established church authority. It resulted in division between the new revivalists and the old traditionalists who insisted on ritual and doctrine. The new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith changed Christian faith in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their relationship with God, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse. Ministers who used this new style of preaching were generally called &quot;new lights&quot;, while preachers who did not were called &quot;old lights&quot;. People began to study the Bible at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious manners and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the Reformation.

The fundamental premise of evangelicalism is the conversion of individuals from a state of sin to a &quot;new birth&quot; through preaching of the Bible leading to faith. The First Great Awakening led to changes in American colonial society. In New England, the Great Awakening was influential among many Congregationalists. In the Middle and Southern colonies, especially in the &quot;Backcountry&quot; regions, the Awakening was influential among Presbyterians. In the South Baptist and Methodist preachers converted both whites and enslaved Blacks.

During the first decades of the 18th century, in the Connecticut River Valley, a series of local &quot;awakenings&quot; began in the Congregational church with ministers including Jonathan Edwards. The first new Congregational Church in the Massachusetts Colony during the great awakening period, was in 1731 at Uxbridge and called the Rev. Nathan Webb as its Pastor. By the 1730s, they had spread into what was interpreted as a general outpouring of the Spirit that bathed the American colonies, England, Wales, and Scotland.

In mass open-air revivals, preachers like George Whitefield brought thousands of people to the new birth. The Great Awakening, which had spent its force in New England by the mid-1740s, split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches into supporters—called &quot;New Lights&quot; and &quot;New Side&quot;—and opponents—the &quot;Old Lights&quot; and &quot;Old Side.&quot; Many New England New Lights became Separate Baptists. Largely through the efforts of a charismatic preacher from New England named Shubal Stearns and paralleled by the New Side Presbyterians (who were eventually reunited on their own terms with the Old Side), they carried the Great Awakening into the southern colonies, igniting a series of the revivals that lasted well into the 19th century.

The supporters of the Awakening and its evangelical thrust—Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists—became the largest American Protestant denominations by the first decades of the 19th century. Opponents of the Awakening or those split by it—Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists—were left behind.

Unlike the Second Great Awakening that began about 1800 and which reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.

===Evangelicals in the South===
The South had originally been settled and controlled by Anglicans, who dominated the ranks of rich planters but whose ritualistic high church established religion had little appeal to ordinary men and women, both white and black.

====Baptists====
Energized by numerous itinerant missionaries, by the 1760s, Baptist churches started drawing Southerners, especially poor white farmers, into a new, much more democratic religion. They welcomed slaves to their services, and many slaves became Baptists at this time. Baptist services emphasized emotion; the only ritual, baptism, involved immersion (not sprinkling as in the Anglican tradition) of adults only. The Baptists enforced standards against sexual misconduct, heavy drinking, frivolous spending, missing services, cursing, and revelry, among other behaviors. Church trials took place frequently, and Baptist churches expelled members who did not submit to discipline.

Many historians have debated the implications of the religious rivalries for the coming of the American Revolution of 1765–1783. The Baptist farmers did introduce a new egalitarian ethic that largely displaced the semi-aristocratic ethic of the Anglican planters. However, both groups supported the Revolution. There was a sharp contrast between the austerity of the plain-living Baptists and the opulence of the Anglican planters, who controlled local government. Baptist church discipline, mistaken by the gentry for radicalism, served to ameliorate disorder. The struggle for religious toleration erupted and played out during the American Revolution, as the Baptists worked to disestablish the Anglican church.

Baptists, German Lutherans, and Presbyterians funded their own ministers, and favored disestablishment of the Anglican church.

====Methodists====
Methodist missionaries were also active in the late colonial period. From 1776 to 1815 ,Methodist Bishop Francis Asbury made 42 trips into the western United States to visit Methodist congregations. In the 1780s, itinerant Methodist preachers carried copies of an anti-slavery petition in their saddlebags throughout the state, calling for an end to slavery. At the same time, counter-petitions were circulated. The petitions were presented to the Assembly; they were debated, but no legislative action was taken, and after 1800, there was less and less religious opposition to slavery.

==American Revolution==
The Revolution split some denominations, notably the Church of England, whose clergy (priests often referred to as &#x27;ministers&#x27;) were bound by oath to support the king, and the Quakers, who were traditionally pacifists. Religious practice was reduced in certain places because of the absence of ministers and the destruction of churches.

===Church of England===
The American Revolution inflicted deeper wounds on the Church of England in America than on any other denomination because the English monarch was the head of the church. Church of England priests, at their ordination, swore allegiance to the British crown.

The Book of Common Prayer offered prayers for the monarch, beseeching God &quot;to be his defender and keeper, giving him victory over all his enemies&quot;, who in 1776 were American soldiers as well as friends and neighbors of American parishioners of the Church of England. Loyalty to the church and to its head could be construed as treason to the American cause.

Patriotic American members of the Church of England, loathing to discard so fundamental a component of their faith as the Book of Common Prayer, revised it to conform to the political realities. After the Treaty of Paris in which Great Britain formally recognized American independence, Anglicans were left without leadership or a formal institution. Samuel Seabury was consecrated bishop by the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1784. He resided in New York. After the requirement to take an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown two Americans were consecrated bishops in London in 1786 for Virginia and Pennsylvania. The Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States was created in 1787 as an autonomous in communion with the Church of England. It adopted a modified Book of Common Prayer which most notably used the Scottish Canon (Eucharistic Prayer). This consecration prayer moved the Eucharistic doctrine of the American Church much closer to the Catholic and Orthodox teachings and virtually undid Cranmer&#x27;s rejection of the Eucharist as a material sacrifice offered to God (which had been the accepted theology from the early 3rd century).

===Presbyterians===
Church of England leaders, who were primarily aligned with the Loyalist elements during the Revolution, often described the American Revolution as a &quot;Presbyterian Rebellion&quot; insofar as Presbyterians were their most outspoken opponents. This view was shared by King George III himself.

==American Revolution to Civil War==
Historians in recent decades have debated the nature of American religiosity in the early 19th century, focusing on issues of secularism, deism, traditional religious practices, and newly emerging evangelical forms based on the Great Awakening.

===Constitution===
The Constitution ratified in 1788 makes no mention of religion except in Article Six, where it specifies that &quot;No religious test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States&quot;. is allowed for federal office holders. Most colonies had a Test Act, and several states retained them for a short time. The Fourteenth Amendment later extended this prohibition to the states. However, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted in 1791, has played a central role in defining the relationship of the federal government to the free exercise of religion, and to the prohibition of the establishment of an official church. Its policies were extended to cover state governments in the 1940s. It states &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&quot; The two parts, known as the &quot;establishment clause&quot; and the &quot;free exercise clause&quot; respectively, form the textual basis for the Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretations of the &quot;separation of church and state&quot; doctrine. On August 15, 1789, Madison said, &quot;he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience...&quot; All states disestablished religion by 1833; Massachusetts was the last state. This ended the practice of allocating taxes to churches.

====Establishment Clause====
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution reads, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&quot; In a letter written in 1802, Thomas Jefferson used the phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; to describe the combined effect of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Though &quot;separation of church and state&quot; does not appear in the Constitution, it has since been quoted in several opinions handed down by the United States Supreme Court.

Robert N. Bellah has argued in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the United States, this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the United States. He used the term civil religion to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the United States. His 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of John F. Kennedy: &quot;Considering the separation of church and state, how is a president justified in using the word &#x27;God&#x27; at all? The answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension.&quot; 

This is not only the subject of a sociological discussion, but can also be an issue for atheists in America. There are allegations of discrimination against atheists in the United States.

===Jefferson, Madison, and the &quot;wall of separation&quot;===
The phrase a &quot;hedge or &quot;wall of separation&quot; between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world&quot; was first used by Baptist theologian Roger Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island. It was later used by Jefferson as a commentary on the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government, in an 1802 letter.

Jefferson&#x27;s and Madison&#x27;s conceptions of &quot;separation&quot; have long been debated. Jefferson refused to issue Proclamations of Thanksgiving sent to him by Congress during his presidency, though he did issue a Thanksgiving and Prayer proclamation as Governor of Virginia and vetoed two bills on the grounds they violated the first amendment.

After retiring from the presidency, Madison argued in his Detached Memoranda for a stronger separation of church and state, opposing the very presidential issuing of religious proclamations he himself had done, and also opposing the appointment of chaplains to Congress.

Jefferson&#x27;s opponents said his position meant the rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom

===Treaty of Tripoli===
The Treaty of Tripoli was a treaty concluded between the US and Tripolitania submitted to the Senate by President John Adams, receiving ratification unanimously from the US Senate on June 7, 1797, and signed by Adams, taking effect as the law of the land on June 10, 1797. The treaty was a routine diplomatic agreement but has attracted later attention because the English version included a clause about religion in the United States.

As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion,—as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims],—and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.Historian Frank Lambert says of the treaty: &quot;By their actions, the Founding Fathers made clear that their primary concern was religious freedom… Ten years after the Constitutional Convention ended its work, the country assured the world that the United States was a secular state&quot;

Notwithstanding the clear separation of government and religion, the predominant cultural and social nature of the nation did become strongly Christian. In the employment case of &quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot; (1892), the US Supreme Court stated, &quot;These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation.&quot;

===Great Awakenings and evangelicalism===

The &quot;Great Awakenings&quot; were large-scale revivals that came in spurts, and moved large numbers of people from unchurched to churched. The Methodists and Baptists were the most active at sponsoring revivals. The number of Methodist church members grew from 58,000 in 1790 to 258,000 in 1820 and 1,661,000 in 1860. Over 70 years, Methodist membership grew by a factor of 28.6 times when the total national population grew by a factor of eight times.

It made evangelicalism one of the dominant forces in American religion. Balmer explains that:
:&quot;Evangelicalism itself, I believe, is quintessentially North American phenomenon, deriving as it did from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain – warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans – even as the North American context itself has profoundly shaped the various manifestations of evangelicalism: fundamentalism, neo-evangelicalism, the holiness movement, Pentecostalism, the charismatic movement, and various forms of African-American and Hispanic evangelicalism.&quot;

====Second Great Awakening====

In 1800, major revivals began that spread across the nation: the Second Great Awakening in New England and the Great Revival in Cane Ridge, Kentucky. The principal religious innovation produced by the Kentucky revivals was the camp meeting.

The revivals at first were organized by Presbyterian ministers who modeled them after the extended outdoor communion seasons, used by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, which frequently produced emotional, demonstrative displays of religious conviction. In Kentucky, the pioneers loaded their families and provisions into their wagons and drove to the Presbyterian meetings, where they pitched tents and settled in for several days.

When assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. The religious revivals that swept the Kentucky camp meetings were so intense and created such gusts of emotion that their original sponsors, the Presbyterians, as well the Baptists, soon repudiated them. The Methodists, however, adopted and eventually domesticated camp meetings and introduced them into the eastern states, where for decades they were one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination.

The Second Great Awakening (1800–1830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. This revival quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Ohio. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. For example, the Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on ministers known as circuit riders, who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.

The Second Great Awakening exercised a profound impact on American religious history. By 1859 evangelicalism emerged as a kind of national church or national religion and was the grand absorbing theme of American religious life. The greatest gains were made by the very well organized Methodists. Francis Asbury (1745–1816) led the American Methodist movement as one of the most prominent religious leaders of the young republic. Traveling throughout the eastern seaboard, Methodism grew quickly under Asbury&#x27;s leadership into the nation&#x27;s largest and most widespread denomination. The numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative to that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period—the Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Reformed. Efforts to apply Christian teaching to the resolution of social problems presaged the Social Gospel of the late 19th century. It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the Latter Day Saint movement, the Restoration Movement, and the Holiness movement.

====Third Great Awakening====
The Third Great Awakening was a period of religious activism in American history from the late 1850s to the 20th century. It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism. It gathered strength from the postmillennial theology that the Second Coming of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth. The Social Gospel Movement gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the Holiness movement and Nazarene movements, and Christian Science.

The Protestant mainline churches were growing rapidly in numbers, wealth and educational levels, throwing off their frontier beginnings and become centered in towns and cities. Intellectuals and writers such as Josiah Strong advocated a muscular Christianity with systematic outreach to the unchurched in America and around the globe. Others built colleges and universities to train the next generation. Each denomination supported active missionary societies, and made the role of missionary one of high prestige. The great majority of pietistic mainline Protestants (in the North) supported the Republican Party, and urged it to endorse prohibition and social reforms. See Third Party System

The awakening in numerous cities in 1858 was interrupted by the American Civil War. In the South, on the other hand, the Civil War stimulated revivals and strengthened the Baptists, especially. After the war, Dwight L. Moody made revivalism the centerpiece of his activities in Chicago by founding the Moody Bible Institute. The hymns of Ira Sankey were especially influential.

Across the nation drys crusaded in the name of religion for the prohibition of alcohol. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union mobilized Protestant women for social crusades against liquor, pornography and prostitution, and sparked the demand for woman suffrage.

The Gilded Age plutocracy came under harsh attack from the Social Gospel preachers and with reformers in the Progressive Era who became involved with issues of child labor, compulsory elementary education and the protection of women from exploitation in factories.

All the major denominations sponsored growing missionary activities inside the United States and around the world.

Colleges associated with churches rapidly expanded in number, size and quality of curriculum. The promotion of &quot;muscular Christianity&quot; became popular among young men on campus and in urban YMCAs, as well as such denominational youth groups such as the Epworth League for Methodists and the Walther League for Lutherans.

===Benevolent and missionary societies===
Benevolent societies were a new feature of the American landscape during the first half of the 19th century. Originally devoted to converting nonbelievers, they eventually focused on the eradication of every kind of social ill. Benevolent societies were the direct result of the extraordinary energies generated by the evangelical movement—specifically, by the &quot;activism&quot; resulting from conversion. &quot;The evidence of God&#x27;s grace,&quot; Presbyterian evangelist Charles Grandison Finney insisted, &quot;was a person&#x27;s benevolence toward others.&quot;

The evangelical establishment used this powerful network of voluntary, ecumenical benevolent societies to Christianize the nation. The earliest and most important of these organizations focused their efforts on the conversion of nonbelievers or to the creation of conditions (such as sobriety sought by temperance societies) in which conversions could occur. The six largest societies in 1826–1827 were: the American Education Society, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, the American Tract Society, and the American Home Missionary Society.

Most denominations operated missions abroad (and some to Native Americans and Asians in the US). Hutchinson argues that the American desire to reform the secular world was greatly stimulated by the zeal of evangelical Christians. Grimshaw argues that women missionaries were enthusiastic proponents of the missionary endeavor, contributing, &quot;substantially to the religious conversion and reorientation of Hawaiian culture in the first half of the 19th century.&quot;

===Emergence of African American churches===

Scholars disagree about the extent of the native African content of Black Christianity as it emerged in 18th-century America, but there is no dispute that the Christianity of the Black population was grounded in evangelicalism.

The Second Great Awakening has been called the &quot;central and defining event in the development of Afro-Christianity.&quot; During these revivals Baptists and Methodists converted large numbers of Blacks. However, many were disappointed at the treatment they received from their fellow believers and at the backsliding in the commitment to abolish slavery that many white Baptists and Methodists had advocated immediately after the American Revolution.

When their discontent could not be contained, some black leaders formed new denominations. In 1787, Richard Allen and his colleagues in Philadelphia broke away from the Methodist Church and in 1815 founded the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, which, along with independent black Baptist congregations, flourished as the century progressed. By 1846, the AME Church, which began with eight clergy and five churches, had grown to 176 clergy, 296 churches, and 17,375 members.

==Civil War==
===Union===
The Protestant religion was quite strong in the North in the 1860s. The Protestant denominations took a variety of positions. In general, the pietistic or evangelical denominations such as the Methodists, Northern Baptists and Congregationalists strongly supported the war effort. More liturgical groups such as the Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans and conservative Presbyterians generally avoided any discussion of the war, so it would not bitterly divide their membership. Some clergymen who supported the Confederacy were denounced as Copperheads, especially in the border regions.

The churches made an effort to support their soldiers in the field and especially their families back home. Much of the political rhetoric of the era had a distinct religious tone. The interdenominational Protestant United States Christian Commission sent agents into the Army camps to provide psychological support as well as books, newspapers, food and clothing. Through prayer, sermons, and welfare operations, the agents ministered to soldiers&#x27; spiritual as well as temporal needs as they sought to bring the men to a Christian way of life.

No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the Methodist Episcopal Church. Historian Richard Carwardine argues that many Methodists felt that the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the persecutions of godly abolitionists, release from the Slave Power&#x27;s evil grip on the American government and the promise of a new direction for the Union. Methodists gave strong support to the Radical Republicans with their hard line toward the white South. Dissident Methodists left the church. During Reconstruction the Methodists took the lead in helping form Methodist churches for Freedmen and moving into Southern cities even to the point of taking control, with Army help, of buildings that had belonged to the southern branch of the church. The Methodist family magazine &quot;Ladies&#x27; Repository&quot; promoted Christian family activism. Its articles provided moral uplift to women and children. It portrayed the Civil War as a great moral crusade against a decadent Southern civilization corrupted by slavery. It recommended activities that family members could perform in order to aid the Union cause.

===Confederacy===
The CSA was overwhelmingly Protestant, and revivals were common during the war, especially in Army camps. Both free and enslaved populations identified with evangelical Protestantism. Freedom of religion and separation of church and state were fully ensured by Confederate laws. Church attendance was very high and chaplains played a major role in the Army.

The slavery issue had split the evangelical denominations by 1860. During the war, the Presbyterians and Episcopalians also split. The Catholics did not split. Baptists and Methodists together formed majorities of both the free and enslaved populations. Elites in the southeast favored the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America, which reluctantly split off the Episcopal Church (USA) in 1861. Other elites were Presbyterians belonging to the Presbyterian Church in the United States, which split off in 1861. Joseph Ruggles Wilson (father of President Woodrow Wilson) was a prominent leader. Catholics included an Irish working class element in port cities and an old French element in southern Louisiana.

==Since the Civil War==


Sidney Mead has argued organized religion met two great challenges in the late 19th century: the one to its social program, the other to its system of thought. Changing social conditions forced a shift from the &quot;Gospel of Wealth&quot; to the Social Gospel. the &quot;Gospel of Wealth&quot; was an appeal to rich Christians to share their wealth in philanthropy, while the Social Gospel called on ministers to take the lead themselves in eliminating social evils. The second challenge emerged from modern science, where Darwinian theory of evolution generated quite different religious responses among Christians in terms of biblical authoritarianism, Romantic liberalism, and modernism.

As a result, mainline Protestant churches gradually shifted towards Christian modernism, abandoning their emphasis on the individual salvation of the soul and laissez-faire individualism, although Christian fundamentalists resisted this tendency and sought to cling to the theological foundations of Christianity to which the denominations have arguably begun again to return.

Increasingly, the nation encountered new minority religions. According to historian R. Laurence Moore, Christian Scientists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Mormons, Pentecostals, and Roman Catholics responded to hostile comments by sensing themselves as persecuted Americans on the margins of society, which made them cling tightly to their status as full citizens.

===African-Americans in the Baptist Tradition ===
After the Civil War, Black Baptists desiring to practice Christianity away from racial discrimination rapidly set up several separate state Baptist conventions. In 1866, Black Baptists of the South and West combined to form the Consolidated American Baptist Convention. This Convention eventually collapsed but three national conventions formed in response. In 1895 the three conventions merged to create the National Baptist Convention. It is now the largest African American religious organization in the United States. The predominantly white denominations operated numerous missions to Blacks, especially in the South. Already before the Civil War Catholics had set up churches for Blacks in Louisiana, Maryland and Kentucky.

===The South===
Historian Edward Ayers describes an impoverished South with a rich spiritual life:
: Religious faith and language appeared everywhere in the New South. It permeated public speech as well as private emotion. For many people, religion provided the measure of politics, the power behind law and reform, the reason to reach out to the poor and exploited, a pressure to cross racial boundaries. People viewed everything from courtship to child-rearing to their own deaths in religious terms. Even those filled with doubt or disdain could not escape the images, the assumptions, the power of faith. The Baptists formed the largest grouping, for both Blacks and whites, with its loose networks of numerous small rural churches. In second place for both races came the Methodists, with a hierarchical structure at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Baptists. Smaller fundamentalist groups that grew very large in the 20th century were starting to appear. Clusters of Catholics appeared in the region&#x27;s few cities, as well as southern Louisiana. Elite white Southerners, for the most part, were Episcopalians or Presbyterians. Across the region, ministers held high prestige positions, especially in the black community where they were typically political leaders as well. When the great majority of Blacks were disenfranchised after 1890, the black preachers were still allowed to vote. Revivals were regular occurrences, attracting large crowds. It was usually the already converted who attended, so the number of new converts was relatively small but new or old, they all enjoyed the preaching and the socializing. Of course no liquor was served, for the major social reform promoted by the Southerners was prohibition; It was also the major political outlet for women activists, for the suffrage movement was weak.

===Missions to reservations===
Starting in the colonial era, most of the Protestant denominations operated missions to Native Americans. After the Civil War, the programs were expanded and the major Western reservations were put under the control of religious denominations, largely to avoid the financial scandals and ugly relationships that had previously prevailed. In 1869, Congress created the Board of Indian Commissioners and President Ulysses Grant appointed volunteer members who were &quot;eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy.&quot; The Grant Board was given extensive power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and &quot;civilize&quot; Native Americans. Grant was determined to divide Native American post appointments &quot;up among the religious churches&quot;; by 1872, 73 Indian agencies were divided among religious denominations. A core policy was to put the western reservations under the control of religious denominations. In 1872, of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received 14 reservations; the Orthodox Quakers ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Catholics seven; the Hicksite Quakers six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; the Disciples two; Unitarians two; American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions one; and Lutherans one. The selection criteria were vague and critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion. Catholics wanted a bigger role and set up the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions in 1874. The Peace Policy remained in force until 1881. Historian Cary Collins says Grant&#x27;s Peace Policy failed in the Pacific Northwest chiefly because of sectarian competition and the priority placed on proselytizing by the religious denominations.

===Catholic Church in the late 19th century===
The main source of Catholics in the United States was the huge numbers of European immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries, especially from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Poland. Recently, most Catholic immigrants come from Latin America, especially from Mexico.

The Irish came to dominate the church, providing most of the bishops, college presidents and lay leaders. They strongly supported the &quot;ultramontane&quot; position favoring the authority of the pope.

In the latter half of the 19th century, the first attempt at standardizing discipline in the church occurred with the convocation of the Plenary Councils of Baltimore. These councils resulted in the Baltimore Catechism and the establishment of The Catholic University of America.

In the 1960s, the church went through dramatic changes, especially in the liturgy and the use of the language of the people instead of Latin. The number of priests and nuns declined sharply as few entered and many left their vocations. Since 1990, scandals involving the coverup by bishops of priests who sexually abused young men has led to massive financial payments across the country, and in Europe and the world as well.

===1880s–1920s in benevolent and missionary societies===
By 1890, American Protestant churches were supporting about 1,000 overseas missionaries and their wives. Women&#x27;s organizations based in local churches were especially active in motivating volunteers and raising funds. Inspired by the Social Gospel movement to increased activism, young people on college campuses and in urban centers such as the YMCA contributed to a great surge that brought the total to 5000 by 1900. From 1886 to 1926, the most active recruiting agency was the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions (SVM), which used its base on campus YMCAs to appeal to enlist over 8,000 young Protestants. The idea quickly was copied by the new World&#x27;s Student Christian Federation (WSCF), with strength in Great Britain, and Europe, and even as far as Australia, India, China and Japan. Preliminary training at first focus on a deep understanding of the Bible; only later was it appreciated that effective missionaries had to understand the language and the culture. Important leaders included John Mott (1865–1955; the head of the YMCA), Robert E. Speer (1867–1947; the chief Presbysterian organizer; and Sherwood Eddy (1871–1963). Eddy, a wealthy young graduate of Yale College and Union Theological Seminary, concentrated on India. His base was the YMCA-organized Indian Student Volunteer Movement, focusing on the poor and outcasts. In 1911–31, he was secretary for Asia for the International Committee, splitting his energy between evangelistic campaigns in Asia and fund-raising in North America.

Mott promoted the YMCA across the United States and across the world. Its educational and sports programs proved highly attractive everywhere, but the response to religious proselytizing was tepid. Mott argued about China in 1910:
: It is Western education that the Chinese are clamoring for, and will have. If the Church can give it to them, plus Christianity, they will take it; otherwise they will get it elsewhere, without Christianity—and that speedily. If in addition to direct evangelistic and philanthropic work in China, the Church can in the next decade trained several thousands of Christian teachers, it will be in a position to meet this unparalleled opportunity.

With wide attention focused on the anti-Western Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901), American Protestants made missions to China a high priority. They supported 500 missionaries in 1890, more than 2,000 in 1914, and 8,300 in 1920. By 1927, they opened 16 universities in China, six medical schools, and four theology schools, together with 265 middle schools and a large number of elementary schools. The number of converts was not large, but the educational influence was dramatic and long-lasting.

===Laymen&#x27;s Report of 1932===
World War I reduced the enthusiasm for missions. Mission leaders had strongly endorsed the war; the younger generation was dismayed amid growing doubts about the wisdom of cultural imperialism in dealing with foreign peoples. In 1930–1932, Harvard Professor William Ernest Hocking led the Commission of Appraisal, which produced the Laymen&#x27;s Inquiry which recommended a shift on Christian missionary activities from evangelism to education and welfare.

===Social Gospel===
A powerful influence in mainline northern Protestant denominations was the Social Gospel, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with traces extending to the 21st century. The goal was to apply Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues of social justice and social evils such as economic inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, unclean environment, child labor, lack of unionization, poor schools, and the dangers of war. Theologically, the Social Gospelers sought to put into practice the Lord&#x27;s Prayer: &quot;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven&quot;. They typically were postmillennialist; that is, they believed the Second Coming could not happen until humankind rid itself of social evils by human effort. Social Gospel theologians rejected premillennialist theology, which held the Second Coming of Christ was imminent, and Christians should devote their energies to preparing for it rather than social issues. That perspective was strongest among fundamentalists and in the South. The Social Gospel was more popular among clergy than laity. Its leaders were predominantly associated with the liberal wing of the progressive movement, and most were theologically liberal. Important leaders included Richard T. Ely, Josiah Strong, Washington Gladden, and Walter Rauschenbusch. Many politicians came under its influence, notably William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson. The most controversial Social Gospel reform was prohibition, which was highly popular in rural areas – including the South – and unpopular in the larger cities where mainline Protestantism was weak among the electorate.

===Resurgence and retreat of fundamentalism===
In the 1920s, these &quot;strident fundamentalists&quot; devoted themselves to fighting against the teaching of evolution in the nation&#x27;s schools and colleges, especially by passing state laws that affected public schools. William Bell Riley took the initiative in the 1925 Scopes Trial by bringing in famed politician William Jennings Bryan as an assistant to the local prosecutor, Bryan drew national media attention to the trial. In the half century after the Scopes Trial, fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and they were generally defeated in their efforts to reshape the mainline denominations, which refused to join fundamentalist attacks on evolution. Particularly after the Scopes Trial, liberals saw a division between Christians in favor of the teaching of evolution, whom they viewed positively, and Christians against evolution, whom they viewed negatively.

Webb (1991) traces the political and legal struggles between strict creationists and Darwinists to influence the extent to which evolution would be taught as science in Arizona and California schools. After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought to pass similar anti-evolution laws in their states. They sought to ban the study of the theory of evolution, or at the very least, they sought to relegate evolution to the status of an unproven theory which could probably be taught along with the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen believed in the theory of evolution. Later, this struggle occurred in the Southwest more frequently than it occurred in other areas of the US, and it persisted through the Sputnik era.

===Decline in religiosity both before and during the Great Depression===
Robert T. Handy identifies a religious depression in the United States starting around 1925 that only grew worse during the economic depression which began in 1929. The identification of Protestantism with American culture undermined religious messages. The fundamentalist churches over-expanded and were financially troubled. The mainstream churches were well enough financed in the late 1920s, but lost their self-confidence in terms of whether their social gospel was needed in an age of prosperity, especially since the great reform of prohibition was a failure. In terms of their network of international missions, the mainstream churches realized that the missions were a success in terms of opening modern schools and hospitals but a failure in terms of conversions. The leading theorist Daniel Fleming proclaimed that the continents for Christian outreach and Christian conquest were no longer Africa and Asia, but rather, materialism, racial injustice, war and poverty. The number of missionaries from mainstream denominations began a steep decline. By contrast, the evangelical and fundamentalist churches—never wedded to the social gospel—escalated their efforts worldwide with a focus on conversion. At home the mainstream churches were forced to expand their charitable roles in 1929–31, but collapsed financially with the overwhelming magnitude of the economic disaster for ordinary Americans. Suddenly in 1932–33, the mainline churches lost one of their historic functions in distributing alms to the poor, and the national government took over that role without any religious dimension. Handy argues that the deep self-doubt the religious revivals customary in times of economic depression was absent in the 1930s. He concludes that Great Depression marked the end of the dominance of Protestantism in American life.

=== World War II===
In the 1930s, pacifism was a very strong force in most of the Protestant churches. Only a minority of religious leaders, typified by Reinhold Niebuhr, paid serious attention to the threats to peace posed by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, or militaristic Japan. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, practically all the religious denominations gave some support to the war effort, such as providing chaplains. The pacifist churches, such as the Quakers and Mennonites were small but maintained their opposition to military service. Many young members, such as Richard Nixon voluntarily joined the military. Unlike in 1917–1918, the positions were generally respected by the government, which set up non-combat civilian roles for conscientious objectors. Typically, church members sent their sons into the military without protest, accepted shortages and rationing as a war necessity, purchased war bonds, working munitions industries, and prayed intensely for safe return and for victory. Church leaders, however, were much more cautious while holding fast to the ideals of peace, justice and humanitarianism, and sometimes criticizing military policies such as the bombing of enemy cities. They sponsored 10,000 military chaplains, and set up special ministries in and around military bases, focused not only on soldiers but their young wives who often followed them. The mainstream Protestant churches supported the &quot;Double V campaign&quot; of the black churches to achieve victory against the enemies abroad, and victory against racism on the home front. However, there was little religious protest against the incarceration of Japanese on the West Coast or against segregation of Blacks in the services. The intense moral outrage regarding the Holocaust largely appeared after the war ended, especially after 1960. Many church leaders supported studies of postwar peace proposals, typified by John Foster Dulles, a leading Protestant layman and a leading adviser to top-level Republicans. The churches promoted strong support for European relief programs, especially through the United Nations. In one of the largest white Protestant denominations, the Southern Baptists, there was a new awareness of international affairs, a highly negative response to the axis dictatorships, and also a growing fear of the power of the Catholic Church in American society. The military brought strangers together who discovered a common Americanism, leading to a sharp decline in anti-Catholicism among veterans. In the general population, public opinion polls indicate that religious and ethnic prejudice were less prevalent after 1945, though some degree of anti-Catholic bias, anti-Semitism, and other discrimination continued.

===School prayer and the Supreme Court since 1947===
The phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; became a definitive part of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; (1947), a case that dealt with a state law that allowed government funds for transportation to religious schools. While the ruling upheld the state law allowing taxpayer funding of transportation to religious schools as constitutional, &quot;Everson&quot; was also the first case to hold the Establishment Clause applicable to the state legislatures as well as Congress, based upon the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

In 1949, Bible reading was a part of routine in the public schools of at least thirty-seven states. In twelve of these states, Bible reading was legally required by state laws; 11 states passed these laws after 1913. In 1960, 42 percent of school districts nationwide tolerated or required Bible reading, and 50 percent reported some form of homeroom daily devotional exercise.

Since 1962, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that prayers organized by public school officials schools are unconstitutional. Students are allowed to pray privately, and to join religious clubs after school hours. Colleges, universities, and private schools are not affected by the Supreme Court rulings. Reactions to &quot;Engel&quot; and &quot;Abington&quot; were widely negative, with over 150 constitutional amendments submitted to reverse the policy. None passed Congress. The Supreme Court has also ruled that so-called &quot;voluntary&quot; school prayers are also unconstitutional, because they force some students to be outsiders to the main group, and because they subject dissenters to intense peer group pressure. In &quot;Lee v. Weisman&quot; (1992), the Supreme Court held that:
:the State may not place the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting. Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially in matters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrassment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that the prayers are of a de minimis character, since that is an affront to ...those for whom the prayers have meaning, and since any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors&#x27; rights.

In 1962, the Supreme Court extended this analysis to the issue of prayer in public schools. In &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; (1962), the Court determined it unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools, even when it is non-denominational and students may excuse themselves from participation. As such, any teacher, faculty, or student can pray in school, in accordance with their own religion. However, they may not lead such prayers in class, or in other &quot;official&quot; school settings such as assemblies or programs.

Currently, the Supreme Court applies a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause, known as the &quot;Lemon Test&quot;. First, the legislature must have adopted the law with a neutral or non-religious purpose. Second, the statute&#x27;s principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.

===Debate over America as a &quot;Christian nation&quot;===
Since the late 19th century, some right-wing Christians have argued that the United States of America is essentially Christian in origin. They preach American exceptionalism, oppose liberal scholars, and emphasize the Christian identity of many Founding Fathers. Critics argue that many of these Christian founders actually supported the separation of church and state and would not support the notion that they were trying to found a Christian nation.

In &quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot;, a Supreme Court decision in 1892, Justice David Josiah Brewer wrote that America was &quot;a Christian nation&quot;. He later wrote and lectured widely on the topic, stressing that &quot;Christian nation&quot; was an informal designation and not a legal standard: &quot;[In] American life, as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs, and its society, we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth… this is a religious nation&quot;.

==Denominations and sects founded in the US==

===Restorationism===

Restorationism refers to the belief that a purer form of Christianity should be restored using the early church as a model. In many cases, restorationist groups believed that contemporary Christianity, in all its forms, had deviated from the true, original Christianity, which they then attempted to &quot;Reconstruct&quot;, often using the Book of Acts as a &quot;guidebook&quot; of sorts. Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as &quot;reforming&quot; a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as &quot;restoring&quot; the Church that they believe was lost at some point. &quot;Restorationism&quot; is often used to describe the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. The term &quot;Restorationist&quot; is also used to describe the Latter Day Saints and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witness Movement.

===Latter Day Saint movement===
The origins of another distinctive religious group, the Latter Day Saint movement—also widely known as Latter Day Saints or Mormons—arose in the early 19th century. It appeared in an intensely religious area of western New York called the burned-over district, because it had been &quot;scorched&quot; by so many revivals. Smith said he had a series of visions, revelations from God and visitations from angelic messengers, providing him with ongoing instructions as prophet, seer, and revelator and a restorer of the original and primary doctrines of early Christianity. After publishing the Book of Mormon—which he said he translated by divine power from a record of ancient American prophets recorded on golden plates—Smith organized the Church of Christ in 1830. He set up a theocracy at Nauvoo Illinois, and ran for president of the United States in 1844. His top aide Brigham Young campaigned for Smith saying, &quot;He it is that God of Heaven designs to save this nation from destruction and preserve the Constitution.&quot;

Latter Day Saints beliefs in theocracy and polygamy alienated many. Anti-Mormon propaganda was also common, as were violent attacks. The Latter Day Saints were driven out of state after state. Smith was assassinated in 1844 and Brigham Young led the Mormon Exodus from the United States to Mexican territory in Utah in 1847. They settled the Mormon Corridor. The United States acquired permanent control of this area in 1848 and rejected the Latter-day Saints&#x27; 1849 &quot;State of Deseret&quot; proposal for self-governance, instead establishing the Utah Territory in 1850. Conflicts between Latter-day Saints and territorial federal appointees flared, included the Runaway Officials of 1851; this eventually led to the small-scale Utah War of 1857–1858, after which Utah remained occupied by Federal troops until 1861.

Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862 to curb the Mormon practice of polygamy in the territory, but President Abraham Lincoln did not enforce this law; instead Lincoln gave Brigham Young permission to ignore the act in exchange for not becoming involved with the American Civil War.

Postwar efforts to enforce polygamy bans were limited until the 1882 Edmunds Act, which allowed for convictions of unlawful cohabitation, which was much easier to prosecute. This law also revoked polygamists&#x27; right to vote, made them ineligible for jury service, and prohibited them from holding political office. The subsequent 1887 Edmunds–Tucker Act disincorporated the LDS Church and confiscated church assets. It also: required an anti-polygamy oath for prospective voters, jurors and public officials; mandated civil marriage licenses; disallowed spousal privilege to not testify in polygamy cases; disenfranchised women; replaced local judges with federally appointed judges; and removed local control of schools. After a 1890 Supreme Court ruling found the Edmunds–Tucker Act constitutional, and with most church leadership either in hiding or imprisoned, the church released the 1890 Manifesto which advised church members against entering legally prohibited marriages. Dissenters moved to Canada or Mormon colonies in Mexico, or into hiding in remote areas. With the polygamy issue resolved, church leaders were pardoned or had their sentences reduced, assets were restored to the church, and Utah was eventually granted statehood in 1896. After the Reed Smoot hearings began in 1904, a Second Manifesto was issued which specified that anyone entering into or solemnizing polygamous marriages would be excommunicated, and clarified that polygamy restrictions applied everywhere, and not just in the United States.

Thanks to worldwide missionary work, the church grew from 7.7 million members worldwide in 1989 to 14 million in 2010.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses comprise a fast-growing denomination that has kept itself separate from other Christian denominations. It began in 1872 with Charles Taze Russell, but experienced a major schism in 1917 as Joseph Franklin Rutherford began his presidency. Rutherford gave new direction to the movement and renamed the movement &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses&quot; in 1931. The period from 1925 to 1933 saw many significant changes in doctrine. Attendance at their yearly Memorial dropped from a high of 90,434 in 1925 to 63,146 in 1935. Since 1950, growth has been very rapid.

During World War II, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses experienced mob attacks in America and were temporarily banned in Canada and Australia because of their lack of support for the war effort. They won significant Supreme Court victories involving the rights of free speech and religion that have had a great impact on legal interpretation of these rights for others. In 1943, the United States Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education vs. Barnette that school children of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses could not be compelled to salute the flag.

===Church of Christ, Scientist===
The Church of Christ, Scientist was founded in 1879, in Boston by Mary Baker Eddy, the author of its central book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, which offers a unique interpretation of Christian faith. Christian Science teaches that the reality of God denies the reality of sin, sickness, death and the material world. Accounts of miraculous healing are common within the church, and adherents often refuse traditional medical treatments. Legal troubles sometimes result when they forbid medical treatment of their children.

The Church is unique among American denominations in several ways. It is highly centralized, with all the local churches merely branches of the mother church in Boston. There are no ministers, but there are practitioners who are integral to the movement. The practitioners operate local businesses that claim to help members heal their illnesses by the power of the mind. They depend for their clientele on the approval of the Church. Starting in the late 19th century the Church rapidly lost membership, although it does not publish statistics. Its flagship newspaper &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; lost most of its subscribers and dropped its paper version to become an online source.

===Some other denominations founded in the US===
* Adventism - began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most vocal leader was William Miller, who in the 1830s in New York became convinced of an imminent Second Coming of Jesus.
* Churches of Christ/Disciples of Christ - a restoration movement with no governing body. The Restoration Movement solidified as a historical phenomenon in 1832 when restorationists from two major movements championed by Barton W. Stone and Alexander Campbell merged (referred to as the &quot;Stone-Campbell Movement&quot;).
* Episcopal Church - founded as an offshoot of the Church of England; now the United States branch of the Anglican Communion.
* National Baptist Convention - the largest African American religious organization in the United States and the second largest Baptist denomination in the world.
* Pentecostalism - movement that emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit, finds its historic roots in the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, California, from 1904 to 1906, sparked by Charles Parham
* Reconstructionist Judaism
* Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Baptist group in the world and the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, it renounced its 1845 origins in the defense of slavery and racial superiority.
* Unitarian Universalism - a theologically liberal religious movement founded in 1961 from the union of the well established Unitarian and Universalist churches.
* United Church of Christ - formed in 1957 as a united and uniting church from a merger of the Congregational Christian Church and Evangelical and Reformed Church. Congregations participating in the merger descended from Congregationalist churches of New England, German Lutheran and Reformed Churches largely from the Midwest, and various of Campbellite, Christian Connexion and &quot;Christian&quot; churches.
* Cumberland Presbyterian Church - founded in 1810 in Dickson County, Tennessee by Samuel McAdow, Finis Ewing, and Samuel King.

==Eastern Orthodoxy==
Eastern Orthodoxy reached to the North American continent with the founding of Russian America in the 1740s. After Russia sold Alaska in 1867 some of the missionaries remained.

In the 21st century Eastern Orthodox Christianity represents numerous adherents, religious communities, institutions and organizations. Most members are Russian Americans, Turkish Americans, Greek Americans, Arab Americans, Ukrainian Americans, Albanian Americans, Macedonian Americans, Romanian Americans, Bulgarian Americans and Serbian Americans, with some from other Eastern European countries.

==Judaism==
The history of the Jews in the United States comprises a theological dimension, with a three-way division into Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform. In social terms the Jewish ethnic community began with small groups of merchants in colonial ports such as New York City and Charleston. In the mid- and late-19th century well-educated German Jews arrived and settled in towns and cities across the United States, especially as dry goods merchants. From 1880 to 1924 large numbers of Yiddish-speaking Jews arrived from Eastern Europe, settling in New York City and other large cities. After 1926 numbers came as refugees from Europe; after 1980 many came from the Soviet Union, and there has been a flow from Israel. By the year 1900 the 1.5 million Jews residing in the United States were the third most of any nation, behind Russia and Austria-Hungary. The proportion of the population has been about 2% to 3% since 1900, and in the 21st century Jews were widely diffused in major metropolitan areas around New York or the Northeastern United States, and especially in South Florida and California.

==Islam==
The first migration of Muslims to America is estimated to be started since 1820 (or 1860), and these Muslims were from Syria, Lebanon, Albania, Macedonia, Turkey, and other regions. And from that time on, Islam became more widely known in America gradually. On the other hand, the record of the presence of the first Muslim person in America was mentioned in 1520 (by a Moroccan Muslim).

<text>Taejong (; 16 May 1367 – 10 May 1422), personal name Yi Bang-won (), was the third monarch of the Joseon dynasty of Korea and the father of Sejong the Great. He was the fifth son of King Taejo, the founder of the dynasty. Before ascending to the throne, he was known as Prince Jeongan ().

== Biography ==
=== Early life and founding of Joseon ===
Born in 1367 as the fifth son of Yi Sŏng-gye and his first wife Lady Han, Yi Pang-wŏn qualified as an official in 1382. He studied under Confucian scholars such as Wŏn Ch&#x27;ŏnsŏk. During his early years, he assisted his father in gathering the support of the commoners and of many influential figures in the government; Yi Pang-wŏn also helped in the founding of Joseon by assassinating powerful officials who remained loyal to Goryeo, most prominently Chŏng Mong-ju.

=== Strifes of Princes ===
After contributing heavily to the overthrowing of the previous dynasty and the establishment of Joseon, he expected to be appointed as successor to the throne. However, his father and Chief State Councillor Jeong Do-jeon favored Taejo&#x27;s eighth son and Yi Pang-wŏn&#x27;s youngest half-brother (second son of Queen Sindeok), Yi Bang-seok. This conflict arose chiefly because Jeong Do-jeon, as the principal architect of the ideological, institutional and legal foundations of the new dynasty, saw Joseon as a kingdom led by its ministers by virtue of the king&#x27;s appointment. In contrast, Yi Pang-wŏn sought direct rule through an absolute monarchy. These differences ultimately contributed to an environment of deep political tension.

In 1398, following the sudden death of Queen Sindeok, Yi Pang-wŏn led a coup d&#x27;état while King Taejo was still in mourning for his second wife. This event led to the deaths of Jeong Do-jeon and his supporters, as well as the deaths of the late Queen Sindeok&#x27;s two sons, including the crown prince. The incident became known as the &quot;First Strife of Princes&quot; (). Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the crown, and psychologically exhausted by the death of his second wife, Taejo abdicated; his eldest surviving son, Yi Pang-gwa (posthumously King Jeongjong), immediately became the new ruler.

Yi Pang-wŏn quickly emerged as the real force behind the throne and was soon in conflict with his disgruntled elder brother, Yi Pang-gan, who also yearned for power. In 1400, General Park Bo, who found the rewards for his deeds during the First Strife of Princes lacking, allied with Yi Pang-gan and rebelled in what came to be known as the &quot;Second Strife of Princes&quot; (). Yi Pang-wŏn successfully defeated his brother&#x27;s forces, then executed Park Bo and exiled Yi Pang-gan. King Jeongjong, now fearful of his formidable younger brother, named Yi Pang-wŏn his successor and abdicated in the same year. At long last, Yi Pang-wŏn (posthumously King Taejong), assumed the throne of Joseon and became the dynasty&#x27;s third monarch.

=== Reign ===
==== Consolidation of royal power ====
One of Taejong&#x27;s first acts as king was to abolish the privilege to maintain private armies which was enjoyed by the aristocracy and the upper echelons of the government. His revoking of the right to keep independent forces effectively severed the upper class&#x27; ability to muster large-scale revolts, and drastically increased the number of soldiers employed by the national army.

Taejong&#x27;s next act was to revise the existing legislation concerning land taxation. With the discovery of previously hidden land, national wealth increased twofold.

In addition, Taejong created a strong central government. In 1400, before taking the throne, he had played a key role in eradicating the , a branch of the old administration that had monopolized the executive power during the waning years of Goryeo, in favor of the Privy Council; during Taejong&#x27;s reign, the Privy Council was replaced by the State Council. Taejong also issued a decree according to which all decisions passed by the State Council could only come into effect with the approval of the king. This ended the custom of court ministers making decisions through debate and negotiations among themselves, and thus brought the royal authority to new heights.

Shortly thereafter, Taejong installed a new department known as the Sinmun Office, to hear cases in which aggrieved subjects felt that they had been exploited or treated unjustly by officials or aristocrats.

==== Reforms and policies ====
Despite being the one responsible for Chŏng Mong-ju&#x27;s assassination, Taejong posthumously honored him as Chief State Councillor, leading to a great irony — Chŏng To-jŏn, whose policies governed Joseon for five centuries, was vilified throughout the dynasty, while Chŏng Mong-ju was revered in spite of his opposition to its founding.

Taejong promoted Confucianism as the state ideology, thus demoting Buddhism, which consequently never recovered the glory and great power it had enjoyed during the Goryeo period. He closed many Buddhist temples; their vast possessions were seized and added to the national treasury.

In foreign policy, he was a straight hardliner — he attacked the Jurchens at the northern border and the Japanese pirates on the southern coast. Taejong is also remembered for being the initiator behind the Ōei Invasion of Tsushima Island in 1419.

He set up the system of &quot;hopae&quot;, an early form of identification which consisted of tags recording the bearer&#x27;s name and residence; those tags were used to control the movements of the population.

In 1403, Taejong ordered 100,000 pieces of metal type and two complete fonts. Predating Gutenberg and Laurens Janszoon by several decades, he accomplished the metal movable type.

He promoted press, commerce, and education, and also reformed the &quot;Sapyeongsunwibu&quot; (), Joseon&#x27;s early military and law enforcement agency, and separated the &quot;Uigeumbu&quot; as Joseon&#x27;s law enforcement agency but without military functions.

=== Later life and death ===
In 1418, Taejong abdicated in favor of his third legitimate son, Yi Do (posthumously King Sejong, commonly known as Sejong the Great), but continued to rule with an iron fist and decide on important matters.

Along the years, as a means to strengthen royal authority and subdue corruption, he executed or exiled some of the supporters who helped him ascend to the throne; he also executed the four brothers of his wife Queen Wongyeong, as well as Sejong&#x27;s father-in-law Shim On and his younger brother Shim Jeong, in order to limit the influence of in-laws and powerful clans.

King Taejong died four years after his abdication, on 10 May 1422, in Sugang Palace. He was buried alongside Queen Wongyeong at Heolleung (), part of the Heonilleung burial ground, in present-day Seocho District, Seoul, South Korea.

=== Legacy ===
Taejong remains a controversial figure in Korean history who eliminated many of his rivals (such as Chŏng Mong-ju and Chŏng To-jŏn) and yet ruled effectively to improve the populace&#x27;s lives, strengthen national defense, and lay down a solid foundation for his successor&#x27;s reign.

<text>As a result of the surrender and occupation of Japan at the end of World War II, the islands of Taiwan and Penghu were placed under the governance of the Republic of China (ROC), ruled by the Kuomintang (KMT), on 25 October 1945. Following the February 28 massacre in 1947, martial law was declared in 1949 by the Governor of Taiwan, Chen Cheng, and the ROC Ministry of National Defense. Following the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the ROC government retreated from the mainland as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) proclaimed the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). The KMT retreated to Taiwan and declared Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC. For many years, the ROC and PRC each continued to claim in the diplomatic arena to be the sole legitimate government of &quot;China&quot;. In 1971, the United Nations expelled the ROC and replaced it with the PRC.

In 1987, martial law was lifted and Taiwan began a democratisation process, beginning with the abolition of the Temporary Provisions and culminating with the first direct president election in 1996. By 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power and began to pursue Taiwanese independence and identity.

Due to Taiwan&#x27;s ambiguous political status, the ROC has participated in a number of international organizations under the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. Under its One-China policy, the PRC holds that the ROC ceased to exist and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the PRC despite the fact that it has never controlled the island. Moreover, the PRC refuses diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC. However, the ROC still controls Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, Lienchiang, and other minor islands.

== Chronology ==
=== Early postwar society ===
The Second World War&#x27;s hostilities came to a close on 2 September 1945, with the defeat of the Empire of Japan and Nazi Germany. Taiwan, which had been ceded to Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, was placed under the control of the Kuomintang-led Republic of China (ROC) by the promulgation of General Order No. 1 and the signing of the Instrument of Surrender on that day.

He Yingqin, the ROC representative at the Japanese surrender ceremonies, established the separate from the provincial-level executive system on mainland China. After the establishment of the provincial executive office, Chen Yi was appointed Chief Executive. Chen proclaimed 25 October to be Retrocession Day. However, because Japan had not formally relinquished the sovereignty of Taiwan at that time, Allies of World War II did not recognize the unilateral annexation of Taiwan by the Republic of China.

Chen Yi&#x27;s administration was marred by corruption, as well as a lack of discipline in the military police assigned to occupation duties, resulting in a severe undermining of the chain of command. With the rampant corruption in his administration, Chen Yi began to monopolize power. In addition to this, the island&#x27;s post-war economy was failing and headed into a recession, causing people on the island to endure economic hardship. The government&#x27;s program of &quot;De-Japanization&quot; also created cultural estrangement, along with tensions between the growing population of migrants from the mainland and the pre-war residents of the island. The building tensions erupted in 1947, when the arrest of a cigarette vendor by government agents led to the death of a bystander. The clashes between police and residents that followed quickly spread across the island, and grew into a general rebellion against Chen Yi and the Chief Executive&#x27;s Office in what came to be known as the February 28 incident. Several weeks later, government troops were sent to Taiwan from the mainland to handle the crisis and to suppress any opposition or resistance to the government. Many prominent individuals in Taiwanese society, as well as other residents of the island, many of whom had nothing to do with the incident, were either killed, imprisoned without trial, or simply disappeared. The February 28 Incident was a prelude to the White Terror of the 1950s, resulting in ethnic tensions between pre-war and post-war residents, as well as the genesis of the Taiwanese independence movement.

After the February 28 Incident, the Kuomintang-led ROC government reorganized the local government, abolishing the Chief Executive&#x27;s Office, while establishing a new provincial government. Wey Daw-ming, whose parents were scholars, became the first Governor of Taiwan Province and, during his administration, reduced the scope of the public enterprises, which had grown significantly under Chen Yi.

Wey was succeeded as governor by Chen Cheng in 1949. Wey reformed the currency system, replacing the devalued Old Taiwan dollar with the New Taiwan dollar, at a 40,000:1 exchange rate, and implemented the , easing the inflationary situation.

The KMT viewed the population of Taiwan as corrupted by Japanese influence and neither fully Chinese or fully trustworthy. This perceived influence led the KMT to believe that the population of Taiwan was backwards and required re-education. The KMT sought to remove any trace of Japanese influence and to force a full Chinese identity on the people of Taiwan.

After Japan&#x27;s surrender, most of Taiwan&#x27;s approximately 300,000 Japanese residents were expelled. The KMT also seized properties from Japanese colonists either for sale or for their own use. In modern Taiwan these appropriated properties are considered ill-gotten assets. The KMT also took assets which had belonged to the Japanese colonial authorities. In 2017 a court ordered the KMT to pay compensation for 458 properties which had been expropriated in this way.

=== Authoritarianism, martial rule and cold war ===


On 20 July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale assault on CCP territory in Huabei with 113 brigades (a total of 1.6 million troops), starting a new phase of the Chinese Civil War. Chen Cheng, who served as the chairman of Taiwan Provincial Government and commander of Taiwan Garrison Command, declared martial law on the island on 19 May 1949. A part of the Republic of China, Taiwan inherited the international pronouncement of the ROC government including the 1932 Note Verbale to France, where China declared that its southernmost territory was the Paracels.

In December 1949, the Republic of China Armed Forces and the Kuomintang were defeated in the Chinese Civil War, forcing the Government of the Republic of China to relocate to Taiwan. This allowed the CCP to declare the establishment of a new Chinese state: the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Following their retreat to Taiwan the KMT viewed their retreat as a temporary one with Chiang Kai-shek saying &quot;prepare for one year, counterattack in two years, sweep out the enemy in three years and succeed within five years.&quot; This led them to prioritize military armament and preparation over economic development.

After the February 28 Incident, the Nationalist government launched a campaign of suppression against political dissents. The KMT mostly imprisoned Taiwan&#x27;s intellectual and social elite out of fear that they might resist their rule or sympathize with communism.

Up and until 1958, small-scale military campaigns between the ROC forces and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) were carried out across the strait. An attempt by the CCP government to take the ROC-controlled island of Quemoy was thwarted in October 1949, halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan.

In April 1950, amphibious operations were successful in conquering Hainan Island in April 1950, leading to the capture of Wanshan Islands off the Guangdong coast (May–August 1950) and Zhoushan Island off Zhejiang (May 1950).

This period of tension lasted until the Second Strait Crisis, in which the United States pledged to protect the island from the mainland. From that point on, both sides of the strait have ceased all major hostilities against each other, with the ROC Navy having resumed unilateral combat and escort duties while the US Navy secretly and quietly removed their extra warships from the Taiwan Strait.

=== Democratic reforms ===

The Republic of China entered into the development phase of constitutional democracy with the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947. Subsequently, the National Revolutionary Army was also renamed as Republic of China Armed Forces and was nationalized. However, due to the Chinese Civil War, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion were passed as an amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China. This established martial law in Taiwan and curtailed civil liberties and democracy. The official rationale for the Provisions was the ongoing Chinese Civil War and ROC was effectively under the military rule of the KMT during the period of mobilization. Taiwan was effectively under martial law.

However, with the demise of the KMT single-party system and democratization movement during the 1980s, martial law was eventually lifted in 1987 (and its provisions were eventually rescinded in 1991). Constitutional democracy was restored in ROC after 1987.

When the Republic of China relocated to Taiwan in 1949, the Chinese Youth Party, China Democratic Socialist Party, and KMT were the only legal political parties in Taiwan. The other established parties operated under the Tangwai movement.

Until the early 1970s, the Republic of China was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations, which refused to recognize the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) on account of the Cold War. The KMT rule of Taiwan under martial law until the late 1980s had the stated goals of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated.

The late 1970s and early 1980s were a turbulent time for the Taiwan-born as many of the people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of Taiwan&#x27;s new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for respect for their basic human rights. The Kaohsiung Incident would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan.

Taiwan also faced setbacks in the international sphere. In 1971, the ROC government walked out of the United Nations shortly before it recognized the PRC government in Beijing as the legitimate holder of China&#x27;s seat in the United Nations. The ROC had been offered dual representation, but Chiang Kai-shek demanded to retain a seat on the UN Security Council, which was not acceptable to the PRC. Chiang expressed his decision in his famous &quot;the sky is not big enough for two suns&quot; speech. In October 1971, Resolution 2758 was passed by the UN General Assembly and &quot;the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek&quot; (and thus the ROC) were expelled from the UN and replaced as &quot;China&quot; by the PRC. In 1979, the United States switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing.

Chiang Kai-shek died in April 1975 at the age of 87, and was succeeded in the presidency by Yen Chia-kan while his son Chiang Ching-kuo succeeded to the leadership of the Kuomintang (opting to take the title &quot;Chairman&quot; rather than the elder Chiang&#x27;s title of &quot;Director-General&quot;). Formerly the head of the feared secret police, Chiang Ching-kuo recognized gaining foreign support to securing the ROC&#x27;s future security required reform. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls, a transition towards democracy, and moves toward Taiwanization of the regime. Opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish papers. Though opposition political parties were still illegal, when the Democratic Progressive Party was established as the first opposition party in 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders. Its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the Tangwai movement. In the following year, Chiang ended martial law and allowed family visits to mainland China.

Chiang selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwan born technocrat to be his vice president, first in the line of succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving more power to native-born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments during a period in which many other Asian autocracies were being challenged.

After Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, his successor, President Lee Teng-hui, continued to democratize the government. Lee transferred more government authority to Taiwanese-born citizens, and Taiwan underwent a process of localization. In this localization process, local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee&#x27;s reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank instead of the usual Provincial Bank of Taiwan. He also largely suspended the operation of the Taiwan Provincial Government. In 1991 the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly, elected in 1947, were forced to resign. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. Also lifted were the restrictions on the use of Taiwanese languages in the broadcast media and in schools. Lee Teng-hui believed that agriculture was the backbone of a nation and promoted it extensively. He implemented health insurance and occupational hazard insurance programs for farmers. He also emphasized the Japanese roots of much of Taiwan&#x27;s agricultural infrastructure.

Attempting to maintain good relations with the PRC, Taiwan avoided any criticism of the Tiananmen Square Massacre and the media was largely barred from reporting on it. A group of students who attempted to sail a chartered ship into the Formosa Strait and beam pro-democracy broadcasts into China via amateur radio were foiled by the government by putting various obstacles in their way that caused them to abandon the attempt.

However, Lee failed to crack down on the massive corruption that pervaded the government and many KMT loyalists felt that Lee betrayed the ROC by taking reforms too far, while those in the opposition felt he did not take reforms far enough.

=== Democratic period ===
Lee ran as the incumbent in Taiwan&#x27;s first direct presidential election in 1996 against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Min-ming. This election prompted the PRC to conduct a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate so that electorates would vote for pro-unification candidates, Chen Li-an and Lin Yang-kang. The aggressive tactic prompted U.S. President Clinton to invoke the Taiwan Relations Act and dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups into the region off Taiwan&#x27;s southern coast to monitor the situation, and PRC&#x27;s missile tests were forced to end earlier than planned. This incident is known as the 1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis.

One of Lee&#x27;s final acts as president was to declare on German radio that the ROC and the PRC have a special state-to-state relationship. Lee&#x27;s statement was met with the PLA conducting military drills in Fujian and a frightening island-wide blackout in Taiwan, causing many to fear an attack.

The 2000 presidential election marked the end of the Kuomintang&#x27;s status as the ruling party. The DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian was elected president with Annette Lu as vice-president, after a three-way race that saw the Pan-Blue vote split by independent James Soong (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan. Chen garnered 39% of the vote. After the election, Soong formed the People First Party (PFP).

In August 2002, President Chen openly indicated that the relationship between Taiwan and the mainland is &quot;One Country on Each Side&quot;. This declaration led to disputations throughout Taiwan, in mainland China and in the United States. In 2004, the day before the 2004 presidential election, there was a supposed assassination attempt on President Chen and Vice-president Lu. They were re-elected the next day, although the Pan-Blue Coalition disputed the legality of the result due to the close margin of the election and the shooting incident. In 2005, an ad hoc National Assembly passed constitutional amendments ruling that elections for the Legislative Yuan change to use of parallel voting, aiding the formation of a two-party system. As a result of scandals in the DPP administration, on 9 September 2006, former chairperson of the DPP, Shih Ming-teh, led an anti-Chen Shui-bian campaign called the Million Voices Against Corruption, President Chen Must Go but did not achieve the desired result of President Chen&#x27;s resignation. 

The KMT also retained control of the legislature in the Legislative Yuan elections in January 2008. In the presidential election in May 2008, KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou ran on a platform supporting friendlier relations with mainland China and economic reforms and defeated DPP candidate Frank Hsieh with 58.48% of the vote.

Ma was re-elected, and the KMT retained its majority in the Legislative Yuan, in combined elections in January 2012. In the 2016 elections, the DPP regained power with Tsai Ing-wen becoming Taiwan&#x27;s first female president.

On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples have a right to marry, and gave the Legislature Yuan two years to adequately amend Taiwanese marriage laws. According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal. In effect, Taiwan (ROC) became the first country in Asia and the first non-UN sovereign state to allow same-sex marriage in May 2019.

The local elections held on November 24, 2018, resulted in a major setback for the DPP majority and led to President Tsai Ing-wen resignation as leader of the party. The DPP lost a total of nine legislative seats, giving the KMT control of the majority of the 22 seats. KMT mayoral candidates won in New Taipei City, Taichung and Kaohsiung, the latter of which has been a political stronghold for the DPP for 20 years.

In May 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.

In January 2020, Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected in the presidential election. In the parliamentary election President Tsai&#x27;s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won majority 61 out of 113 seats. The Kuomintang (KMT) won 38 seats.

The 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan resulted in increased tensions between Taiwan and China while reinforcing US-Taiwan ties. In response to the trip the PLA conducted military exercises around Taiwan, included missile launches which overflew Taiwan.

In January 2024, William Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party won Taiwan&#x27;s presidential elections. However, for the first time since 2004, no party won a majority in the simultaneous legislative election. Instead, 51 seats were secured by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), 52 seats by the Kuomintang (KMT), and the Taiwan People&#x27;s Party (TPP) secured eight seats.

== Cross-straits relations and international position ==
At the end of 1943, the Cairo Declaration was issued, including among its clauses that all territories of China, including Formosa (Taiwan), that Japan had occupied would be returned to Republic of China. This declaration was reiterated in the Potsdam Declaration, issued in 1945. Later that year, World War II ended, and Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, surrendering unconditionally. The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces commanded that the Japanese forces in Taiwan surrender to the government of the Republic of China, which acted as the representative of the Allied Forces. On 25 October 1945 in Taipei Zhongshan Hall, the Japanese government in Taiwan surrendered to the representative of the Republic of China, Chen Yi, the Republic of China formally receiving Taiwan. In 1951, Japan formally signed the Treaty of San Francisco, but, due to the unclear situation of the Chinese civil war, the peace treaty did not clearly indicate to whom Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty belonged. In the second article of the 1952 Treaty of Taipei, following the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan reiterated its abandonment of sovereignty of Taiwan, the Pescadores, the Spratlys and the Paracels.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) continued a state of war until 1979. In October 1949 a PRC attempt to take the ROC controlled island of Kinmen was thwarted in the Battle of Kuningtou halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan. The Communists&#x27; other amphibious operations of 1950 were more successful: they led to the Communist conquest of Hainan Island in April 1950, capture of Wanshan Islands off the Guangdong coast (May–August 1950) and of Zhoushan Island off Zhejiang (May 1950).

In June 1949 the ROC declared a &quot;closure&quot; of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure covered from a point north of the mouth of Min River in Fujian Province to the mouth of the Liao River in Manchuria. Since mainland China&#x27;s railroad network was underdeveloped, north–south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen.

After losing mainland China, a group of approximately 12,000 KMT soldiers escaped to Burma and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China. Their leader, General Li Mi, was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of Yunnan. Initially, the United States supported these remnants and the Central Intelligence Agency provided them with aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the United Nations in 1953, the U.S. began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954, nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li Mi declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times.

During the Korean War, some captured Communist Chinese soldiers, many of whom were originally KMT soldiers, were repatriated to Taiwan rather than mainland China. A KMT guerrilla force continued to operate cross-border raids into south-western China in the early 1950s. The ROC government launched a number of air bombing raids into key coastal cities of mainland China such as Shanghai.

Though viewed as a military liability by the United States, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in Fujian as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On 3 September 1954, the First Taiwan Strait Crisis began when the PLA started shelling Quemoy and threatened to take the Dachen Islands. On 20 January 1955, the PLA took nearby Yijiangshan Island, with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the United States Congress passed the Formosa Resolution authorizing the President to defend the ROC&#x27;s offshore islands. The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the Bandung Conference.

The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis began on 23 August 1958 with air and naval engagements between the PRC and the ROC military forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of Quemoy (by the PRC) and Amoy (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year. PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the United States rejected Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided amphibious assault ships to land supply, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7, the United States escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing. On October 25, the PRC announced an &quot;even-day ceasefire&quot; — the PLA would only shell Quemoy on odd-numbered days.

Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war.

After the 1950s, the &quot;war&quot; became more symbolic than real, represented by on-again, off-again artillery bombardment towards and from Kinmen. In later years, live shells were replaced with propaganda sheets. The bombardment finally ceased in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the United States.

During this period, movement of people and goods virtually ceased between PRC- and ROC-controlled territories. There were occasional defectors. One high-profile defector was Justin Yifu Lin, who swam across the Kinmen strait to mainland China and is now Chief Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank.

Most observers expected Chiang&#x27;s government to eventually fall in response to a PRC invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang&#x27;s government in its final stand. Things changed radically with the onset of the Korean War in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President Harry S. Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent the ROC and PRC from attacking each other.

After the ROC complained to the United Nations against the Soviet Union supporting the PRC, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505 was adopted on 1 February 1952 to condemn the Soviet Union.

In 1987, the March 7 Incident (Lieyu massacre) in Lesser Kinmen cast a profound ripple on the cross-strait relation between China and Taiwan—4 months later on July 15, the martial law in Taiwan was lifted; and 5 months later on December 15, the ROC government began to allow visits to mainland China. This benefited many, especially old KMT soldiers, who had been separated from their family in mainland China for decades. This also proved a catalyst for the thawing of relations between the two sides. Problems engendered by increased contact necessitated a mechanism for regular negotiations.

In order to effect negotiations with mainland China on operational issues without compromising the government&#x27;s position on denying the other side&#x27;s legitimacy, the ROC government under Chiang Ching-kuo created the &quot;Straits Exchange Foundation&quot; (SEF), a nominally non-governmental institution directly led by the Mainland Affairs Council, an instrument of the Executive Yuan. The PRC responded to this initiative by setting up the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), directly led by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. This system, described as &quot;white gloves&quot;, allowed the two governments to engage with each other on a semi-official basis without compromising their respective sovereignty policies.

Led by highly respected elder statesmen Koo Chen-fu and Wang Daohan, the two organizations began a series of talks that culminated in the 1992 meetings, which, together with subsequent correspondence, established the 1992 Consensus, under which both sides agreed to deliberate ambiguity on questions of sovereignty, in order to engage on operational questions affecting both sides.

Also during this time, however, the rhetoric of ROC President Lee Tung-hui began to turn further towards Taiwan independence. Prior to the 1990s, the ROC had been a one-party authoritarian state committed to eventual reunification with mainland China. However, with democratic reforms the attitudes of the general public began to influence policy in Taiwan. As a result, the ROC government shifted away from its commitment to the One-China policy and towards a separate political identity for Taiwan. Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, was also unwilling to compromise. Jiang notoriously attempted to influence the 1996 ROC election in Taiwan by conducting a missile exercise designed to intimidate Taiwanese voters and interfere with international shipping, leading to the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. By 1998, semi-official talks had broken down.

Chen Shui-bian was elected President of the ROC in 2000. Politically, Chen is pro-Taiwan independence. Chen&#x27;s repudiation of the 1992 Consensus combined with the PRC&#x27;s insistence that the ROC agree to a &quot;One China&quot; principle for negotiations to occur prevented improvement in cross-strait relations.

Up until the 1970s, the international community generally considered the Kuomintang on Taiwan to be the legal representative of China, but acknowledgment of the nation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China slowly increased. In 1954, the Republic of China and the United States signed the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of China. In 1971, the United Nations acknowledged the People&#x27;s Republic of China to be the sole legal representative of China (United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758). The KMT government strengthened their &quot;Han and the thief cannot both stand&quot; (漢賊不兩立) stance and announced withdrawal from the United Nations. After this, the international position of the Republic of China slid to a large extent. In 1979, when the United States broke relations, it created an even more severe attack on the diplomatic plight of the ROC. In recent years, the ROC government has tried several times to apply anew to enter international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization, but, under the opposing side&#x27;s powerful obstruction, there has been no success.

The question of the political status of Taiwan or whether the two sides are moving toward unification or seeking &quot;de jure&quot; independence is still unresolved. The assertion of the People&#x27;s Republic of China both domestically and internationally is &quot;Whether from the perspective of history, government or international law, Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. The political status of Taiwan is a Chinese domestic affair, and, under the premise of no hope for unification as well as certain other (conditions), (the Chinese government) does not abandon (the possibility of) the use of force to resolve it.&quot; Those persons promoting Taiwan independence feel that, because of the Treaty of San Francisco signed by Japan and the United States and the unclear indication of the handover of Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty (the status of Taiwan was not decided on), Taiwan&#x27;s future direction should be decided upon by the people of Taiwan and that the People&#x27;s Republic of China not be permitted to threaten the use of force.

On 14 March 2005, the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China passed the Anti-Secession Law, making clear for the first time in legal form the One-China principle. Some people in Taiwan felt dissatisfied about this, and, on March 26, hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets of Taipei, participating in the 326 Protect Taiwan Demonstration, indicating their strong dissatisfaction with and protest of the law. Beginning on 26 April 2005, KMT, and various Pan-Blue political parties visited mainland China, creating an upsurge in the political dialogue between the two sides (see 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China), but cross-straits relations are still full of uncertainty.

Mainland China and Taiwan resumed regular weekend cross-strait charter direct flights on 4 July 2008, for the first time in six decades, as a &quot;new start&quot; in their tense relations. Liu Shaoyong, the China Southern Airlines chair, piloted the first flight from Guangzhou to the Taipei Songshan Airport. Simultaneously, a Taiwan-based China Airlines flew to Shanghai. A total of five mainland Chinese cities will be connected with eight Taiwan airports, with four days a week, 36 round-trip flights across the Taiwan Strait, thereby eliminating time-consuming Hong Kong stopovers.

On 7 November 2015, a meeting was held by ROC president Ma Ying-jeou and CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping in Singapore.

Recognition of the ROC has dwindled over the years. Recognition was withdrawn by The Gambia in 2013, São Tomé and Príncipe on 21 December 2016, Fiji in May 2017 (with unofficial relations from 1996 onwards), Panama on 13 June 2017, the Dominican Republic on 1 May 2018, Burkina Faso on 24 May 2018, El Salvador on 20 August 2018, Kiribati and the Solomon Islands in September 2019, Nicaragua in December 2021, Honduras in March 2023, and Nauru in January 2024. Only 11 UN member states (Guatemala, Belize, Eswatini, Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Paraguay, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Palau) and the Holy See maintain relations with the ROC.

== Economic growth ==
During the post-war period, Taiwan was lacking in goods and materials, the economy was depressed, and inflation was severe. After the national government moved to Taiwan, agriculture was first to grow, and, in 1953, Taiwan&#x27;s economy returned to its pre-war level. After this, the government pursued a policy of &quot;Nurture industry with agriculture&quot;(以農養工) on the foundation established during Japanese rule. With the capital, manpower, and skilled labor that was in Taiwan, American aid, etc., Taiwan&#x27;s economy progressively moved toward rapid growth. In the 1950s, the government carried out an import substitution policy, taking what was obtained by agriculture to give support to the industrial sector, trading agricultural product exports for foreign currency to import industrial machinery, thus developing the industrial sector. The government raised tariffs, controlled foreign exchange and restricted imports in order to protect domestic industry. By the 1960s, Taiwan&#x27;s import exchange industry was faced with the problem of saturating the domestic market. At the same time, the factories of some industrialized nations, because of rising wages and other reasons, slowly moved to certain areas that had both basic industry and low labor costs. Consequently, the economic policy of Taiwan changed to pursue export expansion. In 1960, the government enacted the &quot;Regulations for Encouraging Investment&quot;, actively competing for foreign business investment in Taiwan. In 1966, the government established the Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone, Asia&#x27;s first export processing zone, to expand the manufacturing production. In the role of a manufacturing relay station, Taiwan became a link in the international system of division of labor. In 1963, the proportion of Taiwan&#x27;s economy occupied by industry exceeded that of agriculture. From 1968, Taiwan maintained two-digit long-term annual average economic growth up until the 1973 oil crisis. In 1971, Taiwan had a foreign trade surplus and continued from then on in an export state and a major producer of electronics goods.

After retreating to Taiwan, Chiang learned from his mistakes and failures in the mainland and blamed them for failing to pursue Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s ideals of Tridemism and welfarism. Chiang&#x27;s land reform more than doubled the land ownership of Taiwanese farmers. It removed the rent burdens on them, with former land owners using the government compensation to become the new capitalist class. He promoted a mixed economy of state and private ownership with economic planning. Chiang also promoted a 9-years compulsory education and the importance of science in Taiwanese education and values. These measures generated great success with consistent and strong growth and the stabilization of inflation.

==Sports==
Football was introduced to Taiwan in 1916 by Edward Band who was the principal of Tainan&#x27;s Chang Jung High School. The Chang Jung High School team is considered to be the first football team in Taiwan with all current teams being in some way descendant of it.

Following the Chinese Civil War the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognized both the PRC and the ROC Olympic Committees in 1954. In 1958, The PRC withdrew its membership from the IOC and nine other international sports organizations in protest against the two-Chinas policy. After the withdrawal of the PRC, the IOC had been using a number of names in international Olympic activities to differentiate the ROC from the PRC. &quot;Formosa&quot; was used at the 1960 Summer Olympics, and &quot;Taiwan&quot; was used in 1964 and 1968. In 1975, the PRC applied to rejoin the IOC as the sole sports organization representing the whole China. The Taiwanese team, competing under the name of Republic of China at the previous Olympics, was refused to represent itself as the &quot;Republic of China&quot; or use &quot;China&quot; in its name by host Canadian government at the 1976 Summer Olympics. In April 1979, the IOC recognized the Olympic Committee of the PRC and maintained recognition of the Olympic Committee located in Taipei. In 1981, the ROC government formally accepted the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;.

<text>The Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) is a project to create an integrated freight railway network across Europe and Asia. The project is of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).

The project was initiated in the 1950s, with the objective of providing a continuous rail link between Singapore and Istanbul, Turkey, with possible further connections to Europe and Africa. At the time shipping and air travel were not as well developed, and the project promised to significantly reduce shipping times and costs between Europe and Asia. Progress in developing the TAR was hindered by political and economic obstacles throughout the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. By the 1990s, the end of the Cold War and normalisation of relations between some countries improved the prospects for creating a rail network across the Asian continent.

The TAR was seen as a way to accommodate the huge increases in international trade between Eurasian nations and facilitate the increased movements of goods between countries. It was also seen as a way to improve the economies and accessibility of landlocked countries like Laos, Afghanistan, Mongolia, and the Central Asian republics.

Much of the railway network already exists as part of the Eurasian Land Bridge, although significant gaps remain. A big challenge is the differences in rail gauge across Eurasia. Four major rail gauges (which measures the distance between rails) are in use across the continent: most of Europe, as well as Turkey, Iran, China, and the Koreas use the gauge, known as Standard gauge; Russia and the former Soviet republics use a gauge; Finland uses a gauge, both known as Russian gauge; the railways in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka use the gauge, known as Indian gauge; and most of Southeast Asia has metre gauge. For the most part the TAR would not change national gauges; mechanized transfer facilities would be built to transload shipping containers from train to train at the breaks of gauge.

== Routes ==
By 2001, four corridors had been studied:

* The Northern Corridor will link Europe and Northeast Asia via Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, North Korea and South Korea, with breaks of gauge at the Polish-Belarusian border ( to ), the Kazakhstan-Chinese border and the Mongolian-Chinese border (both to ). The Trans-Siberian Railway covers much of this route and currently carries large amounts of freight from East Asia to Moscow and on to the rest of Europe. Due to political problems with North Korea, freight from South Korea must currently be shipped by sea to the port of Vladivostok to access the route.
* The Southern Corridor, also called ITI-DKD-Y (Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad-Delhi-Kolkata-Dhaka-Yangon), will go from Europe to Southeast Asia, connecting Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Thailand, with links to China&#x27;s Yunnan Province and, via the Southeast Asian corridor, to Malaysia and Singapore. Gaps exist between Imphal-Moreh in India and to Tamu- Kalay (also called Kale and Kalemyo) in Myanmar, between Chittagong-Cox&#x27;s Bazar in Bangladesh to Myanmar and between Myanmar and Thailand. The section in eastern Iran between Bam and Zahedan has been completed. Breaks of gauge occur, or will occur, at the Iran-Pakistan border ( to ), the India-Myanmar border ( to ), and to China ( to ).
* A Southeast Asian network; this primarily consists of the Kunming–Singapore Railway.

* The North-South Corridor will link Northern Europe to the Persian Gulf. The main route starts in Helsinki, Finland, and continues through Russia to the Caspian Sea, where it splits into three routes: a western route through Azerbaijan, Armenia, and western Iran; a central route across the Caspian Sea to Iran via rail ferry; and an eastern route through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to eastern Iran. The routes converge in the Iran&#x27;s capital of Tehran and continue to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.

== Agreement ==

The Trans-Asian Railway Network Agreement is an agreement signed on 10 November 2006, by seventeen Asian nations as part of a United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) effort to build a transcontinental railway network between Europe and Pacific ports in China. The plan has sometimes been called the &quot;Iron Silk Road&quot; in reference to the historical Silk Road trade routes. UNESCAP&#x27;s Transport &amp; Tourism Division began work on the initiative in 1992 when it launched the Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development project.

The agreement formally came into force on 11 June 2009.

=== Network ===
The Trans-Asian Railway system will consist of four main railway routes. The existing Trans-Siberian railway, which connects Moscow to Vladivostok, will be used for a portion of the network in Russia. Another corridor to be included will connect China to Korea, Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2003, the president of Kazakhstan proposed building a standard gauge link from Dostyk (on the Chinese border) to Gorgan in Iran; it has not yet been built.

==== Standards ====

Complicating the plan is the differences in rail gauges currently in use across the continent. While China, Iran, Laos and Turkey use tracks, tracks of Russia and Central Asia are gauged at . In South Asia, India&#x27;s and Pakistan&#x27;s tracks are gauged at . In South East Asia, the tracks of Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia are with some dual gauge tracks near the China–Vietnam border and within Bangladesh, and tracks in Indonesia and Japan are mostly gauge. This leads to time-consuming interchanges or transloading to handle the break of gauge at main connecting points in the network.

Other standards to consider include allowing for interoperability:
* Railway electrification – 25 kV AC the world standard for new long distance and heavy duty construction since the 1950s.
* Couplings – buffers and chains, Alliance, or SA3. Some dual couplings and adapters or barrier vehicles are possible.
* Brakes – air, with or without electronically controlled pneumatic brakes (ECP).
* Loading gauge and structure gauge – able to take tallest possible shipping container. Possible double stacking.
* Signalling systems – where signals are electronic, not physically visible, and must be &#x27;read&#x27; by equipment in the locomotives, or where the train must interact in different ways with the infrastructure
* Electromagnetic interference – where radio waves (noise) from electric motors can interact with different signalling systems
* Rules and regulations.
* Language, including Seaspeak.
* Break of gauge devices, such as dual gauge, Train on Train piggybacking or variable gauge axles.

=== Participating nations ===
Transportation and railway ministers from forty one nations participated in the week-long conference held in Busan, South Korea, where the agreement was formulated. The proposed 80,900-km railway network will originate from the Pacific seaboard of Asia and end on the doorsteps of Europe. The agreement&#x27;s cosigners included the following participating countries:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
The 28 countries that did not sign the agreement at the conference had until 31 December 2007, to join and ratify the agreement.

On 5 May 2007, officials in Bangladesh announced that the nation will sign on to the agreement at an upcoming meeting in New York City. The plan for the network includes three lines between India and Myanmar that traverse Bangladesh. India made a similar announcement on 17 May 2007. As part of the agreement, India will build and rehabilitate rail links with neighboring Myanmar in projects that are estimated to cost more than 29.41 billion (US$730 million). Bangladesh finally signed the agreement on 10 November 2007.

India&#x27;s Look-East connectivity policy has resulted in the launch of several connectivity projects with China and ASEAN nations.

== Progress ==
The Northern Corridor was in operation as early as the 1960s, although at first only for Soviet Union-China trade. The Southern corridor has progressively opened up after 2000. Successes so far include:

=== Northern Line ===
* Rail link from China to Kazakhstan (Turkestan–Siberia Railway and Lanxin railway, with break-of-gauge) has been completed since 1990, allowing cargo services such as Yiwu–London and Chongqing–Xinjiang–Europe lines
* Second link from China to Kazakhstan (line Zhetigen–Khorgos, completed in December 2011).
* Direct freight service between Germany and China through Russia and Mongolia or Kazakhstan, operating from the first decade of the 2000s (transloading of container at break-of-gauge).

=== Southern Line ===
* The Eurasia Marmaray Tunnel connecting European Turkey and Asian Turkey, opened in 2013. At that time the tunnel was isolated from rail network but finally got connected with the completion of Marmaray project in 2019. The first international freight train transporting magnesite and connecting Çukurhisar (in Tepebaşı, Eskişehir) to Austria ran through the tunnel last week of October 2019. Before this, there was a freight-train ferry there.
* A train ferry across Lake Van, from 1970s allowing rail services between Turkey and Iran.
* Link from Iran to Central Asia (Trans-Caspian railway; branch Tejen–Sarakhs–Mashhad, completed in 1996).
* Link from Iran to Herat in Afghanistan completed 2013.
* Iran-Pakistan: A Bam–Zahedan link, with a break-of-gauge at Zahedan (Pakistan railway uses broad gauge and Iran railway uses standard gauge ). In August 2009 a goods train carrying containers traveled from Islamabad, Pakistan to Istanbul, Turkey; by April 2011, trains were running regularly.
* In 2016, Bangladesh decided to connect to the network with a rail line from Dohazari to Gundum near Myanmar border.

=== Southeast Asia ===
* The Boten–Vientiane railway opened in December 2021, completing the Central section of the line and forming a near through-train connection from Kunming to Singapore (with a break-of-gauge in Vientiane).

=== North–South Transport Corridor ===
* Agreement in 2014 between Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia on completing the north–south corridor. The missing link is Astara–Rasht, 167 km. On 7 January 2017, it was announced that construction on this section would start in 2017.

<doc id="498809" wikidata="Q4516015" url="?curid=498809" title="Chimurenga">
<text>Chimurenga is a word in Shona. The Ndebele equivalent is not as widely used since most Zimbabweans speak Shona; it is Umvukela, meaning &quot;revolutionary struggle&quot; or uprising. In specific historical terms, it also refers to the Ndebele and the Shona insurrections against administration of the British South Africa Company during the late 1890s, the First Chimurenga—and the war fought between African nationalist guerrillas and the predominantly-white Rhodesian government during the 1960s and the 1970s, the Rhodesian Bush War, or the Second &quot;Chimurenga&quot;/&quot;Imvukela&quot;.

The concept is also occasionally used in reference to the land reform programme undertaken by the Zimbabwe government since 2000, which some call the Third &quot;Chimurenga&quot;. Proponents of land reform regard it as the final phase in what they hold to be the liberation of Zimbabwe by economic and agrarian reforms that are intended to empower indigenous people, despite the economic collapse that soon followed, which some have labelled the &quot;Third &quot;Chimurenga&quot;&quot; as being the catalyst.

In a modern context, the word may denote a struggle for human rights, political dignity and social justice. The expression is also used in context with modern Zimbabwean music, Chimurenga music.

==Etymology==
The name Chimurenga is coined from the great ancestor of the now Shona, Venda and Kalanga people. The Nambya people are also a part of this group. Their ancestor was known by the name Murenga Musorowenzou (Head of an Elephant), known by the Venda as &quot;Thoho yaNdou&quot; and &quot;Sholo reZhou&quot;. The later two have named their cities after this man while the Shona honoured him by naming their wars of struggle after him.

==First &quot;Chimurenga&quot; (1896-1897)==

The First &quot;Chimurenga&quot; is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First War of Independence. It is also known in the English speaking world as the Second Matabele War. This conflict refers to the 1896–1897 Ndebele-Shona revolt against the British South Africa Company&#x27;s administration of the territory.

Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual/religious leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. He convinced the Ndebele and Shona that the white settlers (almost 4,000 strong by then) were responsible for the drought, locust plagues and the cattle disease rinderpest ravaging the country at the time. Mlimo&#x27;s call to battle was well timed. Only a few months earlier, the British South Africa Company&#x27;s Administrator General for Matabeleland, Leander Starr Jameson, had sent most of his troops and armaments to fight the Transvaal Republic in the ill-fated Jameson Raid. This left the country&#x27;s defences in disarray. The Ndebele began their revolt in March 1896.

In June 1896, Mashayamombe led the uprising of the Zezuru Shona people located to the South West of the capital Salisbury. Mashayamombe worked with the local spiritual leader Kaguvi, and during this period a white farmer, Norton and his wife were killed at Porta Farm in Norton.

The third phase of the First &quot;Chimurenga&quot; was joined by the Hwata Dynasty of Mazoe. They succeeded in driving away the white settlers from the Mashonaland on 20 June 1896. Three months later, the British South Africa Police regrouped and established control over the Hwata people after their Mambo (King) Hwata surrendered together with his spirit medium, Nehanda Nyakasikana.
Hwata and Nehanda Nyakasikana were sentenced to death and executed.

Mlimo was eventually assassinated in his temple in Matobo Hills by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham. Upon learning of the death of Mlimo, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the native&#x27;s stronghold and persuaded the Impi to lay down their arms. The first &quot;Chimurenga&quot; thus ended in October 1897. Matabeleland and Mashonaland were unified under company rule and named Southern Rhodesia.

==Second &quot;Chimurenga&quot; (1967–79)==

The Second &quot;Chimurenga&quot;, also known as the Rhodesian Bush War or the Zimbabwe Liberation War, refers to the guerrilla war of the 1966–1979 which led to the end of white-minority rule in Rhodesia and to the &quot;de jure&quot; independence of Zimbabwe. The physical manifestation of the war was as a conflict between the predominantly white minority government, headed by Ian Smith, and the black nationalist movements of ZANU and ZAPU, respectively led by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo.

==In music==

&quot;Chimurenga&quot; also refers to a style of music first branded by Thomas Mapfumo, who mixed indigenous African rhythmic patterns and instruments such as mbira (thumb piano), drums, gourd rattles with Western styles (electric guitar) in songs that achieved wide popularity among the protest movement against white minority rule. Today the term &quot;Chimurenga&quot; music refers to popular Shona music from Zimbabwe.

<doc id="498811" wikidata="Q2179671" url="?curid=498811" title="Roman roads in Britannia">
<text>Roman roads in Britannia were initially designed for military use, created by the Roman army during the nearly four centuries (AD 43–410) that Britannia was a province of the Roman Empire. 

It is estimated that about of paved trunk roads (surfaced roads running between two towns or cities) were constructed and maintained throughout the province. Most of the known network was complete by 180. The primary function of the network was to allow rapid movement of troops and military supplies, but it subsequently provided vital infrastructure for commerce, trade and the transportation of goods.

A considerable number of Roman roads remained in daily use as core trunk roads for centuries after the end of Roman rule in Britain in 410. Some routes are now part of the UK&#x27;s national road network. Others have been lost or are of archeological and historical interest only.

After the Romans departed, systematic construction of paved highways in the United Kingdom did not resume until the early 18th century. The Roman road network remained the only nationally managed highway system within Britain until the establishment of the Ministry of Transport in the early 20th century. 

==Overview==
Prior to the Roman conquest of Britain, pre-Roman Britons mostly used unpaved trackways for travel. These routes, many of which had prehistoric origins, followed elevated ridge lines across hills, such as the South Downs Way. Although most routes were unpaved tracks, some British tribes had begun engineering roads during the first century BC.

Beginning in AD 43, the Romans quickly created a national road network. Engineers from the Roman army, in most cases, surveyed and built them from scratch. Key locations, both strategic and administrative, were connected by the most direct routes possible. Main roads were gravel or paved, had bridges constructed in stone or wood, and manned waypoints where travellers or military units could stop and rest. 

The roads&#x27; impermeable design permitted travel in all seasons and weather. Following the withdrawal of the Roman legions in 410, the road system soon fell into disrepair. Large sections were abandoned and lost. Parts of the network were retained by the Anglo-Saxons, eventually becoming integral routes in Anglo-Saxon Britain.

==Historical development==


The earliest roads, built in the first phase of Roman occupation (the Julio-Claudian period, AD 43–68), connected London with the ports used in the invasion (Chichester and Richborough), and with the earlier legionary bases at Colchester, Lincoln (&quot;Lindum&quot;), Wroxeter (&quot;Viroconium&quot;), Gloucester and Exeter. The Fosse Way, from Exeter to Lincoln, was also built at this time to connect these bases with each other, marking the effective boundary of the early Roman province.

During the Flavian period (AD 69–96), the roads to Lincoln, Wroxeter and Gloucester were extended (by CE 80) to the legionary bases at &quot;Eboracum&quot; (York), &quot;Deva Victrix&quot; (Chester) and &quot;Isca Augusta&quot; (Caerleon). By 96, further extensions were completed from York to Corbridge, and from Chester to &quot;Luguvalium&quot; (Carlisle) and &quot;Segontium&quot; (Caernarfon) as Roman rule was extended over &quot;Cambria&quot; (Wales) and northern England (&quot;Brigantia&quot;). Stanegate, the military road from Carlisle to Corbridge, was built under the Emperor Trajan (ruled 98–117) along the line of the future Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which was constructed by his successor Hadrian in 122–132.

Scotland (&quot;Caledonia&quot;), including England north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, remained mostly outside the boundaries of &quot;Britannia&quot; province, as the Romans never succeeded in subjugating the entire island, despite a serious effort to do so by governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 82–84. The Romans maintained a system of forts in the lowland region –220 to control the indigenous population beyond Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and annexed the Lowlands briefly with the construction of the Antonine Wall in 164. This barrier, across the &#x27;neck&#x27; of Scotland, from the Firth of Clyde to the Firth of Forth, was held for twenty years.

The Romans&#x27; main routes from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to the Antonine Wall, built by , were:
* Corbridge to the Roman fort at Cramond, Edinburgh (certain) and (likely) to Carriden (&quot;Veluniate&quot;) on the eastern end of the Antonine Wall, via High Rochester (&quot;Bremenium&quot;) and Melrose (&quot;Trimontium&quot;); 
* Carlisle to Bothwellhaugh (certain) and (likely) to the Antonine.

There was also a certain road beyond the Antonine Wall to Perth (&quot;Bertha&quot;) from the Antonine fort at Falkirk. Indeed, it has been thought that the Roman road to the north of the Forth, to Stirling and Perth, dates from the expedition of Severus to beyond the Dee in 209; it may be doubted whether there was time in that campaign for such a work, and the road may well belong to a period before the construction of the Antonine Wall in 140.

The core network was complemented by a number of routes built primarily for commercial, rather than military, purposes.

Examples include: in Kent and Sussex, three certain roads leading from London to the important iron-mining area of the Weald; and in East Anglia, the road from Colchester to Norwich, Peddars Way and the Fen Causeway. These eastern and southern routes acquired military importance from the 3rd century onwards with the emergence of Saxon seaborne raiding as a major and persistent threat to the security of &quot;Britannia&quot;. These roads linked to the coastal defensive line of Saxon Shore forts such as Brancaster (&quot;Branodunum&quot;), Burgh Castle (&quot;Gariannonum&quot;) near Great Yarmouth, Lympne (&quot;Portus Lemanis&quot;) and Pevensey (&quot;Anderitum&quot;).

==Construction and maintenance==
Standard Roman road construction techniques, long evolved on the Continent, were used. A road occupied a wide strip of land bounded by shallow ditches, varying in width from 86 &quot;pedes&quot; () on Ermin Way in Berkshire to 338 &quot;pedes&quot; () on Akeman Street in Oxfordshire. A trunk road in Britain would typically be in width, with a gauge of being the most common. Watling Street was wide while the Fosse Way was little more than half that. Several unnamed roads were wider than Watling Street, such as the Silchester to Chichester road at .

In the centre a carriageway was built on a raised &quot;agger&quot; after stripping off soft topsoil, using the best local materials, often sand or sandy gravel. The two strips of ground between the &quot;agger&quot; and the boundary ditches were used by pedestrians and animals, and were sometimes lightly metalled. The &quot;agger&quot; was sometimes, but not always, bordered by deep ditches to take rainwater and keep the road structure as dry as possible.

The metalling was in two layers, a foundation of medium to large stones covered by a running surface, often a compacted mixture of smaller flint and gravel. About one quarter of road pavements were &quot;bottomed&quot; with large stones, mostly in the north and west where stone was more readily available. Some high-status roads in Italy were bound together by volcanic mortar, and a small minority of excavated sites in Britain have shown concrete or limestone mortar. Road surfaces in the iron-producing areas of the Weald were made from iron slag. The average depth of metalling over 213 recorded roads is about , with great variation from as little as to up to in places, probably built up over centuries.

The main trunk roads were originally constructed by the Roman army. Responsibility for their regular repair and maintenance rested with designated imperial officials (the &quot;curatores viarum&quot;), though the cost would probably have been borne by the local &quot;civitas&quot; (county) authorities whose territory the road crossed. From time to time, the roads would be completely resurfaced and might even be entirely rebuilt, e.g. the complete reconstruction and widening of the &quot;Via Aemilia&quot; in northern Italy by the Emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BC – AD 14), two centuries after it was first built.

After the final withdrawal of Roman government and troops from Britain in 410, regular maintenance ended on the road network. Repairs became intermittent and based on &quot;ad hoc&quot; work. Despite the lack of any national management of the highways, Roman roads remained fundamental transport routes in England throughout the Early, High and Late Middle Ages. Systematic construction of paved highways did not resume until the building of the first turnpikes in the early 18th century.

==Archaeological evidence==
Extant remains of Roman roads are often much degraded or contaminated by later surfacing. Well-preserved sections of structures sometimes identified as Roman roads include Wade&#x27;s Causeway in Yorkshire, and at Blackpool Bridge in the Forest of Dean, although their integrity as original Roman surfaces is not certain. In many places, Roman roads were built over in the 18th century to create the turnpikes. Where they have not been built over, many sections have been ploughed over by farmers and some stripped of their stone to use on turnpike roads. 

There are numerous tracts of Roman road which have survived, albeit overgrown by vegetation, in the visible form of footpaths through woodland or common land, such as the section of Stane Street crossing Eartham Wood in the South Downs near Bignor (Sussex). This and others like it are marked on Ordnance Survey maps with dotted lines. Peddars Way in Norfolk is a Roman road converted into a long-distance footpath.

Wayside stations have been identified in Britain. Roman roads had regularly spaced stations along their length – the Roman equivalent of motorway service areas. Roughly every – the most a horse could safely be ridden hard – there would be a &quot;mutatio&quot; (literally: &quot;a change&quot;), essentially stables where mounted messengers could change horses and a tavern to obtain refreshment. Cavalrymen from auxiliary mixed infantry- and cavalry- regiments (&quot;cohortes equitatae&quot;) provided most of the army&#x27;s despatch-riders (&quot;dispositi&quot;). Relays of fresh riders and horses careering at full gallop could sustain an average speed of about . Thus an urgent despatch from the army base at York to London – , a journey of over a week for a normal mounted traveller – could be delivered in just 10 hours. Because &quot;mutationes&quot; were relatively small establishments, and their remains ambiguous, it is difficult to identify sites with certainty.

Approximately every – a typical day&#x27;s journey for an ox-drawn wagon – was a &quot;mansio&quot; (literally: &quot;a sojourn&quot;, from which derive the English word &quot;mansion&quot; and French &quot;maison&quot; or &quot;house&quot;). This was a full-scale wayside inn, with large stables, tavern, rooms for travellers and even bath-houses in the larger establishments. &quot;Mansiones&quot; also housed detachments of troops, primarily auxiliaries, who regularly garrisoned and patrolled the roads along their whole length. These would check the identities, travel permits and cargoes of road users.

&quot;Mansiones&quot; may have housed the agents of the imperial procurator, the chief financial officer in the province, who collected the &quot;portorium&quot;, an imperial toll on goods in transit on public roads that was charged at 2 to per cent of the value. The tax would be exacted when the goods crossed fixed toll points along the roads, which likely were located in or near &quot;mansiones&quot;. At least half a dozen sites have been positively identified as &quot;mansiones&quot; in Britain, e.g. the excavated &quot;mansio&quot; at Godmanchester (&quot;Durovigutum&quot;) on Ermine Street (near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire).

&quot;Mutationes&quot; and &quot;mansiones&quot; were the key infrastructure for the &quot;cursus publicus&quot; (the imperial postal and transport system), which operated in many provinces of the Roman Empire. The &quot;cursus&quot; was primarily concerned with the carriage of government or military officers, government payload such as monies from tax collection and for military wages, and official despatches, but it could be made available to private individuals with special permission and for a fee. In Britain, the Vindolanda tablets, a series of letters written on wooden tablets to and by members of the garrison of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, show the operation of the &quot;cursus&quot; on the island.

Milestones, of which 95 are recorded in &quot;Roman Inscriptions of Britain&quot;. Most of these date from the later part of the Roman period (AD250 onwards), since it was the practice to replace a road&#x27;s milestones when a major repair was carried out. Milestones were usually cylindrical and in height. Most contain only the customary dedication to the current Emperor and the number of miles to a particular destination. Only three provide additional information: two are dedicated by the public works departments of a &quot;civitas&quot; (county) (&quot;Dobunni&quot;) and a city (Lincoln), showing the involvement of local authorities in road maintenance; and the third records that the Emperor Caracalla (reigned 211–217) &quot;restored the roads, which had fallen into ruin and disuse through old age&quot;.

Maps and Itineraries of the Roman era, designed to aid travellers, provide useful evidence of placenames, routes and distances in Britain. The most important is the Antonine Itinerary, dating from the later 3rd century, which contains 14 itineraries on the island.

== Road naming in post-Roman Britain ==

The original names of the Roman roads in Britain are not known due to the lack of written and inscribed sources. This is in contrast to surviving routes in Italy and other Roman provinces within western Europe. In Britain, most major such routes bear Welsh, early Anglo-Saxon or later Middle English names, ascribed after the end of Roman rule in Britain (during the period known as the Early Middle Ages). This means that the toponym of a road is not based on the original Roman nomenclature for naming highways within Britannia Superior or Britannia Inferior. 

For example, the Anglo-Saxons used the name Watlingestrate for the entire route from Dover/Portus Ritupis to Wroxeter, via Londinium (London); it is one of four former Roman roads named as public rights of way under the Laws of Edward the Confessor in the early 11th century.

Official road names were usually taken from the Emperor in whose reign they were completed, such as the Via Traiana from Rome to Brindisi in southern Italy which was named after the Emperor Trajan (98–117). As the Dover to London section of Watling Street was begun in the years following the Roman invasion of Britain in 43, it may have been known to the Romano-Britons as the &quot;Via Claudia&quot; in honour of Emperor Claudius (41–54) who led the military campaign.

The only well-documented name which might be etymologically linked to an original Roman name is the Fosse Way between Exeter and Lincoln, which may derive from &quot;fossa&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;ditch&quot;. But this is likely to be attributable to a popular, rather than official, Roman name for the route. Generally, those Roman roads in Britain which are named look to Anglo-Saxon giants and divinities. For instance, Wade&#x27;s Causeway in North Yorkshire is taken from Wade of Germanic and Norse mythology.

English place names continue to reflect the settlement of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons. As these Germanic Pagan peoples advanced westward across the British isles, they encountered the decaying infrastructure of the former Roman Empire. Many settlements were founded on or near Roman roads (suffix &quot;-street&quot; e.g. Watling Street). The prefix &quot;strat-, strait-, streat-&quot; was employed to name settlements near these former imperial highways. &quot;Stretham&quot; means &quot;homestead or village on a Roman road&quot; and likewise &quot;Stretford&quot; means &quot;ford on a Roman road&quot;.

==Main routes==

The initial road network was built by the army to facilitate military communications. The emphasis was therefore on linking up army bases, rather than catering for economic flows. Thus, three important cross-routes were established connecting the major legionary bases by AD 80 as the frontier of the Roman-occupied zone advanced:
* Exeter (&quot;Isca&quot;) – Lincoln (&quot;Lindum&quot;)
* Gloucester (&quot;Glevum&quot;) – York (&quot;Eboracum&quot;)
* Caerleon (&quot;Isca&quot;) – York via Wroxeter (&quot;Viroconium&quot;) and Chester (&quot;Deva&quot;)
Later a large number of other cross-routes and branches were grafted onto this basic network.

After Boudica&#x27;s Revolt, London (&quot;Londinium&quot;) commanded the major bridge across the Thames connecting the final northern and western legionary bases with the Kentish ports communicating with Boulogne (&quot;Gesoriacum&quot;) and the rest of the Empire. Six core roads were constructed tying the new capital to the existing network. Ignoring their later English names, they are as follows:

* London – Canterbury (&quot;Durovernum&quot;). At Canterbury, this route split into 4 major branches to the major Roman ports:
** Canterbury – Richborough Castle (&quot;Rutupiae&quot;)
** Canterbury – Dover (&quot;Portus Dubris&quot;)
** Canterbury – Lympne (&quot;Portus Lemanis&quot;)
** Canterbury – Reculver (&quot;Regulbium&quot;)
* London – Chichester (&quot;Noviomagus&quot;), a port
* London – Silchester (&quot;Calleva Atrebatum&quot;). At Silchester, this route split into 3 major branches:
** Silchester – Portchester (&quot;Portus Adurni&quot;), a port, via Winchester (&quot;Venta&quot;) and Southampton (&quot;Clausentum&quot;)
** Silchester – Old Sarum (&quot;Sorviodunum&quot;), offering connections to Exeter and Dorchester (&quot;Durnovaria&quot;)
** Silchester – Caerleon, base of the 2nd legion, via Gloucester
* London – Chester, base of the 20th legion, via St Albans (&quot;Verulamium&quot;), Lichfield (&quot;Letocetum&quot;), and Wroxeter and with continuation to Carlisle (&quot;Luguvalium&quot;) on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall
* London – York, base of the 9th and 6th legions, via Lincoln and with continuation to Corbridge (&quot;Coria&quot;) on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall
* London – Colchester (&quot;Camulodunum&quot;), with continuation to Caistor St Edmund (&quot;Venta&quot;)

=== List of Roman Roads and modern numberings ===

*A.Sections of modern road that lie directly above the Roman road. Such stretches are marked &quot;ROMAN ROAD&quot; on Ordnance Survey Maps.
*B.Not to be confused with Icknield Way, a pre-Roman trackway from Buckinghamshire to Norfolk. Although the known road ends at Templeborough, it almost certainly continued to Doncaster (&quot;Danum&quot;) to join a branch of Ermine Street to York.
*C.This is not a Saxon name, but a Latin one invented by 18th century antiquarians to define a putative route. It amounts to just a series of cross routes to reach Watling Street from Colchester.
*D. This a sinuous, linear monument that might be up to 6,000 years old in the North York Moors national park. Its stone course is only 1 mile (1.6 km) long on Wheeldale Moor but the inclusion of other stretches create a 25-mile (40 km) section. Its provenance as a Roman Road is an ongoing academic study.

<text>Cancer support groups are meetings that offer a safe space for people affected by cancer to share their experiences and emotions with other people who have cancer. People in stressful situations benefit from having a good social support system, and a cancer support group can be part of a support system.

Cancer support groups are similar to other kinds of other types of support groups. Different support systems have thus been developed including community support groups, online cancer support groups, networks, forums, and charitable organizations. Some groups focus on specific types of cancer and others include anyone. There are also support groups for family members and survivors.

== Types ==
Community support groups are usually led by psychologists, social workers, and medical professionals and can take place in churches, hospitals, or community centers.

Online support groups and forums are convenient for people who find it difficult to leave their homes. People participating in such forums have the possibility to maintain their anonymity.

Also, people may have different concerns stemming from their particular situation in life which may warrant a special support group that caters specifically to their needs. For example, there are support groups dedicated to helping younger women through their cancer experience, or that focus on parents with younger children.

Support for rare cancers is particularly challenging, as patients may be a long way from specialist treatment centers, and also from other patients with whom they might gain support and advice. The advent of the internet has allowed support groups for these rare cancers to emerge on a global basis, providing one to one and group oriented advice and support to patients and their families who may live on different continents, yet are able to share symptoms, experiences and advice, for example on diet or pain relief. Organizations such as European Organisation for Rare Diseases assist in coordinating and providing support for such organizations.

== Emotional and informational support ==
Cancer support groups can provide both emotional and informational support. However, many online cancer support groups skew towards providing more informational support. For example, cancer support groups may also share information regarding available treatments, managing side effects, or negotiating accommodations from a workplace.

Apart from having to cope with the physical and medical challenges, people with cancer face many worries, feelings, and concerns unique to their situation. Cancer patients may find that they need help coping with the emotional as well as the practical aspects of their disease. Attention to the emotional burden of having cancer is often a part of a patient&#x27;s treatment plan. The support of the health care team (doctors, nurses, social workers), support groups, and patient-to-patient networks can help people feel less isolated and distressed, and improve the quality of their lives.

==No effect on cancer survival==
Support groups provide many immediate and practical benefits to participants. However, participation in a support group does not cure cancer, slow the spread of cancer, or result in longer survival.

<doc id="498814" wikidata="Q868452" url="?curid=498814" title="Come Away with Me">
<text>Come Away with Me is the debut studio album by American recording artist Norah Jones, released on February 26, 2002, by Blue Note Records. Recording sessions took place at Sorcerer Sound Studio in New York City and Allaire Studios in Shokan, New York.

&quot;Come Away with Me&quot; peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and received Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. It was later certified Diamond by the RIAA on February 15, 2005, for shipments of over ten million copies in the United States, and has sold over 27 million copies worldwide as of 2016, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.

==Composition==

&quot;Come Away with Me&quot; is an acoustic pop and blues pop album that features Jones supported by jazz musicians: Kevin Breit, Bill Frisell, Adam Levy, Adam Rogers, and Tony Scherr on guitar; Sam Yahel on organ; Jenny Scheinman on violin; Rob Burger on accordion; and Brian Blade, Dan Rieser, and Kenny Wollesen on drums. Jones wrote the title song. Guitarist Jesse Harris wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot;. The album includes Jones&#x27; versions of &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; by Hoagy Carmichael and &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; by Hank Williams.

&quot;Come Away with Me&quot; incorporates blues, jazz, folk, soul, and country. Bobby Dodd of &quot;All About Jazz&quot; writes that although the album features jazz standards, jazz purists and academics &quot;may deny [Jones] jazz credibility for her folk infusion&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Come Away with Me&quot; debuted at number 139 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US upon its release in February 2002 selling 10,000 copies in its first week. Despite being released at a time when music piracy was high and album sales were declining, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in August that same year. The album eventually climbed to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in January 2003, almost a year after it was released selling 108,000 copies that week. By the time of the Grammy Awards the following month, &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; had already sold 3 million copies in the country. Jones&#x27; success at the award show resulted in the album moving another 600,000 copies the week immediately following the awards. In total, the album appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 165 weeks and sold 11.1 million copies in the US as of March 2016. The album was certified Diamond by the RIAA in February 2005 for selling over ten million copies in the US. It was also the eleventh best-selling album of the Nielsen SoundScan era as of 2016.

As of October 2016, the album had sold more than 27 million copies worldwide. Polyphonic HMI&#x27;s &quot;Hit Song Science&quot; software claimed to have predicted the album&#x27;s success months before its release, contradicting skeptical executives. In Germany, the album debuted at No. 37. It remained on the German Albums Chart for 141 weeks and reached No. 2 in its 37th week on that chart, where it stayed for four weeks. &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; sold 750,000 copies, reaching 5× gold, becoming her most successful album in Germany and one of the longest charting albums on the German Albums Chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Come Away with Me&quot; received acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 82 out of 100, which indicates &quot;universal acclaim&quot; based on 9 reviews.

The album received 3.5 out of 4 stars from both the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviews. AllMusic&#x27;s David R. Adler wrote that &quot;while the mood of this record stagnates after a few songs, it does give a strong indication of Jones&#x27; alluring talents.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; cited it as &quot;the most unjazz album [Blue Note] has ever released&quot; and criticized that &quot;Jones&#x27;s voice dominates the record.&quot;

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave it a favorable review and called the album &quot;A showcase for Jones&#x27; remarkable voice, the disc captures a singer whose rare instinct for interpretation always serves the song, rather than working against it.&quot; &quot;E! Online&quot; gave it an A and stated: &quot;Gorgeous and intimate, the 14 songs on her debut disc ache with romantic maturity and a smart, slow-jam sexiness that belies the fact that, at 22, Jones is hardly older than Britney Spears.&quot;

&quot;Kludge&quot; included it on their list of best albums of 2002. Mark Beaumont, writing for &quot;NME&quot; in 2016, included it on his list of eight of the all-time best-selling albums in the UK have no redeeming features whatsoever, dubbing it &quot;soporific, simplistic jazz wallpaper muzak&quot;.

== 20th anniversary edition ==
In April 2022, a remastered expanded edition of &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; was released, with demos from the promo-only &quot;First Sessions&quot; EP, and including 22 previously unreleased demos, outtakes, and alternative versions.

<doc id="498815" wikidata="Q628155" url="?curid=498815" title="Workhouse">
<text>In Britain and Ireland, a workhouse (, lit. &quot;poor-house&quot;) was a total institution where those unable to support themselves financially were offered accommodation and employment. In Scotland, they were usually known as poorhouses. The earliest known use of the term &quot;workhouse&quot; is from 1631, in an account by the mayor of Abingdon reporting that &quot;we have erected within our borough a workhouse to set poorer people to work&quot;.

The origins of the workhouse can be traced to the Statute of Cambridge 1388, which attempted to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers, and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor. However, mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular, and a series of bad harvests, meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable. The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse. Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates. Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones, crushing bones to produce fertiliser, or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike.

As the 19th century wore on, workhouses increasingly became refuges for the elderly, infirm, and sick rather than the able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions under the control of local authorities. It was not until the introduction of the National Assistance Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 29) that the last vestiges of the Poor Law finally disappeared, and with them the workhouses.

==Legal and social background==
===Medieval to Early Modern period===
The Statute of Cambridge 1388 was an attempt to address the labour shortage caused by the Black Death, a devastating pandemic that killed about one-third of England&#x27;s population. The new law fixed wages and restricted the movement of labourers, as it was anticipated that if they were allowed to leave their parishes for higher-paid work elsewhere then wages would inevitably rise. According to historian Derek Fraser, the fear of social disorder following the plague ultimately resulted in the state, and not a &quot;personal Christian charity&quot;, becoming responsible for the support of the poor. The resulting laws against vagrancy were the origins of state-funded relief for the poor. From the 16th century onwards a distinction was legally enshrined between those who were willing to work but could not, and those who were able to work but would not: between &quot;the genuinely unemployed and the idler&quot;. Supporting the destitute was a problem exacerbated by King Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries, which began in 1536. They had been a significant source of charitable relief, and provided a good deal of direct and indirect employment. The Poor Act 1575 went on to establish the principle that if the able-bodied poor needed support, they had to work for it.

The Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601 made parishes legally responsible for the care of those within their boundaries who, through age or infirmity, were unable to work. The Act essentially classified the poor into one of three groups. It proposed that the able-bodied be offered work in a house of correction (the precursor of the workhouse), where the &quot;persistent idler&quot; was to be punished. It also proposed the construction of housing for the impotent poor, the old and the infirm, although most assistance was granted through a form of poor relief known as outdoor relief – money, food, or other necessities given to those living in their own homes, funded by a local tax on the property of the wealthiest in the parish.

===Georgian era===
The workhouse system evolved in the 17th century, allowing parishes to reduce the cost to ratepayers of providing poor relief. The first authoritative figure for numbers of workhouses comes in the next century from &quot;The Abstract of Returns made by the Overseers of the Poor&quot;, which was drawn up following a government survey in 1776. It put the number of parish workhouses in England and Wales at more than 1800 (about one parish in seven), with a total capacity of more than 90,000 places. This growth in the number of workhouses was prompted by the Workhouse Test Act 1723; by obliging anyone seeking poor relief to enter a workhouse and undertake a set amount of work, usually for no pay (a system called indoor relief), the Act helped prevent irresponsible claims on a parish&#x27;s poor rate.

The growth was also bolstered by the Relief of the Poor Act 1782, proposed by Thomas Gilbert. Gilbert&#x27;s Act was intended to allow parishes to share the cost of poor relief by joining together to form unions, known as Gilbert Unions, to build and maintain even larger workhouses to accommodate the elderly and infirm. The able-bodied poor were instead either given outdoor relief or found employment locally. Relatively few Gilbert Unions were set up, but the supplementing of inadequate wages under the Speenhamland system did become established towards the end of the 18th century. So keen were some Poor Law authorities to cut costs wherever possible that cases were reported of husbands being forced to sell their wives, to avoid them becoming a financial burden on the parish. In one such case in 1814 the wife and child of Henry Cook, who were living in Effingham workhouse, were sold at Croydon market for one shilling (5p); the parish paid for the cost of the journey and a &quot;wedding dinner&quot;.

By the 1830s most parishes had at least one workhouse, but many were badly managed. In his 1797 work, &quot;The State of the Poor&quot;, Sir Frederick Eden, wrote:

Instead of a workhouse, some sparsely populated parishes placed homeless paupers into rented accommodation, and provided others with relief in their own homes. Those entering a workhouse might join anywhere from a handful to several hundred other inmates; for instance, between 1782 and 1794 Liverpool&#x27;s workhouse accommodated 900–1200 indigent men, women and children. The larger workhouses such as the Gressenhall House of Industry generally served a number of communities, in Gressenhall&#x27;s case 50 parishes. Writing in 1854, Poor Law commissioner George Nicholls viewed many of them as little more than factories:

===1834 Act===

By 1832 the amount spent on poor relief nationally had risen to £7 million a year, more than 10 shillings (£) per head of population, up from £2 million in 1784. The large number of those seeking assistance was pushing the system to &quot;the verge of collapse&quot;. The economic downturn following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century resulted in increasing numbers of unemployed. Coupled with developments in agriculture that meant less labour was needed on the land, along with three successive bad harvests beginning in 1828 and the Swing Riots of 1830, reform was inevitable.

Many suspected that the system of poor relief was being widely abused. In 1832 the government established a Royal Commission to investigate and recommend how relief could best be given to the poor. The result was the establishment of a centralised Poor Law Commission in England and Wales under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, also known as the New Poor Law, which discouraged the allocation of outdoor relief to the able-bodied; &quot;all cases were to be &#x27;offered the house&#x27;, and nothing else&quot;. Individual parishes were grouped into Poor Law Unions, each of which was to have a union workhouse. More than 500 of these were built during the next 50 years, two-thirds of them by 1840. In certain parts of the country there was a good deal of resistance to these new buildings, some of it violent, particularly in the industrial north. Many workers lost their jobs during the major economic depression of 1837, and there was a strong feeling that what the unemployed needed was not the workhouse but short-term relief to tide them over. By 1838, 573 Poor Law Unions had been formed in England and Wales, incorporating 13,427 parishes, but it was not until 1868 that unions were established across the entire country: the same year that the New Poor Law was applied to the Gilbert Unions.

Despite the intentions behind the 1834 Act, relief of the poor remained the responsibility of local taxpayers, and there was thus a powerful economic incentive to use loopholes such as sickness in the family to continue with outdoor relief; the weekly cost per person was about half that of providing workhouse accommodation. Outdoor relief was further restricted by the terms of the 1844 Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order, which aimed to end it altogether for the able-bodied poor. In 1846, of 1.33 million paupers only 199,000 were maintained in workhouses, of whom 82,000 were considered to be able-bodied, leaving an estimated 375,000 of the able-bodied on outdoor relief. Excluding periods of extreme economic distress, it has been estimated that about 6.5% of the British population may have been accommodated in workhouses at any given time.

==Early Victorian workhouses==
The New Poor Law Commissioners were very critical of existing workhouses, and generally insisted that they be replaced. They complained in particular that &quot;in by far the greater number of cases, it is a large almshouse, in which the young are trained in idleness, ignorance, and vice; the able-bodied maintained in sluggish sensual indolence; the aged and more respectable exposed to all the misery that is incident to dwelling in such a society&quot;.

After 1835 many workhouses were constructed with the central buildings surrounded by work and exercise yards enclosed behind brick walls, so-called &quot;pauper bastilles&quot;. The commission proposed that all new workhouses should allow for the segregation of paupers into at least four distinct groups, each to be housed separately: the aged and impotent, children, able-bodied males, and able-bodied females. A common layout resembled Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s prison panopticon, a radial design with four three-storey buildings at its centre set within a rectangular courtyard, the perimeter of which was defined by a three-storey entrance block and single-storey outbuildings, all enclosed by a wall. That basic layout, one of two designed by the architect Sampson Kempthorne (his other design was octagonal with a segmented interior, sometimes known as the Kempthorne star), allowed for four separate work and exercise yards, one for each class of inmate. Separating the inmates was intended to serve three purposes: to direct treatment to those who most needed it; to deter others from pauperism; and as a physical barrier against illness, physical and mental.
The commissioners argued that buildings based on Kempthorne&#x27;s plans would be symbolic of the recent changes to the provision of poor relief; one assistant commissioner expressed the view that they would be something &quot;the pauper would feel it was utterly impossible to contend against&quot;, and &quot;give confidence to the Poor Law Guardians&quot;. Another assistant commissioner claimed the new design was intended as a &quot;terror to the able-bodied population&quot;, but the architect George Gilbert Scott was critical of what he called &quot;a set of ready-made designs of the meanest possible character&quot;. Some critics of the new Poor Law noted the similarities between Kempthorne&#x27;s plans and model prisons, and doubted that they were merely coincidental - Richard Oastler went as far as referring to the institutions as &#x27;prisons for the poor&#x27;. Augustus Pugin compared Kempthorne&#x27;s octagonal plan with the &quot;antient poor hoyse&quot;, in what Felix Driver calls a &quot;romantic, conservative critique&quot; of the &quot;degeneration of English moral and aesthetic values&quot;.

By the 1840s some of the enthusiasm for Kempthorne&#x27;s designs had waned. With limited space in built-up areas, and concerns over the ventilation of buildings, some unions moved away from panopticon designs. Between 1840 and 1870 about 150 workhouses with separate blocks designed for specific functions were built. Typically the entrance building contained offices, while the main workhouse building housed the various wards and workrooms, all linked by long corridors designed to improve ventilation and lighting. Where possible, each building was separated by an exercise yard, for the use of a specific category of pauper.

=== Admission and discharge ===

Each Poor Law Union employed one or more relieving officers, whose job it was to visit those applying for assistance and assess what relief, if any, they should be given. Any applicants considered to be in need of immediate assistance could be issued with a note admitting them directly to the workhouse. Alternatively they might be offered any necessary money or goods to tide them over until the next meeting of the guardians, who would decide on the appropriate level of support and whether or not the applicants should be assigned to the workhouse.

Workhouses were designed with only a single entrance guarded by a porter, through which inmates and visitors alike had to pass. Near to the entrance were the casual wards for tramps and vagrants and the relieving rooms, where paupers were housed until they had been examined by a medical officer. After being assessed the paupers were separated and allocated to the appropriate ward for their category: boys under 14, able-bodied men between 14 and 60, men over 60, girls under 14, able-bodied women between 14 and 60, and women over 60. Children under the age of two were allowed to remain with their mothers, but by entering a workhouse paupers were considered to have forfeited responsibility for their families. Clothing and personal possessions (with the possible exception of spectacles) were usually taken from them and stored, to be returned on their discharge. After bathing, they were issued with a distinctive uniform: for men it might be a striped cotton shirt, jacket and trousers, and a cloth cap, and for women a blue-and-white striped dress worn underneath a smock. Shoes were also provided. In some establishments certain categories of inmate were marked out by their clothing; for example, at Bristol Incorporation workhouse, prostitutes were required to wear a yellow dress and pregnant single women a red dress; such practices were deprecated by the Poor Law Commission in a directive issued in 1839 entitled &quot;Ignominious Dress for Unchaste Women in Workhouses&quot;, but they continued until at least 1866. Some workhouses had a separate &quot;foul&quot; or &quot;itch&quot; ward, where inmates diagnosed with skin diseases such as scabies could be detained before entering the workhouse proper. Also not to be overlooked were unfortunate destitute sufferers of mental health disorders, who would be ordered to enter the workhouse by the parish doctor. The Lunacy Act 1853 did promote the asylum as the institution of choice for patients afflicted with all forms of mental illness. However, in reality, destitute people suffering from mental illness would be housed in their local workhouse.
Conditions in the casual wards were worse than in the relieving rooms, and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential troublemakers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves at the door of a workhouse were at the mercy of the porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.

A typical early 19th-century casual ward was a single large room furnished with some kind of bedding and perhaps a bucket in the middle of the floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in London in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night&#x27;s accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day; for instance at Guisborough men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.

Inmates were free to leave whenever they wished after giving reasonable notice, generally considered to be three hours, but if a parent discharged him- or herself then the children were also discharged, to prevent them from being abandoned. The comic actor Charlie Chaplin, who spent some time with his mother in Lambeth workhouse, records in his autobiography that when he and his half-brother returned to the workhouse after having been sent to a school in Hanwell, he was met at the gate by his mother Hannah, dressed in her own clothes. Desperate to see them again she had discharged herself and the children; they spent the day together playing in Kennington Park and visiting a coffee shop, after which she readmitted them all to the workhouse.

Available data surrounding death rates within the workhouse system is minimal; however, in the Wall to Wall documentary &quot;Secrets from the Workhouse&quot;, it is estimated that 10% of those admitted to the workhouse after the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act died within the system.

===Work===

Some Poor Law authorities hoped that payment for the work undertaken by the inmates would produce a profit for their workhouses, or at least allow them to be self-supporting, but whatever small income could be produced never matched the running costs. In the 18th century, inmates were poorly managed, and lacked either the inclination or the skills to compete effectively with free market industries such as spinning and weaving. Some workhouses operated not as places of employment, but as houses of correction, a role similar to that trialled by Buckinghamshire magistrate Matthew Marryott. Between 1714 and 1722 he experimented with using the workhouse as a test of poverty rather than a source of profit, leading to the establishment of a large number of workhouses for that purpose. Nevertheless, local people became concerned about the competition to their businesses from cheap workhouse labour. As late as 1888, for instance, the Firewood Cutters Protection Association was complaining that the livelihood of its members was being threatened by the cheap firewood on offer from the workhouses in the East End of London.

Many inmates were allocated tasks in the workhouse such as caring for the sick or teaching that were beyond their capabilities, but most were employed on &quot;generally pointless&quot; work, such as breaking stones or removing the hemp from telegraph wires. Workhouses were sometimes colloquially known as &#x27;The Spike&#x27;, which may derive from the common task of picking oakum using a large metal nail, also known as a spike. Bone-crushing, useful in the creation of fertiliser, was a task most inmates could perform, until a government inquiry into conditions in the Andover workhouse in 1845 found that starving paupers were reduced to fighting over the rotting bones they were supposed to be grinding, to suck out the marrow. The resulting scandal led to the withdrawal of bone-crushing as an employment in workhouses and the replacement of the Poor Law Commission by the Poor Law Board in 1847. Conditions were thereafter regulated by a list of rules contained in the 1847 Consolidated General Order, which included guidance on issues such as diet, staff duties, dress, education, discipline, and redress of grievances.

Some Poor Law Unions opted to send destitute children to the British colonies, in particular to Canada and Australia, where it was hoped the fruits of their labour would contribute to the defence of the empire and enable the colonies to buy more British exports. Known as Home Children, the Philanthropic Farm school alone sent more than 1000 boys to the colonies between 1850 and 1871, many of them taken from workhouses. In 1869 Maria Rye and Annie Macpherson, &quot;two spinster ladies of strong resolve&quot;, began taking groups of orphans and children from workhouses to Canada, most of whom were taken in by farming families in Ontario. The Canadian government paid a small fee to the ladies for each child delivered, but most of the cost was met by charities or the Poor Law Unions.

As far as possible, elderly inmates were expected to undertake the same kind of work as the younger men and women, although concessions were made to their relative frailty. Or they might be required to chop firewood, clean the wards, or carry out other domestic tasks. In 1882 Lady Brabazon, later the Countess of Meath, set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non-able-bodied inmates, known as the Brabazon scheme. Volunteers provided training in crafts such as knitting, embroidery and lace making, all costs initially being borne by Lady Brabazon herself. Although slow to take off, when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise self-financing, the scheme gradually spread across the country, and by 1897 there were more than 100 branches.

===Diet===

In 1836 the Poor Law Commission distributed six diets for workhouse inmates, one of which was to be chosen by each Poor Law Union depending on its local circumstances. Although dreary, the food was generally nutritionally adequate, and according to contemporary records was prepared with great care. Issues such as training staff to serve and weigh portions were well understood. The diets included general guidance, as well as schedules for each class of inmate. They were laid out on a weekly rotation, the various meals selected on a daily basis, from a list of foodstuffs. For instance, a breakfast of bread and gruel was followed by dinner, which might consist of cooked meats, pickled pork or bacon with vegetables, potatoes, yeast dumpling, soup and suet, or rice pudding. Supper was normally bread, cheese and broth, and sometimes butter or potatoes.

The larger workhouses had separate dining rooms for males and females; workhouses without separate dining rooms would stagger the meal times to avoid any contact between the sexes.

===Education===

Education was provided for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children with little or no interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job for more than a few months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.

Some children were trained in skills valuable to the area. In Shrewsbury, the boys were placed in the workhouse&#x27;s workshop, while girls were tasked with spinning, making gloves and other jobs &quot;suited to their sex, their ages and abilities&quot;. At St Martin in the Fields, children were trained in spinning flax, picking hair and carding wool, before being placed as apprentices. Workhouses also had links with local industry; in Nottingham, children employed in a cotton mill earned about £60 a year for the workhouse. Some parishes advertised for apprenticeships, and were willing to pay any employer prepared to offer them. Such agreements were preferable to supporting children in the workhouse: apprenticed children were not subject to inspection by justices, thereby lowering the chance of punishment for neglect; and apprenticeships were viewed as a better long-term method of teaching skills to children who might otherwise be uninterested in work. Supporting an apprenticed child was also considerably cheaper than the workhouse or outdoor relief. Children often had no say in the matter, which could be arranged without the permission or knowledge of their parents. The supply of labour from workhouse to factory, which remained popular until the 1830s, was sometimes viewed as a form of transportation. While getting parish apprentices from Clerkenwell, Samuel Oldknow&#x27;s agent reported how some parents came &quot;crying to beg they may have their Children out again&quot;. Historian Arthur Redford suggests that the poor may have once shunned factories as &quot;an insidious sort of workhouse&quot;.

===Religion===

Religion played an important part in workhouse life: prayers were read to the paupers before breakfast and after supper each day. Each Poor Law Union was required to appoint a chaplain to look after the spiritual needs of the workhouse inmates, and he was invariably expected to be from the established Church of England. Religious services were generally held in the dining hall, as few early workhouses had a separate chapel but in some parts of the country, notably Cornwall and northern England, there were more dissenters than members of the established church. As section 19 of the 1834 Poor Law specifically forbade any regulation forcing an inmate to attend church services &quot;in a Mode contrary to [their] Religious Principles&quot;, the commissioners were reluctantly forced to allow non-Anglicans to leave the workhouse on Sundays to attend services elsewhere, so long as they were able to provide a certificate of attendance signed by the officiating minister on their return.

As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers increasingly began to conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation had been introduced during the 17th century to limit the civil rights of Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 in the wake of the failed Gunpowder Plot that year. Though almost all restrictions on Catholics in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the appointment of a Catholic chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.

===Discipline===
Discipline was strictly enforced in the workhouse; for minor offences such as swearing or feigning sickness the &quot;disorderly&quot; could have their diet restricted for up to 48 hours. For more serious offences such as insubordination or violent behavior the &quot;refractory&quot; could be confined for up to 24 hours, and might also have their diet restricted. Girls were punished in the same way as adults but sometimes in older cases girls were also beaten or slapped, but boys under the age of 14 could be beaten with &quot;a rod or other instrument, such as may have been approved of by the Guardians&quot;. Children, specifically orphans, who leave the grounds without being discharged or run away from workhouses could be severely disciplined and could be confined with no food or water. The persistently refractory, or anyone bringing &quot;spirituous or fermented liquor&quot; into the workhouse, could be taken before a Justice of the Peace and even gaoled. All punishments handed out were recorded in a punishment book, which was examined regularly by the workhouse guardians, locally elected representatives of the participating parishes with overall responsibility for the running of the workhouse.

===Management and staffing===

Although the commissioners were responsible for the regulatory framework within which the Poor Law Unions operated, each union was run by a locally elected board of guardians, comprising representatives from each of the participating parishes, assisted by six &quot;ex officio&quot; members. The guardians were usually farmers or tradesmen, and as one of their roles was the contracting out of the supply of goods to the workhouse, the position could prove lucrative for them and their friends. Simon Fowler has commented that &quot;it is clear that this [the awarding of contracts] involved much petty corruption, and it was indeed endemic throughout the Poor Law system&quot;.

Although the 1834 Act allowed for women to become workhouse guardians provided they met the property requirement, the first female was not elected until 1875. Working class guardians were not appointed until 1892, when the property requirement was dropped in favour of occupying rented premises worth £5 a year.

Every workhouse had a complement of full-time staff, often referred to as the indoor staff. At their head was the governor or master, who was appointed by the board of guardians. His duties were laid out in a series of orders issued by the Poor Law Commissioners. As well as the overall administration of the workhouse, masters were required to discipline the paupers as necessary and to visit each ward twice daily, at 11 am and 9 pm. Female inmates and children under seven were the responsibility of the matron, as was the general housekeeping. The master and the matron were usually a married couple, charged with running the workhouse &quot;at the minimum cost and maximum efficiency – for the lowest possible wages&quot;.

A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, accommodating several thousand paupers, employed a staff of almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse in addition to the master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.

==Later developments and abolition==

A second major wave of workhouse construction began in the mid-1860s, the result of a damning report by the Poor Law inspectors on the conditions found in infirmaries in London and the provinces. Of one workhouse in Southwark, London, an inspector observed bluntly that &quot;The workhouse does not meet the requirements of medical science, nor am I able to suggest any arrangements which would in the least enable it to do so&quot;. By the middle of the 19th century there was a growing realisation that the purpose of the workhouse was no longer solely or even chiefly to act as a deterrent to the able-bodied poor, and the first generation of buildings was widely considered to be inadequate. About 150 new workhouses were built mainly in London, Lancashire and Yorkshire between 1840 and 1875, in architectural styles that began to adopt Italianate or Elizabethan features, to better fit into their surroundings and present a less intimidating face. One surviving example is the gateway at Ripon, designed somewhat in the style of a medieval almshouse. A major feature of this new generation of buildings is the long corridors with separate wards leading off for men, women and children.

By 1870 the architectural fashion had moved away from the corridor design in favour of a pavilion style based on the military hospitals built during and after the Crimean War, providing light and well-ventilated accommodation. Opened in 1878, the Manchester Union&#x27;s infirmary comprised seven parallel three-storey pavilions separated by &quot;airing yards&quot;; each pavilion had space for 31 beds, a day room, a nurse&#x27;s kitchen and toilets. By the start of the 20th century new workhouses were often fitted out to an &quot;impressive standard&quot;. Opened in 1903, the workhouse at Hunslet in West Riding of Yorkshire had two steam boilers with automatic stokers supplying heating and hot water throughout the building, a generator to provide electricity for the institution&#x27;s 1,130 electric lamps, and electric lifts in the infirmary pavilion.

As early as 1841 the Poor Law Commissioners were aware of an &quot;insoluble dilemma&quot; posed by the ideology behind the New Poor Law:
The education of children presented a similar dilemma. It was provided free in the workhouse but had to be paid for by the &quot;merely poor&quot;; free primary education for all children was not provided in the UK until 1918. Instead of being &quot;less eligible&quot;, conditions for those living in the workhouse were in certain respects &quot;more eligible&quot; than for those living in poverty outside.
By the late 1840s most workhouses outside London and the larger provincial towns housed only &quot;the incapable, elderly and sick&quot;. By the end of the century only about 20 per cent of those admitted to workhouses were unemployed or destitute, but about 30 per cent of the population over 70 were in workhouses. The introduction of pensions for those aged over 70 in 1908 did not reduce the number of elderly housed in workhouses, but it did reduce the number of those on outdoor relief by 25 per cent.

Responsibility for administration of the Poor Law passed to the Local Government Board in 1871, and the emphasis soon shifted from the workhouse as &quot;a receptacle for the helpless poor&quot; to its role in the care of the sick and helpless. The Diseases Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1883 allowed London workhouse infirmaries to offer treatment to non-paupers as well as inmates, and by the beginning of the 20th century some infirmaries were even able to operate as private hospitals.

The Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905–1909 reported that workhouses were unsuited to deal with the different categories of resident they had traditionally housed, and recommended that specialised institutions for each class of pauper should be established, in which they could be treated appropriately by properly trained staff. The &quot;deterrent&quot; workhouses were in future to be reserved for &quot;incorrigibles such as drunkards, idlers and tramps&quot;. On 24 January 1918 the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the Local Government Committee on the Poor Law had presented to the Ministry of Reconstruction a report recommending abolition of the workhouses and transferring their duties to other organizations.

The Local Government Act 1929 gave local authorities the power to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals, although outside London few did so.
The workhouse system was abolished in the UK by the same Act on 1 April 1930, but many workhouses, renamed Public Assistance Institutions, continued under the control of local county councils. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 almost 100,000 people were accommodated in the former workhouses, 5,629 of whom were children.

The National Assistance Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 29) abolished the last vestiges of the Poor Law, and with it the workhouses. Many of the workhouse buildings were converted into retirement homes run by the local authorities; slightly more than half of local authority accommodation for the elderly was provided in former workhouses in 1960. Camberwell workhouse (in Peckham, South London) continued until 1985 as a homeless shelter for more than 1,000 men, operated by the Department of Health and Social Security and renamed a resettlement centre. Southwell Workhouse, now a museum, was used to provide temporary accommodation for mothers and children until the early 1990s.

==Modern view==

The Poor Law was not designed to address the issue of poverty, which was considered to be the inevitable lot for most people; rather it was concerned with pauperism, &quot;the inability of an individual to support himself&quot;. Writing in 1806 Patrick Colquhoun commented that:
Historian Simon Fowler has argued that workhouses were &quot;largely designed for a pool of able-bodied idlers and shirkers ... However this group hardly existed outside the imagination of a generation of political economists&quot;. Workhouse life was intended to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply, a principle known as less eligibility. 
Friedrich Engels, however, described what he imagined the motives of the authors of the 1834 New Poor Law to be, &quot;to force the poor into the Procrustean bed of their preconceived notions. To do this they treated the poor with incredible savagery.&quot;

The purpose of workhouse labour was never clear according to historian M. A. Crowther. In the early days of workhouses it was either a punishment or a source of income for the parish, but during the 19th century the idea of work as punishment became increasingly unfashionable. The idea took hold that work should rehabilitate the workhouse inmates for their eventual independence, and that it should therefore be rewarded with no more than the workers&#x27; maintenance, otherwise there would be no incentive for them to seek work elsewhere.

As of 1997, around 10% of the British population had a genealogical connection to the workhouse system.

==In art and literature==

The &quot;dramatic possibilities&quot; of the workhouse provided the inspiration for several artists including Charles West Cope, whose &quot;Board Day Application for Bread&quot; (1841), depicting a young widow pleading for bread for her four children, was painted following his visit to a meeting of the Staines Board of Guardians. The &quot;quintessential workhouse yarn&quot; is &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838) by Charles Dickens, which contains the well-known request from Oliver to the master of the workhouse: &quot;Please, sir, I want some more&quot;. Another popular piece of workhouse literature was the dramatic monologue &quot;In the Workhouse – Christmas Day&quot; (1877) by George Robert Sims, with its first line of &quot;It is Christmas Day in the workhouse&quot;. In chapter XXVII of his first book, &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; (1933), George Orwell gives a brief but vivid account of his stay in a London workhouse when he roamed the streets as a tramp. In 1931 an early version of this account had been published as an essay &quot;The Spike&quot; in an issue of &quot;The New Adelphi&quot;.

<text>Bowie State University (Bowie State or BSU) is a public historically black university in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, north of Bowie. It is part of the University System of Maryland. Founded in 1865, Bowie State is Maryland&#x27;s oldest historically black university and one of the ten oldest in the country. Bowie State is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

== History ==
===Teachers College===
Bowie State University is the oldest historically black university in Maryland. It was founded in 1865 by the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of the Colored People as a teaching school. The school first used space at the African Baptist Church at Calvert Street and Saratoga Street, in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1867, a dedicated facility was purchased nearby at Saratoga Street and Courtland Street, and the school was formally named the Baltimore Normal School for Colored Teachers. After being reorganized in 1883 as the Baltimore Normal School, it educated African Americans to be teachers for African American students until 1908. At that time, the school became a state institution of teaching under the Maryland State Department of Education and was redesignated as a Normal School No. 3.

Shortly thereafter, in 1910, the school moved to the Jericho Farm, a 187-acre campus in Prince George&#x27;s County. About 60 students lived in the old farmhouse. The school was renamed in 1914 as the Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie. A two-year professional degree was added in 1925, a three-year program in 1931, a four-year program for elementary school teachers in 1935, a four-year program for junior high school teachers in 1951, and a four-year program for secondary school teachers in 1961. In recognition of its principal role, the school was renamed in 1935 as Maryland Teachers College at Bowie.

===Bowie State University===
In 1963, Bowie State College was officially named a liberal arts school – with additional majors in English, history, and social science – although emphasis remained on teacher education. A Master&#x27;s degree in education was added in 1969.

The school was renamed Bowie State University in 1988, as a member of the University System of Maryland. In the subsequent decades, Bowie continued to expand, especially in professional and Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In 1992, it became the first HBCU to expand overseas, with graduate programs for military personnel stationed abroad. By 2017, the school offered 20+ undergraduate majors and 30+ advanced degrees or certificate programs.

Bowie State University was ranked #61 in the United States and was #1 in the State of Maryland for alumni earnings above expectation according to &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine&#x27;s first-ever rating of colleges in America, which was released in October 2015. They used a statistical estimate for each college based exclusively on factors such as average SAT scores, sex ratio, race breakdown, college size, whether a university was public or private, and the mix of subjects students chose to study.

In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $25 million to Bowie State. Her donation is the largest single gift in Bowie State&#x27;s history.

== Academics ==
BSU has 29 undergraduate majors, 20 master&#x27;s programs, 3 doctoral programs, and 20 certificate programs in disciplines as diverse as computer science, education, human resource development, organizational communication, and nursing. In partnership with the University of Maryland University College, it became the first historically black university to include overseas studies. It was also the first university in the nation to offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree in pedology.

The university is home to The Maryland Center, a not-for-profit organization founded in 1998 providing community services. In partnership with the federal General Services Administration, the campus hosts the Bowie State University Telecommuting Center.

Bowie State University offers an honors program for academically talented and ambitious undergraduate students.

== Campus and facilities ==



The campus comprises 23 buildings with more than 988,897 square feet (92,000 m2) of space. It is located in Bowie, Maryland, between the metropolitan areas of Baltimore (25 miles) and Washington, D.C. (17 miles). An on-campus MARC Train station and Metrobus stops provide access to local transit. There are Wi-Fi and public computer labs across campus for student use.

Twenty-three percent of students live on campus in seven residence halls. Campus events include cultural performances, lectures, and sporting events. The oldest building still in use is Harriet Tubman Hall, built in 1921. The Student Union Building, which replaced the old Wiseman Center, was inaugurated in 2013. Other recent improvements to the campus have been the $71 million Fine &amp; Performing Arts Center, with 123,000 square feet for art, music, dance, visual communication and digital media arts, and theater programs, replacing the former Martin Luther King, Jr., Arts Center.

The $17.6 million Center for Business and Graduate Studies houses the College of Business, Graduate School, Graduate Admissions Office, the BSU Entrepreneurship Academy, and the Bowie Business Innovation Center, the first business accelerator to open at a Maryland HBCU. Other facilities include the Christa McAuliffe Residential Community (CMRC) apartments, the Computer Science Building, a facility serving the computer science and computer technology programs, and the $6.5 million Center for Learning Technology (CLT), serving the College of Professional Studies.

On campus, the Bowie State Satellite Operations Control Center (BSOCC) is an orbiting satellite operation and control center allowing students to gain hands-on experience. In 2003, the center went fully operational. It is a joint venture operated by the university, the Honeywell Corporation, and NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

In September 2007, the university began negotiations with Prince George&#x27;s County for the transfer of of land to the school. According to county documents, the land, valued at $1.3 million, would cost the university nothing if used &quot;for educational uses including facilities that benefit the welfare of students and faculty in their educational experience at the University&quot;. Adding this land would increase the university&#x27;s size by 63%. The main focus for the land is the development of additional student dorms. The land will also be used to establish several retail businesses that will cater to students and the community.

== Athletics ==

Bowie State&#x27;s athletes compete in the Northern Division of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, in the NCAA&#x27;s Division II. They compete and/or train on-campus in Bulldog Stadium, the Leonidas S. James Physical Education Complex, and the A. C. Jordan Arena. The Bulldogs play the following sports:
* Basketball
* Bowling
* Cross Country
* Football
* Indoor Track &amp; Field
* Outdoor Track &amp; Field
* Softball
* Tennis
* Volleyball

In addition, BSU sponsors athletic clubs for students at the intramural and recreational levels. The Fitness Room in the Leonidas James Physical Education Complex also has open hours for students, faculty, and staff.

Bowie State has many academic clubs, fraternities, honor societies, organizations, sororities, and student associations. The computer, education, French, and history clubs are examples of academic clubs. The art guild, concert and marching bands, jazz and brass ensembles, and others allow students to explore the fine and performing arts.

BSU-TV Channel 74 is a cable television station that broadcasts around the clock for the BSU community, and WBSU Bulldog Nation Radio streams programming online. Both stations are operated under the aegis of the Department of Communications. They have converted from analog to digital technology. WBSU Bulldog Nation Radio was launched in 2018 with support from Maryland-based Radio One.

The university is a supporter of the Prince George&#x27;s Film Festival.

=== Music ===
The Symphony of Soul, also known as SOS, is the name of the marching/concert/pep band at Bowie State University. The Symphony of Soul has received rave reviews following collegiate performances, and when representing the university abroad. During the fall, students always expect the usual impromptu parade through the campus by the SOS. They were also a part of the NFL 2007–2008 season opener as they performed the National Anthem with Aretha Franklin and shared the stage with other recording artists such as Aerosmith, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, and others. The SOS was featured in the Original Battle of the Bands held at RFK Stadium. The SOS drumline was named as one of Showtime Magazine&#x27;s top ten amongst HBCUs.

<doc id="498821" wikidata="Q3801336" url="?curid=498821" title="Iodobenzamide">
<text>Iodobenzamide (IBZM or iolopride) is a pharmaceutical drug used for diagnostic purposes. It is a dopamine antagonist and it can be used by nuclear medicine physicians as a radioactive tracer for SPECT where the radioactive isotope is iodine-123 or iodine-125. The main purpose of a brain study with IBZM is the differentiation of Parkinson&#x27;s disease from other neurodegenerative diseases such as Lewy Body dementia and multiple system atrophy.

== Study ==
Iodobenzamide can also be used to treat people that have schizophrenia. The Iodobenzamide binds to the Dopamine D2 receptors in the person’s brain and blocks excess neurons that cause an asymmetry in the brain, leaning heavily to the left side. People that receive doses of Iodobenzamide have their brain scanned to monitor their dopamine activity. A study found that patients that were drug-naive (did not have tolerance to the drug) had significant reactions in the left hemisphere of their brain to the drug. Patients with a first dose of Iodobenzamide were scanned and given benperidol (a drug used to treat hypersexuality) then scanned again. Male patients showed a left side heavy brain asymmetry of dopamine receptor binding in a drug-naive state. Benperidol leads to a reversal of the asymmetry. Drug-naive patient’s brains have a harder time binding the antipsychotic drugs to the part of their brain that receives the Dopamine D2 receptor.

<doc id="498826" wikidata="Q7976270" url="?curid=498826" title="Wayne Goss">
<text>Wayne Keith Goss (26 February 1951 – 10 November 2014) was Premier of Queensland from 7 December 1989 until 19 February 1996, becoming the first Labor Premier of the state in over 32 years. Prior to entering politics, Goss was a solicitor, and after leaving politics he served as Chairman of the Queensland Art Gallery and Chairman of Deloitte Australia.

==Early life==
He was born at Mundubbera, Queensland, and grew up at Inala where he was educated at Inala State High School and the University of Queensland where he earned a bachelor of laws degree. He worked as a solicitor and then with the Aboriginal Legal Service before setting up his own practice, but did not become a member of the Australian Labor Party until the dismissal of Gough Whitlam&#x27;s government in November 1975.

==Political career==
Goss entered state politics as a Labor Party MLA in 1983 for the electoral district of Salisbury and, from 1986 onwards, for Logan.

Along with others, Goss was a key figure in the 1970s–1980s civil liberties fight against the Bjelke-Petersen Government, pursuing legal and political strategies against Bjelke-Petersen. He was elected Leader of the Opposition in March 1988.

===Leader of the Labor Party===
Goss led Labor into the 1989 state election against the National Party government of Russell Cooper. The Queensland Nationals were still reeling from revelations of the rampant corruption of longtime premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and polls showed Labor had its best chance of winning power in years. Labor had been in opposition since 1957, and last made a serious bid for government in 1972. Cooper had toppled Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s immediate successor, Mike Ahern, in a September party-room coup, two months before the writ was dropped.

Goss seized on National ads that argued his plans to decriminalise homosexuality would result in gays flooding into Queensland. He replied with ads painting Cooper as a wild-eyed reactionary and a carbon copy of Bjelke-Petersen.

====Premiership====

Goss and Labor won a strong majority government at the 1989 election, scoring a 24-seat swing, the worst defeat of a sitting government up until that time in Queensland. This was fuelled by a massive Labor wave that swept through Brisbane; Labor won all but five of the capital&#x27;s 36 seats.

His election win, which ended 32 years of Coalition/National Party rule, was seen as &quot;the end of the Bjelke-Petersen era&quot; and the beginning of a new era, with &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; declaring &quot;Goss the Boss&quot;. Once installed in office, he presided over the implementation of many of the reforms of the landmark Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption.

The Goss Government introduced several electoral and public sector reforms, the most notable being the elimination of the &quot;Bjelkemander&quot; malapportionment that had helped keep the Queensland Nationals in power. In addition to reforming the state&#x27;s electoral laws and boundaries, the Goss Government &quot;introduced merit-based appointments to the Queensland public service, created new National Parks and oversaw a new regime of economic and budgetary management&quot; It also introduced social reforms such as decriminalising homosexuality, appointing Queensland&#x27;s first female Governor, abolishing the Queensland Police Special Branch and Imperial honours, and made provision &quot;to buy thousands of extra university places and hire thousands of new teachers&quot;. Goss&#x27; Chief of Staff as Premier was former diplomat Kevin Rudd, later leader of the federal Labor Party and Prime Minister of Australia, and Goss&#x27; 1989 campaign director was Wayne Swan, subsequently Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. Glyn Davis also worked in senior roles during the Goss governments.

Goss won a second term at the 1992 state election, maintaining the same 19-seat majority he won in 1989 over the National Party and the Liberal Party (the two non-Labor parties went out of coalition in 1983, but resumed the coalition after the 1992 election).

Before the 1995 election, the Goss Government announced a plan to clear sensitive bushland for an alternative to one of south-east Queensland&#x27;s major roadways. This prompted the Greens Party to do something it had never done before: it recommended that its supporters &quot;not&quot; give their second preference, on voting ballots, to Labor. Partly as a result of this, as well as the increasing unpopularity of Goss&#x27;s management style (widely thought to be authoritarian) and growing anger at the federal Labor government, Labor was severely punished at the polls. Notably, it lost several seats in Brisbane&#x27;s Bayside area, known as &#x27;the koala seats&#x27; because of the passion stirred up by a belief that the new road would destroy the habitat of koalas. While Labor lost the popular vote to the Rob Borbidge-led Coalition, Labor managed to win 31 out of 40 seats in Brisbane while most of the Coalition&#x27;s majority was wasted on large majorities in National heartland. This seemingly allowed Labor to salvage a knife-edge majority of one seat.

After the 1995 election, Labor&#x27;s majority hung on the Townsville seat of Mundingburra, which had been won by Labor&#x27;s Ken Davies by only 12 votes over the Coalition&#x27;s Frank Tanti. However, several irregularities were discovered, the most serious being that several servicemen serving in Rwanda did not have their votes counted. The Supreme Court of Queensland, sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns, ordered a by-election for February 1996, which Tanti won. This outcome brought about a hung Parliament, with both the Coalition and Labor on 44 seats. The balance of power was held by Gladstone&#x27;s newly elected Independent member, Liz Cunningham. Nine days after the by-election, Cunningham announced that she was going to support the Coalition on the floor of Parliament, leaving Goss with no alternative but to resign as Premier on 19 February 1996.

Goss&#x27; defeat proved to be a harbinger of federal Labor&#x27;s massive defeat in the federal election held a month later. Federal Labor suffered particularly heavy losses in Queensland at the subsequent federal election; it was cut down to only two seats there, its worst result in the state since being reduced to only one seat in 1975. Goss later said that Queensland voters had turned so violently on then-Prime Minister Paul Keating that they had been &quot;sitting on their verandas with baseball bats&quot; waiting for the writs to drop, a phrase that has since entered the Australian political lexicon.

===Resignation of leadership===
After resigning as Premier and Leader of the Labor Party on 19 February 1996, Goss returned to the back benches of the Opposition under new Opposition Leader Peter Beattie and assumed something of an &quot;elder statesman&quot; role. He had begun the process of seeking preselection as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Oxley in the 1998 election. However, a diagnosis of a brain tumour (uneventfully, partially removed) forced him to scale back his activities. Despite support from both sides of Parliament—evidenced when the House gave him a standing ovation on his return from surgery—Goss retired from politics at the 1998 Queensland state election.

==Post-political career==
After his retirement from politics, Goss served in a variety of community and business roles. He was awarded an MBA at the University of Queensland. Goss was also awarded honorary doctorates (DUniv) by QUT and Griffith University.

Goss was Chairman of the Queensland Art Gallery for 3 terms from 1999 until 2008, a period which included the development of the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA), and served a term as a Director of the Brisbane Broncos NRL rugby league team.

Goss received a Centenary Medal in 2001.

In business, Goss served as National Chairman of the Australian section of Deloitte from 2005 to 2013. Goss was also chairman of engineering firm Ausenco from 2002 until 2013. From 2003 to 2007, Goss was on the board of Ingeus Limited, the company founded by Thérèse Rein, the wife of former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, his former chief-of-staff. Further, Goss was Chairman of FreeTV Australia, the lobby group representing the free-to-air television companies in Australia, from 2008 until 2011.

Goss was also an Ambassador of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation, and a member of a business task force dealing with the aftermath of the 2010-11 Queensland floods.

==Family==
He lived in Brisbane with his wife, Roisin (née Hirschfeld). Roisin&#x27;s father was Konrad Hirschfeld (a Rhodes Scholar in 1927) and her grandfather Eugen Hirschfeld (a member of the first University of Queensland Senate in 1910). Wayne and Roisin Goss had two children, Ryan and Caitlin, both of whom attended the University of Queensland and were awarded Rhodes Scholarships to attend the University of Oxford in 2007 and 2009 respectively.

==Death, funeral and legacy==
Goss battled a recurrent brain tumour for 17 years, undergoing four operations to manage it. He died aged 63 at his home in Brisbane on 10 November 2014, with his wife and children present.

Condolence motions were moved in the Queensland Parliament and in the Parliament of Australia.

In marking Goss&#x27; death, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described Goss as Queensland&#x27;s &quot;greatest postwar Premier&quot;; former Premier Peter Beattie described Goss as &quot;Labor’s best premier since T. J. Ryan in 1915&quot;; former Premier Anna Bligh stated that &quot;Wayne Goss was the father of modern Queensland&quot;. The then Liberal National Premier Campbell Newman acknowledged Goss&#x27; &quot;amazing contribution to Queensland&quot;.

Instead of a state funeral, a private funeral was held, and a public memorial service was organised by the family at the upper level open spaces areas of the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art. Goss&#x27; wife Roisin shared recollections about his life as a private citizen and his favourite saying at family gatherings or just lounging outside on a sunny day: &quot;This Is Good&quot;. Close friend and former State Attorney-General, the Hon. Matt Foley gave a detailed testimonial about his friendship with Goss and their days in political office. Over a thousand mourners attended the service, some accommodated in overflow rooms with views to monitors and speakers.

A central building at the Griffith University Logan City campus is named after Goss in recognition of his work as an “education visionary”. The rainforest tree genus &quot;Gossia&quot; in the myrtle family is named after Wayne Goss in honour of his conservation work.

<text>In biology, polymorphism is the occurrence of two or more clearly different morphs or forms, also referred to as alternative &quot;phenotypes&quot;, in the population of a species. To be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a panmictic population (one with random mating).

Put simply, polymorphism is when there are two or more possibilities of a trait on a gene. For example, there is more than one possible trait in terms of a jaguar&#x27;s skin colouring; they can be light morph or dark morph. Due to having more than one possible variation for this gene, it is termed &#x27;polymorphism&#x27;. However, if the jaguar has only one possible trait for that gene, it would be termed &quot;monomorphic&quot;. For example, if there was only one possible skin colour that a jaguar could have, it would be termed monomorphic.

The term polyphenism can be used to clarify that the different forms arise from the same genotype. Genetic polymorphism is a term used somewhat differently by geneticists and molecular biologists to describe certain mutations in the genotype, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms that may not always correspond to a phenotype, but always corresponds to a branch in the genetic tree. See below.

Polymorphism is common in nature; it is related to biodiversity, genetic variation, and adaptation. Polymorphism usually functions to retain a variety of forms in a population living in a varied environment. The most common example is sexual dimorphism, which occurs in many organisms. Other examples are mimetic forms of butterflies (see mimicry), and human hemoglobin and blood types.

According to the theory of evolution, polymorphism results from evolutionary processes, as does any aspect of a species. It is heritable and is modified by natural selection. In polyphenism, an individual&#x27;s genetic makeup allows for different morphs, and the switch mechanism that determines which morph is shown is environmental. In genetic polymorphism, the genetic makeup determines the morph.

The term polymorphism also refers to the occurrence of structurally and functionally more than two different types of individuals, called zooids, within the same organism. It is a characteristic feature of cnidarians.
For example, &quot;Obelia&quot; has feeding individuals, the gastrozooids; the individuals capable of asexual reproduction only, the gonozooids, blastostyles; and free-living or sexually reproducing individuals, the medusae.

Balanced polymorphism refers to the maintenance of different phenotypes in population.

== Terminology ==

Monomorphism means having only one form. Dimorphism means having two forms.
* Polymorphism does not cover characteristics showing continuous variation (such as weight), though this has a heritable component. Polymorphism deals with forms in which the variation is discrete (discontinuous) or strongly bimodal or polymodal.
* Morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time; this excludes geographical races and seasonal forms. The use of the words &quot;morph&quot; or &quot;polymorphism&quot; for what is a visibly different geographical race or variant is common, but incorrect. The significance of geographical variation is that it may lead to allopatric speciation, whereas true polymorphism takes place in panmictic populations.
* The term was first used to describe visible forms, but it has been extended to include cryptic morphs, for instance blood types, which can be revealed by a test.
* Rare variations are not classified as polymorphisms, and mutations by themselves do not constitute polymorphisms. To qualify as a polymorphism, some kind of balance must exist between morphs underpinned by inheritance. The criterion is that the frequency of the least common morph is too high simply to be the result of new mutations or, as a rough guide, that it is greater than 1% (though that is far higher than any normal mutation rate for a single allele).

=== Nomenclature ===

Polymorphism crosses several discipline boundaries, including ecology, genetics, evolution theory, taxonomy, cytology, and biochemistry. Different disciplines may give the same concept different names, and different concepts may be given the same name. For example, there are the terms established in ecological genetics by E.B. Ford (1975), and for classical genetics by John Maynard Smith (1998). The shorter term morphism was preferred by the evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley (1955).

Various synonymous terms exist for the various polymorphic forms of an organism. The most common are morph and morpha, while a more formal term is morphotype. Form and phase are sometimes used, but are easily confused in zoology with, respectively, &quot;form&quot; in a population of animals, and &quot;phase&quot; as a color or other change in an organism due to environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.). Phenotypic traits and characteristics are also possible descriptions, though that would imply just a limited aspect of the body.

In the taxonomic nomenclature of zoology, the word &quot;morpha&quot; plus a Latin name for the morph can be added to a binomial or trinomial name. However, this invites confusion with geographically variant ring species or subspecies, especially if polytypic. Morphs have no formal standing in the ICZN. In botanical taxonomy, the concept of morphs is represented with the terms &quot;variety&quot;, &quot;subvariety&quot; and &quot;form&quot;, which are formally regulated by the ICN. Horticulturists sometimes confuse this usage of &quot;variety&quot; both with cultivar (&quot;variety&quot; in viticultural usage, rice agriculture jargon, and informal gardening lingo) and with the legal concept &quot;plant variety&quot; (protection of a cultivar as a form of intellectual property).

==Mechanisms==

Three mechanisms may cause polymorphism:
* Genetic polymorphism – where the phenotype of each individual is genetically determined
** An example of this can be seen in the blue-tailed damselfly (&quot;Ischnura elegans&quot;)
* A conditional development strategy, where the phenotype of each individual is set by environmental cues
* A mixed development strategy, where the phenotype is randomly assigned during development

== Relative frequency ==

Endler&#x27;s survey of natural selection gave an indication of the relative importance of polymorphisms among studies showing natural selection. The results, in summary: Number of species demonstrating natural selection: 141. Number showing quantitative traits: 56. Number showing polymorphic traits: 62. Number showing both Q and P traits: 23. This shows that polymorphisms are found to be at least as common as continuous variation in studies of natural selection, and hence just as likely to be part of the evolutionary process.

== Genetics ==

=== Genetic polymorphism ===
Since all polymorphism has a genetic basis, &quot;genetic polymorphism&quot; has a particular meaning:
* Genetic polymorphism is the simultaneous occurrence in the same locality of two or more discontinuous forms in such proportions that the rarest of them cannot be maintained just by recurrent mutation or immigration, originally defined by Ford (1940). The later definition by Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Bodmer (1971) is currently used: &quot;Genetic polymorphism is the occurrence in the same population of two or more alleles at one locus, each with appreciable frequency&quot;, where the minimum frequency is typically taken as 1%.

The definition has three parts: a) sympatry: one interbreeding population; b) discrete forms; and c) not maintained just by mutation.

In simple words, the term polymorphism was originally used to describe variations in shape and form that distinguish normal individuals within a species from each other. Presently, geneticists use the term genetic polymorphism to describe the functionally silent differences in DNA sequence between individuals that make each human genome unique.

Genetic polymorphism is actively and steadily maintained in populations by natural selection, in contrast to &quot;transient polymorphisms&quot; where a form is progressively replaced by another. By definition, genetic polymorphism relates to a balance or equilibrium between morphs. The mechanisms that conserve it are types of balancing selection.

=== Mechanisms of balancing selection ===
* Heterosis (or heterozygote advantage): &quot;Heterosis: the heterozygote at a locus is fitter than either homozygote&quot;.
* Frequency dependent selection: The fitness of a particular phenotype is dependent on its frequency relative to other phenotypes in a given population. Example: prey switching, where rare morphs of prey are actually fitter due to predators concentrating on the more frequent morphs.
* Fitness varies in time and space. Fitness of a genotype may vary greatly between larval and adult stages, or between parts of a habitat range.
* Selection acts differently at different levels. The fitness of a genotype may depend on the fitness of other genotypes in the population: this covers many natural situations where the best thing to do (from the point of view of survival and reproduction) depends on what other members of the population are doing at the time.

=== Pleiotropism ===

Most genes have more than one effect on the phenotype of an organism (pleiotropism). Some of these effects may be visible, and others cryptic, so it is often important to look beyond the most obvious effects of a gene to identify other effects. Cases occur where a gene affects an unimportant visible characteristic, yet a change in fitness is recorded. In such cases, the gene&#x27;s subsurface effects may be responsible for the change in fitness. Pleiotropism is posing continual challenges for many clinical dysmorphologists in their attempt to explain birth defects which affect one or more organ system, with only a single underlying causative agent. For many pleiotropic disorders, the connection between the genetic abnormality and its manifestations is neither apparent nor understood.
:&quot;If a neutral trait is pleiotropically linked to an advantageous one, it may emerge because of a process of natural selection. It was selected but this doesn&#x27;t mean it is an adaptation. The reason is that, although it was selected, there was no selection for that trait.&quot;

=== Epistasis ===

Epistasis occurs when the expression of one gene is modified by another gene. For example, gene A only shows its effect when allele B1 (at another locus) is present, but not if it is absent. This is one of the ways in which two or more genes may combine to produce a coordinated change in more than one characteristic (for instance, in mimicry). Unlike the supergene, epistatic genes do not need to be closely linked or even on the same chromosome.

Both pleiotropism and epistasis show that a gene need not relate to a character in the simple manner that was once supposed.

=== The origin of supergenes ===

Although a polymorphism can be controlled by alleles at a single locus (e.g. human ABO blood groups), the more complex forms are controlled by supergenes consisting of several tightly linked genes on a single chromosome. Batesian mimicry in butterflies and heterostyly in angiosperms are good examples. There is a long-standing debate as to how this situation could have arisen, and the question is not yet resolved.

Whereas a gene family (several tightly linked genes performing similar or identical functions) arises by duplication of a single original gene, this is usually not the case with supergenes. In a supergene some of the constituent genes have quite distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process might involve suppression of crossing-over, translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication. That crossing-over can be suppressed by selection has been known for many years.

Debate has centered round the question of whether the component genes in a super-gene could have started off on separate chromosomes, with subsequent reorganization, or if it is necessary for them to start on the same chromosome. Originally, it was held that chromosome rearrangement would play an important role. This explanation was accepted by E. B. Ford and incorporated into his accounts of ecological genetics.

However, many believe it more likely that the genes start on the same chromosome. They argue that supergenes arose &quot;in situ&quot;. This is known as Turner&#x27;s sieve hypothesis. John Maynard Smith agreed with this view in his authoritative textbook, but the question is still not definitively settled.

== Ecology ==

Selection, whether natural or artificial, changes the frequency of morphs within a population; this occurs when morphs reproduce with different degrees of success. A genetic (or balanced) polymorphism usually persists over many generations, maintained by two or more opposed and powerful selection pressures. Diver (1929) found banding morphs in &quot;Cepaea nemoralis&quot; could be seen in prefossil shells going back to the Mesolithic Holocene. Non-human apes have similar blood groups to humans; this strongly suggests that this kind of polymorphism is ancient, at least as far back as the last common ancestor of the apes and man, and possibly even further.
The relative proportions of the morphs may vary; the actual values are determined by the effective fitness of the morphs at a particular time and place. The mechanism of heterozygote advantage assures the population of some alternative alleles at the locus or loci involved. Only if competing selection disappears will an allele disappear. However, heterozygote advantage is not the only way a polymorphism can be maintained. Apostatic selection, whereby a predator consumes a common morph whilst overlooking rarer morphs is possible and does occur. This would tend to preserve rarer morphs from extinction.

Polymorphism is strongly tied to the adaptation of a species to its environment, which may vary in colour, food supply, and predation and in many other ways including sexual harassment avoidance. Polymorphism is one good way the opportunities get to be used; it has survival value, and the selection of modifier genes may reinforce the polymorphism. In addition, polymorphism seems to be associated with a higher rate of speciation.

=== Polymorphism and niche diversity ===

G. Evelyn Hutchinson, a founder of niche research, commented &quot;It is very likely from an ecological point of view that all species, or at least all common species, consist of populations adapted to more than one niche&quot;. He gave as examples sexual size dimorphism and mimicry. In many cases where the male is short-lived and smaller than the female, he does not compete with her during her late pre-adult and adult life. Size difference may permit both sexes to exploit different niches. In elaborate cases of mimicry, such as the African butterfly &quot;Papilio dardanus&quot;, female morphs mimic a range of distasteful models called Batesian mimicry, often in the same region. The fitness of each type of mimic decreases as it becomes more common, so the polymorphism is maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Thus the efficiency of the mimicry is maintained in a much increased total population. However it can exist within one gender.

Female-limited polymorphism in &quot;Papilio dardanus&quot; can be described as an outcome of sexual conflict. Cook et al. (1994) argued that the male-like phenotype in some females in &quot;P. dardanus&quot; population on Pemba Island, Tanzania functions to avoid detection from a mate-searching male. The researchers found that male mate preference is controlled by frequency-dependent selection, which means that the rare morph suffers less from mating attempt than the common morph. The reasons why females try to avoid male sexual harassment are that male mating attempt can reduce female fitness in many ways such as fecundity and longevity.

=== The switch ===

The mechanism which decides which of several morphs an individual displays is called the &quot;switch&quot;. This switch may be genetic, or it may be environmental. Taking sex determination as the example, in humans the determination is genetic, by the XY sex-determination system. In Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), sex determination is by haplo-diploidy: the females are all diploid, the males are haploid. However, in some animals an environmental trigger determines the sex: alligators are a famous case in point. In ants the distinction between workers and guards is environmental, by the feeding of the grubs. Polymorphism with an environmental trigger is called polyphenism.

The polyphenic system does have a degree of environmental flexibility not present in the genetic polymorphism. However, such environmental triggers are the less common of the two methods.

=== Investigative methods ===

Investigation of polymorphism requires use of both field and laboratory techniques. In the field:
* detailed survey of occurrence, habits and predation
* selection of an ecological area or areas, with well-defined boundaries
* capture, mark, release, recapture data
* relative numbers and distribution of morphs
* estimation of population sizes

And in the laboratory:
* genetic data from crosses
* population cages
* chromosome cytology if possible
* use of chromatography, biochemistry or similar techniques if morphs are cryptic

Without proper field-work, the significance of the polymorphism to the species is uncertain and without laboratory breeding the genetic basis is obscure. Even with insects, the work may take many years; examples of Batesian mimicry noted in the nineteenth century are still being researched.

== Relevance for evolutionary theory ==

Polymorphism was crucial to research in ecological genetics by E. B. Ford and his co-workers from the mid-1920s to the 1970s (similar work continues today, especially on mimicry). The results had a considerable effect on the mid-century evolutionary synthesis, and on present evolutionary theory. The work started at a time when natural selection was largely discounted as the leading mechanism for evolution, continued through the middle period when Sewall Wright&#x27;s ideas on drift were prominent, to the last quarter of the 20th century when ideas such as Kimura&#x27;s neutral theory of molecular evolution was given much attention. The significance of the work on ecological genetics is that it has shown how important selection is in the evolution of natural populations, and that selection is a much stronger force than was envisaged even by those population geneticists who believed in its importance, such as Haldane and Fisher.

In just a couple of decades the work of Fisher, Ford, Arthur Cain, Philip Sheppard and Cyril Clarke promoted natural selection as the primary explanation of variation in natural populations, instead of genetic drift. Evidence can be seen in Mayr&#x27;s famous book &quot;Animal Species and Evolution&quot;, and Ford&#x27;s &quot;Ecological Genetics&quot;. Similar shifts in emphasis can be seen in most of the other participants in the evolutionary synthesis, such as Stebbins and Dobzhansky, though the latter was slow to change.

Kimura drew a distinction between molecular evolution, which he saw as dominated by selectively neutral mutations, and phenotypic characters, probably dominated by natural selection rather than drift.
