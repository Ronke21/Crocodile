<text>is a Japanese singer from Amami Ōshima. She sings in the shima-uta style particular to that region, with distinctive falsetto effects.

==History==

===Early life===
Chitose Hajime began learning shamisen under her mother&#x27;s encouragement from a young age. At age 10 she began to pick up &quot;shima-uta&quot;, a style of singing passed down through generations.

She won many folk and other song competitions during her teens, traveling to events across Japan. She released two traditional folk albums on cassette on an indie label, the first at age 16, and at age 17 was approached by numerous record labels following a grand prize win at a local folk song contest. Stating in a later interview that she was &quot;suspicious of them&quot;, she decided not to join the labels or pursue music, and instead chose to study to become a beautician, following in the footsteps of her older sister. She moved to Osaka in 1997. However, she suffered from asthma and had severe allergic reactions to many of the chemicals used by beauticians. She withdrew from school, but before returning home to Amami Ōshima she contacted the artist management company Office Augusta, the only company that had gone all the way to visit her on her home island during the flurry to sign her at age 17.

===Music career===
In March 2001, she released a self-titled mini-album through Augusta Records. The album of cover versions included four English-language songs performed originally by Carole King, The Sugarcubes, Jimi Hendrix and Velvet Underground, but was so well received that Hajime was pushed to release another mini-album less than five months later. In August 2001, Chitose released her second mini-album with Augusta Records entitled , this time featuring five original tracks.

In 2002, she released her first major label single on Epic Records – (&quot;The Sea-God&#x27;s Tree&quot;). It was the third highest selling single of the year behind only Hikaru Utada&#x27;s &quot;traveling&quot;, and Ayumi Hamasaki&#x27;s &quot;H&quot;, selling an estimated 850,000 copies. Three months later, she released a brand new single, . While also very popular, it was not nearly the success that her first single was, although it did help to cement her as a permanent artist.

Her first major album, , followed later in the year. It sold 800,000 copies, charted for 57 weeks, and was the 16th highest selling album of the year.

She released three more singles before her second major album, , was released in 2003. Shortly after a concert tour, and the release of a live album and DVD in 2004, Hajime announced that she would be getting married, and was to have her first child in 2005.

She returned to the music industry in November 2005 with the single , the ending theme for the anime series &quot;BLOOD+&quot;. The single was a hit, reaching No. 12 on the Oricon charts. She followed this success with , the ending theme for the anime &quot;AYAKASHI – Japanese Classic Horror&quot;. The single sold 6,050 copies in its first week, and remained on the charts for seven weeks total. A third single, &quot;Ao no Requiem&quot; (青のレクイエ), was the theme song for the Studio GAGA film &quot;Hatsukoi&quot;. The following week, Hajime released her third original major album, . A limited edition version featured a 13th track, with Ryuichi Sakamoto), as well as a DVD containing the music videos for &quot;Kataritsugu Koto&quot;, and &quot;Haru no Katami&quot;.

Following , Hajime took an extended break to spend time with her family and moving to Okinawa. She returned in 2008 with the release of &quot;CASSINI&quot; (カッシーニ), based on the theme of family and bonding.

In August 2010 she released two albums simultaneously, the Japanese language &quot;Orient&quot; and the English language &quot;Occident&quot;.

==Influence==
Studies have revealed that her particular style of singing, including aspects of traditional Amami-Ōshima music, has a relaxing effect that has been observed in electroencephalograms taken from the brains of people listening to her singing.

<doc id="496191" wikidata="Q8017340" url="?curid=496191" title="William Ralph Meredith">
<text>Sir William Ralph Meredith, (March 31, 1840 – August 21, 1923) was a Canadian lawyer, politician and judge. He served as Leader of the Ontario Conservatives from 1878 to 1894, Chancellor of the University of Toronto from 1900 until his death, and Chief Justice of Ontario from 1913 until his death. Through his principles, known as the &quot;Meredith Principles&quot;, he is regarded as the founding father of the Workers&#x27; Compensation System in Ontario, the impact of which was felt throughout Canada and the United States.

==Background==

Born March 31, 1840, at Westminster Township, Upper Canada, he was the eldest son of John Walsingham Cooke Meredith and a member of a well-known legal family in Ireland and Canada. His middle name was for his great-grandfather, Ralph Meredith (1748–1799), Attorney Exchequer and Justice of the Peace for County Dublin.

William R. Meredith and his well-known brothers were collectively known as &quot;The Eight London Merediths&quot;, who included among them Chief Justice Richard Martin Meredith, Sir Vincent Meredith, Thomas Graves Meredith and Charles Meredith. The brothers were first cousins of The Rt. Hon. Richard Edmund Meredith, Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and Frederick Walsingham Meredith (1859–1924), President of the Law Society of Ireland. Meredith&#x27;s father was a first cousin of Chief Justice Sir William Collis Meredith, Edmund Allen Meredith and Sir James Creed Meredith. The last named was the father of Judge James Creed Meredith, uncle of Chief Justice Sir Herbert Ribton Meredith.

== Early career ==

Educated at home, he afterwards briefly attended Hellmuth College, the grammar school in London, Ontario. He articled with Thomas Scatcherd before winning a two-year scholarship to the University of Toronto to study law. At this time, he also served as an officer in the London Light Infantry militia. He was called to the Bar in 1861 and entered into partnership with Scatcherd. Not before long he was considered to be &quot;the acknowledged leader of the London Bar&quot;.

In 1871, he was elected a Bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and the following year, he was awarded his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto. 

In 1875, he became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (which became King&#x27;s Counsel on 22 January 1901 upon the death of Queen Victoria) . 

After the death of his legal partner, Thomas Scatcherd, he succeeded him as London&#x27;s city solicitor, a position another brother, Thomas Graves Meredith, would hold after him.

From 1879 to 1888, he served as the first president of the Middlesex Law Association. In 1888, he left London to take over William Alexander Foster&#x27;s successful law firm in Toronto. That same year saw him become an honorary member of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, which granted him an honorary Doctor of Laws in 1889.

== Political life ==

Meredith had entered politics in 1872 as a Conservative, when he succeeded Sir John Carling (whose daughter, Jessie, married his brother Thomas) as London&#x27;s representative to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. He was considered a radical by many Tories, but that did not prevent him being named deputy leader of the party in 1878. After the retirement of John Hillyard Cameron the following year, without even the formality of a ballot, he was chosen as the party&#x27;s leader. Charles Biggar, the biographer of Meredith&#x27;s chief political rival, Sir Oliver Mowat, wrote,

&quot;There was no man in the ranks of the Opposition upon whom the choice could more worthily have fallen... Always ready in debate, and judicial in the tone of his arguments, he was a generous and formidable opponent. Especially in Committee of the Whole House, where details of legislation are worked out and party issues are for the moment forgotten, Mr. Meredith&#x27;s services to the province were simply invaluable. His personal popularity was great. The &quot;Montreal Witness&quot;, a Liberal journal, declared him to be &#x27;perhaps the most popular public man personally we have ever had in Canada&#x27;; and the House testified its appreciation of his services by voting him a salary of $2,000 per annum, which, however he declined to accept.&quot;

However, he was actively against women&#x27;s rights, but that was somewhat counterbalanced by his progressive political philosophy towards the (albeit male) Native Americans, and the relief of male suffrage in his legislation in favour of worker&#x27;s rights. (See section on &quot;Workers&#x27; compensation and Meredith Principles&quot;.) Despite that and other successes under Meredith&#x27;s leadership, the Conservatives never reached power. Meredith saw his position as a part-time commitment (he had a full-time legal practice in Toronto) and Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s conservative hard-line approach caused Meredith many embarrassments. But, to a greater extent his lack of real political success was a direct result of the superior political skill of the Liberal leader in power, Sir Oliver Mowat.

Meredith&#x27;s disagreements with Macdonald culminated in his and his immediate friends refusing to take part in Macdonald&#x27;s electoral campaign of 1891. Considered as one of the best campaign orators, Meredith&#x27;s decision caused both shock and disappointment within the Tory ranks. Meredith saw Macdonald&#x27;s campaign, led by Sir Charles Tupper, as &quot;a slanderous crusade against his fellow countrymen&quot;.

Though the Merediths were Anglo-Irish, his paternal grandmother was from a prominent Catholic family in Ireland and so the Catholic population in Ontario had initially hailed Meredith as one of their own. However, in his later political years, Meredith felt that Mowat&#x27;s Liberals were granting &#x27;humiliating concessions&#x27; to the Catholic minority, and this led to his final political demise. As a matter of conscience and increasingly frustrated by Macdonald&#x27;s refusal to listen to him, Meredith launched an attack on what he saw as unfair advantages enjoyed by the separate Catholic schools. He denounced the Catholics&#x27; rights to a guaranteed seat on all secondary school boards and the use of unapproved texts in separate schools. In comparison to The Toronto Mail, his attacks were measured, but it was enough to draw the wrath of the Catholic population, which immediately swung their support firmly behind the Liberals.

==Judicial appointments==

His dispute with the Catholic Church led to another embarrassing electoral defeat, and the government in Ottawa now viewed him as a &quot;governmental impossibility&quot; in Ontario and decided it might be more prudent to put Meredith in a position that enabled him to put his real talents to work. In 1894, he retired from politics and accepted the position of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and of the Ontario High Court of Justice, and was knighted in that capacity two years later. In 1913, he was succeeded by one of his brothers, Richard Martin Meredith, and appointed Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Appeal. On the reorganization of the Ontario judiciary he was made Chief Justice of Ontario, in which office he died.

Meredith stuck rigidly to the doctrine of applying precedents, avoiding narrow or restrictive interpretations of the law. In his obituary, Toronto City Solicitor William Johnston praised him for being &#x27;one of the best versed judges in Municipal law.&#x27; Occasionally he found himself presiding over cases in which two of his brothers (Edmund and Richard) stood before him. In 1913, the &quot;Toronto World&quot; reported,

&quot;As a family the Merediths, whilst agreeable enough to those they meet have always held themselves aloof and have mixed little in society. In Sir William this characteristic is noticeable. He is a man with very few intimates. He has climbed to his present eminence by sheer ability, not by means of wirepulling. Kindly at heart and sympathetic, he is yet so sharp-witted that he cannot resist an occasional biting word or innuendo, a habit which has gained him not a few enemies. On the bench he is severe, demanding much from those who appear before him. He is in effect a judicial autocrat. In private life on the other hand he can be one of the most delightful of conversationalists with a rich store of knowledge and anecdote.&quot;

==Invitation to return to politics==

Though on the face of it, Meredith&#x27;s political career had been unsuccessful, when the powerfully persuasive Sir Charles Tupper became Prime Minister of Canada in 1896, he and the former Prime Minister, Sir Mackenzie Bowell, tried valiantly but in vain to persuade Meredith to leave the bench and join Tupper&#x27;s cabinet. In his book on Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Liberal Party, Sir John Willison writes of Meredith that &quot;there have been few more useful and honourable in our history, and it can hardly be questioned that if he had joined Sir Charles Tupper he would have sensibly improved the prospects of the Conservative party&quot;.

==Public service==

Outside of court Meredith still exercised great political influence, and his &quot;legislative and forensic skills were frequently enlisted by various governments&quot;. It was widely believed that Meredith was the political mentor of Sir James Whitney, and that he had a hand in framing some of the progressive measures put through by him. Meredith also mediated between Whitney and Sir Adam Beck, suggesting and even wording many of the bills that established the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. The &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; stated that Meredith&#x27;s &quot;revision of the statutes of Ontario was masterful&quot;.

In 1895, Meredith was appointed a Senator of the University of Toronto, and five years later he was unanimously elected Chancellor of that university, a position he held until his death. He was a member of the Royal Commission that investigated the affairs of the University of Toronto in 1905. He was also called upon to lead commissions into the causes for the collapse of the Farmer&#x27;s Bank of York, Upper Canada and to investigate the worth of the Canadian Northern Railway prior to its takeover by the government of Sir Arthur Meighen. He was President of the South African Memorial Association and joint Chairman of Toronto&#x27;s Civic Improvement Committee.

==Workers&#x27; compensation and Meredith Principles==

Sir William Meredith is regarded as the founding father of workers&#x27; compensation in Ontario and, by extension, Canada. As the Industrial Revolution created crowded factories and unsafe working conditions, injured workers and their families had few choices when it came to receiving benefits or compensation for their injuries.

The Government of Ontario realized that changes to the compensation laws were essential. In 1910, Sir James Whitney appointed Meredith to head the first Royal Commission to study workers&#x27; compensation systems throughout the world and to make recommendations. In his royal commission report, Meredith said that the true aim of compensation law was to provide for the workman and his dependents and prevent their becoming a charge upon their relatives or friends, or the community at large. He identified five basic principles for a compassionate compensation system, the most important of which was the idea of &#x27;no-fault insurance&#x27;. That meant that workers would give up their right to sue their employers in exchange for guaranteed no-fault income security in the event of a workplace injury. Also, employers would pay for the system in return for protection against liability.

In 1913, Meredith presented his recommendations and his draft legislation came into effect the following year. The impact of Meredith&#x27;s new system was felt throughout Canada and the United States and as such his five principal ideas (no-fault compensation, security of benefits, collective liability, exclusive jurisdiction and administration by independent boards) became known as and are still known as the &quot;Meredith Principles&quot;.

==Family and private life==

In 1862, Meredith married Mary Holmes (1842–1930), daughter of Marcus Holmes, Mayor of London, director of the London &amp; Lake Huron Railway Company and president of the Horticultural Society. The Merediths lived at 41 Binscarth Road in Rosedale, Toronto, and they were parents of three daughters and one son who lived to adulthood. Their eldest daughter, Maude, married William Thompson Ramsay, for whom Ramsay, Calgary is named. The next daughter, Constance, married George Armstrong Peters, and their daughter, Ruth Meredith Peters, married Claude Spaak, widower of Suzanne Spaak. The youngest daughter, Isabel, married Dr. James David Thorburn, son of James Thorburn. The Merediths&#x27; son, Major John Redmond Walsingham Meredith (1878–1916), married a daughter of I.F. Hellmuth but predeceased his parents in England during World War I, leaving two daughters.

&quot;The Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot; noted that, although severe, Meredith was considered dignified and courteous on the bench, and he was affectionately known as &#x27;The Chief&#x27; among his fellow judges. Like most of his brothers, his favorite pastime was gardening. In 1913, &quot;The Toronto World&quot; reported:

&quot;Despite his seventy three years, Sir William is still a fine, erect and handsome man. His favorite pastime is gardening and in his beautiful grounds in Rosedale he spends much time. Donning a straw hat and gloves he delights to move about among his plants and bushes, weeding and clipping, or else to dig out dandelion roots from his lawn. Even in this pursuit he shows himself a man of solitary habits.&quot;

Following a swim off the coast of Maine, Meredith became ill and died a few weeks later whilst staying with relatives in Montreal. He and his wife are interred at the St. James Cemetery in Toronto.

<doc id="496211" wikidata="Q3853975" url="?curid=496211" title="Mego Corporation">
<text>Mego Corporation () is an American toy company that in its original iteration was first founded in 1954. Originally known as a purveyor of dime store toys, in 1971 the company shifted direction and became famous for producing licensed action figures (including the long running &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Super Heroes&quot; line), celebrity dolls, and the Micronauts toy line. For a time in the 1970s, their line of 8-inch-scale action figures with interchangeable bodies became the industry standard.

In 1982 Mego filed for bankruptcy, and by 1983, the Mego Corporation ceased to exist; today, Mego action figures and playsets can be highly prized collectibles, with some fetching hundreds, or even in some cases, thousands of dollars (depending on rarity) in the collectibles market.

In July 2018, the newly-reformed Mego Corporation announced they would be producing a limited run of their classic style clothed dolls in their traditional 1/9 scale, as well as some 1/5 figures sold exclusively through Target. These dolls, which include recreations of action figures released in the 1970s, began seeing release later in the year.

==Corporate history==
Mego was founded in 1954 by D. David Abrams and Madeline Abrams. The company thrived in the 1950s and early 1960s as an importer of dime store toys until the rising cost of newspaper advertising forced Mego to change its business model. In 1971, the Abrams&#x27;s son Martin, a recent business school graduate, was named company president.

Under Martin Abrams&#x27;s direction, the company shifted its production to dolls with interchangeable bodies. Generic bodies could be mass-produced and different dolls created by interposing different heads and costumes on them.

In 1972 Mego secured the licenses to create toys for both National Periodical Publications (DC Comics) and Marvel Comics. The popularity of this line of 8&quot; dolls—dubbed &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Super Heroes&quot;—created the standard action-figure scale for the 1970s.

Mego began to purchase the license rights of motion pictures, television programs, and comic books, eventually producing doll lines for &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;. Mego also obtained licenses from Edgar Rice Burroughs for his creations, such as Tarzan.

Beginning in 1974 Mego released the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; action-figures, the first such toys sold as film tie-ins. 1975 saw the release of figures from &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, which was steadily gaining fandom in syndication. The &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; figures proved popular and inspired the rise of action figure series based on popular culture franchises.

During this period, Mego was known for the lavish parties the company threw at the annual New York American International Toy Fair. In 1975, Mego launched its &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; film dolls with a gala whose special guests were every surviving member of the film&#x27;s main cast. Mego&#x27;s party at the Waldorf-Astoria with Sonny and Cher introducing their dolls drew a thousand people. Both dolls were formally unveiled on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. The Cher doll was the number-1-selling doll in 1976, helping to make Mego the sixth-ranked American toy manufacturer, based on retail sales.

In 1976, Martin Abrams hashed out a deal with the Japanese toy manufacturer Takara to bring their popular lucite 3&quot; fully articulated Microman figures to the United States under the name &quot;Micronauts.&quot; While Marty was in Japan, Fox&#x27;s lawyer Mark Peders dropped by the office to show stills from the upcoming motion picture &quot;Star Wars&quot;, but no one in the office could sign the deal, so Peders visited Kenner in the same building and Kenner president Bernie Loomis was in the office and signed the deal. This decision seemed of little consequence to Mego at first, because the Micronauts figures initially sold well, earning the company more than $30 million at their peak. On the other hand, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film was extremely popular and competitor Kenner Products sold substantial numbers of &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures.

Following &quot;Star Wars&quot;&#x27; huge cultural impact, and Kenner&#x27;s great success with its action figure line, Mego negotiated licenses for the manufacturing rights to a host of science fiction motion pictures and television shows, including &quot;Moonraker&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. Although these lines of Mego dolls were of much higher quality than Kenner&#x27;s 12&quot; &quot;Star Wars&quot; figures, none were as successful. The widespread success of Kenner&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; 3-3/4&quot; toy line soon made the newer, smaller size the industry standard, shifting sales away from the 8&quot; standard popularized by Mego.

In the late 1970s, Mego was earning about $100 million in sales. Around this time, Mego began shifting their focus toward electronic toys like the 2-XL toy robot and the Fabulous Fred hand-held game player, but sales were not commensurate with the company&#x27;s investment, and Mego went deeply into debt. Other problems included a rat infestation in Mego&#x27;s warehouse and a lawsuit from Kenner over illegal appropriation of trade secrets related to the manufacture of their stretch figures. In the fiscal years 1980 and 1981, Mego reported combined losses of $40 million. In fiscal year 1982, the company reported losses of between $18 and $20 million.

In February 1982 the remaining staff was let go and the Mego offices were closed. On June 14, 1982, Mego filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; the company officially went under in 1983.

In 1986, Martin Abrams co-founded Abrams Gentile Entertainment (AGE), in order to retain and manage Mego&#x27;s licensing contracts, rights and deals. In October 1995 AGE attempted to reclaim the Mego trademark. In March 2002, they abandoned the effort. In early 2009, Martin Abrams announced that AGE had reclaimed the rights to the name Mego.

Mego Corporation is headquartered in Great Neck, NY, with manufacturing facilities in China and Mexico. In July 2018, Mego Corporation premiered an exclusive line
with Target stores of their classic 8 inch clothed action figures as well as several 14 inch DC Superheroes figures at San Diego Comic-Con with Joe Namath on hand to autograph his own 14 inch action figure. The Target exclusive featured three waves of figures hitting Target stores in August, October, and November. These figures were limited to 10,000 of each character.

Starting in 2019, Mego has continued to work with Target and other major retailers like Wal-Mart to bring the classic Star Trek, monsters, celebrities, and superheroes back to store shelves and on-line. Mego created action figures from the iconic &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; movie, giving fans of that 1982 classic the Mego figures they expected to see back then. Mego has also expanded distribution internationally, working with distributors in other countries to bring the magic of Mego to the rest of the world as well.

In 2020 Mego launched new waves of action figures and products with the help of Dr. Mego (Paul Clarke) to a wide audience via Target Corporation stores around the United States; Marty Abrams is greeting old and new fans at comic-cons and conventions nationwide.

==Products history==
===Fighting Yank===
A toy similar to GI Joe; so similar, in fact, that Hasbro was able to show that the toy&#x27;s body had been copied directly from authentic GI Joe tooling. Hasbro threatened a lawsuit and Mego discontinued the product.

===Broadway Joe Namath===
An action doll based on New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath. The 1970s toyline included Broadway Joe in New York Jets football uniform, plus additional fashions sold separately.

===Action Jackson===

One of Mego&#x27;s first toys under Martin Adams was an original character, Action Jackson, meant to compete with Hasbro&#x27;s popular G.I. Joe line. Heavily promoted on television commercials and in newspaper advertisements, the Action Jackson line included dolls, vehicles, and playsets. It was a big seller on its 1971 launch, but soon faded in popularity and was discontinued after 1974. The body design was reused for 8-inch licensed dolls.

===Dinah Mite===
A fashion doll produced as a female counterpart to Action Jackson. The doll was not a success, but the body design was reused for 8-inch licensed female dolls.

===World&#x27;s Greatest Super Heroes!===
Beginning in 1972, Mego released the first comprehensive line of DC Comics and Marvel Comics superhero and villain dolls, coining the term &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Super Heroes!&quot; (WGSH) as an umbrella title for all the dolls released in this line. To start the line, Mego produced Batman, Robin, Aquaman, and Superman dolls. (For the South African market, a local radio play hero, Jet Jungle, was included in the series.) The earliest dolls were released in a solid box, but these boxes were often damaged by shoppers who wanted to see the figure inside. The design was quickly changed to a &quot;window&quot; style box. The WGSH line was offered from 1972 until 1983.

===Fashion dolls===
Mego marketed various fashion doll lines designed to compete with Mattel&#x27;s popular Barbie line. The company&#x27;s first attempt was the 1973 &quot;Maddie Mod&quot; line, which included an extensive wardrobe and Maddie&#x27;s boyfriend &quot;Richie,&quot; was not a success. Next, Mego created &quot;Dinah-Mite,&quot; a poseable eight-inch (203 mm) scale Barbie-like doll with a boyfriend named Don. Other fashion dolls included &quot;Beautiful Lainie,&quot; a 19&quot; doll that danced back and forth from the hips; and Candi, a line that included &quot;Coppertone Candi,&quot; a &quot;tanning&quot; doll co-branded with Coppertone sunscreen.

===TV and movie dolls===
The popularity of the 1974 releases of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; lines led Mego to produce a variety of licensed figures based on films and TV shows, including &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Our Gang&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;The Waltons&quot;, and &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;.
Mego introduced a Lynda Carter &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; doll line in 1977. The first edition of the Wonder Woman dolls and accessories included:
* Wonder Woman (factory-painted bustier top with cloth star-spangled bottoms, bracelets, golden lasso, tiara, and red boots), as well as a Diana Prince Navy Yeoman outfit, featuring black glasses and black high-heeled shoes
* Nubia, Wonder Woman&#x27;s super-foe
* Queen Hippolyta, Wonder Woman&#x27;s mother 
* Major Steve Trevor, Wonder Woman&#x27;s best friend and boss

Mego added 12-inch dolls from the &quot;Superman&quot; movie in 1978, which included Superman, Jor-El, Lex Luthor, and General Zod.

In the early 1980s Mego produced dolls and vehicles for the popular TV shows &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, and &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;. The &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; dolls sold well, but Mego failed with its &quot;CHiPs&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot; dolls.

=== Comic Action Heroes! ===
Always thinking of ways to reduce costs of production, in 1975 Mego released a smaller plastic line of action toys called Comic Action Heroes! that had the costumes molded onto the figure (and later adopted by Star Wars and Super Powers lines), thus eliminating the extra cost of creating the suits. The line featured Batman, Robin, The Joker, and The Penguin, as well as other DC Comics characters, and Marvel characters such as Spider-Man, Captain America, and the Hulk. Later, in 1979, Mego re-released the line under the new name Pocket Super Heroes.

===Celebrity dolls===
In 1976, Mego launched a highly successful -inch celebrity doll line. The first dolls were Sonny and Cher, with famed fashion designer Bob Mackie designing an extensive wardrobe for Cher. Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, Diana Ross, Suzanne Somers, Captain and Tennille, and Kiss celebrity dolls followed in 1977 and 1978.

===Micronauts===

From 1976 to 1980 Mego produced a licensed line of Takara&#x27;s Microman figures under the name Micronauts. The 3-3/4&quot; toy line&#x27;s popularity led Marvel Comics to launch a &quot;Micronauts&quot; comic book in 1979, which ran until 1986.

===2-XL robot===

In 1978, Martin Abrams purchased inventor Michael J. Freeman&#x27;s toy robot, the 2-XL, which was introduced to the public and became a success. The toy was sold in different countries and was voiced in seven languages, including English. 2-XL was a revolutionary idea, combining toys and education. A lot of games were also developed for the toy. By 1981, the 2-XL&#x27;s popularity had waned, and it was later discontinued. However, the 2-XL robot was upgraded and reintroduced in the early 1990s by Tiger Electronics, a US based toy company. The programs for this version were also voiced by Freeman and sold worldwide.

The 2-XL was part of Mego&#x27;s electronic games line, which included the handheld devices Mini-Vid and Fabulous Fred.

===Military dolls===
In 1976, Mego began producing a small collection of World War II-themed military dolls marketed in France, Italy (under the Polistil name), Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom under different names. Most of these products were branded under the &quot;Lion Rock&quot; name, Mego&#x27;s manufacturing arm. These dolls were released in United States the early 1980s as &quot;Johnny Action&quot; or &quot;Combat Man.&quot; Using the format, they were produced after the G.I. Joe dolls had lost their popularity and before the revival of the G.I. Joe line in -inch format; they were also intended to compete with Spain&#x27;s Madelman line of soldier dolls. The combat line was not a success.

===Eagle Force===

One of Mego&#x27;s final large product lines was Eagle Force, a die-cast action figure toy line co-designed by Paul Kirchner and marketed in 1981-1982. Produced during Ronald Reagan&#x27;s first term as president, the Eagle Force toy line was marketed as a counter-terrorist task force, to send the message that the United States wasn&#x27;t going to be &quot;pushed around&quot; anymore.
The line was similar to Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero dolls.

===Reissued Marx playsets===
Mego acquired the moulds of World War II soldiers, vehicles and landscape terrain from Louis Marx and Company, reissuing their Battleground (1980) and Navarone (1981) playsets. Mego also reissued a Prehistoric Dinosaur, Fort Apache and Galaxy Command playsets.

==&quot;Mego Melt&quot;==
Several different (but not all) plastic dolls made by Mego have suffered from &quot;Mego Melt&quot; (also known as &quot;Mego Molt&quot;), a term coined by toy collectors to describe the material deteriorating over time. The plastic used for the doll&#x27;s torso reacts with the rubberized plastic used for the arms and legs. The result is a melting of the torso at those joining points: shoulder, underarm, hips, and buttocks. Even when stored carefully, this melting often results in the costumes becoming stuck to the dolls. Excessive heat from storage in hot attics or garages exacerbates this problem. The dolls&#x27; hair and eyelashes are prone to similar deterioration when exposed to high temperatures.

==In popular culture==
From 1996–2011, Mego&#x27;s dolls, particularly the superhero line, found new life in &quot;Twisted ToyFare Theater&quot; (originally called &quot;Twisted Mego Theatre&quot;), a humorous photo comic strip appearing in &quot;ToyFare&quot;, a monthly magazine published by Wizard Entertainment. &quot;ToyFare&quot; staff posed and took photos depicting the dolls in bizarre situations, with added dialogue balloons. The series was well known in comic book and collectors&#x27; circles for its distinctive, off-the-wall sense of humor. The popular strips were later published separately in their own collections.

Mego dolls as well as similarly styled figures are used in sexually perverted adult oriented situations in the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim program &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. The show, which debuted in February 2005, is directly based on &quot;Twisted ToyFare Theater&quot; and features three of its writers.

<text>Henry Rowe Schoolcraft (March 28, 1793 – December 10, 1864) was an American geographer, geologist, and ethnologist, noted for his early studies of Native American cultures, as well as for his 1832 expedition to the source of the Mississippi River. He is also noted for his major six-volume study of Native Americans commissioned by Congress and published in the 1850s.

He served as United States Indian agent in Michigan for a period beginning in 1822. During this period, he named several newly organized counties, often creating neologisms that he claimed were derived from indigenous languages.

There he married Jane Johnston, daughter of a prominent Scotch-Irish fur trader and an Ojibwe mother, who was the high-ranking daughter of Waubojeeg, a war chief. Jane lived with her family in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. She was bilingual and educated, having grown up in a literate household. Jane taught Schoolcraft the Ojibwe language and much about her maternal culture. They had several children together, only two of whom survived past childhood. She is now recognized for her poetry and other writings as the first Native American literary writer in the United States.

Schoolcraft continued to study Native American tribes and publish works about them. In 1833, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

By 1846, Jane had died. That year, Schoolcraft was commissioned by Congress for a major study, known as &quot;Indian Tribes of the United States&quot;. It was published in six volumes from 1851 to 1857, and illustrated by Seth Eastman, a career Army officer with extensive experience as an artist of indigenous peoples.

Schoolcraft remarried in 1847, to Mary Howard, from a slaveholding family in South Carolina. In 1860, Howard published the bestselling novel &quot;The Black Gauntlet&quot;. It was part of the Anti-Tom literature that was written in Southern response to the bestselling &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; by Northern abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe.

== Early life and education ==
Schoolcraft was born in 1793 in Guilderland, Albany County, New York, the son of Lawrence Schoolcraft and Margaret-Anne Barbara (née Rowe) Schoolcraft. He entered Union College at age 15 and later attended Middlebury College. He was especially interested in geology and mineralogy.

His father was a glassmaker, and Schoolcraft initially studied and worked in the same industry. At age 24, he wrote his first paper on the topic, &quot;Vitreology&quot; (1817). After working in several glassworks in New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire, the young Schoolcraft left the family business at age 25 to explore the western frontier.

==Exploration and geologic survey==
From November 18 to February 1819, Schoolcraft and his companion Levi Pettibone made an expedition from Potosi, Missouri, to what is now Springfield. They traveled further down the White River into Arkansas, making a survey of the geography, geology, and mineralogy of the area. Schoolcraft published this study in &quot;A View of the Lead Mines of Missouri&quot; (1819). In this book, he correctly identified the potential for lead deposits in the region. Missouri eventually became the number one lead-producing state. (French colonists had earlier developed a lead mine outside St. Louis in the 18th century.) He also published &quot;Journal of a Tour into the Interior of Missouri and Arkansaw&quot; (1821), the first written account of a European-American exploration of the Ozark Mountains.

This expedition and his resulting publications brought Schoolcraft to the attention of John C. Calhoun, the Secretary of War, who considered him &quot;a man of industry, ambition, and insatiable curiosity.&quot; Calhoun recommended Schoolcraft to the Michigan Territorial Governor, Lewis Cass, for a position on an expedition led by Cass to explore the wilderness region of Lake Superior and the lands west to the upper Mississippi River. Beginning in the spring of 1820, Schoolcraft served as a geologist on the Lewis Cass expedition. Beginning in Detroit, they traveled nearly along Lake Huron and Lake Superior, west to the Mississippi River, down the river to present-day Iowa, and then returning to Detroit after tracing the shores of Lake Michigan.

The expedition was intended to establish the source of the Mississippi River. It was also intended to settle the question of the yet undetermined boundary between the United States and British Canada. The expedition traveled as far upstream as Upper Red Cedar Lake in present-day Minnesota. Since low water precluded navigating farther upstream, the expedition designated the lake as the river&#x27;s headwaters and renamed it in honor of Cass. (Schoolcraft noted, however, that locals informed the expedition that it was possible to navigate by canoe farther upstream earlier in the year when water levels were higher.) Schoolcraft&#x27;s account of the expedition was published as &quot;A Narrative Journal of Travels Through the Northwestern Regions...to the Sources of the Mississippi River&quot; (1821).

In 1821, he was a member of another government expedition, which traveled through Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. In 1832, he led a second expedition to the headwaters of the Mississippi River. While traveling alongside the Brule River, he met Ozaawindib, an Ojibwe agokwa, and hired her as a guide. Because they arrived at Cass Lake a month earlier than had the 1820 expedition, the group was able to take advantage of higher water to navigate to Lake Itasca. Ozaawindib successfully led the group to the headwater of the Mississippi, named Omashkoozo-Zaaga’igan or Elk Lake in Ojibwe. Schoolcraft renamed the headwater Lake Itasca based on the Latin words for truth (veritas) and head (caput).

==Marriages and family==
Schoolcraft met his first wife Jane Johnston soon after being assigned in 1822 to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, as the first US Indian agent in the region. Two years before, the government had built Fort Brady and wanted to establish an official presence to forestall any renewed British threat following the War of 1812. The government tried to ensure against British agitation of the Ojibwa.

Jane was the eldest daughter of John Johnston, a prominent Scots-Irish fur trader, and his wife &quot;Ozhaguscodaywayquay&quot; (Susan Johnston), daughter of a leading Ojibwe chief, &quot;Waubojeeg,&quot; and his wife. Both of the Johnstons were of high status; they had eight children together, and their cultured, wealthy family was well known in the area.

Jane was also known as &quot;Bamewawagezhikaquay&quot; (Woman of the Sound the Stars Make Rushing Through the Sky). Her knowledge of the Ojibwe language and culture, which she shared with Schoolcraft, formed in part the source material for Longfellow&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;.

Jane and Henry had four children together:
* William Henry (June 1824 – March 1827) died of croup at nearly three. Jane Schoolcraft wrote poems expressing her grief about his loss.
* stillborn daughter (November 1825).
* Jane Susan Ann (October 14, 1827 – November 25, 1892, Richmond, Virginia), called Janee.
* John Johnston (October 2, 1829 – April 24, 1864), served in the Civil War but was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg and disabled. He died at the age of 34 in Elmira, New York.
The Schoolcrafts sent Jane and John to a boarding school in Detroit for part of their education. Jane at 11 could handle the transition, but John at nine had a more difficult time and missed his parents.

The Schoolcrafts had a literary marriage, producing a family magazine. They included their own poetry in letters to each other through the years. Jane suffered from frequent illnesses. She died in 1842, while visiting a sister in Canada, and was buried at St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church, Ancaster, Ontario.

On January 12, 1847, after moving to Washington, DC, at age 53 Schoolcraft married again, to Mary Howard (died March 12, 1878). She was a southerner and slaveholder, from an elite planter family of the Beaufort district of South Carolina. Her support of slavery and opposition to mixed-race unions created strains in her relationship with the Schoolcraft children. They became alienated from both her and their father.

After Schoolcraft&#x27;s hands became paralyzed in 1848 from a rheumatic condition, Mary devoted much of her attention to caring for him and helping him complete his massive study of Native Americans, which had been commissioned by Congress in 1846.

In 1860, she published the novel &quot;The Black Gauntlet: A Tale of Plantation Life in South Carolina&quot; (which she said her husband had encouraged). One of many pro-slavery books published in response to Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s bestselling &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, such defenses of slavery, published in the decade before the American Civil War, became known as the anti-Tom genre. Hers became a best-seller, although not on the scale of Stowe&#x27;s.

==Indian agent==

Schoolcraft began his ethnological research in 1822 during his appointment as US Indian agent at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. He had responsibility for tribes in what is now northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. From his wife Jane Johnston, Schoolcraft learned the Ojibwe language, as well as much of the lore of the tribe and its culture.

Schoolcraft created &quot;The Muzzeniegun, or Literary Voyager&quot;, a family magazine which he and Jane produced in the winter of 1826–1827 and circulated among friends (&quot;muzzeniegun&quot; coming from Ojibwe &quot;mazina&#x27;igan&quot; meaning &quot;book&quot;). It contained mostly his own writings, although he did include a few pieces from his wife and a few other locals. Although they produced only single issues, each was distributed widely to residents in Sault Ste. Marie, then to Schoolcraft&#x27;s friends in Detroit, New York, and other eastern cities. Jane Johnston Schoolcraft used the pen names of &quot;Rosa&quot; and &quot;Leelinau&quot; as personae to write about different aspects of Indian culture.

Schoolcraft was elected to the legislature of the Michigan Territory, where he served from 1828 to 1832. In 1832, he traveled again to the upper reaches of the Mississippi to settle continuing troubles between the Ojibwe and Dakota (Sioux) nations. He worked to talk to as many Native American leaders as possible to maintain the peace. He was also provided with a surgeon and given instructions to begin vaccinating Native Americans against smallpox. He determined that smallpox had been unknown among the Ojibwe before the return in 1750 of a war party that had contact with Europeans on the East Coast. They had gone to Montreal to assist the French against the British in the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War).

During the voyage, Schoolcraft took the opportunity to explore the region, making the first accurate map of the Lake District around western Lake Superior. Following the lead of Ozawindib, an Ojibwe guide, Schoolcraft encountered the true headwaters of the Mississippi River, a lake that the natives called &quot;Omushkos&quot;, meaning Elk Lake. which Schoolcraft renamed Lake Itasca, a name which he coined from the Latin words &quot;veritas meaning &#x27;truth&#x27; and caput&quot; meaning &#x27;head&#x27;. The nearby Schoolcraft River, the first major tributary of the Mississippi, was later named in his honor. United States newspapers widely covered this expedition. Schoolcraft followed up with a personal account of the discovery with his book, &quot;Narrative of an Expedition Through the Upper Mississippi River to Itasca Lake&quot; (1834).

After his territory for Indian Affairs was greatly increased in 1833, Schoolcraft and his wife Jane moved to Mackinac Island, the new headquarters of his administration. In 1836, he was instrumental in settling land disputes with the Ojibwe. He worked with them to accomplish the Treaty of Washington (1836), by which they ceded to the United States a vast territory of more than 13 million acres (53,000 km2), worth many millions of dollars. He believed that the Ojibwe would be better off learning to farm and giving up their wide hunting lands. The government agreed to pay subsidies and provide supplies while the Ojibwe made a transition to a new way of living, but its provision of the promised subsidies was often late and underfunded. The Ojibwe suffered as a result.

In 1838 pursuant to the terms of the treaty, Schoolcraft oversaw the construction of the Indian Dormitory on Mackinac Island. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It provided temporary housing to the Ojibwe who came to Mackinac Island to receive annuities during their transition to what was envisioned by the US government as a more settled way of life.

In 1839 Schoolcraft was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Northern Department. He began a series of Native American studies later published as the &quot;Algic Researches&quot; (2 vols., 1839). These included his collection of Native American stories and legends, many of which his wife Jane Johnston Schoolcraft told him or translated for him from her culture.

While in Michigan, Schoolcraft became a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan in its early years. In this position he helped establish the state university&#x27;s financial organization.

==Founding magazines==
Schoolcraft founded and contributed to the first United States journal on public education, &quot;The Journal of Education.&quot; He also published &quot;The Souvenir of the Lakes&quot;, the first literary magazine in Michigan.

==Naming places==
Schoolcraft named many of Michigan&#x27;s counties and locations within the former Michigan Territory. He named Leelanau County, Michigan after his wife&#x27;s pen name of &quot;Leelinau&quot;. For those counties established in 1840, he made elisions – the process of joining or merging morphemes that contained abstract ideas from multiple languages – to form unique place names he considered as never previously used in North America. In names such as Alcona, Algoma, Allegan, Alpena, Arenac, Iosco, Kalkaska, Leelanau, Lenawee, Oscoda, and Tuscola, for example, Schoolcraft combined words and syllables from Native American languages with words and syllables from Latin and Arabic. Lake Itasca, the source lake of the Mississippi River, is another example of his eliding Native American and Latin morphemes. In 1843 the unique names of six counties named in 1840 after Native Michigan chiefs were erased – Kautawaubet County, Kaykakee County, Keskkauko County, Meegisee County, Mikenauk County, and Tonedagana County. But none of the 1840 counties with unique Schoolcraft elisions were changed.

==Later years==

When the Whig Party came to power in 1841 with the election of William Henry Harrison, Schoolcraft lost his political position as Indian agent. He and Jane moved to New York. She died the next year during a visit with a sister in Canada, while Schoolcraft was traveling in Europe.

He continued to write about Native Americans. In 1846 Congress commissioned him to develop a comprehensive reference work on American Indian tribes. Schoolcraft traveled to England to request the services of George Catlin to illustrate his proposed work, as the latter was widely regarded as the premier illustrator of Indian life. Schoolcraft was deeply disappointed when Catlin refused. Schoolcraft later engaged the artist Seth Eastman, a career Army officer, as illustrator. An Army captain and later brigadier general, Eastman was renowned for his paintings of Native American peoples. He had two extended assignments at Fort Snelling in present-day Minnesota, the second time as commander of the fort, and had closely studied, drawn and painted the people of the Indian cultures of the Great Plains.

Schoolcraft worked for years on the history and survey of the Indian tribes of the United States. It was published in six volumes from 1851 to 1857 by J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. of Philadelphia. Critics praised its scholarship and valuable content by Schoolcraft, and the meticulous and knowledgeable illustrations by Eastman. Critics also noted the work&#x27;s shortcomings, including a lack of index, and poor organization, which made the information almost inaccessible. Almost 100 years later, in 1954, the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution prepared and published an index to the volumes. (It was not until 1928 that the US government conducted another overall study of the conditions of American Indians; it was informally known as the &quot;Meriam Report&quot;, after the technical director of the team, Lewis Meriam.)

Schoolcraft died in Washington, D.C., on December 10, 1864. After his death, Schoolcraft&#x27;s second wife Mary donated over 200 books from his library, which had been published in 35 different Native American languages, to the Boston Athenæum. Schoolcraft and Mary were each buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, DC. His papers are archived in the Library of Congress.

Schoolcraft was the granduncle of Vice President James S. Sherman.

<text>Ira William McCollum Jr. (born July 12, 1944) is an American lawyer and Republican Party politician. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 2001, representing Florida&#x27;s 5th congressional district, which was later redistricted to the 8th congressional district in 1993. As a member of the House, McCollum rose to become Vice Chairman of the House Republican Conference, the fifth-highest ranking position in the House Republican leadership. He voted to impeach President Bill Clinton and subsequently took a leadership role in managing Clinton&#x27;s trial in the Senate, which ended in acquittal.

McCollum was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in 2000, hoping to replace the retiring Republican Connie Mack III, losing to Democratic nominee Bill Nelson. McCollum ran for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate again in 2004 but lost to Mel Martínez. In 2006 he was elected Florida Attorney General and in 2010 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of Florida, losing to businessman Rick Scott.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Brooksville, Florida, McCollum graduated from Hernando High School and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree and J.D. degree from the University of Florida. While at the University of Florida, he was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame, the most prestigious honor a student leader could receive, was a member of The Board, and served as president of Florida Blue Key.

McCollum&#x27;s professional career began in 1969 with the United States Navy&#x27;s Judge Advocate General Corps where he served on active duty until 1972. McCollum was an officer for more than 23 years before retiring from the United States Naval Reserve as a Commander (O-5) in the JAG Corps in 1992. In 1973, he entered private practice in Orlando and became involved in local politics, serving as Chairman of the Seminole County Republican Party from 1976 to 1980.

==Congressional career==

In 1980 McCollum was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from a district including Walt Disney World and most of Orlando. He defeated incumbent Representative Richard Kelly in the Republican primary.

While in Congress, McCollum founded the House Republican Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, chairing it for six years. He also served three terms on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, two of which as chairman of its Subcommittee on Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence. Additionally, McCollum served as vice chairman of the House Banking Committee and served on the Judiciary Committee, where he was chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime.

While serving the House, McCollum was also selected for a variety of Republican leadership positions, including three terms as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. McCollum gained national attention as one of 15 members selected to serve on the House Committee to Investigate the Iran-Contra Affair, and, in 1998–1999, as one of the House managers (prosecutors) in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.

==U.S. Senate elections==
Rather than seek reelection to the House in 2000, McCollum ran unsuccessfully for an open United States Senate seat, bringing to an end his 20-year Congressional career.

McCollum ran again in 2004, seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Senator Bob Graham. He was defeated in the Republican primary by HUD Secretary Mel Martinez, who went on to win the seat.

McCollum served as a partner with the Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP law firm, practicing in the federal policy area. In addition to his duties as the state&#x27;s chief legal officer, he serves as president and chairman of the Healthy Florida Foundation, chartered in 2002 to find consensus on long-term solutions to the nation&#x27;s health care system. He is a member of the North Florida Committee on Foreign Relations. He is also a board member of the James Madison Institute.

==Florida Attorney General==

In 2006, McCollum ran for Florida Attorney General, defeating State Senator Skip Campbell in the general election.

McCollum led a group of Attorneys General in filing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Obamacare. He also filed a brief in support of Arizona&#x27;s immigration law.

McCollum opposed the federal Stimulus bill, as well as the $20 billion federal oil fund that limited his office&#x27;s ability to pursue claims against BP, and requested additional authority from the federal government to address Medicaid fraud.

While Attorney General, McCollum defended Florida&#x27;s ban on adoptions by homosexuals from a lawsuit, &quot;In re: Gill&quot;, that challenged the ban. McCollum hired Dr. George Rekers, a controversial clinical psychologist, to testify during the trial that heterosexual parents provide a better environment for children. The trial resulted in the overturning of the ban. When an appellate court upheld the lower court ruling, McCollum declined to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

McCollum was also the Florida Chairman for the Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign in 2008.

== 2010 gubernatorial candidacy ==
On May 18, 2009, McCollum announced his candidacy for Governor of Florida. The election determined the successor of Charlie Crist who later lost his bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate.
McCollum opposed federal health care mandates in Florida, decrying them as an unconstitutional &quot;tax on living,&quot; and joined with 13 other state attorneys general in filing a federal lawsuit. The majority of Florida voters opposed such a lawsuit according to polling in April 2010. He has advocated a state constitutional amendment that would opt Florida out of Washington mandates on health care, although questions about whether such an amendment would be constitutional have been raised. On September 8, 2009 McCollum said he supported Medicare and Medicaid programs but opposed a government-run &#x27;public option&#x27; for health insurance.

In the Republican primary, McCollum faced businessman Rick Scott, who had never before held elective office. McCollum criticized Scott&#x27;s tenure as CEO of healthcare company Columbia/HCA, during which the company became entangled in a federal Medicare fraud investigation. Scott countered that the FBI had never targeted him personally. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; noted that a 1998 congressional bill sponsored by McCollum would have made it more difficult to prosecute Medicare fraud cases, a fact that undermined McCollum’s criticisms of Scott.

Scott defeated McCollum in the August primary with approximately 46.4% percent of the vote to McCollum&#x27;s 43.4%


==Private sector==
In 2014, McCollum was named to the board of directors of AML Superconductivity &amp; Magnetics, a privately held company that develops magnet-based and superconducting applications, located in Melbourne, Florida.

==Personal life==
McCollum is married to Ingrid Seebohm McCollum. They have three sons: Douglas, Justin, and Andrew.

<text>( geta) are traditional Japanese footwear resembling flip-flops. A kind of sandal, geta have a flat wooden base elevated with up to three (though commonly two) &quot;teeth&quot;, held on the foot with a fabric thong, which keeps the foot raised above the ground.

== History ==

The earliest known pair of geta was excavated in a neolithic archaeological site near Ningbo, Zhejiang, China, dated to the Liangzhu culture (3400–2250 BCE). These geta differed in construction to modern geta, having five or six holes in place of the modern-day three. The use and popularity of wooden clogs in China has been recorded in other sources dating to between the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BCE) to the Qin (221–206 BCE) and Han dynasties (202 BCE–220 CE). Geta-style shoes were worn in Southern China likely until sometime between the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties (1636/1644–1912), when they were replaced by other types of footwear.

It is likely that geta originated from Southern China and were later exported to Japan. Examples of Japanese geta dating back to the latter part of the Heian period (794–1185) were found in Aomori in 2004, during an excavation along the right bank of the Shinjo river.

 – high-ranking courtesans of the feudal period in Japan – wore tall, lacquered -geta or () when walking in a parade with their attendants. Whereas geisha and wore socks, chose not to, even in winter, as the bare foot against a lacquered clog was considered to be erotic, leaving the toes poking out under their expensive and highly decorated padded kimono.

This style of geta was likely worn as a point of visual distinction between , geisha and their apprentice geisha, as though the former entertained the upper classes, the latter did not, and were considered to be lower-class, despite their immense popularity.

Some seafood and fish merchants also used very high geta with particularly long teeth to keep their feet above any scraps of fish on the floor of their shops; these were known as geta.

==Use==
Geta are primarily worn with , but sometimes also with Western clothing during the summer months. As geta are usually worn only with or other informal Japanese clothes or Western clothes, there is no need to wear socks. Ordinarily, people wear slightly more formal zori when wearing .

Geta are worn with the foot overhanging the back and a finger-width of space between the strap and the skin webbing between the toes. The toes pinch the strap to lift the toe of the geta. Wearing them otherwise can make balancing more difficult and blisters more likely.

===In weather===
Sometimes geta are worn in rain to keep the feet dry, due to their extra height and impermeability compared to other footwear such as zori. The inflexibility of geta means that water and dirt are not flipped up onto the back of the legs.

Geta are not normally worn in snow, because snow often gets stuck to the teeth of the geta, making it difficult to walk. However, in historical times, they were worn in the snow.

Geta may come with removable toe covers for use in cold, snow and rain. Some even come with ice skating blades.

==Styles==
There are several different styles of geta. The most familiar style consists of an unfinished wooden board called a that the foot is set upon, with a cloth thong (known as the ) passing between the big toe and second toe.
The supporting blocks below the base boards, called the , are also made of wood, usually very light-weight paulownia wood (known as ). If there are two &quot;teeth&quot;, the forefront one is placed under the ball of the foot, and the geta pivots on it while walking, while the rear one is placed under the standing center of gravity. The teeth make a distinctive &quot;clacking&quot; sound while walking, referred to as . This is sometimes mentioned as one of the sounds that older Japanese people miss most in modern life. A traditional saying in Japanese translates as &quot;You don&#x27;t know until you have worn geta.&quot; This means roughly, &quot;you can&#x27;t tell the results until the game is over.&quot;

The original motivation for wearing the high platform shoes was not fashion, but practicality: to keep feet and kimono from coming in contact with things on the ground, such as dirt, filth, water, or snow.

The may vary in shape, from oval shapes to more rectangular, with the former being considered more feminine and the latter more masculine. Geta also vary in colour from natural wood to lacquered or wood-stained varieties. The may also vary in style; for example, geta have only a single centered &quot;tooth&quot;. There are also less common geta with three teeth.

===Geisha===
 (geisha in training) wear distinctive tall geta called , which are similar to the chopines worn in Venice during the Renaissance. Very young girls also wear (also called and ) that have a small bell inside a cavity in the thick sole. These geta have no teeth, but are formed of one piece of wood. The middle part is carved out from below and the front is sloped to accommodate for walking.

 for young girls are usually red in color and are not worn with , but a very fancy kimono, usually the bright, colourful kimono worn for . are usually worn with socks.

==Construction==
Geta are made of one piece of solid wood forming the sole and two wooden blocks underneath. These blocks may have a metal plate on the section that touches the ground in order to lengthen the life span of the geta. A V-shaped thong of cloth forms the upper part of the sandal.

The teeth are usually not separate, instead, the geta is carved from one block of wood. The tooth is, however, strengthened by a special attachment. The teeth of any geta may have harder wood drilled into the bottom to avoid splitting, and the soles of the teeth may have rubber soles glued onto them.

The can be wide and padded, or narrow and hard, and can be made with many sorts of fabric. Printed cotton with traditional Japanese motifs is popular, but there are also geta with vinyl and leather . Inside the is a cord (synthetic in modern times, but traditionally hemp) that is knotted in a special way to the three holes of the . In the wide there is some padding as well. The are replaceable. It sits between the two first toes because having the thong of rectangular geta anywhere but the middle would result in the inner back corners of the geta colliding when walking.

Recently, as Western shoes have become more popular, more Western-looking geta have been developed. They are more round in shape, may have an ergonomically shaped , a thick heel as in Western clogs, instead of separate teeth, and the thong at the side as in flip-flops. According to Japanese superstition, breaking the thong on one&#x27;s geta is considered very unlucky.

<text>, is a shōjo manga series written by Hisaya Nakajo. The manga was serialized in Japan in Hakusensha&#x27;s semi-monthly shōjo manga magazine, &quot;Hana to Yume&quot;. The series was concluded with the Japanese release of volume 23 in November 2004. It was also adapted into several live-action television dramas. An anime television series adaptation has been announced.

&quot;Hana-Kimi&quot; was published in English by Viz Media with the final volume released in the United States in April 2008.

The series centers on Mizuki Ashiya, a Japanese girl who lives in the United States. One day, she sees a track and field competition on TV, and becomes attracted to one of the high jump competitors, Izumi Sano. She begins to idolize the young athlete and eventually transfers to Japan to attend the same school that Sano attends. Sano attends an all-boys high school named Osaka Gakuen and Mizuki attempts to disguise herself as a boy to enter.

==Plot==
Mizuki Ashiya, a Japanese girl living in the United States, watches a program on TV featuring a high jumper named Izumi Sano. She was amazed by his performance and begins following his athletic career. Years later, she does research on him and discovers that he is currently attending Osaka High School. The school is unfortunately an all-boys school and Mizuki convinces her parents to send her to Japan by herself.

Oblivious to the fact that their daughter is going to attend a boys&#x27; school, her parents let her go. To enter the school, she cuts off her long hair, disguises herself as a male, and tries her best to give hope to Sano after hearing that he no longer does the high jump. As she settles in, an accident reveals her identity to Hokuto Umeda, the school doctor, and Izumi Sano. Izumi hides his knowledge of Mizuki&#x27;s gender and tries to help her keep her secret, though it sure is not easy as many situations land Mizuki in compromising positions that will reveal her true gender.

===Setting===

The three grade levels are divided into three classes. These nine classes are divided into three dormitories, as most of the students do not stay around the school area. The cultures within the individual dormitories are immensely different.

Most students residing in the first dormitory are athletes who were accepted into Osaka High on a sports scholarship. The head of the dormitory is Tennouji. The head of the second dormitory is Minami Nanba. The students in the second dorm are a mix of athletes and scholars who have sports or academic scholarships. The third dormitory consists mainly of artistic and intelligent people and is headed by Masao Himejima. Inter-dorm rivalries are common and become particularly intense during the school&#x27;s cultural festival.

It was later chosen as one of the series for School Library Journal&#x27;s Good Comics for Kids Summer Reading Challenge in 2009.

Maria Lin noted that while she normally disliked female protagonists in manga, she praised Mizuki as an exception, crediting her with lifting the manga above other &quot;pretty boy manga&quot;, enjoying her &quot;never-give-up attitude&quot;. While Lin enjoyed the art style, she found the male characters&#x27; designs at times generic. Sheena McNeil felt that the premise was &quot;shallow&quot;, but upon reading, found herself &quot;caught up in the story&quot;. McNeil praised the art, citing its importance in a story of deception, enjoying the &quot;gorgeous&quot; character designs, but appreciating the departure from strict aesthetics for humour.

Liann Cooper felt that &quot;Hana-Kimi&quot; was one of Viz&#x27;s most important shōjo properties due to its combination of humour, angst and the artwork, but criticised their cover design.

Kat Avila, due to the fourth volume&#x27;s humour and attractive male characters, found she enjoyed &quot;Hana-Kimi&quot; better than &quot;Girl Got Game&quot;.

By the fourth and fifth volume, the author had increased the cast, but Maria Lin felt that the storyline was still coherent despite this.

<text>Tris, or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, or known during medical use as tromethamine or THAM, is an organic compound with the formula (HOCH2)3CNH2. It is extensively used in biochemistry and molecular biology as a component of buffer solutions such as in TAE and TBE buffers, especially for solutions of nucleic acids. It contains a primary amine and thus undergoes the reactions associated with typical amines, e.g., condensations with aldehydes. Tris also complexes with metal ions in solution. In medicine, tromethamine is occasionally used as a drug, given in intensive care for its properties as a buffer for the treatment of severe metabolic acidosis in specific circumstances. Some medications are formulated as the &quot;tromethamine salt&quot; including Hemabate (carboprost as trometamol salt), and &quot;ketorolac trometamol&quot;. In 2023 a strain of &quot;Pseudomonas hunanensis&quot; was found to be able to degrade TRIS buffer.

Since Tris&#x27; pKa is more strongly temperature dependent, its use is not recommended in biochemical applications requiring consistent pH over a range of temperatures. Moreover, the temperature dependance of the pKa (and in turn buffer solution pH) makes pH adjustment difficult. (E.g., the &#x27;room temperature&#x27; pH adjustment would not translate to &#x27;measurement conditions&#x27; pH, unless care is taken to calculate the effect of temperature, see below.)

==Buffering features==
The conjugate acid of tris has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 8.07 at 25 °C, which implies that the buffer has an effective pH range between 7.1 and 9.1 (p&quot;K&quot;a ± 1) at room temperature.

===Buffer details===
*In general, as temperature decreases from 25 °C to 5 °C the pH of a tris buffer will increase an average of 0.03 units per degree. As temperature rises from 25 °C to 37 °C, the pH of a tris buffer will decrease an average of 0.025 units per degree.
*In general, a 10-fold increase in tris buffer concentration will lead to a 0.05 unit increase in pH and vice versa.
*Silver-containing single-junction pH electrodes (e.g., silver chloride electrodes) are incompatible with tris since an Ag-tris precipitate forms which clogs the junction. Double-junction electrodes are resistant to this problem, and non-silver containing electrodes are immune.

===Buffer inhibition===
*Tris inhibits a number of enzymes, and therefore should be used with care when studying proteins.
*Tris can also inhibit enzyme activity via chelation of metal ions.

==Preparation==
Tris is prepared industrially by the exhaustive condensation of nitromethane with formaldehyde under basic conditions (i.e. repeated Henry reactions) to produce the intermediate (HOCH2)3CNO2, which is subsequently hydrogenated to give the final product.

==Uses==
The useful buffer range for tris (pH 7–9) coincides with the physiological pH typical of most living organisms. This, and its low cost, make tris one of the most common buffers in the biology/biochemistry laboratory. Tris is also used as a primary standard to standardize acid solutions for chemical analysis.

Tris is used to increase permeability of cell membranes. It is a component of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use in children 5 through 11 years of age.

===Medical===
Tris (usually known as THAM in this context) is used as alternative to sodium bicarbonate in the treatment of metabolic acidosis.

<doc id="496253" wikidata="Q51666" url="?curid=496253" title="Historical Jesus">
<text>The term &quot;historical Jesus&quot; refers to the life and teachings of Jesus as interpreted through critical historical methods, in contrast to what are traditionally religious interpretations. It also considers the historical and cultural contexts in which Jesus lived.
Virtually all scholars of antiquity accept that Jesus was a historical figure, and the idea that Jesus was a mythical figure has been consistently rejected by the scholarly consensus as a fringe theory. Scholars differ about the beliefs and teachings of Jesus as well as the accuracy of the biblical accounts, with only two events being supported by nearly universal scholarly consensus: Jesus was baptized and Jesus was crucified.

Reconstructions of the historical Jesus are based on the Pauline epistles and the gospels, while several non-biblical sources also support his historical existence. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and developing new and different research criteria. Historical Jesus scholars typically contend that he was a Galilean Jew and living in a time of messianic and apocalyptic expectations. Some scholars credit the apocalyptic declarations of the gospels to him, while others portray his &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; as a moral one, and not apocalyptic in nature.

The portraits of Jesus that have been constructed through history using these processes have often differed from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts. Such portraits include that of Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet, charismatic healer, Cynic philosopher, Jewish messiah, prophet of social change, and rabbi. There is little scholarly agreement on a single portrait, nor the methods needed to construct it, but there are overlapping attributes among the various portraits, and scholars who differ on some attributes may agree on others.

==Historical existence==
Virtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed. Historian Michael Grant asserts that if conventional standards of historical criticism are applied to the New Testament, &quot;we can no more reject Jesus&#x27; existence than we can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned.&quot; There is no indication that writers in antiquity who opposed Christianity questioned the existence of Jesus.

Since the 1970s, various scholars such as Joachim Jeremias, E. P. Sanders and Gerd Theissen have traced elements of Christianity to currents in first-century Judaism and have discarded nineteenth-century minority views that Jesus was based on previous pagan deities. Mentions of Jesus in extra-biblical texts exist and are supported as genuine by the majority of historians. Differences between the content of the Jewish Messianic prophecies and the life of Jesus undermine the idea that Jesus was invented as a Jewish Midrash or Peshar. The presence of details of Jesus&#x27; life in Paul, and the differences between letters and Gospels, are sufficient for most scholars to dismiss mythicist claims concerning Paul. Theissen says &quot;there is broad scholarly consensus that we can best find access to the historical Jesus through the Synoptic tradition.&quot; Bart D. Ehrman adds: &quot;To dismiss the Gospels from the historical record is neither fair nor scholarly.&quot; One book argues that if Jesus did not exist, &quot;the origin of the faith of the early Christians remains a perplexing mystery.&quot; Eddy and Boyd say the best history can assert is probability, yet the probability of Jesus having existed is so high, Ehrman says &quot;virtually all historians and scholars have concluded Jesus did exist as a historical figure.&quot; Historian James Dunn writes: &quot;Today nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed&quot;. In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, Ehrman wrote: &quot;He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees.&quot;

The Christ myth theory is the proposition that Jesus of Nazareth never existed, or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. In the 21st century, there have been a number of books and documentaries on this subject. For example, Earl Doherty has written that Jesus may have been a real person, but that the biblical accounts of him are almost entirely fictional. Many proponents use a three-fold argument first developed in the 19th century: that the New Testament has no historical value with respect to Jesus&#x27;s existence, that there are no non-Christian references to Jesus from the first century, and that Christianity had pagan and/or mythical roots.

Contemporary scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, and biblical scholars and classical historians view the theories of his nonexistence as effectively refuted. Robert M. Price, an atheist who denies the existence of Jesus, agrees that his perspective runs against the views of the majority of scholars. Michael Grant (a classicist and historian) states that &quot;In recent years, no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non-historicity of Jesus, or at any rate very few have, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary.&quot; Richard A. Burridge states, &quot;There are those who argue that Jesus is a figment of the Church&#x27;s imagination, that there never was a Jesus at all. I have to say that I do not know any respectable critical scholar who says that anymore.&quot;

==Sources==
The New Testament represents sources that have become canonical for Christianity, and there are many apocryphal texts that are examples of the wide variety of writings in the first centuries AD that are related to Jesus.

Non-Christian sources that are used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus include Jewish sources such as Josephus, and Roman sources such as Tacitus.

===New Testament sources===

====Pauline epistles====

The Pauline epistles are dated to between AD 50 and 60 (&quot;i.e.&quot;, approximately twenty to thirty years after the generally accepted time period for the death of Jesus), and are the earliest surviving Christian texts that include information about Jesus.

Although Paul the Apostle provides little biographical information about Jesus compared to the Gospels, he was a contemporary of Jesus and does make it clear that he considers Jesus to have been a real person and a Jew. Moreover, he claims to have met with James, the brother of Jesus. Paul states that he personally knew and interacted with eyewitnesses of Jesus such as his most intimate disciples (Peter and John) and family members (his brother James) starting around 35 or 36 AD, within just a few years after the crucifixion, and got some direct information about his life from them. From Paul&#x27;s writings alone, a fairly full outline of the life of Jesus can be found: his descent from Abraham and David, his upbringing in the Jewish Law, gathering together disciples, including Cephas (Peter) and John, having a brother named James, living an exemplary life, the Last Supper and betrayal, numerous details surrounding his death and resurrection (e.g. crucifixion, Jewish involvement in putting him to death, burial, resurrection, seen by Peter, James, the twelve and others) along with numerous quotations referring to notable teachings and events found in the Gospels.

====Synoptic Gospels and Acts====
The Synoptic Gospels are the primary sources of historical information about Jesus and of the religious movement he founded. These religious gospelsthe Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Mark, and the Gospel of Lukerecount the incarnation, life, ministry, crucifixion and resurrection of a Jew named Jesus who spoke Aramaic and wore tzitzit. There are different hypotheses regarding the origin of the texts because the gospels of the New Testament were written in Greek for Greek-speaking communities, and were later translated into Syriac, Latin, and Coptic.

Historians often study the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles when studying the reliability of the gospels, as the Book of Acts was seemingly written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke.

====The Gospel of John====

The fourth gospel, the Gospel of John, differs greatly from the Synoptic Gospels and scholars generally consider it to be less useful for reconstructions of the life of Jesus than the Synoptic Gospels. As James Crossley and Robert J. Myles explain, John &quot;is of limited use for reconstructing the life of the historical Jesus.&quot; However, since the third quest, John&#x27;s gospel is seen as having more reliability than previously thought or is sometimes seen as even more reliable than the synoptics. For example, certain sayings in John are as old as or older than their synoptic counterparts, his representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior to that of the synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.

===Non-biblical sources===
In addition to biblical sources, there are a number of mentions of Jesus in non-Christian sources.

====Thallos====
Biblical scholar Frederick Fyvie Bruce says the earliest mention of Jesus outside the New Testament occurs from a historian named Thallos. Thallos&#x27; history, like the vast majority of ancient literature, has been lost but not before it was quoted by Sextus Julius Africanus (), a Christian writer, in his &quot;History of the World&quot; (). This book likewise was lost, but not before one of its citations of Thallos was taken up by the Byzantine historian George Syncellus in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; (). There is no means by which certainty can be established concerning this or any of the other lost references, partial references, and questionable references that mention some aspect of Jesus&#x27; life or death, but in evaluating evidence, it is appropriate to note they exist.

====Josephus and Tacitus====
There are two passages in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus, and one from the Roman historian Tacitus, that are generally considered good evidence.

Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, written around AD 93–94, includes two references to the biblical Jesus in Books and . The general scholarly view is that while the longer passage, known as the &quot;Testimonium Flavianum&quot;, is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus, which was then subject to Christian interpolation. Of the other mention in Josephus, Josephus scholar Louis H. Feldman has stated that &quot;few have doubted the genuineness&quot; of Josephus&#x27; reference to Jesus in (&quot;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James&quot;). Paul references meeting and interacting with James, Jesus&#x27; brother, and since this agreement between the different sources supports Josephus&#x27; statement, the statement is only disputed by a small number of scholars.

Roman historian Tacitus referred to &quot;Christus&quot; and his execution by Pontius Pilate in his &quot;Annals&quot; (written c. AD 116), . Robert E. Van Voorst states that the very negative tone of Tacitus&#x27; comments on Christians makes the passage extremely unlikely to have been forged by a Christian scribe and the Tacitus reference is now widely accepted as an independent confirmation of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion.

====Talmud====

Other considerations outside Christendom include the possible mentions of Jesus in the Talmud. The Talmud speaks in some detail of the conduct of criminal cases of Israel whose texts were gathered together from 200 to 500 CE. Johann Maier and Bart D. Ehrman argue this material is too late to be of much use. Ehrman explains that &quot;Jesus is never mentioned in the oldest part of the Talmud, the Mishnah, but appears only in the later commentaries of the Gemara.&quot; Jesus is not mentioned by name, but there is a subtle attack on the virgin birth that refers to the illegitimate son of a Roman soldier Pantera (Ehrman says, &quot;In Greek the word for virgin is &quot;parthenos&quot;&quot;), and a reference to Jesus&#x27; miracles as &quot;black magic&quot; learned when he lived in Egypt (as a toddler). Ehrman writes that few contemporary scholars treat this as historical.

====Mara bar Serapion====
There is only one classical writer who refers positively to Jesus and that is Mara bar Serapion, a Syriac Stoic, who wrote a letter to his son, who was also named Serapion, from a Roman prison. He speaks of the execution of &#x27;the wise king of the Jews&#x27; and compares his death to that of Socrates at the hands of the Athenians. He links the death of the &#x27;wise king&#x27; to the Jews being driven from their kingdom. He also states that the &#x27;wise king&#x27; lives on because of the &quot;new laws he laid down&quot;. The dating of the letter is disputed but was probably soon after 73 AD.

Scholars such as Robert Van Voorst see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the &quot;king of the Jews&quot; is about the death of Jesus. Others such as Craig A. Evans see less value in the letter, given its uncertain date, and the ambiguity in the reference.

==Critical-historical research==
Historical criticism, also known as the historical-critical method or higher criticism, is a branch of criticism that investigates the origins of ancient texts in order to understand &quot;the world behind the text&quot;. The primary goal of historical criticism is to discover the text&#x27;s primitive or original meaning in its original historical context and its literal sense. Historical criticism began in the 17th century and gained popular recognition in the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Historical reliability of the Gospels===
The historical reliability of the gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Historical reliability is not dependent on a source being inerrant or void of agendas since there are sources that are considered generally reliable despite having such traits (e.g. Josephus). The question of reliability is a matter of ongoing debate.

Historians subject the gospels to critical analysis by differentiating authentic, reliable information from possible inventions, exaggerations, and alterations. Since there are more textual variants (200,000–400,000) than words in the New Testament, scholars use textual criticism to determine which gospel variants could theoretically be taken as original. To answer this question, scholars have to ask who wrote the gospels, when they wrote them, what was their objective in writing them, what sources the authors used, how reliable these sources were, and how far removed in time the sources were from the stories they narrate, or if they were altered later. Scholars may also look into the internal evidence of the documents, to see if, for example, a document has misquoted texts from the Hebrew Tanakh, has made incorrect claims about geography, if the author appears to have hidden information, or if the author has fabricated a prophecy. Finally, scholars turn to external sources, including the testimony of early church leaders, to writers outside the church, primarily Jewish and Greco-Roman historians, who would have been more likely to have criticized the church, and to archaeological evidence.

===Quest for the historical Jesus===

Conventionally since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus are distinguished, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from pre-Enlightenment approaches because they rely on the historical-critical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques in the attempt to establish the historical validity of their conclusions.

According to Tucker Ferda, it is by now &quot;conventional wisdom that the traditional threefold division of the quest for Jesus [...] is flawed&quot;. The threefold terminology uses the literature selectively, poses an incorrect periodization of research, and fails to note that the quest did not begin with Reimarus, as Albert Schweitzer had claimed, but started earlier, with critical questions regarding the Christian origins narrative.

====First quest====
The scholarly effort to reconstruct an &quot;authentic&quot; historical picture of Jesus was a product of the Enlightenment skepticism of the late eighteenth century. Bible scholar Gerd Theissen explains that &quot;It was concerned with presenting a historically true life of Jesus that functioned theologically as a critical force over against [established Roman Catholic] Christology.&quot; The first scholar to separate the historical Jesus from the theological Jesus in this way was philosopher, writer, classicist, Hebraist and Enlightenment free thinker Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694–1768). Copies of Reimarus&#x27; writings were discovered by G. E. Lessing (1729–1781) in the library at Wolfenbüttel where Lessing was the librarian. Reimarus had left permission for his work to be published after his death, and Lessing did so between 1774 and 1778, publishing them as &quot;Die Fragmente eines unbekannten Autors&quot; (&quot;The Fragments of an Unknown Author&quot;). Over time, they came to be known as the &quot;Wolfenbüttel Fragments&quot; after the library where Lessing worked. Reimarus distinguished between what Jesus taught and how he is portrayed in the New Testament. According to Reimarus, Jesus was a political messiah who failed at creating political change and was executed. His disciples then stole the body and invented the story of the resurrection for personal gain. Reimarus&#x27; controversial work prompted a response from &quot;the father of historical critical research&quot; Johann Semler in 1779, &quot;Beantwortung der Fragmente eines Ungenannten&quot; (&quot;Answering the Fragments of an Unknown&quot;). Semler refuted Reimarus&#x27; arguments, but it was of little consequence. Reimarus&#x27; writings had already made lasting changes by making it clear criticism could exist independently of theology and faith, and by founding historical Jesus studies within that non-sectarian view.

According to Homer W. Smith, the work of Lessing and others culminated in the Protestant theologian David Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Das Leben Jesu&quot; (&#x27;The Life of Jesus&#x27;, 1835), in which Strauss expresses his conclusion that Jesus existed, but that his godship is the result of &quot;a historic nucleus [being] worked over and reshaped into an ideal form by the first Christians under the influence of Old Testament models and the idea of the messiah found in Daniel.&quot; 
The enthusiasm shown during the first quest diminished after Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s critique of 1906 in which he pointed out various shortcomings in the approaches used at the time. After Schweitzer&#x27;s &quot;Von Reimarus zu Wrede&quot; was translated and published in English as &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus&quot; in 1910, the book&#x27;s title provided the label for the field of study for eighty years.

====Second quest====
The second quest began in 1953 and introduced a number of new techniques, but faded away in the 1970s.

====Third quest====
In the 1980s a number of scholars gradually began to introduce new research ideas, initiating a third quest characterized by the latest research approaches. One of the modern aspects of the third quest has been the role of archaeology; James Charlesworth states that modern scholars now want to use archaeological discoveries that clarify the nature of life in Galilee and Judea during the time of Jesus. A further characteristic of the third quest has been the interdisciplinary and global nature of its scholarship. While the first two quests were mostly carried out by European Protestant theologians, a modern aspect of the third quest is the worldwide influx of scholars from multiple disciplines. More recently, historicists have focused their attention on the historical writings associated with the era in which Jesus lived or on the evidence concerning his family.

By the end of the twentieth century, scholar Tom Holmén writes that Enlightenment skepticism had given way to a more &quot;trustful attitude toward the historical reliability of the sources ... [Currently] the conviction of Sanders, (we know quite a lot about Jesus) characterizes the majority of contemporary studies.&quot; Reflecting this shift, the phrase &quot;quest for the historical Jesus&quot; has largely been replaced by &quot;life of Jesus research.&quot;

====Demise of authenticity and the &quot;Next Quest&quot;====
Since the late 1900s, concerns have been growing about the usefulness of the criteria of authenticity. According to Le Donne, the usage of such criteria is a form of &quot;positivist historiography&quot;. According to James DG Dunn, &quot;What we actually have in the earliest retellings of what is now the Synoptic tradition...are the memories of the first disciples-not Jesus himself, but the remembered Jesus. The idea that we can get back to an objective historical reality, which we can wholly separate and disentangle from the disciples&#x27; memories...is simply unrealistic.&quot; According to Chris Keith, a historical Jesus is &quot;ultimately unattainable, but can be hypothesized on the basis of the interpretations of the early Christians, and as part of a larger process of accounting for how and why early Christians came to view Jesus in the ways that they did.&quot; According to Keith, &quot;these two models are methodologically and epistemologically incompatible,&quot; calling into question the methods and aim of the first model.

In 2021, James Crossley (editor of the &quot;Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus&quot;) announced that historical Jesus scholarship now had moved to the era of the Next Quest. The Next Quest has moved on from the criteria, obsessions with the uniqueness of Jesus, and the supersessionism still implicit in scholarly questions of the Jewishness of Jesus. Instead, sober scholarship now focuses on treating the subject matter as part of the wider human phenomenon of religion, cultural comparison, class relations, slave culture and economy, and the social history of historical Jesus scholarship and wider reception histories of the historical Jesus. The book by Crossley and Robert J. Myles, &quot;Jesus: A Life in Class Conflict&quot;, is indicative of this new tendency.

Others have criticized claims of a Fourth Quest and had a more measured response to critique of the criteria. The actual problem is arguably that critics use them inappropriately, trying to describe the history of minute portions of the Gospel text, rather than a true flaw in the historical logic of the criteria. According to Tucker Ferda, &quot;...criticisms of the criteria have sometimes produced rather grandiose claims about their &quot;uselessness,&quot; which do not seem justified when one looks at the kind of argument that those same critics will use when making positive claims about the historical Jesus...criticisms of the notion of &quot;authenticity&quot; or &quot;historicity&quot; can create the impression that there is more disagreement with earlier research than is actually the case.&quot;

==Methods==
===Textual, source and form-criticism===
The first quest, which started in 1778, was almost entirely based on biblical criticism. This took the form of textual and source criticism originally, which were supplemented with form criticism in 1919, and redaction criticism in 1948. Form criticism began as an attempt to trace the history of the biblical material during the oral period before it was written in its current form, and may be seen as starting where textual criticism ends. Form criticism views Gospel writers as editors, not authors. Redaction criticism may be viewed as the child of source criticism and form criticism. and views the Gospel writers as authors and early theologians and tries to understand how the redactor(s) has (have) molded the narrative to express their own perspectives.

===Criteria of authenticity===
When form criticism questioned the historical reliability of the Gospels, scholars began looking for other criteria. Taken from other areas of study such as source criticism, the &quot;criteria of authenticity&quot; emerged gradually, becoming a distinct branch of methodology associated with life of Jesus research. The &quot;criteria&quot; are a variety of rules used to determine if some event or person is more or less likely to be historical. These criteria are primarily, though not exclusively, used to assess the sayings and actions of Jesus.

In view of the skepticism produced in the mid-twentieth century by form criticism concerning the historical reliability of the gospels, the burden shifted in historical Jesus studies from attempting to identify an authentic life of Jesus to attempting to prove authenticity. The criteria developed within this framework, therefore, are tools that provide arguments solely for authenticity, not inauthenticity. In 1901, the application of criteria of authenticity began with dissimilarity. It was often applied unevenly with a preconceived goal. In the early decades of the twentieth century, F. C. Burkitt and B. H. Streeter provided the foundation for multiple attestation. The Second Quest introduced the criterion of embarrassment. By the 1950s, coherence was also included. By 1987, D. Polkow lists 25 separate criteria being used by scholars to test for historical authenticity including the criterion of &quot;historical plausibility&quot;.

===Criticism===
A number of scholars have criticized the various approaches used in the study of the historical Jesus—on one hand, for the lack of rigor in research methods; on the other, for being driven by &quot;specific agendas&quot; that interpret ancient sources to fit specific goals. By the 21st century, the &quot;maximalist&quot; approaches of the 19th century, which accepted all the gospels, and the &quot;minimalist&quot; trends of the early 20th century, which totally rejected them, were abandoned and scholars began to focus on what is historically probable and plausible about Jesus.

==Baptism and crucifixion==

There is widespread disagreement among scholars on the details of the life of Jesus mentioned in the gospel narratives, and on the meaning of his teachings. Scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the biblical accounts of Jesus, but almost all modern scholars consider his baptism and crucifixion to be historical facts.

===Baptism===

The existence of John the Baptist within the same time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century Roman-Jewish historian Josephus and the overwhelming majority of modern scholars view Josephus&#x27; accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent, as it implies that Jesus was subservient to John. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.

===Crucifixion===

John P. Meier views the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical fact and states that based on the criterion of embarrassment, Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader. Meier states that a number of other criteriathe criterion of &quot;multiple attestation&quot; (i.e., confirmation by more than one source), the &quot;criterion of coherence&quot; (i.e., that it fits with other historical elements) and the &quot;criterion of rejection&quot; (i.e., that it is not disputed by ancient sources)help establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event. Eddy and Boyd state that it is now firmly established that there is non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesusreferring to the mentions in Josephus and Tacitus.

Most scholars in the third quest for the historical Jesus consider the crucifixion indisputable, as do Bart Ehrman, John Dominic Crossan and James Dunn. Although scholars agree on the historicity of the crucifixion, they differ on the reason and context for it, e.g. both E. P. Sanders and Paula Fredriksen support the historicity of the crucifixion, but contend that Jesus did not foretell his own crucifixion, and that his prediction of the crucifixion is a Christian story. Géza Vermes also views the crucifixion as a historical event but believes this was due to Jesus’ challenging of Roman authority. On the other hand, Maurice Casey and John P. Meier state that Jesus did predict his death, and this actually strengthened his followers&#x27; belief in his Resurrection. Mara bar Serapion is the only source from the ancient world that mentions the execution of Jesus for the charge of &quot;King of the Jews&quot;. Bart Ehrman states that Jesus portrayed himself as the leader of the future Kingdom and that a number of criteria – the criterion of multiple attestation and criterion of dissimilarity – establishes the crucifixion of Jesus as an enemy of state.

===Possibly historical elements===
In addition to the two historical elements of baptism and crucifixion, scholars attribute varying levels of certainty to various other aspects of the life of Jesus, although there is no universal agreement among scholars on these items:
* Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was born between 7 and 2 BC and died 30–36 AD.
* Jesus lived only in Galilee and Judea: Most scholars reject that there is any evidence that an adult Jesus traveled or studied outside Galilee and Judea. Marcus Borg states that the suggestions that an adult Jesus traveled to Egypt or India are &quot;without historical foundation&quot;. John Dominic Crossan states that none of the theories presented to fill the gap of 15–18 years between Jesus&#x27;s early life and the start of his ministry have been supported by modern scholarship. The Talmud refers to &quot;Jesus the Nazarene&quot; several times and scholars such as Andreas Kostenberger and Robert Van Voorst hold that some of these references are to Jesus. Nazareth is not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian gospels portray it as an insignificant village, asking &quot;Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?&quot; Craig S. Keener states that it is rarely disputed that Jesus was from Nazareth, an obscure small village not worthy of invention. Gerd Theissen concurs with that conclusion.
* Jesus spoke Aramaic, and may have also spoken Hebrew and Greek. The languages spoken in Galilee and Judea during the 1st century include the Semitic Aramaic and Hebrew languages as well as Greek, with Aramaic being the predominant language.
* Jesus called disciples: John P. Meier sees the calling of disciples a natural consequence of the information available about Jesus. N. T. Wright accepts that there were twelve disciples, but holds that the list of their names cannot be determined with certainty. John Dominic Crossan disagrees, stating that Jesus did not call disciples and had an &quot;open to all&quot; egalitarian approach, imposed no hierarchy and preached to all in equal terms. However, James Crossley and Robert J. Myles and the emerging consensus disagree with Crossan, arguing that &quot;we should dispel romantic notions that this movement was proudly egalitarian and progressive in the sense of the &#x27;radical liberalism&#x27; of today&quot; and instead point out that the core Twelve may have been &quot;a central committee or politburo with membership sometimes changing.&quot; 
* Jesus caused a controversy at the Temple.
* After his death his disciples continued, and some of his disciples were persecuted.
* Jesus had a burial.

Some scholars have proposed further additional historical possibilities such as:
* An approximate chronology of Jesus can be estimated from non-Christian sources, and confirmed by correlating them with New Testament accounts.
* Claims about the appearance or ethnicity of Jesus are mostly subjective, based on cultural stereotypes and societal trends rather than on scientific analysis.
* The baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist can be dated approximately from Josephus&#x27; references () to a date before AD 28–35.
* The main topic of his teaching was the Kingdom of God, and he presented this teaching in parables that were surprising and sometimes confounding.
* Jesus taught an ethic of forgiveness, as expressed in aphorisms such as &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; or &quot;go the extra mile&quot;. Within the traditional ethic of &quot;Christian forgiveness&quot; there are differing views regarding the nature of forgiveness as taught by Jesus.
* The date of the crucifixion of Jesus was earlier than 36 AD, based on the dates of the prefecture of Pontius Pilate who was governor of Roman Judea from 26 AD until 36 AD.

==Portraits of the historical Jesus==

Scholars involved in the third and next quests for the historical Jesus have constructed a variety of portraits and profiles for Jesus. However, there is little scholarly agreement on the portraits, or the methods used in constructing them. The portraits of Jesus that have been constructed in the quest for the historical Jesus have often differed from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts. These portraits include that of Jesus as an &quot;apocalyptic prophet&quot;, &quot;charismatic healer&quot;, &quot;Cynic philosopher&quot;, &quot;Jewish Messiah&quot; and &quot;prophet of social change&quot;, but there is little scholarly agreement on a single portrait, or the methods needed to construct it. There are, however, overlapping attributes among the various portraits, and scholars who differ on some attributes may agree on others. The conception of a &quot;Historical Jesus&quot; is limited to the abductions from modern scholars on the sources and the results can only produce fragments of what the &quot;real Jesus&quot; or &quot;Jesus of history&quot; may have been. Such conceptions are merely a sketch or model which may inform about but never will be the real Jesus of history; similar to how models exist in the natural sciences that inform about phenomena without specifying a particular object. W.R. Herzog has stated that: &quot;What we call the historical Jesus is the composite of the recoverable bits and pieces of historical information and speculation about him that we assemble, construct, and reconstruct. For this reason, the historical Jesus is, in Meier&#x27;s words, &#x27;a modern abstraction and construct.&#x27;&quot;

Contemporary scholarship, representing the &quot;third quest&quot; and the &quot;next quest&quot; places Jesus firmly in the Jewish tradition. Jesus was a Jewish preacher who taught that he was the path to salvation, everlasting life, and the Kingdom of God. A primary criterion used to discern historical details in the &quot;third quest&quot; is that of plausibility, relative to Jesus&#x27; Jewish context and to his influence on Christianity. Contemporary scholars of the &quot;third quest&quot; include E. P. Sanders, Géza Vermes, Gerd Theissen, Christoph Burchard, and John Dominic Crossan. In contrast to the Schweitzerian view, certain North American scholars, such as Burton Mack, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a Cynic sage than an apocalyptic preacher.

Given that Jesus was poor, long-established historiographical approaches associated with the study of the poor in the past, such as microhistory, are relevant to the study of his life.

===Mainstream views===

Despite the significant differences among scholars on what constitutes a suitable portrait for Jesus, the mainstream views supported by a number of scholars may be grouped together based on certain distinct, primary themes. These portraits often include overlapping elements, and there are also differences among the followers of each portrait. The subsections below present the main portraits that are supported by multiple mainstream scholars.

====Apocalyptic prophet====

The apocalyptic prophet view primarily emphasizes Jesus preparing his fellow Jews for the End Times. The first proponent of this hypothesis was Albert Schweitzer in his 1906 book &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus&quot;.

The works of E. P. Sanders and Maurice Casey place Jesus within the context of Jewish eschatological tradition. Bart D. Ehrman aligns himself with Schweitzer&#x27;s view that Jesus expected an apocalypse during his own generation, and he bases some of his views on the argument that the earliest gospel sources (for which he assumes Markan priority) and the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, chapters 4 and 5, probably written by the end of AD 52, present Jesus as far more apocalyptic than other Christian sources produced towards the end of the 1st century, contending that the apocalyptic messages were progressively toned down.

Dale C. Allison Jr. does not see Jesus as advocating specific timetables for the End Times, but sees him as preaching his own doctrine of &quot;apocalyptic eschatology&quot; derived from post-exilitic Jewish teachings, and views the apocalyptic teachings of Jesus as a form of asceticism. Other scholars follow most themes of the apocalyptic portrait, but take such teachings of Jesus as relating to the destruction of the Second Temple and not the end of the world due to the wider significance of the Temple in Judaism that would warrant apocalyptic language.

The characterization of Jesus as an apocalyptic or millenarian prophet can also be combined with other categories, such as in the work of James Crossley and Robert J. Myles (see below) who regard the end-time teaching of Jesus as a culturally credible way of responding to social and material upheaval in Galilee and Judea.

====Charismatic healer====

The charismatic healer portrait positions Jesus as a pious and holy man in the view of Géza Vermes, whose profile draws on the Talmudic representations of Jewish figures such as Hanina ben Dosa and Honi the Circle Drawer and presents Jesus as a Hasid. Marcus Borg views Jesus as a charismatic &quot;man of the spirit&quot;, a mystic or visionary who acts as a conduit for the &quot;Spirit of God&quot;. Borg sees this as a well-defined religious personality type, whose actions often involve healing. Borg sees Jesus as a non-eschatological figure who did not intend to start a new religion, but his message set him at odds with the Jewish powers of his time based on the &quot;politics of holiness&quot;. Both Sanders and Casey agree that Jesus was also a charismatic healer in addition to an apocalyptic prophet.

====Cynic philosopher====
In the Cynic philosopher profile, Jesus is presented as a Cynic, a traveling sage and philosopher preaching a cynical and radical message of change to abolish the existing hierarchical structure of the society of his time. In John Dominic Crossan&#x27;s view Jesus was crucified not for religious reasons but because his social teachings challenged the seat of power held by the Jewish authorities. Crossan believes Galilee was a place where Greek and Jewish culture heavily interacted, with Gadara, a day&#x27;s walk from Nazareth, being a center of Cynic philosophy. Burton Mack also holds that Jesus was a Cynic whose teachings were so different from those of his time that they shocked the audience and forced them to think, but Mack views his death as accidental and not due to his challenge to Jewish authority.

====Jewish Messiah====

The Jewish Messiah portrait of N. T. Wright places Jesus within the Jewish context of &quot;exile and return&quot;, a notion he uses to build on his view of the 1st-century concept of hope. Wright believes that Jesus was the Messiah and argues that the Resurrection of Jesus was a physical and historical event. Wright&#x27;s portrait of Jesus is closer to the traditional Christian views than many other scholars, and when he departs from the Christian tradition, his views are still close to them. Like Wright, Markus Bockmuehl, Peter Stuhlmacher and Brant J. Pitre support the view that Jesus came to announce the end of the Jewish &quot;spiritual exile&quot; and usher in a new messianic era in which God would improve this world through the faith of his people.

====Prophet of social change====
The prophet of social change portrait positions Jesus primarily as someone who challenged the traditional social structures of his time. Gerd Theissen sees three main elements to the activities of Jesus as he effected social change: his positioning as the Son of man, the core group of disciples that followed him, and his localized supporters as he journeyed through Galilee and Judea. Richard A. Horsley goes further and presents Jesus as a more radical reformer who initiated a grassroots movement. David Kaylor&#x27;s ideas are close to those of Horsley, but have a more religious focus and base the actions of Jesus on covenant theology and his desire for justice. Elisabeth Fiorenza has presented a feminist perspective which sees Jesus as a social reformer whose actions such as the acceptance of women followers resulted in the liberation of some women of his time. James Crossley and Robert J. Myles advocate a nuanced historical materialist perspective of Jesus as a religious organizer who responded to the intersecting material conditions of Galilee and Judea in culturally credible ways such as through intra-Jewish legal debate and a revolutionary millenarian proclamation.

S. G. F. Brandon, Fernando Bermejo Rubio, and Reza Aslan argue that Jesus was an anti-Roman revolutionary that tried to overthrow Roman rule in Palestine and re-establish the Kingdom of Israel.

====Rabbi====
The rabbi portrait advances the idea that Jesus was simply a rabbi who sought to reform certain ideas within Judaism. This idea can be traced to the late nineteenth century, when various liberal Jews sought to emphasize the Jewish nature of Jesus, and saw him as something of a proto-Reform Jew. Perhaps the most prominent of these was Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, who in &quot;The Doctrine of Jesus&quot; wrote:

Bruce Chilton, in his book &quot;Rabbi Jesus: An Intimate Biography&quot;, painted Jesus as a devout student of John the Baptist who came to see it as his mission to restore the Temple to purity, and purge the Romans and the corrupt priests from its midst. Jaroslav Pelikan, in &quot;The Illustrated Jesus Through the Centuries&quot; stated:

The most neutral and least controversial of these words is probably Rabbi, along with the related Rabbouni. Except for two passages, the Gospels apply the Aramaic word only to Jesus; and if we conclude that the title &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;master&quot; (didaskalos in Greek) was intended as a translation of that Aramaic name, it seems safe to say that it was as Rabbi that Jesus was known and addressed.

The conservative evangelical scholar Andreas J. Köstenberger in &quot;Jesus as Rabbi in the Fourth Gospel&quot; also reached the conclusion that Jesus was seen by his contemporaries as a rabbi.

In 2012, the book &quot;Kosher Jesus&quot; by Orthodox Rabbi Shmuley Boteach was published in which Boteach takes the position that Jesus was a wise and learned Torah-observant Jewish rabbi. Boteach says he was a beloved member of the Jewish community. At the same time, Jesus is said to have despised the Romans for their cruelty, and to have fought them courageously. The book states that the Jews had nothing whatsoever to do with the murder of Jesus, but rather that the blame for his trial and killing lies with the Romans and Pontius Pilate. Boteach states clearly that he does not believe in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah. At the same time, Boteach argues that &quot;Jews have much to learn from Jesusand from Christianity as a wholewithout accepting Jesus&#x27; divinity. There are many reasons for accepting Jesus as a man of great wisdom, beautiful ethical teachings, and profound Jewish patriotism.&quot; He concludes by writing, as to Judeo-Christian values, that &quot;the hyphen between Jewish and Christian values is Jesus himself.&quot;

===Non-mainstream views===
Other portraits have been presented by individual scholars:
* Ben Witherington supports the &quot;Wisdom Sage&quot; view and states that Jesus is best understood as a teacher of wisdom who saw himself as the embodiment or incarnation of God&#x27;s Wisdom.
*John P. Meier&#x27;s portrait of Jesus as the Marginal Jew is built on the view that Jesus knowingly marginalized himself in a number of ways, first by abandoning his profession as a carpenter and becoming a preacher with no means of support, then arguing against the teachings and traditions of the time while he had no formal rabbinic training.

*Robert Eisenman proposed that James the Just was the Teacher of Righteousness mentioned in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and that the image of Jesus of the gospels was constructed by the Apostle Paul as pro-Roman propaganda.
*Hyam Maccoby proposed that Jesus was a Pharisee, that the positions ascribed to the Pharisees in the Gospels are very different from what we know of them, and in fact their opinions were very similar to those ascribed to Jesus. Harvey Falk also sees Jesus as proto-Pharisee or Essene.
*Morton Smith views Jesus as a magician, a view based on the presentation of Jesus in later Jewish sources and on (dubious) apocryphal writings such as the Secret Gospel of Mark.
*Leo Tolstoy saw Jesus as championing Christian anarchism (although Tolstoy never actually used the term &quot;Christian anarchism&quot;; reviews of his book following its publication in 1894 coined the term.)
*It has been suggested by psychiatrists Oskar Panizza, George de Loosten, William Hirsch, William Sargant, Anthony Storr, Raj Persaud, psychologist Charles Binet-Sanglé and others that Jesus had a mental disorder or psychiatric condition. This theory is based on the fact that the Gospel of Mark (Mark 3:21) reports that &quot;When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said, ″He is out of his mind.″&quot; Psychologist Władysław Witwicki states that Jesus had difficulties communicating with the outside world and suffered from dissociative identity disorder (formerly known as multiple personality disorder), which made him a schizothymic or even schizophrenic type. In 1998–2000 Polish author Leszek Nowak (born 1962) from Poznań authored a study in which, based on his own history of delusions of mission and overvalued ideas, and information communicated in the Gospels, made an attempt at reconstructing Jesus’ psyche with the view of the apocalyptic prophet.

<text>Torrold DeShaun&quot;Rod&quot;Smart (born January 9, 1977) is a former professional American football running back. He played college football for Western Kentucky. He was originally signed by the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League (NFL) as an undrafted free agent after the 2000 NFL draft.

Smart first played a professional football season with the Las Vegas Outlaws of the original XFL, where he was known by the nickname &quot;He Hate Me&quot;. He then joined the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL) before signing with the Philadelphia Eagles, all within the same year (2001). He then spent four seasons (2002–2005) with the Carolina Panthers, including winning the NFC Championship in 2003. He also spent time with the Oakland Raiders in 2006, as well as Team Tennessee of the never-launched All American Football League.

==College career==
Smart was born in Lakeland, Florida, one of several children. His parents were known to give Rod and his siblings unusual nicknames, including &quot;Bone Bone&quot; and &quot;Fat Girl.&quot; He attended Lakeland High School, where he played both running back and cornerback for the football team, and also ran for the track team.

Smart attended Western Kentucky University, where he played for the Hilltoppers football team. He ended his career at Western Kentucky ranked tenth all-time in school history with 2,305 rushing yards on 356 carries with 21 touchdowns. He also recorded 115 receiving yards, 279 kickoff return yards, and 14 yards on punt returns. He started all 11 games as a senior in 1999 and was a first-team All-Gateway Conference selection. In his senior season, he led the team with 1,249 yards rushing and 10 touchdowns on 188 carries, for a 6.4 yard average, while his all purpose yards and rushing yards ranked fifth and sixth respectively in school history for a single season. He graduated with a degree in kinesiology.

===Track and field===
Smart was also a member of the track team at Western Kentucky, where he specialized in the 60 meters and 100 meters.

====Personal bests====
==Professional career==
===San Diego Chargers===
Smart signed with the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted rookie free agent in 2000. He finished training camp with the team, but was released by the Chargers prior to the start of the 2000 NFL season.

===Las Vegas Outlaws===
In the Spring of 2001, Smart joined the Las Vegas Outlaws of the XFL and adopted the nickname of &quot;He Hate Me&quot; which he wore on the back of his uniform. He finished the season ranked second in the league in rushing with 555 yards. He also finished third in average rushing yards (3.8 yards per carry), and scored three touchdowns over the course of the one and only XFL season. He led the Outlaws in rushing, and was second on the team in receiving with 27 catches for 245 yards.

Of the over 300 players to don an XFL uniform during its lone 2001 season, league executives noted that while most saw the league solely as a way to further their own careers in hopes of returning to the NFL, Smart fully embraced the league&#x27;s approach to football and sports entertainment. In the documentary &quot;This Was the XFL&quot;, Smart stated that had the league survived for a second season, he was certain to have returned and had no intention of trying out for an NFL or CFL position before the XFL collapsed.

====&quot;He Hate Me&quot;====
&quot;He Hate Me&quot; is the phrase Smart chose to place on the back of his Las Vegas Outlaws football jersey. Though most sports organizations allow only a surname or first initial and surname to be placed on the back of a jersey, XFL rules permitted players&#x27; jerseys to be stitched with whatever words they wanted. The Outlaws happened to be playing in the league&#x27;s first nationally televised game (the one that would, ultimately, be the most widely watched game, as the league&#x27;s viewership plummeted after that point), and the league&#x27;s choice of camera angles more akin to video games meant that Smart&#x27;s jersey was prominently featured on the telecasts. The jersey was the XFL&#x27;s best seller.

Smart explained the origin of the grammatically non-standard phrase in a January 30, 2004 article with the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; as, &quot;Basically, my opponent is going to hate me. After I win, he&#x27;s gonna hate me. It is what it is. It&#x27;s a saying I was saying when I&#x27;d feel something wasn&#x27;t going my way. For example, (when) I was on the squad in Vegas and coach was putting other guys in, (if) I felt I&#x27;m better than them, you know, hey, &#x27;he hate me.&#x27; See what I&#x27;m saying? Give me a chance. That&#x27;s all I ask. It came from the heart. Within. The way I felt. I feel as if everyone hates me, from my mom to my dad and even my brothers and sisters everyone &quot;Hates Me&quot;. My buddy Greg Kates always used to use it, so I took it from him.&quot;

Smart stated that he originally planned to use a different nickname on the back of his jersey every week of the season but abandoned that plan when &quot;He Hate Me&quot; became a national sensation. He and his agent also credit the nickname with getting NFL scouts to notice him after the XFL collapsed.

When Smart and the Outlaws played divisional rival the Los Angeles Xtreme, two Xtreme players put &quot;I Hate He&quot; and &quot;I Hate He Too&quot; on the back of their jerseys to express their disdain for Smart. In a later game between those two teams, those two players changed their nicknames to &quot;Still Hate He&quot; and &quot;Still Hate He Too&quot;. The curious maxim also caught the eye of American audiences (as well as Smart&#x27;s future Carolina Panthers teammate Jake Delhomme, who named one of his thoroughbreds, &quot;She Hate Me&quot;). The title of Spike Lee&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;She Hate Me&quot; was also inspired by Smart&#x27;s nickname.

===Edmonton Eskimos===
After the end of the XFL season Smart signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played one regular season game for Edmonton before being released in August 2001.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
The Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL signed Smart to their practice roster on October 2, 2001. He was promoted to the active roster on November 19, 2001, appeared in six regular season games, mainly on special teams, and rushed for six yards on two carries. The Eagles waived Smart at the end of their 2002 training camp.

===Carolina Panthers===
In September, 2002, Smart was claimed off waivers by the Carolina Panthers. He played in all 16 regular season games, and led the Panthers with 24 special teams tackles. He produced at least one special teams tackle in 14 games en route to recording the second-highest number of special team tackles in a season in team history.

In 2003, Smart played in all 16 Panthers&#x27; games for the second consecutive season. For the first time in a Panthers&#x27; uniform, he was utilized as a kick returner, in addition to his special teams coverage duties. He averaged 23.1 yards on 41 kickoff returns for 947 yards, including a 100-yard touchdown against the New Orleans Saints on October 5, 2003. He finished the Panthers&#x27; 2003 season ranked second with 14 special teams tackles and recorded his first career blocked punt. He also rushed for 49 yards on 20 carries and caught three passes for 11 yards on offense. He contributed to a Panthers&#x27; special teams coverage unit that ranked fifth in the NFL in opponents&#x27; kickoff return average. In Super Bowl XXXVIII, Smart returned four punts for 74 yards.

Smart&#x27;s 2004 season was cut short due to injuries. He played in the first three games of the season for the Panthers, but was inactive for the next four before being placed on injured reserve with an injured left knee on November 3, 2004. Despite his limited action in 2004, he averaged 21.1 yards on eight kickoff returns for 169 yards, with the longest return being 33 yards. He also rushed four yards on three carries, and caught one pass for five yards, on offense.

In 2005, Smart returned to the Panthers healthy, played in 12 games, and led the Panthers with 29 kickoff returns for 615 yards (for a 21.2 yard average). He also recorded nine tackles and one fumble recovery for the Panthers&#x27; kick coverage unit. After four seasons, Smart was released by the Panthers on March 1, 2006.

===Oakland Raiders===
On May 4, 2006, Smart signed with the Oakland Raiders as a free agent. Being injured for part of the 2006 pre-season, he failed to make the final, 53-man Raiders roster on September 2, 2006.

===All American Football League===
Smart was selected by Team Tennessee during the inaugural draft of the All American Football League on January 26, 2008. However, when the league was postponed for its inaugural season, all players were released from their contracts, leaving him a free agent.

==Post football==
After being released by the Oakland Raiders, Smart became a personal trainer, before appearing in &quot;Don’t Blame The Lettuce&quot;. He currently lives in Charlotte, North Carolina and purportedly works as a high school guidance counselor. He also owns his own business, SmartSize.

==Personal life==
Smart is a fan of 1970s funk and soul music bands such as Earth, Wind and Fire, Heatwave, and Parliament. He was the &quot;&quot; but managed to keep his grades well above average with all A&#x27;s and some B&#x27;s at Lakeland Senior High School. His nickname growing up and in high school was &quot;The Rocket&quot; after Raghib Ismail of Notre Dame, because of his speed, running a 4.25 second 40-yard dash. Smart&#x27;s younger brother is Chris Rainey, former Lakeland High School standout running back and former National Football League player. Smart&#x27;s first cousin is former Philadelphia Eagles receiver Freddie Mitchell.

On June 18, 2019, Lancaster County, South Carolina, sheriff&#x27;s deputies declared Smart &quot;missing and endangered&quot; after his family reported that his whereabouts had been unknown since June 12. He was reported by the sheriff&#x27;s office as having been found safe later the same day he was reported missing.

<text>Crimson Skies is a tabletop and a video game media franchise created by Jordan Weisman and Dave McCoy, first released as a board game in 1998 and then as a PC game in 2000.

The series&#x27; intellectual property is currently owned by Microsoft Corporation through its Xbox Game Studios division. Weisman&#x27;s former company, Smith &amp; Tinker Inc., had announced in 2007 that it had licensed the electronic entertainment rights to the franchise, but no new titles were developed.
The &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; trademark was renewed in 2013 by Microsoft for video games, although the trademark for other related media has been abandoned.

The series is set within an alternate history of the 1930s invented by Weisman and McCoy. Within this divergent timeline, the United States has collapsed, and air travel has become the most popular mode of transportation in North America; as a result, air pirates thrive in the world of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;. In describing the concept of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;, Jordan Weisman stated he wanted to &quot;take the idea of 16th century Caribbean piracy and translate into a 1930s American setting&quot;.

&quot;Crimson Skies&quot; was first conceived as a PC game known as &quot;Corsairs!&quot;, but was released first as a board game from FASA. The franchise has since expanded to include a collectible miniatures game from Wizkids, a miniature wargame from Ral Partha, as well as a series of books. The series also includes two arcade flight-based video games published by Microsoft Game Studios – &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; for the PC and &quot;Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge&quot; for the Xbox. Both games were well received by critics, though only the second was commercially successful.

&quot;Crimson Skies&quot; is an example of the dieselpunk genre, though it predated the genre name.

==Development history==
According to series creator Jordan Weisman, the original idea for &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; came after he had completed research on the early years of aviation; the era and historical characters inspired him to create a game about the period. For their game, Weisman and Dave McCoy settled on a post WWI European setting revolving around the &quot;knights of the air&quot;. However, a game with a similar idea came out then; Weisman and McCoy subsequently moved the setting to the U.S. and changed the concept to placing air pirates in a modern setting. From there, they crafted an alternate history to simulate the conditions that gave rise to piracy in the Caribbean in a 1930s setting. Weisman later said about the development of the universe: Whenever I create different universes—&quot;MechWarrior&quot;, &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;—to me, it&#x27;s all about looking at &#x27;What are the fantasies that excited us when we were 5?&#x27; And if we can find a new and more sophisticated way to tap into that fantasy [...] &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; is just combining two classic male fantasies: You get to be a pirate; you get to be a pilot.

Work on &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; began under the name &quot;Corsairs!&quot;. Development started for Virtual World Entertainment, and was later moved to a PC game when Virtual World merged with FASA Corporation. Although the &quot;Corsairs!&quot; project was shelved, Weisman and a group of FASA employees worked outside of business hours to create the &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; board game. According to Weisman: &quot;The board game was borne purely out of the fact that I needed to get this universe out of our heads and into the world, and it was the best venue to do so quickly&quot;. Developer John Howard has stated that the board game was built to &quot;showcase the Crimson Skies property, with an eye towards expanding on it in other ways&quot;.

When FASA Interactive became a part of Microsoft, Weisman and his team were able to start a new game, and work on the PC version of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; began; the game was developed by Zipper Interactive. The game utilizes arcade flight mechanics, focusing on action, as opposed to a realistic portrayal of the physics of flight. The game&#x27;s relaxed physics as well as its focus on barnstorming led GameSpot to comment that &quot;&quot;Crimson Skies&quot; is very much based on a &#x27;movie reality&#x27; where if it&#x27;s fun and looks good, it works&quot;.

The Xbox game &quot;Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge&quot; was later developed as a first-party title for Microsoft Game Studios by FASA Studio. Like the previous game, arcade flight elements were incorporated in order to focus gameplay on action instead of flight mechanics. Early in the game&#x27;s production, developers decided upon a &quot;playable movie&quot; concept, but found that gameplay would be restricted by this approach. Consequently, the game&#x27;s release date was pushed back by approximately one year to allow the development team time to retool the game. The results of this extra development period include more open-ended gameplay features and Xbox Live support.

After development concluded on &quot;High Road to Revenge&quot;, the developers moved to work on another &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; title for Microsoft; development, however, was cancelled shortly into the project. When FASA Studio was later shut down, Microsoft retained the video game rights to &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;, although it had no immediate plans for the IP. Weisman&#x27;s latest company, Smith &amp; Tinker, later &quot;licensed from Microsoft the electronic entertainment rights&quot; to &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;. Although the company has made no formal announcement as to its plans with the franchise, Weisman has assured fans that there will be a new entry in the series.

==Universe==
===Backstory===
The &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; series takes place in an alternate 1930s in which the U.S. has broken apart into a number of independent nation states. According to series creator Jordan Weisman: I needed to create a geo-political situation that would result in air-pirates, so I looked at the real political situation that gave rise to the pirates of the Caribbean in the 16th and 17th centuries. We needed a balkanized era so that pirates could escape quickly into another country&#x27;s territory, we needed things of value to be moved by air, and we needed a constantly churning political environment so that things did not settle down quickly. [...] It took only three little changes in the history of the United States to get us the dynamic world of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;.

This alternate timeline incorporates both fictional and actual historic events. According to the series&#x27; official backstory, the divergent timeline begins after World War I, when a &quot;Regionalist movement&quot; gains popularity in America following the Spanish influenza pandemic, rallying behind an isolationist platform. Meanwhile, President Wilson&#x27;s authority was undercut when Prohibition failed as a constitutional amendment leaving the matter to be decided on the state level. The nation soon became polarized between &quot;wet&quot; and &quot;dry&quot; states and checkpoints became a common sight on state borders to stop the flow of alcohol into &quot;dry&quot; states. As the decade progressed, state governments seized more authority, encroaching into areas formerly the responsibility of the federal government, and formed regional power blocs.
The optimism of the Roaring Twenties was upset in 1927 when an outbreak of a deadly strain of influenza in America prompted states to close their borders, further dividing the Union. Though not as deadly as the 1918 pandemic, the epidemic had immense political fallout, bolstering regionalist &quot;strong state&quot; views and decreasing voter turnout in the 1928 election. Shortly after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Texas seceded from the United States, reforming the Republic of Texas on January 1, 1930. New York was the next state to secede, and persuaded Pennsylvania and New Jersey to merge with it to form the Empire State. California followed suit, creating the Nation of Hollywood, as did Utah, which had already come in conflict with the federal government after the establishment of the Smith Law in 1928 that made Mormonism the state religion. Washington, D.C., essentially powerless, was unable to stop the country from falling apart. The federal government made its last stand against the &quot;People&#x27;s Revolt&quot; of the bread basket states. When the US Army was defeated by the People&#x27;s Collective (formerly the Midwest) forces in 1931, the fate of the United States was sealed, and the rest of the country dissolved into independent nations by the end of 1932 with the last legal remnant of the US being the neutral nation of Columbia in what used to be whatever area around Washington could be seized.

Though not directly affected by the Texas Secession, Canada found itself dragged down by the collapse of the U.S., with Quebec seceding in 1930 and the rest of the provinces siding with their nascent southern neighbors: New Brunswick and parts of Quebec joined the Maritime Provinces of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; Newfoundland joined Quebec; Manitoba joined the People&#x27;s Collective as did parts of Saskatchewan, with the Lakota nation laying claim to the rest; British Columbia merged with Oregon and Washington in the Pacific Northwest; and Alaska claimed the Yukon territories. The core of the former Canadian government established the Protectorate of Ontario. While Ottawa&#x27;s authority technically extends to Alberta and the Northwest Territories, these areas are mostly no-man&#x27;s land, while Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island comprise a self-governing body, commonly referred to as the Northumberland Association.

In 1931, the Territorial Government of Hawaii was left defenseless in the wake of the fragmenting country and was overthrown in favor of reestablishing the Hawaiian monarchy with Jonah Kūhiō as its king. Likewise, America&#x27;s territorial holdings overseas were surrendered following the nation&#x27;s formal collapse and the formation of the Federal Republic of Columbia on March 1, 1932.

The resulting nation states that formed were no longer unified—distrust between them strained diplomatic relations to the point that several small-scale wars broke out.

After the dissolution of the United States, the country&#x27;s interstate railroad and highway systems fell into disrepair or were sabotaged as they crossed hostile borders. Consequently, ground-based vehicles such as the locomotive and automobile were replaced by aircraft such as the airplane and the zeppelin as the leading mode of transportation in North America. Europe soon followed this fascination with aviation to make its own strides into the new, aerially-dominated market. Gangs of air pirates formed in turn to plunder airborne commerce. Although air militias formed to counter the threat, rivalries between the nations of North America reduced their capacity to effectively address this issue, and even encouraged the countries to sponsor pirates as privateers so as to direct their illegal operations against opposing nations. In Europe, privateers and other mercenary groups were widely adopted by nations who wished to avoid another world war, especially in the case of the Spanish Civil War.

By the end of 1937, North America was a &quot;hotbed of conflict&quot;, with multiple pirate gangs and air militias battling for control of the skies. Europe was no better, as Germany jockeyed for power while France and Britain looked the other way. The Russian States continued to fight their civil war, which threatened to spill over into the Eastern European nations and Alaska. Asia, too, was on the brink, with Japan&#x27;s recent invasion of China and the continuation of the bloody civil war in Australia.

===Aircraft and technology===
The planes of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; are fictional designs created to fit within the &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; universe. Although some planes were modeled after actual 1930s era experimental aircraft and other &quot;bizarre and outlandish designs&quot; from the early years of aviation, they still take significant departures from conventional aviation design. Jordan Weisman has stated that the planes in &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; are designed to be the &quot;hot rods of the air&quot;. According to IGN, &quot;the planes in CS are built for style and not function with their redundant wing positions and rear propellers&quot;. For example, the Devastator aircraft features a pusher propeller and a biplane design.

Because of the history of the world of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;, especially given that the nation states of North America are constantly at war with one another and that air travel is the primary means of transportation, advancements in both aircraft and weaponry technology would have proceeded at a faster pace than had actually happened in the same time period. Zeppelins with hangar launch bays that can accommodate escort fighters are featured prominently in &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;; in actuality, only a few zeppelin-based airborne aircraft carriers saw service. Zeppelins in &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; are also armed with broadside cannons and are also heavily armored. Radio-controlled rockets are also available in the &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; universe, which can be controlled remotely after launch.

Other technologies are exclusive to the world of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;. Magnetic rockets have the ability to track planes or weapon emplacements over a short distance. Aerial torpedoes are similar to sea-based torpedoes, but are specifically designed to take out airships. Beeper/seeker rockets are designed to work in tandem. The &quot;beeper&quot; rocket attaches to a target and emits a homing signal; the &quot;seeker&quot; rocket follows the homing signal, destroying the target.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beeper/Seeker&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Choker rocket disables the target&#x27;s engine by bursting into a fireball that burns all oxygen around it. The Tesla cannon is a tesla coil-style weapon that fires a bolt of electricity at a target, disabling it. Also featured in &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; is the wind turbine, a weather control mechanism designed to generate storms.

==Games==
===FASA board game===

The &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; board game was released by FASA in 1998. The base game came with card stock, assemble-yourself airplanes included, but later metal miniature planes were offered separately. While the focus was on fantasy over fact, many of the planes in &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; were modeled after real experimental aircraft of the era.

The complex universe of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; earned many devoted fans, as dozens of different weapons, planes, nations, air forces, bands of pirates, and characters were all given detailed pasts, and several additional supplemental campaigns were published.

===Microsoft PC game===

The PC game &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; was developed by Zipper Interactive and released in 2000. The game&#x27;s storyline is framed around a radio drama that chronicles the adventures of Nathan Zachary and the Fortune Hunters pirate gang during their rise to fame and fortune. Gameplay centers on the control of one of the game&#x27;s playable aircraft, which the player can customize with different parts to alter performance. The game&#x27;s flight mechanics were designed to be a compromise between realistic and arcade flight.

One of &quot;Crimson Skies&quot;&#x27; unique gameplay features was the inclusion of &quot;danger zones&quot;—challenging areas through which the player can fly for various effects. The game&#x27;s focus on barnstorming and relaxed flight physics led GameSpot to comment that &quot;&quot;Crimson Skies&quot; is very much based on a &#x27;movie reality&#x27; where if it&#x27;s fun and looks good, it works&quot;. However, the game&#x27;s original release was plagued with numerous technical problems, most notably the unreliability of the player&#x27;s saved game files. Though a patch was released to remedy this issue, the game still retains many technical issues such as long loading times and sluggish menu screens.

===Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge===

&quot;Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge&quot; is an Xbox game developed by FASA Studio and released in 2003. The game centers on Nathan Zachary and the Fortune Hunters, in their crusade to avenge the death of a close friend, Dr. Fassenbiender, at the hands of the &quot;Die Spinne&quot; organization. Developers decided early on in the game&#x27;s production cycle that the game would not simply be a port of the PC title, and by the end of the development cycle, many of the story elements that linked the game to the PC game had been excised.

Although the game is similar to the PC game in that gameplay centers on controlling an aircraft, a new feature is the ability for the player to switch aircraft or man fixed weapon emplacements during a mission. The game&#x27;s mission structure also features a number of other open-ended elements that have led to comparisons with the sandbox gameplay of the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games. The game additionally boasted a number of online gameplay modes over Xbox Live.

===WizKids collectible miniatures game===
In 2003, Wizkids released the &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; collectible miniatures game. The game utilizes collectible figures featuring both planes and pilots from the &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; universe. These miniatures use WizKids&#x27; Clix system, by which a character&#x27;s or plane&#x27;s statistics and abilities can be altered during gameplay by way of an adjustable dial located on the base of the figure.

The &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; miniatures game comprises two separate games, each with its own set of rules. The gameplay in &quot;Crimson Skies: Aces&quot; revolves around pilots battling each other on the ground, while the gameplay in &quot;Crimson Skies: Air Action&quot; focuses on dogfighting between squadrons of aircraft. Figures were sold in &quot;squadron packs&quot; and &quot;ace packs&quot;, which were formatted in blisterpacks as opposed to the random packaging format used in other Wizkids games.

==Books==
In addition to the tabletop and video games, the &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; series also features a number of tie-in books and short stories.

Spicy Air Tales was published by FASA in 1999. The two-volume series featured short stories that originally appeared on the Crimson Skies website and supplemental material for using characters and planes from the stories with the boardgame.

<text>The Chevrolet Chevette is a front-engine, rear-drive subcompact manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet for model years 1976–1987 as a three-door or five-door hatchback. Introduced in North America in September 1975, the Chevette superseded the Vega as Chevrolet&#x27;s entry-level subcompact.

Production reached 2.8 million over 12 years, and the Chevette was the best-selling small car in the U.S. for model years 1979-1980. It was the first American car built to metric measurements, and was the first American car to feature a diagnostic plug for pinpointing service issues.

The Chevette used General Motors&#x27; global rear-drive T platform which was co-developed by Opel and Isuzu in 1973. The first to use the T plaform was the Brazilian Chevrolet Chevette released in 1973. Six months later the Opel Kadett C was released in Europe. Worldwide, GM manufactured and marketed more than 7 million T-cars – either as rebadged models or locally-built versions in different countries. T-platform variants were marketed internationally as the Pontiac Acadian in Canada; Pontiac T1000/1000 in the United States (1981–1987); K-180 in Argentina; Vauxhall Chevette in the United Kingdom, Austria, France, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, and Uruguay; Opel Kadett C in Germany; Isuzu Gemini in Japan, Holden Gemini in Australia; AYMESA Cóndor in Ecuador (from 1978); Saehan Gemini and Daewoo Maepsy in South Korea; and as a coupe utility (pickup), the Chevy (or GMC) 500 in Brazil and South America. A T-platform variant remained in production in South America through 1998.

Introduced with a full-color nationwide campaign in 140–150 of the country&#x27;s largest daily papers, the &quot;New York Times&quot; said the &quot;little American car holds its own with the foreigners.&quot;

Marketed as “Chevrolet’s New Kind of American Car,” the Chevette was of a conventional design: featuring unibody construction, rear-drive and a live rear axle. Looking back on the Chevette in 2011, the New York Times called the Chevette &quot;haphazardly made, sparsely trimmed and underpowered.&quot; Consumer Guide described the Chevette as “unimaginative to an extreme.”

==Development==
Under the direction of chief engineer John Mowrey, Chevrolet began developing the Chevette on December 24, 1973. It was a response to the federal CAFE standards and the 1973 oil crisis. The Chevette was prompted by GM&#x27;s Energy Task Force, which arose out of the crisis and the resultant shift in consumer demand to smaller, foreign vehicles boasting greater fuel efficiency.

The Chevette was based on GM&#x27;s World Car, Project 909 – what would become the &quot;T-car&quot; program, so named because the vehicles shared GM&#x27;s T platform. With the well-known problems of its predecessor, the Vega, including production, reliability and corrosion issues, the team reworked the international platform for the Chevette, ultimately sharing no actual body panels with other T-platform variants. The underbody was reworked extensively to enhance corrosion protection. The Chevette&#x27;s 1.4-liter base iron-block engine weighed 59 lb less than the Vega&#x27;s much-heralded aluminum-block engine. GM reportedly saved 8-12 months in development time by piggybacking the Chevette&#x27;s development on the T Platform. 

The first North American Chevette, a low level trim two-door hatchback marketed as the &quot;Chevette Scooter&quot;, was assembled on August 18, 1975 and officially introduced on September 16, in Washington, DC, with the first models going on sale on October 2, just after new legislation-mandated Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. With initial projected sales of 275,000 units in its first year, numbers were cut in half as the price of oil stabilized. Production reached 2,793,353 over its 12 model years 1976–1987. Global T-car sales surpassed 7 million in the end. The last Chevette was manufactured on December 23, 1986, at Lakewood Assembly – following the end of production at Wilmington Assembly in September, 1985. The last Chevette manufactured was a light-blue two-door hatchback shipped to a Chevrolet dealer in Springdale, Ohio.

The T-car had been launched internationally in Brazil under the Chevette name in 1973, as a two-door sedan and ultimately a four-door sedan, a two-door hatchback, and a two-door station wagon (named &quot;Marajó&quot;), as well as a utility (named the Chevy 500), produced until 1994.

==Initial features and annual updates==
The Chevette itself was initially available only as a two-door hatchback with a 1.4-liter OHV or 1.6-liter OHV gasoline inline-four engine. Engines produced from (subsequently ), driving the rear wheels. 
A four-speed manual transmission was standard, while a three-speed automatic transmission was optional. Other features included rack-and-pinion steering, front disc brakes, front stabilizer bar, 13-inch tires, tricolor taillights, front bucket seats, an onboard diagnostic system, extensive acoustic insulation, a single steering column-mounted stalk (integrating controls for signal indicators, wipers, and windshield washers), and factory options including swing-out rear quarter windows, AM/FM radio, analog clock, delayed wipers, and a chrome &quot;Bright Package&quot;. Front seats featured inertia locking mechanisms that enabled entry and exit adjustment of the front seatback without using a separate release.

Canadian model: Pontiac marketed a rebadged variant in Canada as the &quot;Acadian&quot;. In addition to being the smallest, most fuel-efficient car marketed by Chevrolet, the Chevette was the lightest car marketed in the U.S. The EPA rated the base 1.4-liter engine at city and highway. Chevrolet claimed that the Chevette&#x27;s turning circle () was one of the smallest in the world and that it was essentially a &quot;metric&quot; car, &quot;international in design and heritage&quot;. The 1976–1978 Chevettes can be identified by round headlights. Chrome-rimmed, tricolor taillights were used from 1976 to 1979.

Rally and Woody trim: the Rally 1.6 included a 1.6-liter (98 cu in) engine in lieu of the 1.4-liter (85 cu in) overhead-cam four-cylinder, rated at instead of , along with a rear stabilizer and special body graphics. The Chevette Woody (1976) featured simulated wood-grain siding and upgraded interior and exterior trim. 

Scooter trim: the least expensive &quot;Scooter&quot; trim carried a $2,899 suggested retail price () and was substantially decontented; equipment included only two front passenger seats and an optional rear seat, deletion of most exterior chrome, painted rather than chrome bumpers, an open glove box, black carpeting, black instrument panel, door-pull straps in lieu of arm rests, fiberboard door panels, fender without antenna accommodation, side and rear decals instead of cast metal emblems, untinted glass and deleted sun visor and passenger seat fore-aft adjustment. The Scooter model created a controversy at introduction, with critics contending the trim level was only marketed to allow a lower advertised price, but without a true intention to sell many. Lee Iacocca subsequently announced Ford would introduce its &quot;Pinto Pony MPG&quot; model, undercutting the Scooter price by $4 and including a back seat. GM contended the Scooter model was a genuine &quot;urban utility&quot; vehicle, and sold approximately 5% of all production in Scooter trim with 9,810 &quot;Scooter&quot; models manufactured, compared to 178,007 regular hatchbacks.Ultimately the Scooter competed with other similarly decontented models from competing manufacturers, e.g., the Volkswagen Beetle &quot;Type 110&quot;, and Dodge Colt Coupe M/M Mileage Maker.

1977: For 1977, the engines were and . The Scooter hatchback included a rear seat, with a rear-seat delete option. The Sandpiper trim package included a “reef”-patterned interior, deluxe door trim, cream gold or antique white exterior colors, and an exterior Sandpiper logo just behind each door.

1978: For 1978, a new four-door hatchback used a wheelbase, two inches longer than the two-door – ultimately accounting for more than half of the Chevette&#x27;s nearly 300,000 sales. All models featured a revised grille with a grid design, while the chrome grille and headlight frames became standard. The 1.4-liter engine and Woody package were dropped with a fuel door added. A TH-180 automatic transmission was added to replace the THM-200 series automatic. An &quot;HO&quot; (high output) version was available in addition to the standard 1.6-liter, featuring a modified head and a larger valves-cam profile. The HO package also included a dual-outlet exhaust manifold. Prices were dropped and more standard equipment was added for 1978. Air conditioning, radial tires, an AM/FM radio, and power brakes were optional.

1979: For 1979, the Holley two-barrel carburetor became standard on all models. The front fascia was revised with a flat hood, no longer wrapping down to the bumper. New for 1979 was a large chrome grille with Chevrolet&#x27;s &quot;bow-tie&quot; emblem and rectangular headlights. A new air-injection system was introduced to improve catalytic-converter function at idle. An active passenger-restraint system was introduced in small numbers as an option which featured a lower hanging dashboard, automatic seatbelts, and a center-dash console. Chevette sales totaled more than 451,000 units – a figure that would rank it second only to Chevrolet&#x27;s new Citation, which had a much longer model run (sales had started in April 1979). &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; testers managed &quot;an honest 29 mpg in the city and 39 mpg on the highway&quot;. 

1980: For MY 1980 rear fascia was revised with a squared-off hatch, wraparound taillights with combined, single-colored turn signals, and a round gas-filler door.

1981 In August 1981, a diesel engine option was new with a late 1981 availability – this is a 1.8-liter Isuzu unit only available coupled to an Isuzu five-speed. The powertrain is the same as was installed in the Isuzu I-Mark. It was not available with air conditioning. New styled-steel wheels with center caps were offered, and the previous wheel and hubcap design was discontinued. Domestic models received a new computer command control feedback system on gasoline engines. The HO option was discontinued. Electronic spark timing was used on 1981 models in place of mechanical timing advance. A new engine cylinder head design (swirl-port) was introduced to improve low-end torque and fuel economy. The Pontiac T1000 was introduced in the spring of 1981 for both the U.S. and Canadian markets, which shared all body stampings with the Chevette, featuring a chrome center with black-trimmed grille and headlight buckets, as well as standard chrome window trim with black area fill. The T1000 also had additional fresh-air vents at the outer ends of the dashboard. This gave Canadian Pontiac dealers 2 versions of the T-car: the Acadian and the T1000 (later, simply &quot;1000&quot;) concurrently from 1981 to 1985. Power steering was a new option for the Chevette, as well as a 3.36 axle ratio (standard on T1000 models). The active passenger-restraint system was discontinued. New lighter-weight bucket seats were introduced that lacked much of the lower support of the heavier &quot;panned&quot; seats. A new adhesive-based, thinner windshield seal replaced the lock-ring type.

1982: For MY 1982, models featured a five-speed manual transmission option on gasoline-powered two-door cars (standard with diesel). The Scooter was newly available as a four-door hatchback. New GM THM-180C (THM200C for diesel model) automatic transmissions, which included a locking torque converter for greater fuel mileage, were available. Introduction of a pump-driven AIR system in the late model year replaced PAIR to help efficiency of the catalytic converter. A new catalytic converter was introduced with an air inlet for forced air injection from the air pump. A new one-piece cardboard-based headliner with an updated overhead dome light replaced the earlier vinyl liner. The Pontiac T1000 received a unique grille, body molding, and horizontal lined taillights, as well as an alloy sport wheel option. General Motors of Canada&#x27;s Pontiac Acadian, a rebadged Chevette, received all the T1000&#x27;s Pontiac-exclusive features from this point on. Chevrolet sold 433,000 Chevettes in 1981 and 233,000 in 1982.
1983: For MY 1983, the Chevette featured revised front and rear fascia, and the Chevette CS was introduced. A black-finished grille and trim moldings replaced most chrome pieces. Scooter and base Chevettes featured black bumpers and end caps, while the higher-end Chevette CS models included color-keyed bumpers and caps with chrome bumper inserts as an option. Scooter and base models featured a black-only grille and headlight buckets, while CS models featured argent-colored trim. The Chevette S model introduced a cosmetic package that included black-painted styled-steel wheels and a red-accented grille and moldings, as well as oversized decal emblems in red. Front bucket seats featured new adjustable knobs on the sides, but lost the reclining levers of previous years. Interior trim was also blacked out with new black door handles and black plastic window regulators. An integrated cassette deck was optional with the stereo package. A chrome strip on the dashboard was available only on CS and S models until the end of production. Deluxe door panels were discontinued and all models featured plastic door panels, but base and Scooter models still featured laminated cardboard cargo area panels. The &quot;diagnostic connector&quot; was removed from the wiring harness.
1984: For MY 1984, the low-cost &quot;Scooter&quot; model was discontinued for the US and retained for Canadian production. The &quot;T1000&quot; was renamed &quot;Pontiac 1000&quot; in 1983 both in the U.S. and Canada. 

1985: MY 1985 models carried few updates from the 1984 models. 

1986: For MY 1986, the Chevette base model was discontinued, leaving only the CS and the S, which featured a third brake light, an instrument cluster &quot;service engine soon&quot; light, replacing the &quot;check engine&quot; light, and a new bowtie emblem on the front grille.

1987: For MY 1987, Chevrolet dropped the Chevette S model and the diesel engine option (after 324 were sold in 1986, plus 264 diesel-engined Pontiac 1000). These were the last North American market General Motors diesel passenger cars built for many decades, following the discontinuation of the Oldsmobile Diesel engine. The Chevette&#x27;s price was also dropped to $4,995. Sales fell to just over 46,000 units, and production ended on December 23, 1986.

==Electrovette==
In 1978, General Motors Advanced Engineering developed a concept car, the Electrovette, based on the Chevette, but using an electric motor powered by lead-acid batteries. It was a strict two-seater and sat on a shortened wheelbase, with the batteries mounted in the rear. The car had a range of about at , and a top speed of .
==Leata Cabalero==
A luxury variant of the Chevette, the Leata Cabalero, was manufactured and marketed for model years 1976 and 1977 by Stinebaugh Manufacturing Company, founded by Donald E. Stinebaugh (1916–1992) with his son Leonard D. &quot;Sonny&quot; Stinebaugh (1946–2001) in Post Falls, Idaho. Donald Stinebaugh named the car after his wife Hilda (Erickson) Stinebaugh, giving the car her nickname, Leata – a misspelling of &quot;,&quot; Norwegian for &quot;little&quot; in feminine form.

The Leata featured power windows, power seat and cruise control – as well as baroque styling with custom fiberglass body panels, round headlights in square bezels, a rectangular &quot;classic&quot; grille, and heavily styled fenders; 97 were made either in pickup or hatchback body styles.
==Latin America==
The Chevrolet Chevette was first launched by General Motors (Brazil) in 1973 as a two-door sedan. A four-door sedan followed in April 1978, and then a three-door hatchback was added in November 1979. The hatchback had unique bodywork for Latin America, longer than the European Kadett City and with a notch at the base à la the period Ford Escort. A three-door station wagon version, called the &quot;Marajó&quot; in Brazil, was added in September 1980, as was a sporting version of the hatchback called the 1.6 SR (with a mere four more horsepower, achieved by a somewhat higher compression ratio). In 1983, the Chevette received a thorough facelift with rectangular headlights, with the turn signals located underneath the headlights, a flatter hood, and a single-piece grille. The dash was also new, as were ventilation windows in the front doors. Mechanically, the 1.6 was now also available to run on &quot;gasoól&quot; and a five-speed manual gearbox was available as an option.

The Latin American Chevettes underwent a series of facelifts, in 1978, 1983, and a major one in 1987, which meant new headlights and a black plastic grille. Where available, the station wagon used the Chevette name outside of Brazil.
The hatchback remained in production until 1988, while the Marajó continued to be available until 1989. Marajó is an island located at the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil. The four-door sedan version was built until 1989, mainly for export to other Latin American countries. The two-door sedan remained in production until 1993, only outlived by the pickup version (Chevy 500), which continued until 1994 after having been first launched in 1983. The four-door sedan continued to be built for a few more years in Ecuador and Colombia.
The Chevette originally appeared with a 1.4-liter single overhead cam inline-four. In 1981 this was augmented by a locally developed 1.6-liter version, it too with a single carburetor. The Brazilian 1.4 and 1.6 were similar to but not the same as the EPA compliant North American 1.4 and 1.6. For 1988, the 1.6 gained a twin-carb setup and now produced rather than the in earlier version. This engine remained available until the end of Brazilian Chevette production. The lower-powered 1.4 was only available for gasohol as of 1981 and was discontinued entirely after 1982. A gasohol-powered version of the 1.6 appeared in its stead for 1983.

As a tax cut for sub-1-liter cars appeared in late 1990, General Motors do Brasil responded with the 1.0-litre &quot;Chevette Junior&quot; for early 1992. This used a narrow-bore, short-stroke version of the OHC engine with a catalytic converter. The Junior did not do particularly well in the market, competing against the much more modern Fiat Uno Mille, Volkswagen Gol, and Ford Escort Hobby. Being rather underpowered and heavy at , with a top speed of , the 1.0 had a brief sales life. It only remained available until 1993, after which the Corsa took over. A 1.8-liter Isuzu diesel-engined version was also built in Uruguay, exclusively for the Uruguayan market. In the Brazilian market, both the 1.4 and the 1.6 were available in gasoline and alcohol versions.

In Argentina, the Kadett C was originally marketed as the Opel K-180, but between 1992 and 1995, the equivalent of the Brazilian Chevette was sold there as the GMC Chevette. Production in Colombia, where a special version for taxi usage was also built, continued until 1998. The Chevette was the number-one seller in Chile for some time, last in 1991. The Chevette was made locally in Chile in 2-door and 4-door form from 1976 to 1983 while the Marajo station wagon was always imported from Brazil as was the Chevy 500 pickup. After 1983, all Chevettes in Chile were imported from Brazil. When catalytic converters were made a requirement in that country, GMB was unable to develop such an engine and the Chevette was withdrawn from the Chilean market after the 1992 model year.

Around 1.6 million units were built in Brazil, with the Corsa replacing the Junior and the Chevrolet Kadett/Ipanema replacing the bigger-engined versions. About one quarter of the production was exported.

===Chevy 500===

The Chevrolet Chevy 500 was the coupé utility version of the Brazilian Chevette. Launched in 1983, it was the precursor to the Classic/Corsa/Montana lineup of today. It competed with offerings from several other manufacturers, including the Fiat Fiorino, Ford Pampa, and Volkswagen Saveiro. Its payload was . Using the 1.6-liter OHC inline four rated at 70 hp, this model continued in production until 1994, and was the last Chevette version built in Brazil, where it was replaced by the coupé utility version of Chevrolet Corsa.

===Grumett===
Created by Horacio Torrendell, a fibreglass-bodied version (actually based on the Vauxhall Chevette&#x27;s bodywork) called the Grumett was built in Uruguay. It was available either as a station wagon, as a pickup, or as a double-cab pickup. This replaced an earlier version (since 1976) which used bodywork based on that of the Vauxhall Viva, as well as Vauxhall mechanics. By 1980 the Vauxhall parts had become impossible to import and Grumett switched to Chevette parts from Brazil. The Grumett used the original 1.4-liter version of the Chevette engine. The regular Chevette was also assembled in Uruguay, by General Motors Uruguaya. It was sold there as a two- or four-door sedan, either with the 1.4 petrol or the 1.8 diesel.

<text>Magnolia grandiflora, commonly known as the southern magnolia or bull bay, is a tree of the family Magnoliaceae native to the Southeastern United States, from Virginia to central Florida, and west to East Texas. Reaching in height, it is a large, striking evergreen tree, with large, dark-green leaves up to long and wide, and large, white, fragrant flowers up to in diameter.

Although endemic to the evergreen lowland subtropical forests on the Gulf and South Atlantic coastal plain, &quot;M. grandiflora&quot; is widely cultivated in warmer areas around the world. The timber is hard and heavy, and has been used commercially to make furniture, pallets, and veneer.

==Description==

&quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot; is a medium to large evergreen tree which may grow tall. It typically has a single stem (or trunk) and a pyramidal shape. The leaves are simple and broadly ovate, long and broad, with smooth margins. They are dark green, stiff, and leathery, and often scurfy underneath with yellow-brown pubescence.

The large, showy, lemon citronella-scented flowers are white, up to across and fragrant, with six to 12 petals with a waxy texture, emerging from the tips of twigs on mature trees in late spring.

Flowering is followed by the rose-colored fruit, ovoid polyfollicle, long, and wide.

Exceptionally large trees have been reported in the far Southern United States. The national champion is a specimen in Smith County, Mississippi, that stands . Another record includes a 35-m-high specimen from the Chickasawhay District, De Soto National Forest, in Mississippi, which measured 17.75 ft (5.4 m) in circumference at breast height, from 1961, and a 30-m-tall tree from Baton Rouge, which reached 18 ft in circumference at breast height.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;M. grandiflora&quot; was one of the many species first described by Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1759, basing his description on the earlier notes of Miller. He did not select a type specimen. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin words &quot;grandis&quot; &quot;big&quot;, and &quot;flor-&quot; &quot;flower&quot;. The genus name &quot;Magnolia&quot; honors Pierre Magnol, a French botanist.

&quot;M. grandiflora&quot; is most commonly known as southern magnolia, a name derived from its range in the Southern United States. Many broadleaved evergreen trees are known as bays for their resemblance to the leaves of the red bay (&quot;Persea borbonia&quot;), with this species known as the bull bay for its huge size or alternatively because cattle have been reported eating its leaves. Laurel magnolia, evergreen magnolia, large-flower magnolia or big laurel are alternative names. The timber is known simply as magnolia.
==Distribution and habitat==
Southern magnolias are native to the Southeastern United States, from Virginia south to central Florida, and then west to East Texas. The tree is found on the edges of bodies of water and swamps, in association with sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), water oak (&quot;Quercus nigra&quot;), and black tupelo (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;). In more sheltered habitats, it grows into a large tree, but can be a low shrub when found on coastal dunes. It is killed by summer fires, and is missing from habitats that undergo regular burning.

In Florida, it is found in a number of different ecological areas that are typically shady and have well-draining soils; it is also found in hummocks, along ravines, on slopes, and in wooded floodplains. Despite preferring sites with increased moisture, it does not tolerate inundation. It grows on sandhills in maritime forests, where it is found growing with live oaks and saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;). In the eastern United States, it has become an escapee, and has become naturalized in the tidewater area of Virginia and locally in other areas outside of its historically natural range.

Alongside a number of other magnolias, the southern magnolia has proven capable of surviving the cool winters of the British Isles. It was introduced to Great Britain in 1728, and, as well as being a popular ornamental plant, has become naturalised.

==Ecology==

&quot;M. grandiflora&quot; can produce seed by 10 years of age, although peak seed production is achieved closer to 25 years of age. Around 50% of seeds can germinate, and they are spread by birds and mammals. Squirrels, possums, quail, and turkey are known to eat the seeds.

==Cultivation and uses==
Plant collector Mark Catesby, the first in North America, brought &quot;M. grandiflora&quot; to Britain in 1726, where it entered cultivation and overshadowed &quot;M. virginiana&quot;, which had been collected a few years earlier. It had also come to France, the French having collected it in the vicinity of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. It was glowingly described by Philip Miller in his 1731 work &quot;The Gardeners&#x27; Dictionary&quot;. One of the earliest people to cultivate it in Europe was Sir John Colliton of Exeter in Devon; scaffolding and tubs surrounded his tree, where gardeners propagated its branches by layering, the daughter plants initially selling for five guineas each (but later falling to half a guinea).


It is often planted in university campuses and allowed to grow into a large tree, either with dependent branches, or with the lower branches removed to display the bare trunks. It is also espaliered against walls, which improves its frost hardiness. It is often planted ornamentally in urban areas due to its resistance to air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide 

==United States cultivation==
&quot;M. grandiflora&quot; is a very popular ornamental tree throughout its native range in the coastal plain of the Gulf/South Atlantic states. Grown for its attractive, shiny green leaves and fragrant flowers, it has a long history in the Southern United States. Many large and very old specimens can be found in the subtropical port cities such as Houston; New Orleans; Mobile, Alabama; Jacksonville, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; and Wilmington, North Carolina. &quot;M. grandiflora&quot; is the state tree of Mississippi and the state flower of Louisiana.
The species is also cultivated as far north as coastal areas of New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island, New York, and Delaware, and in much of the Chesapeake Bay region in Maryland, and eastern Virginia. On the West Coast, it can be grown as far north as the Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada area, though cooler summers on the West Coast slow its growth compared to the East Coast. In the interior of the US, some of the cold-hardy cultivars have flourished as far north as Louisville, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio, where a sizable population exists. Farther north, few known long-term specimens are found due to the severe winters, and/or lack of sufficient summer heat. Seeds may promote health and prevent diseases like high blood pressure, heart disturbances and epilepsy.

&quot;M. grandiflora&quot; is also grown in parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America, as well as parts of Asia.

Until early 2018, an iconic southern magnolia planted by President Andrew Jackson nearly 200 years earlier grew near the South Portico of the White House. It was reputedly planted as a seedling taken from Jackson&#x27;s plantation, The Hermitage in Tennessee. It was the oldest tree on the White House grounds and was so famous that it was for decades pictured on the back of the $20 bill as part of a view of the South Front. There was a tradition of giving cuttings or seedlings grown from the tree: Reagan gave a cutting to his Chief of Staff Howard Baker upon his retirement, and Michelle Obama donated a seedling to the &quot;people&#x27;s garden&quot; of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Since the 1940s, when the tree suffered a gash that caused a large section of its trunk to rot, the tree had been supported by metal poles and cables. In 2017, it was decided on the advice of the National Arboretum to cut down and remove the magnolia because the trunk was in an extremely fragile condition and the supports had been compromised. Offshoots from the Jackson magnolia have been saved, grown up to 10ft and one was planted at the place of the original tree. 

It is recommended for seashore plantings in areas that are windy but have little salt spray. The foliage will bronze, blotch, and burn in severe winters at the northern limits of cultivation, especially when grown in full winter sun, but most leaves remain until they are replaced by new foliage in the spring. In climates where the ground freezes, winter sun appears to do more damage than the cold. In the Northern Hemisphere, the south side of the tree experiences more leaf damage than the north side. Two extremes are known, with leaves white underneath and with leaves brown underneath. The brown varieties are claimed to be more cold hardy than the white varieties, but this does not appear to be proven as yet. Once established, the plants are drought tolerant, and the most drought tolerant of all the &quot;Magnolia&quot; species.

The leaves are heavy and tend to fall year round from the interior of the crown and form a dense cover over the soil surface, and they have been used in decorative floral arrangements. The leaves have a waxy coating that makes them resistant to damage from salt and air pollution.

In the United States, southern magnolia, along with sweetbay (&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;) and cucumbertree (&quot;Magnolia acuminata&quot;), is commercially harvested. Lumber from all three species is simply called magnolia, which is used in the construction of furniture, boxes, pallets, venetian blinds, sashes, and doors, and used as veneers. Southern magnolia has yellowish-white sapwood and light to dark brown heartwood tinted yellow or green. The usually straight-grained wood has uniform texture with closely spaced rings. The wood is ranked moderate in heaviness, hardness, and stiffness, and moderately low in shrinkage, bending, and compression strength; it is ranked moderately high in shock resistance. Its use in the Southeastern United States has been supplanted by the availability of harder woods.

===Cultivars===
Over 150 cultivars have been developed and named, although only 30 to 40 of these still exist and still fewer are commercially propagated and sold. Most plants in nurseries are propagated by cuttings, resulting in more consistent form in the various varieties available. Many older cultivars have been superseded by newer ones and are no longer available. Some cultivars have been found to be more cold hardy, they include:

*&#x27;Bracken&#x27;s Brown Beauty&#x27; was developed by Ray Bracken of Easley, South Carolina, in the late 1960s and patented in 1985. It is a popular cultivar that has survived long-term in West Virginia, New Jersey, and Long Island, NY. This cultivar grows in a dense and compact pattern, with narrow, medium-sized, glossy leaves. Flowers measure .
*&#x27;Edith Bogue&#x27; was brought to the coastal plain of New Jersey from Florida in the 1920s. The original tree sent to Edith A. Bogue from Florida helped to establish cold-hardy specimens in the Middle Atlantic states from Delaware to coastal Connecticut. Once established, &#x27;Edith Bogue&#x27; has been known to have only minor spotting and margin burn on the leaf in temperatures as low as . With a vigorous classic pyramidal shape, this cultivar grows to 35 ft with a 15-ft spread. The leaves are large and deep green, but lack the brown indumentum on their undersides which make other cultivars so distinctive.
*&#x27;Angustifolia&#x27;, developed in France in 1825, has narrow, spear-shaped leaves long by wide, as its name suggests.
*&#x27;Exmouth&#x27; was developed in the early 18th century by John Colliton in Devon. It is notable for its huge flowers, with up to 20 petals, and vigorous growth. Erect in habit, it is often planted against walls. The leaves are green above and brownish underneath. The flowers are very fragrant and the leaves are narrow and leathery.
*&#x27;Goliath&#x27; was developed by Caledonia Nurseries of Guernsey, and has a bushier habit and globular flowers of up to diameter. Long-flowering, it has oval leaves which lack the brownish hair underneath.
*&#x27;Little Gem&#x27;, a dwarf cultivar, is grown in more moderate climates, roughly from New Jersey, Maryland and the Virginias southward. Originally developed in 1952 by Steed&#x27;s Nursery in Candor, North Carolina, it is a slower-growing form with a columnar shape which reaches around high and wide. Flowering heavily over an extended period in warmer climate, it bears medium-sized, cup-shaped flowers, and has elliptic leaves long by wide. It flowers relatively quickly after planting compared with other cultivars.
*&quot;Victoria&quot; is a form grown in the Pacific Northwest that is reportedly hardy to -12 F. It has a more open habit and shiny dark green leaves with brown undersides.

Other commonly grown cultivars include:
*&#x27;Ferruginea&#x27; has dark-green leaves with rust-brown undersides.
*&#x27;Southern Charm&#x27; is a dwarf form that grows into a bushy shrub with a pyramidal shape up to 20–25 ft high and 10 ft wide. It has dark green shiny leaves 3-6 in long and 2-4 in wide with brown undersides. It is also known as &#x27;Teddy Bear&#x27;, for the fuzzy brown undersurface of the leaves.

==Chemistry==
&quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot; contains phenolic constituents shown to possess significant antimicrobial activity. Magnolol, honokiol, and 3,5′-diallyl-2′-hydroxy-4-methoxybiphenyl exhibited significant activity against Gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria and fungi. The leaves contain coumarins and sesquiterpene lactones. The sesquiterpenes are known to be costunolide, parthenolide, costunolide diepoxide, santamarine, and reynosin.

<text>In chemistry, dialysis is the process of separating molecules in solution by the difference in their rates of diffusion through a semipermeable membrane, such as dialysis tubing.

Dialysis is a common laboratory technique that operates on the same principle as medical dialysis. In the context of life science research, the most common application of dialysis is for the removal of unwanted small molecules such as salts, reducing agents, or dyes from larger macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, or polysaccharides. Dialysis is also commonly used for buffer exchange and drug binding studies.

The concept of dialysis was introduced in 1861 by the Scottish chemist Thomas Graham. He used this technique to separate sucrose (small molecule) and gum Arabic solutes (large molecule) in aqueous solution. He called the diffusible solutes crystalloids and those that would not pass the membrane colloids.

From this concept dialysis can be defined as a spontaneous separation process of suspended colloidal particles from dissolved ions or molecules of small dimensions through a semi permeable membrane. Most common dialysis membrane are made of cellulose, modified cellulose or synthetic polymer (cellulose acetate or nitrocellulose).

==Etymology==
&quot;Dialysis&quot; derives from the Greek , &#x27;through&#x27;, and , &#x27;to loosen&#x27;.

==Principles==
Dialysis is the process used to change the matrix of molecules in a sample by differentiating molecules by the classification of size. It relies on diffusion, which is the random, thermal movement of molecules in solution (Brownian motion) that leads to the net movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to a lower concentration until equilibrium is reached. Due to the pore size of the membrane, large molecules in the sample cannot pass through the membrane, thereby restricting their diffusion from the sample chamber. By contrast, small molecules will freely diffuse across the membrane and obtain equilibrium across the entire solution volume, thereby changing the overall concentration of these molecules in the sample and dialysate (see dialysis figure at right). 

Osmosis is another principle that makes dialysis work. During osmosis, fluid moves from areas of high water concentration to lower water concentration across a semi-permeable membrane until equilibrium. In dialysis, excess fluid moves from sample to the dialysate through a membrane until the fluid level is the same between sample and dialysate.

Finally, ultrafiltration is the convective flow of water and dissolved solute down a pressure gradient caused by hydrostatic forces or osmotic forces. In dialysis, ultrafiltration removes molecules of waste and excess fluids from sample.

For example, dialysis occurs when a sample contained in a cellulose bag and is immersed into a dialysate solution. During dialysis, equilibrium is achieved between the sample and dialysate since only small molecules can pass the cellulose membrane, leaving only larger particles behind.

Once equilibrium is reached, the final concentration of molecules is dependent on the volumes of the solutions involved, and if the equilibrated dialysate is replaced (or exchanged) with fresh dialysate (see procedure below), diffusion will further reduce the concentration of the small molecules in the sample.

Dialysis can be used to either introduce or remove small molecules from a sample, because small molecules move freely across the membrane in both directions. Dialysis can also be used to remove salts. This makes dialysis a useful technique for a variety of applications. See dialysis tubing for additional information on the history, properties, and manufacturing of semipermeable membranes used for dialysis.

== Types ==

=== Diffusion dialysis ===
Diffusion dialysis is a spontaneous separation process where the driving force which produces the separation is the concentration gradient. It has an increase in entropy and decrease in Gibbs free energy which means that it is thermodynamically favorable. Diffusion dialysis uses anion exchange membranes (AEM) or cation exchange membranes (CEM) depending on the compounds to separate. AEM allows the passage of anions while it obstructs the passage of cations due to the co-ion rejection and preservation of electrical neutrality. The opposite happens with cation exchange membranes.

=== Electrodialysis ===
Electrodialysis is a process of separation which uses ion-exchange membranes and an electrical potential as a driving force. It is mainly used to remove ions from aqueous solutions. There are three electrodialysis processes which are commonly used - Donnan dialysis, reverse electrodialysis, and electro-electrodialysis. These processes are explained below.

==== Donnan dialysis ====
Donnan dialysis is a separation process which is used to exchange ions between two aqueous solutions which are separated by a CEM or an AEM membrane. In the case of a cation exchange membrane separating two solutions with different acidity, protons (H+) go through the membrane to the less acidic side. This induces an electrical potential that will instigate a flux of the cations present in the less acidic side to the more acidic side. The process will finish when the variation of concentration of H+ is the same order of magnitude as the difference of concentration of the separated cation.

==== Reverse electrodialysis ====
Reverse electrodialysis is a technology based on membranes which gets electricity from a mixing of two water streams with different salinities. It commonly uses anion exchange membranes (AEM) and cation exchange membranes (CEM). AEMs are used to allow the pass of anions and obstruct the pass of cations and CEMs are used to do the opposite. The cations and anions in the high salinity water moves to the low salinity water, cations passing through the CEMs and anions through the AEMs. This phenomenon can be converted to electricity.

==== Electro-electrodialysis ====
Electro-electrodialysis is an electromembrane process utilizing three compartments, which combines electrodialysis and electrolysis. It is commonly used to recover acid from a solution using AEM, CEM and electrolysis. The three compartments are separated by two barriers, which are the ion exchange membranes. The compartment in the middle has the water to be treated. The compartments located on the sides contain clean water. The anions pass through the AEM, while the cations pass through the CEM. The electricity creates H+ in the anions&#x27; side and OH− in the cations&#x27; side, which react with the respective ions.

==Procedure==

===Equipment===

Separating molecules in a solution by dialysis is a relatively straightforward process. Other than the sample and dialysate buffer, all that is typically needed is: 
* Dialysis membrane in an appropriate format (e.g., tubing, cassette, etc.) and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO)
* A container to hold the dialysate buffer
* The ability to stir the solutions and control the temperature

===General protocol===
A typical dialysis procedure for protein samples is as follows: 
# Prepare the membrane according to instructions
# Load the sample into dialysis tubing, cassette or device
# Place sample into an external chamber of dialysis buffer (with gentle stirring of the buffer)
# Dialyze for 2 hours (at room temperature or 4 °C)
# Change the dialysis buffer and dialyze for another 2 hours
# Change the dialysis buffer and dialyze for 2 hours or overnight

The total volume of sample and dialysate determine the final equilibrium concentration of the small molecules on both sides of the membrane. By using the appropriate volume of dialysate and multiple exchanges of the buffer, the concentration of small contaminants within the sample can be decreased to acceptable or negligible levels. 
For example, when dialyzing 1mL of sample against 200mL of dialysate, the concentration of unwanted dialyzable substances will be decreased 200-fold when equilibrium is attained. Following two additional buffer changes of 200mL each, the contaminant level in the sample will be reduced by a factor of 8 x 106 (200 x 200 x 200).

===Variables and protocol optimization===
Although dialyzing a sample is relatively simple, a universal dialysis procedure for all applications cannot be provided due to the following variables:
* The sample volume
* The size of the molecules being separated
* The membrane used 
* The geometry of the membrane, which affects the diffusion distance

Additionally, the dialysis endpoint is somewhat subjective and application specific. Therefore, the general procedure might require optimization.

==Dialysis membranes and MWCO==

Dialysis membranes are produced and characterized according to molecular-weight cutoff (MWCO) limits. While membranes with MWCOs ranging from 1-1,000,000 kDa are commercially available, membranes with MWCOs near 10 kDa are most commonly used. The MWCO of a membrane is the result of the number and average size of the pores created during production of the dialysis membrane. The MWCO typically refers to the smallest average molecular mass of a standard molecule that will not effectively diffuse across the membrane during extended dialysis. Thus, a dialysis membrane with a 10K MWCO will generally retain greater than 90% of a protein having a molecular mass of at least 10kDa.

It is important to note that the MWCO of a membrane is not a sharply defined value. Molecules with mass near the MWCO limit of the membrane will diffuse across the membrane more slowly than molecules significantly smaller than the MWCO. In order for a molecule to rapidly diffuse across a membrane, it typically needs to be at least 20- to 50-times smaller than the MWCO rating of a membrane. Therefore, it is not practical to separate a 30kDa protein from a 10kDa protein using dialysis across a 20K rated dialysis membrane.

Dialysis membranes for laboratory use are typically made of a film of regenerated cellulose or cellulose esters. See reference for a review of cellulose membranes and manufacturing.

== Laboratory dialysis formats==

Dialysis is generally performed in clipped bags of dialysis tubing or in a variety of formatted dialyzers. The choice of the dialysis set up used is largely dependent on the size of the sample and the preference of the user.
Dialysis tubing is the oldest and generally the least expensive format used for dialysis in the lab. Tubing is cut and sealed with a clip at one end, then filled and sealed with a clip on the other end. Tubing provides flexibility but has increased concerns regarding handling, sealing and sample recovery. Dialysis tubing is typically supplied either wet or dry in rolls or pleated telescoped tubes.

A wide variety of dialysis devices (or dialyzers) are available from several vendors. Dialyzers are designed for specific sample volume ranges and provide greater sample security and improved ease of use and performance for dialysis experiments over tubing. The most common preformatted dialyzers are Slide-A-Lyzer, Float-A-Lyzer, and the Pur-A-lyzer/D-Tube/GeBAflex Dialyzers product lines.

== Applications ==
Dialysis has a wide range of applications. These can be divided into two categories depending on the type of dialysis used.

=== Diffusion dialysis ===
Some applications of the diffusion dialysis are explained below.

*Strong aqueous caustic soda solutions can be purified of hemicellulose by diffusion dialysis. This is specific to the largely-obsolete viscose process. The first step in that process is to treat almost-pure cellulose (cotton linters or dissolving pulp) with strong (17-20% w/w) solutions of sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) in water. One effect of that step is to dissolve the hemicelluloses (low-MW polymers). In some circumstances, it is desirable to remove as much hemicellulose as possible out of the process, and that can be done using dialysis.
* Acids can be recovered from aqueous solutions using anion-exchange membranes. That process is an alternative treatment of industrial wastewater. It is used for the recovery of mixed acid (HF+ HNO3), the recovery and concentration of Zn2+ and Cu2+, in H2SO4+ CuSO4 and H2SO4+ ZnSO4 and the recovery of H2SO4 from waste sulphuric acid solutions containing Fe and Ni ions, which are produced at the diamond manufacturing process.
* Alkali waste can be recovered using diffusion dialysis because of its low energy cost. The NaOH base can be recovered from the aluminium etching solution applying a technique develop by Astom Corporation of Japan.
* De-alcoholisation of beer is another application of the diffusion dialysis. Taking into account that a concentration gradient is applied for this technique, the alcohol and other small molecule compounds transfer across the membrane from higher concentrations to lower, which is water. It is used for this application for the low operation conditions and the possibility to remove alcohol to 0.5%.

=== Electrodialysis ===
Some applications of the electrodialysis are explained below.

* The desalination of whey is the largest area of use for this type of dialysis in the food industry. It is necessary to remove crude cheese whey containing calcium, phosphorus and other inorganic salts to produce different foods such as cake, bread, ice cream and baby foods. The limit of whey demineralisation is almost 90%.
* De-acidification of fruit juice such as grape, orange, apple and lemon are processes in which electrodialysis is applied. An anion-exchange membrane is employed in this technique implying that citrate ions from the juice are extracted and replaced by hydroxide ions.
* Desalting of soy sauce can be done by electrodialysis. The conventional values of salt in brewed soy sauce are about 16-18 %, which is a quite high content. Electrodialysis is used to reduce the amount of salt present in the soy sauce. Nowadays diets of low salt content are very present in the society.
* Electrodialysis allows the separation of amino acids into acidic, basic and neutral groups. Specifically, cytoplasmic leaf proteins are extracted from alfalfa leaves applying electrodialysis. When proteins are denatured, the solutions can be desalted (of K+ ions) and acidified with H+ ions.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Dialysis has both advantages and disadvantages. Following the structure of the previous section, the pros and cons are discussed based on the type of dialysis used. Advantages and drawbacks of both, diffusion dialysis and electrodialysis, are outlined below.

=== Diffusion dialysis ===
The main advantage of diffusion dialysis is the low energy consumption of the unit. This membrane technique operates under normal pressure and does not have a state change. Consequently, the energy required is significantly reduced, which reduces the operating cost. There is also the low installation cost, easy operation and the stability and reliability of the process. Another advantage is that diffusion dialysis does not pollute the environment.

A disadvantage is that a diffusion dialyser has a low processing capability and low processing efficiency. There are other methods such as electrodialysis and reverse osmosis that can achieve better efficiencies than diffusion dialysis.

=== Electrodialysis ===
The main benefit of electrodialysis is the high recovery, especially in the water recovery. Another advantage is the fact that not high pressure is applied which implies that the effect fouling is not significant and consequently no chemicals are required to fight against them. Moreover, the fouling layer is not compact which leads to a higher recovery and to a long membrane life. It is also important that the treatments are for concentrations higher than 70,000 ppm eliminating the concentration limit. Finally, the energy required to operate is low due to the non-phase change. In fact, it is lower in comparison with the needed in the multi effect distillation (MED) and mechanical vapour compression (MVC) processes.

The main drawback of electrodialysis is the current density limit, the process must be operated at a lower current density than the maximum allowed. The fact is that at certain voltage applied the diffusion of ions through the membrane are not linear leading to water dissociation, which would reduce the efficiency of the operation. Another aspect to take into account is that although low energy is required to operate, the higher the salt feed concentration is, the higher the energy needed will be. Finally, in the case of some products, it must be considered that electrodialysis does not remove microorganisms and organic contaminants, therefore a post-treatment is necessary.

<text>Smeerenburg was a whaling settlement on Amsterdam Island in northwest Svalbard. It was founded by the Danish and Dutch in 1619 as one of Europe&#x27;s northernmost outposts. With the local bowhead whale population soon decimated and whaling developed into a industry, Smeerenburg was abandoned around 1660.

==History==

During the first intensive phase of the Spitsbergen whale fishery, Smeerenburg served as the centre of operations in the north. The name &quot;Smeerenburg&quot; is a Dutch word literally meaning &quot;blubber town&quot;. The whalers were taking the &quot;Greenland right whale&quot;, now known as the bowhead whale, which were then prevalent in Fram Strait. At that time, oil was rendered from whale blubber using try pots on shore, rather than on ships at sea, so the whalers needed a shore station for the try works. The image at right shows the concretised remnants of whale oil that built up around the large (ca. 2-3m diameter) copper kettles in which the blubber was rendered. Leftover blubber was used as fuel for the fires.

The site of Smeerenburg was first occupied by the Dutch in 1614, when ships from the Amsterdam chamber of the &quot;Noordsche Compagnie&quot; (Northern Company) established a temporary whaling station here with tents made of canvas and crude, temporary ovens. In 1615, 1616, and 1618 the Dutch again occupied the site. In 1619, a 500-ton ship with timber and other materials was sent to Spitsbergen. The tents and temporary ovens were replaced with wooden structures and copper kettles &quot;set in a permanent fashion on a brick foundation, with a brick fireplace beneath and a chimney for the smoke.&quot;

In its first year only Amsterdam and the Danes occupied Smeerenburg, the former to the east and the latter to the west. In 1619 and 1620 the Danish ships that went to Smeerenburg were sent by merchants from Copenhagen, while those that went there in 1621 and 1622 were sent by a royal undertaking. In 1623 two Basque ships employed by the Danes arrived at Smeerenburg and began taking whaling gear from the Danish huts before they were driven away by the Dutch. In 1625, when the Danish-employed Basque ships arrived at their place in Smeerenburg they found that their station had been damaged, the work of the Dutch and English in the previous season. After 1625 the Danes were expelled by the Dutch, their place being occupied by the Hoorn, Enkhuizen, and Vlissingen chambers. By 1626 there were five big &quot;huts&quot; at Smeerenburg, and by 1633 all the chambers of the Northern Company were represented at the settlement.

In its heyday (1630s), Smeerenburg was made up of 16–17 buildings, including a fort at its centre, built in or before 1631 to ward off the Danish and other interlopers. The alleys between the buildings were cobbled with drainage gullies, allowing the men to walk dry-shod. There were seven double (and one single) ovens situated in front of the buildings. Amsterdam had three of the buildings and two of the double ovens, while to the west were the stations of the Middelburg, Veere, Vlissingen, Enkhuizen, Delft, and Hoorn chambers. During this time there were as many as 200 men working ashore, boiling blubber into oil, flensing whales, and coopering casks to pour the oil into.

Following the destruction of a Dutch station in Jan Mayen by Danish-employed Basque ships in 1632, the Dutch sent seven men, led by Jacob Segerszoon van der Brugge, to over-winter at Smeerenburg in 1633–34. All seven men survived, prompting another wintering by another group of seven sailors in 1634–35. All of them died, and the experiment was abandoned.

Smeerenburg&#x27;s decline began in the early to mid-1640s, as whales became scarce in the bays and sounds off Spitsbergen. We hear of it still in use by the Hoorn chamber as late as 1657. Around 1660, with the transition to processing blubber into oil on return to port and expansion into pelagic whaling, the settlement was finally abandoned.

In 1973 the ruins of Smeerenburg became part of Norway&#x27;s North-West Spitsbergen National Park.

== Myth ==
The size of Smeerenburg has been greatly exaggerated by many authors. William Scoresby (1820) claimed 200 to 300 ships and 12,000 to 18,000 men visited Smeerenburg during the short summer season. The Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen (1920) made similar claims, stating that hundreds of ships anchored along the flat of Smeerenburg where ten thousand people visited a complete town with stalls and streets. Besides the tryworks, smithies and workshops, there were shops, churches, fortifications, gambling dens and even brothels.

Such claims have no basis in reality, as noted above. No more than fifteen ships and 400 men would have visited Smeerenburg during its peak in the 1630s. There were no shops, churches or brothels, though there was a single fort with two guns. Despite the results of archaeological excavations that took place in the period 1979–81, modern authors still sometimes repeat the fabulous legends told of Smeerenburg.

The 2019 animated film &quot;Klaus&quot; takes place in the town of &quot;Smeerensburg&quot;, on a distant northern Scandinavian island, an intentional misspelling, according to producer Sergio Pablos.

<doc id="496297" wikidata="Q2630359" url="?curid=496297" title="Spheroplast">
<text>A spheroplast (or sphaeroplast in British usage) is a microbial cell from which the cell wall has been almost completely removed, as by the action of penicillin or lysozyme. According to some definitions, the term is used to describe Gram-negative bacteria. According to other definitions, the term also encompasses yeasts. The name spheroplast stems from the fact that after the microbe&#x27;s cell wall is digested, membrane tension causes the cell to acquire a characteristic spherical shape. Spheroplasts are osmotically fragile, and will lyse if transferred to a hypotonic solution.

When used to describe Gram-negative bacteria, the term spheroplast refers to cells from which the peptidoglycan component but not the outer membrane component of the cell wall has been removed.

==Spheroplast formation==
===Antibiotic-induced spheroplasts===
Various antibiotics convert Gram-negative bacteria into spheroplasts. These include peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors such as fosfomycin, vancomycin, moenomycin, lactivicin and the β-lactam antibiotics. Antibiotics that inhibit biochemical pathways directly upstream of peptidoglycan synthesis induce spheroplasts too (e.g. fosmidomycin, phosphoenolpyruvate).

In addition to the above antibiotics, inhibitors of protein synthesis (e.g. chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline, several aminoglycosides) and inhibitors of folic acid synthesis (e.g. trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole) also cause Gram-negative bacteria to form spheroplasts.

===Enzyme-induced spheroplasts===
The enzyme lysozyme causes Gram-negative bacteria to form spheroplasts, but only if a membrane permeabilizer such as lactoferrin or ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) is used to ease the enzyme&#x27;s passage through the outer membrane. EDTA acts as a permeabilizer by binding to divalent ions such as Ca2+ and removing them from the outer membrane.

The yeast &quot;Candida albicans&quot; can be converted to spheroplasts using the enzymes lyticase, chitinase and β-glucuronidase.

==Uses and applications==
===Antibiotic discovery===
From the 1960s into the 1990s, Merck and Co. used a spheroplast screen as a primary method for discovery of antibiotics that inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. In this screen devised by Eugene Dulaney, growing bacteria were exposed to test substances under hypertonic conditions. Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis caused growing bacteria to form spheroplasts. This screen enabled the discovery of fosfomycin, cephamycin C, thienamycin and several carbapenems.

=== Patch clamping ===
Specially prepared giant spheroplasts of Gram-negative bacteria can be used to study the function of bacterial ion channels through a technique called patch clamp, which was originally designed for characterizing the behavior of neurons and other excitable cells. To prepare giant spheroplasts, bacteria are treated with a septation inhibitor (e.g. cephalexin). This causes the bacteria to form filaments, elongated cells that lack internal cross-walls. After a period of time, the cell walls of the filaments are digested, and the bacteria collapse into very large spheres surrounded by just their cytoplasmic and outer membranes. The membranes can then be analyzed on a patch clamp apparatus to determine the phenotype of the ion channels embedded in it. It is also common to overexpress a particular channel to amplify its effect and make it easier to characterize.

The technique of patch clamping giant &quot;E. coli&quot; spheroplasts has been used to study the native mechanosensitive channels (MscL, MscS, and MscM) of &quot;E. coli&quot;. It has been extended to study other heterologously expressed ion channels and it has been shown that the giant &quot;E. coli&quot; spheroplast can be used as an ion-channel expression system comparable to the &quot;Xenopus&quot; oocyte.

=== Cell lysis ===
Yeast cells are normally protected by a thick cell wall which makes extraction of cellular proteins difficult. Enzymatic digestion of the cell wall with zymolyase, creating spheroplasts, renders the cells vulnerable to easy lysis with detergents or rapid osmolar pressure changes.

=== Transfection ===
Bacterial spheroplasts, with suitable recombinant DNA inserted into them, can be used to transfect animal cells. Spheroplasts with recombinant DNA are introduced into the media containing animal cells and are fused by polyethylene glycol (PEG). With this method, nearly 100% of the animal cells may take up the foreign DNA. Upon conducting experiments following a modified Hanahan protocol using calcium chloride in &quot;E. coli&quot;, it was determined that spheroplasts may be able to transform at 4.9x10−4.

<doc id="496303" wikidata="Q5891712" url="?curid=496303" title="Homosexuality and Quakerism">
<text>The views of Quakers around the world towards homosexuality encompass a range from complete celebration and the practice of same-sex marriage, to the view that homosexuality is sinfully deviant and contrary to God&#x27;s intentions for sexual expression. The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) is a historically Christian religious movement founded in 17th-century England; it has around 350,000 members. In Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, many Quakers are supportive of homosexual relationships, while views are divided among U.S. meetings. Many Conservative Friends and Holiness Friends, both of which have retained traditional Quaker practices such as plain dress, along with Evangelical Friends, view homosexual acts as sinful. 49% of Quakers live in Africa, and though views may differ, the Kenyan Church of Friends does not support homosexual relationships.

== Friends&#x27; policy and decision-making ==
Since Quaker decision making is generally based on seeking &quot;unity&quot; at the level of a Monthly meeting (convened periodically for business, and more often for worship, and is the basic unit of Quakerism – a meeting is equivalent to a single congregation, sometimes to a parish or group of churches in an area), determining a particular Quaker attitude is difficult on this or any topic. Monthly meetings are organized into larger groups such as Yearly meetings or other &quot;umbrella&quot; groups, but often these larger groups have conflicting stances on particular issues. Some groups, for example the 57th Street Meeting in Chicago, may have joint membership in umbrella groups that have mutually contradictory stances on the issues. In the end, the true &quot;Quaker view&quot; on homosexuality is probably best analysed meeting by meeting (or, better, Friend by Friend). However, there are some general patterns, and for reasons of space and completeness this article deals mainly with the largest organizations on a country-by-country basis. Until the 1960s the topic of homosexuality was untouched among Quakers. London Yearly Meeting&#x27;s publication of &quot;Towards a Quaker View of Sex&quot;, including norms for sexual relations that were inclusive of equitable same-sex relations, provoked on-going questioning. By the time the first same-sex relationship was taken under the care of a Friends meeting in 1982 (University MM, North Pacific Yearly Meeting, Seattle, Washington) the scene was set for ongoing discernment and disagreement.

Quakers as a whole do not have a specific, set creed. The Richmond Declaration is a confession of faith that expresses the experience of two branches of American Quakerism, but does not reflect the views of others.

== By region ==

===Oceania===

====Australia====
Quakers in Australia are overwhelmingly accepting of homosexuality and will celebrate same sex marriages as they would an opposite sex marriage. In 1975 Australia Yearly Meeting officially stated:

The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Australia calls for a change in the laws ... to eliminate discrimination against homosexuals. This statement is made in the light of the Society&#x27;s desire to remove discrimination and persecution in the community. The Society also calls on all people to seek more knowledge and understanding of the diversity of human relationships and to affirm the worth of love in all of them.

Australian Quakers have supported the celebration of same sex and different sex commitment ceremonies since 1994 and recognize them on an equal basis with other committed and loving relationships. In January 2010, Quakers meeting in Australia Yearly Meeting in Adelaide agreed to treat all requests for marriages in accordance with Quaker traditions, regardless of the sexual orientation or gender of the partners. Before this Australia-wide decision, Canberra Regional Meeting celebrated the first same sex marriage among Australian Quakers on 15 April 2007.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, the yearly meeting Te Hāhi Tūhauwiri, in 1992, resolved &quot;to seek formal ways of recognizing a variety of commitments, including gay and lesbian partnerships&quot;.

===Europe===
====Ireland====
Ireland Yearly Meeting, which includes meetings in Northern Ireland, permits same-sex marriages to take place within their meetings. However, no individual Friend or Meeting is required to take part in these marriages if it offends their conscience.

====United Kingdom====

Britain Yearly Meeting formally minuted support for same-sex marriage in 2009 and began to centrally lobby the government for the necessary legal changes. The decision was taken 22 years after being first raised at Meeting for Sufferings, and 46 years after the publication of &quot;Towards a Quaker View of Sex&quot;. Controversial in its day, the book forms one of the first Quaker statements regarding sexuality, and includes affirmation that gender or sexual orientation are unimportant in a judgement of an intimate relationship and that the true criterion is the presence of &quot;selfless love&quot;; further consideration arose from Harvey Gillman&#x27;s Swarthmore Lecture, in 1988.

Before the legalisation of same-sex marriage, some Friends (both opposite-sex and same-sex) celebrated their relationships in a Meeting for Worship with a Celebration of Commitment. Britain Yearly Meeting supported the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, which legalised secular and religious same-sex marriages in England and Wales.

===North America===

====United States ====
Quakers in the United States are divided on the issue of homosexuality, with some (mostly Friends affiliated with programmed meetings) not approving of either homosexuality or the legalization of same sex unions. Friends associated with Friends General Conference (FGC), the more liberal group of Friends encompassing a large number of yearly meetings and approximately a fifth of all Quakers in the country, are the most tolerant with many monthly meetings and some yearly meetings providing full equality for homosexuals including marriage. FGC itself in 2004 made a statement on including LGBT quakers as equals in worship and acknowledging their past contributions to the conference. The largely FGC-based FLGBTQC (Friends for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Concerns) group holds meetings twice a year.

Similar positions from other unprogrammed Quaker meetings not affiliated with FGC include that taken by North Pacific Yearly Meeting and Pacific Yearly Meeting, which support same-sex marriage.

On the other hand, Friends associated with the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends (CYMF), Friends United Meeting (FUM) and Evangelical Friends Church International (EFCI), which represent mostly programmed Quaker meetings, have taken stands condemning gay marriage and homosexual relationships altogether. Indiana and Western Yearly Meetings (members of FUM) issued a statement of &quot;core values&quot; which includes both an insistence on abstinence outside of marriage, and a definition of marriage to heterosexual relationships only, as does the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends in its &quot;Manual of Faith and Practice&quot;. Evangelical Friends Church - Southwest, a yearly meeting and a member of EFI, states in its &quot;Faith and Practice&quot; that homosexuality is a sin and grounds for termination of employment in the church.

However, there is dissension within the Evangelical groups. The Friends of Jesus Community, some of whose members were affiliated with EFCI, took a public stance in favor of the equal worth of same-sex relationships. In Northwest Yearly Meeting of Friends Church (NWYM), associated with EFCI, one Portland-area Monthly Meeting has minuted its support of same-sex unions, creating a discussion on their statement of human sexuality. This led to a number of other NWYM churches discussing this matter, leading some of them to form a new yearly meeting, and at least one of them to split.

Most monthly meetings of Baltimore Yearly Meeting (BYM, a member of both FGC and FUM) have taken a similar position. Similarly, although perhaps to a lesser extent, some meetings associated with groups on the other side of the issue have dissented. Swansea Monthly Meeting, under care of New England Yearly Meeting, is one of two meetings in that group to publicly oppose same-sex marriage.

In 2002, FUM and BYM began a dialogue on homosexuality and same-sex relationships. At the 2002 FUM Triennial, Clerk Lamar Matthew was excluded from leading a worship sharing group because he was in a relationship with another man. FUM has affirmed in a minute of its General Board that its policy that anyone in sexual relationships outside of marriage – &quot;which is understood to be between one man and one woman&quot; – cannot be in paid leadership positions (a minute approved in 1988) also applies to those in other leadership positions and to their overseas workers. Since that time, BYM has had a program of intervisitation with other Yearly Meetings on the issue of same-sex relationships. This policy of FUM has been in constant discussion in the FUM board ever since it was originally proposed. BYM is not the only dual-membership Yearly Meeting (membership in both FUM and FGC). Many members of the New England and New York Yearly Meetings have also been struggling with the FUM position.

==== Canada ====
In Canada, the main &quot;umbrella&quot; Quaker body, Canadian Yearly Meeting, shares a similar view to the more liberal American Quaker groups, and stated in 2003 that Canadian Quakers &quot;support the right of same-sex couples to a civil marriage and the extension of the legal definition of marriage to include same-sex couples.&quot; Since then a number of same-sex marriages have been performed at Canadian Monthly Meetings. CYM is a member of both FUM and FGC. As a result of FUM&#x27;s position on homosexuality, there is ongoing debate within Canadian Yearly Meeting about CYM&#x27;s relationship with FUM. Canadian Yearly Meeting in 2007 approved a letter to be sent to FUM stating that CYM has appointed a committee &quot;to review the involvement and participation of CYM in FUM&quot;. In the meantime, CYM&#x27;s financial contribution was earmarked for a specific purpose.

=== In other countries===
The majority of Quakers live in countries not mentioned above. Kenya, for example, has a Quaker population larger than that of any other country. The Friends Church in Kenya &quot;condemns homosexuality&quot;.

Generally in Africa and Latin America, most meetings are programmed and under the care of either FUM or EFI although meetings in Central and Southern Africa are unprogrammed; in Asia, many of the meetings are unprogrammed and have connections with more liberal groups elsewhere in the world.

African Friends in general are supportive of the position taken by FUM. In 2007, at the first meeting of FUM held in Africa, the clerk of Uganda Yearly Meeting delivered a devotional in which he quoted Romans 1:8–32, saying that &quot;homosexuals and even those who support them are worthy of death.&quot; Although in a later letter of apology he said that he was referring to spiritual death, many more liberal Quakers found his comments hateful.

<doc id="496305" wikidata="Q420690" url="?curid=496305" title="Deoxyribonuclease">
<text>Deoxyribonuclease (DNase, for short) refers to a group of glycoprotein endonucleases which are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone, thus degrading DNA. The role of the DNase enzyme in cells includes breaking down extracellular DNA (ecDNA) excreted by apoptosis, necrosis, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) of cells to help reduce inflammatory responses that otherwise are elicited. A wide variety of deoxyribonucleases are known and fall into one of two families (DNase I or DNase II), which differ in their substrate specificities, chemical mechanisms, and biological functions. Laboratory applications of DNase include purifying proteins when extracted from prokaryotic organisms. Additionally, DNase has been applied as a treatment for diseases that are caused by ecDNA in the blood plasma. Assays of DNase are emerging in the research field as well.

== Types ==
The two main types of DNase found in animals are known as deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II). These two families have subcategories within them.

=== The DNase I Family: DNase I, DNase1L1, DNase 1L2, DNase1L3 ===
The first set of DNases is DNase I. This family consisted of DNase I, DNase1L1, DNase 1L2, and DNase1L3. DNase I cleaves DNA to form two oligonucleotide-end products with 5’-phospho and 3’-hydroxy ends and is produced mainly by organs of the digestive system. The DNase I family requires Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations as activators and selectively expressed. In terms of pH, the DNAses I family is active in normal pH of around 6.5 to 8.

=== The DNase II Family: DNase II α and DNase II β ===
The second set of DNAases is DNase II. This family consisted of DNase II α and DNase II β. Like DNAase I, DNAase II cleaves DNA to form two oligonucleotide-end products with 5’-hydroxy and 3’-phospho ends. This type of DNAase is more widely expressed in tissues due to high expression in macrophages but limited cell-type expression. Unlike DNAase I, they do not need Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations as activators. In terms of pH, the DNAase II family is expressed in acidic pH. The cleavage pattern of DNase II is altered in the presence of Dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO), which significantly affects the structure of DNA.

== Structure ==
Although both DNase I and II are glycoprotein endonucleases, DNase I has a monomeric sandwich-type structure with a carbohydrate side chain whereas DNase II has a dimeric quaternary structure. DNase I Structure: DNase I is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 30,000 Da and a carbohydrate chain of 8-10 residues attached to Asn18 (orange). It is an 𝛼,𝛽-protein with two 6-stranded 𝛽-pleated sheets which form the core of the structure. These two core sheets run parallel, and all others run antiparallel. The 𝛽-pleated sheets lie in the center of the structure while the 𝛼-helices are denoted by the coils on the periphery. DNase I contains four ion-binding pockets, and requires Ca2+ and Mg2+ for hydrolyzing double-stranded DNA. Two of the sites strongly bind Ca2+ while the other two coordinate Mg2+. Little has been published on the number and location of the Mg2+ binding sites, although it has been proposed that Mg2+ is located near the catalytic pocket and contributes to hydrolysis. The two Ca2+ are shown in red in the image. They are bound to DNase I under crystallization conditions and are important for the structural integrity of the molecule by stabilizing the surface loop Asp198 to Thr204 (cyan), and by limiting the region of high thermal mobility in the flexible loop to residues Gly97 to Gly102 (yellow).
DNase II Structure: DNase II contains a homodimeric quaternary structure that is capable of binding double-stranded DNA within a U-shaped clamp architecture. The interior of the U-shaped clamp is largely electropositive, capable of binding negatively-charged DNA. Similar to DNase I, DNase II structure consists of a mixed 𝛼/𝛽 secondary structure with 9 𝛼-helices and 20 𝛽-pleated sheets. Although unlike DNase I, DNase II does not require divalent metal ions for catalysis. The structure consists of protomer A (cyan) and protomer B (green). Each structure consists of two catalytic motifs, which are labeled on protomer B for simplicity: His100 and Lys102 compose the first motif (blue) and His279 and Lys281 compose the second catalytic motif (red). 
== Mechanism ==
Some DNases cut, or &quot;cleave&quot;, only residues at the ends of DNA molecules. This type of exonuclease is known as exodeoxyribonucleases. Others cleave anywhere along the chain, known as endodeoxyribonucleases (a subset of endonucleases.)
Some DNases are fairly indiscriminate about the DNA sequence at which they cut, while others, including restriction enzymes, are very sequence-specific. Other DNases cleave only double-stranded DNA, others are specific for single-stranded molecules, and others are active toward both.

The action of DNase occurs in three phases. The initial phase introduces multiple nicks in the phosphodiester backbone. The second phase produces acid-soluble nucleotides. The third phase, which is the terminal phase, consists of reduction of oligonucleotides, causing a hyperchromic shift in the UV data.

=== DNase I Mechanism ===
DNase I predominantly targets double-stranded DNA, and to a lesser extent, some single-stranded DNA for cleavage. DNase I catalyzes nonspecific DNA cleavage by nicking phosphodiester linkages in one of the strands. Its cleavage site lies between the 3′-oxygen atom and the adjacent phosphorus atom, yielding 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphoryl oligonucleotides with inversion of configuration at the phosphorus. The DNase enzyme relies on the presence of a divalent cation, which is usually Ca2+, for proper function. The active site of DNase I includes two histidine residues (His134 and His252) and two acidic residues (Glu78 and Asp 212), all of which are critical for the general acid-base catalysis of phosphodiester bonds.

=== DNase II Mechanism ===
Deoxyribonuclease II (DNase II) is also known as acid deoxyribonuclease because it has optimal activity in the low pH environment of lysosomes where it is typically found in higher eukaryotes. Some forms of recombinant DNase II display a high level of activity in low pH in the absence of divalent metal ions, similar to eukaryotic DNase II. Unlike DNase I, DNase II cleaves the phosphodiester bond between the 5&#x27;-oxygen atom and the adjacent phosphorus atom, yielding 3΄-phosphorylated and 5΄-hydroxyl nucleotides.

== Applications ==

=== Laboratory applications ===
DNase is commonly used when purifying proteins that are extracted from prokaryotic organisms. Protein extraction often involves the degradation of the cell membrane. It is common for the degraded and fragile cell membrane to be lysed, releasing unwanted DNA and the desired proteins. The resulting DNA-protein extract is highly viscous and difficult to purify, in which case DNase is added to break it down. The DNA is hydrolyzed but the proteins are unaffected and the extract can undergo further purification.

=== Treatment ===
Extracellular DNA (ecDNA) is DNA that is found in blood circulation. It appears as a result of apoptosis, necrosis, or neutrophil extracellular traps (NET)-osis of blood and tissue cells, but can also arise from the active secretion from living cells. EcDNA and their designated DNA binding proteins are able to activate DNA-sensing receptors, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are able to stimulate pathways that cause an inflammatory immune response. As a result, several studies of inflammatory diseases have found that there are high concentrations of ecDNA in blood plasma. For this reason, DNase has proven to be a possible treatment for the reduction of ecDNA in the blood plasma. DNases can be excreted both intracellularly and extracellularly and can cleave the DNA phosphodiester bond. This function can be used to maintain a low ecDNA concentration, therefore treating inflammation. Illnesses that result from DNA residue in blood have been targeted using the &quot;breaking-down properties&quot; of DNase. Studies have shown DNase to be able to act as a treatment by decreasing the viscosity of mucus. Administration of DNase varies dependent on the disease. It can and has been administered orally, intrapleurally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, and via inhalation. Several studies continue to examine the application of DNase as treatment as well as ways to monitor health. For example, recently, DNase derived from pathogenic bacteria has been used as an indicator for wound infection monitoring.

==== Respiratory diseases ====
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the production of mucus, sweat, and digestive fluids, causing them to become more viscous rather than lubricant. DNase enzymes can be inhaled using a nebulizer by cystic fibrosis sufferers. DNase enzymes help because white blood cells accumulate in the mucus, and, when they break down, they release DNA, which adds to the &#x27;stickiness&#x27; of the mucus. DNase enzymes break down the DNA, and the mucus is much easier to clear from the lungs. Specifically, DNase I, also known as FDA approved drug Pulmozyme (also known as dornase alfa) is used as a treatment to increase pulmonary function.

Other respiratory illness such as asthma, pleural empyema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have also been found to be positively affected by DNases properties.

Furthermore, recent studies show that intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a protein that is responsible for the breakdown of blood clots, combined with deoxyribonuclease increase pleural drainage, decreases hospital length of stay, and decreases the need for surgery in parapneumonic effusions and empyema.

==== Other diseases ====
Sepsis is a life-threatening inflammatory disease caused by the body&#x27;s extreme response to an infection. The body begins to attack itself as an inflammatory response encompasses the human body. As a result, high levels of ecDNA have been associated with the bloodstream and therefore, researchers have looked to DNase as an appropriate treatment. Studies have shown that DNase was successful in disrupting NETs and decreasing inflammatory responses. More research on the type and time of administration is needed to further establish DNase as an official treatment.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that results in auto-antibody generation causing inflammation that results in damage to organs, joints, and kidneys. SLE has been linked with low levels of DNase I as apoptotic cells become self-antigens in this disease. DNase I has been investigated as a possible treatment to decrease the amount of apoptotic debris in the human system. It has been suggested that their difficulty might be due to the inability for the enzyme to break down the cell membrane of chromatin. Studies have shown conflicting results on this treatment, however, further research is being conducted to examine the therapeutic benefits of DNase I.

Anti-tumor treatment. DNase is known to hold anti-tumor effects due to its ability to break down DNA. High levels of DNA are found to be in cancer patients&#x27; blood, suggesting that DNase I might be a possible treatment. There is still a lack of understanding as to why there are such high levels of ecDNA and whether or not DNase will act as an effective treatment. Several mice studies have shown positive results in anti-tumor progression utilizing intravenous DNase I. However, more investigations need to be carried out before being introduced to the public.

== Assays ==
DNA absorbs ultraviolet (UV) light with a wavelength of maximal absorbance near 260 nm. This absorption is due to the pi electrons in the aromatic bases of the DNA. In dsDNA, or even regions of RNA where double-stranded structure occurs, the bases are stacked parallel to each other, and the overlap of the base molecular orbitals leads to a decrease in absorbance of UV light. This phenomenon is called the hypochromic effect. When DNase liberates nucleotides from dsDNA, the bases are no longer stacked as they are in dsDNA, so that orbital overlap is minimized and UV absorbance increases. This increase in absorbance underlies the basis of the Kunitz unit of DNase activity. One Kunitz unit is defined as the amount of enzyme added to 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA that causes an increase in absorbance of 0.001 per minute at the wavelength of 260 nm when acting upon highly polymerized DNA at 25 °C in a 0.1 M NaOAc (pH 5.0) buffer. The unit&#x27;s name recognizes the Russian-American biochemist Moses Kunitz, who proposed the standard test in 1946.

A standard enzyme preparation should be run in parallel with an unknown because standardization of DNA preparations and their degree of polymerization in solution is not possible.

Single Radial Enzyme Diffusion (SRED)
This simple method for DNase I activity measurement was introduced by Nadano et al. and is based on the digestion of DNA in the agarose gel by DNase, which is present in samples punched into the gel. DNase activity is represented by the size of a dispensed circular well in an agarose gel layer, in which DNA stained by ethidium bromide is uniformly distributed. After the incubation, a circular dark zone is formed as the enzyme diffuses from the well radially into the gel and cleaves DNA. SRED underwent many modifications, which led to an increase in sensitivity and safety, such as the replacement of ethidium bromide with SYBR Green I or other DNA gel stains.

Colorimetric DNase I Activity Assay

Kinetic colorimetric DNase I activity assay is developed for the assessment of the stability of the human recombinant DNase I (Pulmozyme). The method was adjusted from a colorimetric endpoint enzyme activity assay based on the degradation of a DNA/methyl green complex.

<text>An assay is an investigative (analytic) procedure in laboratory medicine, mining, pharmacology, environmental biology and molecular biology for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, amount, or functional activity of a target entity. The measured entity is often called the analyte, the measurand, or the target of the assay. The analyte can be a drug, biochemical substance, chemical element or compound, or cell in an organism or organic sample. An assay usually aims to measure an analyte&#x27;s intensive property and express it in the relevant measurement unit (e.g. molarity, density, functional activity in enzyme international units, degree of effect in comparison to a standard, etc.).

If the assay involves exogenous reactants (the reagents), then their quantities are kept fixed (or in excess) so that the quantity and quality of the target are the only limiting factors. The difference in the assay outcome is used to deduce the unknown quality or quantity of the target in question. Some assays (e.g., biochemical assays) may be similar to chemical analysis and titration. However, assays typically involve biological material or phenomena that are intrinsically more complex in composition or behavior, or both. Thus, reading of an assay may be noisy and involve greater difficulties in interpretation than an accurate chemical titration. On the other hand, older generation qualitative assays, especially bioassays, may be much more gross and less quantitative (e.g., counting death or dysfunction of an organism or cells in a population, or some descriptive change in some body part of a group of animals).

Assays have become a routine part of modern medical, environmental, pharmaceutical, and forensic technology. Other businesses may also employ them at the industrial, curbside, or field levels. Assays in high commercial demand have been well investigated in research and development sectors of professional industries. They have also undergone generations of development and sophistication. In some cases, they are protected by intellectual property regulations such as patents granted for inventions. Such industrial-scale assays are often performed in well-equipped laboratories and with automated organization of the procedure, from ordering an assay to pre-analytic sample processing (sample collection, necessary manipulations e.g. spinning for separation, aliquoting if necessary, storage, retrieval, pipetting, aspiration, etc.). Analytes are generally tested in high-throughput autoanalyzers, and the results are verified and automatically returned to ordering service providers and end-users. These are made possible through the use of an advanced laboratory informatics system that interfaces with multiple computer terminals with end-users, central servers, the physical autoanalyzer instruments, and other automata.

==Etymology==
According to Etymology Online, the verb &quot;assay&quot; means &quot;to try, endeavor, strive, test the quality of&quot;; from Anglo-French &quot;assaier&quot;, from &quot;assai&quot; (noun), from Old French &quot;essai&quot;, &quot;trial&quot;. Thus the noun &quot;assay&quot; means &quot;trial, test of quality, test of character&quot; (from mid-14th century), from Anglo-French &quot;assai&quot;; and its meaning &quot;analysis&quot; is from the late 14th century.

For assay of currency coins this literally meant analysis of the purity of the gold or silver (or whatever the precious component) that represented the true value of the coin. This might have translated later (possibly after the 14th century) into a broader usage of &quot;analysis&quot;, e.g., in pharmacology, analysis for an important component of a target inside a mixture—such as the active ingredient of a drug inside the inert excipients in a formulation that previously was measured only grossly by its observable action on an organism (e.g., a lethal dose or inhibitory dose).

==General steps==
An assay (analysis) is never an isolated process, as it must be accompanied with pre- and post-analytic procedures. Both the communication order (the request to perform an assay plus related information) &quot;and&quot; the handling of the specimen itself (the collecting, documenting, transporting, and processing done before beginning the assay) are pre-analytic steps. Similarly, after the assay is completed the results must be documented, verified and communicated—the post-analytic steps. As with any multi-step information handling and transmission system, the variation and errors in reporting final results entail not only those intrinsic to the assay itself but also those occurring in the pre-analytic and post-analytic procedures.

While the analytic steps of the assay itself get much attention, it is those that get less attention of the chain of users—the pre-analytic and post-analytic procedures—that typically accumulate the most errors; e.g., pre-analytic steps in medical laboratory assays may contribute 32–75% of all lab errors.

Assays can be very diverse, but generally involve the following general steps: 
# Sample processing and manipulation in order to selectively present the target in a discernible or measurable form to a discrimination/identification/detection system. It might involve a simple centrifugal separation or washing or filtration or capture by some form of selective binding or it may even involve modifying the target e.g. epitope retrieval in immunological assays or cutting down the target into pieces e.g. in Mass Spectrometry. Generally there are multiple separate steps done before an assay and are called preanalytic processing. But some of the manipulations may be inseparable part of the assay itself and will not thus be considered pre-analytic.
# Target-specific discrimination/identification principle: to discriminate from background (noise) of similar components and specifically identify a particular target component (&quot;analyte&quot;) in a biological material by its specific attributes. (e.g. in a PCR assay a specific oligonucleotide primer identifies the target by base pairing based on the specific nucleotide sequence unique to the target).
# Signal (or target) amplification system: The presence and quantity of that analyte is converted into a detectable signal generally involving some method of signal amplification, so that it can be easily discriminated from noise and measured - e.g. in a PCR assay among a mixture of DNA sequences only the specific target is amplified into millions of copies by a DNA polymerase enzyme so that it can be discerned as a more prominent component compared to any other potential components. Sometimes the concentration of the analyte is too large and in that case the assay may involve sample dilution or some sort of signal diminution system which is a negative amplification.
# Signal detection (and interpretation) system: A system of deciphering the amplified signal into an interpretable output that can be quantitative or qualitative. It can be visual or manual very crude methods or can be very sophisticated electronic digital or analog detectors.
#Signal enhancement and noise filtering may be done at any or all of the steps above. Since the more downstream a step/process during an assay, the higher the chance of carrying over noise from the previous process and amplifying it, multiple steps in a sophisticated assay might involve various means of signal-specific sharpening/enhancement arrangements and noise reduction or filtering arrangements. These may simply be in the form of a narrow band-pass optical filter, or a blocking reagent in a binding reaction that prevents nonspecific binding or a quenching reagent in a fluorescence detection system that prevents &quot;autofluorescence&quot; of background objects. 

==Assay types based on the nature of the assay process==
===Time and number of measurements taken===
Depending on whether an assay just looks at a single time point or timed readings taken at multiple time points, an assay may be:
#An end point assay, in which a single measurement is performed after a fixed incubation period; or
#A kinetic assay, in which measurements are performed multiple times over a fixed time interval. Kinetic assay results may be visualized numerically (for example, as a slope parameter representing the rate of signal change over time), or graphically (for example, as a plot of the signal measured at each time point). For kinetic assays, both the magnitude and shape of the measured response over time provide important information.
#A high throughput assay can be either an endpoint or a kinetic assay usually done on an automated platform in 96-, 384- or 1536-well microplate formats (High Throughput Screening). Such assays are able to test large number of compounds or analytes or make functional biological readouts in response to a stimuli and/or compounds being tested.

===Number of analytes detected===
Depending on how many targets or analytes are being measured:
#Usual assays are simple or &quot;single target assays&quot; which is usually the default unless it is called multiplex.
#Multiplex assays are used to simultaneously measure the presence, concentration, activity, or quality of multiple analytes in a single test. The advent of &quot;multiplexing&quot; enabled rapid, efficient sample testing in many fields, including immunology, cytochemistry, genetics/genomics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology.

===Result type===
Depending on the quality of the result produced, assays may be classified into:
# Qualitative assays, i.e. assays which generally give just a pass or fail, or positive or negative or some such sort of only small number of qualitative gradation rather than an exact quantity.
#Semi-quantitative assays, i.e. assays that give the read-out in an approximate fashion rather than an exact number for the quantity of the substance. Generally they have a few more gradations than just two outcomes, positive or negative, e.g. scoring on a scale of 1+ to 4+ as used for blood grouping tests based on RBC agglutination in response to grouping reagents (antibody against blood group antigens).
# Quantitative assays, i.e. assays that give accurate and exact numeric quantitative measure of the amount of a substance in a sample. An example of such an assay used in coagulation testing laboratories for the most common inherited bleeding disease - Von Willebrand disease is VWF antigen assay where the amount of VWF present in a blood sample is measured by an immunoassay.
# Functional assays, i.e. an assay that tries to quantify functioning of an active substance rather than just its quantity. The functional counterpart of the VWF antigen assay is Ristocetin Cofactor assay, which measures the functional activity of the VWF present in a patient&#x27;s plasma by adding exogenous formalin-fixed platelets and gradually increasing quantities of drug named ristocetin while measuring agglutination of the fixed platelets. A similar assay but used for a different purpose is called Ristocetin Induced Platelet Aggregation or RIPA, which tests response of endogenous live platelets from a patient in response to Ristocetin (exogenous) &amp; VWF (usually endogenous).

===Sample type and method===
Depending on the general substrate on which the assay principle is applied:
#Bioassay: when the response is biological activity of live objects. Examples include
##&quot;in vivo&quot;, whole organism (e.g. mouse or other subject injected with a drug)
##&quot;ex vivo&quot; body part (e.g. leg of a frog)
##&quot;ex vivo&quot; organ (e.g. heart of a dog)
##&quot;ex vivo&quot; part of an organ (e.g. a segment of an intestine).
##tissue (e.g. limulus lysate)
##cell (e.g. platelets)
#Ligand binding assay when a ligand (usually a small molecule) binds a receptor (usually a large protein).
#Immunoassay when the response is an antigen antibody binding type reaction.

===Signal amplification===
Depending on the nature of the signal amplification system assays may be of numerous types, to name a few:
#Enzyme assay: Enzymes may be tested by their highly repeating activity on a large number of substrates when loss of a substrate or the making of a product may have a measurable attribute like color or absorbance at a particular wavelength or light or Electrochemiluminescence or electrical/redox activity.
#Light detection systems that may use amplification e.g. by a photodiode or a photomultiplier tube or a cooled charge-coupled device.
#Radioisotope labeled substrates as used in radioimmunoassays and equilibrium dialysis assays and can be detected by the amplification in Gamma counters or X-ray plates, or phosphorimager
#Polymerase Chain Reaction Assays that amplify a DNA (or RNA) target rather than the signal
#Combination Methods Assays may utilize a combination of the above and other amplification methods to improve sensitivity. e.g. Enzyme-linked immunoassay or EIA, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

===Detection method or technology===
Depending on the nature of the Detection system assays can be based on:
#Colony forming or virtual colony count: e.g. by multiplying bacteria or proliferating cells.
#Photometry / spectrophotometry When the absorbance of a specific wavelength of light while passing through a fixed path-length through a cuvette of liquid test sample is measured and the absorbance is compared with a blank and standards with graded amounts of the target compound. If the emitted light is of a specific visible wavelength it may be called colorimetry, or it may involve specific wavelength of light e.g. by use of laser and emission of fluorescent signals of another specific wavelength which is detected via very specific wavelength optical filters.
#Transmittance of light may be used to measure e.g. clearing of opacity of a liquid created by suspended particles due to decrease in number of clumps during a platelet agglutination reaction.
#Turbidimetry when the opacity of straight-transmitted light passing through a liquid sample is measured by detectors placed straight across the light source.
#Nephelometry where a measurement of the amount of light scattering that occurs when a beam of light is passed through the solution is used to determine size and/or concentration and/or size distribution of particles in the sample.
#Reflectometry When color of light reflected from a (usually dry) sample or reactant is assessed e.g. the automated readings of the strip urine dipstick assays.
#Viscoelastic measurements e.g. viscometry, elastography (e.g. thromboelastography)
#Counting assays: e.g. optic Flow cytometric cell or particle counters, or coulter/impedance principle based cell counters
#Imaging assays, that involve image analysis manually or by software:
##Cytometry: When the size statistics of cells is assessed by an image processor.
#Electric detection e.g. involving amperometry, Voltammetry, coulometry may be used directly or indirectly for many types of quantitative measurements.
#Other physical property based assays may use
##Osmometer
##Viscometer
##Ion Selective electrodes
##Syndromic testing

===Petrochemistry===
*Crude oil assay

===Virology===
The HPCE-based viral titer assay uses a proprietary, high-performance capillary electrophoresis system to determine baculovirus titer.

The Trofile assay is used to determine HIV tropism.

The viral plaque assay is to calculate the number of viruses present in a sample. In this technique the number of viral plaques formed by a viral inoculum is counted, from which the actual virus concentration can be determined.

===Cellular secretions===
A wide range of cellular secretions (say, a specific antibody or cytokine) can be detected using the ELISA technique. The number of cells which secrete those particular substances can be determined using a related technique, the ELISPOT assay.

===Drugs===
*Testing for Illegal Drugs
*Radioligand binding assay

==Quality==
When multiple assays measure the same target their results and utility may or may not be comparable depending on the natures of the assay and their methodology, reliability etc. Such comparisons are possible through study of general quality attributes of the assays e.g. principles of measurement (including identification, amplification and detection), dynamic range of detection (usually the range of linearity of the &quot;standard curve&quot;), analytic sensitivity, functional sensitivity, analytic specificity, positive, negative predictive values, turn around time i.e. time taken to finish a whole cycle from the preanalytic steps till the end of the last post analytic step (report dispatch/transmission), throughput i.e. number of assays done per unit time (usually expressed as per hour) etc. Organizations or laboratories that perform Assays for professional purposes e.g. medical diagnosis and prognostics, environmental analysis, forensic proceeding, pharmaceutical research and development must undergo well regulated quality assurance procedures including method validation, regular calibration, analytical quality control, proficiency testing, test accreditation, test licensing and must document appropriate certifications from the relevant regulating bodies in order to establish the reliability of their assays, especially to remain legally acceptable and accountable for the quality of the assay results and also to convince customers to use their assay commercially/professionally.

==List of BioAssay databases ==

=== Bioactivity databases ===

Bioactivity databases correlate structures or other chemical information to bioactivity results taken from bioassays in literature, patents, and screening programs.


=== Protocol databases ===

Protocol databases correlate results from bioassays to their metadata about experimental conditions and protocol designs.

<text>In biochemistry, a nuclease (also archaically known as nucleodepolymerase or polynucleotidase) is an enzyme capable of cleaving the phosphodiester bonds that link nucleotides together to form nucleic acids. Nucleases variously affect single and double stranded breaks in their target molecules. In living organisms, they are essential machinery for many aspects of DNA repair. Defects in certain nucleases can cause genetic instability or immunodeficiency. Nucleases are also extensively used in molecular cloning.

There are two primary classifications based on the locus of activity. Exonucleases digest nucleic acids from the ends. Endonucleases act on regions in the &quot;middle&quot; of target molecules. They are further subcategorized as deoxyribonucleases and ribonucleases. The former acts on DNA, the latter on RNA.

==History==
In the late 1960s, scientists Stuart Linn and Werner Arber isolated examples of the two types of enzymes responsible for phage growth restriction in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. One of these enzymes added a methyl group to the DNA, generating methylated DNA, while the other cleaved unmethylated DNA at a wide variety of locations along the length of the molecule. The first type of enzyme was called a &quot;methylase&quot; and the other a &quot;restriction nuclease&quot;. These enzymatic tools were important to scientists who were gathering the tools needed to &quot;cut and paste&quot; DNA molecules. What was then needed was a tool that would cut DNA at specific sites, rather than at random sites along the length of the molecule, so that scientists could cut DNA molecules in a predictable and reproducible way.

An important development came when H.O. Smith, K.W. Wilcox, and T.J. Kelly, working at Johns Hopkins University in 1968, isolated and characterized the first restriction nuclease whose functioning depended on a specific DNA nucleotide sequence. Working with Haemophilus influenzae bacteria, this group isolated an enzyme, called &quot;Hind&quot;II, that always cut DNA molecules at a particular point within a specific sequence of six base pairs. They found that the &quot;Hind&quot;II enzyme always cuts directly in the center of this sequence (between the 3rd and 4th base pairs).

==Numerical Classification System==
Most nucleases are classified by the Enzyme Commission number of the &quot;Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology&quot; as hydrolases (EC-number 3). The nucleases belong just like phosphodiesterase, lipase and phosphatase to the esterases (EC-number 3.1), a subgroup of the hydrolases. The esterases to which nucleases belong are classified with the EC-numbers 3.1.11 - EC-number 3.1.31.

== Structure ==
Nuclease primary structure is by and large poorly conserved and minimally conserved at active sites, the surfaces of which primarily comprise acidic and basic amino acid residues. Nucleases can be classified into folding families.
==Site recognition==
A nuclease must associate with a nucleic acid before it can cleave the molecule. That entails a degree of recognition. Nucleases variously employ both nonspecific and specific associations in their modes of recognition and binding. Both modes play important roles in living organisms, especially in DNA repair.

Nonspecific endonucleases involved in DNA repair can scan DNA for target sequences or damage. Such a nuclease diffuses along DNA until it encounters a target, upon which the residues of its active site interact with the chemical groups of the DNA. In the case of endonucleases such as EcoRV, BamHI, and PvuII, this nonspecific binding involves electrostatic interactions between minimal surface area of the protein and the DNA. This weak association leaves the overall shape of the DNA undeformed, remaining in B-form.

A forms far stronger associations by contrast. It draws DNA into the deep groove of its DNA-binding domain. This results in significant deformation of the DNA tertiary structure and is accomplished with a surfaces rich in basic (positively charged) residues. It engages in extensive electrostatic interaction with the DNA.

Some nucleases involved in DNA repair exhibit partial sequence-specificity. However most are nonspecific, instead recognizing structural abnormalities produced in the DNA backbone by base pair mismatches.

===Structure specific nuclease===

For details see flap endonuclease.

===Sequence specific nuclease===

There are more than 900 restriction enzymes, some sequence specific and some not, have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria since the initial discovery of &quot;Hind&quot;II. These restriction enzymes generally have names that reflect their origin—The first letter of the name comes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of the prokaryotic cell from which they were isolated. For example, &quot;Eco&quot;RI comes from Escherichia coli RY13 bacteria, while HindII comes from Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd. Numbers following the nuclease names indicate the order in which the enzymes were isolated from single strains of bacteria: &quot;Eco&quot;RI, &quot;Eco&quot;RII.

==Endonucleases==

A restriction endonuclease functions by &quot;scanning&quot; the length of a DNA molecule. Once it encounters its particular specific recognition sequence, it will bind to the DNA molecule and makes one cut in each of the two sugar-phosphate backbones. The positions of these two cuts, both in relation to each other, and to the recognition sequence itself, are determined by the identity of the restriction endonuclease. Different endonucleases yield different sets of cuts, but one endonuclease will always cut a particular base sequence the same way, no matter what DNA molecule it is acting on. Once the cuts have been made, the DNA molecule will break into fragments.

===Staggered cutting===

Not all restriction endonucleases cut symmetrically and leave blunt ends like &quot;Hind&quot;II described above. Many endonucleases cleave the DNA backbones in positions that are not directly opposite each other, creating overhangs. For example, the nuclease &quot;Eco&quot;RI has the recognition sequence codice_1.

When the enzyme encounters this sequence, it cleaves each backbone between the G and the closest A base residues. Once the cuts have been made, the resulting fragments are held together only by the relatively weak hydrogen bonds that hold the complementary bases to each other. The weakness of these bonds allows the DNA fragments to separate from each other. Each resulting fragment has a protruding 5&#x27; end composed of unpaired bases. Other enzymes create cuts in the DNA backbone which result in protruding 3&#x27; ends. Protruding ends—both 3&#x27; and 5&#x27;—are sometimes called &quot;sticky ends&quot; because they tend to bond with complementary sequences of bases. In other words, if an unpaired length of bases codice_2 encounters another unpaired length with the sequence codice_3 they will bond to each other—they are &quot;sticky&quot; for each other. Ligase enzyme is then used to join the phosphate backbones of the two molecules. The cellular origin, or even the species origin, of the sticky ends does not affect their stickiness. Any pair of complementary sequences will tend to bond, even if one of the sequences comes from a length of human DNA, and the other comes from a length of bacterial DNA. In fact, it is this quality of stickiness that allows production of recombinant DNA molecules, molecules which are composed of DNA from different sources, and which has given birth to the genetic engineering technology.

==Role in nature==
===DNA repair===
With all cells depending on DNA as the medium of genetic information, genetic quality control is an essential function of all organisms. DNA replication is an error prone process, and DNA molecules themselves are vulnerable to modification by many metabolic and environmental stressors. Ubiquitous examples include reactive oxygen species, near ultraviolet, and ionizing radiation. Many nucleases participate in DNA repair by recognizing damage sites and cleaving them from the surrounding DNA. These enzymes function independently or in complexes. Most nucleases involved in DNA repair are not sequence-specific. They recognize damage sites through deformation of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) secondary structure.

====Replication proofreading====
During DNA replication, DNA polymerases elongate new strands of DNA against complementary template strands. Most DNA polymerases comprise two different enzymatic domains: a polymerase and a proofreading exonuclease. The polymerase elongates the new strand in the 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; direction. The exonuclease removes erroneous nucleotides from the same strand in the 3’ → 5’ direction. This exonuclease activity is essential for a DNA polymerase&#x27;s ability to proofread. Deletions inactivating or removing these nucleases increase rates of mutation and mortality in affected microbes and cancer in mice.

====Halted replication fork====
Many forms of DNA damage stop progression of the replication fork, causing the DNA polymerases and associated machinery to abandon the fork. It must then be processed by fork-specific proteins. The most notable is MUS81. Deletions of which causes UV or methylation damage sensitivity in yeast, in addition to meiotic defects.

====Okazaki fragment processing====
A ubiquitous task in cells is the removal of Okazaki fragment RNA primers from replication. Most such primers are excised from newly synthesized lagging strand DNA by endonucleases of the family RNase H. In eukaryotes and in archaea, the flap endonuclease FEN1 also participates in the processing of Okazaki fragments.

====Mismatch repair====
DNA mismatch repair in any given organism is effected by a suite of mismatch-specific endonucleases. In prokaryotes, this role is primarily filled by MutSLH and very short patch repair (VSP repair) associated proteins.

The MutSLH system (comprising MutS, MutL, and MutH) corrects point mutations and small turns. MutS recognizes and binds to mismatches, where it recruits MutL and MutH. MutL mediates the interaction between MutS and MutH, and enhances the endonucleasic activity of the latter. MutH recognizes hemimethylated codice_4 sites and cleaves next to the codice_5 of the non-methylated strand (the more recently synthesized strand).

VSP repair is initiated by the endonuclease Vsr. It corrects a specific codice_6 mismatch caused by the spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines to thymines. Vsr recognizes the sequence codice_7,
where it nicks the DNA strand on the 5&#x27; side of the mismatched thymine (underlined in the previous sequence). One of the exonucleases RecJ, ExoVII, or ExoI then degrades the site before DNA polymerase resynthesizes the gap in the strand.

====Base excision repair====
AP site formation is a common occurrence in dsDNA. It is the result of spontaneous hydrolysis and the activity of DNA glycosylases as an intermediary step in base excision repair. These AP sites are removed by AP endonucleases, which effect single strand breaks around the site.

====Nucleotide excision repair====
Nucleotide excision repair, not to be confused with base excision repair, involves the removal and replacement of damaged nucleotides. Instances of crosslinking, adducts, and lesions (generated by ultraviolet light or reactive oxygen species) can trigger this repair pathway. Short stretches of single stranded DNA containing such damaged nucleotide are removed from duplex DNA by separate endonucleases effecting nicks upstream and downstream of the damage. Deletions or mutations which affect these nucleases instigate increased sensitivity to ultraviolet damage and carcinogenesis. Such abnormalities can even impinge neural development.

In bacteria, both cuts executed by the UvrB-UvrC complex. In budding yeast, Rad2 and the Rad1-Rad10 complex make the 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; cuts, respectively. In mammals, the homologs XPG and XPF-ERCC1 affect the same respective nicks.

====Double-strand break repair====
Double-strand breaks, both intentional and unintentional, regularly occur in cells. Unintentional breaks are commonly generated by ionizing radiation, various exogenous and endogenous chemical agents, and halted replication forks. Intentional breaks are generated as intermediaries in meiosis and V(D)J recombination, which are primarily repaired through homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Both cases require the ends in double strand breaks be processed by nucleases before repair can take place. One such nuclease is Mre11 complexed with Rad50. Mutations of Mre11 can precipitate ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder.

V(D)J recombination involves opening stem-loops structures associated with double-strand breaks and subsequently joining both ends. The Artemis-DNAPKcs complex participates in this reaction. Although Artemis exhibits 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; ssDNA exonuclease activity when alone, its complexing with DNA-PKcs allows for endonucleasic processing of the stem-loops. Defects of either protein confers severe immunodeficiency.

Homologous recombination, on the other hand, involves two homologous DNA duplexes connected by D-loops or Holliday junctions. In bacteria, endonucleases like RuvC &quot;resolve&quot; Holliday junctions into two separate dsDNAs by cleaving the junctions at two symmetrical sites near the junction centre. In eukaryotes, FEN1, XPF-ERCC1, and MUS81 cleave the D-loops, and Cce1/Ydc2 processes Holliday junctions in mitochondria.

== Meganucleases ==
The frequency at which a particular nuclease will cut a given DNA molecule depends on the complexity of the DNA and the length of the nuclease&#x27;s recognition sequence; due to the statistical likelihood of finding the bases in a particular order by chance, a longer recognition sequence will result in less frequent digestion. For example, a given four-base sequence (corresponding to the recognition site for a hypothetical nuclease) would be predicted to occur every 256 base pairs on average (where 4^4=256), but any given six-base sequence would be expected to occur once every 4,096 base pairs on average (4^6=4096).

One unique family of nucleases is the meganucleases, which are characterized by having larger, and therefore less common, recognition sequences consisting of 12 to 40 base pairs. These nucleases are particularly useful for genetic engineering and Genome engineering applications in complex organisms such as plants and mammals, where typically larger genomes (numbering in the billions of base pairs) would result in frequent and deleterious site-specific digestion using traditional nucleases.

<text>In the mathematical field of functional analysis there are several standard topologies which are given to the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Banach space .

== Introduction ==

Let formula_1 be a sequence of linear operators on the Banach space . Consider the statement that formula_2 converges to some operator on . 
This could have several different meanings:
* If formula_3, that is, the operator norm of formula_4 (the supremum of formula_5, where ranges over the unit ball in ) converges to 0, we say that formula_6 in the uniform operator topology.
* If formula_7 for all formula_8, then we say formula_6 in the strong operator topology.
* Finally, suppose that for all we have formula_7 in the weak topology of . This means that formula_11 for all continuous linear functionals on . In this case we say that formula_6 in the weak operator topology.

== List of topologies on B(&quot;H&quot;) ==

There are many topologies that can be defined on besides the ones used above; most are at first only defined when is a Hilbert space, even though in many cases there are appropriate generalisations. 
The topologies listed below are all locally convex, which implies that they are defined by a family of seminorms. 

In analysis, a topology is called strong if it has many open sets and weak if it has few open sets, so that the corresponding modes of convergence are, respectively, strong and weak. 
(In topology proper, these terms can suggest the opposite meaning, so strong and weak are replaced with, respectively, fine and coarse.) 
The diagram on the right is a summary of the relations, with the arrows pointing from strong to weak.

If is a Hilbert space, the linear space of Hilbert space operators has a (unique) predual formula_13,
consisting of the trace class operators, whose dual is . 
The seminorm for &quot;w&quot; positive in the predual is defined to be

If is a vector space of linear maps on the vector space , then is defined to be the weakest topology on such that all elements of are continuous. 

* The norm topology or uniform topology or uniform operator topology is defined by the usual norm ||&quot;x&quot;|| on . It is stronger than all the other topologies below. 
* The weak (Banach space) topology is , in other words the weakest topology such that all elements of the dual are continuous. It is the weak topology on the Banach space . It is stronger than the ultraweak and weak operator topologies. (Warning: the weak Banach space topology and the weak operator topology and the ultraweak topology are all sometimes called the weak topology, but they are different.)
* The Mackey topology or Arens-Mackey topology is the strongest locally convex topology on such that the dual is , and is also the uniform convergence topology on , -compact convex subsets of . It is stronger than all topologies below. 
* The σ-strong-* topology or ultrastrong-* topology is the weakest topology stronger than the ultrastrong topology such that the adjoint map is continuous. It is defined by the family of seminorms and for positive elements of . It is stronger than all topologies below.
*The σ-strong topology or ultrastrong topology or strongest topology or strongest operator topology is defined by the family of seminorms for positive elements of . It is stronger than all the topologies below other than the strong* topology. Warning: in spite of the name &quot;strongest topology&quot;, it is weaker than the norm topology.)
*The σ-weak topology or ultraweak topology or weak-* operator topology or weak-* topology or weak topology or ) topology is defined by the family of seminorms |(&quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;)| for elements &quot;w&quot; of . It is stronger than the weak operator topology. (Warning: the weak Banach space topology and the weak operator topology and the ultraweak topology are all sometimes called the weak topology, but they are different.)
* The strong-* operator topology or strong-* topology is defined by the seminorms ||&quot;x&quot;(&quot;h&quot;)|| and ||&quot;x&quot;*(&quot;h&quot;)|| for . It is stronger than the strong and weak operator topologies.
* The strong operator topology (SOT) or strong topology is defined by the seminorms ||&quot;x&quot;(&quot;h&quot;)|| for . It is stronger than the weak operator topology.
* The weak operator topology (WOT) or weak topology is defined by the seminorms |(&quot;x&quot;(&quot;h&quot;1), &quot;h&quot;2)| for . (Warning: the weak Banach space topology, the weak operator topology, and the ultraweak topology are all sometimes called the weak topology, but they are different.)

== Relations between the topologies ==

The continuous linear functionals on for the weak, strong, and strong* (operator) topologies are the same, and are the finite linear combinations of the linear functionals
(x&quot;h&quot;1, &quot;h&quot;2) for . 
The continuous linear functionals on for the ultraweak, ultrastrong, ultrastrong* and Arens-Mackey topologies are the same, and are the elements of the predual . 

By definition, the continuous linear functionals in the norm topology are the same as those in the weak Banach space topology. 
This dual is a rather large space with many pathological elements. 

On norm bounded sets of , the weak (operator) and ultraweak topologies coincide. This can be seen via, for instance, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem. 
For essentially the same reason, the ultrastrong
topology is the same as the strong topology on any (norm) bounded subset of . 
Same is true for the Arens-Mackey topology, the ultrastrong*, and the strong* topology.

In locally convex spaces, closure of convex sets can be characterized by the continuous linear functionals. Therefore, for a convex subset of , the conditions that be closed in the ultrastrong*, ultrastrong, and ultraweak topologies are all equivalent and are also equivalent to the conditions that
for all , has closed intersection with the closed ball of radius in the strong*, strong, or weak (operator) topologies. 

The norm topology is metrizable and the others are not; in fact they fail to be first-countable. 
However, when is separable, all the topologies above are metrizable when restricted to the unit ball (or to any norm-bounded subset).

== Topology to use ==

The most commonly used topologies are the norm, strong, and weak operator topologies. 
The weak operator topology is useful for compactness arguments, because the unit ball is compact by the Banach–Alaoglu theorem. 
The norm topology is fundamental because it makes into a Banach space, but it is too strong for many purposes; for example, is not separable in this topology. 
The strong operator topology could be the most commonly used.

The ultraweak and ultrastrong topologies are better-behaved than the weak and strong operator topologies, but their definitions are more complicated, so they are usually not used unless their better properties are really needed. 
For example, the dual space of in the weak or strong operator topology is too small to have much analytic content.

The adjoint map is not continuous in the strong operator and ultrastrong topologies, while the strong* and ultrastrong* topologies are modifications so that the adjoint becomes continuous. They are not used very often.

The Arens–Mackey topology and the weak Banach space topology are relatively rarely used.

To summarize, the three essential topologies on are the norm, ultrastrong, and ultraweak topologies. 
The weak and strong operator topologies are widely used as convenient approximations to the ultraweak and ultrastrong topologies. The other topologies are relatively obscure.

<doc id="496334" wikidata="Q306436" url="?curid=496334" title="Sigma factor">
<text>A sigma factor (σ factor or specificity factor) is a protein needed for initiation of transcription in bacteria. It is a bacterial transcription initiation factor that enables specific binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to gene promoters. It is homologous to archaeal transcription factor B and to eukaryotic factor TFIIB. The specific sigma factor used to initiate transcription of a given gene will vary, depending on the gene and on the environmental signals needed to initiate transcription of that gene. Selection of promoters by RNA polymerase is dependent on the sigma factor that associates with it. They are also found in plant chloroplasts as a part of the bacteria-like plastid-encoded polymerase (PEP).

The sigma factor, together with RNA polymerase, is known as the RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Every molecule of RNA polymerase holoenzyme contains exactly one sigma factor subunit, which in the model bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is one of those listed below. The number of sigma factors varies between bacterial species. &quot;E. coli&quot; has seven sigma factors. Sigma factors are distinguished by their characteristic molecular weights. For example, σ70 is the sigma factor with a molecular weight of 70 kDa.

The sigma factor in the RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex is required for the initiation of transcription, although once that stage is finished, it is dissociated from the complex and the RNAP continues elongation on its own.

==Specialized sigma factors==
Different sigma factors are utilized under different environmental conditions. These specialized sigma factors bind the promoters of genes appropriate to the environmental conditions, increasing the transcription of those genes.

Sigma factors in &quot;E. coli&quot;:
*σ70(RpoD) – σA – the &quot;housekeeping&quot; sigma factor or also called as primary sigma factor (Group 1), transcribes most genes in growing cells. Every cell has a &quot;housekeeping&quot; sigma factor that keeps essential genes and pathways operating. In the case of &quot;E. coli&quot; and other gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, the &quot;housekeeping&quot; sigma factor is σ70. Genes recognized by σ70 all contain similar promoter consensus sequences consisting of two parts. Relative to the DNA base corresponding to the start of the RNA transcript, the consensus promoter sequences are characteristically centered at 10 and 35 nucleotides before the start of transcription (−10 and −35).
*σ19 (FecI) – the ferric citrate sigma factor, regulates the &quot;fec&quot; gene for iron transport and metabolism
*σ24 (RpoE) – extreme heat stress response and the extracellular proteins sigma factor
*σ28 (RpoF/FliA) – the flagellar synthesis and chemotaxis sigma factor
*σ32 (RpoH) – the heat shock sigma factor, it is turned on when the bacteria are exposed to heat. Due to the higher expression, the factor will bind with a high probability to the polymerase-core-enzyme. Doing so, other heatshock proteins are expressed, which enable the cell to survive higher temperatures. Some of the enzymes that are expressed upon activation of σ32 are chaperones, proteases and DNA-repair enzymes.
*σ38 (RpoS) – the starvation/stationary phase sigma factor
*σ54 (RpoN) – the nitrogen-limitation sigma factor

There are also anti-sigma factors that inhibit the function of sigma factors and anti-anti-sigma factors that restore sigma factor function.

== Structure ==
By sequence similarity, most sigma factors are σ70-like (). They have four main regions (domains) that are generally conserved:

 N-terminus --------------------- C-terminus
 1.1 2 3 4

The regions are further subdivided. For example, region 2 includes 1.2 and 2.1 through 2.4.

Domain 1.1 is found only in &quot;primary sigma factors&quot; (RpoD, RpoS in &quot;E.coli&quot;; &quot;Group 1&quot;). It is involved in ensuring the sigma factor will only bind the promoter when it is complexed with the RNA polymerase. Domains 2-4 each interact with specific promoter elements and with RNAP. Region 2.4 recognizes and binds to the promoter −10 element (called the &quot;Pribnow box&quot;). Region 4.2 recognizes and binds to the promoter −35 element.

Not every sigma factor of the σ70 family contains all the domains. Group 2, which includes RpoS, is very similar to Group 1 but lacks domain 1. Group 3 also lacks domain 1, and includes σ28. Group 4, also known as the Extracytoplasmic Function (ECF) group, lack both σ1.1 and σ3. RpoE is a member.
Other known sigma factors are of the σ54/RpoN () type. They are functional sigma factors, but they have significantly different primary amino acid sequences.

==Retention during transcription elongation==
The core RNA polymerase (consisting of 2 alpha (α), 1 beta (β), 1 beta-prime (β&#x27;), and 1 omega (ω) subunits) binds a sigma factor to form a complex called the RNA polymerase holoenzyme. It was previously believed that the RNA polymerase holoenzyme initiates transcription, while the core RNA polymerase alone synthesizes RNA. Thus, the accepted view was that sigma factor must dissociate upon transition from transcription initiation to transcription elongation (this transition is called &quot;promoter escape&quot;). This view was based on analysis of purified complexes of RNA polymerase stalled at initiation and at elongation. Finally, structural models of RNA polymerase complexes predicted that, as the growing RNA product becomes longer than ~15 nucleotides, sigma must be &quot;pushed out&quot; of the holoenzyme, since there is a steric clash between RNA and a sigma domain. However, σ70 can remain attached in complex with the core RNA polymerase in early elongation and sometimes throughout elongation. Indeed, the phenomenon of promoter-proximal pausing indicates that sigma plays roles during early elongation. All studies are consistent with the assumption that promoter escape reduces the lifetime of the sigma-core interaction from very long at initiation (too long to be measured in a typical biochemical experiment) to a shorter, measurable lifetime upon transition to elongation.

==Sigma cycle==
It had long been thought that the sigma factor obligatorily leaves the core enzyme once it has initiated transcription, allowing it to link to another core enzyme and initiate transcription at another site. Thus, the sigma factor would cycle from one core to another.
However, fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to show that the sigma factor does not obligatorily leave the core. Instead, it changes its &quot;binding&quot; with the core during initiation and elongation. Therefore, the sigma factor cycles between a strongly bound state during initiation and a weakly bound state during elongation.

== Sigma factor competition ==

The number of RNAPs in bacterial cells (e.g., &quot;E. coli&quot;) have been shown to be smaller than the number of sigma factors. Consequently, if a certain sigma factor is overexpressed, not only will it increase the expression levels of genes whose promoters have preference for that sigma factor, but it will also reduce the probability that genes with promoters with preference for other sigma factors will be expressed.

Meanwhile, transcription initiation has two major rate limiting steps: the closed and the open complex formation. However, only the dynamics of the first step depends on the concentration of sigma factors. Interestingly, the faster the closed complex formation relative to the open complex formation, the less responsive is a promoter to changes in sigma factors’ concentration (see for a model and empirical data of this phenomenon).

== Genes with dual sigma factor preference ==

While most genes of &quot;E. coli&quot; can be recognized by an RNAP with one and only one type of sigma factor (e.g. sigma 70), a few genes (~ 5%) have what is called a “dual sigma factor preference”, that is, they can respond to two different sigma factors, as reported in RegulonDB. The most common ones are those promoters that can respond to both sigma 70 and to sigma 38 (iIlustrated in the figure) . Studies of the dynamics of these genes showed that when the cells enter stationary growth they are almost as induced as those genes that have preference for σ38 alone. This induction level was shown to be predictable from their promoter sequence. A model of their dynamics is shown in the figure. In the future, these promoters may become useful tools in synthetic genetic constructs in &quot;E. coli&quot;.

<text>Muldraugh Hill is an escarpment in Bullitt, Hardin, Jefferson, and Nelson counties of central Kentucky separating the Bluegrass on the north and north-east from the Pennyrile on the south and south-west. This escarpment fades into the Pottsville Escarpment on the east and terminates at the Ohio River in the west. However, in truth, it continues in Indiana as Floyds Knobs.

In parts of its eastern stretches, Muldraugh Hill is little more than a slight hill, but in some of the western areas, it is represented by extensive areas of knobs. This landform consists mostly of siltstones and shales, with some minor limestones, lying between the limestones and dolomites of the older Bluegrass and the limestones of the newer Pennyrile. Rock outcrops are minor except where the overlying limestones are exposed in the north of Fort Knox.

The Jefferson Memorial Forest in Louisville, Kentucky and Bernheim Forest in Bullitt and Nelson Counties are both located within the knobs of Muldraugh Hill, as is part of Fort Knox.

<doc id="496347" wikidata="Q1055874" url="?curid=496347" title="University of Bridgeport">
<text>The University of Bridgeport (UB or UBPT) is a private university in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The university is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. In 2021, the university was purchased by Goodwin University; it retained its own name, brand, and board of trustees.

Founded originally as the Junior College of Connecticut, it is the only university in Bridgeport and one of the largest in Connecticut. The university offers more than 60 degree programs to over 5,000 students at the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels. This includes the only Chinese medicine program in Connecticut; one of two, along with University of Connecticut, medical laboratory sciences programs in Connecticut; and one of the few chiropractic schools on the East Coast. The university hosted a program in naturopathic medicine until it was discontinued in 2019.

E. Everett Cortright, Alfred Fones, and former Raybestos President Sumner Simpson opened the Junior College of Connecticut, the first of its kind in the Northeastern United States. The school purchased the former P. T. Barnum estate and neighboring property adjacent to Seaside Park and became a four-year institution in 1947, when it was renamed the University of Bridgeport.

==History==
===Origins===
The university began in 1927 as the first junior college in Connecticut. Founders E. Everett Cortright, Alfred Fones, and Sumner Simpson saw a need in Bridgeport, then one of only six American cities of more than 100,000 residents lacking a college or university. The school expanded significantly, adding dormitories and a school of business. The school purchased the former P. T. Barnum estate and neighboring property adjacent to Seaside Park and became a four-year institution in 1947, when it was renamed the University of Bridgeport.

===Naming and development===
Founder and first President Everett Cortright and Alfred Civillion Fones chartered the Junior College of Connecticut in November 1927 to expand the academic opportunities for local Connecticut youth. It was the first junior college chartered in the Northeastern United States. Cortright, the former superintendent of schools in Bridgeport and a professor of education at Columbia University, knew there was a great desire for higher education, given there were no colleges easily accessible to people in the region.

On the twentieth anniversary of the Junior College of Connecticut in 1947, the governor of Connecticut chartered the institution as a four-year university with authority to grant the baccalaureate degree. By that time, the P.T. Barnum estate at Seaside Park had been purchased. The Junior College of Connecticut was retained and the College of Arts and Sciences and the Colleges of Business Administration were established at once. These were followed soon after by the Colleges of Nursing, Education and Engineering. The legislature of Connecticut acknowledged the school&#x27;s growth by renaming the institution &quot;University of Bridgeport&quot; in 1947.

The university&#x27;s merger with the Weylister Secretarial Junior College of Milford, Connecticut, afforded additional expansion. The school became a division of the Junior College of Connecticut, as did the Fones School of Dental Hygiene which, at its inception in 1949, was the only such school in Connecticut and the second in New England.

The school began awarding master&#x27;s degrees in 1951. Under President James Halsey, the university was among the first American universities to enroll a significant number of international students. In 1953, Arnold College merged with and was incorporated into the College of Education. Founded in 1886, Arnold was the oldest co-educational school of physical education in the United States. It was directed for many years by E. Herman Arnold, an eminent and pioneering educator.

The university had moved all of its operations from its Fairfield Avenue location to the campus at Seaside Park by 1950. There it occupied 22 acres of land that now has grown to 52 acres. An enrollment of almost 3,500 students included the first influx of international students. The university awarded its first master&#x27;s degree in 1951 and its first doctoral program in Educational Leadership in 1979, and added a Ph.D. degree program in Computer Science and Engineering in 2006. Two terminal, professional, alternative medicine programs in Chiropractic and Naturopathic Medicine were established in 1991 and 1996 respectively. The naturopathic medicine program was discontinued in 2019.

===Affilitation with the Unification Church===
In 1990, after severe endowment losses, discussion began about affiliating or possibly merging the university with either the University of New Haven or Sacred Heart University.
The university was approached by the Professors World Peace Academy (PWPA), an affiliate of the Unification Church, but its offer to bail out the university was spurned by the trustees who said the school was &quot;not going to have anything to do with the offer&quot; and were concerned that such an affiliation would damage the university&#x27;s reputation.

Problems continued to plague the university; enrollment fell to 1,300 in 1991. Debt rose to over $22 million in 1991–92. Serious plans to merge the university with Sacred Heart fell through in 1992; the law school instead wanted to associate with Quinnipiac University, but Sacred Heart maintained that any takeover would have to include the Law School. There were other universities willing to take over the school, but were unwilling to take on its debt. The university&#x27;s charter required the trustees to enter into &quot;serious negotiations&quot;, and they accepted the offer, giving the PWPA sixteen spots as trustees, constituting a majority. The PWPA invested $50.5 million in the university on May 30, 1992, enabling the university to keep its accreditation.

A two-year faculty strike, started in the midst of the university&#x27;s financial troubles, intensified when the trustees gave control to the PWPA. Eventually, sixty-six professors and librarians agreed to a &quot;divorce&quot; with the university in return for compensation of up to a year&#x27;s salary. In a similar move, the Law School decided to cut ties with the university, separating from it. In order for the law school to remain open it had to merge with a financially sound university. The law school faculty and students voted to merge with Quinnipiac University and the name was officially changed to the Quinnipiac University School of Law.

Once PWPA-appointed trustees constituted a majority on the board of trustees, the trustees retained the president at the time, Edwin G. Eigel Jr. (1932–2008). Eigel served as president until 1995. He was succeeded by distinguished Holocaust scholar, professor emeritus at Florida State, and former PWPA president Richard L. Rubenstein, who served from 1995 to 1999. Neil Albert Salonen, a member of the Unification Church, was the chairman of the university&#x27;s board of trustees when he was chosen to serve as ninth University president in 1999. He had earlier managed several Unification Church related organizations, and had served as president of the Unification Church of the United States from 1973 to 1980, and as chairman of the International Cultural Foundation, prior to becoming the chief executive of the university. Salonen retired in 2018.

Since 2003 the university has been financially independent from PWPA after having received funding from the PWPA from 1992 until 2002. It has remained non-sectarian throughout. Turnover on the board of trustees had led, over time, to a very different composition, when compared to the 1991 board. As he retired, Salonen stated that &quot;2 or 3&quot; members of the board of trustees were church members. Under his successor, Laura Skandera Trombley, the board of trustees was enlarged to 36 members. She announced, in an email to faculty, staff, and students on May 24, 2019, that &quot;During the May 17 meeting of the UB Board of Trustees, the body unanimously voted to amend the university&#x27;s bylaws to remove any references to and governance rights of the Professors World Peace Academy, an affiliate of the Unification Church...This amendment finalizes a termination process, which was long under way. The board expressed its gratitude for previous support.&quot;

=== Present day ===
Enrollment grew from 1,383 total students in 1992 to 5,323 students in fall 2008, a trend which continued throughout the decade, with 5,434 students enrolled in fall 2018. In 1991, the school added a chiropractic program, the first university-affiliated program of its kind in the U.S. Additional doctoral programs in naturopathic medicine and computer science and engineering were added in 1996 and 2006. The Physician Assistant Institute matriculated its first class at the university in January 2011. In 2014, the school partnered with the Peace Corps to offer New England&#x27;s first Peace Corps Preparatory Program. In 2014, the School of Nursing at Bridgeport Hospital began a merger with the university which was completed over the next few years.

As of 2014, the university consisted of thirteen schools, institutes and colleges:

*School of Arts and Sciences
*Ernest C. Trefz School of Business
*College of Public and International Affairs (CPIA)
*School of Engineering
*Shintaro Akatsu School of Design (SASD)
*Fones School of Dental Hygiene
*School of Continuing and Professional Studies
*College of Chiropractic
*School of Education
*College of Naturopathic Medicine
*Acupuncture Institute (UBAI)
*Nutrition Institute
*Physician Assistant Institute (PAI)
*School of Nursing (In April 2014 the University of Bridgeport and Bridgeport Hospital announced an agreement to absorb the Bridgeport Hospital School of Nursing into the university, forming the University of Bridgeport School of Nursing.)
In 2018, the university reorganized these colleges and schools into three colleges (with constituent programs and schools), in order to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, streamline administrative channels, and create clarity and identity for current and potential students:

* The College of Arts &amp; Sciences 
* The College of Business, Education, &amp; Engineering
* The College of Health Sciences

On July 25, 2019, the University of Bridgeport and Marlboro College announced plans to enter into a merger that would create an expanded university with deeper connections between professional programs and the liberal arts. It was announced in September 2019 that the merger was no longer in the works. On April 2, 2020, Laura Skandera Trombley resigned as president to assume the presidency of Southwestern University in Texas. Provost Stephen Healey was appointed interim president, and Tarek Sobh, vice president for research &amp; economic development and dean of the College of Business, Education, and Engineering, was appointed interim provost.

In 2019, the university announced that the College of Naturopathic Medicine would be discontinued.

In January 2021, it was announced that the non-profit Goodwin University would be taking over the University of Bridgeport, and operating it as a subsidiary, although UB would retain its own name and brand. Two months later, Paier College (formerly Paier College of Art) announced plans to move its campus to Bridgeport, into facilities formerly used by the University of Bridgeport, before the start of the fall 2021 session.

==Region and campus==
The stately old Victorian homes on campus date from the late 1800s to the early 1900s, some owned by leading area industrialists and some by family and friends of showman P. T. Barnum. The university has restored two of the homes, and done substantial work on a third. These homes, as well as a newer 1937 home in International style, form the Marina Park Historic District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Academics==

The University of Bridgeport is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The university is also accredited by the board of governors of the Connecticut Department of Higher Education.

UB also has adult and continuing education/distance learning programs on their main campus, as well as their Waterbury branch campus, with a total of 125 different programs of study.

For undergraduates, as of 2004, the school started an honors program that allows for the awarding of an honors degree upon graduation, if certain honors course requirements and academic standards (such as a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0) have been maintained. The program also offers additional course options to students enrolled in the honors program.

The online master&#x27;s degree in engineering was also ranked #16 in 2013.

In 2021, the University of Bridgeport was ranked #298–#389 in National Universities by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Athletics==

The University of Bridgeport competes in NCAA Division II athletics and has eight women&#x27;s sports, and five men&#x27;s sports. The Women&#x27;s Soccer Team were the 2018 National NCAA Division II Champions.

==Student life==
===Greek life===
Recognized fraternities and sororities at the university include:

===Campus safety===
Around 2000, to address safety concerns both on and off-campus, the university instituted a program where students are issued a portable alarm unit (PAL) that pinpoints their position and enables campus security to get to them in under two minutes. This system works immediately on the university campus, and in the neighborhood surrounding campus. Further, the Campus Security Department has 40 unarmed personnel that provide security services 24 hours a day, with both on-foot and on-bicycle patrols. In 2018, in the midst of a rapid gentrification in the neighborhood surrounding the campus, the global security firm ADT ranked UB as the safest campus in Connecticut. In 2019, the university discontinued the use of PALs in favor of the LiveSafe app for mobile devices.

===Palmetto===
In front of the Eleanor N. Dana Hall at the College of Naturopathic Medicine, there is a Sabal Palmetto, a small palm about six feet in height with a spread of five feet. This tree is notable for growing so far north from it common cultivation range., which ends at about Virginias eastern shore. What is also notable is it is growing in USDA zone 7a-7b, while palmettos usually grow in 8a and higher. This tree suffered die-back over the harsh 2017-2018 winter and its height was reduced from about 8 feet using the tip of the tallest frond. This Sabal Palmetto was grown from seed from collected in Sun City Center, FL, in 2005. It was planted outside in its current location in 2009 by Eugene Zampieron.
It is in a favorable microclimate, very close to a south-facing masonry wall, and is about 500 ft from Long Island Sound with it getting protection each winter.
It is listed by Connecticut&#x27;s Notable Trees website as the first plant of its species and the first palm tree on the database. It is also a Connecticut champion tree.

==Traditions==

===University seal===
Bridgeport&#x27;s seal combines four core elements of its traditions and distinct character. In the upper left quadrant, the lamp of learning, which has been an element of the official Bridgeport&#x27;s seal since 1931, is shown. In the upper right quadrant of the seal, the tree of life is shown, symbolizing personal and institutional growth. The lower left shows Bridgeport&#x27;s seascape, illustrating the university&#x27;s campus on Long Island Sound. The lower right quadrant shows the Perry Arch, representing tradition, solid foundations, and performance.

<doc id="496350" wikidata="Q171803" url="?curid=496350" title="La Blue Girl">
<text>is an erotic anime and manga series by Toshio Maeda. Like Maeda&#x27;s other hentai series (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Urotsukidōji&quot;), &quot;La Blue Girl&quot; features a large amount of tentacle rape. It departs somewhat from its predecessors, however, by lightening the atmosphere with humor, lightly parodying the &quot;tentacle hentai&quot; genre.

An immensely successful series, &quot;La Blue Girl&quot; has inspired, over the years, several OVA series for a total of 14 episodes, a comic book adaptation, three live action movies, some PC games and some art books.

==Story==
The story involves various ninja clans in a constant state of war with one another. The female protagonist is Miko Mido, a young ninja-in-training and the next leader of the Miroku ninja clan. This clan has control over the Shikima, a perverted race of sex-hungry demons led by Miko&#x27;s father, the Shikima Lord. However, when thieves steal the magic compact that grants the clan this power, Miko has to fight the Shikima, utilizing her &quot;sexcraft&quot; ninjutsu in order to save the world. The Shikima live in a parallel dimension called the Shikima Realm, and one must perform specific sexual rituals in order to travel there.

==Characters==
:
:Miko is the heroine of all &quot;La Blue Girl&quot; OVAs and a kunoichi. She is the last descendant of the Miroku kunoichi clan, which has been feuding with the Suzuka clan for many generations. She is often very annoyed at being a sex ninja and having to use her body as a weapon against opponents. Miko can use many unusual sexual techniques, such as hardening her pubic hair into needles and firing them at an opponent, or the &#x27;Nyoninboh&#x27; technique which allows her to swell her clitoris to the size of a man&#x27;s penis and use it to arouse the passions of her female rivals. If strands of her hair are torn out, she can use them as acupuncture needles to stimulate her opponent&#x27;s erotic pleasure points. Her most powerful attack is the &#x27;Aoi Tatsumaki&#x27; (Blue Whirlwind), in which her hair turns into a giant blue tornado that invariably rips away all of her clothing (although most of her clothing is invariably in tatters by the time she employs this climactic tactic anyway). Miko is the daughter of Seikima, the King of the Shikima, and of Maria, the Queen, who is human and a former Miroku woman. As such, Miko is a demon-half-breed and has the blue-colored blood of the Shikima, hence the title &quot;La Blue Girl&quot;.
:
:Nin-Nin is a dwarf ninja who is always hooded. He is Miko&#x27;s loyal, yet sexually perverted, companion and sidekick. He likes to peep when Miko is bathing or masturbating and beams with joy whenever he can see her naked, barely dressed, or in any troublesome sexual encounter with demons or other ninja. On the other hand, he takes seriously to heart his role as Miko&#x27;s protector and always try to help her out whenever she is in trouble, or at least whenever he is not busy taping her &quot;exploits&quot; for future reference.
:
:A self-made ninja, Fubuki Kai sees Miko Mido as her adversary, as she wishes to prove that she is more talented than her, and more worthy of the title of headmaster of the Miroku ninja clan. After she is defeated by Miko in a sexual duel, however, she is adopted by the Shikima and becomes a friend of Miko. When adopted by the Shikima, she metamorphoses into a Shikima, since she desired enough power to equal Miko Mido. She is fond of her new form, but also irritates Miko by being better than her.
:
:Yaku is another ninja of the Miroku clan, whom Miko meets when she decides to travel to the secret Miroku village. She is the only survivor (with Miko) of the Miroku massacre caused by Kamiri and Kugutsumen. Yaku is a powerful—and potentially very threatening—girl, for she shapeshifts into a werewolf unless she reaches an orgasm in time. Her most notable other attributes are her large breasts, of which Miko is envious.

;Kamiri
:Kamiri was at one time the Miroku clan&#x27;s sexcraft instructor, but she was banished by the clan for treachery because she became the lover of the renegade ninja Kugutsumen. Before being driven away, she was also punished by being raped with a thorny phallus that mangled her vagina. As a result, she swore to take vengeance on the Miroku clan. When Kamiri returns and steals the Miroku treasure, the magical sword Jipang, its evil spirit possesses her and makes her want to conquer the Shikima Realm, kill King Seikima, and rule over it. For that she needs Miko, who is the only one who knows how to get there. After several fights between Kamiri, Miko and Yaku, Kamiri is destroyed by the evil spirit of Jipang.

;Kugutsumen
:A renegade ninja of the Suzuka clan who became the lover of Kamiri, the Miroku sexcraft instructor, after he was able to take control of her when a drop of his semen entered her body during a fight. It was he who killed all the Miroku ninja by mangling their vaginas and causing fatal hemorrhages, mimicking their punishment of his lover. Because of her wounds and her possession by Jipang&#x27;s evil spirit, Kamiri refuses to have sex with him and so he rapes several young girls. He is a tough opponent for Miko and Yaku, for he often tricks them by disguising himself and so lures them into his traps.

;Various Shikima and tentacled monsters
:The monsters, who generally have irregular and grotesque shapes, try to make the women reach orgasm, to kill the women, or both, depending on the monsters&#x27; various agendas and natures (one poltergeist is depicted in the manga as merging with a kappa in order to heal himself after being defeated by Miko and Nin-Nin and thus get revenge against Miko; the Shikima King is said to be Miko&#x27;s father, but a Shikima curse leads to her being violated anyhow, as two examples).
:
:An older sister of Miko and a drama actress, she was kidnapped by the demons from the Shikima World and was rescued by her sister. It is revealed that Miyu was not born of a Shikima but of a human, born through the joining of a member of the Suzuka clan; this disqualified Maria of holding the title of chief of the Miroku clan and, thus, she was driven away, while Miko was given to her grandmother for a proper raising and training.
:Introduced in the third episode of &quot;La Blue Girl Returns&quot;, Kanako is a student at a nursing college. Before her grandmother died, she had trained Kanako in the carnal arts in order to offer her services to Miko Mido and the Miroku clan. It then became her dream to be summoned by Miko, and she developed a crush on her. She got in touch with the other main characters through a website posted by Fubuki in their search for more members of the Miroku clan.
:The leader of the Mahoroba clan.

;Rokuga
:Another member of the Mahoroba clan. Posing as Miyu&#x27;s new boyfriend, he succeeds in stealing the Shikima seal case.
:Miko&#x27;s classmate.
:Ruri&#x27;s brother, introduced in the third episode. It is love at first sight between him and Miko, but she continually dreams of him wearing a strange outfit, a hint that they were lovers in the past.

==Original video animation (OVA)==
===&quot;La Blue Girl&quot;===
Injū Gakuen / La Blue Girl (four episodes, 1992–93) is an adaptation of the original manga. Miko Mido is a teenage girl who is to be the next leader of the ancestral Miroku ninja clan. But the Suzuka clan steals the treasured compact that symbolizes the truce between the Miroku and the Shikima, a race of perverted otherworldly demons, and soon Miko has to use the sexual techniques of the Miroku to survive the assaults of the demons and protect her sister. After learning the truth behind her heritage and the identity of her true parents, she embarks on a journey to become a real Miroku ninja and would have to fight an ex-mistress-turned-traitor of the Miroku clan.
===&quot;New La Blue Girl&quot;===
Shin Injū Gakuen / New La Blue Girl (two episodes, 1993) adapts the end of the manga, and as such is a follow-up and the conclusion to Miko&#x27;s adventures in the first series. This time the enemies are Fubuki Kai, a rogue ninja who wants to defeat Miko and claim the title of best ninja, and the cybernetized survivors of the Suzuka clan.

La Blue Girl 6 was initially released on VHS in two 30-minute long semi-episodes, while later releases (including the licensed English one) combine them into an hour long episode.

===&quot;Lady Blue&quot;===
 a.k.a. &quot;Lady Blue&quot; (four episodes, 1994). Features an original story about two ghosts, Kyoshiro and Shanahime, harboring an old grudge against the Shikima and attacking several of Miko&#x27;s friends, including her first love.
&quot;Lady Blue&quot; is about Miko&#x27;s first love. Miko meets a young man named Hidemasa outside her apartment building and falls in love at first sight. Just when Miko thinks she can finally live like a normal girl and enjoy being in love, a mysterious female phantom appears in her school, sucking the life out of Miko&#x27;s pretty young schoolmates. Fubuki reports that something is very wrong in the Shikima realm. Miko&#x27;s parents are being tortured by the sound of flutes playing and no one knows why.

Miko and Fubuki investigate and find out that there is actually a love story behind it all, for the flutes belonged to a betrothed couple (Kyoshiro and Shanahime) 400 years ago, but treachery got in the way, so their love was never realized. The flutes are now cursed and Miko&#x27;s dream guy, Hidemasa, is kidnapped by the vengeful phantom of Shanahime in order to resurrect her Kyoshiro.

====Compilation episodes====
The first was a 90 minute compilation video of the first 4 episodes titled &#x27;Climax Taizen&#x27;, a 60 minute compilation video of the &#x27;Shin&#x27; series titled &#x27;Ecstasy Taizen&#x27; and a 60 minute compilation video of the &#x27;EX&#x27; series.

Included in the &#x27;Injuu Gakuen La☆Blue Girl Memorial Collection&#x27; LD-Box set.

===&quot;La Blue Girl Returns&quot;===
 a.k.a. &quot;La Blue Girl Returns&quot; (four episodes, 2001) is an anime series that continues the adventures of Miko Mido. Another original story, this time about the legendary Shikima Brain, a place rumored to bring total power over the universe. It is coveted by the insectoid ninja clan of the Mahoroba and protected by a mysterious clan, who may have a relation with Miko&#x27;s previous life.

The plot begins when a race of butterfly-like demons named the Mahoroba want to enslave Miko Mido and her sister to steal the seal case that controls the Shikima. Their ultimate goal is to conquer the Shikima Brain, a legendary place of the Shikima realm which is said to confer the power to rule the universe.
===Censorship issues===
Censorship is practiced differently both in Japan and in the U.S. due to their different laws: Japanese law technically discourages showing of genital hair or explicit genitalia, while the United States is more concerned about forbidding the display of sexual acts involving people under 18. Hence, there are censoring mosaics in Japan and scene removals and different ages of characters in the U.S.

While not featuring the censoring mosaics of the original Japanese version, the U.S. release of &quot;La Blue Girl&quot; was edited during the initial VHS release and all scenes featuring Miko&#x27;s companion Nin-Nin engaged in a sexual act were removed, probably to avoid the charge of hebephilia.

For similar reasons, the age of the heroine was also altered: initially stated to be a 16-year-old high-schooler in the original Japanese version, she is an 18-year-old college student in the U.S. version. The various U.S. DVD releases contain this edited version.

In the U.K., the British Board of Film Classification refused to give it a certificate; meaning it was banned from release in the region.

*&quot;La Blue Girl&quot;, a U.S. comic book by Matt Lunsford and José Calderon. It has the distinction of retelling the two distinctly separate story arcs of the first four episodes of the first anime series by merging them together, albeit with story changes to the plots of episodes 2 to 4. Whereas Toshio Maeda&#x27;s manga established him to be a young Shikima demon able to transform into an adult form, the U.S. series reveals that he is a product of his human mother&#x27;s rape by a Shikima, that she died giving birth to him, and that his dual heritage resulted in his deformed face, which is shown unmasked.

==Video games==
*&quot;La Blue Girl&quot; for NEC PC-9801 and FM-Towns, featuring a different character design from the manga and the anime. The story is an adaptation of both the first volume of the manga and OVA: Miko&#x27;s friends at school are assaulted by demons and her professor is kidnapped and sent to their infernal dimension; Miko travels there and saves her; everyone goes back to Earth, where a final showdown is awaiting Miko at school. Gameplay-wise, it is a &quot;digital comics&quot; adventure game with some shooting phases (in a &quot;Snatcher&quot; fashion, and with shuriken instead of a pistol).
*&quot;La Blue Girl&quot; for Windows 95. The art is more faithful to the anime character design, while the story is an adaptation of the &quot;La Blue Girl EX&quot; OVA.

<text>USS &quot;Saint Paul&quot; (CA-73), a &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruiser, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Her keel was laid down as Rochester on 3 February 1943 by the Bethlehem Steel Company in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 16 September 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Marie Gordon McDonough, wife of John J. McDonough, then mayor of Saint Paul; and commissioned on 17 February 1945, Captain Ernest H. von Heimburg in command.
She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1978, and was sold for scrapping in January 1980.

==Service history==

===World War II===
After shakedown in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 15 May 1945 and headed for the Pacific. From 8–30 June, she underwent training out of Pearl Harbor and sailed on 2 July to join Task Force 38 (TF 38). This fast carrier striking force completed replenishment at sea on 23 July and then proceeded to launching points for strikes against Honshū, Japan&#x27;s largest island. From 24 July to 10 August, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; screened the carriers as they delivered heavy air strikes on Kure, Kobe, and the Tokyo area in southern Honshū, then at Maizuru and various airfields in northern Honshū. During this period, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; also bombarded industrial targets: first on textile mills at Hamamatsu during the night of 29 July, and then on 9 August at iron and steel works in Kamaishi, firing the war&#x27;s last hostile salvo from a major ship. Typhoon warnings canceled air operations from 11 to 14 August. Then, those launched that morning were recalled, after peace negotiations gave promise of Japan&#x27;s surrender. On 15 August, all offensive operations against Japan were stopped.

&quot;Saint Paul&quot;, with other units of the Third Fleet, retired to the southeast to patrol the coast while awaiting orders. On 27 August, she steamed into Sagami Wan to support United States occupation forces. On 1 September, she entered Tokyo Bay and was there during the formal surrender ceremony the next day.

===Post-World War II===
&quot;Saint Paul&quot; remained in Japanese waters for occupation duty until she was ordered to Shanghai on 5 November to become flagship of TF 73. She navigated the Huangpu River, anchored off the Shanghai Bund on 10 November; she remained there until early in 1946. On 21 December 1945 she was in collision with the Chinese (ex-Japanese) landing craft &quot;LST144&quot;, which was driven against the bow of &quot;Saint Paul&quot; by the force of the current. The landing craft sustained severe damage, the cruiser slight damage to the bow area.

On 7 January 1946, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; departed Shanghai in company with and returned to the Naval Shipyard, Terminal Island, California, on 28 January 1946 for a brief refit to make good the collision damage. In May, the ship made a round trip to Pearl Harbor. Returning to Terminal Island on 1 August, she was overhauled to prepare for additional Far East duty. From 1–15 February 1947, she conducted refresher training at San Diego, California.

Following her return to Shanghai in March, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; resumed operations as flagship for TF 71 until returning to the United States in November. Next, came training operations along the West Coast, including cruises for Naval Reservists from April–May. From August–December, she deployed to the western Pacific, serving in Japanese and Chinese waters. Back in the United States, she was converted from catapult to helicopter configuration before serving again in the Far East from April through October 1949.

===Korean War===


When hostilities broke out in the Korean War in June 1950, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was conducting a midshipman training cruise from San Francisco, California, to Pearl Harbor. She disembarked the future naval officers and proceeded late in July to the western Pacific where she joined Task Group 77.3 (TG 77.3) on patrol in the Formosa Strait. &quot;Saint Paul&quot; remained on patrol between Formosa and mainland China from 27 August to 1 November. She then moved north into the Sea of Japan to join TF 77, and commenced combat operations off the northeast coast of Korea on 9 November. On 17 November, she provided gunfire support to the United Nations troops advancing on Chongjin. That day, shrapnel from a near miss by a shell from a Communist shore battery injured six men at gun mount stations. The cruiser destroyed the enemy emplacement with counter-battery fire and continued her support mission.

As the Chinese Communists began massive attacks late in November, United Nations forces commenced a general withdrawal to consolidate and hold south of the 38th parallel. &quot;Saint Paul&quot; provided close support for the Republic of Korea I Corps on their east flank as they withdrew from Hapsu, and along the coast, as they retired from Chongjin. On 2 December, she moved north again, conducted night harassing missions above Chongjin, then moved south to support the withdrawal of the Republic of Korea Capital Division to Kyongsong Man. She entered the harbor at Wonsan on 3 December to provide a curtain of shellfire around that city as United Nations forces and equipment were moved to Hungnam; then followed the forces there, and remained to cover the evacuation of that city and harbor between 10 December and 24 December. (The now restored SS &quot;Lane Victory&quot; was one of the ships protected by her cover fire.)

From 21 to 31 January 1951, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; conducted shore bombardment missions north of Inchon where, on 26 January, she was again fired upon by shore batteries. On 7 April, in TF 74, with , , and , &quot;Saint Paul&quot; helped to carry out raids on rail lines and tunnels utilizing 250 commandos of the 41st Independent Royal Marines. These highly successful destructive raids slowed down the enemy&#x27;s resupply efforts, forcing the Communists to attempt to repair or rebuild the rail facilities by night while hiding the work crews and locomotives in tunnels by day.

&quot;Saint Paul&quot; returned to the United States for yard work at San Francisco, California, from June to September, then conducted underway training before sailing on 5 November for Korea. She arrived off Wonsan on 27 November and commenced gun strike missions in support of the UN blockade. During the following weeks, she bombarded strategic points at Hungnam, Songjin, and Chongjin. In December, she served as an antiaircraft escort for TF 77, and, following a holiday trip to Japan, returned to operations off the coast of North Korea. In April 1952, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; participated in combined air-sea attacks against the ports of Wonsan and Chongjin.

On 21 April, while the cruiser was engaged in gun fire support operations, a sudden and serious powder fire broke out in her forward turret. Thirty men died. The explosion occurred in the turret&#x27;s left gun, which was loaded but had the breech open. The gun captain thought the weapon had fired and told the gun&#x27;s rammerman to ram another projectile into the gun&#x27;s breech. The gun blew up, setting off two other powder bags in the powder hoist.

Before returning to Japan for repairs, however, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; carried out gunstrikes on railroad targets near Songjin, during which she captured nine North Koreans from a small boat. Following a brief stay in port and two weeks on the gun line, she headed home and reached Long Beach, California, on 24 June.

On 28 February 1953, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; departed the West Coast for her third Korean tour and was in action again by April. In mid-June, she assisted in the recapture of Anchor Hill. With , she provided close support to the Korean Army in a ground assault on this key position south of Kosong. The cruiser was fired upon many times by 75 mm and 105 mm guns, and observed numerous near misses, some only ten yards away. But on 11 July at Wonsan, she received her only direct hit from a shore battery. No one was wounded, and only her antiaircraft mount was damaged. On 27 July, at 2159, she conducted her last gunstrike and had the distinction of firing the last round shot at sea in the war. The shell, autographed by Rear Admiral Harry Sanders, was fired at an enemy gun emplacement. The truce was effective at 2200. &quot;Saint Paul&quot; then commenced patrol duties along the east coast of Korea.

===Post-Korea===
&quot;Saint Paul&quot; returned to the western Pacific again in May 1954; and, later that year, she was on hand when the Chinese Communists were threatening the Nationalist Chinese islands of the Quemoy Islands group. From 19 November 1954 to 12 July 1955, she operated with the 7th Fleet in Japanese and Chinese waters, particularly between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, playing a major role in protecting United States interests in the Far East. She returned to Long Beach, California, for repairs and an overhaul which included enclosing the command and flag bridge levels. Following this work she was back in the western Pacific from 15 August 1955 to 10 January 1956 serving as flagship for the 7th Fleet.

&quot;Saint Paul&quot; returned to Long Beach, California, in February and subsequently moved to Bremerton, Washington, for upkeep and overhaul. This overhaul period included removing the forward 5&quot; gun turret and adding a large deck house between the funnels to accommodate enhanced flagship facilities. This work was completed by late summer, and in September, she became flagship for the 1st Fleet and entertained the Secretary of the Navy during a fleet review at Long Beach. She departed that port on 6 November; and, after refresher training at San Diego, California, arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 29 September to relieve as 7th Fleet flagship. She spent most of her time in Keelung or Kaohsiung, Taiwan, with periods of training in the Philippines and port calls at Buckner Bay, Hong Kong, Manila, and Sasebo. On 26 April 1957, she headed home.

&quot;Saint Paul&quot; arrived at Long Beach, California, on 21 May and subsequently cruised along the West Coast, as far north as Seattle, Washington, until she sailed once more on 3 February 1958 for the Far East. She made an extensive cruise beginning at Pearl Harbor. Thence she steamed to Wellington, New Zealand; proceeded past Guadalcanal and north through the Solomon Islands to New Georgia; visited the Caroline Islands; and ended at Yokosuka on 9 March. She repeated her past WestPac deployments with duties as flagship, and exercises in the Philippines, before returning to Long Beach on 25 August for maintenance and upkeep. Sailing from Long Beach, California, on 4 May 1959, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; became the first major United States Navy ship to be homeported in the Far East since before World War II. Based at Yokosuka, she did not return to Long Beach until 39 months later.

In late 1963 through summer 1964, as one of the only World War II cruisers still in commission and still in her wartime all-gun configuration (several others were in commission, but had been extensively modernized into guided missile cruisers), &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was extensively used in the filming of the motion picture &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;, starring John Wayne. In the movie, it is apparent that the ship has been slightly modified according to the standard of the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class - the front 5-inch cannon turret has been removed, leading to the larger gap between the bridge and second 8-inch turret, so in the movie the cruiser no longer has 12 5-inch guns, but only 10 5-inch guns. In addition, her original 40mm quadruple turrets had been replaced with 3-inch twin turrets. The ship was never mentioned by her actual name (her large hull number on the bow was painted over), but was simply referred to as &quot;Old Swayback&quot; and was supposedly commanded by Wayne&#x27;s character as a captain, served as his flagship as a rear admiral, and was later sunk during a crucial battle with the Japanese.

After her movie filming stint was over, she assumed duties as 1st Fleet flagship and did not return to WestPac until 1966. From that year, she made five successful deployments with the 7th Fleet in operations off North and South Vietnam, providing gunfire support to allied troops. Reminiscent of her Korean operations, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was hit on 1 September 1967 by a shell which struck her starboard bow, near the water line. None of her crew was injured; and her engineers repaired the slight damage, enabling her to continue her mission. For her service, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; earned the Navy Unit Commendation and two Meritorious Unit Commendations.

At San Diego, California on 7 December 1970, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; began inactivation procedures. She sailed to Bremerton, Washington, on 1 February 1971, where she was decommissioned on 30 April after 26 continuous years of active service to her country, and was placed in reserve with the Puget Sound Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Saint Paul&quot; was the last all-gun &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruiser in US Navy service while and soldiered on until 1980 as &quot;Albany&quot;-class guided missile cruisers.

Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1978, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was sold for scrapping in January 1980.

&quot;Saint Paul&quot;″s ship&#x27;s bell is now displayed in Saint Paul City Hall on the third floor between the city council and mayoral offices, in an area also containing a listing of the United States Naval Reserve personnel from Saint Paul who served aboard the destroyer when she fired the first American shots of World War II.

<doc id="496352" wikidata="Q270975" url="?curid=496352" title="Rasheed Wallace">
<text>Rasheed Abdul Wallace (born September 17, 1974) is an American basketball coach and former professional player. A native of Philadelphia, Wallace played college basketball at the University of North Carolina before declaring for the draft in 1995. He played 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Originally selected by the Washington Bullets (now known as the Washington Wizards) as the fourth pick in the 1995 NBA draft, Wallace was named to the All-Rookie second team following his first season. He was then traded to the Portland Trail Blazers after the season. He was a key member of the Trail Blazers team that made it to the Western Conference Finals in 1999 and 2000, and he was an NBA All-Star in 2000 and 2001. Wallace averaged a career best 19.4 points per game in 2002 for the Trail Blazers.

During the 2003–04 season Portland traded him to the Atlanta Hawks where he played one game before he was traded to the Detroit Pistons. With the Pistons, Wallace won the NBA championship in 2004 and reached the NBA Finals in the following season before losing to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. Individually, Wallace was an NBA All-Star in 2006 and 2008. After the 2008–09 season, Wallace left the Pistons as a free agent and signed with the Boston Celtics, where he played until retiring in 2010. He returned to sign a one-year deal to play for the New York Knicks in 2012. On April 17, 2013, Wallace announced his second retirement.

Wallace holds the single-season record for technical fouls. In the 2000–01 season, Wallace received 41 technical fouls over 80 games. He has received the third-most career technical fouls with 317, and he holds the NBA record for most career ejections with 29.

==Early life and education==
Wallace was born and raised as the youngest of three sons of a single-mother household in the neighborhood of Germantown, Philadelphia. His mother worked in the Pennsylvania Department of Welfare; Wallace, his mother, and his brothers Malcolm and Muhammed lived in Germantown.

Wallace began his basketball career while attending Simon Gratz High School. He was named USA Today&#x27;s High School Player of the Year after his senior season and was selected first-team All America by Basketball Times. Wallace was also a two-time Parade All-American first teamer. Despite playing just 19 minutes per game, Wallace averaged 16 points, 15 rebounds and seven blocks his senior year. In addition to basketball, Wallace played baseball, ran track and high jumped as a teenager. He played in the Roundball Classic, scoring 30 points in a losing effort. Wallace, along with Randy Livingston and Jerry Stackhouse, were considered the top three players in the 1993 class.

==College career==
University of North Carolina coach Dean Smith recruited Wallace to Chapel Hill, North Carolina for his college years. Smith was a revered mentor both to Wallace and Wallace&#x27;s eventual Detroit coach Larry Brown. Wallace has indicated that this North Carolina bond with Brown helped him adjust quickly to the Pistons system. During his two years at North Carolina, Wallace had success in the national spotlight. He was named a second-team All-American by the AP his second year at UNC.

Wallace and fellow future NBA player Jerry Stackhouse helped lead the Tar Heels to the NCAA Final Four in 1995. He left North Carolina to enter the 1995 NBA draft after his sophomore season, being selected with the fourth pick overall by the Washington Bullets.

==Professional career==

===Washington Bullets (1995–1996)===
As a rookie with the Bullets, Wallace played in 65 games, of which he started 51 for the injured Chris Webber. Wallace was selected to the rookie team for the All-Star Weekend. Late that year, he fractured his left thumb during a game against Orlando and did not return until the following season. En route to being named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team, Wallace averaged 10.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 3.4 assists. In total, Wallace scored 655 points and played 1,788 minutes during his rookie season in Washington.

===Portland Trail Blazers (1996–2004)===
After the season, Wallace was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, along with Mitchell Butler in exchange for Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant. This move proved beneficial for both sides: Strickland averaged 17.2 ppg and 8.9 apg after the trade, helping the Bullets make the playoffs in 1997 for the first time in eight seasons, and upped those stats to 17.8 ppg and a league-leading 10.5 apg the following year.

Meanwhile, Wallace ranked third in the league in field goal percentage. However, just as his season was gaining momentum, Wallace again broke his left thumb and was forced to miss the next month of the season, but he returned in time for a strong performance in the first round playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers, which the Trail Blazers lost.

Next season, Wallace signed a long-term contract to stay with the Trail Blazers. He began extending himself into the community more than ever, most notably with his Rasheed Wallace Foundation, but his career suffered from numerous missteps on and off the court. He set an NBA record with 38 technical fouls for the season. However, he would be fifth in the league in field goal percentage. The following year, he broke his own record with 40 technicals. Wallace was also suspended by the NBA for seven games for threatening then-referee Tim Donaghy on an arena loading dock after a home game in 2003. That was the league&#x27;s longest suspension for an offense that did not involve violence or substance abuse. Wallace was far from the only perceived trouble maker on Portland at the time, his teammates, Bonzi Wells, Damon Stoudamire, and Zach Randolph for instance, were also frequently criticized by media and fans for off-court outbursts and legal incidents, leading to the team often being referred to as &quot;The Jail Blazers&quot;.

Wallace was named an NBA All-Star in 2000 and 2001. On February 20, 2001, he scored a career best 42 points in a 104–94 victory over the Denver Nuggets. In the postseason, Wallace led the Trail Blazers to the Western Conference Finals back to back in 1999 and 2000, losing to the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers, respectively. Both teams would go on to win the NBA Finals. The 2000 series against the Lakers was alleged by some to have one-sided officiating in favor of the Lakers, with the Trail Blazers squandering a 15-point lead going into the fourth quarter of Game 7. Two years later, during the 2002 NBA Playoffs, despite Wallace posting career high postseason averages of 25.3 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, Portland was again eliminated by the eventual champion Lakers.

===Atlanta Hawks (2004)===

On February 9, 2004, just before the 2004 NBA All-Star Game, Wallace was traded to the Atlanta Hawks along with Wesley Person for Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Theo Ratliff and Dan Dickau. Wallace played only one game for the Hawks, on February 18, scoring 20 points through three quarters. He also had six rebounds, five blocks, two assists and a steal in a close loss on the road against the New Jersey Nets, though he did not score in the fourth quarter.

=== Detroit Pistons (2004–2009) ===
==== Championship and consecutive Finals appearances (2004–2005) ====
Wallace was again traded, in a deal that saw him go from the Hawks along with guard Mike James from the Celtics to the Detroit Pistons. In turn, Detroit sent guards Chucky Atkins, Lindsey Hunter and a first-round draft pick to Boston and guard Bob Sura, center Željko Rebrača and a first-round draft pick to Atlanta. Boston also sent forward Chris Mills to Atlanta to complete the deal.

On February 23, 2004, in his first road game with the Pistons, Wallace recorded 10 points, 11 rebounds and 4 blocks in a 76–66 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.

After falling behind against the Indiana Pacers in the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals, he stated boldly in an interview that &quot;We will win Game 2,&quot; a promise he helped fulfill.

In Game 4 of the 2004 NBA Finals, Wallace recorded 26 points, 13 rebounds and 2 assists in an 88–80 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The Detroit Pistons were up 3–1 in that occasion. Wallace helped the Pistons win an unexpected NBA title, beating the heavily favored Lakers four games to one. After the championship season, he paid for replica WWE World Heavyweight Championship belts to be made for each of his teammates and presented them as gifts when the 2004–05 regular season started.

In the off-season following the Pistons&#x27; championship win, Wallace signed a five-year, $57 million contract to remain with Detroit. He also changed the number of his jersey from #30 to #36.

Throughout the 2004–05 season, Wallace often carried the belt into his locker before games to inspire the Pistons&#x27; title defense. However, early in the season, the Pistons had a fight with the Indiana Pacers, which resulted into several suspensions for players putting the team into a temporary setback.

Several months later, he had several notable moments in the playoffs. After the second-round elimination of the Pacers, Wallace played his best series of the postseason in the Eastern Conference finals against the top-seeded Miami Heat. After falling behind again, he again &quot;guaranteed success&quot;. He shot a 50% field goal percentage and averaged 14.5 points per game in the series&#x27; seven games, and saved his hottest-shooting night to help the Pistons beat the Heat 88–82 in Game 7 on the road in Miami. Against the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals, Wallace was criticized for leaving Robert Horry open for the game-winning three-pointer in Game 5. Wallace&#x27;s defense and clutch shooting helped the Pistons to split the series 3–3, but in the final game, the Pistons lost 81–74.

==== All-Star appearances and final years in Detroit (2005–2009) ====
In the 2005–06 season, he helped lead them to a 64–18 record, and the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the playoffs. The Pistons beat the Milwaukee Bucks, 4–1 in the first round and then beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–3 in the second round of the playoffs. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons played the Heat in a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s Conference Finals. The Pistons lost in six games to the Miami Heat, who went on to capture their first NBA title.

On March 26, 2007, in a game against the Denver Nuggets, Wallace threw up a 60-foot shot off a stolen inbound pass with 1.5 seconds remaining and banked it in from just behind halfcourt to force overtime letting out a huge roar from what was left of the Palace crowd. The Pistons went on to win the game, 113–109.

On June 2, 2007, Wallace fouled out of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals after committing a foul on LeBron James and then received two technical fouls, resulting in an automatic ejection, for arguing with a referee.

Prior to the 2007–08 NBA season, the Pistons would not re-sign Chris Webber, and putting Antonio McDyess as a starting power forward, put Wallace at center. On February 10, 2008, it was announced that Wallace would be replacing Boston Celtics&#x27; injured forward Kevin Garnett in the 2008 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans. The decision was made by NBA commissioner David Stern. This was Wallace&#x27;s fourth All-Star appearance.

In the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons played Garnett and the Celtics. This marked the sixth consecutive time that the Pistons had made it to this point, and five times they had gotten there with Wallace in the lineup. Still, Detroit lost a third consecutive year in the Conference Finals, losing to Boston 4–2 as Wallace played poorly. After the game, Wallace reportedly told reporters, without taking any questions, &quot;It&#x27;s over, man&quot;, perhaps indicating that Pistons&#x27; General Manager Joe Dumars would break up the core of the team following the defeat. He changed his number from 36 back to his original 30, perhaps to change his and the team&#x27;s fortunes, but sure enough, Dumars did indeed break up the core: at the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Dumars traded longtime starting point guard and 2004 Finals MVP Chauncey Billups to Denver. It was to be Wallace&#x27;s last year with the team; after the season came to a close, Wallace and the Pistons decided to part ways.

===Boston Celtics (2009–2010)===
Wallace signed a three-year contract with the Boston Celtics on July 8, 2009. During the regular season, Wallace struggled, averaging career lows in points per game and rebounds per game in addition to shooting only 28% on three-pointers and 40% from the field. The Celtics reached the NBA Finals in 2010 but lost the series to the Los Angeles Lakers four games to three. In Game 6 of the Finals, the Celtics&#x27; starting center Kendrick Perkins injured his right knee, so Wallace started Game 7. Wallace scored 11 points and was 5 of 11 from the field in the loss. Wallace&#x27;s agent Bill Strickland announced on June 25, 2010, that Wallace would likely retire from the NBA, which was made official on August 10, following the buyout of his contract by the Celtics.

===New York Knicks (2012–2013)===
On October 3, 2012, Wallace came out of retirement, and signed with the New York Knicks.

On February 27, 2013, Wallace announced that he had a broken left foot and was expected to miss eight weeks. He was scheduled for surgery. He returned for a final game on April 15, 2013, playing three minutes off the bench. On April 17, 2013, after a short return, Wallace announced his second retirement.

==Coaching career==

===Detroit Pistons===

In July 2013, Wallace joined the Detroit Pistons staff as an assistant coach after signing a two-year contract with the team. He worked for the Pistons for the 2013–14 season, but was not rehired to the staff of new coach Stan Van Gundy following that season.

===Jordan High School===
On March 8, 2019, Wallace was introduced as the new boys varsity basketball head coach at Charles E. Jordan High School in Durham, North Carolina.

===Memphis Tigers===
On August 18, 2021, Wallace agreed to become an assistant coach at Memphis on Penny Hardaway&#x27;s staff roster. He joined his former head coach in Detroit and Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown on the Tigers. On January 13, 2022, it was announced that Wallace would not serve an in-person role but would finish the season working remotely.

==On-court moments==

Wallace was known for his intensity and expressive personality, resulting in frequent confrontations with opponents and officials (often leading to technical fouls and ejections) but also moments of humor. Wallace holds the league records for most technical fouls in a season, and most ejections in a season; he also holds the league record for most career ejections with 29. During the 2008 Playoffs, Wallace went on an expletive-laced tirade following Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics in which he lashed out at the officiating.

Wallace popularized the phrase &quot;Ball don&#x27;t lie&quot;, used when a player on the opposing team misses a free throw after a contentious call by the referees. One notable incident occurred in a December 2, 2012 game against the Phoenix Suns. After Wallace pushed Luis Scola and received a technical foul, Goran Dragić missed the technical free throw, to which Wallace responded by saying &quot;Ball don&#x27;t lie.&quot; Wallace then received a second technical, leading to his ejection. He played 1:25 before his ejection.

During the 2010 NBA Playoffs Wallace, a native of Philadelphia and Flyers fan, frequently wore hats and other articles of clothing with the Philadelphia Flyers logo during Boston Celtics press conferences and interviews. This caused a stir with fans throughout the Boston area as the Flyers were playing the Boston Bruins in the NHL Playoffs at the time. Criticism by Bostonians only grew after the Flyers&#x27; comeback from a 0–3 game deficit to win the series 4–3. Wallace nevertheless continued to wear his Flyers gear in public.

==Personal life==
Wallace has three children with his former wife Fatima Sanders. He is a follower of Islam. His nephew, Quadir Welton, is a professional basketball player.

Wallace roots for his hometown Philadelphia Flyers (NHL) and Phillies (MLB), but not the Eagles of the NFL. Instead, he is a longtime fan of the Kansas City Chiefs.

===Activism and philanthropy===
Wallace has been one of the biggest voices and helping hands in the Flint water crisis. He personally delivered water door to door in Flint since the summer of 2016; he wrote a letter (a short article) in the Players Tribune to raise awareness. He also appeared on the television show Area 21 to talk about the Crisis. Wallace&#x27;s efforts inspired Stephen Jackson, Rachel Nichols, Kyle Kuzma, and other celebrities to help in Flint.

<doc id="496354" wikidata="Q213651" url="?curid=496354" title="Gandhara">
<text>Gandhara () was an ancient Indo-Aryan region in present-day north-west Pakistan and north-east Afghanistan. The core of the region of Gandhara was the Peshawar and Swat valleys extending as far east as the Pothohar Plateau in Punjab, though the cultural influence of Greater Gandhara extended westwards into the Kabul valley in Afghanistan, and northwards up to the Karakoram range. The region was a central location for the spread of Buddhism to Central Asia and East Asia with many Chinese Buddhist pilgrims visiting the region.

Between the third century BCE and third century CE, Gāndhārī, a Middle Indo-Aryan language written in the Kharosthi script, acted as the lingua franca of the region and through Buddhism, the language spread as far as China based on Gandhāran Buddhist texts. Famed for its unique Gandharan style of art, the region attained its height from the 1st century to the 5th century CE under the Kushan Empire which had their capital at Puruṣapura, ushering the period known as &quot;Pax Kushana.&quot;

The history of Gandhara originates with the Gandhara grave culture, characterized by a distinctive burial practice. During the Vedic period Gandhara gained recognition as one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas, or &#x27;great realms&#x27;, within South Asia playing a role in the Kurukshetra War. In the 6th century BCE, King Pukkusāti governed the region and was most notable for defeating the Kingdom of Avanti though Gandhara eventually succumbed as a tributary to the Achaemenids. During the Wars of Alexander the Great, the region was split into two factions with Taxiles, the king of Taxila, allying with Alexander the Great, while the Western Gandharan tribes, exemplified by the Aśvaka around the Swat valley, resisted. Following the Macedonian downfall, Gandhara became part of the Mauryan Empire with Chandragupta Maurya receiving an education in Taxila under Chanakya and later assumed control with his support. Subsequently, Gandhara was successively annexed by the Indo-Greeks, Indo-Scythians, and Indo-Parthians though a regional Gandharan kingdom, known as the Apracharajas, retained governance during this period until the ascent of the Kushan Empire. The zenith of Gandhara&#x27;s cultural and political influence transpired during Kushan rule, before succumbing to devastation during the Hunnic Invasions. However, the region experienced a resurgence under the Turk Shahis and Hindu Shahis.

==Etymology==

Gandhara was known in Sanskrit as Gandhāraḥ () and in Avestan as &#x27;. In Old Persian, Gandhara was known as Gadāra (𐎥𐎭𐎠𐎼, also transliterated as Gandāra since the nasal &quot;n&quot; before consonants were omitted in Old Persian). In Chinese, Gandhara is known as &quot;Jiāntuóluó&quot; (, also written ), with the Middle Chinese pronunciation reconstructed as &quot;kɨɐndala&quot;. One state of the region named &quot;Jìbīn&quot; (, also romanized as Kipin) is recorded in the Book of Han. In Greek, Gandhara was known as Paropamisadae.

One proposed origin of the name is from the Sanskrit word &quot;&quot; (), meaning &quot;perfume&quot; and &quot;referring to the spices and aromatic herbs which they (the inhabitants) traded and with which they anointed themselves&quot;. The Gandhari people are a tribe mentioned in the Rigveda, the Atharvaveda, and later Vedic texts.

A Persian form of the name, &quot;Gandara&quot;, mentioned in the Behistun inscription of Emperor Darius I, was translated as &quot;Paruparaesanna&quot; (&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;beyond the Hindu Kush&quot;) in Babylonian and Elamite in the same inscription.

== Geography ==
The geographical location of Gandhara has undergone alterations throughout history, with the general understanding being the region situating between Pothohar in contemporary Punjab, the Swat valley, and the Khyber Pass also extending along the Kabul River. The prominent urban centres within this geographical scope were Taxila and Pushkalavati. According to a specific Jataka, Gandhara&#x27;s territorial extent at a certain period encompassed the region of Kashmir. The Eastern border of Gandhara has been proposed to be the Jhelum River based on arachaeological Gandharan art discoveries however further evidence is needed to support this, though during the rule of Alexander the Great the kingdom of Taxila stretched to the Hydaspes (Jhelum river).

The term Greater Gandhara describes the cultural and linguistic extent of Gandhara and its language, Gandhari. In later historical contexts, Greater Gandhara encompassed the territories of Jibin and Oddiyana which had splintered from Gandhara proper and also extended into parts of Bactria and the Tarim Basin. Oddiyana was situated in the vicinity of the Swat valley, while Jibin corresponded to the region of Kapisa, south of the Hindu Kush. However during the 5th and 6th centuries CE, Jibin was often considered synonymous with Gandhara.

The Udichya region was another region mentioned in ancient texts and is noted by Pāṇini as comprising both the regions of Vahika and Gandhara.

==History==

=== Gandhāra grave culture ===
Gandhara&#x27;s first recorded culture was the Grave Culture that emerged and lasted until 800 BCE, and named for their distinct funerary practices. It was found along the Middle Swat River course, even though earlier research considered it to be expanded to the Valleys of Dir, Kunar, Chitral, and Peshawar. It has been regarded as a token of the Indo-Aryan migrations but has also been explained by local cultural continuity. Backwards projections, based on ancient DNA analyses, suggest ancestors of Swat culture people mixed with a population coming from Inner Asia Mountain Corridor, which carried Steppe ancestry, sometime between 1900 and 1500 BCE.

=== Vedic Gandhāra ===
According to Rigvedic tradition, Yayati was the progenitor of the prominent Udichya (Gandhara and Vahika tribes) and had numerous sons, including Anu, Puru, and Druhyu. The lineage of Anu gave rise to the Madra, Kekaya, Sivi and Uśīnara kingdoms, while the Druhyu tribe has been associated with the Gandhara kingdom.

The first mention of the Gandhārīs is attested once in the  as a tribe that has sheep with good wool. In the , the Gandhārīs are mentioned alongside the Mūjavants, the Āṅgeyas and the Māgadhīs in a hymn asking fever to leave the body of the sick man and instead go those aforementioned tribes. The tribes listed were the furthermost border tribes known to those in , the Āṅgeyas and Māgadhīs in the east, and the Mūjavants and Gandhārīs in the north. The &quot;Gandhara tribe&quot;, after which it is named, is attested in the Rigveda (), while the region is mentioned in the Zoroastrian Avesta as &quot;Vaēkərəta&quot;, the seventh most beautiful place on earth created by Ahura Mazda.

The Gāndhārī king Nagnajit and his son Svarajit are mentioned in the s, according to which they received Brahmanic consecration, but their family&#x27;s attitude towards ritual is mentioned negatively, with the royal family of Gandhāra during this period following non-Brahmanical religious traditions. According to the Jain , Nagnajit, or Naggaji, was a prominent king who had adopted Jainism and was comparable to Dvimukha of Pāñcāla, Nimi of Videha, Karakaṇḍu of Kaliṅga, and Bhīma of Vidarbha; Buddhist sources instead claim that he had achieved .

By the later Vedic period, the situation had changed, and the Gāndhārī capital of Takṣaśila had become an important centre of knowledge where the men of went to learn the three Vedas and the eighteen branches of knowledge, with the recording that s went north to study. According to the  and the , the famous Vedic philosopher Uddālaka Āruṇi was among the famous students of Takṣaśila, and the claims that his son Śvetaketu also studied there. In the , Uddālaka Āruṇi himself favourably referred to Gāndhārī education to the Vaideha king Janaka. During the 6th century BCE, Gandhāra was an important imperial power in north-west Iron Age South Asia, with the valley of Kaśmīra being part of the kingdom. Due to this important position, Buddhist texts listed the Gandhāra kingdom as one of the sixteen &quot;s&quot; (&quot;great realms&quot;) of Iron Age South Asia. It was the home of Gandhari, the princess and her brother Shakuni the king of Gandhara Kingdom.

=== Pukkusāti and Achaemenid Gandhāra ===


During the 6th century BCE, Gandhara was governed under the reign of King Pukkusāti. According to Buddhist accounts, he had forged diplomatic ties with Magadha and achieved victories over neighbouring kingdoms such as that of the realm of Avanti. Pukkusāti&#x27;s kingdom was described as being 100 Yojanas in width, approximately 500 to 800 miles wide, with his capital at Taxila in modern day Punjab as stated in early Jatakas

It is noted by R. C. Majumdar that Pukkusāti would have been contemporary to the Achamenid king Cyrus the Great and according to the scholar Buddha Prakash, Pukkusāti might have acted as a bulwark against the expansion of the Persian Achaemenid Empire into Gandhara. This hypothesis posits that the army which Nearchus claimed Cyrus had lost in Gedrosia had been defeated by Pukkusāti&#x27;s Gāndhārī kingdom. Therefore, following Prakash&#x27;s position, the Achaemenids would have been able to conquer Gandhāra only after a period of decline after the reign of Pukkusāti, combined with the growth of Achaemenid power under the kings Cambyses II and Darius I. However, the presence of Gandhāra among the list of Achaemenid provinces in Darius&#x27;s Behistun Inscription confirms that his empire had inherited this region from Cyrus. It is unknown whether Pukkusāti remained in power after the Achaemenid conquest as a Persian vassal or if he was replaced by a Persian satrap, although Buddhist sources claim that he renounced his throne and became a monk after becoming a disciple of the Buddha. The annexation under Cyrus was limited to the Western sphere of Gandhāra as only during the reign of Darius the Great did the region between the Indus River and the Jhelum River become annexed.

However Megasthenes Indica, states that the Achaemenids never conquered India and had only approached its borders after battling with the Massagetae, it further states that the Persians summoned mercenaries specifically from the Oxydrakai tribe, who were previously known to have resisted the incursions of Alexander the Great, but they never entered their armies into the region of Gandhara. 
During the reign of Xerxes I, Gandharan troops were noted by Herodotus to have taken part in the Second Persian invasion of Greece and were described as clothed similar to that of the Bactrians. Herodotus states that during the battle they were led by the Achamenid general Artyphius.

Under Persian rule, a system of centralized administration, with a bureaucratic system, was introduced into the Indus Valley for the first time. Provinces or &quot;satrapy&quot; were established with provincial capitals. The Gandhara satrapy, established 518 BCE with its capital at Pushkalavati (Charsadda). It was also during the Achaemenid Empire rule of Gandhara that the Kharosthi script, the script of Gandhari prakrit, was born through the Aramaic alphabet.

=== Hellenistic era Gandhāra ===

According to Arrian&#x27;s Indica, the area corresponding to Gandhara situated between the Kabul River and the Indus River was inhabited by two tribes noted as the Assakenoi and Astakanoi whom he describes as &#x27;Indian&#x27; and occupying the two great cities of Massaga located around the Swat valley and Pushkalavati in modern day Peshawar.

The sovereign of Taxila, Omphis, formed an alliance with Alexander, motivated by a longstanding animosity towards Porus, who governed the region encompassed by the Chenab and Jhelum River. Omphis, in a gesture of goodwill, presented Alexander the great with significant gifts, esteemed among the Indian populace, and subsequently accompanied him on the expedition crossing the Indus.

In 327 BCE, Alexander the Great&#x27;s military campaign progressed to Arigaum, situated in present-day Nawagai, marking the initial encounter with the Aspasians. Arrian documented their implementation of a scorched earth strategy, evidenced by the city ablaze upon Alexander&#x27;s arrival, with its inhabitants already fleeing. The Aspasians fiercely contested Alexander&#x27;s forces, resulting in their eventual defeat. Subsequently, Alexander traversed the River Guraeus in the contemporary Dir District, engaging with the Asvakas, as chronicled in Sanskrit literature. The primary stronghold among the Asvakas, Massaga, characterized as strongly fortified by Quintus Curtius Rufus, became a focal point. Despite an initial standoff which led to Alexander being struck in the leg by an Asvaka arrow, peace terms were negotiated between the Queen of Massaga and Alexander. However, when the defenders had vacated the fort, a fierce battle ensued when Alexander broke the treaty. According to Diodorus Siculus, the Asvakas, including women fighting alongside their husbands, valiantly resisted Alexander&#x27;s army but were ultimately defeated.

=== Mauryan Gandhāra ===
During the Mauryan era, Gandhara held a pivotal position as a core territory within the empire, with Taxila serving as the provincial capital of the North West. Chanakya, a prominent figure in the establishment of the Mauryan Empire, played a key role by adopting Chandragupta Maurya, the initial Mauryan emperor. Under Chanakya&#x27;s tutelage, Chandragupta received a comprehensive education at Taxila, encompassing various arts of the time, including military training, for a duration spanning 7–8 years.

Plutarch&#x27;s accounts suggest that Alexander the Great encountered a young Chandragupta Maurya in the Punjab region, possibly during his time at the university. Subsequent to Alexander&#x27;s death, Chanakya and Chandragupta allied with Trigarta king Parvataka to conquer the Nanda Empire. This alliance resulted in the formation of a composite army, comprising Gandharans and Kambojas, as documented in the Mudrarakshasa.

Bindusaras reign witnessed a rebellion among the locals of Taxila to which according to the Ashokavadana, he dispatched Ashoka to quell the uprising. Upon entering the city, the populace conveyed that their rebellion was not against Ashoka or Bindusara but rather against oppressive ministers. In Ashoka&#x27;s subsequent tenure as emperor, he appointed his son as the new governor of Taxila. During this time, Ashoka erected numerous rock edicts in the region in the Kharosthi script and commissioned the construction of a monumental stupa in Pushkalavati, Western Gandhara, the location of which remains undiscovered to date.

According to the Taranatha, following the death of Ashoka, the northwestern region seceded from the Maurya Empire, and Virasena emerged as its king. Noteworthy for his diplomatic endeavors, Virasena&#x27;s successor, Subhagasena, maintained relations with the Seleucid Greeks. This engagement is corroborated by Polybius, who records an instance where Antiochus III the Great descended into India to renew his ties with King Subhagasena in 206 BCE, subsequently receiving a substantial gift of 150 elephants from the monarch.

===Indo-Greek Kingdom===
The Indo-Greek king Menander I (reigned 155–130 BCE) drove the Greco-Bactrians out of Gandhara and beyond the Hindu Kush, becoming king shortly after his victory.

His empire survived him in a fragmented manner until the last independent Greek king, Strato II, disappeared around 10 CE. Around 125 BCE, the Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles, son of Eucratides, fled from the Yuezhi invasion of Bactria and relocated to Gandhara, pushing the Indo-Greeks east of the Jhelum River. The last known Indo-Greek ruler was Theodamas, from the Bajaur area of Gandhara, mentioned on a 1st-century CE signet ring, bearing the Kharoṣṭhī inscription &quot;Su Theodamasa&quot; (&quot;Su&quot; was the Greek transliteration of the Kushan royal title &quot;Shau&quot; (&quot;Shah&quot; or &quot;King&quot;)).

It is during this period that the fusion of Hellenistic and South Asian mythological, artistic and religious elements becomes most apparent, especially in the region of Gandhara.

Local Greek rulers still exercised a feeble and precarious power along the borderland, but the last vestige of the Greco-Indian rulers was finished by a people known to the old Chinese as the Yueh-Chi.

=== Apracharajas ===
The Apracharajas were a historical dynasty situated in the region of Gandhara, extending from the governance of Menander II within the Indo-Greek Kingdom to the era of the early Kushans. Renowned for their significant support of Buddhism, this assertion is supported by swathes of discovered donations within their principal domain, between Taxila and Bajaur. Archaeological evidence also establishes dynastic affiliations between them and the rulers of Oddiyana in modern-day Swat.

The dynasty is argued to have been founded by Vijayakamitra, identified as a vassal to Menander II, according to the Shinkot casket. This epigraphic source further articulates that King Vijayamitra, a descendant of Vijayakamitra, approximately half a century subsequent to the initial inscription, is credited with its restoration following inflicted damage. He is presumed to have gained the throne in c. 2 BCE after succeeding Visnuvarma, with a reign of three decades lasting til c. 32 CE before being succeeded by his son Indravasu and then further by Indravasu&#x27;s grandson Indravarma II in c. 50 CE.

==== Indo-Scythian Kingdom ====

The Indo-Scythians were descended from the Sakas (Scythians) who migrated from Central Asia into South Asia from the middle of the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. They displaced the Indo-Greeks and ruled a kingdom that stretched from Gandhara to Mathura. The first Indo-Scythian king Maues established Saka hegemony by conquering Indo-Greek territories.

Some Aprachas are documented on the Silver Reliquary discovered at Sirkap, near Taxila, designating the title &quot;Stratega,&quot; denoting a position equivalent to Senapati, such as that of Indravarma who was a general during the reign of the Apracharaja Vijayamitra. Indravarma is additionally noteworthy for receiving the above-mentioned Silver Reliquary from the Indo-Scythian monarch Kharahostes, which he subsequently re-dedicated as a Buddhist reliquary, indicating was a gift in exchange for tribute or assistance. According to another reliquary inscription Indravarma is noted as the Lord of Gandhara and general during the reign of Vijayamitra. According to Apracha chronology, Indravarma was the son of Visnuvarma, an Aprachraja preceding Vijayamitra.

Indravarmas son Aspavarma is situated between 20 and 50 CE, during which numismatic evidence overlaps him with the Indo-Scythian ruler Azes II and Gondophares of the Indo-Parthians whilst also describing him as &#x27;Stratega&#x27; or general of the Aprachas. In accordance with a Buddhist Avadana, Aspavarma and a Saka noble, Jhadamitra, engaged in discussions concerning the establishment of accommodation for monks during the rainy seasons, displaying that he was a patron of Buddhism. A reliquary inscription dedicated to 50 CE, by a woman named Ariasrava, describes that her donation was made during the reign of Gondophares nephew, Abdagases I, and Aspavarma, describing the joint rule by the Aprachas and the Indo-parthians.

==== Indo-Parthian Kingdom ====

The Indo-Parthian Kingdom was ruled by the Gondopharid dynasty, named after its first ruler Gondophares. For most of their history, the leading Gondopharid kings held Taxila (in the present Punjab province of Pakistan) as their residence, but during their last few years of existence, the capital shifted between Kabul and Peshawar. These kings have traditionally been referred to as Indo-Parthians, as their coinage was often inspired by the Arsacid dynasty, but they probably belonged to wider groups of Iranic tribes who lived east of Parthia proper, and there is no evidence that all the kings who assumed the title &quot;Gondophares&quot;, which means &quot;Holder of Glory&quot;, were even related.

During the dominion of the Indo-Parthians, Apracharaja Sasan, as described on numismatic evidence identifying him as the nephew of Aspavarma, emerged as a figure of significance. Aspavarman, a preceding Apracharaja contemporaneous with Gondophares, was succeeded by Sasan, after having ascended from a subordinate governance role to a recognized position as one of Gondophares&#x27;s successors. He assumed the position following Abdagases I. The Kushan ruler Vima Takto is known through numismatic evidence to have overstruck the coins of Sasan, whilst a numismatic hoard had found coins of Sasan together with smaller coins of Kujula Kadphises It has also been discovered that Sasan overstruck the coins of Nahapana of the Western Satraps, this line of coinage dating between 40 and 78 CE.

It was noted by Philostratus and Apollonius of Tyana upon their visit with Phraotes in 46 AD, that during this time the Gandharans living between the Kabul River and Taxila had coinage of Orichalcum and Black brass, and their houses appearing as single-story structures from the outside, but upon entering, underground rooms were also present. They describe Taxila as being the same size as Nineveh, being walled like a Greek city whilst also being shaped with Narrow roads, and further describe Phraotes kingdom as containing the old territory of Porus. Following an exchange with the king, Phraotes is reported to have subsidized both barbarians and neighbouring states, to avert incursions into his kingdom. Phraotes also recounts that his father, being the son of a king, had become an orphan from a young age. In accordance with Indian customs, two of his relatives assumed responsibility for his upbringing until they were killed by rebellious nobles during a ritualistic ceremony along the Indus River. This event led to the usurpation of the throne, compelling Phraotes&#x27; father to seek refuge with the king situated beyond the Hydaspes River, in modern-day Punjab, a ruler esteemed greater than Phraotes&#x27; father. Moreover, Phraotes states that his father received an education facilitated by the Brahmins upon request to the king and married the daughter of the Hydaspian king, whilst having one son who was Phraotes himself. Phraotes proceeds to narrate the opportune moment he seized to reclaim his ancestral kingdom, sparked by a rebellion of the citizens of Taxila against the usurpers. With fervent support from the populace, Phraotes led a triumphant entry into the residence of the usurpers, whilst the citizens brandished torches, swords, and bows in a display of unified resistance.

==== Tribes mentioned by Pliny ====
During this period in the 1st century CE, Pliny the Elder notes a list of tribes in the Vahika and Gandhara regions spanning from the lower Indus to the mountain tribes near the Hindu Kush.

=== Kushan Gandhāra ===
The Kushans conquered Bactria after having been defeated by the Xiongnu and forced to retreat from the Central Asian steppes. The Yuezhi fragmented the region of Bactria into five distinct territories, with each tribe of the Yuezhi assuming dominion over a separate kingdom. However, a century after this division, Kujula Kadphises of the Kushan tribe emerged victorious by destroying the other four Yuezhi tribes and consolidating his reign as king. Kujula then invaded Parthia and annexed the upper reaches of the Kabul River before further conquering Jibin. In 78 CE the Indo-Parthians seceded Gandhara to the Kushans with Kujula Kadphises son Vima Takto succeeding the Apracharaja Sases in Taxila and further conquering Tianzhu (India) before installing a general as a satrap.

According to the Xiyu Zhuan, the inhabitants residing in the upper reaches of the Kabul River were extremely wealthy and excelled in commerce, with their cultural practices bearing resemblance to those observed in Tianzhu (India). However, the text also characterizes them as weak and easily conquered with their political allegiance never being constant. Over time, the region underwent successive annexations by Tianzhu, Jibin, and Parthia during periods of their respective strength, only to be lost when these powers experienced a decline. The Xiyu Zhuan describes Tianzhu&#x27;s customs as bearing similarities to that of the Yuezhi and the inhabitants riding on elephants in warfare.

The Kushan period is considered the Golden Period of Gandhara. Peshawar Valley and Taxila are littered with ruins of &quot;stupas&quot; and monasteries of this period. Gandharan art flourished and produced some of the best pieces of sculpture from the Indian subcontinent. Gandhara&#x27;s culture peaked during the reign of the great Kushan king Kanishka the Great (127 CE – 150 CE). The cities of Taxila (Takṣaśilā) at Sirsukh and Purushapura (modern-day Peshawar) reached new heights. Purushapura along with Mathura became the capital of the great empire stretching from Central Asia to Northern India with Gandhara being in the midst of it. Emperor Kanishka was a great patron of the Buddhist faith; Buddhism spread from India to Central Asia and the Far East across Bactria and Sogdia, where his empire met the Han Empire of China. Buddhist art spread from Gandhara to other parts of Asia. In Gandhara, Mahayana Buddhism flourished and Buddha was represented in human form. Under the Kushans new Buddhist &quot;stupas&quot; were built and old ones were enlarged. Huge statues of the Buddha were erected in monasteries and carved into the hillsides. Kanishka also built the 400-foot Kanishka stupa at Peshawar. This tower was reported by Chinese monks Faxian, Song Yun, and Xuanzang who visited the country. The stupa was built during the Kushan era to house Buddhist relics and was among the tallest buildings in the ancient world.

===Kidarites===
The Kidarites conquered Peshawar and parts of the northwest Indian subcontinent including Gandhara probably sometime between 390 and 410 from Kushan empire, around the end of the rule of Gupta Emperor Chandragupta II or beginning of the rule of Kumaragupta I. It is probably the rise of the Hephthalites and the defeats against the Sasanians which pushed the Kidarites into northern India. Their last ruler in Gandhara was Kandik, .

===Alchon Huns===
Around 430 King Khingila, the most notable Alchon ruler, emerged and took control of the routes across the Hindu Kush from the Kidarites. Coins of the Alchons rulers Khingila and Mehama were found at the Buddhist monastery of Mes Aynak, southeast of Kabul, confirming the Alchon presence in this area around 450–500 CE. The numismatic evidence as well as the so-called &quot;Hephthalite bowl&quot; from Gandhara, now in the British Museum, suggests a period of peaceful coexistence between the Kidarites and the Alchons, as it features two Kidarite noble hunters, together with two Alchon hunters and one of the Alchons inside a medallion. At one point, the Kidarites withdrew from Gandhara, and the Alchons took over their mints from the time of Khingila. 

The Alchons undertook the mass destruction of Buddhist monasteries and stupas at Taxila, a high centre of learning, which never recovered from the destruction. Virtually all of the Alchon coins found in the area of Taxila were found in the ruins of burned down monasteries, where some of the invaders died alongside local defenders during the wave of destructions. It is thought that the Kanishka stupa, one of the most famous and tallest buildings in antiquity, was destroyed by them during their invasion of the area in the 460s CE. The Mankiala stupa was also vandalized during their invasions.

Mihirakula in particular is remembered by Buddhist sources to have been a &quot;terrible persecutor of their religion&quot; in Gandhara. During the reign of Mihirakula, over one thousand Buddhist monasteries throughout Gandhara are said to have been destroyed. In particular, the writings of Chinese monk Xuanzang from 630 CE explained that Mihirakula ordered the destruction of Buddhism and the expulsion of monks. The Buddhist art of Gandhara, in particular Greco-Buddhist art, became extinct around this period. When Xuanzang visited Gandhara in , he reported that Buddhism had drastically declined in favour of Shaivism and that most of the monasteries were deserted and left in ruins. It is also noted by Kalhana that Brahmins of Gandhara accepted from Mihirakula gifts of Agraharams. Kalhana also noted in his Rajatarangini how Mihirakula oppressed local Brahmins of South Asia and imported Gandharan Brahmins into Kashmir and India and states that he had given thousands of villages to these Brahmins in Kashmir.

===Turk and Hindu Shahis===

The Turk Shahis ruled Gandhara until 843 CE when they were overthrown by the Hindu Shahis. The Hindu Shahis are believed to belong to the Uḍi/Oḍi tribe, namely the people of Oddiyana in Gandhara.

The history of the Hindu Shahis begins in 843 CE with Kallar deposing the last Turk Shahi ruler, Lagaturman. Samanta succeeded him, and it was during his reign that the region of Kabul was lost to the Persianate Saffarid empire. Lalliya replaced Samanta soon after and re-conquered Kabul whilst also subduing the region of Zabulistan. He is additionally noteworthy for coming into conflict with Samkaravarman of the Utpala dynasty, resulting in his victory and the latter&#x27;s death in Hazara and was the first Shahi noted by Kalhana. He is depicted as a great ruler with strength to the standard where kings of other regions would seek shelter in his capital of Udabhanda, a change from the previous capital of Kabul. Bhimadeva, the next most notable ruler, is most significant for vanquishing the Samanid Empire in Ghazni and Kabul in response to their conquests, his grand-daughter Didda was also the last ruler of the Lohara dynasty. Jayapala then gained control and was brought into conflict with the newly formed Ghaznavid Empire, however, he was eventually defeated. During his rule and that of his son and successor, Anandapala, the kingdom of Lahore was conquered. The following Shahi rulers all resisted the Ghaznavids but were ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in the downfall of the empire in 1026 CE.

===Rediscovery===
By the time Gandhara had been absorbed into the empire of Mahmud of Ghazni, Buddhist buildings were already in ruins and Gandhara&#x27;s art had been forgotten. After Al-Biruni, the Kashmiri writer Kalhaṇa wrote his book &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; in 1151. He recorded some events that took place in Gandhara and provided details about its last royal dynasty and capital Udabhandapura.

In the 19th century, British soldiers and administrators started taking an interest in the ancient history of the Indian Subcontinent. In the 1830s coins of the post-Ashoka period were discovered, and in the same period, Chinese travelogues were translated. Charles Masson, James Prinsep, and Alexander Cunningham deciphered the Kharosthi script in 1838. Chinese records provided locations and site plans for Buddhist shrines. Along with the discovery of coins, these records provided clues necessary to piece together the history of Gandhara. In 1848 Cunningham found Gandhara sculptures north of Peshawar. He also identified the site of Taxila in the 1860s. From then on a large number of Buddhist statues were discovered in the Peshawar valley.

Archaeologist John Marshall excavated at Taxila between 1912 and 1934. He discovered separate Greek, Parthian, and Kushan cities and a large number of &quot;stupas&quot; and monasteries. These discoveries helped to piece together much more of the chronology of the history of Gandhara and its art.

After 1947 Ahmed Hassan Dani and the Archaeology Department at the University of Peshawar made several discoveries in the Peshawar and Swat Valley. Excavation of many of the sites of the Gandhara Civilization is being done by researchers from Peshawar and several universities around the world.

==Culture==
===Language===
Gandhara&#x27;s language was a Prakrit or &quot;Middle Indo-Aryan&quot; dialect, usually called Gāndhārī. Under the Kushan Empire, Gāndhārī spread into adjoining regions of South and Central Asia. It used the Kharosthi script, which is derived from the Aramaic script, and it died out about in the 4th century CE.

Hindko, historically spoken in Purushapura, the ancient capital of the Gandhara Civilization, has deep roots in the region&#x27;s rich cultural and intellectual heritage. Derived from Shauraseni Prakrit, a Middle Indo-Aryan language of northern India, Hindko evolved from one of the key vernaculars of Sanskrit. The Gandhara region&#x27;s dynamic cultural and political shifts influenced Hindko&#x27;s linguistic development. Today, Hindko which is known as Pishori, Kohati, Chacchi, Ghebi, Hazara Hindko, primarily spoken in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, Pothohar Plateau, Hazara Division, especially where Gandhara Civilization took birth from, preserving its historical significance and reflecting the region&#x27;s enduring linguistic legacy. Hindko, identifying shared phonological, morphological, and syntactical features that trace back to Prakrit languages. Inscriptions and manuscripts from the Gandhara region show linguistic patterns that link ancient Prakrit or Middle Indo Aryan to modern Hindko.

Linguistic evidence links some groups of the Dardic languages with Gandhari. The Kohistani languages, now all being displaced from their original homelands, were once more widespread in the region and most likely descend from the ancient dialects of the region of Gandhara. The last to disappear was Tirahi, still spoken some years ago in a few villages in the vicinity of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan, by descendants of migrants expelled from Tirah by the Afridi Pashtuns in the 19th century. Georg Morgenstierne claimed that Tirahi is &quot;probably the remnant of a dialect group extending from Tirah through the Peshawar district into Swat and Dir&quot;. Nowadays, it must be entirely extinct and the region is now dominated by Iranian languages brought in by later immigrations, such as Pashto. Among the modern day Indo-Aryan languages still spoken today, Torwali shows the closest linguistic affinity possible to &quot;Niya&quot;, a dialect of Gāndhārī.

===Religion===


====Mahāyāna Buddhism====
As per Pali sources, Buddhism first reached Gandhara following the Third Buddhist council which was held in Pataliputra during the reign of Ashoka in the third-century BCE. Various monks were dispatched to different parts of the empire and the missionary dispatched to Gandhara specifically was Majjhantika who originated from the city of Varanasi in India.

Mahāyāna Pure Land sutras were brought from the Gandhāra region to China as early as 147 CE, when the Kushan monk Lokakṣema began translating some of the first Buddhist sutras into Chinese. The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from the Gāndhārī language. Lokakṣema translated important Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;, as well as rare, early Mahāyāna sūtras on topics such as samādhi, and meditation on the Buddha Akṣobhya. Lokaksema&#x27;s translations continue to provide insight into the early period of Mahāyāna Buddhism. This corpus of texts often includes and emphasizes ascetic practices forest dwelling, and absorption in states of meditative concentration:

Some scholars believe that the Mahāyāna &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; was compiled in the age of the Kushan Empire in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, by order of Mahīśāsaka bhikṣus which flourished in the Gandhāra region. However, it is likely that the longer &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; owes greatly to the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda sect as well for its compilation, and in this sutra, there are many elements in common with the Lokottaravādin &quot;Mahāvastu&quot;. There are also images of Amitābha Buddha with the bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta which were made in Gandhāra during the Kushan era.

The &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot; records that Kaniṣka of the Kushan Empire presided over the establishment of the Mahāyāna Prajñāpāramitā teachings in the northwest. Tāranātha wrote that in this region, 500 bodhisattvas attended the council at Jālandhra monastery during the time of Kaniṣka, suggesting some institutional strength for Mahāyāna in the north-west during this period. Edward Conze goes further to say that Prajñāpāramitā had great success in the north-west during the Kushan period, and may have been the &quot;fortress and hearth&quot; of early Mahāyāna, but not its origin, which he associates with the Mahāsāṃghika branch of Buddhism.

===Art===

Gandhāra is noted for the distinctive Gandhāra style of Buddhist art, which shows the influence of Hellenistic and local Indian influences from the Gangetic Valley. The Gandhāran art flourished and achieved its peak during the Kushan period, from the 1st to the 5th centuries, but it declined and was destroyed after the invasion of the Alchon Huns in the 5th century.

Siddhārtha shown as a bejeweled prince (before Siddhārtha renounces palace life) is a common motif. Stucco, as well as stone, were widely used by sculptors in Gandhara for the decoration of monastic and cult buildings. Buddhist imagery combined with some artistic elements from the cultures of the Hellenistic world. An example is the youthful Buddha, his hair in wavy curls, similar to statutes of Apollo. Sacred artworks and architectural decorations used limestone for stucco composed by a mixture of local crushed rocks (i.e. schist and granite) which resulted compatible with the outcrops located in the mountains northwest of Islamabad.

The artistic traditions of Gandhara art can be divided into the following phases:
*Indo-Greek art; 2nd century BCE to 1st century CE
*Indo-Scythian art; 1st century BCE to 1st century CE
*Kushan art; 1st century CE to 4th century CE

<text>The Grammy Award for Best New Age, Ambient or Chant Album is presented to recording artists for quality albums in the new-age music genre at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best New Age Recording, the honor was first presented to Swiss musician Andreas Vollenweider at the 29th Grammy Awards in 1987 for his album &quot;Down to the Moon&quot;. Two compilation albums featuring Windham Hill Records artists were nominated that same year. The record label was founded by William Ackerman, later an award nominee and 2005 winner for the album &quot;Returning&quot;. From 1988 to 1991 the category was known as Best New Age Performance. from 1992 to 2023, the award was presented as Best New Age Album. Beginning in 2001, award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists. From 2023, the category has been known as Best New Age, Ambient or Chant Album.

While &quot;new-age&quot; music can be difficult to define, journalist Steven Rea described the genre as &quot;music that is acoustic, electronic, jazzy, folky and incorporates classical and pop elements, Eastern and Latin influences, exotic instrumentation and environmental sound effects.&quot; According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented for instrumental or vocal new-age albums &quot;containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded material&quot;, with seasonal recordings not being eligible. The addition of the award category reflected a &quot;coming of age&quot; of the music genre, though some musicians classified as new age dislike the term &quot;new age&quot; and some of its negative connotations.

==Multiple wins==
As of 2015, Paul Winter holds the record for the most wins in this category, having won six times (four times as the leader of the group Paul Winter Consort). Winter is the only musician to win the award consecutively; he received an award in 1994 for &quot;Spanish Angel&quot; as a member of his ensemble and another in 1995 for &quot;Prayer for the Wild Things&quot; as a solo artist. Irish musician Enya has received four awards. Kitarō holds the record for the most nominations, with sixteen (with only one win, in 2001). All five volumes of Kitarō&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Journey of Ku-Kai&quot; series were nominated for Best New Age Album.

Pianist Peter Kater held the record for most nominations without a win, with 12, until he finally won his first Grammy (for &quot;Dancing on Water&quot;) in 2018. He also holds the record from the most consecutive nominations, with 11, having been nominated every year between 2007 and 2018.

Native American flutist R. Carlos Nakai is the only artist to be nominated for more than one work within the same year—for the 42nd Grammy Awards he was nominated alongside Paul Horn for &quot;Inside Monument Valley&quot; and for his own album &quot;Inner Voices&quot;.

<text>Siltstone, also known as aleurolite, is a clastic sedimentary rock that is composed mostly of silt. It is a form of mudrock with a low clay mineral content, which can be distinguished from shale by its lack of fissility.

Although its permeability and porosity is relatively low, siltstone is sometimes a tight gas reservoir rock, an unconventional reservoir for natural gas that requires hydraulic fracturing for economic gas production.

Siltstone was prized in ancient Egypt for manufacturing statuary and cosmetic palettes. The siltstone quarried at Wadi Hammamat was a hard, fine-grained siltstone that resisted flaking and was almost ideal for such uses.

== Description ==
There is not complete agreement on the definition of siltstone. One definition is that siltstone is mudrock (clastic sedimentary rock containing at least 50% clay and silt) in which at least 2/3 of the clay and silt fraction is composed of silt-sized particles. Silt is defined as grains 2–62 μm in diameter, or 4 to 8 on the Krumbein phi (φ) scale. An alternate definition is that siltstone is any sedimentary rock containing 50% or more of silt-sized particles. Siltstones can be distinguished from claystone in the field by chewing a small sample; claystone feels smooth while siltstone feels gritty.

Siltstones differ significantly from sandstones due to their smaller pores and a higher propensity for containing a significant clay fraction. Although often mistaken for a shale, siltstone lacks the laminations and fissility along horizontal lines which are typical of shale. Siltstones may contain concretions. Unless the siltstone is fairly shaly, stratification is likely to be obscure and it tends to weather at oblique angles unrelated to bedding.

== Origin ==
Siltstone is an unusual rock, in which most of the silt grains are made of quartz. The origin of quartz silt has been a topic of much research and debate. Some quartz silt likely has its origin in fine-grained foliated metamorphic rock, while much marine silt is likely biogenic, but most quartz sediments come from granitic rocks in which quartz grains are much larger than quartz silt. Highly energetic processes are required to break these grains down to silt size. Among proposed mechanism are glacial grinding; weathering in cold, tectonically active mountain ranges; normal weathering, particularly in tropical regions; and formation in hot desert environments by salt weathering.

Siltstones form in relatively quiet depositional environments where fine particles can settle out of the transporting medium (air or water) and accumulate on the surface. They are found in turbidite sequences, in deltas, in glacial deposits, and in miogeosynclinal settings.

<text>Sacred Heart University (SHU) is a private, Roman Catholic university in Fairfield, Connecticut, United States. It was founded in 1963 by Walter W. Curtis, Bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Sacred Heart was the first Catholic university in the United States to be staffed by the laity.

Sacred Heart is the second-largest Catholic university in New England, behind Boston College. It offers more than 80 degree programs to over 8,500 students at the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral levels.

==History==
Sacred Heart University was founded in 1963 by Walter W. Curtis, Bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport on the grounds of the former Notre Dame Catholic High School. The university is led and staffed by the laity independent and locally oriented. The founding president was William H. Conley (1907–1974). Former American ambassador and Diplomat Thomas Patrick Melady served as president of the university from 1976 to 1986.

Enrollment has risen from the original class of 173 to over 10,500 full and part-time undergraduate and graduate students, and the faculty has increased from 9 to 281 full-time professors and over 520 adjunct professors since 1963.

In 1990, Sacred Heart built the first dorms, and began accepting residential. It now has 10 residential buildings with 50 percent of the full-time undergraduates residing in university housing.

The university has 32 varsity teams that compete in Division I. In 1997, The William H. Pitt Health and Recreation Center was opened.

In 1981, then-United States vice president George H. W. Bush received an honorary degree from Sacred Heart.

In 2006, Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, made a financial gift to the university and a College of Business was named after him.

In recent years, Sacred Heart University has purchased land in the surrounding Fairfield, Connecticut area, and has built new academic buildings, dormitories, and in January 2023 completed construction of the hockey rink.

=== Recent history ===
On September 27, 2009, Sacred Heart University opened the Chapel of the Holy Spirit.

In 2010, Sacred Heart announced plans to open a new Health and Wellness Center. The center was built on Park Avenue across from the main campus.

In 2012, the university opened a new student commons building, named the Linda E. McMahon Student Commons, after McMahon donated $5 million to the university. The new Commons includes dining facilities, lounge space, and a bookstore.

In 2014, Sacred Heart broke ground for a new learning center, called the Student Success Center. The center provides educational support for students at the university and from the surrounding region. In 2015, the university started construction of the Center for Healthcare Education.

In 2015, the university opened the Frank and Marisa Martire Center for Business &amp; Communications building, which houses the Jack Welch College of Business and the School of Communication &amp; Media Arts. The building was designed Sasaki Associates, who also designed the Linda E. McMahon Student Commons.

In 2016, Sacred Heart opened a new residence hall, called Bergoglio Hall, named after Pope Francis, whose birth name is Jorge Bergoglio.

In October 2016, Nikki Yovino reported to the police that she was raped by two black Sacred Heart University football players at an off-campus party. Yovino has admitted, months later, that the sexual assault was a lie in an attempt to gain the attention of another man. However, in 2018, she pled guilty to two counts of second-degree falsely reporting an incident and one count of interfering with police and was sentenced to one year in jail and three years of probation. The men Yovino accused, Malik St. Hilaire and Dhameer Bradley, were forced out of Sacred Heart University after losing their scholarships amid the false accusations. As of August 27, 2018, both men are no longer enrolled at Sacred Heart University and with no remediation for losing their scholarships.

In November 2016, Sacred Heart acquired the former GE corporate headquarters located near its main campus.

In April 2017, Sacred Heart and St. Vincent&#x27;s College, another Catholic college in Connecticut, agreed to merge management operations. In 2018, the schools&#x27; merger was completed and St. Vincent&#x27;s became known as St. Vincent&#x27;s College at Sacred Heart University.

In 2019, Sacred Heart was ranked on Princeton Reviews list of best schools, including tenth for &quot;Happiest Students&quot;. 

Sacred Heart also announced in 2019 it would renovate and reopen the Community Theater in downtown Fairfield.

In 2020, Sacred Heart announced plans to build a $60 million hockey arena.

Sacred Heart took over management of the nearby Discovery Museum and Planetarium as of January 2021.

== Academics ==

The university consists of five colleges: College of Arts &amp; Sciences, which includes the School of Communication &amp; Media Arts and the School of Computing; Jack Welch College of Business and Technology; College of Health Professions; College of Nursing and the Isabelle Farrington College of Education. Sacred Heart University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

Sacred Heart University offers more than 80 bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral programs. Sacred Heart also offers qualified undergraduates the opportunity to complete an undergraduate degree and a graduate degree with five to six years depending on the degree program.

In 2012, the university ranked as America&#x27;s least affordable university in a Newsweek ranking.

===Greek life===
Sacred Heart is home to a total of more than ten fraternities and sororities.

==Athletics==

The Pioneers compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), Atlantic Hockey America, Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA), and the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA).

Nearly 800 students participate in the university&#x27;s 33 athletic teams (18 female teams and 15 male teams) along with more than 500 students who participate in 23 Club Sports.
The football team plays at the Football Championship Subdivision level and claims an FCS title in 2001. Their biggest rivalry is with the oldest public university in Connecticut, Central Connecticut State University, in what has been dubbed the Constitution State Rivalry.

The men&#x27;s fencing team won the Northeast Conference title five years in a row (2010–2014) and was ranked #9 in 2011.

On February 21, 2013, the Sacred Heart University athletics department hired Major League Baseball player and manager Bobby Valentine as the athletic director.

The women&#x27;s ice hockey program had competed as in independent from 2003 to 2019 at the National Collegiate level, with &quot;National Collegiate&quot; being the NCAA&#x27;s official designation for championship events in sports in which members of Divisions I and II compete for a single national title. The Pioneers participate in the NEWHA, established in 2017–18 by Sacred Heart, fellow Division I member Holy Cross, and four Division II schools. Sacred Heart won the inaugural NEWHA tournament title in 2018. The NEWHA lost Holy Cross to Hockey East after that season, but returned to 6 members for 2019–20 with the arrival of LIU, a fellow NEC member that launched a new women&#x27;s program. With the NEWHA soon to have the membership total required for an automatic bid to the NCAA women&#x27;s tournament, the NEWHA formally organized as a conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition effective with LIU&#x27;s arrival in 2019–20.

== Center for Christian–Jewish Understanding ==
Sacred Heart has played a role in interfaith dialog and education between Christians and Jews. Interfaith centers in the U.S. began in 1953 at Seton Hall University, and have spread to 27 centers around the country, including the Center for Christian–Jewish Understanding of Sacred
Heart which was established in 1992 as a research and academic division of the University under the direction of Anthony J. Cernera and Joseph Ehrenkranz.

By this time, Holocaust studies were well developed, and the CCJU branched out, creating forums for a national and international audience. This was also the year when the new &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; was issued by Pope John Paul II, the first in four centuries, integrating the latest teachings of the Church with respect to Judaism. In the late 1990s, a strategy of using symbolic gestures was developed to further CCJU&#x27;s educational goals, such as the 1996 establishment of the &quot;Nostra Aetate&quot; Awards Program, named after the 1965 &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; declaration of Vatican II which focused on the relationship that Catholics have with Jews. The award program recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to interreligous dialog and understanding. The first recipients of the award were Cardinal John O’Connor of the Archdiocese of New York and Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman. 

in 2000, the Pope made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, accompanied by leaders of the CCJU. The Vatican established diplomatic relations with Israel, and a new feeling of friendship and responsibility between Christians and Jews was in the air. The Center went on to organize a series of international conferences on understanding the Other, including 2006 publication of conference papers on &quot;What Do We Want the Other to Teach About Us?&quot; with responses from Jewish, Christian, and Muslim scholars. Other programs included Holocaust teacher education, lecture series, and other publications including the semiannual &quot;CCJU Perspective&quot; with national and international influence, and programs to support young religious leaders, visits to Krakow and Rome to establish a structure for interreligious dialogue that could be modeled worldwide.

During the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, the area was controlled by the Chiba clan. During the Sengoku period, the Chiba clan fought the Satomi clan to the south, and the Later Hōjō clan to the west. After the defeat of the Chiba clan, the area came within the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who assigned one of his chief generals, Doi Toshikatsu to rebuild Chiba Castle and to rule over Sakura Domain as a &quot;daimyō.&quot; Doi rebuilt the area as a &quot;jōkamachi&quot;, or castle town, which became the largest castle town in the Bōsō region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Sakura Domain came to be ruled for most of the Edo period under the Hotta clan. In the Bakumatsu period the domain became a center for &quot;rangaku&quot; studies, centered on the Juntendō school of the doctor Taizen Satō (1804 – 1872). The Juntendō and other educational institutions in Sakura contributed greatly to the Meiji Restoration. After the abolition of Sakura Domain, the area eventually became part of Chiba Prefecture.

<text>The Merritt Parkway (also known locally as &quot;The Merritt&quot;) is a controlled-access parkway in Fairfield County, Connecticut, with a small section at the northern end in New Haven County. Designed for Connecticut&#x27;s Gold Coast, the parkway is known for its scenic layout, its uniquely styled signage, and the architecturally elaborate overpasses along the route. As one of the first, oldest parkways in the United States, it is designated as a National Scenic Byway and is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Signed as part of Route 15, it runs from the New York state line in Greenwich, where it serves to continue the Hutchinson River Parkway, to exit 37 in Milford, where the Wilbur Cross Parkway begins. Facing bitter opposition, the project took six years to build in three different sections, with the Connecticut Department of Transportation constantly requiring additional funding due to the area&#x27;s high property value. The parkway was named for U.S. Congressman Schuyler Merritt. In 2010, the National Trust for Historic Preservation called the Merritt Parkway one of &quot;America&#x27;s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places&quot;.

Trucks, buses, trailers, towed vehicles, and all vehicles tall or taller are not allowed on any part of the parkway due to its low bridges, narrow lanes, and tight curve radii.

The roadway sign of the Merritt features a blue shield with white lettering, along with the foliage of &quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;, commonly known as the mountain laurel, the state flower of Connecticut.

==Route description==

The Merritt is one of a handful of United States highways listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It is acknowledged for the beauty of the forest through which it passes, as well as the architectural design of its overpasses; at the time of its construction, each bridge was decorated in a unique fashion so that no two bridges on the parkway looked alike. Newer overpasses used at exit 39 (US 7), though, did not maintain this tradition, and as a result, exit 39 on the parkway is now spanned by several ordinary modern bridges constructed using undecorated concrete-on-steel I-beams.

The parkway has two lanes in each direction. Due to its age, it was originally constructed without the merge lanes, long on-ramps, and long off-ramps that are found on modern freeways. Some entrances have perilously short and/or sharp ramps; some entrances even have stop signs, with no merge lane whatsoever; this leads to some dangerous entrances onto the highway. Most have since been modernized, with the interchange of Route 111 in Trumbull featuring Connecticut&#x27;s first single-point urban interchange (SPUI). The stretch of road between exit 42 in Westport and exit 44 in Fairfield is a very long stretch, roughly long without a single exit, referred to by local traffic reports as the &quot;No Exit Zone&quot; or &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. An exit 43 was planned in the middle of this stretch, but was never built because it would have connected to a northerly extension of the Sherwood Island Connector, which itself was never built to that point.

Vehicles tall or taller in height, weighing or more, towing a trailer, or having more than four wheels are not allowed on the parkway. Under extenuating circumstances, however, ConnDOT may issue permits for oversized vehicles to use the parkway.

==History==

The Merritt Parkway is one of the oldest scenic parkways in the United States. The portion from Greenwich to Norwalk was opened on June 29, 1938. The section from Norwalk to Trumbull was completed in November 1939, and in 1940, it was finished to the Housatonic River in Stratford. The parkway was named for U.S. Congressman Schuyler Merritt, who was instrumental in enacting legislation allowing the parkway to be built. The Merritt Parkway is the first leg of what later became modern Route 15. Built between 1934 and 1940, the Merritt Parkway runs for from the New York state line in Greenwich to the Housatonic River in Stratford. It was conceived as a way to alleviate congestion on the Boston Post Road (U.S. Route 1) in Fairfield County. After the parkway fully opened in 1940, travelers commonly stopped to picnic along the side of the road. The Merritt Parkway Advisory Commission (later the Merritt Parkway Advisory Committee) decided to ban horses and buggies, bicycles, pedestrians, billboards, and U-turns, while a system of horse trails along the parkway was developed, but later abandoned. To ease objections from county residents, who feared an influx of New Yorkers on their roads, in their towns, on their beaches, and through their forests, highway planners called on engineers, landscape architects, and architects to create a safe and aesthetically pleasing limited-access highway, one with exit and entrance ramps, but no intersections, that would not spoil the countryside. The bridges played a prominent role in the design. Architect George L. Dunkelberger designed them all. They reflected the popularity of the Art Deco style, with touches of neoclassical and modern design. Some of these bridges were constructed by the Works Progress Administration.

In 1948, the road was signed as part of Connecticut Route 15. Originally, the road had the unsigned designation of Connecticut Route 1A. Also around this time, exit numbers were posted on the road. In December 1949, a connection to the Wilber Cross Parkway was opened to traffic.

In 1955, exit 30, an at-grade intersection with Butternut hollow road that crossed traffic in both directions, was permanently closed. It had already been declared a safety hazard. 
In 1957, trees inside the median were cut down for the first time, and a median was installed on a terchous curve that often got slippery when wet. These followed serious accidents caused by tree related crashes.

The road was initially maintained by the Merritt Parkway Commission, though in 1959, this was absorbed into CDOT and renamed the Merritt Partway Committee.

In the late 1960s, the segment of roadway from Stamford to Greenwich was reconstructed in order to make the roadway straighter. 

In July 1976, the toll at the Greenwich Toll Plaza was increased from a nickel to 25 cents.

In the late 1970s, a project to replace the Huntington Turnpike exit as well as the original Route 8 exit with new ramps was undertaken. The old ramps were demolished by 1979, with the new exits opened in 1983.

Tolls were eliminated at the Greenwich Toll Plaza on June 27, 1988, as part of a mandate that abolished tolls on all of Connecticut&#x27;s roads. The toll plaza is preserved in Stratford&#x27;s Boothe Memorial Park near Exit 53, complete with still-flashing lights over each toll lane.

In 1992, a new interchange with US 7 was opened, which involved rebuilding another portion of roadway.

In 1999, a project to reconstruct exit 44 and eliminate exit 45 was completed at the cost of $4.6 million. In addition, exit 53 was reconstructed into a standard diamond interchange; it was originally a seven ramp configuration.

In April 2001, a complete reissuance of the parkway&#x27;s signs was carried out, instituting a uniform white-on-green color scheme and a sawtooth border.

In 2004, a project to rebuild exit 48 from a standard diamond interchange into a Single-point urban interchange (SPUI) was completed. Also as part of this project, a new overpass was built to replace the old one (it was not wide enough for a SPUI), though this new overpass replicated the aesthetics of the old one.

After years of environmental studies, the Connecticut Department of Transportation awarded an $87 million contract to Balfour Beatty Construction to build the replacement Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge in 2000. The southern half of the replacement bridge opened in 2003; the old bridge was demolished in 2004. In February 2004, the load unexpectedly shifted on a crane that was removing structural steel from the old bridge. The crane overturned and fell into the partially frozen Housatonic River, killing its operator. The remaining half of the bridge was completed in 2006, two years behind schedule. The new bridge has a concrete deck, with an asphalt surface, three lanes in each direction, full left and right shoulders, a sidewalk for pedestrians, wrought-iron railing, and aesthetic lighting. The bridge also includes a system of concrete fenders that protects the bridge piers from ship collisions, a feature that was absent from the original span.

Like most highways in Connecticut, exits are numbered sequentially, not mile-based, though the state is gradually transitioning to milepost-based exit numbers, and expects that the renumbering of the Merritt Parkway&#x27;s exits will be completed in 2025.

==Service plazas==
Six rest areas/service plazas, featuring parking lots, gas stations, and convenience stores, were also built along the Merritt Parkway so that drivers would not have to exit to refuel. Pairs of plazas are located opposite each other on either side of the parkway in Fairfield (near exit 46), New Canaan (near exit 37), and Greenwich (just beyond the CT-NY state line). The northbound-side plaza in Greenwich also houses a Connecticut welcome center. The plazas were originally constructed during the parkway&#x27;s days as a tolled highway, but remained even after the tolls were removed in 1988, making the parkway one of only a few toll-free highways with service plazas along its length. Between 2011 and 2015, all six of the service plazas (along with the four located further north along the Wilbur Cross Parkway) were completely renovated. The renovations preserved the original brick-and-stone façade of the buildings, but completely redesigned and modernized the interiors. The plazas now include more modern gas pumps, Alltown convenience stores, and a Dunkin&#x27; Donuts shop at each location; three of the Merritt&#x27;s six plazas also include a Subway shop. Prior to the renovations, no fast-food service had previously been available at the plazas. The renovation project was completed during the summer of 2015, when the New Canaan plazas were reopened.

In 2013, electric-vehicle (EV) charging stations for Tesla automobiles were added to both the northbound and southbound Greenwich service plazas, with four Superchargers installed in each direction. In addition, charging for CHAdeMO-equipped EVs was added to the northbound Greenwich service plaza. The parking/charging stalls are some of the first in the U.S. to be designated &quot;shared use&quot; - EVs may use the stall for up to 45 minutes to charge, or internal-combustion engine vehicles may park for up to 15 minutes.

==Safety==
One of the Merritt&#x27;s aesthetic features is also a potential danger to its drivers. Trees that line either side of the parkway, and often in the center median, grow branches that cover the roadway, and occasionally fall during severe weather, or with natural aging. Stretches of the parkway also lack guardrails on the right shoulders, creating a risk of tree-impact accidents if cars veer off the pavement.

In 2007, after complaints were voiced about the danger of the trees along the parkway, state officials announced they would trim and eliminate some of them more aggressively. A large, seemingly healthy tree fell on a car near exit 42 in Westport in June 2007, killing a couple from Pelham, New York. On June 23, 2011, a driver was killed in Stamford when a tree fell onto his car.

A state study of fatalities on Connecticut highways showed that from 1985 to 1992, about 10 people died every three years in tree-related accidents, although no other state roadway averaged more than one in three years.

The state Department of Transportation commonly sends out work crews twice a year to drive along both sides of the parkway at in search of decrepit trees. Trees that had been scheduled to be cut down in five to 10 years would be removed sooner. Some more trees also would be removed, as the shoulder of the parkway is being widened to to give drivers room to pull over.

Following the 2007 and 2011 incidents, the state became more aggressive in closing the parkway in times of severe weather. The parkway was closed during Tropical Storm Irene and the Halloween nor&#x27;easter in 2011, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. With each of those storms, many trees and limbs fell across the parkway. After Sandy, the state began a large effort to remove unhealthy trees, and in the process created much wider clearances between the roadside and forest.

In addition to numerous trees along the Parkway, interchanges were originally designed with Right-in/right-out (RIRO) ramps with no acceleration or deceleration lanes. Crashes were common at Parkway onramps, as vehicles entering the Parkway would have to stop at the top of the ramp and wait for a break in traffic, then rapidly accelerate to meet highway speeds on the heavily-traveled roadway. The Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) has made progress in improving safety at interchanges by revising ramp configurations and adding acceleration/deceleration lanes, although a few of the original RIRO interchanges remain.

The Merritt Parkway Advisory Committee meets quarterly.

==Exit list==
Exit numbers on the Merritt Parkway continue from the original sequential exits of the Hutchinson River Parkway, which ended at 27; since 2021, the Hutchinson River Parkway has used a mileage-based system ending at 19A. King Street (NY 120A), which travels along the state border, is served by exit 27 on the Merritt Parkway and exit 19A on the Hutchinson River Parkway. Prior to 2021, because additional interchanges had been added on the New York side, exit 19A on the Hutchinson River Parkway was numbered as exit 30.

<text>Johannes Hermann Zukertort (; 7 September 1842 – 20 June 1888) was a Polish-born British-German chess master. He was one of the leading world players for most of the 1870s and 1880s, but lost to Wilhelm Steinitz in the World Chess Championship 1886, which is generally regarded as the first World Chess Championship match. He was also defeated by Steinitz in 1872 in an unofficial championship.

Zukertort filled his relatively short life with a wide range of other achievements as a soldier, musician, linguist, journalist and political activist.

==Early life and non-chess achievements==
Zukertort was born on 7 September 1842 in Lublin, Congress Poland, Russian Empire as Jan Hermann Cukiertort. He said that his mother was the Baroness Krzyżanowska (Krzyzanovska). His parents were Polish Jews who converted to Protestant Christianity and missionized for the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews. Because the Christian Protestant mission among the Jewish population in Russian-occupied Poland was considered illegal and heretical, the Zukertort family emigrated to Prussia. He was educated at the gymnasium of Breslau, and in 1866 at the University of Breslau, from which he graduated in medicine in 1866. As a member of the medical corps of the Prussian army he saw service in 1866 during the Austro-Prussian war, and again during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870–1871.

Zukertort is widely suspected to have embellished his biography. In an account of his life for the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; in 1872 many claims were made on his behalf: Aristocratic descent, fluency in nine languages (fourteen, according to other sources), and proficiency in swordsmanship, dominoes, and whist; it was also stated that he had played 6,000 games of chess with Adolf Anderssen, fought in numerous battles, and was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle, the Iron Cross of the German Army, and seven other medals. He also found time to get an M.D. at Breslau in 1865, and work on the staff of the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; – Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s private organ – in addition to writing two chess books and working as the editor of a chess magazine for several years. &quot;The Oxford Companion to Chess&quot; comments, &quot;There is some truth in the last sentence: He was co-author of the books [and] co-editor of the chess magazine.&quot;

==Chess career==

===Style of play===
In an age where the majority of players played exclusively 1.e4, Zukertort was an occasional early experimenter with openings such as (The Zukertort Opening) and 

In his prime Zukertort also excelled at blindfold chess. In 1876, he played sixteen games simultaneously while blindfolded, winning eleven, drawing four, and losing only one.

===Learning chess===
Zukertort learned to play chess in Breslau when he was about age 19. Entering a tournament in that city, and receiving the odds of the queen, he lost every game, whereupon he took up the study of Bilguer&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch&quot;, with the result that in 1862 he won games from the leading German chess player Adolf Anderssen at the odds of a knight. Zukertort studied with Anderssen and within a very few years he became one of the strongest players in Germany.

Among many other notable matches that Zukertort played with Anderssen, he defeated him in 1866, lost in 1868 by a score of eight wins, three losses, one draw, and finally defeated him convincingly (5–2; no draws) in a match in 1871. In 1867 he moved to Berlin and in 1872 to London. In that year, he played Wilhelm Steinitz in London, losing 9–3 (7 losses, 1 win, 4 draws).

===Late 1870s–early 1880s===
Although Zukertort lost both his matches against Steinitz, he proved that he was superior to other opponents throughout the late 1870s and early 1880s. During this period top-class tournaments were rare and Zukertort&#x27;s best performances were mostly in matches, notably against Anderssen in 1871 and Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1881 (6 wins, 2 losses, 5 draws). Nonetheless Zukertort was one of the most successful tournament players of his time: third place behind Steinitz and Blackburne at London, 1872; first place at Cologne, and second at Leipzig in 1877; tied for first with Simon Winawer at the Paris 1878 chess tournament and beat Winawer in the playoff; second at Berlin in 1881, behind Blackburne; tied for fourth at Vienna in 1882; first at London in 1883, 3 points ahead of Steinitz. The 1878 win in Paris led to some suggestion that Zukertort was the world&#x27;s leading player, although Steinitz did not compete.

Zukertort&#x27;s win in the London 1883 chess tournament was his most significant success: He won his games against most of the world&#x27;s leading players, scoring 22/26, and he finished 3 points ahead of Steinitz, who was second with 19/26. This tournament established that Steinitz and Zukertort were clearly the best two players in the world, and led to the World Chess Championship match between these two.

The 1886 World Chess Championship match lasted from 11 January to 29 March 1886. After building up a 4–1 lead Zukertort wilted, lost four of the last five games, and lost the match by 12½–7½.

===Decline and death===
After his 1886 defeat, Zukertort&#x27;s health suffered and he was a greatly weakened player for the remaining two years of his life. Diagnoses of his ailments include rheumatism, coronary heart disease, kidney problems, and arteriosclerosis. His results after the 1886 match declined steeply: Seventh at London, and third at Nottingham in 1886; fifteenth at Frankfurt, and fourth at London in 1887; lost a match in 1887 against Blackburne (1 win, 5 losses, and 8 draws); and seventh at London in 1888.

Poor health and lack of physical stamina appeared to be one of Zukertort&#x27;s two long-term weaknesses: Some commentators attributed to illness the severity of his defeat in the 1872 match against Steinitz; aside from the tournaments mentioned above, in the 1883 London tournament he won 22 of his first 23 games – enough to give him an uncatchable lead – but lost his last 3 games.

His other weakness was that, while no one had greater attacking flair, Zukertort never approached Steinitz&#x27; understanding of positional play, and Steinitz often outmaneuvered him fairly simply.
Zukertort died on 20 June 1888, in London, from a cerebral haemorrhage after playing a game in a tournament at Simpson&#x27;s Divan, which he was leading at the time. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

<text>The statocyst is a balance sensory receptor present in some aquatic invertebrates, including bivalves, cnidarians, ctenophorans, echinoderms, cephalopods, crustaceans, and gastropods, A similar structure is also found in &quot;Xenoturbella&quot;. The statocyst consists of a sac-like structure containing a mineralised mass (statolith) and numerous innervated sensory hairs (setae). The statolith&#x27;s inertia causes it to push against the setae when the animal accelerates. Deflection of setae by the statolith in response to gravity activates neurons, providing feedback to the animal on change in orientation and allowing balance to be maintained.

In other words, the statolith shifts as the animal moves. Any movement large enough to throw the organism off balance causes the statolith to brush against tiny bristles which in turn send a message to the brain to correct its balance.

It may have been present in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians.

==Hearing==

In cephalopods like squids, statocysts provide a cochlea-like mechanism to hear. As a result, the longfin inshore squid for instance can hear low-frequency sounds between 30 and 500 Hz when the water temperature is above .

<text>Jonathan Tunick is an American orchestrator, musical director, and composer. He is best known for orchestrating the works of Stephen Sondheim, their collaboration starting in 1970 with &quot;Company&quot; and continuing until Sondheim&#x27;s death in 2021.

==Early life and education ==
Jonathan Tunick graduated from Hunter College Elementary School, and the LaGuardia Performing Arts High School, and holds degrees from Bard College and the Juilliard School. 

==Career ==
Tunick&#x27;s principal instrument is the clarinet. Much of his work has arisen from his involvement in theatre, and he is associated especially with the musicals of Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim said &quot;Tunick is a standout in his field not only because of his musicianship and imagination, but primarily because of his great sensitivity to theatrical atmosphere&quot;.

Tunick&#x27;s band, &quot;Broadway Moonlighters&quot;, played in 2008 with Barbara Cook as special guest, and played at Birdland jazz club in March 2012. He has also worked as an arranger and/or conductor on recordings with Judy Collins, Kiri Te Kanawa, Brian Asawa, Sir Neville Mariner, Itzhak Perlman, Plácido Domingo, Johnny Mathis, Barbra Streisand, Paul McCartney, and Bernadette Peters.

==Recognition and awards == 
In his review of the Bernadette Peters recording &quot;Bernadette Peters Loves Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot; (2002), John Kenrick wrote: &quot;Jonathan Tunick provides the brilliant arrangements.&quot; 

He has won all four major American show business awards: the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony, making him an EGOT. In 1978, Tunick won an Oscar for &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (Best Music, Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Best Adaptation Score). In 1982, he won an Emmy for his work on the variety television special &quot;Night of 100 Stars&quot; (Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction), and in 1988, he won a Grammy Award for his work on No One Is Alone (Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocals), and in 1997, he won the first Tony Award for Best Orchestrations for the musical &quot;Titanic&quot;. 

He has also won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Orchestrations four times and won a Drama Desk Special Award in 1982. Tunick was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in January 2009.

==Personal life==
Tunick is married to actress Leigh Beery (also known as &quot;Lee Beery&quot;), who appeared in the television soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; in 1971.

<doc id="496397" wikidata="Q2347868" url="?curid=496397" title="Culture of Iceland">
<text>The culture of Iceland is largely characterized by its literary heritage that began during the 12th century but also traditional arts such as weaving, silversmithing, and wood carving. The Reykjavík area hosts several professional theaters, art galleries, bookstores, cinemas and museums. There are four active folk dance ensembles in Iceland. Iceland&#x27;s literacy rate is among the highest in the world.

== Arts ==
=== Architecture ===
Icelandic architecture draws from Scandinavia and traditionally was influenced by the lack of native trees on the island. As a result, grass and turf-covered houses were developed. The original grass houses constructed by the original settlers of Iceland were based on Viking longhouses.

=== Literature ===
Much of the history of Iceland has been recorded in the Icelandic sagas and Edda. The most famous of these include &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, about an epic blood feud, and &quot;Grænlendinga saga&quot; and &quot;Eiríks saga&quot;, describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (now the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador). &quot;Egils saga&quot;, &quot;Laxdæla saga&quot;, &quot;Grettis saga&quot;, &quot;Gísla saga&quot;, and &quot;Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu&quot; are also notable and popular.

Iceland has produced many great authors including Halldór Laxness, Guðmundur Kamban, Tómas Guðmundsson, Davíð Stefánsson, Jón Thoroddsen, Steinn Steinarr, Guðmundur G. Hagalín, Þórbergur Þórðarson, and Jóhannes úr Kötlum. W. H. Auden and Louis MacNeice wrote &quot;Letters From Iceland&quot; (1937) to describe their travels through that country.

=== Painting and sculpture ===
The first professional secular painters appeared in Iceland in the 19th century. This group of artists included Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval, who painted village life in Iceland. Ásmundur Sveinsson, a 20th-century sculptor, was from Iceland. Einar Hákonarson is an expressionistic and figurative painter who brought the figure back into Icelandic painting in 1968. He is a pioneer in the Icelandic art scene and art education. He has been called &quot;The crusader of the painting&quot;, because of his involvement in those conflicts many Icelandic painters had with the public fine art centers. He was a driving force in founding the Icelandic Printmaking Association and its first president.

== Attitudes and customs ==
Icelanders generally have a traditional liberal Nordic outlook, similar to other Nordic countries such as Norway and Sweden. Yet, an important key to understanding Icelanders and their culture (which differentiates them from the majority of their contemporary Nordic peoples) is the high importance they place on the traits of independence and self-sufficiency. In the June 2005 European Commission Eurobarometer public opinion analysis, over 85% of Icelanders found independence to be &quot;very important&quot;, contrasted with the EU25 average of 53%, 47% for the Norwegians, and 49% for the Danish.

Icelanders are proud of their Viking heritage and Icelandic language and take great care to preserve their traditions. Modern Icelandic remains close to the Old Norse spoken in the Viking Age. Prior to the Christianization of Iceland, Pagan beliefs were strongly held, remnants of which remain today. 

Icelandic society and culture has a high degree of gender equality, with many women in leadership positions in government and business. Iceland has a highly progressive gay rights legislation, with couples having been able to register civil unions since 1996, adopt since 2006, and marry since 2010. Women retain their names after marriage, since Icelanders generally do not use surnames but patronyms or (in certain cases) matronyms.

The 2003 Children&#x27;s Act outlawed spanking, verbal and emotional abuse, and makes child protection a priority. Physical or mental violence is punishable by imprisonment and/or fine. In 2006, Iceland was ranked as the fourth happiest nation in the world. Local and national festivals include the annual National Day, celebrating the country&#x27;s independence in 1944, &quot;Sumardagurinn fyrsti&quot; which celebrates the first day of summer, and &quot;Sjómannadagurinn&quot; which is held every June to pay tribute to the country&#x27;s maritime history.

== Cuisine ==

Iceland offers wide varieties of traditional cuisine. &quot;Þorramatur&quot; (food of the &quot;þorri&quot;) is the Icelandic national food. Nowadays &quot;þorramatur&quot; is mostly eaten during the ancient Nordic month of &quot;þorri&quot;, in January and February, as a tribute to old culture. &quot;Þorramatur&quot; consists of many different types of food. These are mostly offal dishes like &quot;hrútspungar&quot; (pickled ram&#x27;s testicles), putrefied shark, singed sheep heads, singed sheep head jam, black pudding, liver sausage (similar to Scottish haggis) and dried fish (often cod or haddock).

Much of the cuisine centers on Iceland&#x27;s fishing industry. Traditional dishes include &quot;gravlax&quot; (smoked salmon marinated in salt and dill), &quot;hangikjöt&quot; (smoked lamb), and &quot;slátur&quot; (sausages made from sheep entrails). A popular food is &quot;skyr&quot; made of cultured skim milk. &quot;Brennivin&quot; is an Icelandic liquor made from potatoes and caraway.

== Education ==
The system of education in Iceland is loosely based upon the Danish system, and there are four levels: pre-school, compulsory, upper secondary and higher. Education is mandatory for children aged six to sixteen. Most institutions are funded by the state, there are very few private schools in the country. The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture has jurisdiction over education. Over the years, the educational system has been decentralised, and responsibility for primary and lower secondary schools lies with the local authorities. The state runs upper secondary schools and higher education institutions. Students can quit at age 16 or can continue until age 20.

== Entertainment ==
The popular children&#x27;s TV programme &quot;LazyTown&quot; (&quot;Latibær&quot;), created by Magnús Scheving, was produced in Iceland. Notable Icelandic musicians and bands include Björk, Kaleo (band), Sigur Rós, Laufey, and Of Monsters and Men.

=== Technology ===
Iceland is a technologically advanced and digitally-connected country. In 2006 it had the highest number of broadband Internet connections per capita among OECD countries.

== Icelandic people ==
Famous early Icelanders were Leif Erikson, who introduced Christianity to Greenland and discovered the North American mainland (&quot;c.&quot; 1000). Two famous statesmen were Bishop Jón Arason and Jón Sigurðsson, who championed for autonomy from Denmark. Vigdís Finnbogadóttir served four consecutive terms as president from 1980 to 1996, becoming the first female elected to the presidency of any republic.

Prominent writers were Ari Þorgilsson, father of Icelandic historical writing; Snorri Sturluson, author of the famous &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, a collection of Norse myths; and Hallgrímur Pétursson, author of Iceland&#x27;s beloved Passion Hymns. Leading poets include Bjarni Thorarensen and Jónas Hallgrímsson, pioneers of the Romantic movement in Iceland; Matthías Jochumsson, author of Iceland&#x27;s national anthem; Þorsteinn Erlingsson, lyricist; Einar Hjörleifsson Kvaran, a pioneer of realism in Icelandic literature and an outstanding short-story writer; Einar Benediktsson, ranked as one of the greatest modern Icelandic poets; Jóhann Sigurjónsson, who lived much of his life in Denmark and wrote many plays based on Icelandic history and legend, as well as poetry; and the novelist Halldór Laxness, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1955.

Stefán Stefánsson was the pioneer Icelandic botanist. Helgi Pjeturss, geologist and philosopher, was an authority on the Ice Age and the geology of Iceland. The former world chess champion Bobby Fischer became an Icelandic citizen in 2005. Russian pianist and composer Vladimir Ashkenazy has been a citizen since 1972.

== Language ==
The principal language of Iceland is Icelandic, a highly inflected North Germanic language. Danish and English are also taught in schools. Linguistic purism is strongly supported in Iceland to prevent loanwords from entering the language. Instead, neologisms are coined from Icelandic roots, creating a compound word to describe new concepts. For example, the word for computer (an introduced object) is &quot;tölva&quot; which combines the ancient terms for number and seer. It is often the case that old words which are no longer used are recycled with a new meaning.

== Leisure ==

Though changing in the past years, Icelanders remain a very healthy nation. Children and teenagers participate in various types of leisure activities. Popular sports today are mainly soccer, athletics, handball and basketball. Sports such as tennis, swimming, chess and horseback riding are also popular.

Chess has historically been a common pastime in Iceland. The country&#x27;s chess clubs have produced chess grandmasters such as Friðrik Ólafsson, Jóhann Hjartarson, Margeir Pétursson, and Jón Loftur Árnason. &quot;Glíma&quot; is a form of wrestling that is still practiced in Iceland, thought to have originated with the Vikings. Golf is common; around 1 in 8 Icelanders play the sport. Handball is often referred to as a national sport, Iceland&#x27;s team is one of the top ranked teams in the world, and Icelandic women are surprisingly good at soccer compared to the size of the country, the national team ranked the 18th best by FIFA.

Ice climbing and rock climbing are favorites among many Icelanders, for example to climb the top of the 4,167-foot (1,270 metre) Þumall peak in Skaftafell is a challenge for many adventurous climbers, but mountain climbing is considered to be more suitable for the general public and is a very common type of leisure activity. Hvítá, among many other of the Icelandic glacial rivers, attracts kayakers and river rafters worldwide.

== Music ==
Icelandic music is related to Nordic music forms, and includes vibrant folk and pop traditions, including medieval music group Voces Thules. The only folk band whose recordings are available abroad is Islandica.

The national anthem of Iceland is &quot;Lofsöngur&quot;, composed by Matthías Jochumsson and Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson. The song was written in 1874, when Iceland celebrated the one thousandth anniversary of settlement on the island. It was in the form of a hymn, first published under the title &quot;A Hymn in Commemoration of Iceland&#x27;s Thousand Years&quot;.

== Religion ==
Norse Paganism was the primary religion among the Norsemen who settled Iceland in the 9th century AD. Christianity later came to Iceland around 1000 AD. In the middle of the 16th century, the Danish crown formally declared Lutheranism the state religion under the Icelandic Reformation. This increasing Christianization culminated in the Pietism period when non-Christian entertainments were discouraged. At present the population is overwhelmingly, if nominally, Lutheran (75.4% in 2017). Other denominations of Christianity are also practiced such as Catholicism and Mormonism. Other major religions that are practiced include Islam, Judaism, and various folk religions such as Ásatrúarfélagið. 

== Tourism ==
One of the most popular tourist attractions in Iceland is visiting the geothermal spas and pools that can be found all around the country, such as &quot;Bláa Lónið&quot; (The Blue Lagoon) on the Reykjanes Peninsula near the Keflavík International Airport.

== Transport ==
There are no railways in Iceland. The country has an extensive road network, and a ring road follows the coast, so that one can drive around the island. Road routes in some parts of the country (e.g. the Westfjords) are very circuitous, and many roads are closed for a long winter season, so air and sea transport are popular to connect remoter areas.

<text>Southern Connecticut State University (Southern Connecticut, Southern Connecticut State, SCSU, or simply &quot;Southern&quot;) is a public research university in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. Part of the Connecticut State University System, it was founded in 1893 and is governed by the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

== History ==
On September 11, 1893, &quot;New Haven State Normal School&quot;, a two-year teacher training school, was established. The Skinner School, a two-story building, was used as the first campus. It was situated on State Street at the corner of what was then known as Summer Street. Arthur Boothby Morrill served as the first principal of the Normal School from 1893 to 1924. Two female teachers and Morrill made up the faculty. Prospective students had to be at least 16 years of age, and typically had either a three year high school degree or two years teaching experience. There were 85 women in the first class. Tuition was free for students, in-state or out-of-state, as long as a declaration to complete their studies and teach in Connecticut was signed. All textbook materials were provided by the school. Boarding was available for between $3.50 and $4.00 a week, although the majority of the students were from New Haven and commuted.

The Skinner School was soon outgrown by the rapidly growing Normal School. In 1896, it was moved to a new building on Howe and Oak St. This was a better location because of its larger size and its proximity to several elementary schools where students could train. At this point, the Normal School could only award certificates in teaching to graduates.

By 1937 the school was able to grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and thus renamed &quot;New Haven State Teacher&#x27;s College&quot;. Graduate degrees were offered starting in 1954, a year after the school moved to its current campus on Crescent St.

New Haven State Teacher&#x27;s College became &quot;Southern Connecticut State College&quot; in 1959. In March 1983 the school was renamed &quot;Southern Connecticut State University&quot; and made part of the Connecticut State University System.

== Campus ==
Southern has one campus located at 501 Crescent Street, in New Haven, bordering parts of Hamden, Connecticut. Fitch Street separates the academic and residential sections of the campus. As part of an effort to expand on the university&#x27;s science programs, the laboratory science building was opened in 2015. The four-story building specializes with cancer research, physics and optics, along with other fields of sciences. The School of Business was moved from the renovated former student center to the new building on Wintergreen and Farnham Ave in Summer 2023. The building is the first building constructed by the State of Connecticut to utilize Net Zero Energy, and houses numerous conference rooms, a community room with seating for 100 people, offices for faculty, trading rooms, a 100-seat auditorium with tiered seating, and numerous study rooms for students.

== Academics ==
=== Teacher Education ===
Southern Connecticut State University remains a center for teacher education. Southern is the only school in Connecticut to offer a master&#x27;s degree concentration in autism spectrum disorders. The university received approval for its first doctoral program, an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership.

=== Nursing ===
NCLEX passing rates for Southern students hover between 90 and 100 percent in the past three decades.

=== Liberal Education Program ===
The LEP program consists of electives, and is a requirement for all majors. This program is meant to expose students to different types of classes outside side of their major. It is broken up into three tiers of classes and accounts for 42 credits of a student&#x27;s degree. Tier one includes Inquiry 101, Writing 102 and a couple other basic classes that are geared towards Freshmen. It also requires completion of a 200 level language course in any of 10 languages, including American Sign Language. Tier two is broken into 9 categories. Students are required to take one class for each category. The categories include American Experience, Cultural Expression, Creative Drive, Global Awareness, Mind and Body, Natural World I and II, Social Structure, and Time and Place. Tier Three is considered a &quot;Capstone&quot; and only one class is taken. Generally a student&#x27;s major requires a 300 or 400 level course in the major to complete this capstone. Every major is required to take 3 W or written intensive courses before graduating.

== Student life ==
=== Greek life ===
There are many Greek-lettered social organizations on campus. Each organization strives for the betterment of students. Each organization is unique in its make-up, beliefs, and traditions.

Here is a list of the fraternities and sororities that are active or inactive on campus.

== Library ==
Southern Connecticut State University&#x27;s Hilton C. Buley Library was named after Hilton C. Buley, the president of the New Haven State Teachers College which was a former name of the institution, from July 1, 1954, to February 18, 1971. He was an educator and administrator in New York, New Jersey, and Wisconsin prior to earning a doctorate degree from Columbia University. He served as an administrator in the New Hampshire public schools before joining Southern.
The first library was housed at 2 Howe Street, New Haven, the original home of the university which was then called New Haven Normal School and consisted of a reading room with two walls of wooden bookshelves and a stack area in the balcony on the third wall. When the school opened in 1893, the library contained 500 books. By 1950 a collection of over 28,000 books and 200 periodical subscriptions was crammed into the space which was originally intended for 10,000 volumes. The library&#x27;s move to the main building on Crescent Street, Engleman Hall, was accomplished in 1954 shortly before Buley came to Southern. By the year 1969 it contained over 200,000 volumes and was outgrowing its space yet again.

The dedication ceremony of a new Hilton C. Buley Library was held on October 31, 1970, a few months prior to the president&#x27;s retirement. The library could hold up to 500,000 volumes with flexible space that could accommodate an equal number of additional volumes. However, as the library&#x27;s collections kept growing, space was a major concern. When funding for a new addition and renovation to the existing library was approved by the legislature, a building planning committee was formed in 1999 with a new library building finally opening in March 2014.

The current library features four Tiffany Windows. Louis C. Tiffany (1848-1933), one of America&#x27;s most talented and renowned artists best known for his work in stained glass, created these beautiful pieces. Three of these, &quot;Angel of Praise&quot;, &quot;Water Brooks&quot;, and &quot;Hector&quot; are located on the south side of the Learning Commons area just behind the Reference Desk in large boxes to be viewed against natural light. These were donated to the university in the sixties from the First Center Church of Christ in New Haven. A fourth window, the &quot;Congregational window&quot;, was donated by the Congregational Church in the 1990s and is currently displayed in the second floor reading room. The windows were installed in the old library in 1972 but just before the building was renovated they were removed, restored by Serpentino Stained Glass Studio, and kept in storage till they were ready to be displayed.

The Water Brooks window (1898-1904) was created in memory of Ezekiel Hayes Trowbridge, a descendant of one of the founders of the Church, and is 54&quot; wide and 98&quot; high. The Hector, which was designed in 1898, is the ship which transported the early colonist to New Haven in 1638. The four corners of the window contain the four meeting houses of the congregation dated 1640, 1670, 1757, and 1814.

Library holdings include the Carolyn Sherwin Bailey&#x27;s Collection of Children&#x27;s Literature, Helen Liveten Juvenile Collection, William Cahn Labor Collection, Connecticut Collection, Eula H. Davies Napoleonica Collection, A.H. Gosselin Sound Collection, David Libbey Collection of Library Postcards, Edward G. Levy collection of Nineteenth Century Textbooks and Ephemera, Sherman Reilly Collection of Tracts, and the Artists&#x27; Book Collection. The university&#x27;s digital collections include American Publishers&#x27; Binding, 1829–1975; &quot;Connecticut Libraries&quot;, the newsletter of the Connecticut Library Association; Connecticut Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame containing samples of ephemera owned by women who belonged to the Hall of Fame; and the Libbey Library Postcard Collection consisting of over 1,400 library postcards donated by Dr. David Libbey, professor emeritus.

== Sustainability ==
On May 30, 2019, Southern officially declared a &quot;Climate Emergency&quot; after recent student advocacy and Faculty from the Department of the Environment, Geography and Marine Sciences advocating for the university to take stronger action in addressing climate change. This makes Southern the first university in the U.S. to make such a declaration.

<doc id="496399" wikidata="Q845419" url="?curid=496399" title="List of presidents of Lebanon">
<text>This is a list of presidents of Lebanon since the creation of the office in 1926. 

Constitutionally (&quot;de jure&quot;), the president&#x27;s post carries significant responsibilities and influence. In practice, the president is largely a ceremonial and symbolic post due to external pressure or the formation of &quot;consensus&quot; cabinets, forcing the president to compromise. In theory, however, the president is responsible for appointing the entire government, therefore the ministers should work to his pleasure. Nevertheless, the president is still able to exercise influence on policy-making and has the role, in conjunction with the prime minister, of choosing ministers in the Government and safeguarding the Constitution of Lebanon.

==National Pact==
Though it is not specifically stated in the constitution, an unwritten understanding known as the National Pact, agreed in 1943, has resulted in the holder of the post being a Maronite Christian in every electoral cycle since that time.

<text>Forbidden Zone is an American absurdist musical fantasy comedy film produced and directed by independent filmmaker Richard Elfman, and co-written by Elfman and Matthew Bright. Shot in 1977 and 1978, the film premiered in 1980 and was distributed in 1982. Originally shot on black-and-white film, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; is based upon the stage performances of the Los Angeles theater troupe The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, of which Elfman, Bright and many of the cast and crew were a part, and revolves around an alternate universe accessed through a door in the house of the Hercules family.

The composing debut of Danny Elfman, it stars Hervé Villechaize, Susan Tyrrell and members of the Mystic Knights, with appearances by Warhol superstar Viva, Joe Spinell and The Kipper Kids. Villechaize kicked his cheque back into production and even painted sets on weekends. The only paid actor was Phil Gordon, who played Flash; all the other SAG actors put their money back into the show.

The film was made as an attempt to capture the essence of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo&#x27;s live performances in a cinematic sense, and also as a means for both director Elfman to retire from music to work on film projects, and to serve as a transition between the group&#x27;s former cabaret style and a new wave-based style. Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had been perceived as being offensive, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; was screened as a midnight movie, where it was met with positive notices, and developed a large and eventually worldwide cult following. In 2004, the film was digitally restored and released on DVD, and in 2008, the film was colorized.

Said Elfman, &quot;Doing anything original is taking a chance. Financially it bankrupted me and we lost our house. But I&#x27;m still glad I did it (although I&#x27;d change a few things if I had a time machine, of course).&quot;

A prospective sequel, entitled &quot;Forbidden Zone 2: The Forbidden Galaxy&quot;, has long been in development by Elfman, who launched a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2014 to raise an initial sum. As of 2019, the sequel is still in the stages of development but regularly updated and discussed by Elfman. Elfman has also licensed &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; as an intellectual property for manufacturers to produce collectibles based on the film&#x27;s characters.

==Plot==
On &quot;Friday, April 17&quot; at 4 p.m. in Venice, California, Huckleberry P. Jones (pimp, narcotics peddler, and slumlord) enters a vacant house that he owns. While stashing heroin in the basement, he stumbles upon a mysterious door and enters it, falling into the Sixth Dimension, from which he promptly escapes. After retrieving the heroin, he sells the house to the Hercules family. On their way to school, Frenchy Hercules and her brother Flash talk with Squeezit Henderson, who says that, while being beaten by his mother, he has a vision of his transgender sister René, who had fallen into the Sixth Dimension through the door in the Hercules&#x27; basement.

Frenchy returns home to confide in her mother, and decides to take a &quot;little peek&quot; behind the basement&#x27;s forbidden door. There, she is captured by the perpetually topless Princess, who brings Frenchy to the rulers of the Sixth Dimension, the midget King Fausto and his queen, Doris. When the king falls for Frenchy, Doris orders their frog servant, Bust Rod, to lock her up. To make sure that Frenchy is not harmed, Fausto tells Bust Rod to take Frenchy to Cell 63, where the king keeps his favorite concubines (as well as René).

The next day at school, Flash tries to convince Squeezit to help him rescue René and Frenchy. When Squeezit refuses, Flash enlists the help of Gramps instead. In the Sixth Dimension, they speak to an old Jewish man who reveals how to help Frenchy escape, but they soon are captured by Bust Rod. Doris interrogates Flash and Gramps before lowering them into a septic tank. She then plots her revenge against Frenchy, relocating all the denizens of Cell 63 to a torture chamber. She leaves the Princess to oversee Frenchy&#x27;s torture and execution. However, when a fuse is blown, the torture is put on hold and the prisoners from Cell 63 are relocated to keep the King from finding them.

After escaping the tank, Flash and Gramps come across a woman who says that she was once happily married to the king, until Doris stole the throne by seducing her. The ex-queen has been sitting in her cell for 1,000 years, and has been writing a screenplay to keep her sanity. Meanwhile, Pa Hercules is blasted through the stratosphere by an explosion caused by improperly extinguishing his cigarette in a vat of flammable tar during his work break at the La Brea Tar Pit Factory. After re-entry, Pa falls through the basement and into the Sixth Dimension, where he is imprisoned.

Finding a phone, Flash calls Squeezit and again asks for his help. Squeezit agrees to help rescue Frenchy and René. In the Sixth Dimension, he is captured by Satan, with whom he makes a deal to bring him the Princess in exchange for Satan&#x27;s help freeing René and Frenchy. Squeezit accomplishes this task, but failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends, and the devil has him decapitated. Queen Doris sends Bust Rod to keep an eye on the king, and to ensure he does not find out where she has hidden Frenchy.

Fausto catches Bust Rod and forces him to lead him to Frenchy and René, whom he orders to leave the Sixth Dimension to avoid the Queen&#x27;s wrath. However, en route to safety, René is stricken with pseudo-menstrual cramps, and they are again captured by the frog. Squeezit&#x27;s head, which has now sprouted chicken wings, finds the king and reveals what has happened.

While preparing to kill Frenchy, Doris is confronted by the ex-queen, and the two engage in a cat-fight; Doris eventually coming out as the victor. Just as she is about to kill Frenchy, Fausto stops her, explaining that Satan&#x27;s Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo are holding the Princess hostage, and will kill her should anything befall Frenchy. Flash and Gramps arrive, and Flash is knocked down by Gramps. Ma Hercules enters and, seeing a seemingly dead Flash, shoots Doris. Fausto mourns Doris, then marries Frenchy.

The surviving characters later plan to take over everyone and everything in the Galaxy.

==Production==
===Development===
The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo were formed in late 1972 by Richard Elfman, as a musical theatre troupe. As Richard&#x27;s interest shifted to filmmaking, he passed leadership of the band to younger brother Danny Elfman. Danny, who had begun to lose interest in musical theatre, had gained interest in other musical styles such as ska, and had become &quot;sick of lugging around so much stuff with the theatre troupe. Towards the end&quot;, he remembers, &quot;it was a big production... there was, like a semi full of stuff. And that was becoming burdensome. So, for me, the idea of being a band that can fit all their gear into a van and set up in a club, and an hour later be playing, became a goal.&quot; Production began during a transitional period when the group was moving from its cabaret style towards a more pop/rock format; by the time the film was completed, the band had shortened its name to Oingo Boingo.

The film was originally conceived as &quot;The Hercules Family&quot;, a 16mm musical that consisted of twelve musical numbers and a story loosely constructed around them. But as the project grew to 35mm and the storyline evolved, Richard Elfman found himself re-shooting many of the original scenes to fit the new film. Two sequences from the original 16mm footage were featured on the 2004 DVD release: one of Danny Elfman, as Satan, performing &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; (later reshot with visual elements borrowed from the original 16mm sequence and alternate lyrics), and another of Marie-Pascale Elfman, singing &quot;Johnny&quot;. The sequence with Elfman as Satan, and members of the Oingo Boingo as his minions, came from live shows, in which the band would perform Cab Calloway tunes like &quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot; in the same costumes.

Marie-Pascale Elfman, at the time of shooting, was married to director Richard Elfman. She designed the film&#x27;s expressionistic sets and starred in the film. Actor and former Mystic Knight Gene Cunningham helped fund the film. When Cunningham and Elfman ran out of money during production, Richard and Marie-Pascale Elfman helped finance by selling houses, before Carl Borack put money into the production in order for Elfman to complete the film. According to Elfman, he had originally intended the film to be screened in color, stating that the original plan was to ship the film to China, where each frame would be hand-tinted, but that this plan was not practical within the production costs. Elfman ultimately went bankrupt during the production of &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; and had to assign the rights away in order to finish the film; in 2015, Elfman regained the full rights to &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;.

===Casting===
Actor Hervé Villechaize was a former roommate of co-writer and co-star Matthew Bright; Villechaize had previously dated co-star Susan Tyrrell. The Elfmans&#x27; grandfather, Herman Bernstein, also appeared in the film, and Richard Elfman&#x27;s accountant appeared under the name &quot;Hyman Diamond&quot; because Elfman had no idea whether or not he wanted to be credited. Others who worked on the film include The Kipper Kids (Brian Routh and Martin von Haselberg), Joe Spinell, and former Warhol superstar Viva.

===Writing===
&quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; featured Bright&#x27;s first work on film, and his only work as an actor (under the name &quot;Toshiro Baloney&quot;). A founding member of the Mystic Knights, Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right. Bright&#x27;s credits include &quot;Freeway&quot;, &quot;Ted Bundy&quot;, and &quot;Tiptoes&quot;. Bright and director Richard Elfman&#x27;s only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have any sense of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you know, I was just, didn&#x27;t know what I was doing. I needed reining in.&quot; During filming, Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital. When Bright returned to work the next day, he had a mild concussion and whiplash, but he continued with filming.

===Directing===
Richard Elfman had never gone to film school when production started, and &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what I was getting into.&quot; The production, from its original 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film&#x27;s stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film&#x27;s artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film&#x27;s cast was made up of non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of &quot;Bim Bam Boom&quot;, but when he was put in front of the camera, he stood there as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright&#x27;s lips over the actor&#x27;s face. Another scene featured homeless men.

===Animation===
The film&#x27;s animation was created by then-unknown animator John Muto. Because of the film&#x27;s low budget, Muto created all of the film&#x27;s animation sequences himself. Muto made frequent use of airbrush techniques to establish for himself a distinctive style. For sequences in which live-action and animation were combined, the actors were photographed in tight head-on and profile shots, and the photos were cut out and pasted into the animation in a style recalling Terry Gilliam&#x27;s work on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. Muto also credits the Fleischer Brothers as another inspiration.

===Music===

&quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; was the first film scored by Danny Elfman, who would eventually score, among other films, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. The song &quot;Witch&#x27;s Egg&quot; was written by Georg Michalski and Tyrrell. In some scenes, characters lip synch to old records, including recordings by Cab Calloway, Josephine Baker, and others.

The alphabet song performed in a classroom scene was inspired by the &quot;Swinging the Alphabet&quot; song from The Three Stooges short &quot;Violent Is the Word for Curly&quot;.

For the &quot;Yiddishe Charleston&quot; scene, Richard Elfman had shot the sequence with him lip-syncing to an old recording of the song, but was later unable to acquire the rights to the recording, and had to record a new version of the song while attempting to sync the new recording with the footage.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack has also become popular, and its theme song was eventually reused by Danny Elfman, who rearranged it as &quot;The Dilbert Zone&quot; for use as the theme for the television series &quot;Dilbert&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; premiered at the Los Angeles Filmex film festival in 1980. The film played at the New Beverly Cinema as a midnight movie beginning March 28, and added three theatres in San Francisco, Seattle, and Columbus in May. The film received another limited theatrical release through The Samuel Goldwyn Company in 1982. Following its theatrical run, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; fell out of circulation for roughly twenty years, though bootleg recordings helped find the film new life as a highly sought-after and well-regarded cult film. In 2004, &quot;Film Threat&quot; magazine dubbed &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of underground movies&quot;. the film has a score of 83% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.6/10.

===Home media===
The film was digitally restored and released on Region 1 DVD by Fantoma in 2004, receiving a Region 2 release by Arrow Film Distributors Ltd. in 2006. In 2008, with Elfman&#x27;s blessing and input, a colorized version of &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; was issued on DVD by Legend Films, and was later screened in exhibition at the New York Museum of Modern Art in 2010. Arrow released a Blu-Ray edition in the UK in 2012, followed by &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; North American Blu-Ray and DVD releases by MVD Entertainment Group in 2015; all contained both the black-and-white and color versions.

===Controversies===
Upon its original release, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; was singled out for criticism for its use of broadly-drawn racist, homophobic, antisemitic and anti-Christian visuals and characters. Elfman, himself of Jewish heritage, has disputed many of these accusations, noting that elements seen as homophobic were inspired by his time as a director and occasional performer in the San Francisco avant-garde drag troupe The Cockettes, while the character of &quot;Mr. Bernstein&quot;, accused of being an exaggerated Jewish stereotype, was played by Elfman&#x27;s Jewish grandfather Herman Bernstein, of whom Elfman wryly asserted &quot;wasn&#x27;t acting&quot;.

In particular, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; has been criticized for its brief use of surreal blackface. In 2020, Elfman digitally removed the blackface images and replaced them with &quot;clown-face&quot;. In an interview with Dread Central, he explained &quot;Going back to our very first test screening in 1980, there were a few things that really bugged me. The film is an absurdist fever-dream with hundreds of crazy, cartoonish images. I regretted the few seconds of Max Fleischer-era black-face and wanted to change it to &#x27;clown-face&#x27;. But the film hadliterallybankrupted me, I had lost control and couldn&#x27;t complete it exactly the way I wanted. Well, forty years later, I fucking can!&quot;. Elfman&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut was released in early 2021.

==Legacy==
===Sequel===
In June 2009, it was revealed through an entry on IMDb that Elfman had been developing a sequel to &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; entitled &quot;Forbidden Zone 2: The Forbidden Galaxy&quot;. The prospective project was more formally detailed in March 2014 when Elfman launched a successful crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo to raise part of the film&#x27;s financing. As of the campaign&#x27;s most recent update in May 2023, Elfman confirmed the project is &quot;still alive&quot; and noting that he &quot;will not give up on FZ2&quot;, describing &quot;Forbidden Zone 2&quot; as &quot;number one on his .&quot; &quot;As long as I am breathing, I will do Forbidden Zone 2!&quot;

===Stage show===
In 2010, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; was performed as a live stage show with the support of Richard Elfman. It is a production of the Sacred Fools Theater Company, and premiered there in Los Angeles on Friday, May 21, 2010.

===Mixed media===
Richard Elfman entered into a licensing deal with the creative resource company, PANGEA, to provide licensees with the opportunity to create merchandise based on the cult film. According to articles that appeared in the media on May 3, 2016, the arrangement calls for content to be created that will include a Storyboard Book of the original film, featuring commentary and anecdotal notes from director. Shot glasses and sculpted pieces were among the list of immediate items that would be released. A fantasy novella series was also noted as being under development.

&quot;Rocky Horror&quot; &quot;shadow cast&quot; companies have begun performing screenings of the film. Elfman sometimes participates in these live performances. He enters in a clown suit and beats a big bass drum that is accompanied by a Brazilian percussion ensemble—reminiscent of his former group, the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo.

The Syfy Channel has run a teaser piece musical number, &quot;Princess Polly&quot; from &quot;Forbidden Zone 2: The Forbidden Galaxy&quot; on its show &quot;The Monster Man,&quot; starring Cleve Hall. Elfman opens the Forbidden Zone shadow cast shows (after the march in) with Erin Holt singing Princess Polly live in front of her screened “monster” image on stage.

<doc id="496403" wikidata="Q298286" url="?curid=496403" title="Mikhail Chigorin">
<text>Mikhail Ivanovich Chigorin (also &quot;Tchigorin&quot;; ; – ) was a Russian chess player. He played two World Championship matches against Wilhelm Steinitz, losing both times. The last great player of the Romantic chess style, he also served as a major source of inspiration for the &quot;Soviet chess school&quot;, which dominated the chess world in the middle and latter parts of the 20th century.

==Chess career==
Chigorin was born in Gatchina but moved to nearby Saint Petersburg some time later. His father worked in the Okhtensk gunpowder works. Chigorin&#x27;s parents died young and Chigorin entered the Gatchinsk Orphans&#x27; Institute at the age of 10. He became serious about chess uncommonly late in life; his schoolteacher taught him the moves at the age of 16, but he did not take to the game until around 1874, having first finished his studies before commencing a career as a government officer.

Once smitten with the game, he terminated his employment and started life as a chess professional. In 1876, he started a chess magazine, &quot;Chess Sheet&quot;, which he edited until 1881 (only 250 subscribers in all of Russia). He played a series of matches with established masters Emanuel Schiffers (1878–1880) and Semyon Alapin (1880) and notched up a large plus score against each. It was not long after that he was regarded as the best player in the city and possibly the whole of Russia.

His first international tournament was Berlin 1881, where he was equal third (+10−5=1) with Szymon Winawer, behind Johannes Zukertort and Joseph Henry Blackburne. This event included 17 master competitors. 

At the great London tournament of 1883, he finished fourth (+16−10=0) behind Zukertort, Wilhelm Steinitz and Blackburne. The 14 competitors in this double round robin event included practically all of the best chessplayers in the world.

At the very strong tournament of New York 1889 he was equal first with Max Weiss. Following this great success he challenged the world champion Steinitz for a match with the World Championship at stake.

The World Championship match was played at Havana in 1889, but he lost 10½–6½ (+6−10=1). A second World Championship match was played also at Havana in 1892, but he narrowly lost 12½–10½ (+8−10=5). 

His overall record against Steinitz was very close (+24−27=8). He also played a much publicised &#x27;telegraph match&#x27; against Steinitz in 1890, devised to settle a theoretical argument. Chigorin had the slight advantage of choosing the openings in advance from a list supplied by Steinitz and duly won both games.

Towards the end of the century, his standing at home and abroad continued to rise, and he was in the world&#x27;s top four or five players. His reputation as a match player too, continued to grow. He drew an 1893 match with Siegbert Tarrasch in Saint Petersburg (+9−9=4) and in his lifetime, maintained a narrow plus score against Tarrasch (+14−13=8), who was a fearsome player in his own right. He had a strong plus score against Richard Teichmann (+8−3=1), but a poor record versus David Janowski (+4−17=4). Most of his losses to Janowski occurred late in Chigorin&#x27;s life, when he was past his best.

In all likelihood, his best performance occurred at the Hastings 1895 chess tournament, where he placed second, ahead of reigning world champion Emanuel Lasker, Tarrasch and former world champion Steinitz. All of the greatest players of the time participated in the event and Chigorin&#x27;s outstanding result included winning his individual encounter with tournament victor, Harry Nelson Pillsbury. Pillsbury had great respect for Chigorin&#x27;s ability and for good reason, as Chigorin had a marginal lifetime plus score against him (+8−7=6). Although Chigorin had a poor record against Lasker in serious play (+1−8=4), he was victorious with the black pieces in their first game of this 1895 tournament, in which he outplayed Lasker in a classic two knights versus two bishops ending.

In other major competitions, he was joint winner at Budapest 1896, and beat Rudolf Charousek (+3−1) in the playoff. At Cologne in 1898, he was equal second with Charousek and Wilhelm Cohn after Amos Burn. His 7th-place finish at London 1899 was disappointing in comparison, but this was another tournament notable for its impressive list of participants. At Monte Carlo 1901, he placed equal third after Janowski and Carl Schlechter.

A highly skilled exponent of gambit lines, he won the King&#x27;s Gambit-themed Vienna Tournament of 1903 and defeated Lasker (+2−1=3) in a sponsored Rice Gambit tournament in Brighton. The latter was however something of a hollow victory, as it was emerging that the Rice Gambit was unsound and so, playing the black side in each game gave him a distinct advantage. He was also perhaps the most skilled 19th century practitioner of the Evans Gambit, which featured in many of his great duels with Steinitz. At Łódź 1906, in a four-person event, he finished second to Akiba Rubinstein.

Alongside these international events, he also entered and won the first three All-Russia Tournaments of 1899, 1900/01 and 1903. These prestigious successes further cemented his reputation as Russia&#x27;s best player. Upon losing the fourth such event in 1906, he challenged the winner Gersz Salwe to a match and came out the victor (+7−5=3).

==Style and demeanour==
His playing style featured a well-honed tactical ability and an imaginative approach to the opening. He rejected many of the inflexible doctrines put forward by Tarrasch and Steinitz, but accepted Steinitz&#x27; teachings about the soundness of the defensive centre. Indeed, he went on to add to the development of the concept through the work he carried out with closed variations of the Ruy Lopez. He also pioneered some variations of the Slav Defence. A large bearded man, Chigorin was described as &#x27;decidedly handsome&#x27;.

Frank Marshall once commented on the highly agitated state that would possess Chigorin when faced with difficult positions. Aside from the usual frantic foot-tapping and crossing of legs, he would occasionally become &quot;a bundle of nerves&quot;, at which point his temperament could turn &quot;quite fierce&quot;.

==Later life==

As an ambassador for Russian chess, Chigorin was a shining example; he gave many lectures, wrote magazine articles and chess columns and subsidised or otherwise supported a number of periodicals to keep them afloat despite low readership levels. He also founded a chess club in Saint Petersburg and tried for many years to establish a chess association, an attempt that finally succeeded just a few years after his death.

According to the Canadian International Master Lawrence Day, Chigorin travelled with the young Fedor Bogatyrchuk to Russian events in the 1905–1907 period, helping to train him. After moving to Canada following World War II, Bogatyrchuk then trained Day.

By 1907, Chigorin&#x27;s health (both mental and physical) started to decline dramatically. He failed badly in a chess tournament. He was clearly not in good health and was diagnosed by doctors in Carlsbad with an advanced and untreatable case of diabetes. This prompted a prediction that he had only months to live, whereupon he returned to his estranged wife and daughter in Lublin and died the following January. Not long before he died Chigorin had an emotional outburst and burned his chess set. In 1909, a Chigorin Memorial tournament was played in St. Petersburg. After that many more followed: from 1947 onwards mainly in Sochi and from 1990 back in Saint Petersburg.

==Legacy==

Through his original talent, lively games and prolific teachings, many Russians regard Mikhail Chigorin as the founder of their &quot;School of chess&quot;, later to become known as the Soviet School of Chess. Overshadowed to some extent in the 1920s by the exciting new theories of the hypermodern movement, Chigorin&#x27;s influence nevertheless demands a prominent and permanent place in the Soviet chess hegemony of the 20th century.

===Openings===

Chigorin has several chess openings or variations of openings named after him, the two most important being the Chigorin Variation of the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Qc7) and the Chigorin Defence to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nc6). Whilst the former has remained popular through the 1900s, the latter struggled to attract a great many devotees until relatively recently. Igor Miladinović has used the Chigorin Defence with great regularity, but its current revival owes much to the efforts of Alexander Morozevich, who has championed the opening both in play and in his book – &quot;The Chigorin Defence According To Morozevich&quot; (published 2007).

Another opening line invented by Chigorin is 1.e4 e6 2.Qe2 in the French Defence. It is now generally regarded as a forerunner of King&#x27;s Indian setups, but Chigorin also played it with other ideas (such as b2–b3) in mind.

==In popular culture==
A famous Chigorin game played against Steinitz in 1892 is used as the base for the plot of &quot;The Squares of the City&quot;, a 1965 science-fiction novel by John Brunner.

<text>Sherman Martin Austin (born April 10, 1983) is an American anarchist and musician who was arrested for inflammatory content on his website and subsequently convicted. He was the first person to be successfully prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 842(p), a United States federal law which makes the distribution of information on explosives unlawful if the information is provided with the knowledge or intent that the information will be used to commit a violent federal crime. Austin was convicted under a plea agreement in 2002 and served a one-year sentence in federal prison. Some academics and activists, including Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine, protested the prosecution of Austin.

== Investigation, conviction and imprisonment ==

===Background===
Prior to his arrest and imprisonment, Austin was webmaster of the Internet site RaisetheFist.com (subtitled &quot;National Security is the Threat&quot;), which provides a platform for discussion for anti-police activists, and provides suggestions on how to practice for possible armed combat with police.

On May 1, 2001, the FBI received information about a possible server intrusion and defacement of the Web site of the James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness. The information contained on that Web site&#x27;s home page had been deleted and replaced with politically militant rhetoric. In addition, the coding for this and a number of other defaced sites contained links to RaisetheFist.com, while responsibility was claimed by a group calling itself &quot;UCAUN&quot;, which was Sherman Austin&#x27;s personal online username for a number of IRC clients, including AIM Instant Messenger.

===Conviction===
On August 4, 2003, after entering a guilty plea under an agreement with the prosecutor, Austin was sentenced in U.S. District Court by Judge Stephen V. Wilson to 12 months in a federal jail, a $2000 fine, and three years probation, and as well as other restrictions. His time was served in a federal institution in Tucson, Arizona.

Austin has claimed that he never authored the explosives information, although he freely hosted it on his webserver. He says he took the plea deal because of the possibility of a 20-year sentence due to a &quot;terrorism enhancement&quot; clause in the USA Patriot Act.

Austin was not indicted for any alleged hacking crimes. However, he has acknowledged defacing the sites, saying it was necessary to get his message out.

===Release===

Austin was released one month early in July 2004 with 3 years of probation which prohibited him from having access to a computer or knowingly associating with individuals who &quot;espouse violence for political change&quot;.

Following his release from prison, he released a hip-hop CD, &quot;Silence is Defeat&quot;.

In February 2006, Austin released a statement on Indymedia containing claims that the National Security Agency had installed illegal wiretaps before and during the investigation against him, and that the NSA, along with &quot;other higher-ups in the government&quot;, arranged three separate attempts to assassinate him. Austin says that anonymous informants provided him with &quot;some detail on who was serving the contracts, names, license plate numbers, etc&quot;, by anonymous informants, and that these informants also assured him that everything was being taken care of and he was being &quot;looked out for&quot;.

==Criticism of Austin&#x27;s prosecution==

Some have questioned whether Austin&#x27;s trial was fair. Austin&#x27;s supporters consider him a political prisoner. Since his arrest, Austin has become a cause célèbre on the internet, with many sites dedicated to freeing Austin. Zack de la Rocha, lead vocalist of the band Rage Against the Machine, came out in support of Austin, and other musicians and bands, including Far East Movement and Death to W, supported Austin as well by having a benefit show at the Ché Café in San Diego, CA.

Leslie Kendrick, arguing for the adoption of a standard for determining whether speech is &quot;criminally instructive,&quot; has questioned whether Austin&#x27;s sentence was fair given the available evidence. As she notes, the law protects both (a) speech that is intended to incite a violent crime, but is not actually likely to do so, and (b) speech that is likely to incite a violent crime, but is not actually intended to do so. The Department of Justice prosecutor recommended a sentence of four months in jail and four months in a halfway house, but the judge rejected that plea twice and ordered a twelve-month sentence in jail, saying the prosecution was not &quot;taking this case seriously enough.&quot; Writing of Austin, Kendrick says, &quot;Too little information is available to make a complete assessment either of Austin&#x27;s intent or the likely use of his website by others.… Judge Wilson&#x27;s difference of opinion with the Justice Department prosecutor (the very agency that had contributed to the drafting of the Feinstein Amendment) illustrates the degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the danger imposed by the activities of individuals like [him].&quot;

Carnegie Mellon University professor David S. Touretzky posted a mirror of the &quot;Reclaim Guide&quot; on his Web site in reaction to the FBI raid on Austin, in order to prompt public debate. As Touretzky notes on his website, his own distribution of the material does not violate the statute because it is not performed with the intention or knowledge that the information be used to commit any illegal violent acts. On his website, Touretzky distances himself from Austin&#x27;s politics, which he characterizes as &quot;mindless,&quot; and suggests that the hacking evidence alone would be enough to arrest and charge Austin. But he is deeply troubled by the way the government handled the case:

&quot;Did the amateurish bomb-making information, written by a minor, that Mr. Austin allowed to appear on his web site pose any significant threat to public safety? Did he personally intend to promote crimes of violence? Because he was coerced (with the threat of a possible 20 year &#x27;terrorism enhancement&#x27;) into signing a plea agreement, the government was spared the trouble of a public trial, and thus did not have to prove its case or enter its evidence against him into the public record. How then can we, the American people, judge whether our government acted reasonably in this matter?&quot;

<text>Central Connecticut State University (Central Connecticut, CCSU, Central Connecticut State, or informally Central) is a public university in New Britain, Connecticut. Founded in 1849 as the State Normal School, CCSU is Connecticut&#x27;s oldest publicly-funded university. It is made up of four schools: the Ammon College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences; the School of Business; the School of Education and Professional Studies; and the School of Engineering, Science, and Technology. As of Spring 2022, the university was attended by 8,898 students: 7,054 undergraduate students and 1,844 graduate students. More than half of students live off campus and 96 percent are Connecticut residents. The school is part of the Connecticut State Colleges &amp; Universities system (CSCU), which also oversees Eastern, Western, and Southern Connecticut State Universities.

==History==
Central Connecticut State University was founded in 1849 as the State Normal School to train teachers. It was the sixth normal school in the United States and is the oldest public university in Connecticut. It ran until 1867 when the school was temporarily closed due to opposition in the Connecticut General Assembly. Two years later, the Normal School resumed its services and continued to do so until the 1930s. In 1933, the Connecticut General Assembly created the Teachers College of Connecticut and the first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were granted. In 1922, the campus moved to its current location on Stanley Street. In Fall 2023, the university unveiled its new logo.

The school was again renamed in 1959, becoming the Central Connecticut State College.

In 1983, the school transitioned from a college to a regional university and thus became Central Connecticut State University. Organizational governance changed in 2011 when the Connecticut Department of Higher Education was dissolved and replaced by the Office of Higher Education and the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education.

==Facilities==
Facilities include 10 academic halls, the Student Center, the Burritt Library, and numerous laboratories. Computer labs are available throughout campus, the largest of which is located in Marcus White Hall. Dining facilities are located in Memorial Hall, Hilltop Dining Center, and the Student Center. Additional computers and laboratories are spread across all of the academic halls. Welte Hall, Maloney Hall, and the Student Center function as large gathering areas for events, music performances, and theater productions. Welte contains the main auditorium and Kaiser Hall houses the main gymnasium, and houses an Olympic-size pool. Fitness classes are freely available to students in Memorial Hall and fitness equipment is provided in four locations across campus through RECentral.

Administrative offices, including Admissions, the Registrar, and Financial Aid are located in Davidson Hall. New building projects have expanded liberal arts classroom space and made significant upgrades to all sports facilities.

===Residence halls and commuters===
Residence halls can accommodate up to 2,500 students in nine residence halls in two quads, which are split between the north and south ends of campus.

===Recent projects===
A new eight-story residence hall (Mid Campus Residence Hall) opened for occupancy in the Fall of 2015. The $82 million dorm features &quot;suite&quot; style rooms, in addition to a 2,000 square foot fitness facility, a kitchen on each floor, and a server kitchen and main lounge with a fireplace on the main floor. The Office of Residence Life is located on the first floor of the new facility.

By 2015, a new $37-million Social Sciences Hall, 4,300-square-foot Bichum Engineering Laboratory, and 12,500-square-foot Campus Police Station opened. In 2011, the first floor of the Elihu Burritt Library was renovated to create a new common area with seating, couches, computers, and food vendors. Arute Field and its adjacent practice and baseball fields also underwent extensive construction and renovation from 2010 through the present, including new football, soccer, track, and practice field turf. New football, track, and soccer stadium seating were added, as well as construction on the Balf–Savin baseball field.

==Academics==
There are over 400 full-time faculty, 83% of whom possess the terminal degree in their field. Another 501 part-time instructors also teach at the university.

===Rankings===
In 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Central Connecticut State University tied for No.66 in Regional Universities North, tied for No.24 in Top Public Schools, No.50 in Best Value Schools, tied for No.190 in Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs at schools where a doctorate is not offered, tied for No.392 in Nursing, Nos.293-318 in Economics, tied for No.29 in Best Colleges for Veterans, 132 in Top Performers on Social Mobility. 

===Undergraduate admissions===

In 2024, Central Connecticut State University accepted 76.7% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered very easy, applicant competition considered very low, and with those enrolled having an average 3.2 high school GPA. The university does not require submission of standardized test scores, but they will be considered when submitted. Those enrolled that submitted test scores had an average 1050 SAT score (53% submitting scores) or an average 21 ACT score (1% submitting scores).

===Graduate programs===
Graduate programs are in all of the academic schools. These include programs in accountancy, education, literature, international studies, engineering technology, and information technology. A number of doctoral degrees are also offered.
