<text>The &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 or 400 Richest Americans is a list published by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine of the wealthiest 400 American citizens who own assets in the U.S., ranked by net worth. The 400 was started by Malcolm Forbes in 1982 and the list is published annually around September. Peter W. Bernstein and Annalyn Swan describe the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 as capturing &quot;a period of extraordinary individual and entrepreneurial energy, a time unlike the extended postwar years, from 1945 to 1982, when American society emphasized the power of corporations.&quot; Bernstein and Swan also describe it as representing &quot;a powerful argument – and sometimes a dream – about the social value of wealth in contemporary America.&quot;

Since 2014, &quot;Forbes&quot; has published a &quot;self-made score&quot; alongside the list, indicating the degree to which each &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 member is responsible for their own wealth.

==Criteria==
The &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 is a report of who has the most wealth in the United States. They annually create a list of the richest people in America to exhibit the shape of the economy. The magazine displays the story of someone&#x27;s rise to fame, their company, age, industrial residence, and education. The list portrays the financial shift of trends, leadership positions, and growing philanthropy intentions.

==History==

===First list (1982)===
In the first &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 list, there were only 13 billionaires, and a net worth of million secured a spot on the list. The 1982 list represented 2.8% of the Gross Domestic Product of the United States. The 1982 &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 had 22.8% of the list composed of oil fortunes, with 15.3% from manufacturing, 9% from finance and only 3% from technology-driven fortunes. The state of New York had the most representation on the list with 77 members, followed by California with 48.

===2000===
In the year 2000, &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 saw the highest percent of the gross domestic product represented by the list at 12.2% driven by the internet boom.

===2021===
By 2021, calculated using stock prices from September 3, 2021, the minimum net worth to make the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 was $2.9 billion; the top billionaire on the list, Jeff Bezos, was worth over $200 billion; and the collective fortunes of the 400 reached $4.5 trillion. In the 39 years since the first list, the minimum net worth to make the list had increased over 38-fold, or 3866% (from $75 million to $2.9 billion), while basic consumer price inflation had risen less than 300% (or less than 3-fold). 

===Controversies===
In April 2018, an ex-&quot;Forbes&quot; reporter Jonathan Greenberg alleged that Donald Trump had inflated his actual wealth in order to be included on the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 listing. Greenberg provided original audio recordings of his 1984 exchange with &quot;John Barron&quot;, one of the pseudonyms used by Donald Trump, and eventually included Trump at the end of the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 list at $100 million, one fifth of the $500 million which &quot;Barron&quot; was claiming as Donald Trump&#x27;s net worth. This figure was later corrected and, following civil proceedings years later, Trump admitted the name was fabricated.

==Self-made score==
&quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; self-made score rates each member of the list on a scale of 1 to 10. A score of 1 is given to those who inherited their fortune and have not worked to increase or manage it. A score of 10 is given to those who both grew up poor and overcame significant obstacles. Forbes characterizes members with a rating of 6 or above as &quot;self-made&quot;. For the 2022 edition, this places slightly over two-thirds of the members in the self-made category.

The self-made score has been invoked in discussions about inherited wealth, economic mobility, and related subjects, with some commentators supporting &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; characterization of the list&#x27;s members, and others challenging it. In September 2012, the Institute for Policy Studies claimed that &quot;over 60 percent&quot; of the &quot;Forbes&quot; richest 400 Americans &quot;grew up in substantial privilege&quot;. They note that wealthy parents can bestow their children with privileges other than a large inheritance, such as paying for expensive tuition. In contrast, the Chicago Booth endorses the claim that most of the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 are self-made, while emphasizing that the list&#x27;s share of entrepreneurs has increased from 40% in 1982 to 69% in 2014.

==Demographics==
A few articles draw on the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 to test an evolutionary hypothesis called the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts that parents of high socioeconomic status produce more male offspring than parents of lower socioeconomic status. Whereas a 2009 study using data on the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 shows a strong effect for U.S. billionaires that is consistent with the Trivers–Willard hypothesis, a 2013 study shows some caveats: First, the result is only consistent for male, but not female, billionaires. Second, it can only be found among heirs and not self-made billionaires.

This has to do with the timing of wealth accumulation: some self-made billionaires had their children before they were rich, but heirs, by definition, were rich before ever becoming parents (see also ). Third, the size of the effect was largely overestimated, given that the male offspring of billionaires as compared to female offspring is easier to find on the Web: Women sometimes change their last name upon marriage which makes some harder to find. Therefore, earlier reports on the male bias among billionaire offspring were partially an artifact of sample selection.

In 2010, a &quot;Business Insider&quot; ethnic-demographic breakdown of the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 richest Americans found three gay people, four Asian Indians, six (non-Indian) Asians, and 34 women on the list. American Jews made up as many as 30% of the richest 100, and (in 2009) 139 of the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400. In 2017, just two African Americans made the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400: media proprietor Oprah Winfrey and tech investor Robert Smith; only five of the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 have Latino backgrounds.

<doc id="496627" wikidata="Q1190190" url="?curid=496627" title="List of monarchs of Carthage">
<text>Until 308 BC Carthage was ruled, at least officially, by monarchs, in the sense of the word that executive power was held by one person. It also seems for the time period below to have been passed down in the clan of the Magonids. The title itself was most likely Suffete.

[[Hannids|Hannonids]]
* Hanno I c. 580 – c. 556 BC
* Malchus c. 556 – c. 550 BC

[[Magonids]]
* Mago I c. 550 – c. 530 BC
* Hasdrubal I c. 530 – c. 510 BC
* Hamilcar I c. 510–480 BC
* Hanno II 480–440 BC
* Himilco I (in Sicily) 460–410 BC
* Hannibal I 440–406 BC
* Himilco II 406–396 BC
* Mago II 396–375 BC
* Mago III 375–344 BC
* Hanno III 344–340 BC

[[Hannonian monarchs|Hannonids]]
* Hanno I 340–337 BC
* Gisco 337–330 BC
* Hamilcar II 330–309 BC
* Bomilcar 309–308 BC

In 480 BC, following Hamilcar I&#x27;s death, the king lost most of his power to an aristocratic Council of Elders. In 308 BC, Bomilcar attempted a coup to restore the monarch to full power, but failed, which led to Carthage becoming a republic.

<doc id="496633" wikidata="Q2471913" url="?curid=496633" title="UUHash">
<text>UUHash is a hash algorithm employed by clients on the FastTrack network. It is employed for its ability to hash very large files in a very short period of time, even on older computers. However, this is achieved by only hashing a fraction of the file. This weakness makes it trivial to create a hash collision, allowing large sections to be completely altered without altering the checksum.

This method is used by Kazaa. The weakness of UUHash is exploited by anti-p2p agencies to corrupt downloads.

==How it works==

The UUHash is a 160-bit string that is usually Base64-encoded for presentation. It is a concatenation of an MD5 hash and a CRC32 sum of selected chunks of the file.

The first 307,200 bytes (300 Kibibyte, one &quot;chunk size&quot;) of the file are MD5-hashed (less if file is shorter). The 32 bit little endian integer value &quot;smallhash&quot; is initialized to 0.

If the file is strictly larger than one chunk size, a series of chunks at file offsets of 2n MiB (n ≥ 0) and one chunk right at the end of the file are hashed using a CRC32 (polynomial 0xEDB88320 reversed, 0x04C11DB7 normal). The last chunk of the power-of-two series ends strictly &quot;more&quot; than one chunk size before the end of the file, i.e. there is always at least one unread byte between the last two chunks (if there are that many chunks). The end-of-file chunk may be shorter than one chunk size; it starts at or after one chunk size into the file. The CRC is initialized using &quot;smallhash&quot; and stored into &quot;smallhash&quot;.

So, for example:
:offset 0 MiB, 300 KiB hashed with MD5
:offset 1 MiB, 300 KiB hashed with CRC32
:offset 2 MiB, 300 KiB hashed...
:offset 4 MiB, 300 KiB hashed...
:offset 8 MiB, 300 KiB hashed...
:last 300 KiB of file hashed with CRC32

Finally, the bitwise complement of &quot;smallhash&quot; (still zero for files up to 300 KiB) is XORed together with the file size in bytes. The 160-bit UUHash is now the concatenation of the 128-bit MD5 hash and the final 32-bit &quot;smallhash&quot; value.

=== Test Vectors ===

Given below are hashes (base64 and hex) for strings of various lengths containing only codice_1 or codice_2 bytes, generated by sig2dat.

Note &quot;here&quot; that all strings that have a complete MD5 chunk have the same 128-bit prefix because their first chunks are the same (either 0x00 or 0xFF). For files that have the same number of chunks the CRC part differs only because of the included file length (all chunks are identical, or this weren&#x27;t the case). For files up to 300 KiB, the file length can be extracted from the last four bytes of the hash; &quot;smallhash&quot; is ~0.

==Sig2Dat==
The name UUHash derives from the sig2dat utility which creates URIs referencing files on Kazaa. These URIs are of the form:
 sig2dat://|File: surprise.mp3|Length:5845871Bytes|UUHash:=1LDYkHDl65OprVz37xN1VSo9b00=

Not considering the fact that this URI format is not RFC compliant, UUHash refers to the Base64-encoding of the hash and not the hash itself.

<doc id="496636" wikidata="Q882680" url="?curid=496636" title="List of kings of Cyrene">
<text>[[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] or [[Cyrenaica]] was a Greek colony on the North African coast, in what is now northeastern Libya, founded by Dorian settlers from Thera (modern Santorini) in the 7th century BC. Kings of Cyrene received a recurring posthumous hero cult like that of the Dorian kings of Sparta.

==Kings of Cyrene (Battiad dynasty), 632–440 BC==
*Battus I 630–600 BC
*Arcesilaus I 600–583 BC
*Battus II 583–560 BC
*Arcesilaus II 560–550 BC
*Learchus 550 BC (disputed)
*Battus III 550–530 BC
*Arcesilaus III 530–515 BC
*Battus IV 515–465 BC
*Arcesilaus IV 465–440 BC

In 440 BC, Cyrene became a republic, under Persian suzerainty (as had been the latter kings from Arcesilaus III). Cyrene was conquered by Alexander the Great in 331 BC and fell to the portion of Ptolemy I in the division of Alexander&#x27;s empire. In 276 BC it reasserted its independence.

==Kings of Cyrene, 276–246 BC==
*Magas 276–250 BC
*Berenice II (Queen) 258–246 BC, alongside a series of her co-rulers: Magas, Demetrius and a republican government
*Demetrius the Fair 250–249 BC
*&quot;Republican government&quot; 249–246 BC

In 249 BC Cyrene again became a republic, but was restored to Ptolemaic control in 246 BC by Ptolemy III who married to Berenice II, Queen of Cyrene. From 163 BC, Cyrene occasionally had its own rulers from the Ptolemaic dynasty.

==Kings of Cyrene, 163–30 BC==
*Ptolemy VIII Physcon 163–116 BC
*Ptolemy Apion 116–96 BC
*&quot;Roman Republic&quot; 96–37 BC (officially annexed as a province in 74 BC)
*&quot;Ptolemaic Kingdom&quot; 37–34 BC
*Cleopatra Selene II (Queen) 34–30 BC
In 96 BC, the city became part of the Roman Republic, but it was restored to the Ptolemies by Mark Antony in 37 BC. In 34 BC Cleopatra VII and Antony&#x27;s daughter, Cleopatra Selene II, was made Queen of Cyrene, but the city returned to Rome following Augustus&#x27; conquest of Egypt in 30 BC.

<text>The Barbarian Invasions () is a 2003 Canadian-French sex comedy-drama film written and directed by Denys Arcand and starring Rémy Girard, Stéphane Rousseau and Marie-Josée Croze. The film is a sequel to Arcand&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot;, continuing the story of the character Rémy, a womanizing history professor now terminally ill with cancer.

The sequel was a result of Arcand&#x27;s longtime desire to make a film about a character close to death, also incorporating a response to the September 11 attacks of 2001. It was produced by companies from both Canada and France, and shot mainly in Montreal, also employing a former hospital and property near Lake Memphremagog.

The film received a positive response from critics and became one of Arcand&#x27;s biggest financial successes. It was the first Canadian film to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, at the 76th Academy Awards in 2004. It won awards at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, six Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, and three César Awards, including Best Film. &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; was followed by the thematically related &quot;Days of Darkness&quot; in 2007 and &quot;The Fall of the American Empire&quot; in 2018.

==Plot==
Seventeen years after the events of &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot;, Sébastien is enjoying a successful career in quantitative finance in London when he receives a call from his mother, Louise, that his father and Louise&#x27;s ex-husband Rémy is terminally ill with cancer. Sébastien is not enthused about seeing Rémy, whom he blames for breaking up the family with his many adulteries. Rémy and his friends of the older generation are still largely social-democrats and proponents of Quebec nationalism, positions seeming somewhat anachronistic long after the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Rémy does not like Sébastien&#x27;s career, lack of reading or fondness for video games.

The father and son travel to the U.S. state of Vermont to briefly receive medical care before returning to the overcrowded and disorganized Quebec hospital. Sébastien attempts to bribe hospital administration for better care, and calls Rémy&#x27;s old friends about a possible visit. Upon hearing heroin is &quot;800%&quot; more effective than morphine, he tracks some down for Rémy from a drug addict, Nathalie.

Meanwhile, Rémy is reunited with his friends, including Pierre, Dominique, Claude and Diane, Nathalie&#x27;s mother, and they share a conversation on their old sex drive and the gradual decline of their vitality. Diane is concerned for Nathalie, while Rémy, a history professor, lectures the hospital chaplain Constance on the relative peace of the 20th century compared to past centuries. At the same time, another scholar describes the September 11 attacks as historically small except as a possible beginning of modern barbarian invasions. After Rémy and his friends retreat to the countryside, they speak of their devotion to constantly evolving -isms. Rémy dies in the company of his friends and Sébastien, after a heroin injection from Nathalie, whom Rémy calls his guardian angel.

===Development===

Denys Arcand, who wrote and directed the successful French Canadian film &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; (1986), developed the idea of returning to the characters years later due to a fascination with death and an idea of having a character who is expecting to die. Part of his interest in the subject matter related to both of his parents dying of cancer. He had tried to write screenplays about non-&quot;Decline&quot; characters going to die for 20 years prior to &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;, originally pitching the idea to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation but having difficulty with the subject matter being overly sentimental. He finally decided to try the story with characters from &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; because of his fondness for its cast members. There are also characters from Arcand&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; in the film.

The September 11 attacks of 2001 occurred when Arcand was nearly finished his screenplay, and gave new impetus to Arcand&#x27;s ideas of &quot;the decline of the American Empire.&quot; Arcand believed the attack represented the first of what would be many foreign attacks on the U.S. Arcand also referred to himself as &quot;post-isms&quot;, and incorporated this discussion into the film.

Another statement he tried to make with his film was that heroin could be legalized for terminally ill patients in Canada, claiming it already is in England. Author Susan C. Boyd wrote that, despite what the film portrays, heroin has been legal in Canadian palliative care since 1984. To research how his character would find heroin, Arcand contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and met with them in an interrogation room, resembling the one in the final film. He claimed the RCMP gave him the cellphone number of a Montreal detective, and when he called it, he heard shouting from a police raid on the Hells Angels, which resulted in the arrest of Maurice Boucher.

The film was produced by both Canadian and French companies, including Telefilm Canada, Société Radio-Canada and Canal+. The budget was $6 million.

===Casting===

The cast members from the previous film, including Dorothee Berryman, Louise Portal, Dominique Michel, Pierre Curzi and Yves Jacques, were easy to secure for the sequel. New to the cast was Marie-Josée Croze, who was selected by Arcand after starring in the Canadian films &quot;Maelstrom&quot; (2000) and &quot;Ararat&quot; (2002). She found Arcand allowed her freedom in how she interpreted her role. In &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot;, Croze&#x27;s character Nathalie is played by child actress Ariane Frédérique.

Stéphane Rousseau, better known in Quebec as a stand-up comedian than an actor, was cast as Sébastien, after Dominique Michel urged Arcand to allow Rousseau to audition. Arcand explained he felt Rousseau had the &quot;authority&quot; the other actors who auditioned did not, though Rousseau was surprised to get the part as he felt his character was colder and more of an intellectual than he was. Rousseau&#x27;s mother had died of cancer when he was a child, and he had fought with his father, later incorporating that experience into his performance.

===Filming===
The film was shot over 50 days, beginning in September 2002 and finishing in November. The bulk of the film was shot in Montreal, with some scenes filmed in London. Footage from the World Trade Center attack shot by a Quebec architect and acquired by Radio-Canada was also used.

For the hospital scenes, the cast and crew employed Lachine General Hospital, an unused former hospital in Lachine, Quebec. Cinematographer Guy Dufaux found these scenes difficult to make interesting and realistic at the same time, and decided on more lighting for later scenes when the film&#x27;s mood brightens, while using fluorescent fixtures and reflecting the former hospital&#x27;s green painting to shoot the early scenes. As with the first film, scenes were filmed near Lake Memphremagog. Most of the film was shot using a Steadicam.

==Release==
News that Arcand was working on a sequel to his 1986 film was received with a skeptical and negative response from critics. The film was screened at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival in May, where it received a 22-minute standing ovation, with distribution to 30 countries assured by the time Arcand received his Best Screenplay award. It was afterwards selected to open the gala at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival in September, and also opened the Vancouver International Film Festival that month. The film began playing in Quebec theatres in May and ran for months, with its Canadian distributor being Alliance Films. It opened across Canada on 21 November.

After Cannes, rights were sold to Miramax for distribution of the film in the United States. It opened in New York and Los Angeles on 21 November. In France, the film was available on 450 screens at one time, the most for a Quebec film ever.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film&#x27;s box office performance at Quebec theatres between its opening in May 2003 and the fall was considered good. By December, its initial release across Canada made $5.9 million.

In France, it grossed the equivalent of US$8 million. According to &quot;Box Office Mojo&quot;, the film finished its run on 3 June 2004 after grossing $8,544,975 in North America and $18,379,681 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $26,924,656. It was one of Arcand&#x27;s biggest box office successes.

===Critical reception===

&quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; has received positive reviews from numerous critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an 81% approval rating based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. Metacritic reports that the film has an average score of 70 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In Canada, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; critic Brian D. Johnson called it not only satirical but &quot;a moving elegy to a generation that defined modern Quebec and has seen its passions rendered obsolete&quot;. Liam Lacey wrote in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that the film is &quot;upbeat and wryly positive, or at least as much as you could expect from a film that condemns the Quebec hospital system and features a death by cancer as its central theme&quot;. The film drew general attention for its criticism of Quebec&#x27;s health care system. Peter Howell wrote in &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; that &quot;It&#x27;s the depth of emotions Arcand summons for his characters, and the way this superb ensemble cast bring them so vividly to life, that make &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; a film not just to see, but to welcome home&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave the movie four stars and called it &quot;a movie with brains, indignation, irony and idealism&quot;. A.O Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;what makes &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; much more than a facile exercise in generational conflict is that Denys Arcand, who wrote and directed it, has a sense of history that is as acute as it is playful&quot;, adding &quot;The rapprochement between Remy and Sebastien is beautiful to watch&quot; and Marie-Josée Croze&#x27;s &quot;spooky, melancholy intensity darkens the mood of buoyant sentimentality&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman gave the film a B−, noting Rémy&#x27;s hedonism. David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; gave credit to Stéphane Rousseau for &quot;a fascinatingly minimal performance&quot;. Jonathan Romney of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote &quot;The film has its pros and cons, but you can&#x27;t fault it for ambition: it not only muses on life and death, but also undertakes fairly comprehensive philosophical soundings of the way the world is today&quot;. Romney added Croze &quot;has simply the most nuanced presence here: thoughtful, introspective, with a reassuring warmth and lack of cartoonishness&quot;. Peter Bradshaw, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, disdained the movie, calling it &quot;grotesquely overpraised&quot;, &quot;shot through with middlebrow sophistication, boorish cynicism, unfunny satire, a dash of fatuous anti-Americanism and unthinkingly reactionary sexual politics&quot;. English Professor Peter Brunette wrote &quot;its analysis of this state of affairs is all too often annoyingly rhetorical and, finally, altogether too facile&quot;.

In 2004, the Toronto International Film Festival ranked the film tenth in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. David Lawrence Pike criticized the use of the World Trade Center footage as exploitative, but said despite &quot;the crudeness and vulgarity&quot;, the film had a &quot;particular brilliance&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot; is considered historically significant as the first Canadian film to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Canadian historian George Melnyk interpreted it as a sign that &quot;Canadian cinema has come of global age&quot;, also pointing to &quot;&quot; (2001) winning the Camera d&#x27;Or at Cannes.

Marie-Josée Croze&#x27;s honour for Best Actress at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival was considered unlikely. She was not present to accept the award. The film&#x27;s victory at France&#x27;s national César Awards was also considered a surprise, since it is mainly a Quebec film. It received the most nominations at the 24th Genie Awards.

==Legacy==
In 2007, Arcand&#x27;s film &quot;Days of Darkness&quot; was released. While considered part of a loose trilogy following &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; and &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;, Arcand acknowledged in a 2007 interview &quot;Days of Darkness&quot; had more similarities to his less successful 2000 film &quot;Stardom&quot;. Johanne-Marie Tremblay reprised her role as Constance from &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; and &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;. In 2018, Arcand&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the American Empire&quot; followed similar themes.

<text>Interstate 435 (I-435) is an Interstate Highway beltway that encircles much of the Kansas City metropolitan area within the states of Kansas and Missouri in the United States.

==Route description==
I-435, a loop route of I-35, is long and intersects with nearly every other Interstate Highway in the Kansas City area (except for I-635 and I-670). An additional near Kansas City International Airport is signed along with I-29 and U.S. Route 71 (US 71), making I-435 the second-longest complete beltway numbered as a single Interstate Highway in the US and seventh longest in the world after I-275 in Cincinnati, Ohio, at ; Beltway 8 in Houston, Texas, at ; Bundesautobahn 10 in Berlin at ; and M25 motorway in London at ; as well as 7th and 8th ring roads in Beijing. The majority——of I-435 is within the state of Missouri, and most of that roadway lies within the city limits of Kansas City. The first/last exit is at I-435&#x27;s parent route, I-35, in Lenexa, Kansas. Going clockwise around Kansas City, the next interchange is exit 1A for Lackman Road. The milepost numbers do not start over when I-435 crosses the state line, but where it shares the same roadway as I-29, the latter&#x27;s milepost (and therefore exit) numbering takes precedence.

The section of I-435 from mile marker 63.4 to mile marker 54.2 is designated as the Lamar Hunt Memorial Highway in honor of Lamar Hunt, the founder of the Kansas City Chiefs. This section of the highway passes near Arrowhead Stadium, the Chiefs&#x27; home stadium.

==History==
I-435 in Kansas City was built piece by piece starting in the mid-1960s and not finished until 1987.

In 1965, the first segment of I-435 was built and opened between I-35 and US 69 (which, at that time, was signed with Metcalf Avenue) near Overland Park, Kansas. A second segment was opened the same year between I-70 and US 50 in eastern Kansas City, Missouri, but the two were not connected. The eastern segment of I-435 was extended south to Gregory Boulevard and north past 22nd Street/Route 78 by 1968. By 1969, I-435 was fully built between these two segments, through southern and eastern Kansas City. The freeway was extended from 22nd Street/Route 78 to US 24 two years later. In 1973, I-435 was extended north from the former terminus of US 24 across the Missouri River to I-35 in Claycomo. It now extended halfway around the city. In 1983, a small segment was opened on the outskirts of Kansas City north between US 169 and Route 291 near Kansas City International Airport (KCI). Later, this small segment was connected with the rest of the freeway. A segment was built heading almost due north from I-35 in Claycomo to Route 291/Cookingham Drive at North Reinking Road, curving due west from there to US 169. In this year, the southwest end was also extended to K-10. In 1987, the freeway was opened all the way around the city. The northwest end was signed on I-29 for northwest, then exited near Platte City and bore south on the westside of KCI. It crossed several small highways before crossing the Missouri River into Wyandotte County, Kansas. It continued generally south or southwest, crossed several state highways and I-70, then the Kaw River, before connecting with the former southwest end at K-10.

<doc id="496649" wikidata="Q115687930" url="?curid=496649" title="List of kings of Numidia">
<text>Numidia was an ancient Berber kingdom located in the region of North Africa that today comprises Algeria and parts of today Tunisia, Libya and Morocco. The kingdom existed from the 3rd to the 1st century BC. Rome established it as a client kingdom after the Second Punic War and annexed it, first in 46 BC and again in 25 BC after a brief period of restored independence under King Juba II (30 BC–25 BC).

==List of kings==
=== Kings of the Massylii (Eastern Numidia) ===
The last ruler of the Massylii conquered the Masaesyli and created the unified Numidian kingdom.
=== Kings of the Masaesyli (Western Numidia) ===
*Syphax (bef. 215–202)
*Vermina (202–???)
*Archobarzane (???–c. 157)

=== Kings of Numidia ===

The three sons of Massinissa originally shared the kingdom, dividing responsibility. Micipsa later tried the same thing with his three heirs, but the result was a civil war. The Roman Republic defeated Numidia during the Jugurthine War. Gauda thus succeeded to a reduced Numidian kingdom. He divided the kingdom geographically between his two sons, establishing two different lines of Numidian kings. They were briefly displaced by a certain Hiarbas, but Roman intervention restored them.
*Massinissa I (202–148)
*Micipsa (148–118), son of Massinissa
*Gulussa (148–145), son of Massinissa
*Mastanabal (148–14?), son of Massinissa
*Hiempsal I (118–117), son of Micipsa
*Adherbal (118–112), son of Micipsa
*Jugurtha (118–105), son of Mastanabal
*Gauda (105–88), son of Mastanabal
*Hiarbas (??–81)

====Eastern Numidia====
This was the main Numidian kingdom after 81.
*Hiempsal II (88–60), son of Gauda
*Juba I (60–46), son of Hiempsal II
&quot;Annexed to Rome as province Africa Nova (46–30)&quot;.
*Juba II (30–25), son of Juba I
&quot;Annexed to Rome as province Africa Proconsularis (25 BCE - 193 CE)&quot;.

====Western Numidia====
This was a much smaller chiefdom than Eastern Numidia

*Masteabar (88–81)
*Massinissa II (81–46)
*Sittius (46–44), a Roman mercenary leader
*Arabio (44–40)
&quot;Annexed to Rome as part of province Africa Nova (40–30)&quot;.
*Juba II (30–25), son of Juba I
&quot;Annexed to the Kingdom of Mauretania (25 BCE - 40 CE)&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Mollwitz was fought by Prussia and Austria on 10 April 1741, during the First Silesian War (in the early stages of the War of the Austrian Succession). It was the first battle of the new Prussian King Frederick II, in which both sides made numerous military blunders. Frederick fled the battlefield, but the Prussian Army managed to attain victory. This battle cemented Frederick&#x27;s authority over the newly conquered territory of Silesia and gave him valuable military experience.

== Background ==

The War of the Austrian Succession was sparked by the death of Charles VI in 1740 and the succession of his daughter Maria Theresa. The Habsburg monarchy was originally subject to Salic law, which excluded women from inheriting it; the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction set this aside, allowing Maria Theresa to succeed her father.

That became a European issue because the Habsburg monarchy was the most powerful element in the Holy Roman Empire, a loose federation of mostly-German states. Its position was threatened by the growing size and power of Bavaria, Prussia, and Saxony, as well as Habsburg expansion into lands held by the Ottoman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire was headed by the Holy Roman Emperor, which was, in theory, an elected post though it had been held by a Habsburg since 1437. France, Prussia and Saxony now challenged Austrian dominance by nominating Charles of Bavaria as Emperor.

In December 1740, Frederick II seized the opportunity to invade Silesia and begin the First Silesian War. With a population of over one million, the Silesian mining, weaving and dyeing industries produced 10% of total Imperial income. Under Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin, the Prussians quickly over-ran most of the province and settled into winter quarters but failed to capture the southern fortresses of Glogau, Breslau, and Brieg. Maria Theresa sent an army of about 20,000 men led by Wilhelm Reinhard von Neipperg to take back the province and assert herself as a strong monarch.

== Austrian army&#x27;s advance north ==
Neipperg&#x27;s army caught Frederick II completely off guard as he lingered in the province, and surged northwards past Frederick and his army to relieve the city of Neisse, which was being besieged by a small Prussian force and had not yet fallen. Both Neipperg and Frederick rushed northwards in parallel columns, in a race to reach the city first. In atrocious weather, Neipperg reached Neisse first and set up camp there. Frederick II and his entire army were now caught behind enemy lines with a large Austrian force lying between him and the rest of his kingdom and his supply and communication lines cut off. Both sides knew that battle was now inevitable.

== Prussian preparations ==
Captured Austrian soldiers told Frederick the exact position of Neipperg&#x27;s forces at Mollwitz, and the morning fog and snow allowed Frederick&#x27;s army to advance undetected to within 2000 paces of Neipperg&#x27;s camp. Most commanders would then have given the order to charge the camp and rout the Austrian army, but since Frederick had never fought a campaign or a battle before, he instead decided to deploy his army in a battle line. There was very heavy snow on the ground which caused snow-blindness, and Frederick miscalculated the distance to the river on his right. He deployed several of his units behind a bend in the river where they could take no part in the battle, and several more units were deployed perpendicular to his two battle lines on the right flank. It is said that Schwerin commented early on that Frederick miscalculated the distance, but he was ignored.

== Austrian preparations ==
Neipperg was unprepared for battle when he discovered Frederick&#x27;s entire army was approaching. Not only were Austrian troops still in bivouac and cooking food, but they were scattered across three villages with their front facing away from the Prussian advance. Had the Prussians attacked at this time, they would have encountered only disorganized resistance. Because of the two hour delay caused by Frederick dressing his battle lines, the Austrian army had the opportunity to concentrate its forces and form a battle line by the time the forces engaged one another just before 2 pm.

== Battle ==

At the beginning of the battle, the Prussians had the larger army. They also had three times the field guns than the Austrians had; however, the Austrian cavalry outnumbered the Prussian cavalry two to one. The Prussian forces advanced toward the Austrians in two lines while the Prussian artillery began bombarding the Austrian line. Six regiments of Austrian cavalry on the extreme left flank of the Austrian line, numbering 4,500 to 5,000 men and horses, were goaded by the Prussian bombardment to charge the Prussian right flank without orders from Neipperg. The charge shattered the Prussian cavalry, who received the attack while at a full halt. Frederick was with the Prussian cavalry and was caught up in its rout. This left the Prussian flank open to attack, and the Austrian cavalry then turned on the unprotected infantry. Schwerin, the Prussian military commander under Frederick, now advised the king to leave the battlefield because it looked as though the Prussian army was about to be defeated; Frederick heeded this warning. Abandoning the field, he was nearly caught and almost shot. Frederick&#x27;s absence allowed Schwerin, a veteran general, to take command of the troops himself.
At this point of the battle, the scene was chaotic. Having scattered the Prussian cavalry, the Austrian cavalry continued its attack on the Prussian infantry. They charged the infantry repeatedly. The firing of Prussian soldiers from the second line who were trying to stop the Austrians was also killing Prussian soldiers in the first line. When asked whether the Prussians would retreat, Schwerin answered &quot;Over enemy bodies&quot;. The Prussian infantry, which had been rigorously drilled and trained under Frederick William I, held firm and continued firing rapid volleys into the Austrian cavalry, causing it tremendous losses and killing its commander, General Römer.

After the repulse of the Austrian cavalry, Schwerin reformed the infantry and ordered infantry units that were short on ammunition to strip the dead of theirs. He then ordered the right flank of the Prussian infantry to advance toward the Austrian infantry line, with the left flank receiving the order to advance a few minutes later. This resulted in an oblique order attack on the Austrian infantry line with the right flank of the Prussians overlapping the left flank of the Austrians. In addition, the Prussian infantry&#x27;s use of the recently invented iron ramrod, allowed them to fire 4–5 shots a minute with their flintlock muskets, which was three times more rapid than any other European army at the time. This combination of discipline and firepower quickly overwhelmed the Austrian infantry, which consisted of a large number of raw recruits lacking the training of the Prussian infantry. Soon, the Austrian line collapsed from left to right, and the Austrian army was routed from the field.

== Aftermath ==

In the end, the Prussians won a close victory against a numerically inferior enemy due to the leadership of Field Marshal Schwerin and the superior training of the Prussian infantry. After the battle, the Austrian army was not pursued and remained intact. Neipperg retreated to Neisse, remaining in Silesia to await reinforcements. Frederick returned to his army the morning after the battle, restored his lines of communication, and subsequently brought the siege of Brieg to a successful conclusion.

After the battle Frederick censured himself for his mistakes and learned from them, writing later that Mollwitz educated him and his army. The battle showed that Frederick could depend on the superior training of the Prussian infantry in a battle, which had proven itself able to withstand the charge of Austrian cavalry. Realizing that the cavalry would have to be reformed to be able to hold its own against the excellently-trained Austrian cavalry, he soon instituted a training program to discipline the Prussian cavalry in coordinated action and precision that would increase its effectiveness in both reconnaissance and battle. Mollwitz also illustrated the effectiveness of the oblique order, a tactic Frederick would use in most of his later major battles.

In spite of the fact that the battle had been a near disaster for Frederick and was not won through his direct command, the victory raised his prestige in Europe by demonstrating that Frederick was capable of challenging the Habsburgs and emerging victorious. The Prussian victory also made it clear to Maria Theresa that she would not be able to reassert her control of Silesia easily and that Prussia was a military power that would have to be more carefully reckoned with. The defeat of Maria Theresa&#x27;s army at Mollwitz encouraged other rulers to deny the Pragmatic Sanction and to claim much of the Habsburg territories amongst themselves. Within a few months, France, Spain, Bavaria, Saxony, Savoy and Prussia became allies in a loose coalition known as the League of Nymphenburg, widening the conflict into a larger European affair that would become known as the War of the Austrian Succession.

The series was released in 1992 by Jump Video. It roughly covers most of the material found in the first three volumes of the manga. In 2018 a live-action television drama called &quot;Den&#x27;ei Shōjo ~Video Girl Ai 2018~&quot; ran on TV Tokyo. Another series, &quot;Den&#x27;ei Shōjo ~Video Girl Mai 2019~&quot;, was released the following year.

==Plot==
The story starts when Yota Moteuchi finds out that the girl he likes, Moemi Hayakawa, is in love with his best friend, Takashi Niimai. Disappointed by this fact, he decides to rent a video from a mysterious video store that appears in front of him on his way home. The video store is called &quot;Gokuraku&quot; (&#x27;Paradise&#x27;). The unique thing about this video store was that the videos in the store contained &quot;video girls,&quot; girls who come to life and out of the user&#x27;s television when the videotape is played to cheer the renter up. Not knowing about the video girls, Yota chooses to rent the video &#x27;I&#x27;ll Cheer You Up!&#x27;, starring Ai Amano. Ai comes to life with the purpose to brighten up Yota&#x27;s life and encourage him to pursue his love.

However, Yota plays the video on a broken video recorder, which causes Ai to come out &quot;broken&quot;; among other effects, she has the ability to feel emotions. This additional feature of Ai causes her to eventually fall in love with Yota; a feeling which, after giving up on Moemi, Yota begins to return. However, a mysterious man related to Gokuraku, known as Rolex, enters the story and tries to recall Ai as she is faulty, and the fact that Ai&#x27;s tape is nearing the end of its playing time makes matters even worse.

From this point on, the story changes focus slightly and concentrates on Yota and Ai attempting to overcome the difficulties presented by Gokuraku. Various other complications come into the story; for example, Yota&#x27;s continuing love for Moemi and his relationship with a new character, Nobuko Nizaki. Initially, Ai spends some of her time teasing Yota mercilessly in various sexual manners, i.e., pretending to initiate intercourse or joining Yota &quot;innocently&quot; in the bath &quot;to help him wash.&quot; Yota&#x27;s resulting embarrassment and attempt to extricate himself from the situation results, as always, in some slapstick humor and more resulting sexual tension.

==Characters==
=== Ai Amano ===
 She is portrayed by Kaori Sakagami in the 1991 film, and Nanase Nishino in the 2018 TV drama. Beautiful, full of boundless energy. Hard to say what she is really like, versus what she was intended to be. Video girls are generally supposed to be comforting, nubile, excellent cooks and socially graceful, but the malfunction of Yota&#x27;s VCR has made her tomboyish, at times rude, prone to violence, a terrible cook (actually, she learns to cook all by herself), but full of heart and able to feel human emotion. Her chest endowment has also shrunk considerably due to said VCR malfunction.

=== Yota Moteuchi ===
 He is portrayed by Ken Osawa (1991 film) and Shigeyuki Totsugi (2018 TV drama). Yota is the stereotypical loser, unable to declare his feelings to his unrequited love, Moemi, socially awkward, with a tendency to get nervous and clumsy around women. However, he is known to be also very caring, kind, and helpful to those he is close to.

=== Moemi Hayakawa ===
 She is portrayed by Hiromi Hamaguchi in the 1991 film. An attractive girl, though almost hopelessly moon-eyed over Takashi, who is too popular to really appreciate Moemi&#x27;s affectations.

=== Takashi Niimai ===
 He is portrayed by Naoki Hosaka in the 1991 film. The typical &quot;tall, dark and handsome&quot; popular guy. He is one of Yota&#x27;s best friends, and rejects Moemi&#x27;s advances because he knows Yota&#x27;s feelings for her.

=== Nobuko Nizaki ===
 is a girl, one year behind Yota, who developed a crush on him in art class two years earlier and now, with Moemi and Ai temporarily sidelined, can pursue romantic ties with Yota. She first appears midway through volume 3 and only appears in the manga.

=== Natsumi Yamaguchi ===
 is a girl, an orphan and a runaway, who had played with Yota in kindergarten. Her family then moved away. Her theme is misfortune. Her attribute is a hand extended to help one up. She first appears in volume 6 and only appears in the manga. She seems to have a weak heart. Later on in the series she dies in the hospital, and becomes Ai&#x27;s role model in love.

===Len story characters===
==== Len Momono ====
 is the star of &quot;Let&#x27;s Fall in Love&quot;. A new and untested video girl. She was created by the nameless &quot;Old Man&quot; who once worked in the &quot;Gokuraku&quot; store. Unlike Ai and the original video girls, she is allowed to feel emotions of her own.

==== Hiromu Taguchi and Toshiki Karukawa ====
Hiromu and Toshiki are the boys who rent the tape. Hiromu is the center character of this new story arc, and is pretty much as shy as Yota used to be. He has a keen interest in Ayumi, but there are some problems in their relationship because of his shyness and because of the bad reputation she has. Later, they engage, but Hiromu becomes too happy to pay attention to Ayumi, and they break up temporarily until he can &quot;find her again&quot; in his memories. Toshiki, on the other hand, is more emotionally expressive and prone to teenage-typical reactions, like spying on Len (which makes her angry).

==== Ayumi Shirakawa ====
 is the girl Hiromu wants to love. However, their relationship is made difficult because of a rumor spread out by her ex-boyfriend, which gave her a bad reputation in her school and beyond (Hiromu and Ayumi attend different schools). Len then devised a plan to re-approach them, just to make Ayumi see who she was dealing with all along. She breaks up with her ex-boyfriend for good and starts dating Hiromu.

==== Yota Moteuchi ====
Eight years older than he was at the end of &quot;Video Girl Ai&quot;, Yota now teaches at an art school in the afternoon, which Hiromu and Ayumi attend. He is Hiromu&#x27;s mentor and they talk often about Len. Yota tells Ayumi that Len went through the same experiences that she is going through. He does mention at one point in the series that Ai is doing well.

==Media==
===Manga===
&quot;Video Girl Ai&quot; is written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura. The manga was serialized in the &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from December 4, 1989, to April 20, 1992. It was followed by &quot;Video Girl Len&quot;, which was serialized from April 27 to July 20, 1992. Shueisha compiled the 131 individual chapters into fifteen &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes published between July 1990 and March 1993. Shueisha re-published the series into nine &quot;bunkoban&quot; volumes between January and May 2003.

In North America, Viz Media announced the license of the manga in August 1998. It was first published in the anthology &quot;Animerica Extra&quot; by Viz until the cancelation of the magazine in December 2004. The manga was originally released in a left to right edition; this version was compiled into seven volumes published between January 2000 and January 2004. The complete series was released in a second edition of all fifteen volumes in the original right to left orientation between May 2004 and April 2006.

<doc id="496662" wikidata="Q574824" url="?curid=496662" title="List of rulers of Bithynia">
<text>This is a list of kings of [[Kingdom of Bithynia|Bithynia]], an ancient kingdom in northwestern Anatolia.

Before Zipoetes I of Bithynia assumed the Greek title of &quot;Basileus&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) in 297 BCE, the positions of him and his predecessors are variously described as &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;chieftain&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;, and &quot;king&quot;. One of the primary sources for the monarchs of Bithynia is &quot;About Hericlea&quot; () of Memnon of Heraclea.
== List ==
* Doedalsus (). Memnon of Heraclea wrote about him: &quot;Astacus] achieved great glory and strength, when Dudalsos had the dominion of the Bithynians.&quot; (). Andrew Smith (2004) translated this as &quot;when Doedalsus was the ruler of the Bithynians.&quot; The only other mention of this person is found in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; 12.4.2, where his name is spelt as ̇Δοιδαλσοῦ, but he is not identified with the Bithynians, only with the city of Astacus. Slavova (2015) called him a &quot;Bithynian king&quot;. According to Olmstead (2022), he was &quot;the first-known semi-independent king of Bithynia&quot;.
* Boteiras d. 376 BCE. He is mentioned only by Memnon as a successor of Dudalsos.
* Bas 376–326 BCE. Memnon wrote: &quot;The life of this [Bas] became 71 years, of which he reigned as king 50.&quot; (. Smith (2004) translated this passage as: &quot;He lived for 71 years, and was king for 50 years.&quot;
* Zipoetes I 326–278 BCE. Memnon of Heraclea called him &quot;Zipoites the eparch of the Bithynians&quot; (). Andrew Smith (2004) translated this as &quot;Zipoetes, the ruler of the Bithynians&quot;. According to Williams (1990), Zipoetes was a &quot;chieftain&quot; before he assumed the Greek title of &quot;basileus&quot; (&quot;king&quot;) in 297 BCE. Memnon of Heraclea appeared not to make such a distinction when he described Zipoetes&#x27; entire reign: &quot;The life of this one [Zipoites] was 76 years, and he ruled the dominion 48.&quot; (). Smith (2004) translated the passage as &quot;Zipoetes lived for 76 years and ruled the kingdom for 48 years.&quot; Slavova (2015) called him a &quot;Bithynian king&quot;.
* Zipoetes II 278–276 BC
* Nicomedes I 278–255 BC. Memnon described him as &quot;...the Bithynians, whose &quot;basileus&quot; Nicomedes...&quot; () and &quot;the &quot;basileus&quot; of Bithynia Nicomedes&quot; (); Smith (2004) rendered &quot;basileus&quot; as &quot;king&quot;.
* Etazeta (regent) 255–254 BC
* Ziaelas 254–228 BC
* Prusias I Cholus 228–182 BC
* Prusias II Cynegus 182–149 BC
* Nicomedes II Epiphanes 149–127 BC
* Nicomedes III Euergetes 127–94 BC
* Nicomedes IV Philopator 94–74 BC
* Socrates Chrestus who ruled briefly in about 90 BC

The coinage of these kings shows their regal portraits, which tend to be engraved in an extremely accomplished Hellenistic style.

<doc id="496664" wikidata="Q839061" url="?curid=496664" title="Interstate 535">
<text>Interstate 535 (I-535) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway spur route of I-35 in the US states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. It is paired with U.S. Highway 53 (US 53) along its entire route. The Interstate was part of the original 1956 Interstate Highway System and was completed in 1971. Since then, weight limits have been added to the Blatnik Bridge that carries the highway over Saint Louis Bay between Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota.

==Route description==
I-535 begins in the city of Superior, Wisconsin, at the junction of US 53 and State Trunk Highway 35 (WIS 35) and continues northwest across the Blatnik Bridge over the Saint Louis Bay of Lake Superior. The freeway crosses from Wisconsin into Minnesota on the bridge and then meets an interchange for Garfield Avenue and the Port Terminal in the city of Duluth. I-535 ends at the junction of US 53 and I-35, known locally as the &quot;Can of Worms&quot; interchange, which features a pair of left exits from I-35, a stoplight, and lane drops over the I-35 bridge.

In 2007, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) surveys measured a traffic along their segment of I-535 at 21,800–29,500 vehicles daily, on average. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) measured 29,500 vehicles daily in their 2009 survey. As an Interstate Highway, I-535 is a part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. I-535 is part of the Falls-to-Falls Corridor, a federally recognized trade corridor spanning from Eau Claire–Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to International Falls, Minnesota–Fort Frances, Ontario.

==History==
I-535 was authorized in 1957 as part of the original Interstate Highway System. The Blatnik Bridge was opened in 1961, and the ramps to I-35 were completed in 1971. I-535 and the Blatnik Bridge replaced a swinging toll bridge at generally the same location. That bridge existed from 1897 to 1962 and carried US 53 from Connor&#x27;s Point in Superior to Garfield Avenue in Duluth.

In November 2011, both MnDOT and WisDOT installed new signs to remind drivers that trucks over gross vehicle weight cannot use the Blatnik Bridge; these vehicles will be rerouted to the nearby Bong Bridge. According to the press release, permitted, overweight vehicles have been restricted from using the Blatnik Bridge since early 2008 when inspections showed that corrosion and time were starting to affect the structure. Transportation officials say that the bridge is aging, and restriction of overweight vehicles will help to extend the life of the bridge. Drivers who disregard the posted weight limits will be ticketed.

<doc id="496667" wikidata="Q190022" url="?curid=496667" title="Auxin">
<text>Auxins ( ) are a class of plant hormones (or plant-growth regulators) with some morphogen-like characteristics. Auxins play a cardinal role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in plant life cycles and are essential for plant body development. The Dutch biologist Frits Warmolt Went first described auxins and their role in plant growth in the 1920s.
Kenneth V. Thimann became the first to isolate one of these phytohormones and to determine its chemical structure as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, &quot;Phytohormones&quot;, in 1937.

==Overview==
Auxins were the first of the major plant hormones to be discovered. They derive their name from the Greek word ( – &#x27;to grow/increase&#x27;). Auxin is present in all parts of a plant, although in very different concentrations. The concentration in each position is crucial developmental information, so it is subject to tight regulation through both metabolism and transport. The result is the auxin creates &quot;patterns&quot; of auxin concentration maxima and minima in the plant body, which in turn guide further development of respective cells, and ultimately of the plant as a whole.

The (dynamic and environment responsive) pattern of auxin distribution within the plant is a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs (such as leaves or flowers). It is achieved through very complex and well-coordinated active transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body—by the so-called polar auxin transport. Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a nervous system. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of auxin to cytokinin in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.

On the molecular level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group. The most important member of the auxin family is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its equilibrium is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible conjugation to degradation of its molecules, always according to the requirements of the situation. Auxin can act in a heat sensitive manner in many situations, which will in turn effect a plant&#x27;s phenotypic development.

* Five naturally occurring (endogenous) auxins in plants include indole-3-acetic acid, 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, indole-3-butyric acid, and indole-3-propionic acid. However, most of the knowledge described so far in auxin biology and as described in the sections which follow, apply basically to IAA; the other three endogenous auxins seems to have marginal importance for intact plants in natural environments. Alongside endogenous auxins, scientists and manufacturers have developed many synthetic compounds with auxinic activity.
* Synthetic auxins fall into four classes: 
**dicamba
**quinolinecarboxylic acids, which includes quinclorac
**derivatives of pyridinecarboxylic acids, which includes picloram, triclopyr, clopyralid
**phenoxyacetic acid, phenoxypropionic acid, and phenoxybutyric acid, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid derivatives 2,4-D, 2,4-DP 2,4-DB 2,4,5-T MCPA MCPB, mecoprop

Some synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), are sold as herbicides. Broad-leaf plants (dicots), such as dandelions, are much more susceptible to auxins than narrow-leaf plants (monocots) such as grasses and cereal crops, making these synthetic auxins valuable as herbicides. 

==Discovery==

===Charles Darwin===
In 1881, Charles Darwin and his son Francis performed experiments on coleoptiles, the sheaths enclosing young leaves in germinating grass seedlings. The experiment exposed the coleoptile to light from a unidirectional source, and observed that they bend towards the light. By covering various parts of the coleoptiles with a light-impermeable opaque cap, the Darwins discovered that light is detected by the coleoptile tip, but that bending occurs in the hypocotyl. However the seedlings showed no signs of development towards light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap, or if the tip was removed. The Darwins concluded that the tip of the coleoptile was responsible for sensing light, and proposed that a messenger is transmitted in a downward direction from the tip of the coleoptile, causing it to bend.

===Peter Boysen Jensen===
In 1910, Danish scientist Peter Boysen Jensen demonstrated that the phototropic stimulus in the oat coleoptile could propagate through an incision. These experiments were extended and published in greater detail in 1911 and 1913. He found that the tip could be cut off and put back on, and that a subsequent one-sided illumination was still able to produce a positive phototropic curvature in the basal part of the coleoptile. He demonstrated that the transmission could take place through a thin layer of gelatin separating the unilaterally illuminated tip from the shaded stump. By inserting a piece of mica he could block transmission in the illuminated and non-illuminated side of the tip, respectively, which allowed him to show that the transmission took place in the shaded part of the tip. Thus, the longitudinal half of the coleoptile that exhibits the greater rate of elongation during the phototropic curvature, was the tissue to receive the growth stimulus.

In 1911, Boysen Jensen concluded from his experimental results that the transmission of the phototropic stimulus was not a physical effect (for example due to a change in pressure) but &quot;serait dû à une migration de substance ou d’ions&quot; (was caused by the transport of a substance or of ions). These results were fundamental for further work on the auxin theory of tropisms.

===Frits Went===
In 1928, the Dutch botanist Frits Warmolt Went showed that a chemical messenger diffuses from coleoptile tips. Went&#x27;s experiment identified how a growth promoting chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards the light. Went cut the tips of the coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centered on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.

When the growth-promoting chemical was distributed evenly the coleoptile grew straight. If the chemical was distributed unevenly, the coleoptile curved away from the side with the cube, as if growing towards the light, even though it was grown in the dark. Went later proposed that the messenger substance is a growth-promoting hormone, which he named auxin, that becomes asymmetrically distributed in the bending region. Went concluded that auxin is at a higher concentration on the shaded side, promoting cell elongation, which results in coleoptiles bending towards the light.

==Hormonal activity==
Auxins help 
development at all levels in plants, from the cellular level, through organs, and ultimately to the whole plant.

=== Molecular mechanisms ===
When a plant cell comes into contact with auxin, it causes dramatic changes in gene expression, with many genes up- or down-regulated. The precise mechanisms by which this occurs are still an area of active research, but there is now a general consensus on at least two auxin signalling pathways.

====Perception ====
The best-characterized auxin receptors are the TIR1/ AFB family of F-box proteins. F-box proteins target other proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin degradation pathway. When TIR1/ AFB proteins bind to auxin, the auxin molecule acts as a &#x27;molecular glue&#x27;, a term coined by Ning Zheng, that allows these proteins to then bind to their targets (see below). The atomic structure of the perception mechanism of auxin by TIR1 was determined by X-ray crystallography.

Another auxin-binding protein, ABP1 is now often regarded as an auxin receptor (at the apoplast), but it is generally considered to have a much more minor role than the TIR1/AFB signaling pathway, and much less is known about ABP1 signaling.

====Aux/IAA and ARF signalling modules ====

Auxin response factors (ARFs) are a large group of transcription factors that act in auxin signaling. In the absence of auxin, ARFs bind to a class of repressors known as Aux/IAAs. Aux/IAA suppress the ability of ARFs to enhance gene transcription. Additionally, the binding of Aux/IAA to ARFs brings Aux/IAA into contact with the promoters of auxin-regulated genes. When at these promoters, Aux/IAA repress the expression of these genes through recruiting other factors to make modifications to the DNA structure.

The binding of auxin to TIR1/AFBs allows them to bind to Aux/IAAs. When bound by TIR1/AFBs, Aux/IAAs are marked for degradation. The degradation of Aux/IAA frees ARF proteins, which are then able to activate or repress genes at whose promoters they are bound. 
The large number of Aux/IAA and ARF binding pairs possible, and their different distributions between cell types and across developmental age are thought to account for the astonishingly diverse responses that auxin produces.

In June 2018, it was demonstrated that plant tissues can respond to auxin in a TIR1-dependent manner extremely quickly (probably too quickly to be explained by changes in gene expression). This has led some scientists to suggest that there is an as yet unidentified TIR1-dependent auxin-signalling pathway that differs from the well-known transcriptional response.

=== On a cellular level ===
On the cellular level, auxin is essential for cell growth, affecting both cell division and cellular expansion. Auxin concentration level, together with other local factors, contributes to cell differentiation and specification of the cell fate.

Depending on the specific tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or iso-diametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs in the absence of cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, auxins and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.

===Organ patterns===
Growth and division of plant cells together result in the growth of tissue, and specific tissue growth contributes to the development of plant organs.

Growth of cells contributes to the plant&#x27;s size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources (phototropism), roots growing in response to gravity (gravitropism), and other tropisms originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells on the other side of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.

====Auxin transport and the uneven distribution of auxin====
To cause growth in the required domains, auxins must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways, but auxins are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, auxins have to be not only translocated toward those sites where they are needed but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from peaks of shoots to peaks of roots (from up to down).

For long distances, relocation occurs via the stream of fluid in phloem vessels, but, for short-distance transport, a unique system of coordinated polar transport directly from cell to cell is exploited. This short-distance, active transport exhibits some morphogenetic properties.

This process, polar auxin transport, is directional, very strictly regulated, and based in uneven distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins in the proper direction. While PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are vital in transporting auxin in a polar manner, the family of AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX/LAX) genes encodes for non-polar auxin influx carriers.

The regulation of PIN protein localisation in a cell determines the direction of auxin transport from cell, and concentrated effort of many cells creates peaks of auxin, or auxin maxima (regions having cells with higher auxin – a maximum). Proper and timely auxin maxima within developing roots and shoots are necessary to organise the development of the organ. PINs are regulated by multiple pathways, at both the transcriptional and the post-translational levels. PIN proteins can be phosphorylated by PINOID, which determines their apicobasal polarity and thereby the directionality of auxin fluxes. In addition, other AGC kinases, such as D6PK, phosphorylate and activate PIN transporters. AGC kinases, including PINOID and D6PK, target to the plasma membrane via binding to phospholipids. Upstream of D6PK, 3&#x27;-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) acts as a master regulator. PDK1 phosphorylates and activates D6PK at the basal side of plasma membrane, executing the activity of PIN-mediated polar auxin transport and subsequent plant development. 
Surrounding auxin maxima are cells with low auxin troughs, or auxin minima. For example, in the &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; fruit, auxin minima have been shown to be important for its tissue development.

Auxin has a significant effect on spatial and temporal gene expressions during the growth of apical meristems. These interactions depend both on the concentration of Auxin as well as the spatial orientation during primordial positioning. Auxin relies on PIN1 which works as an auxin efflux carrier. PIN1 positioning upon membranes determines the directional flow of the hormone from higher to lower concentrations. Initiation of primordia in apical meristems is correlated to heightened auxin levels.
Genes required to specify the identity of cells arrange and express based on levels of auxin. STM (SHOOT MERISTEMLESS), which helps maintain undifferentiated cells, is down-regulated in the presence of auxin. This allows growing cells to differentiate into various plant tissues. The CUC (CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON) genes set the boundaries for growing tissues and promote growth. They are upregulated via auxin influx. Experiments making use of GFP (GREEN FLUORESCENCE PROTEIN) visualization in Arabidopsis have supported these claims.

===Organization of the plant ===
As auxins contribute to organ shaping, they are also fundamentally required for proper development of the plant itself. Without hormonal regulation and organization, plants would be merely proliferating heaps of similar cells. Auxin employment begins in the embryo of the plant, where the directional distribution of auxin ushers in subsequent growth and development of primary growth poles, then forms buds of future organs. Next, it helps to coordinate proper development of the arising organs, such as roots, cotyledons, and leaves and mediates long-distance signals between them, contributing so to the overall architecture of the plant. Throughout the plant&#x27;s life, auxin helps the plant maintain the polarity of growth, and actually &quot;recognize&quot; where it has its branches (or any organ) connected.

An important principle of plant organization based upon auxin distribution is apical dominance, which means the auxin produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting auxin allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex because auxin transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as strigolactones or cytokinins) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in pruning by horticulturists.

Finally, the sum of auxin arriving from stems to roots influences the degree of root growth. If shoot tips are removed, the plant does not react just by the outgrowth of lateral buds — which are supposed to replace to original lead. It also follows that smaller amount of auxin arriving at the roots results in slower growth of roots and the nutrients are subsequently in higher degree invested in the upper part of the plant, which hence starts to grow faster.
==Effects==

Auxin participates in phototropism, geotropism, hydrotropism and other developmental changes. The uneven distribution of auxin, due to environmental cues, such as unidirectional light or gravity force, results in uneven plant tissue growth, and generally, auxin governs the form and shape of the plant body, direction and strength of growth of all organs, and their mutual interaction. When the cells grow larger, their volume increases as the intracellular solute concentration increases with water moving into the cells from extracellular fluid. This auxin-stimulated intake of water causes turgor pressure on the cell walls, causing the plant to bend.

Auxin stimulates cell elongation by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as expansins, to loosen cell walls. The effect is stronger if gibberellins are also present. Auxin also stimulates cell division if cytokinins are present. When auxin and cytokinin are applied to callus, rooting can be generated with higher auxin to cytokinin ratios, shoot growth is induced by lower auxin to cytokinin ratios, and a callus is formed with intermediate ratios, with the exact threshold ratios depending on the species and the original tissue.
Auxin also induces sugar and mineral accumulation at the site of application.

===Wound response===
Auxin induces the formation and organization of phloem and xylem. When the plant is wounded, the auxin may induce the cell differentiation and regeneration of the vascular tissues.

===Root growth and development===
Auxins promote root initiation. Auxin induces both growth of pre-existing roots and root branching (lateral root initiation), and also adventitious root formation. As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall development of the roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.

In horticulture, auxins, especially NAA and IBA, are commonly applied to stimulate root initiation when rooting cuttings of plants. However, high concentrations of auxin inhibit root elongation and instead enhance adventitious root formation. Removal of the root tip can lead to inhibition of secondary root formation.

===Apical dominance===

Auxin induces shoot apical dominance; the axillary buds are inhibited by auxin, as a high concentration of auxin directly stimulates ethylene synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. This is called decapitation, usually performed in tea plantations and hedge-making. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.

===Fruit growth and development===
Auxin is required for fruit growth and development and delays fruit senescence. When seeds are removed from strawberries, fruit growth is stopped; exogenous auxin stimulates the growth in fruits with seeds removed. For fruit with unfertilized seeds, exogenous auxin results in parthenocarpy (&quot;virgin-fruit&quot; growth).

Fruits form abnormal morphologies when auxin transport is disturbed. In &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; fruits, auxin controls the release of seeds from the fruit (pod). The valve margins are a specialised tissue in pods that regulates when pod will open (dehiscence). Auxin must be removed from the valve margin cells to allow the valve margins to form. This process requires modification of the auxin transporters (PIN proteins).

The evolutionary transition from diploid to triploid endosperms - and the production of antipodal cells - may have occurred due to a shift in gametophyte development which produced a new interaction with an auxin-dependent mechanism originating in the earliest angiosperms.

===Flowering===
Auxin plays also a minor role in the initiation of flowering and development of reproductive organs. In low concentrations, it can delay the senescence of flowers. A number of plant mutants have been described that affect flowering and have deficiencies in either auxin synthesis or transport. In maize, one example is bif2 barren inflorescence2.

===Ethylene biosynthesis===
In low concentrations, auxin can inhibit ethylene formation and transport of precursor in plants; however, high concentrations can induce the synthesis of ethylene. Therefore, the high concentration can induce femaleness of flowers in some species. 

Auxin inhibits abscission prior to the formation of the abscission layer, and thus inhibits senescence of leaves.

== Synthetic auxins ==
In the course of research on auxin biology, many compounds with noticeable auxin activity were synthesized. Many of them had been found to have economical potential for human-controlled growth and development of plants in agronomy.

Auxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, synthetic auxin herbicides, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), have been developed and used for weed control.

However, some exogenously synthesized auxins, especially 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking cuttings of plants or for different agricultural purposes such as the prevention of fruit drop in orchards.

Used in high doses, auxin stimulates the production of ethylene, also a native plant hormone. Excess ethylene can inhibit elongation growth, cause leaves to fall (abscission), and even kill the plant. Some synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are marketed also as herbicides. Dicots, such as dandelions, are much more susceptible to auxins than monocots, such as grasses and cereal crops. So these synthetic auxins are valuable as synthetic herbicides. 2,4-D was the first widely used herbicide, and it is still in use. 2,4-D was first commercialized by the Sherwin-Williams company and saw use in the late 1940s. It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.

Triclopyr (3,5,6-TPA), while known as an herbicide, has also been shown to increase the size of fruit in plants. At increased concentrations, the hormone can be lethal. Dosing down to the correct concentration has been shown to alter photosynthetic pathways. This hindrance to the plant causes a response that increases carbohydrate production, leading to larger fruit.

=== Herbicide manufacture ===
Synthetic auxins are used as a kind of herbicide and overdosing of auxins will interrupt plants&#x27; growth and lead to their death. The defoliant Agent Orange, used extensively by British forces in the Malayan Emergency and American forces in the Vietnam War, was a mix of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. The compound 2,4-D is still in use and is thought to be safe, but 2,4,5-T was more or less banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1979. The dioxin TCDD is an unavoidable contaminant produced in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T. As a result of the integral dioxin contamination, the use of 2,4,5-T products has been implicated in leukemia, miscarriages, birth defects, liver damage, and other diseases.

<text>Cytokinins (CK) are a class of plant hormones that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. They are involved primarily in cell growth and differentiation, but also affect apical dominance, axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence.

There are two types of cytokinins: adenine-type cytokinins represented by kinetin, zeatin, and 6-benzylaminopurine, and phenylurea-type cytokinins like diphenylurea and thidiazuron (TDZ). Most adenine-type cytokinins are synthesized in roots. Cambium and other actively dividing tissues also synthesize cytokinins. No phenylurea cytokinins have been found in plants. Cytokinins participate in local and long-distance signalling, with the same transport mechanism as purines and nucleosides. Typically, cytokinins are transported in the xylem.

Cytokinins act in concert with auxin, another plant growth hormone. The two are complementary,
 having generally opposite effects.

== History ==
The idea of specific substances required for cell division to occur in plants actually dates back to the Swiss physiologist J. Wiesner, who, in 1892, proposed that initiation of cell division is evoked by endogenous factors, indeed a proper balance among endogenous factors. Somewhat later, the Austrian plant physiologist, G. Haberlandt, reported in 1913 that an unknown substance diffuses from the phloem tissue which can induce cell division in the parenchymatic tissue of potato tubers. In 1941, Johannes Van Overbeek found that the milky endosperm of immature coconut also had this factor, which stimulated cell division and differentiation in very young Datura embryos.

Jablonski and Skoog (1954) extended the work of Haberlandt and reported that a substance present in the vascular tissue was responsible for causing cell division in the sith cells. Miller and his co-workers (1954) isolated and purified the cell division substance in crystallised form from autoclaved herring fish sperm DNA. This active compound was named as Kinetin because of its ability to promote cell division and was the first cytokinin to be named. Kinetin was later identified to be 6-furfuryl-amino purine. Later on, the generic name kinin was suggested to include kinetin and other substances having similar properties.

The first naturally occurring cytokinin was isolated and crystallised simultaneously by Miller and D.S. Lethum (1963–65) from the milky endosperm of corn (&quot;Zea mays&quot;) and named Zeatin. Lethem (1963) proposed the term Cytokinins for such substances.

== Function ==

Cytokinins are involved in many plant processes, including cell division and shoot and root morphogenesis. They are known to regulate axillary bud growth and apical dominance. According to the &quot;direct inhibition hypothesis&quot;, these effects result from the ratio of cytokinin to auxin. This theory states that auxin from apical buds travels down shoots to inhibit axillary bud growth. This promotes shoot growth, and restricts lateral branching. Cytokinin moves from the roots into the shoots, eventually signaling lateral bud growth. Simple experiments support this theory. When the apical bud is removed, the axillary buds are uninhibited, lateral growth increases, and plants become bushier. Applying auxin to the cut stem again inhibits lateral dominance. Moreover, it has been shown that cytokinin alone has no effect on parenchyma cells. When cultured with auxin but no cytokinin, they grow large but do not divide. When cytokinin and auxin are both added together, the cells expand and differentiate. When cytokinin and auxin are present in equal levels, the parenchyma cells form an undifferentiated callus. A higher ratio of cytokinin induces growth of shoot buds, while a higher ratio of auxin induces root formation.

Cytokinins have been shown to slow aging of plant organs by preventing protein breakdown, activating protein synthesis, and assembling nutrients from nearby tissues. A study that regulated leaf senescence in tobacco leaves found that wild-type leaves yellowed while transgenic leaves remained mostly green. It was hypothesized that cytokinin may affect enzymes that regulate protein synthesis and degradation.

Cytokinins have recently been found to play a role in plant pathogenesis. For example, cytokinins have been described to induce resistance against &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;. Also in context of biological control of plant diseases cytokinins seem to have potential functions. Production of cytokinins by &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; G20-18 has been identified as a key determinant to efficiently control the infection of &quot;A. thaliana&quot; with &quot;P. syringae.&quot;.

While cytokinin action in vascular plants is described as pleiotropic, this class of plant hormones specifically induces the transition from apical growth to growth via a three-faced apical cell in moss protonema. This
bud induction can be pinpointed to differentiation of a specific single cell, and thus is a very specific effect of cytokinin.

==Mode of action==

Cytokinin signaling in plants is mediated by a two-component phosphorelay. This pathway is initiated by cytokinin binding to a histidine kinase receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This results in the autophosphorylation of the receptor, with the phosphate then being transferred to a phosphotransfer protein. The phosphotransfer proteins can then phosphorylate the type-B response regulators (RR) which are a family of transcriptions factors. The phosphorylated, and thus activated, type-B RRs regulate the transcription of numerous genes, including the type-A &quot;RR&quot;s. The type-A RRs negatively regulate the pathway.

==Biosynthesis==
Adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT) catalyses the first reaction in the biosynthesis of isoprene cytokinins. It may use ATP, ADP, or AMP as substrates and may use dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) or hydroxymethylbutenyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP) as prenyl donors. This reaction is the rate-limiting step in cytokinin biosynthesis. DMADP and HMBDP used in cytokinin biosynthesis are produced by the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP).

Cytokinins can also be produced by recycled tRNAs in plants and bacteria. tRNAs with anticodons that start with a uridine and carrying an already-prenylated adenosine adjacent to the anticodon release on degradation the adenosine as a cytokinin. The prenylation of these adenines is carried out by tRNA-isopentenyltransferase.

Auxin is known to regulate the biosynthesis of cytokinin.

==Uses==
Because cytokinins promote plant cell division and growth, they have been studied since the 1970s as potential agrochemicals, however they have yet to be widely adopted, probably due to the complex nature of their effects. One study found that applying cytokinin to cotton seedlings led to a 5–10% increase in yield under drought conditions. Some cytokinins are utilized in tissue culture of plants and can also be used to promote the germination of seeds.

<doc id="496670" wikidata="Q331818" url="?curid=496670" title="Gibberellin">
<text>Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate various developmental processes, including stem elongation, germination, dormancy, flowering, flower development, and leaf and fruit senescence. They are one of the longest-known classes of plant hormone. It is thought that the selective breeding (albeit unconscious) of crop strains that were deficient in GA synthesis was one of the key drivers of the &quot;green revolution&quot; in the 1960s, a revolution that is credited to have saved over a billion lives worldwide.

==Chemistry==
All known gibberellins are diterpenoid acids synthesized by the terpenoid pathway in plastids and then modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol until they reach their biologically active form. All are derived via the &quot;ent&quot;-gibberellane skeleton, but are synthesised via &quot;ent&quot;-kaurene. The gibberellins are named GA1 through GAn in order of discovery. Gibberellic acid, which was the first gibberellin to be structurally characterized, is GA3.

, there are 136 GAs identified from plants, fungi, and bacteria.

Gibberellins are tetracyclic diterpene acids. There are two classes, with either 19 or 20 carbons. The 19-carbon gibberellins are generally the biologically active forms. They have lost carbon 20 and, in place, possess a five-member lactone bridge that links carbons 4 and 10. Hydroxylation also has a great effect on its biological activity. In general, the most biologically active compounds are dihydroxylated gibberellins, with hydroxyl groups on both carbons 3 and 13. Gibberellic acid is a 19-carbon dihydroxylated gibberellin.

===Bioactive GAs===
The bioactive Gibberellins are GA1, GA3, GA4, and GA7. There are three common structural traits between these GAs: 1) hydroxyl group on C-3β, 2) a carboxyl group on carbon 6, and 3) a lactone between carbons 4 and 10. 

The 3β-hydroxyl group can be exchanged for other functional groups at C-2 and/or C-3 positions. GA5 and GA6 are examples of bioactive GAs without a hydroxyl group on C-3β. The presence of GA1 in various plant species suggests that it is a common bioactive GA.

==Biological function==
Gibberellins are involved in the natural process of breaking dormancy and other aspects of germination. Before the photosynthetic apparatus develops sufficiently in the early stages of germination, the seed reserves of starch nourish the seedling. Usually in germination, the breakdown of starch to glucose in the endosperm begins shortly after the seed is exposed to water. Gibberellins in the seed embryo are believed to signal starch hydrolysis through inducing the synthesis of the enzyme α-amylase in the aleurone cells. In the model for gibberellin-induced production of α-amylase, it is demonstrated that gibberellins from the scutellum diffuse to the aleurone cells, where they stimulate the secretion α-amylase. α-Amylase then hydrolyses starch (abundant in many seeds), into glucose that can be used to produce energy for the seed embryo. Studies of this process have indicated gibberellins cause higher levels of transcription of the gene coding for the α-amylase enzyme, to stimulate the synthesis of α-amylase.

Exposition to cold temperatures increases the production of Gibberellins. They stimulate cell elongation, breaking and budding, and seedless fruits. Gibberellins cause also seed germination by breaking the seed&#x27;s dormancy and acting as a chemical messenger. Its hormone binds to a receptor, and calcium activates the protein calmodulin, and the complex binds to DNA, producing an enzyme to stimulate growth in the embryo.

==Metabolism==
===Biosynthesis===
Gibberellins are usually synthesized from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from &quot;trans&quot;-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP), with the participation of three classes of enzymes: terpene syntheses (TPSs), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 2-oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). The MEP pathway follows eight steps:

# GGDP is converted to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) by &quot;ent&quot;-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS)
# ent-CDP is converted to ent-kaurene by &quot;ent&quot;-kaurene synthase (KS)
# ent-kaurene is converted to ent-kaurenol by &quot;ent&quot;-kaurene oxidase (KO)
# ent-kaurenol is converted to ent-kaurenal by KO
# ent-kaurenal is converted to ent-kaurenoic acid by KO
# ent-kaurenoic acid is converted to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by &quot;ent&quot;-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO)
# ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid is converted to GA12-aldehyde by KAO
# GA12-aldehyde is converted to GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.

One or two genes encode the enzymes responsible for the first steps of GA biosynthesis in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; and rice. The null alleles of the genes encoding CPS, KS, and KO result in GA-deficient &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; dwarves. Multigene families encode the 2ODDs that catalyze the formation of GA12 to bioactive GA4.

AtGA3ox1 and AtGA3ox2, two of the four genes that encode GA3ox in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, affect vegetative development. Environmental stimuli regulate AtGA3ox1 and AtGA3ox2 activity during seed germination. In &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, GA20ox overexpression leads to an increase in GA concentration.

====Sites of biosynthesis====
Most bioactive Gibberellins are located in actively growing organs on plants. Both GA20ox and GA3ox genes (genes coding for GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase) and the SLENDER1 gene (a GA signal transduction gene) are found in growing organs on rice, which suggests bioactive GA synthesis occurs at their site of action in growing organs in plants. During flower development, the tapetum of anthers is believed to be a primary site of GA biosynthesis.

====Differences between biosynthesis in fungi and lower plants====
The flower &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; and the fungus &quot;Gibberella fujikuroi&quot; possess different GA pathways and enzymes. P450s in fungi perform functions analogous to the functions of KAOs in plants. The function of CPS and KS in plants is performed by a single enzyme in fungi (CPS/KS). In plants the Gibberellin biosynthesis genes are found randomly on multiple chromosomes, but in fungi are found on one chromosome

Plants produce low amount of Gibberellic Acid, therefore is produced for industrial purposes by microorganisms. Industrially GA3 can be produced by submerged fermentation, but this process presents low yield with high production costs and hence higher sale value, nevertheless other alternative process to reduce costs of its production is solid-state fermentation (SSF) that allows the use of agro-industrial residues.

===Catabolism===
Several mechanisms for inactivating Giberellins have been identified. 2β-hydroxylation deactivates them, and is catalyzed by GA2-oxidases (GA2oxs). Some GA2oxs use 19-carbon Gibberellins as substrates, while other use C20-GAs. Cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase, encoded by elongated uppermost internode (eui), converts Gibberellins into 16α,17-epoxides. Rice eui mutants amass bioactive Gibberellins at high levels, which suggests cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase is a main enzyme responsible for deactivation GA in rice. The Gamt1 and gamt2 genes encode enzymes that methylate the C-6 carboxyl group of GAs. In a gamt1 and gamt2 mutant, concentrations of GA in developing seeds is increased.

===Homeostasis===
Feedback and feedforward regulation maintains the levels of bioactive Gibberellins in plants. Levels of AtGA20ox1 and AtGA3ox1 expression are increased in a Gibberellin deficient environment, and decreased after the addition of bioactive GAs, Conversely, expression of the Gibberellin deactivation genes AtGA2ox1 and AtGA2ox2 is increased with addition of Gibberellins.

==Regulation==

===Regulation by other hormones===
The auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) regulates concentration of GA1 in elongating internodes in peas. Removal of IAA by removal of the apical bud, the auxin source, reduces the concentration of GA1, and reintroduction of IAA reverses these effects to increase the concentration of GA1. This has also been observed in tobacco plants. Auxin increases GA 3-oxidation and decreases GA 2-oxidation in barley. Auxin also regulates GA biosynthesis during fruit development in peas. These discoveries in different plant species suggest the auxin regulation of GA metabolism may be a universal mechanism.

Ethylene decreases the concentration of bioactive GAs.

===Regulation by environmental factors===
Recent evidence suggests fluctuations in GA concentration influence light-regulated seed germination, photomorphogenesis during de-etiolation, and photoperiod regulation of stem elongation and flowering. Microarray analysis showed about one fourth cold-responsive genes are related to GA-regulated genes, which suggests GA influences response to cold temperatures. Plants reduce growth rate when exposed to stress. A relationship between GA levels and amount of stress experienced has been suggested in barley.

===Role in seed development===
Bioactive GAs and abscisic acid (ABA) levels have an inverse relationship and regulate seed development and germination. Levels of FUS3, an &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; transcription factor, are upregulated by ABA and downregulated by Giberellins, which suggests that there is a regulation loop that establishes the balance of Gibberellins and Abscisic Acid.

In the practice, this means that farmers can alter this balance to make all fruits mature a little later, at a same time, or &#x27;glue&#x27; the fruit in the trees until the harvest day (because ABA participates in the maturation of the fruits, and many crops mature and drop a few fruits a day for several weeks, that is undesirable for markets).

==Signalling mechanism==

=== Receptor ===
In the early 1990s, there were several lines of evidence that suggested the existence of a GA receptor in oat seeds located at the plasma membrane. However, despite intensive research, to date, no membrane-bound GA receptor has been isolated. This, along with the discovery of a soluble receptor, GA insensitive dwarf 1 (GID1) has led many to doubt that a membrane-bound receptor exists.GID1 was first identified in rice and in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; there are three orthologs of GID1, AtGID1a, b, and c. GID1s have a high affinity for bioactive GAs. GA binds to a specific binding pocket on GID1; the C3-hydroxyl on GA makes contact with tyrosine-31 in the GID1 binding pocket. GA binding to GID1 causes changes in GID1 structure, causing a &#x27;lid&#x27; on GID1 to cover the GA binding pocket. The movement of this lid results in the exposure of a surface which enables the binding of GID1 to DELLA proteins.

===DELLA proteins: Repression of a repressor===
DELLA proteins (such as SLR1 in rice or GAI and RGA in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;) are repressors of plant development, characterized by the presence of a DELLA motif (aspartate-glutamate-leucine-leucine-alanine or D-E-L-L-A in the single letter amino acid code).

DELLAs inhibit seed germination, seed growth, flowering and GA reverses these effects. 
When Gibberellins bind to the GID1 receptor, it enhances the interaction between GID1 and DELLA proteins, forming a GA-GID1-DELLA complex. In that complex it is thought that the structure of DELLA proteins experience changes, enabling their binding to F-box proteins for their degradation. F-box proteins (SLY1 in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; or GID2 in rice) catalyse the addition of ubiquitin to their targets. Adding ubiquitin to DELLA proteins promotes their degradation via the 26S-proteosome. This releases cells from DELLAs repressive effects.

=== Targets of DELLA proteins ===

==== Transcription factors ====
The first targets of DELLA proteins identified were Phytochrome Interacting Factors (PIFs). PIFs are transcription factors that negatively regulate light signalling and are strong promoters of elongation growth. In the presence of GA, DELLAs are degraded and this then allows PIFs to promote elongation. It was later found that DELLAs repress a large number of other transcription factors, among which are positive regulators of auxin, brassinosteroid and ethylene signalling. DELLAs can repress transcription factors either by stopping their binding to DNA or by promoting their degradation.

==== Prefoldins and microtubule assembly ====
In addition to repressing transcription factors, DELLAs also bind to prefoldins (PFDs). PFDs are molecular chaperones (they assist in the folding of other proteins) that work in the cytosol, but when DELLAs bind to them are restricted to the nucleus. An important function of PFDs is to assist in the folding of β-tubulin, a vital component of the cytoskeleton in the form of microtubules. As such, in the absence of Gibberellins (high level of DELLA proteins), PFDs reduce its activity, leading to a lower cellular pool of β-tubulin. When GA is present the DELLAs are degraded, PFDs can move to the cytosol and assist in the folding of β-tubulin. As such, GA allows for re-organisation of the cytoskeleton, and the elongation of cells.

Microtubules are also required for the trafficking of membrane vesicles, that is needed for the correct positioning of several hormone transporters. One of the most well characterized hormone transporters are PIN proteins, which are responsible for the movement of the hormone auxin between cells. In the absence of Gibberellins, DELLA proteins reduce the levels of microtubules and thereby inhibit membrane vesicle trafficking. This reduces the level of PIN proteins at the cell membrane, and the level of auxin in the cell. GA reverses this process and allows for PIN protein trafficking to the cell membrane to enhance the level of auxin in the cell.

<text>In the U.S. legal system, service of process is the procedure by which a party to a lawsuit gives an appropriate notice of initial legal action to another party (such as a defendant), court, or administrative body in an effort to exercise jurisdiction over that person so as to force that person to respond to the proceeding in a court, body, or other tribunal.

Notice is furnished by delivering a set of court documents (called &quot;process&quot;) to the person to be served.

==Service==
Each jurisdiction has rules regarding the appropriate service of process. Typically, a summons and other related documents must be served upon the defendant personally, or in some cases upon another person of suitable age and discretion at the person&#x27;s residence or place of business or employment. In some cases, service of process may be effected through the mail as in some small claims court procedures. In exceptional cases, other forms of service may be authorized by procedural rules or court order, including service by publication when an individual cannot be located in a particular jurisdiction.

Proper service of process initially establishes personal jurisdiction of the court over the person served. If the defendant ignores further pleadings or fails to participate in the proceedings, then the court or administrative body may find the defendant in default and award relief to the claimant, petitioner or plaintiff. The defendant may contest the default in the defendant&#x27;s home state. Service of process must be distinguished from service of subsequent documents (such as pleadings and motion papers) between the parties to the litigation.

Service of process in cases filed in the United States district courts is governed by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In England and Wales, the rules governing service of documents are contained within Part 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (as well as the Practice Directions). In Canada the rules vary from province to province and can be governed differently depending on what the type of case (i.e. family, small claims, criminal, etc.).

Service on a defendant who resides in a country outside the jurisdiction of a court must comply with special procedures prescribed under the Hague Service Convention if the recipient&#x27;s country is a signatory. Service on defendants in many South American countries and some other countries is effected through the letter rogatory process. Where a defendant&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown, a court may permit service by publication, usually in a newspaper.

==Manner of service==

===Substituted service===
When an individual party to be served is unavailable for personal service, many jurisdictions allow for substituted service. Substituted service allows the process server to leave service documents with another responsible individual, called a person of suitable age and discretion, such as a cohabiting adult or a teenager. Under the U.S. Federal Rules, substituted service may only be made at the abode or dwelling of the defendant. California, New York, Illinois, and many other United States jurisdictions require that in addition to substituted service, the documents be mailed to the recipient. Substituted service often requires a serving party show that ordinary service is impracticable, that due diligence has been made to attempt to make personal service by delivery, and that substituted service will reach the party and effect notice.

Another method of substituted service is &quot;service by publication&quot; also called &quot;constructive service&quot; in some jurisdictions. Service by publication is used to give &quot;constructive notice&quot; to a defendant who is intentionally absent, in hiding, or unknown (such as a possible descendant of a former landowner), and only when allowed by a judge&#x27;s order based on a sworn declaration of the inability to find the defendant after &quot;due diligence&quot;. Service by publication is commonly used in a divorce action to serve a spouse who has disappeared without leaving a forwarding address. Service by publication usually involves placing the petition for divorce and the summons to a missing spouse in a local newspaper.

In divorce cases, most states that permit service by publication will require due diligence to locate the missing spouse, which can include verifying with the post office that there is no forwarding address; contacting in writing all friends, relatives, and former employers of a spouse who may know the spouse&#x27;s current address; checking all jails and prisons for any record of a spouse; and checking military records for a spouse.
In addition, in some jurisdictions, substituted service may be effected through motion and public notice, followed by sending the documents by certified mail.

Courts in at least two Canadian provincial jurisdictions have allowed for substituted service via Facebook. In 2018, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice allowed service via Instagram and LinkedIn&#x27;s built-in messaging systems.

===Service by mail===
Service by mail is permitted by most U.S. jurisdictions for service on defendants located in other U.S. states or foreign countries. Service by mail is not available if the country of destination has filed objections to service by mail pursuant to the multinational Hague Service Convention. In California, &quot;Any person providing the [California Department of Motor Vehicles] with a mailing address shall consent to
receive service of process&quot;.

===Voluntary acceptance of service (United States)===
As a substitute for personal service by a process server, some jurisdictions may allow voluntary acceptance of service, also called waiver of service. It means that the served party agrees to voluntarily acknowledge receipt of the complaint or petition without the need to engage a process server.

Acceptance or waiver of service is encouraged by some court systems, especially U.S. federal courts. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4(d)(2), when a defendant refuses to waive service &quot;without good cause&quot;, the defendant can be held liable for the cost of personal service.

===Personal service by court services process server===
Personal service is service of process directly to a party named on the summons, complaint, or petition. In most lawsuits in the United States, personal service is required to prove service. Most states allow substituted service in almost all lawsuits unless a corporation, LLC, LLP, or other business entity is being served; in those cases, personal service must be achieved by serving the documents to the registered agent of a business entity. Some states, e.g. Florida, do not require that the documents actually be handed to the individual. In California and most other states, the documents must be visible to the person being served, i.e., not in a sealed envelope. If the individual refuses to accept service, flees, closes the door, etc., and the individual has been positively identified as the person to be served, the documents may be &quot;drop served&quot; (placed as close to the individual as possible); this is considered a valid service. In the US, personal service of process has been the hallmark for initiating litigation for nearly 100 years, primarily because it guarantees actual notice to the defendant of a legal action.

===Common law systems in the United States===

In most states a person that serves the process simply must be 18 years of age or older and not a party to the litigation.

Most jurisdictions require or permit process to be served by a court official, such as a sheriff, marshal, constable, or bailiff. There may be licensing requirements for private process servers, as is the case in New York City, Alaska, Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Montana, Nevada, and Oklahoma. Arizona process servers are required to apply for certification with the clerk of the Superior Court in the county in which they reside. Non-resident applicants may apply in any county. Texas process servers are currently certified by order of the Texas Supreme Court and are regulated through the Process Server Review Board, consisting of members of the industry authorized by the supreme court.

Other jurisdictions require a court order allowing a private person to serve process. Many private investigators perform process serving duties. Texas and Florida also have a required training course which must be completed prior to certification.

An example of such a license would be in Rhode Island, where an applicant must complete 90 days of training with a constable that has &#x27;full powers&#x27;. Once the 90 days of training is complete, a test is given at the local courthouse from the laws included in the constable manual. Once an applicant passed the written exam, one will be scheduled for an oral interview with the disciplinary board. If they find the applicant to be competent, they will pass a recommendation to the chief judge who will then swear in one with &#x27;limited power&#x27;. These constables can only serve within the county they are appointed. After one year, a limited power constable can apply for his/her full powers to arrest, evict, and be able to serve statewide.

In New York State, personal process is &quot;required&quot; in divorce and similar matrimonial law actions, absent court permission. Specific practice is that: See CPLR 308 and DRL 232.

===Federal (United States)===
The service of federal civil process in the United States is governed by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4. Any person who is at least 18 years of age and is not a party to the case may serve a federal civil summons and complaint. This general rule also applies to the service of federal subpoenas under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 45.

===Civil law systems===
In civil law jurisdictions, which include all of Continental Europe and most Asian, African, and South American countries, service of process is generally performed by the court. This may be done in person by a bailiff, or by mail, depending on the jurisdiction.

===International service===

International service of foreign judicial and extrajudicial documents is governed in general by the 1965 Hague Service Convention. Prior to the enactment of the Hague Service Convention, service of process in civil cases was generally effected by a letter rogatory, a formal request from the court in the country where proceedings were initiated or underway to a court in another country where the defendant resided. This procedure generally required the use of consular and diplomatic channels as the request had to be made to the foreign minister (the Secretary of State in the United States) of the defendant&#x27;s country by the foreign minister of the originating court.

Since 1965, member states designate a central authority for service of process and requests go directly there. In addition, many states allow some type of service directly by mail or personal service by a person otherwise authorized to service process without involvement of local courts.

==Agent for acceptance of service==
In some instances, delivery to an agent for acceptance of service or &quot;registered agent&quot; can substitute for personal service on the principal party to be served. The registered agent is a person or company authorized in advance to accept service on behalf of the served party. For example, most corporations are required by local law to maintain a local agent of record for acceptance of service in each jurisdiction where they actively conduct business with the public. The identity of the agent for service can usually be ascertained by searching company filings with appropriate state corporate records or business registration agencies (often the business entity division of a state&#x27;s secretary of state. Generally, these business registration records are searchable by the public on the secretary of state&#x27;s website.

In the UK an agent for acceptance of service is generally known as a process agent and is a contractual relationship rather than a statutory one.

==Return of service==
Once service of process has been effected, the responsible officer or process server must typically file a return of service or proof of service or affidavit of service with the court (or convey one to the plaintiff to file with the court). The return of service indicates the time and place at which service was effected, the person served, and any additional information needed to establish that service was properly made. It is signed by the process server, and operates as &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence that service of process was effectively made.

Arizona Court Rules also require that any return or affidavit of service filed by a process server other than a sheriff or constable shall clearly state the county in which the process server is registered. Many Arizona process servers include their certification number on their returns/affidavits. Certification numbers are assigned by the clerk of the superior court in each county.

==Process serving laws (United States)==
Many states have process serving laws that govern the way service of process is effected, the licensing requirements to effect service, the forms to be used and the time deadlines that service of process may be accomplished upon individual respondents and corporations. These differences may be vast. For example, in New York, service of process may require licensing of the process server; in Pennsylvania, process may only be served by the sheriff or a sheriff&#x27;s deputy in most cases (except in Philadelphia, where process may be served &quot;by any competent adult&quot;); and in New Jersey, process is effected if, after making an affidavit that diligent efforts to effect personal service had failed, the party sends two copies of the pleading by mail—one by regular mail and one by certified mail, return receipt requested—and either the certified mail receipt is returned signed or the certified mail envelope is returned unclaimed and the regular mail is not returned to the sender. Generally, there are specific procedures and rules for most courts, from local small claims courts to United States District courts. Each court has specific rules, forms, guidelines and procedures which must be followed in order to successfully effect service of process. Failure to follow these guidelines may deem the attempted service improper. Indeed, many defendants in court hearings use the affirmative defense of &quot;I was not served&quot; as an often successful line of defense in any lawsuit. Not surprisingly, this defense tends to be effective in many cases because service of process upon defendant did not follow legal procedure. As for United States federal courts, service of process rules are in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, upon which most state service of process laws are based.

===Jurisdiction===
It is universal that the laws of service of process must follow the laws that apply to the court that issues the process. A bias or confusion occurs in many jurisdictions where service is made. In Florida, for example, process servers seem to suggest Florida laws apply to all service of process made within the territory of Florida. In this reference, section 48.195 implies an authority of Florida process servers to serve foreign process. This was added to allow sheriffs to serve foreign process within limitations as the section provides, but it does not, and cannot give exclusivity, to &quot;state-sanctioned licensed approved process servers to foreign process&quot;. This interpretation, however prevalent and beneficial to Florida process servers, is false.

Florida governs only those processes that are issued from &quot;Florida courts&quot;. An example would be a Wisconsin court process to be served upon a person in Florida. Wisconsin statutes would dictate the service requirements to the Florida participant. Simply, a person must be uninterested, a resident of Florida, and over the age of 18. This is not a popular position as many process servers who have a local Florida license prefer, for reasons of economics, to be considered the only legitimate process server for such a cause. This Wisconsin example is in the majority for all states in the US regarding out of state service in their jurisdiction. There are however a small number of states, such as Arizona, that permit a person of one state (e.g. Arizona) to serve another person in another state (e.g. Florida). The aforementioned Arizona rule is an exception to the majority of other states that require a process server to be 18 and over and an uninvolved party to serve its process in another state. Arizona law has never been challenged on the grounds of sovereignty as Arizona&#x27;s statutes appear to give its courts legislative and judicial authority for its people to serve a person in a foreign state.

In states where Indian reservations are located, the state generally has no legal jurisdiction over Indian territory – recognized tribes enjoy legal status as a sovereign nation. Thus a process server certified under the authority of the state (i.e. Arizona) cannot serve a party to a case while that person is on the reservation unless the tribal council consents to permit service.

===Trespassing===
In nearly every state of the United States, process servers are restricted from trespassing on property as a means of serving process. Such invasions, no matter how innocuous, are regarded as not only invalid, but illegal and may result in penalties for offenders. Gated communities and apartment buildings have created a difficulty for process servers; however, most are required to allow process servers to enter them. However, this fact may be overcome where the process server is in the direct employment of a law enforcement agency, such as the U.S. Marshals Service, a county sheriff&#x27;s department, or other law enforcement agency having responsibility to serve documents.

In California, &quot;Registered Process Servers&quot; are granted &quot;...a limited exemption against trespassing in gated communities.&quot; This allows servers to enter a private property for a reasonable period of time to attempt service of process. In California, gated communities which are &quot;...staffed by a security guard, or where access is controlled, must allow a Registered Process Server to enter for service of process upon presenting valid identification, and indicating to which address the process server is going.&quot; This does not prevent the security guard from contacting the resident and alerting them that a process server is on his way to their residence.

In Washington, &quot;Registered Process Servers&quot; are granted a limited exemption or affirmative defense against trespassing:
===Deadlines===
Most states have a deadline for completing service of process after filing of the summons and complaint. In New York, for example, service must be completed in 120 days after filing for almost all cases, and Hawaii state circuit courts require service in a civil lawsuit must be effected within six months from commencing suit.

===&quot;Dies non juridicum&quot;===
Some states prohibit the delivery or serving of documents on Sundays, holidays or election days (&quot;dies non juridicum&quot;). However, some states will allow the service of documents under special circumstances. One such circumstance is when the service of process is pursuant to a court order.

According to various laws, service of process cannot be performed on Sundays in Florida (unless with a court order), Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee (unless with a court order), Texas, Virginia, or West Virginia. It can also not be performed on election days or at a place of religious service on Sunday in Michigan, or on holidays in Minnesota. Finally, in New York, process cannot be served on Saturday upon a person who keeps Saturday as holy time.

===GPS certification===
In 2011, New York&#x27;s City Council enacted a regulation requiring process servers to use GPS to prove that they attempted to locate someone. The data is stored for seven years. Those who attempt the deceit of “sewer service&quot; (dumping papers) can be sued.

<doc id="496675" wikidata="Q188726" url="?curid=496675" title="Anthony Minghella">
<text>Anthony Minghella (6 January 195418 March 2008) was a British film director, playwright, and screenwriter. He was chairman of the board of Governors at the British Film Institute between 2003 and 2007. He directed &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot; (1990), &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996), &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), and &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003), and produced &quot;Iris&quot; (2001).

He received the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;The English Patient&quot;. In addition, he received three more Academy Award nominations; he was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay for both &quot;The English Patient&quot; and &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, and was posthumously nominated for Best Picture for &quot;The Reader&quot; (2008), as a producer.

==Early life and education==
Minghella was born in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. His family are well known on the island, where they ran a café in Ryde until the 1980s and have run an eponymous business making and selling Italian-style ice cream since the 1950s. His parents were Edoardo Minghella (an Italian immigrant) and Leeds-born Gloria Alberta (née Arcari). His mother&#x27;s ancestors originally came from Valvori, a small village in southern Lazio, Italy. He was one of five children, his sisters Gioia Minghella-Giddens, Edana Minghella and Loretta Minghella, and a brother Dominic Minghella who also became a screenwriter and producer.

Minghella attended St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Ryde, Sandown Grammar School, and St John&#x27;s College, Portsmouth. Early interests suggested a possible career as a musician, with Minghella playing keyboards with local bands Earthlight and Dancer. The latter recorded an album titled &quot;Tales of the Riverbank&quot; in 1972, although it was not released until 2001.

He attended the University of Hull, studying drama. As an undergraduate he had arrived at university with an EMI contract for the band, in which he sang and played keyboards; while at university he wrote words and music for an adaptation of Gabriel Josipovici&#x27;s &quot;Mobius the Stripper&quot; (1975) .

Minghella graduated after three years and stayed on to pursue a PhD. He also taught at the university for several years, on Samuel Beckett and on the medieval theatre. Ultimately, he abandoned his pursuit of a PhD to work for the BBC.

==Career==
Minghella&#x27;s debut work was a stage adaptation of Gabriel Josipovici&#x27;s &quot;Mobius the Stripper&quot; (1975) and it was his &quot;Whale Music&quot; (1985) that brought him notice. His double bill of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Happy Days&quot; was his directorial debut and debut feature film as a director was &quot;A Little Like Drowning&quot; (1978). During the 1980s, he worked in television, starting as a runner on &quot;Magpie&quot; before moving into script editing the children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Grange Hill&quot; for the BBC and later writing &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; series for Jim Henson. He wrote several episodes of the ITV detective drama &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; and an episode of long-running ITV drama &quot;Boon&quot;. &quot;Made in Bangkok&quot; (1986) found mainstream success in the West End.

Radio success followed with a Giles Cooper Award for the radio drama &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate&quot; first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1988. It was revived on 3 May 2008 as a tribute to its author director following his death. His production starred Juliet Stevenson, Bill Nighy and Jenny Howe. His first radio play &quot;Hang Up&quot;, starring Anton Lesser and Juliet Stevenson, was revived on 10 May 2008 as part of the BBC Radio 4 Minghella season.

&quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot; (1990), a feature drama written and directed for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Screen Two&quot; anthology strand, bypassed TV broadcast and instead had a cinema release. He turned down an offer to direct another Inspector Morse to do the project, even though he believed that the Morse episode would have been a much higher-profile ll assignment. &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996) brought him two Academy Awards nominations, Best Director (which he won) and Adapted Screenplay. He also received an Adapted Screenplay nomination for &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999).

His adaptation of &quot;The No. 1 Ladies&#x27; Detective Agency&quot;, which he co-wrote and directed, was broadcast posthumously on BBC One (23 March 2008) as a TV movie; watched by 6.3 million viewers. He vocally supported &quot;I Know I&#x27;m Not Alone&quot;, a film of musician Michael Franti&#x27;s peacemaking excursions into Iraq, Palestine and Israel. He directed a party election broadcast for the Labour Party in 2005. The short film depicted Tony Blair and Gordon Brown working together and was criticised for being insincere: &quot;The Anthony Minghella party political broadcast last year was full of body language fibs&quot;, said Peter Collett, a psychologist at the University of Oxford. &quot;When you are talking to me, I&#x27;ll give you my full attention only if I think you are very high status or if I love you. On that party political broadcast, they are staring at each other like lovers. It is completely false.&quot;

With Samuel Beckett&#x27;s 100th birthday celebrations, he returned to radio on BBC Radio 3 with &quot;Eyes Down Looking&quot; (2006), with: Jude Law, Juliet Stevenson and David Threlfall. An operatic directorial debut came with Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. Premiered at the English National Opera (London, 2005), then at the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre (Vilnius, March 2006) and at the Metropolitan Opera (New York City, September 2006). The latter was transmitted live into cinemas worldwide (7 March 2009) as part of the Met&#x27;s HD series and is now available on DVD. The ENO work was to have led to other operatic projects, directing again at English National Opera and collaborating with Osvaldo Golijov on a new opera for the Met and ENO, writing the libretto and directing the production.

He was honoured with the naming of The Anthony Minghella Theatre at the Quay Arts Centre (Isle of Wight). He made an appearance in the 2007 film &quot;Atonement&quot; as a television host interviewing the novelist central to the story.

His last work was the screenplay of the film adaptation of the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Nine&quot; (1982); Arthur Kopit (book) and Maury Yeston (score). It is based on the film &quot;8½&quot;. He shared credit with Michael Tolkin on the screenplay.

The department of Film, Theatre &amp; Television at the University of Reading, opened in 2012, was named in his honour.

==Personal life and death==
Minghella met his first wife, Yvonne Millar, when they were students. They had one daughter, Hannah. Minghella and Millar eventually divorced. In 1985 Minghella married Hong Kong–born choreographer and dancer Carolyn Jane Choa. They had one son, Max.

Minghella&#x27;s younger brother, Dominic Minghella, is the creator of the television series &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;Doc Martin&quot;. His sister, Loretta Minghella, is Master of Clare College, Cambridge.

Minghella was a fan of Portsmouth F.C., and appeared in the Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Game&quot;. His home had two double bedrooms dedicated to the display of Portsmouth memorabilia dating back to the club&#x27;s founding in 1898.

Minghella died of a haemorrhage on 18 March 2008 in Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith, following an operation the previous week to remove cancer of the tonsils and neck.

==Memorial plaques==
A memorial plaque to Minghella was unveiled on 2 March 2016 by Jude Law, at Western Gardens, Ryde, Isle of Wight.
He is commemorated with a green plaque on The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull. The 2009 film &quot;Nine&quot; is dedicated in his memory.

<doc id="496676" wikidata="Q1140289" url="?curid=496676" title="Sound intensity">
<text>Sound intensity, also known as acoustic intensity, is defined as the power carried by sound waves per unit area in a direction perpendicular to that area, also called the [[sound power]] density and the sound energy flux density. The SI unit of intensity, which includes sound intensity, is the watt per square meter (W/m2). One application is the noise measurement of sound intensity in the air at a listener&#x27;s location as a sound energy quantity.

Sound intensity is not the same physical quantity as sound pressure. Human hearing is sensitive to sound pressure which is related to sound intensity. In consumer audio electronics, the level differences are called &quot;intensity&quot; differences, but sound intensity is a specifically defined quantity and cannot be sensed by a simple microphone.

Sound intensity level is a logarithmic expression of sound intensity relative to a reference intensity.

==Mathematical definition==
Sound intensity, denoted I, is defined by
formula_1
where
* &quot;p&quot; is the sound pressure;
* v is the particle velocity.

Both I and v are vectors, which means that both have a &quot;direction&quot; as well as a magnitude. The direction of sound intensity is the average direction in which energy is flowing.

The average sound intensity during time &quot;T&quot; is given by
formula_2
For a plane wave ,
formula_3
Where,
* formula_4 is frequency of sound, 
* formula_5 is the amplitude of the sound wave particle displacement,
* formula_6 is density of medium in which sound is traveling, and 
* formula_7 is speed of sound.

==Inverse-square law==

For a &quot;spherical&quot; sound wave, the intensity in the radial direction as a function of distance &quot;r&quot; from the centre of the sphere is given by
formula_8
where
* &quot;P&quot; is the sound power;
* &quot;A&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the surface area of a sphere of radius &quot;r&quot;.

Thus sound intensity decreases as 1/&quot;r&quot;2 from the centre of the sphere:
formula_9

This relationship is an &quot;inverse-square law&quot;.

==Sound intensity level==

Sound intensity level (SIL) or acoustic intensity level is the level (a logarithmic quantity) of the intensity of a sound relative to a reference value.

It is denoted &quot;L&quot;&quot;I&quot;, expressed in nepers, bels, or decibels, and defined by
formula_10
where
* &quot;I&quot; is the sound intensity;
* &quot;I&quot;0 is the &quot;reference sound intensity&quot;;
** is the neper;
** is the bel;
** is the decibel.

The commonly used reference sound intensity in air is
formula_11

being approximately the lowest sound intensity hearable by an undamaged human ear under room conditions.
The proper notations for sound intensity level using this reference are or , but the notations , , dBSIL, or dBSIL are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.

The reference sound intensity &quot;I&quot;0 is defined such that a progressive plane wave has the same value of sound intensity level (SIL) and sound pressure level (SPL), since
formula_12

The equality of SIL and SPL requires that
formula_13
where is the reference sound pressure.

For a &quot;progressive&quot; spherical wave,
formula_14
where &quot;z&quot;0 is the characteristic specific acoustic impedance. Thus,
formula_15

In air at ambient temperature, , hence the reference value .

In an anechoic chamber which approximates a free field (no reflection) with a single source, measurements in the far field in SPL can be considered to be equal to measurements in SIL. This fact is exploited to measure sound power in anechoic conditions.

==Measurement==
Sound intensity is defined as the time averaged product of sound pressure and acoustic particle velocity. Both quantities can be directly measured by using a sound intensity &quot;p-u&quot; probe comprising a microphone and a particle velocity sensor, or estimated indirectly by using a &quot;p-p&quot; probe that approximates the particle velocity by integrating the pressure gradient between two closely spaced microphones.

Pressure-based measurement methods are widely used in anechoic conditions for noise quantification purposes. The bias error introduced by a &quot;p-p&quot; probe can be approximated by
formula_16
where formula_17 is the “true” intensity (unaffected by calibration errors), formula_18 is the biased estimate obtained using a &quot;p-p&quot; probe, formula_19 is the root-mean-squared value of the sound pressure, formula_20 is the wave number, formula_6 is the density of air, formula_7 is the speed of sound and formula_23 is the spacing between the two microphones. This expression shows that phase calibration errors are inversely proportional to frequency and microphone spacing and directly proportional to the ratio of the mean square sound pressure to the sound intensity. If the pressure-to-intensity ratio is large then even a small phase mismatch will lead to significant bias errors. In practice, sound intensity measurements cannot be performed accurately when the pressure-intensity index is high, which limits the use of &quot;p-p&quot; intensity probes in environments with high levels of background noise or reflections.
On the other hand, the bias error introduced by a &quot;p-u&quot; probe can be approximated by
formula_24
where formula_25 is the biased estimate obtained using a &quot;p-u&quot; probe, formula_26 and formula_27 are the Fourier transform of sound pressure and particle velocity, formula_28 is the reactive intensity and formula_29 is the &quot;p-u&quot; phase mismatch introduced by calibration errors. Therefore, the phase calibration is critical when measurements are carried out under near field conditions, but not so relevant if the measurements are performed out in the far field. The “reactivity” (the ratio of the reactive to the active intensity) indicates whether this source of error is of concern or not. Compared to pressure-based probes, &quot;p-u&quot; intensity probes are unaffected by the pressure-to-intensity index, enabling the estimation of propagating acoustic energy in unfavorable testing environments provided that the distance to the sound source is sufficient.

<doc id="496677" wikidata="Q26121" url="?curid=496677" title="Daisuke Matsuzaka">
<text>is a Japanese former professional baseball pitcher, who pitched professionally for 23 seasons, 16 of them in NPB, 7 in MLB. He is currently a baseball color commentator, critic, reporter, and YouTuber. Daisuke is nicknamed in Japan and &quot;Dice-K&quot; in the United States by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;. He played for the Boston Red Sox and New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Saitama Seibu Lions, Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).

Matsuzaka was selected the MVP of the inaugural and the second World Baseball Classic, and is an Olympic bronze medalist.

He is the first player to have won both a World Series and a World Baseball Classic, winning the 2006 World Baseball Classic with Team Japan and the 2007 World Series with the Red Sox.

==Early life==
Matsuzaka was born on September 13, 1980, in Koto Ward, He was named after Japanese high school star pitcher Daisuke Araki. Growing up in Koto, Tokyo, he studied kendo from the age of five to nine and began playing organized baseball when he was in third grade.

==High school career==
After excelling at the Little League and junior high level, Daisuke Matsuzaka was admitted into Yokohama High School, a baseball powerhouse, in the spring of 1996. By his second of three years, he had developed into the school&#x27;s ace pitcher. Despite his early success, he would experience a setback that summer when he threw a go-ahead wild pitch in the semi-final game of the Kanagawa Prefecture preliminary round of the National High School Baseball Championship (Summer Koshien).

During that offseason, his fastballs first began to regularly sit around 87 mph (140 km/h). After pitching his school to the championship of the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament (Spring Koshien), Matsuzaka set his aim on the 1998 Summer Koshien and eventually led his school to the championship.

In the quarterfinal of the 1998 Summer Koshien, Matsuzaka threw 250 pitches in 17 innings in a win over PL Gakuen. (The previous day he had thrown a 148-pitch complete game shutout.) The next day, despite trailing 6–0 in the top of the eighth inning, the team miraculously won the game after scoring 7 runs in the final two innings (four in the eighth and three in the ninth). He started the game in left field, but came in as a reliever in the ninth inning to record the win in 15 pitches. In the final, he threw a no-hitter, the second ever in a final. This performance garnered him the attention of many scouts.

Due to the large number of players from the 1998 Summer Koshien cohort who went on to enjoy success at the professional level, baseball players who were born in the 1980 Japanese academic year (from April 2, 1980, to the following April 1, 1981) have been called the &quot;Matsuzaka Generation&quot; in Japan.

==Professional career==
===Saitama Seibu Lions (1999–2006)===
====1998 draft====
After graduating from high school, he was taken by the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) Saitama Seibu Lions with the first pick of the 1998 draft, although both the Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks of the North American Major Leagues also recruited him. At first, Matsuzaka stated that he wanted to play for the Yokohama BayStars, and, if he could not, he would then go to work for a company and after which choose the team of his choice through the reverse-draft (&quot;gyaku-shimei&quot;) system. That changed however, when the manager of the Lions, Osamu Higashio, an accomplished pitcher in his own right, met with Matsuzaka for dinner. At the dinner, Higashio gave Matsuzaka his winning ball for career win number 200. Matsuzaka accepted it and allowed himself to be drafted by the Lions.

Matsuzaka won his first official pro game in his first start of the 1999 season against the Nippon Ham Fighters at the Tokyo Dome. His first career strikeout came against Atsushi Kataoka in the first inning on a high fastball clocked at 155 km/h (96 mph). He won the game, but he also gave up the first home run in the game to Michihiro Ogasawara of the Nippon Ham Fighters.

On May 16, 1999, when Matsuzaka was in his rookie season at age 18, he first faced Ichiro Suzuki, a player for the Orix Bluewave at the time, and recorded three strikeouts in three at-bats with a walk. Matsuzaka states that this game was the moment he started to believe that he &quot;belonged&quot; in pro baseball. However, Ichiro would get a bit of revenge on Matsuzaka by hitting his 100th career home run off him in July of that year.

Matsuzaka started in the All-Star game as a rookie in 1999. He struck out Takuro Ishii and Takanori Suzuki of the Bay Stars before number three hitter Yoshinobu Takahashi of the Giants managed to make contact and fly out to left field.

In his first professional season in 1999, Matsuzaka had 16 wins and five losses as the team ace, and was voted Rookie of the Year. Another rookie pitcher in the rival Central League, Koji Uehara, also won the same honor with a 20-win season. Together, they would come to represent their respective leagues as dominant starting pitchers for seasons to come.

In 2000, Matsuzaka had 14 wins and 7 losses. He had 15 wins and 15 losses in his 2001 season and won the Eiji Sawamura Award.

Matsuzaka spent a considerable portion of his 2002 season on the disabled list, which did not count toward his service time. He was not able to regain his pitching form in the 2002 Japan Series, when the Lions faced the Yomiuri Giants. In Game 1 at Tokyo Dome, where the designated hitter rule is not allowed, Matsuzaka batted 7th in the lineup to take advantage of his above-average hitting for a pitcher. However, not only did Matsuzaka not fare well at the plate in this game, but he also helped the Giants to a rout by giving up two key home runs. One was to extremely popular Giants first baseman Kazuhiro Kiyohara, who hit a middle-of-the-plate Matsuzaka fastball off one of the billboards at the back of the left field stands. Matsuzaka would give up another key RBI to Kiyohara in game 4 in relief, as the Lions were meekly swept by the Giants in the series.

In 2003, Matsuzaka logged 16 wins and 7 losses. He easily won the Pacific League ERA title with a 2.83 mark. Matsuzaka used to play for Japan&#x27;s National Baseball Team, and pitched against South Korea.

He was selected for the NPB All-Star Game in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006. He was voted MVP of the 2004 game.

===Boston Red Sox (2007–2012)===
On October 25, 2006, Scott Boras was announced as Matsuzaka&#x27;s agent to represent him in any contract dealings in the Major Leagues. On November 2, Matsuzaka was officially granted permission by the Lions to pursue a career in Major League Baseball via the posting system.

On November 14, the Boston Red Sox won the bidding rights to Matsuzaka with a bid of $51,111,111.11, outbidding the Texas Rangers, New York Mets, and New York Yankees. The enormous figure — two to three times the Lions&#x27; payroll — astounded both Japanese and American baseball executives. The Red Sox had 30 days to sign Matsuzaka to a contract. If a deal could not be reached, Matsuzaka would have returned to the Lions, nullifying the bid. Scott Boras refused to consider the posting fee as part of the contract negotiations, while Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein recalled, &quot;We tried to come up with a total number, for the post and contract, that made sense.&quot;

On December 11, Epstein, Red Sox owner John W. Henry and CEO Larry Lucchino boarded a plane to &quot;[take] the fight directly to [Boras]&quot;. Nick Cafardo of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; asserted that Boras, by refusing to negotiate, was using Matsuzaka as a protest or &quot;test case of the posting system.&quot;

On December 13, Matsuzaka and Boras joined Red Sox GM Theo Epstein, CEO Larry Lucchino, and Chairman Tom Werner on a private plane owned by Red Sox owner John Henry headed for Boston. During the flight—which was followed by both the Boston and the Japanese media—the group agreed to terms on a contract. Journalist Nobuhiro Chiba characterized Japanese reaction to the signing: &quot;I think the people are relieved to send Daisuke to the Boston Red Sox.&quot; In Boston, Matsuzaka passed his physical and signed a six-year, $52 million contract, which could have been worth as much as $60 million if he fulfilled incentives. The details of the contract included a $2 million signing bonus with a $6 million salary in 2007, $8 million in each of the following three seasons (2008–2010), and $10 million in each of the final two years (2011–2012). He also had a no-trade clause, specially constructed by the Red Sox to fit Matsuzaka&#x27;s contract.

The final agreement was announced Thursday, December 14 at a 5 p.m. EST news conference at Fenway Park. Afterwards some members of the press noted the confusion created by Matsuzaka&#x27;s translator at that announcement. Art Martone of the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; commented, &quot;Matsuzaka&#x27;s interpreter&#x27;s command of the English language was shaky, and thus the pitcher&#x27;s translated comments were brief and, occasionally, unintelligible. About the only clear statement relayed by the interpreter was when Matsuzaka said, &#x27;I&#x27;m very happy and excited to be a member of the Boston Red Sox.&#x27;&quot;
====2007 season====
Matsuzaka&#x27;s first major league spring training took place in Fort Myers, Florida, with the Red Sox during February and March 2007, wearing number 18. Matsuzaka pitched well in most of his exhibition starts. He wears number 18 because Masumi Kuwata also wears number 18. The number is traditionally worn by the ace of a pitching staff in Japan.

Matsuzaka made his first major league regular season start for the Red Sox on April 5, 2007, in an afternoon game against the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium. He walked one, recorded ten strikeouts, and at one point retired ten consecutive batters. He allowed only a solo home run on six hits while throwing 108 pitches (74 for strikes) over seven innings and recorded the win as the Red Sox triumphed by a score of 4–1. He was, however, beaten 3–0 by Félix Hernández (who pitched a one hitter), Ichiro Suzuki, Kenji Johjima, and their Seattle Mariners in his Fenway Park debut on April 11, 2007. He was defeated again, 2–1, by the Toronto Blue Jays in his third major league start despite striking out 10 Toronto hitters in only six innings pitched. Matsuzaka still became the only pitcher to strike out 10 or more batters in two of his first three big-league starts since Fernando Valenzuela did so in 1981.

In the official press conference after the Toronto start, Matsuzaka stated through his interpreter that gripping the American baseball—which is slightly larger than the Japanese pro ball, with higher seams—had presented some challenges, but that he had begun making adjustments and felt they were successful.

Matsuzaka pitched his first complete game in the major leagues on May 14, 2007, a 7–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers. He had pitched 72 complete games in Japan.

Matsuzaka signed a multimillion-dollar exclusive deal with trading card company Upper Deck. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

On September 28, 2007, Matsuzaka went eight innings and threw 119 pitches. He allowed six hits and two runs while striking out eight. With the win against the Minnesota Twins to secure the Red Sox&#x27; place as the winner of the AL East, Matsuzaka closed out his first Major League season with a record of 15–12 and an ERA of 4.40.

On October 6, 2007, Matsuzaka made his Major League playoff debut in the 2007 ALDS, in front of his home crowd in Boston against the visiting Los Angeles Angels. Matsuzaka started the game but lasted just 4.2 innings, giving up three earned runs on seven hits before being pulled. Although Matsuzaka did not get the decision, the Red Sox eventually beat the Angels 6–3.

On October 15, 2007, Matsuzaka started in his second playoff game, in Game 3 of the 2007 ALCS against the Cleveland Indians in Cleveland. Much like his playoff debut, Matsuzaka delivered another mediocre outing. Again, Matsuzaka was not able to make it past five innings, lasting 4.2 innings while giving up four earned runs on six hits, and eventually suffered his first career playoff loss as the Indians beat the Red Sox 4–2. Matsuzaka fared better in Game 7 of the series, on October 21, 2007, retiring the first eight batters he faced. Matsuzaka pitched well for five innings, allowing two runs. The Red Sox won 11–2, to advance to the 2007 World Series against the Colorado Rockies. Matsuzaka is the first Japanese pitcher to win an MLB playoff game and only the fifth rookie to start a Game 7 in the playoffs.

On October 27, 2007, he started and led the Red Sox to a 10–5 win in Game 3 of the 2007 World Series against the Rockies, his first World Series appearance, giving up two runs on three hits while walking three and striking out five. In the game, he also recorded his first major league hit: a two-out two-run single off Josh Fogg, making Matsuzaka the third pitcher in Red Sox history to record two RBIs in a World Series game; the others were Babe Ruth (in Game 4 of the 1918 World Series) and Cy Young. Matsuzaka is also the first Japanese pitcher in World Series history to start and win a game. The next day, the Red Sox won the Series in Game 4. With 201 strikeouts, Matsuzaka ended the year with the Red Sox rookie record for strikeouts in a season.

====2008 season====

In the beginning of 2008 season, Matsuzaka led the Red Sox pitching staff with eight consecutive wins without suffering a single loss. However, on May 27, he left the game against the Seattle Mariners in the bottom of the fifth inning due to a &quot;tired shoulder&quot;. The game resulted in a 4–3 loss. The Red Sox placed Matsuzaka on the disabled list May 30, 2008, with a mild right rotator cuff strain. He returned on June 21 but was the losing pitcher after giving up seven earned runs in just one inning of work against the St. Louis Cardinals. Despite a record of 9–1 and a 3.12 ERA at the break, Matsuzaka was not selected to the 2008 American League All-Star team. On September 15, he won his 17th game of the season, setting a new single-season record for Japanese MLB pitchers, passing previous record holder Hideo Nomo.

Matsuzaka ended the season with an 18–3 record, 2.90 ERA and held opponents to a .211 batting average (and 6.9 hits-per-9-innings), the lowest in the majors. He also led the AL by leaving 80.6 percent of the baserunners he allowed stranded. These numbers were enough to place him fourth in the American League Cy Young Award race. However, a major problem for Matsuzaka was the control of his pitches, which, combined with his lack of innings pitched due to his injury, factored into his Cy Young voting. He walked 94 batters in innings (a major-league-leading 13.1% of all batters he faced), even walking an eye-popping eight in one game against the Detroit Tigers on May 5. Eight times in the 2008 season, Matsuzaka surrendered walks to five or more batters in a game, and 12 times he walked three or more in a game. The interesting statistic is that Matsuzaka was 11–1 in the 16 starts he walked three or more batters, which was a testament to his ability to wiggle out of whatever trouble he got himself into.

Matsuzaka started Game 2 of the 2008 American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and fared well over five-plus innings, handing the ball over to fellow countryman Hideki Okajima. However, Game 1 of the 2008 American League Championship Series was where Matsuzaka had his first solid postseason start. In seven-plus innings, he no-hit the Tampa Bay Rays before giving up a leadoff single to Carl Crawford in the seventh inning. Matsuzaka would earn the win in Boston&#x27;s 2–0 win. However, at home in Game 5, Matsuzaka was rocked in four-plus innings for five runs on five hits, walking two, striking out two, and giving up three home runs to B.J. Upton, Carlos Peña, and Evan Longoria. Boston however staged a miracle comeback to win 8–7. The Rays went on to defeat the Red Sox in seven games to win the 2008 American League pennant.

====2009 season====

When Matsuzaka decided to pitch in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, the Red Sox were concerned with his decision being that it would cause him to miss a majority of spring training. Red Sox manager Terry Francona asked Team Japan manager Tatsunori Hara to keep him updated on Matsuzaka&#x27;s condition along with limiting Matsuzaka&#x27;s pitch count. Throughout the WBC, the Red Sox had limited access to Matsuzaka and decided not to press the issue more with Hara. Matsuzaka went on to lead Team Japan to victory earning the MVP award with a 3–0 record and 2.45 ERA.

On March 27, 2009, Matsuzaka reported to Red Sox spring training only twelve days before opening day. In Matsuzaka&#x27;s first start of the regular season, he gave up three home runs against the Tampa Bay Rays, ultimately losing the game. In his next game against the Oakland Athletics, Matsuzaka only lasted one inning, giving up five hits, five runs, two walks, and striking out none. Matsuzaka was quickly placed on the DL, while reliever Justin Masterson took his spot in the rotation.

Matsuzaka made his next start on May 22, 2009, against the New York Mets after being activated off the DL. He gave up five runs over five innings, receiving another loss. Matsuzaka gained his first win of the season against the Detroit Tigers on June 2, 2009, but failed to produce any quality starts. After a loss against the Atlanta Braves on June 19, 2009, Matsuzaka was once again placed on the disabled list. Red Sox manager Terry Francona stated that Matsuzaka was placed on the DL due to &quot;weakness&quot; in his throwing arm possibly caused by the extensive pitching he did in the World Baseball Classic. Francona also made it clear that it would not be a &quot;two-week DL&quot; stating &quot;We&#x27;re going to have to figure this out. We have a lot of work ahead of us trying to get him back to being Daisuke.&quot;

As of his second placement on the DL in the 2009 season, Matsuzaka held a 1–5 record with an 8.23 ERA. With Matsuzaka&#x27;s placement on the DL, it left a spot open in the starting rotation for John Smoltz to pitch in after being activated off the DL.

Although it has been suggested that the high number of innings pitched early in his career combined with a vigorous personal training regimen is a possible cause of Matsuzaka&#x27;s sustained injury problems in 2009, Matsuzaka himself has stated publicly that he feels he cannot maintain arm strength without extensive training.

On September 15, 2009, Matsuzaka made his first start since June 19. He came and pitched his best outing of the season, pitching six plus shut out innings, striking out five, walking three, and giving up three hits. In October 2009, Matsuzaka revealed that he had in fact injured his hip joint but did not reveal when he got the injury.

In early January 2010, Matsuzaka was interviewed by Japanese magazine &quot;Friday.&quot; During the interview, Matsuzaka revealed that he had in fact injured his right hip while training for the &#x27;09 WBC. When asked why he concealed the injury from Team Japan trainers and coaches, Matsuzaka replied, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be the center of concern for people&quot;, and also added, &quot;[The Classic] was hard. I relied on my wits and my shoulder strength. I had to be creative. I varied the paces between the pitches; I used the different kind of slider that I usually don&#x27;t throw.&quot;

Matsuzaka also apologized to Red Sox fans, saying, &quot;I am very sorry for making you worry. I assure you that the [2010] season will be a great season. I am going to redeem what I lost in 2009. With my health back, I am confident and determined to produce this year. I will [try my best to] become a world champion once again.&quot;

====2010 season====
Matsuzaka missed the first month of the season due to a neck strain. He returned on May 1 against the Orioles and gave up seven runs, six earned, and seven hits in 4.2 innings. Matsuzaka would improve during the season in 2010, going 9–6 with a 4.69 ERA in 25 starts, but fell well below expectations in terms of consistency and efficiency.

====2011 season====
On May 5, 2011, Matsuzaka made his first relief appearance of his MLB career picking up the loss in 1 inning against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim after a two and a half-hour rain delay. On May 17, 2011, Matsuzaka was placed on the 15-day disabled list. On June 2, it was reported that he would be out for the rest of the season due to Tommy John surgery. On June 10, Matsuzaka underwent the surgery.

====2012 season====
On April 23, 2012, Matsuzaka made his first rehab start for the Single-A Salem Red Sox. He gave up a home run in each of his first two innings, and gave up three earned runs in four innings against the Wilmington Blue Rocks, an affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. After stints with both the Portland Sea Dogs and Pawtucket Red Sox, Matsuzaka was activated to make his first major league start of the season on June 9 in Fenway Park against the Washington Nationals, where he allowed four earned runs in five innings. He would finish the year with a very unimpressive record of 1–7 with an 8.28 ERA in 11 starts before becoming a free agent.

===Cleveland Indians===
On February 10, 2013, Matsuzaka agreed to a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians, reuniting him with former Red Sox manager Terry Francona. He did not make the Indians&#x27; Opening Day roster, and was subsequently released from his contract, only to sign another minor league deal in March. Matsuzaka was released from the Indians&#x27; organization per his request on August 20.

===New York Mets===
====2013 season====
On August 22, 2013, Matsuzaka agreed to a major league deal with the New York Mets, and joined their starting rotation. During his stint with the Mets in 2013, Matsuzaka posted a 3–3 record with an ERA of 4.42.

====2014 season====
Matsuzaka agreed to a one-year minor league contract to stay with the Mets for the 2014 season on January 24, 2014. On April 16, 2014, Matsuzaka had his minor league contract purchased by the Mets, replacing pitcher John Lannan on the 40-man roster. On April 24, Matsuzaka earned his second career save (first was in Japan in 2000) in a 4–1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. After the game, Mets manager Terry Collins stated that Matsuzaka was the back up option to current closer Kyle Farnsworth. On May 14, Farnsworth was outrighted to Triple-A by the Mets, leaving the closer role up for grabs, and Matsuzaka as one of the candidates for the job. On May 25, Matsuzaka was given his first start as a Met after 14 relief appearances. In his start, Matsuzaka went six innings and gave up two earned runs on only three hits and got the win in a 4–2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.

===Fukuoka Softbank Hawks (2015–2017)===
Matsuzaka signed a contract with the SoftBank Hawks on December 5, 2014, rejoining Nippon Professional Baseball after eight years in Major League Baseball. Hampered by injuries, Matsuzaka pitched in just one game for the Hawks&#x27; farm team in 2015. In 2016, Matsuzaka appeared in his first NPB game in 10 years. He pitched one inning for the Hawks and allowed two earned runs.

Matsuzaka was able to pitch only one game in three years for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. On November 5, , the Hawks released Matsuzaka.

===Chunichi Dragons (2018–2019)===
On January 23, 2018, Matsuzaka signed with the Chunichi Dragons. On April 5, Matsuzaka started his first game in Japan in 12 years against the Yomiuri Giants, pitching five innings and allowing three earned runs in a 3–2 loss. He was selected for the 2018 NPB All-Star game. After the season, he was awarded &quot;The Best Comeback Prize&quot; of NPB for his 6–4 record.

On October 4, 2019, Matsuzaka left the Dragons after failing to agree to a new deal.

===Saitama Seibu Lions (second stint) (2020–2021) and retirement===
On December 3, 2019, Matsuzaka signed a one-year contract to return to the Lions. Matsuzaka did not play in a game in 2020 after undergoing cervical spine surgery.

In December 2020, Matsuzaka re-signed with the Lions on a one-year deal for the 2021 season. On July 6, 2021, Matsuzaka announced that he would retire at the end of the season. According to sources close to Matsuzaka, he had no sensation in the fingers in his right hand and did not want to cause the team any more trouble. However, he was able to pitch one last time for the Lions in 2021, walking the only batter he faced in an October game.

On December 3, 2021, Matsuzaka formally announced his retirement in a ceremony; the ceremony included a surprise appearance by Ichiro Suzuki.

==International career==
===2004 Olympic Games===
He participated in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. However, he lost the semifinal game to Australia by the score of 1–0. His team later defeated Canada, earning the bronze medal for Japan.

===2006 World Baseball Classic===
In 2006, Matsuzaka pitched for Japan in the inaugural World Baseball Classic. He was crowned the MVP of the first World Baseball Classic after Team Japan defeated Team Cuba 10–6 in the finals. Matsuzaka, the winner of the finale, threw 4 innings of 1 run baseball before exiting. Overall, Matsuzaka pitched a total of 13 innings throughout the tournament while finishing with 3 wins and no losses. There had been talk of Matsuzaka wanting to go to Major League Baseball before the &#x27;06 WBC, and the tournament allowed Matsuzaka to show his skills on the worldwide stage. Interest in Matsuzaka from MLB teams boomed after his performance throughout the WBC.

===2009 World Baseball Classic===
Matsuzaka was a member of the Japanese team at the 2009 World Baseball Classic, playing a key role as they successfully defended their title. He also won his second World Baseball Classic MVP award, finishing the tournament with a 3–0 record and a 2.45 ERA. In all, he pitched 14 innings, allowing 4 runs on 14 hits with 5 walks and 13 strikeouts.

===2013 World Baseball Classic===
Daisuke chose not to play for the Japanese team at the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The team advanced to the semifinal round without Matsuzaka, but failed to claim their third consecutive championship when they lost to Puerto Rico 3–1 in the semifinal round.

==Playing style==
===Pitching===
Matsuzaka is a right-handed pitcher who throws from a three-quarter arm slot in a drop-and-drive motion. He throws numerous pitches in his repertoire: a four-seam fastball that sits at 90–94 mph (topped out at 97 mph in his first few years in Boston), a two-seam fastball in the low 90s, a cutter in the high 80s, a rare gyroball in the low 80s, and a changeup.

===Batting===
Matsuzaka was an accomplished hitter in high school and he got his first hit in his first career at-bat, a single to center, in a game against the Orix BlueWave when the Lions ran out of bench players and had to allow him to hit for himself. The Pacific League employs the designated hitter rule. Matsuzaka&#x27;s first pro home run came in an interleague game against Hanshin Tigers pitcher Darwin Cubillán at spacious Koshien Stadium on June 9, 2006. That footage can be seen in the external links section.

Matsuzaka had his first hit with the Red Sox on May 23, 2010, in Philadelphia. He also was tremendous in the post-season with his bat. He drove in two runs with a single in Game 3 of the 2007 World Series, during a six-run third inning, powering the Red Sox to a victory.

==Personal life==
Matsuzaka is married to television journalist Tomoyo Shibata, formerly of Nippon TV in Japan, and in 2005 she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s daughter. He also has a son, born on March 15, 2008.

Matsuzaka became involved in a scandal when he began dating Shibata. On September 13, 2000, he drove to her apartment without a valid license. He illegally parked his car and it got towed, and then had a team official take the blame to avoid a scandal. The truth soon got out and he was fined 195,000 yen by the police and put under house arrest for one month by the Lions.

In response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Daisuke gave a charitable donation of $1 million to the Japanese Red Cross via the Red Sox Foundation. &quot;Our efforts on the field are dedicated to all who are suffering from this catastrophe. We are in this together, so we must overcome tragedy together.&quot; Matsuzaka said in a video message. He joined with the 3 other Red Sox pitchers, team captain Jason Varitek, and other members of the Red Sox staff to collect fan donations at the gates of two spring training games at City of Palms Park, where they collected more than $4,600 in fan donations.

<text>This article lists the Hellenistic princes and kings of [[Cappadocia]], an ancient region in central Anatolia.

== Independent princes of Cappadocia, 331 BC – 250s BC==
*Ariarathes I, 331–322 BC
The hitherto satrap, Ariarathes I managed to keep control of most or all Cappadocia, as independent prince leading the resistance against conquerors, even after Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of the Persians; however, in 322 BC, he was crucified by Perdiccas, Alexander&#x27;s general and (after Alexander&#x27;s death) regent.
* temporary suppression of independence, governors of Macedon Empire held the country
** governor Eumenes
** diadoch Antigonos, firstly satrap of Phrygia and then Regent. He was killed in Ipsos in 301 BCE.
Perdiccas gave Cappadocia to Eumenes, Alexander&#x27;s former secretary. However, during the instability of the ongoing Wars of the Diadochi, Eumenes was killed, and then the regent Antigonos was killed.

Ariarathes I&#x27;s adopted son, Ariarathes II, managed to re-secure some of his inheritance, namely the mere Upper Cappadocia around Mazaca, and became Prince of Cappadocia (while accepting Seleucid suzerainty). The Lower Cappadocia was lost forever to Kingdom of Pontos which emerged since 301 BCE in the coast of Black Sea, and proclaimed Kingdom in circa 281 BCE.
*Ariarathes II, 301–280 BC
*Ariamnes II, 280–230 BC

== Kings of Cappadocia, 250s BC – 17 AD ==
Possibly continuing a while under weak Seleucid suzerainty, title recognized as Kings:
*Ariarathes III, 255–220 BC, started as co-ruler with his father Ariamnes II
*Ariarathes IV Eusebes, 220–163 BC
*Ariarathes V Eusebes Philopator, 163–130 BC
*Orophernes, 157 BC
*Ariarathes VI Epiphanes Philopator, 130–116 BC
*Ariarathes VII Philometor, 116–101 BC
*Ariarathes VIII, 101–96 BC
*Ariarathes IX, 100-85 BC
*Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios, 95–c. 63 BC
*Ariobarzanes II Philopator, c. 63–51 BC
*Ariobarzanes III Eusebes Philoromaios, 51–42 BC
*Ariarathes X Eusebes Philadelphos, 42–36 BC
*Archelaus, 36 BC–17 AD

<text>Helles or hell is a traditional German pale lager beer, produced chiefly in Southern Germany, particularly Munich. The German word &quot;hell&quot; can be translated as &quot;bright&quot;, &quot;light&quot;, or &quot;pale&quot;.

==Flavour profile==
Helles-style beers typically are full-bodied, mildly sweet and light-coloured, with low bitterness. The beer is clear due to filtration before bottling, although some restaurants and breweries do offer an unfiltered version. Munich-style helles is a yellow beer brewed using cool fermentation with a lager yeast such as &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;, bitter hops such as Hallertau hops, and an original specific gravity (prior to fermentation) between 1.044 and 1.053 (11 to 13 degrees plato), and between 4.5 and 6% alcohol by volume. Helles has a less pronounced hop flavour than German pilsner beers.

==History==
Until the 1960s, Helles was universally available in German-speaking regions. In many regions, Helles was slowly replaced by pilsner-style beers, which was also driven by changing consumer preferences from draft beer to bottled beer. In regions outside of Southern Germany, Helles was regaining popularity in 2010, particularly Berlin, where the beer&#x27;s traditional image has become trendy.

==Distribution==
Helles enjoys great popularity in the Southern German regions of Bavaria, Franconia, and Baden-Württemberg. It can be referred to as , , , &quot;Munich lager&quot;, or &quot;export&quot;. No clear distinction is drawn between lager and export, although export typically is closer in style to Dortmunder Export, which has a slightly higher ABV of 5.5% for extended shelf life.

<doc id="496682" wikidata="Q811519" url="?curid=496682" title="Palisades Interstate Parkway">
<text>The Palisades Interstate Parkway (PIP) is a controlled-access parkway in the U.S. states of New Jersey and New York. The parkway is a major commuter route into New York City from Rockland and Orange counties in New York and Bergen County in New Jersey. The southern terminus of the route is at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where it connects to Interstate 95 (I-95), US 1-9, and US 46. Its northern terminus is at a traffic circle in Fort Montgomery, New York, where the PIP meets US 9W and US 202 at the Bear Mountain Bridge. At exit 18, the PIP forms a concurrency with US 6 for the remaining duration of its run.

The route is named for the Hudson River Palisades, a line of cliffs rising along the western side of the Hudson River. The PIP is designated, but not signed as Route 445 in New Jersey and New York State Route 987C (NY 987C), an unsigned reference route, in New York. As with most parkways in the New York metropolitan area, commercial traffic is prohibited from using the PIP. The Palisades Interstate Parkway was built from 1947 to 1958, and fully opened to traffic on August 28, 1958.

==Route description==

The mainline of the parkway is designated as Route 445 in New Jersey and NY 987C in New York. The latter is one of New York&#x27;s reference routes. A spur connecting the parkway to US 9W in Fort Lee, New Jersey, is designated Route 445S. All three designations are unsigned and used only for inventory purposes. The parkway is owned and maintained by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission but occasional maintenance is performed by the New Jersey and New York state departments of transportation. Commercial vehicles are prohibited on the entire length of the Palisades Interstate Parkway. The speed limit on the highway used to be south of the New York State Thruway and north of it. As of October 2018, it is 55 mph for the entire length.

===New Jersey===
The Palisades Interstate Parkway begins at the George Washington Bridge (GWB) in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Passengers from the upper level of the GWB can directly access the PIP northbound, while passengers from the lower level of the bridge must travel through GWB Plaza on US 9W before getting on the parkway. Passengers traveling northbound on the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) must be in local lanes to directly get on the PIP or be forced to get off the last exit in Fort Lee before the GWB. Once the PIP leaves the GWB, it proceeds north along the New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further north along the parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers going in both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near the northern tip of the island of Manhattan at the Harlem River. After this, the PIP parallels US 9W and the Hudson River for its entire run in New Jersey. The PIP leaves New Jersey into New York in the borough of Rockleigh.

The entire New Jersey portion of the Palisades Interstate Parkway is within Bergen County. It is designated as a state scenic byway known as the Palisades Scenic Byway. The PIP, the New Jersey Turnpike, Interstate 278, and Interstate 676 are the only highways that use sequential exit numbering in New Jersey; all others in the state are based on mileage, except for the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector in Atlantic City, which uses lettered exits (no numerals).

===New York===
The parkway enters Rockland County in the hamlet of Palisades. At about the border the PIP changes direction from due north along the Hudson River to a north-west direction. Shortly after the Kings Ferry Service Area in the center median, the first two exits in New York are key exits for two colleges in Rockland County. Exit 5 provides a link to St. Thomas Aquinas College, and exit 6 provides a link to Dominican College. In West Nyack, the PIP has a key interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-87 and I-287). This intersection is about seven miles (11 km) west of the Tappan Zee Bridge. After the PIP&#x27;s interchange with the NY Thruway, the PIP turns slightly north-east. At exit 13, the PIP intersects US 202 as the route crosses south of Harriman State Park in Mount Ivy. This is the first of two meetings between the PIP and US 202. At exit 15, the PIP has its last busy intersection in Rockland County with County Route 106 (CR 106, formerly part of NY 210) in Stony Point. From here, the PIP enters Harriman State Park, and at exit 16, the PIP intersects Lake Welch Parkway, which is one of several parkways commissioned within the park.

The parkway enters Orange County north of Lake Welch Parkway at exit 16 and south of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission Visitor Center, located in the center median in what was originally a parkway service area. The first interchange in Orange County is exit 17 at Anthony Wayne Recreation Area. At exit 18, the PIP intersects US 6 and Seven Lakes Drive. US 6 west heads toward the Thruway and NY 17 five miles (8 km) west in Harriman. US 6 east forms the PIP&#x27;s only concurrency for the last two miles (3 km) of the PIP&#x27;s run. Seven Lakes Drive joins the two routes for one mile (1.6 km) before departing at exit 19. The two routes then enter Bear Mountain State Park in an eastern direction. Finally, the Palisades Interstate Parkway meets its end at US 9W and US 202 at a traffic circle near the Hudson River and the Bear Mountain Bridge. US 6 and US 202 head east over the bridge, while US 9W heads north toward the United States Military Academy in West Point. (Southbound US 9W, breaking off to the right, is the same road as westbound US 202.)

==History==

In 1933–34, the first thoughts of a Palisades Interstate Parkway were developed by engineer and environmentalist William A. Welch, who was general manager and chief engineer of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The plan was to build a parkway to connect the New Jersey Palisades with the state parks along the Hudson River in Rockland and Orange counties. Welch would soon garner the support of John D. Rockefeller, who donated of land along the New Jersey Palisades overlooking the Hudson River in 1933. With this favorable momentum for the new route, the proposed route was accepted as a Civil Works Administration project under Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal coalition. However, the New Jersey Highway Commission did not support construction, so the idea of a parkway was put on hold. Instead, they built an 8 mile (13 km) road along the western bank of the Hudson River called the Henry Hudson Drive, a small scenic road that is a precursor to the Parkway and is still open today.

During the 1940s, Rockefeller renewed the push for a parkway along the New Jersey Palisades, and teamed with ultimate PIP planner, Robert Moses, to establish and design the parkway. The plan originally was to have the PIP stretch from the Garden State Parkway, along the Hudson River, to the George Washington Bridge, and then north along its present-day route ending at the Bear Mountain Bridge. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April 1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later, paralleling the nearby Henry Hudson Drive. Construction was delayed twice due to material shortages, but that did not stop the PIP from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s. The route was completed in New Jersey in 1957, and on August 28, 1958, the final piece of the PIP was completed between exits 5 and 9 in southern Rockland County.

The PIP is known for its stone arch overpasses throughout its route and its several scenic overlooks in New Jersey. All sorts of unique trees and flowers can be seen along the route as well. In 1998, because of all the natural and constructed beauty, the PIP was designated as a national landmark by the National Park Service.

The Parkway suffered from severe flooding and a minor structural collapse on July 9, 2023 near the Bear Mountain Bridge as a result of severe storms.

==Exit list==
While most highways in the U.S. reset their mile markers and exit numbers when crossing a state line, the Palisades Parkway does not reset either.

<text>Interstate 135 (I-135) is an approximately auxiliary Interstate Highway in central and south-central Kansas, United States. I-135, which is signed as north–south, runs between I-35 and the Kansas Turnpike in Wichita north to I-70, U.S. Highway 40 (US-40), and US-81 in Salina. Except for the first , I-135 overlaps US-81 its entire length. The route also runs through the cities of McPherson, Newton, and Park City.

The highway was designated as Interstate 35W (I-35W) until September 1976, when it was renumbered as I-135 to conform to new AASHTO policies that eliminated most suffixed Interstate Highways. It is currently the longest three-digit &quot;spur&quot;, with an odd first digit, in the Interstate System.

==Route description==
I-135 begins from the south at exit 42 on the Kansas Turnpike. (The exit is signed as I-135/I-235/US-81 for Wichita and Salina.) US-81 joins I-135 later at exit 1A (East 47th Street South) and remains concurrent with it for the rest of its length. Less than from the Kansas Turnpike tollbooth, I-235, a loop around the westside of Wichita, branches off the highway at exit 1C. I-135 continues northward from there, running just east of the Wichita downtown area. It reunites with I-235 at exits 11A and 11B at milepost 11 at the loop&#x27;s other end.

I-135 leaves Wichita and continues northward to Newton where it turns northwest around milemarker 33. The freeway continues in this direction for , returning to a due north course at McPherson.

The stretch of I-135 in Saline County from the Saline–McPherson county line to the highway&#x27;s terminus at I-70, is designated as the Ben E. Vidricksen Highway, in honor of a state senator who was active in pushing for the highway&#x27;s enlargement.
The route ends on the northwest side of Salina, at its intersection at I-70. The road continues as US-81 north of this interchange.

==History==

Construction on the Canal Route portion of I-135 (in Wichita, where the Chisholm Creek Canal runs through the median of the highway) was begun in 1971. This portion of the route took eight years to complete with a cost of $32 million (equivalent to $ in ). It was built through the middle of the city&#x27;s African-American neighborhood, known as McAdams.
Until September 13, 1976, I-135 was signed as Interstate 35W (I-35W). The Interstate&#x27;s full length was completed in December 1979.

In 2021, work began to rebuild the northern junction with I-235 in Wichita. A two-lane flyover ramp connecting northbound I-135 to southbound I-235 which replaced the previous one-lane loop ramp opened on May 31, 2023.

<text>Wardell Edwin Bond (April 9, 1903 – November 5, 1960) was an American character actor who appeared in more than 200 films and starred in the NBC television series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; from 1957 to 1960. Among his best-remembered roles are Bert the cop in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) and Captain Clayton in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956). As a character actor, Bond frequently played cowboys, cops and soldiers.

==Early life==
Bond was born in Benkelman in Dundy County, Nebraska. The Bond family, John W., Mabel L. and sister Bernice, lived in Benkelman until 1919 when they moved to Denver, Colorado, where Bond graduated from East High School.

Bond attended the Colorado School of Mines and then attended the University of Southern California and played football on the same team with future USC coach Jess Hill. At 6&#x27;2&quot; and 195 pounds, Bond was a starting lineman on USC&#x27;s first national-championship team in 1928. He graduated from USC in 1931 with a bachelor of science degree in engineering.

Bond and John Wayne, who had played tackle for USC in 1926 before an injury ended his career, became lifelong friends and colleagues. Bond, Wayne and the entire USC team were hired to appear in &quot;Salute&quot; (1929), a football film starring George O&#x27;Brien and directed by John Ford. During filming, Bond and Wayne befriended Ford, who would later direct them in several films.

==Film career==

Bond made his screen debut in &quot;Salute&quot; and thereafter was a busy character actor, playing over 200 supporting roles. He appeared in 31 films released in 1935 and 23 in 1939. Rarely playing the lead in theatrical films, he starred in the television series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; from 1957 until his death in 1960. He was frequently typecast in extremes, as either a friendly lawman or a brutal henchman. He had a longtime working relationship with directors John Ford and Frank Capra, performing in such films as &quot;The Searchers&quot;, &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot;, &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; and &quot;Fort Apache&quot; for Ford, with whom he made 25 films, and &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;Riding High&quot; for Capra. 

Among his other well-known films were &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941), &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; (1942), &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948), &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959), and Raoul Walsh&#x27;s 1930 widescreen wagon train epic &quot;The Big Trail&quot;, which also featured John Wayne, in his first leading role.

Bond later starred in the popular series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; from 1957 until his death. &quot;Wagon Train&quot; was inspired by the 1950 film &quot;Wagon Master&quot;, in which Bond also appeared. &quot;Wagon Master&quot; was influenced by the earlier &quot;The Big Trail&quot;. For &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, Bond was assigned the lead role of the crusty but compassionate Major Seth Adams, the trail master. 

During the 1940s, Bond was a member of the conservative group called the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, whose major platform was opposition to communists in the film industry.
On the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Movies&quot; list—both the original and the tenth anniversary edition— Bond appears in the casts more often than any other actor, albeit always in a supporting role: &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934), &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), and &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956).

Bond appeared in 13 films that were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture: &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; (1931/32), &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; (1933), &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934) &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937), &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938), &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (1940), &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), &quot;Sergeant York&quot; (1941), &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), and &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1955).

==Personal life and death==
Bond married Doris Sellers Childs in 1936, but they divorced in 1944. In 1954, he married Mary Louise Meyers, and they remained together until his death in November 1960.

Bond was an early and virulent anti–communist.

On November 5, 1960, Bond suffered a massive heart attack while at a hotel in Dallas with his wife. He was pronounced dead at a Dallas hospital at the age of 57. His close friend John Wayne delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Bond&#x27;s will bequeathed to Wayne the shotgun with which Wayne had once accidentally shot Bond on a hunting trip.

On the same day Bond died, country singer Johnny Horton was fatally injured in an automobile accident in Milano, Texas. This led to a rumor that Horton was on his way to Dallas to meet Bond, who was to offer Horton a role on &quot;Wagon Train.&quot; There was no truth to the rumor. Bond&#x27;s actual reason for visiting Dallas was to attend a football game at the Cotton Bowl.

== Legacy ==
For his contribution to the television industry, Bond has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6933 Hollywood Boulevard. It was dedicated on February 8, 1960. In 2001, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.

<doc id="496689" wikidata="Q7976038" url="?curid=496689" title="Wayne Bennett (blues guitarist)">
<text>Wayne Talmadge Bennett (December 13, 1932 – November 28, 1992) was an American blues guitarist, best remembered for his performances and recordings with Bobby Bland between the 1950s and 1980s.

==Biography==
Bennett was born in Sulphur, Oklahoma, later moving with his parents to Ardmore. He started playing guitar in his teens, and performed in local bands. In 1950, he joined Amos Milburn&#x27;s band, and made his first recordings with Milburn in California, on tracks including &quot;Bad, Bad, Whiskey&quot; and &quot;One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot;. 

In the early 1950s Bennett moved to Chicago, where he played in King Kolax&#x27;s band, and toured with The Moonglows. He also recorded in the mid-1950s with such blues musicians as Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Arbee Stidham, Jimmy Reed, and Elmore James. He spent several years in the late 1950s touring and recording with the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, before starting his long working relationship with Bobby Bland. He also studied different styles of guitar. Some of Bennett&#x27;s training included studying guitar with Harry Volpe in New York City for two years; studying harmony with Nate Griffin in Chicago for one year; studying harmony with Junior Mance in Chicago for two years; and studying harmony and ear training with Tony Hanson in Cleveland, Ohio for one year.

He played and recorded with Bobby Bland between the late 1950s and the mid-1960s, and became known for his jazz-tinged blues guitar work. His solo on &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; on Bland&#x27;s album &quot;Here&#x27;s The Man&quot; is still considered by many guitarists to be a classic, drawing both from T-Bone Walker and jazz influences. Another standout solo on Bland&#x27;s &quot;Wishing Well&quot; displays a compelling virtuosity in the blues idiom that would become a model for young guitarists in England such as Eric Clapton who would become part of the British Invasion of the 1960s. 

Bennett himself never liked to claim to be a blues player, preferring instead to be as versatile as he could be, and taking pride in being able to quote from a wide variety of popular music, including TV theme songs. In his earlier years he played a Gibson Byrdland hollow-body, but in later years he was also seen playing a custom Tom Holmes Cadillac solid-body.

In 1965 he joined the Red Saunders band at the Regal Theater in Chicago, and cut his own record in 1968, an instrumental called &quot;Casanova, Your Playing Days are Over&quot; on the now defunct Brunswick label. He was part of Operation Breadbasket in the late 1960s, and worked with jazz musicians, including Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Stitt and Dexter Gordon, as well as later with the Chi-Lites, the Lost Generation, The Hues Corporation; among many others. 

At one time or another Bennett was also a member of the house orchestra at the Apollo in New York, the Howard in Washington, D.C., the Uptown Theatre in Philadelphia and the Royal Theatre in Baltimore. He started playing with Bobby Bland again in the mid-1970s, remaining with him until the mid-1980s. In 1990, he played on Willy DeVille&#x27;s album &quot;Victory Mixture.&quot; 

In 1992, Bennett died in the Veterans Administration Hospital, New Orleans, from heart failure, a week before a scheduled replacement could be transplanted, at the age of 59. Bennett was inducted into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in 2001.

In 2018 the Killer Blues Headstone Project placed a headstone for Wayne Bennett in Providence Cemetery in New Orleans, LA.

<text>Gettysburg College is a private liberal arts college in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1832, the campus is adjacent to the Gettysburg Battlefield. Gettysburg College has about 2,600 students, with roughly equal numbers of men and women. Gettysburg students come from 41 states, Washington, D.C., and 39 countries.

The school hosts 24 NCAA Division III men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams, known as the Bullets, and many club, intramural, and recreational sports programs.

==History==


=== Founding and early roots ===
Gettysburg College was founded in 1832 as a sister institution for the Lutheran Theological Seminary; the latter is now a campus of the United Lutheran Seminary. Both owe their inception to Thaddeus Stevens, a Radical Republican and abolitionist from Gettysburg. The college&#x27;s original name was Pennsylvania College; it was founded by Samuel Simon Schmucker.

In 1839, seven years after Gettysburg College was first founded, doctors George McClellan (founder of Jefferson Medical College), Samuel George Morton, and others, founded the Medical School of Pennsylvania College in Philadelphia. The school had money troubles within four years, forcing all founding members to leave their posts. After a failed agreement to combine with the Philadelphia College of Medicine in 1858 (closed in 1859, with the faculty being integrated into Pennsylvania Medical College), the college was forced to close the medical school in 1861. Students from the seceding southern states had withdrawn to return home, leaving it without adequate revenue.

===Battle of Gettysburg===
In June 1863, southern Pennsylvania was invaded by Confederate forces during the Gettysburg Campaign. Many local militia forces were formed around the area between Chambersburg and Philadelphia to face the oncoming foe.

Among these units was Gettysburg&#x27;s 26th Pennsylvania Emergency Militia Regiment (PEMR). Composed mostly of students from the college and seminary, the 26th PEMR was mustered into service on June 22, 1863. Four days later, the students saw combat just north of town, skirmishing with advanced units of Confederate division commander Jubal A. Early. Casualties were light on both sides, but about 100 of the militiamen were captured and paroled.

During the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania Hall, also known as Old Dorm, was used as both a signal corps station and field hospital. Due to the geographic position it held, it was used by both Confederate and Union troops at different points during the battle.

On November 19, 1863, college president Henry Louis Baugher gave the benediction at the ceremony opening the Soldiers’ National Cemetery at Gettysburg; speaking after Abraham Lincoln. Classes were cancelled at the college and students and faculty walked with the parade to the cemetery to hear the now famous Gettysburg Address. This walk was later recreated for the now annual tradition of the &quot;First Year Walk.&quot; Baugher was the president of Gettysburg College from 1850 until his death in 1868.

Due to its close relationship with this crucial battle, Gettysburg College hosts a number of activities and awards:

* Pennsylvania Hall, located in the center of campus, was occupied by both Union and Confederate forces during the battle. Today, a Civil War era-style flag (for the year 1863) flies above the building, which was used as a lookout position and a field hospital during the battle.
* In 1982, professor and historian Gabor Boritt founded the Civil War Institute, which hosts annual seminars and tours on Civil War themes. Scholarships are granted to high school students and history teachers to attend the week-long summer event.
* Since 1998, the &quot;Gettysburg Semester&quot;, a semester-long immersion in Civil War academic study has been offered.
* Gettysburg College students can elect to pursue a unique interdisciplinary minor in Civil War Era Studies. Requirements include a general introduction course about the Civil War and a capstone senior-level seminar. Students must also select four classes of at least two disciplines. Classes offered include military history, economics of the American South, Civil War literature, films about the Civil War, and gender ideology in the Civil War.
* The Lincoln Prize has been awarded annually since 1991 for the best non-fiction historical work on the Civil War.
* Starting in 2005, the Michael Shaara Prize has been awarded for excellence in Civil War fiction. Shaara was the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1974 novel about the Battle of Gettysburg, &quot;The Killer Angels.&quot;
* Author Mark Nesbitt&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts of Gettysburg: Spirits, Apparitions and Haunted Places of the Battlefield&quot; claims several sightings of paranormal activity on the campus, most notably in Pennsylvania Hall.

===Relationship with the Eisenhowers===

Early in his military career, Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie, lived in a house in Gettysburg that was across the street from the college (the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity House until 1955 on N. Washington Street). Both were fond of the town, so they decided to retire to a working farm adjacent to the battlefield after Eisenhower left the army. It was there that President Eisenhower recuperated from his 1955 heart attack.

While living in Gettysburg, Eisenhower became involved with Gettysburg College. He served on the Gettysburg College board of trustees, and he was given an office, which he used when writing his memoirs. Eisenhower&#x27;s old office is now named Eisenhower House and is occupied by the college&#x27;s office of admissions. Eisenhower&#x27;s grandson, David, and his granddaughter Susan continue a certain level of family involvement with the institution.

Today the Eisenhower Institute, a nationally recognized center for leadership and public policy based in Gettysburg and Washington, D.C., is formally recognized as a distinctive program of the college.

==Campus==

The college is located on a campus adjacent to the Gettysburg National Military Park. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, is from Harrisburg, from Baltimore, from Washington, D.C., from Philadelphia, from New York City, and from Boston.

The college&#x27;s main campus has over 90 buildings, many of which are historically relevant, and is roughly divided in half by Pennsylvania Hall (administration). The northern half contains Eddie Plank Gym, Masters Hall (physics and astronomy), Musselman Library, the College Union Building, the College Dining Center, Briedenbaugh Hall (English and Asian Studies), Weidensall Hall (History and Education), and several first-year residence halls and fraternities. A section of this part of campus known as &quot;Stine Lake&quot; is not actually a lake but rather a quad located outside of the library. Prior to the Musselman Library being built in the late 1970s, and due to Gettysburg&#x27;s wet climate and drainage issues, the quad and library site were prone to accumulating water, creating a large, muddy &quot;lake&quot; of sorts. Today, Stine Lake does not flood, but the name has stuck, to the confusion of first-year students. Additionally, the College Dining Center is known to students and faculty as &quot;Servo,&quot; after the now defunct 1980s food service company, Servomation.
The southern half of the main campus includes McKnight Hall (languages), Glatfelter Hall (computer science, management, political science, mathematics, and others), Schmucker Hall (art and music), Brua Hall, and several fraternities. Over the last half-century, the campus has expanded considerably to include land to the east of North Washington Street and to the west of the traditional campus. In that time, the campus has undergone many renovations, with buildings being added and removed.

Since approximately 96% of students live on campus, most of this additional land is dedicated to housing. It also includes the college chapel, the admissions building, a large gymnasium and field house complex, and several athletics fields. The college has also purchased or leased many buildings for student housing, including residences on Washington Street, Carlisle Street, Middle Street, and Stratton Street.

===The Majestic Theater===
In 1925, Henry Scharf built the Majestic Theater as an expansion to the historic Gettysburg Hotel, located in the center of town. Originally, the building featured a main room that seated 1,200 patrons. In the 1950s, performances in the Theater were attended by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, often with world leaders or visitors. When he was spending the night in his Gettysburg residence, President Eisenhower used the theater&#x27;s ballroom as an official White House Press Room for news conferences. The theater was also the location for the world premiere of the civil war epic Gettysburg (1993 film), produced by Ted Turner. In November 2005, the theater underwent a $20 million renovation process, with the main room being restored to its former glory and the addition of two new nightly cinemas. The theater is the location for the college&#x27;s Sunderman Conservatory of Music performances, as well as musical theater performances and outside guests. Many traditions and orientation events also occur in the building, which seats 816 individuals in a multi-level main room.

===Academic facilities===
====Library====
Musselman Library provides access to books, journals, videos, sound recordings, rare books, and manuscripts, many in online format. The online catalog is freely available and provides a description of the books, DVDs, and CDs in the collection. The journal locator provides a list of online and print journals in the collection. A list of the online databases is available on the library&#x27;s website. Exhibits are displayed throughout the library and are updated on a regular basis. The library maintains Gettysburg College&#x27;s institutional repository, The Cupola: Scholarship at Gettysburg College, a collection of scholarly and creative works produced by faculty, students, and other members of the Gettysburg College community.

Special Collections and College Archives, located on the fourth floor of the library, collects primary sources including rare books, manuscripts, maps, art works, sound recordings, photographs, and other materials which support the curriculum. Special Collections is also home to the College Archives, which preserves records that document college activities, policies, and programs. Rotating exhibits are on display in the Reading Room. Selected items and collections have been digitized and are available via GettDigital.

The building was designed by architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen, who intended the building to complement Glatfelter Hall (1889). Jacobsen referred to the architectural style as &quot;abstract Romanesque&quot;. The building project commenced thanks to a large gift from the Emma G. Musselman Foundation. Construction began in 1979 and the building opened on April 22, 1981. Books and other materials were transferred from Schmucker Memorial Library to Musselman Library via a human chain of students, faculty and others. In 1986, Jacobsen won both the Award for Excellence in Institutional Masonry Design and the Grand Award for Excellence in Masonry Design for his design of Musselman Library.

====Schmucker Hall====
Gettysburg College is a well respected institution for the musically inclined. The college is home to the Sunderman Conservatory of Music, which has performed regionally and internationally. Schmucker Hall houses four main classrooms, a 225-seat recital hall, a 10 station technology/piano lab, and 16 practice rooms. Two practice rooms are dedicated organ practice rooms, with a ratio of six students for one practice room. A recording studio is also found within the building&#x27;s walls. Choral assemblies usually perform in Christ Chapel, the campus&#x27; nondenominational structure that houses a variety of different ceremonies and seats 1,100 individuals.

====Glatfelter Hall====

Glatfelter Hall is one of the most iconic buildings on campus. Built in 1889 as the New Recitation Building, the deep red brick and gray stone building was rededicated in 1912 to honor Philip H. Glatfelter, a trustee and generous benefactor of the college. The building was built in the Romanesque Revival style, with a tower 143 feet high.

Currently, the building features four stories and a basement, with a grandiose main staircase traversing all but the top floor. The building houses the Anthropology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Political Science, Management, and Sociology departments, along with campus management resources. It is completely handicap accessible, with an elevator traversing all floors. The topmost section of the building contains offices, seminar areas, and a small student library, as well as the entrance to the belltower. Atop the tower, Glatfelter Hall&#x27;s bell can be heard across campus, ringing to mark the hour.

Renovations:
*In 1929 a thorough interior renovation was implemented, providing additional windows in the north and west facades.
*Between 1989 and 1991, a tower was added for an elevator and stairwell on the south façade and the buildings large attic was refurbished for academic use.
*Between 2013 and 2014, the interior was renovated consisting of waterproofing the foundation; the addition of a new classroom and seminar room on the ground floor; and mechanical, lighting, sprinklers, and design changed throughout the building.

====The Science Center====
The Science Center is part of a complex of two buildings. The Science Center is the newest building on campus being built in 2002. An building, the science center was designed to have first-rate scientific equipment, facilities, and resources, and has been continually renovated to include the most up to date material.

McCreary Hall is the other building in the complex, and is older but was renovated during the construction of the Science Center and in 2012. It is home to the Biology and Psychology departments, with the latest equipment including a vast deionized pure water system, infant research lab, space for cognitive neuroscience, and many animal facilities.

====Masters Hall====
Masters Hall is home to the physics department, and houses several specialized labs, the largest classroom on campus (Mara Auditorium), a machine shop, and a Physics student lounge. In addition, the building also includes an indoor planetarium, Hatter Planetarium which gives students glimpses of what the night sky will look like each month. It also has private shows for classes and performances on different, special topics. Some of the equipment available for student use and regularly used for professor&#x27;s research includes:
* Modernized telescopes and microscopes
* An advanced laser research lab used for investigating plasma and laser interactions; includes 25-milliwatt He-Ne laser, two 5 watt argon ion lasers, nitrogen dye laser, and other equipment
* Optical isolation table and optical tweezers
* Other technology relevant to specific classes and professors&#x27; research

The building houses astronomy classes and uses the campus&#x27; observatory, which is located just past the quarry. The observatory is used for undergraduate astronomical research and includes a 16-inch f/11 Ealing Cassegrain reflector, computer controlled. It also houses a classroom and six Meade telescopes. Since its construction in 1996, the observatory has been a huge benefit to astronomy students and has even made several star discoveries in the early 2000s. The Physics Department has supported Project CLEA for Astronomy.

====Brua Hall====
Brua Hall is the home of the college&#x27;s theater department. Kline Theatre is the building&#x27;s main attraction, seating 234 people with a thrust stage and an advanced sound and lighting system, including computer lighting memory control. The stage is home to many performances throughout the year, and is very often used by the theater department in addition to the student run theatre club, the Owl and Nightingale Society. Brua Hall also has a 48-seat blackbox, which with flexible playing space is constantly converted to fit the needs of the performance. The blackbox, Stevens Laboratory Theatre, is used for thesis productions from seniors as well as one-act plays written by students. The building has a fully equipped scene shop facility, studio and classroom space, dressing rooms, an Actors&#x27; Lounge and reception area known as Arms Green Room, and other storage and workroom areas.

Large-scale productions are generally performed in the Majestic Theater.

====Other buildings====
Economics and Africana studies are housed in a former house that was fully renovated in 2013, as well as in rooms in Glatfelter Hall.

Breidenbaugh Hall and Weidensall Hall are two adjacent buildings that house the English, Asian Studies, Civil War Era Studies, Classics, Education, Globalization Studies, History, Interdisciplinary Studies, Philosophy, and Religion departments. Weidensall Hall was originally built as a YMCA building, complete with a swimming pool, but was massively renovated in 1987. Both buildings feature a revived colonial design, with large columns supporting spacious porches.

====Technology====
Full network capabilities in all campus buildings and each residence hall room. Students have access to more than 1,300 computers and a complex system of workstations and laboratories. Wireless connectivity is available across 97% of the campus (the other 3% being the practice fields) and in all of the residence halls.

The school provides a large network of technological assistance, known as G-Tech, which is student staffed and IT supported. It offers free technical services including help with personal computers, removing adware or viruses, connecting to the college network, building computers, accessing school servers, and general troubleshooting assistance. The college&#x27;s network infrastructure has been consistently updated over the past decade to keep up with student demand and modernity. In addition, the technology department has deals for students and faculty to receive discounted personal computers and programs.

The campus welcomed Google in July 2012 to open the 225 acre campus to Google Streetview. Prospective students are able to walk through every inch of campus to see the facilities and fields.

==== The Center for Athletics, Recreation and Fitness ====
The college broke ground on the new $25 million athletic center, named the John F. Jaeger Center for Athletics, Recreation and Fitness, on May 30, 2008. The 55,000 foot Center is an upgrade from the former athletic facility, known as the Bream/Wright/Hauser Complex. Bream/Wright/Hauser still exists next to the additions. The Center opened in stages. A dedication ceremony on April 30, 2010, marked its completion. The center was officially named for the 1965 alumnus John F. Jaeger on May 4, 2012.

The Center features:
*A natatorium, complete with eight lanes, four warm-up lanes, and enough space for 350 seated spectators
* A 10,000 foot weight and cardio room complete with flat-screen TVs
*Additional spaces for yoga, aerobics, spinning and martial arts classes
*An upgraded training room with a Hydroworx pool
*Rock climbing walls
*A student lounge and dining space called &quot;The Dive&quot;

The center was created in order to provide more opportunities for the high percentage of students who like to maintain their fitness regimens and engage in intramural, club sports programs, and exercise classes. About 25 percent of the student body participate in varsity sports, while over 75 percent are active in intramural sports. More space was needed, and the center is important to improve life on campus.

John Jaeger, a 1965 Gettysburg College graduate, donated $1.2 million to encourage others to fund the project. Another important donor, Robert Ortenzio, provided the largest single gift by a living person in the history of the college, by giving $2 million.

===Campus safety===
Gettysburg College&#x27;s Department of Public Safety (DPS) is the primary agency responsible for the enforcement of college policies, security, and emergency response on the campus. Emergency medical services (EMS) are provided by Adams Regional EMS&#x27;s MICU 54–1 and Biglerville Fire Department&#x27;s MICU 6–1, when needed. The college falls under Gettysburg&#x27;s Volunteer Fire Department&#x27;s first-due response area.

==Academics and student life==
As an independent institution, the college operates under a charter granted in 1832 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The college is governed by a 39-member board of trustees comprising leaders from a range of professions and walks of life. Thirty of the college&#x27;s trustees are graduates of Gettysburg. Gettysburg is considered a more selective college, with admission rates recently hovering around 40%. The Class of 2022 had a 45.4% acceptance rate, and Gettysburg often competes with comparable schools Dickinson and Franklin &amp; Marshall for applicants. 83% of the class of 2022 was in the top 25% of their high schools, 62% of students were in the top 10% of their school.

Nearly 2,600 students, approximately one-half men and one-half women and representing 41 states, Washington, D.C., and 39 countries, attend the college. 75% of these students come from outside of Pennsylvania. Around 85% of the student body will graduate in five years, and almost 60% of graduates will study at least one semester abroad. The college has high retention rates, historically hovering around 90%.

The college employs 225 full-time faculty, with 100% of the permanent faculty holding a doctorate or highest earned degree in their fields. The student/faculty ratio is 10:1, with an average class size of 18 students. The college hosts one of only 19 chapters of Phi Beta Kappa in Pennsylvania, as well as 15 other academic honor societies in a variety of disciplines.

Gettysburg is known to be generous with financial aid, with over 70% of students receiving some form of aid. The Princeton Review has called Gettysburg a Best Value College, an award given to schools with exceptional financial aid systems and high rates of employment after graduation. 94% of alumni one year after graduation were either in graduate school or employed. This distinction is given to only 150 colleges in the United States, only 8 of which are in Pennsylvania. The Princeton Review has also called Gettysburg a College That Pays You Back, ranking the college 11th in Best Schools for Internships, one of only four liberal arts colleges to make the top 25.

===Academic programs===
Gettysburg College offers numerous fields of study and four possible degrees; Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Music Education.

In addition to its many majors and minors, the college offers several programs. Students may petition to design their own, individual, major. The major must consist of at least 17 courses, including a methods course and a 400-level capstone. Students design a curriculum of their own and choose a faculty advisor. During the senior year, the student takes a 400-level individualized study capstone which is the culmination of their program.

An engineering program is offered as a five-year, Dual Degree program in conjunction with Columbia University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, and University of Pittsburgh. Engineering students may choose any of these schools to travel to, taking three courses of liberal arts, mathematics, and physics at Gettysburg College, and two years of advanced engineering and physics classes at their chosen university. Upon completion of the program, students are awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree from Gettysburg College and a Bachelor of Science degree in an engineering discipline from one of the affiliated institutions.

The most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Econometrics &amp; Quantitative Economics (64)
::Political Science &amp; Government (64)
::Health Sciences (60)
::Business Administration &amp; Management (56)
::History (38)
::Experimental Psychology (35)
::Environmental Studies (34)
::Biology/Biological Sciences (33)

=== Sunderman Conservatory of Music ===
Music at Gettysburg College began in 1900 with a glee club and a guitar and mandolin club. It wasn&#x27;t until 1934 that music classes were first taught at Gettysburg College; Professor Frederick Shaffer taught music appreciation. The following year the college hired Parker Wagnild to direct a new choir open to both men and women. Wagnild would graduate from the Gettysburg Theological Seminary with a divinity degree in 1937, and would then be hired as an English professor by the college to continue directing the choir. After Wagnild received a master&#x27;s degree from New York University in 1948, a music department was established at Gettysburg College with Wagnild as the chair. He received an honorary doctorate of music from Thiel College in 1972, as well as an honorary doctorate of divinity from Gettysburg College.

Today, Gettysburg College is home to the Sunderman Conservatory of Music, which was established in 2006. Sunderman bequeathed $14 million, a large library of scores and parts, and a collection of 18th and 19th century violins and bows to Gettysburg College.

The Sunderman Conservatory of Music offers a Bachelor of Arts in music and a Bachelor of Music in Performance with tracks for Voice, Keyboard, Strings, and Winds/Percussion. The conservatory also offers a Bachelor of Music Education with students completing all requisite classes in seven semesters and teaching in their eighth.

Major ensembles include a Symphony Orchestra, a Wind Symphony and the College Choir. Students can also perform in the jazz band, jazz combo, as well as numerous chamber ensembles. The Bullets Marching Band, and ensemble of 100-120 student from within and outside the conservatory, performs every fall at home football games, and is routinely selected to perform as a part of the Collegiate Marching Band Festival in Allentown, PA. Students in these ensembles have opportunities to perform within the conservatory, throughout the college, and abroad with major ensembles touring nationally and internationally.

Performance venues for the Sunderman Conservatory include Paul Recital Hall in Schmucker Hall; Christ Chapel, the college&#x27;s center for religious and spiritual life; and the Majestic Theater, an 816-seat theater renovated in 2004–2005 that serves as the conservatory&#x27;s main performance venue.

===Greek organizations===
There are several fraternities and sororities on campus. Students can only rush as sophomores. Around 1/3 of all students are involved in some form of Greek life, and around 1/2 of eligible students are involved in Greek life.

===Student newspapers===
The Gettysburgian has been the school&#x27;s main student newspaper since 1897. Since 2012 the Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College has maintained a student newspaper, &quot;The Gettysburg Compiler,&quot; for publishing reports on the American Civil War, interviews with professionals in the field, and other developments in the study of the Civil War. The college has acknowledged and archived the newspaper, but refers to it as a &quot;scholarly blog.&quot; The newspaper is named after the historic Civil War era newspaper, &quot;The Compiler&quot;, which operated from 1866 until it shut down on July 1, 1961, under the name &quot;The Gettysburg Compiler.&quot;

==Activities and traditions==
The college boasts a wide variety of different events on campus, with an estimated 3,200 cultural events occurring during a four-year period.

===Activities===
There are more than 120 clubs and organizations on campus, focusing on areas of interest such as community service, art and music, theater and media, academics, student government, career fields, LGBTQA and outdoor adventure. These provide students with over 1,000 leadership opportunities each year, in addition to trips to surrounding metropolitan areas.

There are resources for Jewish, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, atheist, and Hindu students. The college provides nondenominational worship in the campus chapel and Glatfelter Lodge, and various resources for religious holidays.

====First Year Walk====
On November 19, 1863, students marched through town to the National Cemetery to hear President Abraham Lincoln deliver his now famous Gettysburg Address. In 2003, Peter Holloran, a Gettysburg graduate and marketing consultant to the college proposed recreating the walk to promote community among students and the town. The Orientation Chair at the time, Lindsay Morlock, saw the walk as an opportunity to encourage new students to step &quot;off campus from day one&quot; and &quot;acknowledge the history of Gettysburg College&quot;. Since the first walk on August 28, 2003, first year students have marched along the same one-mile path to be welcomed into town and hear the same words spoken over a century ago. Faculty, students, and townspeople cheer the arriving first-years along their walk as the main streets of town shut down to participate.

====Twilight hour====
Upon completion of the first semester, first-year students walk from the college union building to Pennsylvania Hall along paths illuminated by upperclassmen holding candles. Initially known as the Twilight Walk, the name was changed to Twilight Hour for the class of 2020 in 2017. The tradition is designed to welcome first-year students into alumni status, and involves the passing of a Class Book to the college president and the singing of the college&#x27;s alma mater. The tradition was discontinued in 2019 by the college&#x27;s Office of Student Activities and Greek Life.

====&quot;Servo Thanksgiving&quot;====
The week before Thanksgiving the dining center opens to serve a family-style traditional Thanksgiving meal. Students receive unlimited turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, pumpkin pie, and more, served by professors and administrators.

====Springfest====
On the weekend before finals, the college hosts a well-known musician who performs on the shores of Stine Lake.

==Athletics==
Twenty-four sports programs for both men and women participate in NCAA Division III. Gettysburg has earned the distinction of having the best win–loss record in the Centennial Conference for the past 14 years.

About a quarter of Gettysburg&#x27;s students participate in intercollegiate programs, which include twelve sports for men and twelve sports for women. Although the mascot for Gettysburg College is the Bullet, there is no official Bullet mascot at sporting events. In 2014, &quot;1000 to 1: The Cory Weissman Story&quot; was filmed at Gettysburg College. Cory Weissman was a student-athlete who had a stroke before his freshman basketball season.

In September, 2024 the school faced controversy as a black member of the men&#x27;s swimming team had a racial slur forcibly carved into his chest by a teammate.

<doc id="496693" wikidata="Q3566816" url="?curid=496693" title="Wayne Bennett (rugby league)">
<text>Wayne James Bennett (born 1 January 1950) is an Australian professional rugby league football coach and former player. He is currently the head coach of the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the NRL. He is widely regarded to as one of the greatest coaches of all time Bennett has previously coached the Dolphins, the South Sydney Rabbitohs, the Brisbane Broncos, the Newcastle Knights, the St George Illawarra Dragons, the Canberra Raiders, the Queensland Maroons State of Origin team, the NRL All Stars and the Australian Kangaroos national team as well as the England and Great Britain national teams.

Widely regarded as one of the sport&#x27;s greatest ever coaches. Bennett holds the Australian rugby league coaching record for the most grand final wins, winning seven premierships from ten grand final appearances in the NRL and its predecessors the Super League and New South Wales Rugby League, plus one premiership in the Brisbane Rugby League with Southern Suburbs in 1985. Bennett also holds the records for most seasons with a single club; twenty-four with the Brisbane Broncos, most games won as coach, and most games coached at over a thousand first-grade games, being recognised by the NRL in Round 10 of the 2023 season as having coached 900 games in the competition and its predecessors.

Additionally, he was a coaching adviser to the Tonga national rugby league team in 2022 and the assistant head coach of New Zealand in 2008.

As a player, Bennett was an Australian international and Queensland interstate representative or in the 1970s. He also played at club level with the Huddersfield Giants in England. Before becoming a full-time football coach in 1976, Bennett worked as a Queensland Police officer.

==Early life==
Bennett was born in the small township of Allora, Queensland, Australia. He grew up in a working-class family in nearby Warwick with an alcoholic father who deserted the family when Wayne was eleven years old, resulting in him entering the workforce at an early age. He has two sisters, Michelle and Gretta and two brothers, Robert and Dwight. Bennett is an avowed non-smoker, non-drinker and non-gambler. Before becoming involved with the Queensland Rugby League on a full-time basis, Bennett commenced work as a police officer at age fifteen while playing junior rugby league in Warwick. His family had ties to the police and rugby league in South East Queensland through his uncle, 1948 Kangaroo forward Eddie Brosnan.

==Playing career ==
Bennett&#x27;s playing career began with appearances for Warwick and Toowoomba in the South-West District Rugby League, and the All Whites in the Ipswich Rugby League. His first-grade appearances were for Past Brothers and Southern Suburbs in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership (BRL). He was a talented and goal-kicker, and represented Queensland nine times between 1971 and 1973, including seven games against New South Wales. Coached by Bob Bax, Bennett credits him as being a major influence in his own later coaching career. Bennett also played two tour matches for Australia on the 1971 tour of New Zealand. In 1972, Bennett played for Toowoomba in the last Bulimba Cup Final against Brisbane. After that, he played for Huddersfield in England alongside fellow Queenslander and future brother-in-law Greg Veivers. Bennett played for Brisbane&#x27;s Brothers club and under coach Paul Broughton reached the 1974 Grand Final which they lost to Fortitude Valley. Bennett was the top tryscorer in the 1975 Brisbane Rugby League season.

Bennett also played fullback for Brisbane Firsts, scoring a try in their 20–15 win over the touring Great Britain team in 1974 played in front of 7,880 fans at the Brisbane Showgrounds.

From 1975–77, Bennett coached the U18s Queensland Police Academy in the Brisbane local competition and the Police Academy Cadet Team versus the NSW Police Academy.

In 1976, he began full-time coaching in Ipswich, coaching three games for the midweek Amco and Carlton Cups, before moving to Brisbane Rugby League Premiership sides, Souths (who he captain-coached in 1977) and Brothers.

After the births of his three children, Bennett had a break from coaching. He returned in 1983 as coach of Souths Acacia Ridge under 16s as well as the Queensland Police Academy under 18s team which he took to a premiership. He also worked as the Police Academy&#x27;s fitness instructor. Bennett then took over the Souths job and took them to the 1984 grand final, which they lost to the Wynnum-Manly Seagulls. Revenge was to come a year later when the Bennett-coached Magpies defeated the Seagulls 10–8 in the BRL grand final to take the premiership. This was against a Seagulls line-up featuring Australian captain Wally Lewis and centre Gene Miles, both of whom would later captain the Brisbane Broncos under Bennett.

===Queensland Maroons ===
In 1986, Bennett took over from Des Morris as coach of the Queensland State of Origin team. The Maroons were beaten 3–0 in a series whitewash that year; however, Bennett was retained as Queensland&#x27;s coach for two more years.

===Canberra Raiders ===
In 1987, Bennett moved interstate to join the NSWRL&#x27;s Winfield Cup Premiership when he was appointed co-coach of the Canberra Raiders alongside then Australian team coach Don Furner. With the Queensland side, Bennett won the 1987 State of Origin series. By the end of the 1987 NSWRL season, he and Furner had guided the Raiders to their first Grand Final which was lost to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 18–8.

===Brisbane Broncos (1988–2008) ===
Bennett was appointed to be the first coach of the Brisbane Broncos when the club was formed in 1988. That season with the Maroons, he defeated New South Wales in a 3 nil whitewash in the State of Origin, but Bennett discontinued his representative coaching to focus on the Broncos.

Bennett&#x27;s reputation for being able to make tough and even unpopular decisions was characterised by his sacking of Wally Lewis as club captain in 1990. At the end of the season, Lewis was not made an offer large enough to retain him, with Bennett citing salary cap restrictions and the need to keep Sydney clubs away from more junior talent coming through. The Broncos won their first premierships in 1992 under Bennett. In the weeks following the grand final, Bennett travelled with the Broncos to England, where they played the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first NSWRL club to win the match in Britain. The following season, the Broncos again won the grand final, gaining a second consecutive premiership. During the 1994 QLDRL season, Bennett coached defending premiers Brisbane when they unsuccessfully hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge.

Bennett was appointed as Queensland coach again for the 1995 State of Origin series but pulled out of the position after players aligned with the breakaway Super League organisation (including the majority of his club team, the Brisbane Broncos) were refused selection. In the 1997 Super League season, the Broncos dominated under Bennett, winning the 1997 World Club Championship as well as the Telstra Cup grand final in Brisbane. Bennett resumed representative coaching duties in 1998 with Queensland and was also given the honour of coaching Australia when he was appointed to replace Bob Fulton as Kangaroos coach. Australia was undefeated in two test matches against New Zealand. Bennett won his fourth premiership with the Broncos when they took the 1998 NRL grand final, and he was also named Coach of the Year at the Queensland Sport Awards. Bennett ceased coaching the Australian national team in March 1999, and was replaced by Chris Anderson.

In 2000, Bennett won his fifth premiership with the Broncos. Following the premiership win, the Australian Rugby Union tried to poach Bennett, but he declined. Having won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos travelled to England to play against 2000&#x27;s Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with Bennett overseeing Brisbane&#x27;s loss. Bennett would again coach Queensland in 2001, gaining widespread attention after his decision to recall Allan Langer to the Maroons from the Super League for the deciding third game of the 2001 State of Origin series. Bennett remained Queensland&#x27;s coach for the 2002 and 2003 series before stepping down again. He continued his involvement with coaching for Queensland through the Queensland Academy of Sport and in an off-field role with the Queensland Rugby League. On Australia Day 2004, Bennett was honoured as a member of the Order of Australia &quot;for service to rugby league football, particularly as a coach, and to the community.&quot;

Bennett is a passionate advocate of international Rugby League and was instrumental in the revival of the Tri-Nations series in 2004. In that year, he was again appointed Australian coach and took Australia to reclaim the Trans-Tasman Trophy (lost to New Zealand in 2003) and win the second Rugby League Tri-Nations Series. At the end of the 2005 season, after five successive years without a grand final appearance, Bennett decided to have a clean-out of the coaching staff, removing such long-time allies as Gary Belcher, Glenn Lazarus and Kevin Walters.

That year, he received the Rugby League International Federation&#x27;s coach of the year award. However, on 9 December 2005, it was announced that Bennett had resigned as Australia&#x27;s coach after the Kangaroos lost an international series for the first time in 27 years, and equalled their biggest loss in 98 years, going down 24–0 to New Zealand in the final of the 2005 Tri-nations series. In 2006 a secret deal being brokered between Bennett and the Sydney Roosters club for him to become their coach was made public. This is said to have caused the deterioration in his relationship with the Broncos management which eventually led to his resignation. During the 2006 finals series, Bennett became the second person (after Tim Sheens) to coach 500 premiership games. He also signed on to continue coaching the Broncos for a further two years. The sixth premiership final won by Brisbane against Melbourne made Wayne Bennett the most successful Grand Final coach in history. He again was named Queensland&#x27;s Sport Coach of the Year for 2007 and was made a life member of the Broncos club. His refusal to make an acceptance speech at the club&#x27;s presentation ball showed the strain in his relationship with the Broncos. Bennett coached the 2007 All Golds. In doing so, he introduced the New Zealand players to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

Bennett was originally contracted to the Broncos until the end of 2009, but on the night of 4 February 2008 at a Broncos board meeting, he submitted his letter of resignation and sought an early release at the end of the 2008 season. Bennett&#x27;s coaching future was confirmed on 31 March 2008, when he signed a three-year contract to coach the St. George Illawarra Dragons from season 2009. After much speculation, Bennett became assistant coach and advisor to New Zealand coach Stephen Kearney in 2008. This was in preparation for the Centenary test against the Kangaroos. Bennett was retained in the same role for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, which the Kiwis won. Former New Zealand coach Graham Lowe has credited Bennett with the victory.

===St George Illawarra Dragons ===
The Bennett era at St George Illawarra began with high turnover of staff and players. High performance director Jeremy Hickmans, conditioner Scott Campbell and manager/assistant Paul Massey were recruited to replace the existing staff, while the playing roster had recently lost high-profile stars Mark Gasnier to retirement with Jason Ryles and Josh Morris released. The club&#x27;s player recruiting however was extensive: Jeremy Smith, Darius Boyd, Neville Costigan, Luke Priddis, Michael Weyman, Mathew Head (returned) and Mickey Paea. At the Dragons, Bennett was to be re-united with former Broncos Wendell Sailor and Luke Priddis, both of whom had won premierships with him at Brisbane. Neville Costigan, who also played under Bennett at the Broncos joined the Dragons that year in addition to Darius Boyd and Nick Emmett who also moved from Brisbane to St. George Illawarra at the same time as Bennett.

His first game with the Dragons was a golden point loss to the previous season&#x27;s grand finalists, Melbourne Storm. In round 4 of the 2009 NRL season, Bennett returned to Suncorp Stadium with the Dragons and for the first time coached against the club he helped build. St. George Illawarra defeated the Broncos convincingly as the Dragons continued to lead the competition in defence. However, after winning the minor premiership in his first season at the club, it was the Brisbane Broncos who knocked the Dragons out of finals contention at the end of the 2009 season.

In 2009, Bennett was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

In the 2010 NRL season, Bennett guided the Dragons to their second consecutive minor premiership and on to the 2010 NRL Grand Final, the joint venture club&#x27;s second. After years of having a &quot;choker&quot; tag, they faced the Sydney Roosters at ANZ Stadium in the decider at the season&#x27;s end. The rain fell across the ground during the match and Bennett&#x27;s players had a fiery 2nd Half after a traditional spray at half time as they were being led 8–6 at the break. The Dragons under Bennett were successful in winning their first premiership as a joint venture who went on to beat the Roosters 32–8.

The Dragons went on to defeat 2010&#x27;s Super League XV champions, Wigan Warriors in the 2011 World Club Challenge, but Bennett was absent, choosing to fly back to Australia days before the match to be with his ill mother-in-law, and leaving assistant coach Steve Price in charge.

On 30 March 2011, Bennett announced he would not continue on as coach of St George Illawarra beyond the 2011 season. His final game at the helm of St. George Illawarra ended the way it started, with a heartbreaking golden point loss against his old club, the Brisbane Broncos, at Suncorp Stadium. This extended Bennett&#x27;s winless finals record at the venue to eight.

===Newcastle Knights ===
In 2012, Bennett commenced a four-year contract with the Newcastle Knights. The team did not reach the finals that year; the first finals series not to feature Bennett in twenty-one years. This changed in the following season when he took the club to within one match of the 2013 NRL Grand Final.

Due to a change in club ownership in 2014, Bennett became a free agent and announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season to return to the Brisbane Broncos ahead of the 2015 season.

===Brisbane Broncos ===
Bennett returned to coach the Brisbane Broncos for the 2015 NRL season, The Broncos subsequently finished second in the regular season and made it to the grand final, but were defeated 17-16 by the North Queensland Cowboys in golden point extra time, which was the Broncos first grand final defeat. Bennett continued with the Broncos until the end of the 2018 season.

On 2 December 2018, Bennett was officially sacked as coach of the Brisbane Broncos following a bitter dispute with club officials. He then signed up to coach the South Sydney Rabbitohs for the 2019 season onwards. On 4 December 2018, Bennett spoke to the media about his sacking saying &quot;You don’t get the chance to say goodbye to anybody when they sack you and they tell you not to come back to the building&quot;, Bennett said. &quot;But that’s alright. That’s all fine. We’ll all get over it. I was happy to be sacked. Just leave it at that. I was happy&quot;.

===Great Britain and England ===
In 2016, Bennett was appointed coach of England for two seasons. The decision however suffered criticism from some critics, such as former English internationals Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock who believe previous coach Steve McNamara should have stayed at the helm, while Australian rugby league legend Wally Lewis said that an Australian should not be coaching the English team. Later in 2016, rumours came about that Bennett would be selecting Australian players such as Brett and twin brother Josh Morris as well as Trent Hodkinson in his English team for the 2016 Four Nations. However, he &#x27;denied&#x27; that he&#x27;d select those players in his squad saying that the media is &#x27;getting excited&#x27;. In October 2017, Bennett was selected for the England squad in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.

In 2019, Bennett was selected as head coach for the Great Britain Lions tour of the Southern Hemisphere. He took charge of Great Britain for the first time in the defeat by Tonga.
Great Britain ended the tour losing all four matches including the last match which was a humiliating 28–10 loss against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby. Following the conclusion of the tour, several Great Britain players and Bennett himself came under intense media scrutiny and fan backlash.

He was also selected to coach the England 9s squad for the 2019 Rugby League World Cup 9s.

===South Sydney Rabbitohs ===
In 2019, Bennett started his first of three seasons as South Sydney coach with the club winning ten of their first eleven games which saw them sitting at the top of the table. Following the 2019 State of Origin series, Souths suffered a slump in form before winning their last 3 matches in a row to finish the regular season in 3rd place. Bennett guided South Sydney to the preliminary final against the Canberra Raiders but were defeated 16–10 at Canberra Stadium.

On 21 February 2020, it was announced that Bennett would be leaving South Sydney as head coach at the end of the 2021 season with assistant Jason Demetriou taking his place. Nevertheless, Bennett guided South Sydney to a sixth place finish in the 2020 NRL season which saw the club qualify for the finals. Bennett took South Sydney to their third preliminary final in a row where they suffered a 20–16 loss against Penrith. On 14 January 2021, it was announced that Bennett relinquished his Queensland Maroons coaching job from the previous year. In the 2021 NRL season, Bennett guided South Sydney to a third placed finish. He then took South Sydney to the 2021 NRL Grand Final which was also Bennett&#x27;s tenth grand final as a head coach. South Sydney would go on to lose the final narrowly to Penrith 14–12.

===Dolphins ===

Commencing in 2022, Bennett joined the Dolphins as head coach for their inaugural 2023 season in the NRL competition. The Dolphins won their first three matches in 2023. In round 8, they equalled the greatest comeback in premiership history to defeat the Gold Coast Titans 28–26 at Suncorp Stadium, after trailing the Titans 26–0 after the first twenty-six minutes. The record for a winning comeback in premiership history dating to 1908 was set in 1998, when the North Queensland Cowboys went from being down 26–0 to defeating the Penrith Panthers 36–28 at full-time.

On 5 May 2023, it was reported that Bennett had coached a total of 1227 games to date, and the Dolphins&#x27; round 10 clash against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks on Saturday 6 May at Suncorp Stadium would be his 900th premiership match.

===South Sydney Rabbitohs ===
On 21 May 2024, Bennett signed a three-year deal to re-join South Sydney in 2025. It was also reported that Bennett had been approached by Parramatta to become their new head coach, however Bennett stated he had unfinished business at South Sydney saying &quot;I like the people there and I like the club and what it stands for&quot;.

==Public persona==
Known for his taciturn manner and appearing outwardly unemotional, Bennett has stated that he detests the media commitments required as head coach of a high-profile football team. Although on occasions he will happily give in-depth interviews, he has also exhibited hostility towards the press, avoided questions and started press conferences early.

==Personal life==
Bennett married Trish Veivers (a sister of Greg Veivers) in 1974, and they subsequently had three children. The couple separated in 2016.

In 2007, Bennett co-wrote the book &quot;Don&#x27;t Die with the Music in You&quot; with Australian journalist Steve Crawley. The title refers to a quote from the American intellectual Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. regarding failure to meet one&#x27;s potential. On 7 May 2008, prominent personalities such as NRL CEO David Gallop, rugby league coach Jack Gibson, businessman Lachlan Murdoch, entrepreneur John Singleton and cricketer Steve Waugh were among the attendees at the Australian Museum in Sydney when the book was publicly launched; it went on to sell over 100,000 copies. His second book with Crawley, &quot;The Man in the Mirror&quot;, was published in August 2009. Bennett has also written a weekly column in &quot;The Australian&quot;, a national newspaper.

In 2016, Bennett commenced a relationship with Dale Tynan, whom he met while coaching in Newcastle.

<text>The New Economic Policy (NEP) ( (DEB)) was a social re-engineering and affirmative action program formulated by the National Operations Council (NOC) in the aftermath of the 13 May Incident in Malaysia. This policy was adopted in 1971 for a period of 20 years and it was succeeded by the National Development Policy (NDP) in 1991.

==Policy overview==
The New Economic Policy (NEP) which began with the Second Malaysia Plan (1971–1975) and lasted until the Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986–1990), had three main objectives, namely:
* To achieve national unity, harmony and integrity
* Through socio-economic restructuring (of the society)
* To minimize the level of poverty in the country (poverty eradication)

The NEP was conceived as a two-pronged strategy for eradicating poverty for all Malaysians as well as reducing and subsequently eliminating identification of race by economic function and geographical location. The policy sought to achieve its objectives through rapid expansion of the economy over time and set its target of substantially reducing the incidence of absolute poverty by 1990. To achieve this, the policy called for aggressive improvement of economic status and quality of life for all Malaysians through:
* Access to land
* Physical capital
* Training
* Public facilities

Concurrently, the policy also called for fairer distribution of opportunities to participate in the widening range of economic activities. The policy opined that the core problem that stood in the way of national unity was the division of racial groups by economic function; particularly the association of Malay and other indigenous races with subsistence agriculture. To dissociate Malay and other indigenous races with traditional agriculture, the policy called on the Malaysian Government to provide assistance to all Malaysians in:
* Finding employment
* Securing participation in economic activities
* Acquiring ownership in various economic sectors

As Malay and other indigenous races progressed in the modern economic sector, other Malaysians were encouraged to introduce modern agriculture to eliminate the identification of Malay and other indigenous races with subsistence agriculture.

The overarching principle of the policy was the creation of &quot;a socio-economic environment in which individual Malaysians find self-fulfilment within a system which provides for proportional participation, management and control in the economic life of the nation&quot;.

==Policy development context==

===Colonial period===
During British colonial rule in Malaya, the Malays had always been in close contact with British officials by virtue of being the subjects of the Sultans. Administratively, Malays displayed a highly structured system, which enabled the British to embed themselves into the existing structure with ease. To communicate effectively with the Malay Rulers, Malays were employed by the British to work in Resident&#x27;s Offices as clerical staff. However, Malays were mostly educated in Islamic madrasah, with little exposure to Western education. To ensure a competent administrative workforce, the British established Malay schools to teach to basic clerical knowledge.

The discovery of tin in Malaya in 1820s led to an influx of Chinese miners. This discovery led to disputes among the Malay Rulers, Chinese miners, affluent chieftains and villagers, resulting in formal British colonial rule in 1874. By 1885, Malaya became the largest tin producer in the world, accounting for 55% of global tin output. The prosperity brought about by tin mining was primarily shared between the British and the Chinese. As mining towns grew larger and became more economically important, urban infrastructure improved and these mining towns became the seat of administrative power for the British and traditional Malay capitals became insignificant.

In 1839, the vulcanisation technique was discovered by Charles Goodyear, which marked the beginning of the extensive use of rubber in industry. In Malaya, Henry Nicholas Ridley, Director of Singapore and Penang Botanical Gardens, introduced rubber plantations in the early 1890s when he convinced the Kinderly Brothers of Inch Kenneth Estate in Selangor and a Chinese tapioca planter, Tan Chay Yan in Malacca to adopt rubber plantations as a commercial enterprise. By 1911, labour imported from India involved in the rubber plantation sector totaled 126,665 people and Malaya became the world&#x27;s largest producer of natural rubber. Educated Indians were employed in the estates&#x27; hospitals and clinics while the majority worked as rubber tappers.

===Malaya&#x27;s economy pre- and post-independence===
Before independence in 1957, Malaya&#x27;s economy was recovering from the destruction brought about by World War II, entailing huge reconstruction costs to the British colonisers. As the British sought to consolidate Malaya&#x27;s economic policy between the Malay States, the Malayan Union was proposed to unify the Federated and Unfederated Malay States into a single entity. This proposal was met with objection from the Malay community as they were angered by the way in which the Malay Rulers&#x27; assent was sought. Furthermore, there were concerns about citizenship and economic policies if the proposed union were to materialise.

After a short period of union, the British dissolved the Malayan Union and replaced it with the Federation of Malaya, with Tunku Abdul Rahman as its first Chief Minister. By that time, rubber and tin were the main source of income for the federation and it was one of the more prosperous economies in the region. Its per capita income was ranked third in Asia, after Japan and Singapore.

British corporations dominated the lucrative rubber industry and large tracts of land were dominated by British corporations such as Dunlop Plantation, Guthrie Plantation and Harrisons &amp; Crossfield. However, the British agricultural policy during that period discouraged the participation of indigenous communities in the export crop economy, despite interest in smallholding rubber plantations. This development left the indigenous population in subsistence agriculture producing largely for domestic production and consumption, while the British and other communities expanded their interest in commercial agricultural production and dominated the export crop economy.

After independence, the Federation of Malaya government pursued a diversification policy to promote other economic activities. The government also acknowledged that dependency on rubber and tin as the main contributors to the national income could not be immediately reduced. The poverty rate up to 1970 was high at 49%, with the indigenous communities holding less than 3% of the national economy.

===Racial riots of 1969===

The racial riots of 1969 occurred against the backdrop of high poverty rates among the indigenous population and was compounded by communal political tension. Perceptions among the communities persisted and helped fuel mistrust, especially between the Malay and Chinese communities. At the more affluent neighbourhood of Petaling Jaya, it was evident that people with similar socioeconomic status were the least affected by the riots.

The precursor to the racial riots of 1969 occurred in Singapore in 1964, which led to the expulsion of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia. The People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), Malaysia&#x27;s main opposition party, called for equality for all Malaysians and challenged the domination of the ruling Alliance Party coalition in the federal election of 1964. This was known as the &#x27;Malaysian Malaysia&#x27; campaign. As communal tension threatened to turn violent, the federal government decided to expel Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia.

===Suspension of Parliament and formulation of the New Economic Policy===
In the wake of the riots, the government declared a state of national emergency and Parliament was suspended. A caretaker government, the National Operations Council (NOC), was formed and chaired by Tun Abdul Razak. After restoring order and setting the constitutional framework, the New Economic Policy was announced in the Second Malaysia Plan. The socio-political justification for NEP was:

==Policy benchmarks==
The NEP had the stated goal of poverty eradication and economic restructuring to eliminate the identification of ethnicity with economic function. The initial target was to move the ratio of economic ownership in Malaysia from a 2.4:33:63 ratio of Bumiputra, Other Malaysian, Foreigner ownership to a 30:40:30 ratio. This was to be done by redistributing the wealth to increase the ownership of enterprise by Bumiputra from a 2.4% to 30% of the share of national wealth. The 30% target for Bumiputra equity was proposed by Ismail Abdul Rahman after the government was unable to come to a consensus on an appropriate policy goal.

Alongside this redistribution of wealth was the goal of increased economic growth. This economic growth would allow the non-Bumiputra share of the economy to decrease, while permitting the growth of non-Bumiputra business interests in absolute terms. In some quarters, this was referred to as &quot;expanding pie theory&quot;: the Bumiputra share of the pie would increase, without reducing the size of the non-Bumiputra slices of the pie. This theory was first enunciated in the Second Malaysia Plan.

In 1975 the government created incentives to expand large-scale manufacturing industries and energy-intensive industries, targeting these industries and building policies around them. The Heavy Industries Corporation of Malaysia (HICOM), for example, was formed to assist in the manufacture of pig-iron, aluminium die casting, pulp and paper, steel, cement, motorcycle and heavy engineering. At the same time, export incentives were initiated.

==Implementation==
The abstract policies and goals of the NEP were implemented by the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Malaysia Plans.

Some specific requirements were introduced to achieve the 30% Bumiputra equity target set by the NEP. Among these was a requirement that all initial public offerings (IPOs) set aside a 30% share for Bumiputra investors. These investors could be selected by the company being listed on the stock exchange, or the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which would normally recommend such state-owned trust agencies as Permodalan Nasional or the Armed Forces pension fund. These shares were initially heavily discounted, as IPO prices were often significantly lower than prices after the listing had taken place. However, this advantage has disappeared in recent years. Nevertheless, this regulation has been criticised, especially as the 30% target continues to apply after the IPO has occurred; if the Bumiputra investors divest their shares, the company must issue new shares to maintain the proportion of Bumiputra shares above 30%.

==Results==
Wealth in the hands of the bumiputras went from 4% in 1970 to about 20% in 1997. The overall wealth of the country grew; per capita GNP went from RM1,142 in 1970 to RM12,102 in 1997. During the same period, absolute poverty in the population as a whole dropped from 50% to 6.8%. It is unclear what role the NEP played in these changes.

The effects of the NEP on wealth distribution are disputed. The Gini index declined from 51.3 in 1970 to 44.6 in 1997, and 1987 figures indicated the mean income of the Malays had improved relative to both the Chinese and Indian communities. However, some have used 1997 statistics with 70.2 percent of households in the bottom 40 percent income group as Bumiputra, and 62.7 percent of households in the top 20 percent income bracket as non-Bumiputra, to argue that inequities remain. The Gini index also began to increase in the 1990s, going from 44.6 to 46.4 between 1990 and 1995; meanwhile, 1997 figures indicated that Chinese incomes were increasing at a rate double that of Malays&#x27;. Intra-ethnic income differences also increased markedly, especially among Malays.

Bumiputra participation in the professions and private sector increased as well, although Bumiputra remain somewhat under-represented. Between 1970 and 1990, the Bumiputra share of accountants doubled from 7 to 14 per cent, engineers from 7 to 35 per cent, doctors from 4 per cent to 28 per cent, and architects from 4 to 24 per cent. The Bumiputra portion of the share market – a figure frequently cited as &quot;a measurement of overall community wealth&quot;, despite claims that it was misleading – increased from 2 to 20 per cent over the same period according to one academic&#x27;s measurements. The Chinese share also increased from 37 to 46 per cent, at the expense of foreign participation. Official Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange figures from 1998 were even more optimistic, indicating Bumiputra share ownership stood at 28.6% in 1990 and 36.7% in 1996.

The Chinese community in Malaysia accepted the NEP as a necessary evil to avoid Indonesian-style aggression, which the ruling party consistently instigate and deemed appropriate as their threat based policy. Furthermore, the Chinese community generally moved away from the public sector and set up businesses in the private sector, where the impact of the NEP was less pronounced.

In spite of the policies implemented under the NEP, the share of the national wealth owned by the non-Bumiputra races increased beyond the 40% mark. This figure, however, does not reflect that certain parts of the non-bumiputra population live in dire poverty. The Malaysian Indian and Orang Asli in particular form the lowest strata of the population in terms of economic ownership. The Orang Asli of Peninsular Malaysia are not considered Bumiputra under the Federal Constitution despite their indigenous status.

==Reimplementation==
Officially the term of the NEP ended in 1990. However, much of it remained in effect through other governmental policies; the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; reported that this was because as of 2007, &quot;the government believes the aim of having 30 per cent Bumiputera equity has yet to be achieved&quot;. In 2006, it was reported that the NEP would be reinstated under the Ninth Malaysia Plan, the ninth in a series of five-year economic plans. Originally, the NEP was replaced by the National Development Policy (NDP), which ran from 1990 to 2000. The NDP was supposed to have then been replaced by the National Vision Policy (NVP), which would reportedly have lessened the aggressive affirmative action of the NEP and NDP. However, UMNO later called for the NEP to be reinstated.

==Criticism==
In recent years, the NEP has come under attack as being an inefficient system that promotes a laid-back attitude among the Bumiputra ; it is racial-based and not deprivation based. Several policies of the NEP which give economic advantage to the rich Bumiputra, such as Bumiputra quotas in ownership of public company stock, and housing being sold exclusively to Bumiputra, are viewed as discriminatory.

Many of the NEP policies strive for equality of results rather than equality of opportunity, with NEP proponents justifying the concentration on results rather than opportunity as by pointing out that measuring equality of opportunity is difficult or impossible. When the NEP was implemented, for example, it was announced that one of its goals was to have 30% of all equity in Bumiputra hands.

NEP critics have argued that setting a target of 30% of Bumiputra trained and certified to run companies would represent a better equality in terms of opportunity. Still others suggest this target may not work as training and certification does not necessarily guarantee equality of opportunity. Tun Abdul Razak&#x27;s predecessor as prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, also opposed the 30% target, writing in the 1980s that &quot;[a]n attempt was made to fill the target without thought for the ability and the capability of attaining it. ... Some became rich overnight while others became despicable Ali Babas and the country suffered economic setbacks&quot;.

The NEP is also criticised for not dealing directly with issues of wealth distribution and economic inequality; that it no longer helps the poor but is instead an institutionalised system of handouts for the largest ethnic community in Malaysia as the NEP does not discriminate based on economic class. Bumiputra of high and low economic standing are entitled to the same benefits. The statistical problems of categorising wealthy and disadvantaged Bumiputra in one group also meant that the NEP&#x27;s goal of having 30% of the national wealth held by Bumiputra was not indicative of a median 60% of Bumiputra holding 28% of the national wealth, but could theoretically translate into one Bumiputra holding 29% of the national wealth, with the remaining Bumiputra sharing 1%. Some have alleged that because of this imbalance, some Malays remain economically marginalised. Criticisms also arose from the fact that there was no planned assistance for Malaysian Chinese and Indian communities to achieve their 40% goal during the actual implementation of the NEP.

The manufacturing sector is exempted from the Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) Guidelines, the 30 per cent Bumiputera equity and restrictions in market entry have been removed for all sub-sectors.

=== Education ===
The education policy of the NEP is one of the plan&#x27;s more controversial points.

Bumiputra were accorded quotas for admission to public universities until 2002. These quotas were fixed, however, and in later years meant that the Bumiputra were allotted a significantly lower percentage of places originally intended, as the population figures used to calculate the quotas were based on 1970s numbers. Despite this, the quotas were still considered by many non-Bumiputra as unfairly rewarding the Bumiputra. The government removed these quotas in 2003.

The removal of the quotas has done little to remedy the perceptions of Bumiputra bias in the public tertiary education system. Most Bumiputra opt to enter a one-year matriculation programme, which is considered by some to be less intensive than the two-year &quot;Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia&quot; (STPM) or Malaysian High Certificate of Education, which is equivalent to the British A-levels. Although the &#x27;grade&#x27; standards required for admission are the same for both programmes, there is no moderation to ensure the difficulty of achieving a grade standard is the same between both programmes. The Malaysian High Certificate of Education (STPM) is open to all races, but the Matriculation programme has a 10% quota for non-Bumiputra (meaning that 90% of students admitted must be Bumiputra). In practice significantly more Bumiputra enter the matriculation program, even after normalising for ethnic demographics.

These differences predate the removal of hard quotas. The difference in academic routes in fact begins in secondary school. Many Bumiputra enter public boarding secondary schools (&quot;sekolah asrama&quot;) whereas most non-Bumiputra remain in normal public secondary schools. The exams taken are the same until form 5 but then most Bumiputra go on to matriculation, whereas non-Bumiputra do STPM. However, even Bumiputra who remain in &#x27;normal&#x27; secondary schools usually do matriculation instead of STPM. The lack of public transparency in grading of the papers contributed to this criticism.

The removal of quotas was largely reported to have resulted in an increase in the percentage of Bumiputra entering public universities. The perceived bias towards Bumiputra has meant that non-Bumiputra who can afford to do so choose to enter private colleges or to go overseas to further their education. There is a significant proportion of non-Bumiputra who do not enter into contention for admission to public universities.

Critics argue that this policy of the NEP has also contributed to a brain drain. Others suggest that the NEP has contributed to racial polarisation and a feeling of marginalisation among the non-Malays.

However, as of 2007, Chinese Malaysians dominate the professions of accountants, architects and engineers while Indian Malaysians dominate the professions of veterinarians, doctors, lawyers and dentists well exceeding their respective population ratios compared to Bumiputra. 

=== Changing mindsets ===
Some Bumiputra have spoken of reducing or eliminating the NEP; for example, Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Prime Minister of Malaysia, in his maiden speech as United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) president to the UMNO general assembly in 2004 stated &quot;Let&#x27;s not use the crutches for support all the time, the knee will become weak&quot;. Badawi went on to state that continued usage of crutches would eventually result in needing a wheelchair instead. As of October 2004, Badawi has not addressed any significant concerns about the NEP.

Not all Bumiputra political leaders shared Badawi&#x27;s views. For example, Badruddin Amiruldin, who was elected as UMNO&#x27;s Deputy Permanent chairman, waved a book about the 13 May incident at the assembly during his speech while declaring, &quot;No other race has the right to question our privileges, our religion and our leader&quot;, continuing that any such action would be akin to &quot;stirring up a hornet&#x27;s nest&quot;. The following day, Dr. Pirdaus Ismail, a UMNO Youth Executive Committee member, stated, &quot;Badruddin did not pose the question to all Chinese in the country. Those who are with us, who hold the same understanding as we do, were not our target. In defending Malay rights, we direct our voice at those who question them.&quot;

Agreement on the continued implementation (or reimplementation) is not always unanimous within the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition. In 2005, Khairy Jamaluddin, the UMNO deputy youth chief was debated by then MCA (the major Chinese component party of the ruling Barisan Nasional) vice-president Chua Jui Meng on a nationally televised debate – both leaders agreed to Chua&#x27;s proposal to set up a national committee to review the NEP. However, as of 8 March 2008 general elections, this has yet to be implemented.

Because of the controversy over affirmative action policies in Malaysia, especially the NEP, it has been feared that the NEP may indirectly contribute to a decrease in foreign investment. In 2005, foreign investment fell by US$4 billion, or 14% which some commentators attributed to the controversy over the government&#x27;s ethnic policies.

===Equity calculation===
The calculation of Bumiputra-held economic equity has been frequently disputed, with a number of allegations that the government intentionally underestimated the share of Bumiputra equity to justify the NEP and its related policies. Although many affirmative action measures of the NEP were continued under the National Development Policy which ran from 1990 to 2000, and later by the National Vision Policy set to run from 2000 to 2010 – leading many Malaysians to refer to the NEP in the present tense – the official Bumiputra equity share remained under the original 30% target.

In 2006, a major dispute arose when the Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) issued a report calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% – a stark difference from the official figure of 18.9%. The report&#x27;s publication triggered a relatively vocal public debate about the status of the NEP and its related policies, with many from UMNO questioning the methodology used by ASLI. One strongly disputed issue was ASLI&#x27;s decision to consider government-linked companies as Bumiputra-owned, inflating the calculated figure of Bumiputra equity. Although ASLI later withdrew the report, citing unspecified errors in its methodology, the debate did not die down. One political analyst suggested that &quot;If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely the next question is, why the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present.&quot; Others have argued that the debate over inter-ethnic disparities has obscured intra-ethnic inequities, citing the increased Gini coefficient for Bumiputra (from 0.433 in 1999 to 0.452 in 2004), Chinese (0.434 to 0.446) and Indians (0.413 to 0.425).

A major point of dispute was the government&#x27;s use of par value (as opposed to market value) of shares to calculate the equity held by Bumiputra. Many questioned the ASLI study on the basis that it had not used par value; conversely, others criticise the government for not using market value. On another note, some critics later noted that a 1997 University of Malaya study had calculated the Bumiputra share of equity to stand at 33.7%, using par value.

UMNO critics contend that the official figure does not take into account the huge volume of shares, amounting to 7.9 percent in 1999, that is held by nominee companies. Independent studies have revealed that politicians and political parties, including UMNO, have resorted to using nominee companies to conceal their ownership of corporate equity from public scrutiny. Also, branded conglomerates like Proton and Petronas are not regarded by the government as &quot;Bumiputra&quot; companies. This approach tends to exaggerate non-Malay purchasing power. It is also not clear if the government calculations included the 2.7 million unincorporated businesses in the country.

At the UMNO General Assembly that year, Education Minister and UMNO Youth Chief Hishamuddin Hussein quoted a local study indicating that at current rates, it would take the Malays &quot;120 years to achieve income parity&quot;. He also cited a 2004 statistic indicating that for every RM 1 earned by a Malay, a Chinese earned RM 1.64 as evidence that the income gap had not been eliminated. The Deputy Youth Chief, Khairy Jamaluddin, proposed increasing the target &quot;quota&quot; if non-Malays continued to allege that the 30% target had been met, as &quot;By any yardstick, the Malays are still left behind&quot;.

=== Brain drain ===
Many non-Malays (Chinese and Indians) have left Malaysia for other developed countries that do not practice policies that favor one race over the others in political, economical, and social contexts. This is believed to have led to the shortage of skilled workers, that directly caused the inability of Malaysia to pursue rapid economic development during the early 1960s until 1990s, during which the East Asian Tigers have done so.

==Recent developments==

===NEP for the southern Thailand Muslims===
The chief minister of Malaysia&#x27;s Kelantan State also PAS (Islamic Party of Malaysia) spiritual leader Nik Aziz said that Thailand should consider introducing an affirmative action policy like Malaysia&#x27;s to narrow the social and economic gap between the Muslims and non-Muslims and to put a plug to the surging violence in southern Thailand. 
===Polls===
71% of Malaysians agree with the statement that Barisan Nasional&#x27;s &quot;race-based affirmative action policy is obsolete and must be replaced with a merit-based policy&quot;, the survey poll was conducted by the independent Merdeka Centre between 18 June 2008 and 29 July 2008, the result showed that up to 65 per cent of Malays who were asked the question agreed that race-based affirmative action should be done away, compared with 83 per cent of Chinese and 89 per cent of Indian respondents.

===Najib ready to end special privileges for Malays===

In October 2008, the deputy prime minister Najib Razak said &quot;if we do not change, the people will change us&quot;. &quot;In the not-too-distant future, we will see all the elements of the New Economic Policy being replaced.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a huge challenge,&quot; &quot;There must be this political will and desire to change within UMNO. I don&#x27;t think we can expect people to look at us in more favourable terms unless we change, unless we rectify our weaknesses.&quot;

<doc id="496696" wikidata="Q27075339" url="?curid=496696" title="Wilson's bird-of-paradise">
<text>Wilson&#x27;s bird-of-paradise (Diphyllodes respublica) is a species of passerine bird of the family Paradisaeidae.

The first footage of the Wilson&#x27;s bird-of-paradise ever to be filmed was recorded in 1996 by David Attenborough for the BBC documentary &quot;Attenborough in Paradise&quot;. He did so by dropping leaves on the forest floor, which irritated the bird into clearing them away.

==Nomenclature==
The controversial scientific name &quot;respublica&quot; of this species was given by Charles Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon&#x27;s nephew and a republican idealist. The habit of zoologists at that time to dedicate newly discovered species to some king, queen, or aristocrat deeply irritated him. In order to assert his convictions, he chose to name this species &quot;respublica&quot; to honour the republic and not the royalty.

Charles Lucien Bonaparte described the bird from a badly damaged trade specimen purchased by British ornithologist Edward Wilson. In doing so, he beat John Cassin, who wanted to name the bird in honour of Wilson, by several months. Thirteen years later, in 1863, the German zoologist Heinrich Agathon Bernstein discovered the home grounds of the Wilson&#x27;s bird-of-paradise on Waigeo Island. 

==Distribution==
An Indonesian endemic, the Wilson&#x27;s bird-of-paradise is distributed to the hill and lowland rainforests of Waigeo and Batanta Islands off West Papua.

Due to ongoing habitat loss, limited range, and exploitation, the Wilson&#x27;s bird-of-paradise is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

==Habitat==
Its preferred habitat is the hill forest at 300 m of altitude, more rarely the lowland rainforest and the middle mountain forest.

==Description==
Wilson&#x27;s bird-of-paradise is rather small. Males can reach a length of (21 cm including central rectrices) and a weight of 53–67 g., while females can reach a length of 16 cm, but a weight of 52–60 g. The male is a red and black bird-of-paradise, with a yellow mantle on its neck, light green mouth, rich blue feet, and two curved violet tail feathers. The head is naked blue, with a black double cross pattern on it. The female is a brownish bird with a bare blue crown.

In the field, the blue bare skin on the crown of the bird&#x27;s head is so vivid that it is clearly visible by night; the deep scarlet back and velvet green breast are lush, the curlicue tail gleaming bright silver.

==Diet==
Their diet consists of fruits, insects, arthropods, and other small invertebrates.

== Rituals of seduction ==
Males of these birds clear an area of rainforest to create a &#x27;display court&#x27;. Then they perform an elaborate mating dance to impress a potential mate. The male usually exhibits an attractive breast shield and accompanies the mating dance with song and calls.

== Courtship behavior ==
Male Wilson’s birds-of-paradise are the most colorful of all the species within the family, possessing a veritable rainbow of color. This remarkable example of hue and iridescence possesses all of the primary colors (and more) in different ways. The baby blue hue of its head is skin, not feathers, and is the result of structural color absent in any other member of birds-of-paradise. Yellow on the nape of its neck, followed by the crimson on its back are consistent, pigmented colors, present year-round. Its quirky, &quot;handlebar-mustache-shaped&quot; tail feathers are brilliantly iridescent, reflecting light to produce intense color to the eye of the beholder.

The sexual dimorphism of the species leaves the female very drab in comparison. Sexual dimorphism, or the difference in physical appearance between the sexes, is the result of female selection, in which females select males based upon indirect genetic benefits which increase offspring fitness. Because this species is polygynous, where one male mates with multiple females, the female is left on her own to raise young, forcing her to assess these indirect genetic benefits through courtship rituals, details of which are in the following section.

Dance

While these birds are difficult to locate in the wild and have not been studied in-depth, footage of the few mating rituals that have been witnessed for this species tells all. This species territorially defends a &quot;court&quot; in which it performs its vocalizations and physical maneuvers. Males will continually work to keep this area free of debris, making sure that nothing on the ground will distract from their displays. Males will perch on a vertical branch in the middle of their court, flexing their brilliant green fluorescent collar and calling out to females to attract them to their site. Females who are interested will perch above the male on the branch and watch as he weaves back and forth, calling to her and flexing the fluorescent collar. As was recently discovered when researchers filmed the dance from the female&#x27;s perspective, as the male displays, he is basically a brilliant green disc, and the inside of his mouth is fluorescent, making him an astonishing beacon of brilliant color. This phenomenal display of color demonstrates the power of female sexual selection over male appearance and behavior in the animal kingdom.

<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Japanese garrison commander on Wake Island during World War II, and a convicted war criminal. He was responsible for ordering the Wake Island massacre, in which 98 American civilians were murdered by Japanese soldiers. Following Japan&#x27;s surrender, Sakaibara was tried for war crimes and executed for his involvement.

==Biography==
A native of Yamagata prefecture in northern Japan, Sakaibara was a graduate of the 46th class of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1918, placing 36th in a class of 124. He served his midshipman tour on the cruiser &quot;Tokiwa&quot;, and after his commission as an ensign, was assigned to &quot;Hirado&quot;. He later served on the destroyer &quot;Kaba&quot; and battleship &quot;Mutsu&quot;.

As a sub-lieutenant, he served on the &quot;Iwate&quot; and after his promotion to lieutenant on December 1, 1924, he was assigned to the &quot;Hiei&quot;, &quot;Yura&quot;, and &quot;Sendai&quot;. He was chief gunnery officer on the &quot;Tatsuta&quot;. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1930, he served as chief gunnery officer on &quot;Takao&quot; in 1934, followed by &quot;Mutsu&quot; in 1935. He was executive officer on &quot;Chikuma&quot; in 1939. After his promotion to captain in 1940, he served in a number of staff positions.

After the Battle of Wake Island on December 23, 1941, Sakaibara was appointed the garrison commander of the Japanese occupation force. Fearing an imminent attempt by American forces to retake the island, Sakaibara put 98 American civilians they had captured to work building a series of bunkers and fortifications in preparation for a suspected amphibious invasion.

On October 5, 1943, aircraft from USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; bombed Wake Island. Two days later, Sakaibara ordered the beheading of an American civilian worker who was caught stealing. Fearing an invasion, Sakaibara ordered the rest of them to be killed. They were taken to the northern end of the island, blindfolded and machine-gunned. One prisoner (whose name has never been discovered) escaped, carved a message into a rock about the incident but was then recaptured and personally beheaded by Sakaibara.

However, despite the massive assembly, the attack never came. Instead the United States Navy established a submarine blockade, causing the Japanese garrison to starve. United States forces bombed the island periodically from 1942 until Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945.

Sakaibara was promoted to rear admiral a year later, on October 15, 1944. The Japanese garrison on Wake Island formally surrendered to the United States on September 4, 1945.

After the war, Sakaibara, his subordinate, Lieutenant Commander Shoichi Tachibana, and Toraji Ito, were taken into custody by the American occupation authorities. They initially claimed that the victims were killed in a bombing raid by U.S. forces, but later confessed to the massacre.

Sakaibara, Tachibana, and Ito were extradited to Kwajalein Island, where they were tried for war crimes by a U.S. military commission. Ito killed himself in custody. Sakaibara and Tachibana were both found guilty and sentenced to death in December 1945. Tachibana&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life in prison, and he was sent to Sugamo Prison to serve out his sentence. Sakaibara was extradited to Guam for execution.

Just before he was sentenced, Sakaibara read out a final statement to the commission. He admitted that what he did was wrong and said he wished that he had never heard of Wake Island. However, Sakaibara also claimed that the United States had no moral authority to try him or others after using nuclear weapons on Japan. With that statement, many people in Sakaibara&#x27;s hometown saw him as a victim of victor&#x27;s justice.

Sakaibara was hanged in Guam on June 19, 1947. Until the end, he maintained, &quot;I think my trial was entirely unfair and the proceeding unfair, and the sentence too harsh, but I obey with pleasure.&quot;

<doc id="496699" wikidata="Q139188" url="?curid=496699" title="Elevon">
<text>Elevons or tailerons are aircraft control surfaces that combine the functions of the elevator (used for pitch control) and the aileron (used for roll control), hence the name. They are frequently used on tailless aircraft such as flying wings. An elevon that is not part of the main wing, but instead is a separate tail surface, is a stabilator (but stabilators are also used for pitch control only, with no roll function, as on the Piper Cherokee series of aircraft). 

Elevons are installed on each side of the aircraft at the trailing edge of the wing. When moved in the same direction (up or down) they will cause a pitching force (nose up or nose down) to be applied to the airframe. When moved differentially, (one up, one down) they will cause a rolling force to be applied. These forces may be applied simultaneously by appropriate positioning of the elevons e.g. one wing&#x27;s elevons completely down and the other wing&#x27;s elevons partly down.

An aircraft with elevons is controlled as though the pilot still has separate aileron and elevator surfaces at their disposal, controlled by the yoke or stick. The inputs of the two controls are mixed either mechanically or electronically to provide the appropriate position for each elevon.

==Applications==
===Operational aircraft===
One of the first operational aircraft to utilise elevons was the Avro Vulcan, a strategic bomber operated by the Royal Air Force&#x27;s V-force. The original production variant of the Vulcan, designated as the &quot;B.1&quot;, did not have any elevons present; instead, it used an arrangement of four inboard elevators and four outboard ailerons along its delta wing for flight control. The Vulcan received elevons on its extensively redesigned second variant, the &quot;B.2&quot;&#x27;; all of the elevators and ailerons were deleted in favour of eight elevons. When flown at slow speeds, the elevons operated in close conjunction with the aircraft&#x27;s six electrically-actuated three-position airbrakes.

Another early aircraft to use elevons was the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, an interceptor operated by the United States Air Force. A few years after the F-102&#x27;s introduction, Convair built the B-58 Hustler, an early supersonic bomber, which was also equipped with elevons.
Perhaps the most iconic aircraft fitted with elevons was the Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde, a British–French supersonic passenger airliner. In addition to the requirement to maintain precise directional control while flying at supersonic speeds, designers were also confronted by the need to appropriately address the substantial forces that were applied to the aircraft during banks and turns, which caused twisting and distortions of the aircraft&#x27;s structure. The solution applied for both of these issues was via management of the elevons; specifically, as the aircraft speed varied, the active ratio between the inboard and outboard elevons was adjusted considerably. Only the innermost elevons, which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings, would be active while Concorde was flown at high speeds.

The Space Shuttle Orbiter was furnished with elevons, although these were only operable during atmospheric flight, which would be encountered during the vehicle&#x27;s controlled descent back to Earth. There were a total of four elevons affixed to the trailing edges of its delta wing. While flown outside of atmospheric flight, the Shuttle&#x27;s attitude control was instead provided by the Reaction Control System (RCS), which consisted of 44 compact liquid-fueled rocket thrusters controlled via a sophisticated fly-by-wire flight control system.

The Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, a large flying wing operated by the United States Air Force as a strategic stealth bomber, also used elevons in its control system. Northrop had opted to control the aircraft via a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust after assessing various different means of exercising directional control with minimal infringement on the aircraft&#x27;s radar profile. Four pairs of control surfaces are positioned along the trailing edge of the wing&#x27;s; while most surfaces are used throughout the aircraft&#x27;s flight envelope, the inner elevons are normally only ever applied while being flown at slow speeds, such as on approach to landing. To avoid potential contact damage during takeoff and to provide a nose-down pitching attitude, all of the elevons remain drooped during takeoff until a high enough airspeed has been attained. The B-2&#x27;s flight surfaces are automatically adjusted and repositioned without pilot input to do so, these changes being commanded by the aircraft&#x27;s complex quadruplex computer-controlled fly-by-wire flight control system in order to counteract the inherent instability of the flying wing configuration.

===Research programmes===

Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of aircraft flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons and flaps into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. However, the main drawback is that when the elevons move up in unison to raise the pitch of the aircraft, generating additional lift, they reduce the camber, or downward curvature of the wing. Camber is desirable when generating high levels of lift, and so elevons reduce the maximum lift and efficiency of a wing. These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sixth generation fighter aircraft. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics.

In flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing is a NASA effort. The Adaptive Compliant Wing is a military and commercial effort.

In fluidics, forces in vehicles occur via circulation control, in which larger more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller simpler fluidic systems (slots which emit air flows) where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. In this use, fluidics promises lower mass and costs (as little as half), very low inertia and response times, and simplicity.

<doc id="496707" wikidata="Q544464" url="?curid=496707" title="Angus King">
<text>Angus Stanley King Jr. (born March 31, 1944) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the junior United States senator from Maine since 2013. A political independent, he served as the 72nd governor of Maine from 1995 to 2003.

Born and raised in Virginia, King moved to Maine after graduating from law school. In 1989, he founded Northeast Energy Management, Inc., a company that developed and operated electrical energy conservation projects. He won the 1994 Maine gubernatorial election as the independent candidate in a four-way race and was reelected in a landslide in 1998. As the country&#x27;s only independent governor, King enjoyed high approval ratings during his tenure. After leaving office in 2003, King returned to his business career.

King won Maine&#x27;s 2012 Senate election to replace the retiring Republican Olympia Snowe and took office on January 3, 2013. He was reelected to a second term in 2018, following the state&#x27;s inaugural instant-runoff voting elections, and won a third term in 2024 against Republican nominee Demi Kouzounas and Democratic nominee David Costello. For committee assignment purposes, he caucuses with the Democratic Party. He is one of two independents in the Senate; the other is Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also caucuses with the Democrats.
==Early life, education, and early career==
King was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the son of Ellen Archer (née Ticer) and Angus Stanley King, a lawyer. His father was a U.S. magistrate for the Eastern District of Virginia.

King graduated from Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria. He then enrolled at Dartmouth College, where earned a B.A. in 1966. At Dartmouth, King joined the Delta Upsilon social fraternity. He then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, graduating in 1969.

Soon after graduating from law school, King entered private law practice in Brunswick, Maine. He was a staff attorney for Pine Tree Legal Assistance in Skowhegan.

In 1972, he served as the chief counsel to the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Narcotics. King served as a legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator William Hathaway in the 1970s. He was also well-known statewide as a host on public television.

In 1973, when he was 29, King was diagnosed with an aggressive form of malignant melanoma. King has said he believes he survived cancer only because he had health insurance, and has highlighted this experience when explaining his support for the Affordable Care Act.

In 1975, King returned to Maine to practice with Smith, Loyd and King in Brunswick. In 1983, he was appointed vice president of Swift River/Hafslund Company, which developed alternative energy (hydroelectric and biomass) projects in New England.

In 1989, King founded Northeast Energy Management, Inc., a company that developed and operated electrical energy conservation projects. In 1994, he sold the company. As of 2012, King&#x27;s investments were valued at between $4.8 million and $22.5 million.

==Governor of Maine (1995–2003)==

In May 1993, King announced he would run for governor of Maine as an independent in the 1994 election. Incumbent Governor John McKernan, a Republican, was term-limited and could not seek another term. King abandoned his lifelong affiliation with the Maine Democratic Party. &quot;The Democratic Party as an institution has become too much the party that is looking for something from government&quot;, King told the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot; a few weeks after he announced his candidacy. The Republican nominee was Susan Collins, Commissioner of Professional and Financial Regulation under Governor John McKernan and a protégée of U.S. Senator William Cohen, and at the time relatively unknown to the electorate. The Democratic nominee was former Governor and U.S. Representative Joseph E. Brennan. It was Brennan&#x27;s fifth campaign for governor.

The general election was a highly competitive four-way race between King, Collins, Brennan, and Green Party nominee Jonathan Carter. King invested early in television advertising during Maine&#x27;s unusually early June primary, allowing him to emerge from the primary season on an equal footing with his rivals. He positioned himself as a businessman and a pragmatic environmentalist focused on job creation and education. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; described King as an idealist who &quot;wants to slash regulations but preserve the environment; hold the line on taxes; impose work and education requirements on welfare recipients; experiment with public school choice and cut at least $60 million from the state budget.&quot; His opponents criticized him for flip-flopping. Collins argued King &quot;presents different images, depending on who he is talking to. Angus has been a Democrat his whole life. In my opinion, he became an independent because he didn&#x27;t think he could beat Joe Brennan in a primary. He&#x27;s extremely smooth, articulate and bright, but he says different things to different groups.&quot;

King narrowly won the November 8 election with 35% of the vote to Brennan&#x27;s 34%, a margin of 7,878 votes. Collins received 23% of the vote and Carter 6%. King won eight counties, Collins five and Brennan three. King&#x27;s election as an independent was preceded by fellow independent James B. Longley, elected to the same office 20 years earlier.

During his tenure, King was the only U.S. governor unaffiliated with a political party. He was also one of only two governors nationwide not affiliated with either of the two major parties, the other being Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who was elected in 1998 as a member of the Reform Party. The terms of Connecticut&#x27;s independent governor Lowell Weicker and Alaska&#x27;s independent governor Walter J. Hickel both ended when King&#x27;s began. In his 2004 book &quot;Independent Nation&quot;, political analyst John Avlon describes all four governors as radical centrist thinkers. As governor, King signed legislation requiring that all school employees be fingerprinted and undergo background checks.

King had an approval rating of 75% going into his reelection bid in 1998, which he easily won, garnering 59% of the vote and defeating Republican Jim Longley Jr. (the son of the former governor), who took 19%, and Democrat Thomas Connolly, who received 12%. King&#x27;s 59% was the highest share of the vote a gubernatorial candidate had received since Brennan&#x27;s 1982 reelection with 62%. Brennan&#x27;s 1982 victory was also the last time until 1998 that a gubernatorial candidate had won a majority of the vote, and King&#x27;s 1998 reelection was the last time a Maine gubernatorial candidate received the majority of the vote until 2018.

In 2002, King launched the Maine Learning Technology Initiative (MLTI) to provide laptops for every public middle-school student in the state, the first initiative of its kind in the nation. It met with considerable resistance due to its cost but was enacted by the Maine Legislature. On September 5, 2002, the state began the program with a four-year $37.2-million contract with Apple Inc. to equip all 7th- and 8th-grade students and teachers in the state with laptops.

==Hiatus from politics (2003–2012)==
The day after he left office in 2003, King, his wife, Mary Herman, and their two children, who were 12 and 9 at the time, embarked on a road trip in a 40 foot (12m) motor home to see America. Over the next six months, the family traveled and visited 33 states before returning home in June 2003.

During his post-gubernatorial residency in Maine, he lectured at Bowdoin College in Brunswick and Bates College in Lewiston. He was appointed a visiting lecturer at Bowdoin in 2004 and an endowed lecturer at Bates in 2009, teaching courses in American politics and political leadership at both institutions.

In 2007, King and Rob Gardiner, formerly of the Maine Public Broadcasting Network, formed Independence Wind, a wind energy company. In August 2009, Independence Wind along with joint venture partner Wagner Forest Management won Maine DEP approval for construction of a proposed $120-million, 22-turbine, utility-scale wind power project along a prominent mountain ridge in Roxbury, Maine. To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, King sold his share of the company after entering the 2012 U.S. Senate election. Of the project, King has said, &quot;People who say wind is only an intermittent resource are looking for a one-shot solution. And my experience is that there are rarely silver bullets, but there is often silver buckshot. Wind is an adjunct source of energy. Ten percent, 20% can be very significant&quot;.

==U.S. Senate (2013–present)==

===Elections===

==== 2012 ====

On March 5, 2012, King announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Olympia Snowe. King said &quot;hogwash&quot; to allegations by some Republicans that he had cut a deal with Democrats to keep U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree out of the race.

King&#x27;s Senate campaign came under scrutiny for posting a heavily edited newspaper profile of him on its website.

On November 6, 2012, King won the Senate race with 53% of the vote, beating Democrat Cynthia Dill and Republican Charlie Summers. The following week, King announced that he would caucus with Senate Democrats, explaining not only that it made more sense to affiliate with the party that had a clear majority, but that he would have been largely excluded from the committee process had he not caucused with a party. King said he had not ruled out caucusing with the Republicans if they took control of the Senate in 2014 United States Senate elections, but when Republicans did win the majority that year, he remained in the Democratic caucus. King remained in the Democratic caucus after the 2016, 2018, and the 2020 elections, the first two of which also resulted in Republican Senate majorities and the last of which produced a 50–50 tie.

==== 2018 ====

On November 6, 2018, King was reelected, defeating Republican state Senator Eric Brakey and Democrat Zak Ringelstein.

==== 2024 ====
On November 5, 2024, King was reelected to a third term, defeating Republican Demi Kouzounas, Democrat David Costello, and independent Jason Cherry. Should he serve until his 81st birthday on March 31, 2025, he will become the oldest U.S. senator in Maine history.

===Tenure===

==== 113th Congress (2013–2015) ====

King supported reform of the Senate filibuster, noting that senators are no longer required to stand on the floor and speak during a filibuster. He also pointed out that the Constitution contains no 60-vote requirement to conduct business in the Senate. In 2013, King voted in favor of the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster for most presidential nominees.

King opposed attempts by the U.S. House to cut $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over 10 years, fearing that it &quot;would affect people in a serious way&quot; and drive more people to soup kitchens and food banks. He supported the more modest Senate efforts to save $4 billion over the same period by closing loopholes.

In 2014, King was chosen for the annual tradition of reading George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address to the Senate.

King endorsed his colleague Susan Collins for reelection in the 2014 U.S. Senate election, calling her a &quot;model Senator&quot;. At the same time, he endorsed Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire for reelection. King also endorsed Eliot Cutler for governor in the 2014 election, as he had in 2010, but on October 29, 2014, he switched his endorsement to Democratic nominee Mike Michaud. He also endorsed Democrat Emily Cain for the Maine&#x27;s second congressional district election and Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee in his reelection campaign.

After Republicans gained the Senate majority in the 2014 election, King announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats. He cited his belief that it is good for a state to have a senator from each party, and that it is important to have a senator who caucuses with the same party as the President, saying, &quot;In the end, who I caucus with is less important than who I work with.&quot; He added, &quot;It does not mean I have become a Democrat. It does not mean I have made a promise to anybody.&quot;

==== 116th Congress (2019–2021) ====
In 2020, President Donald Trump said King was &quot;worse than any Democrat&quot; after King had a &quot;testy&quot; exchange with Vice President Mike Pence in a phone call in which King had criticized the executive branch&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. King stated he had &quot;never been so mad about a phone call in my entire life,&quot; after the phone call with Pence. He also called the President and Vice President&#x27;s response to the pandemic &quot;a dereliction of duty.&quot;

==== 117th Congress (2021–2023) ====
King was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. When they breached the Capitol, King and other senators were moved to a safe location. He called the event a &quot;violent insurrection&quot; and &quot;unspeakably sad&quot;, and blamed Trump. In the wake of the attack, King announced that he supported invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office.

==== 118th Congress (2023–2025) ====
King was one of 19 votes in favor of a bill to block arms sales to Israel during the Israel–Hamas war. King, who had skipped an address to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in protest of Israel&#x27;s conduct of the war earlier that year, said that the war had taken &quot;a dark turn when it resulted in far more casualties among innocent Palestinians—including tens of thousands of women and children—than among Hamas.&quot;

* Affordable College Textbook Act (S. 1864; 115th Congress)
* In April 2023, it was revealed that Justice Clarence Thomas had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of travel and free gifts from a Republican donor. King and Senator Lisa Murkowski introduced a bipartisan bill intended to force the Supreme Court to establish an ethics code that would require the court to appoint an official to examine public complaints and potential conflicts.

==Political positions==
King has been described as a moderate Independent. He has called himself &quot;neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but an American&quot;. The nonpartisan &quot;National Journal&quot; gave him a 2013 composite ideology score of 59% liberal and 41% conservative. His Crowdpac score is −4.3 (10 is the most conservative, −10 the most liberal), based on a data aggregation of his campaign contributions, votes, and speeches. In a study published by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called &quot;Party Unity scores,&quot; King voted with the Democratic Party 43% of the time. GovTrack ranks King among the more moderate members of the Senate, near the Senate&#x27;s ideological center. In 2014, King endorsed his Republican colleague from Maine, Susan Collins. According to FiveThirtyEight, which tracks Congressional votes, King had voted in line with President Trump&#x27;s position on legislation about 38% of the time as of January 2021. In 2023, the Lugar Center ranked King in the top fifth of senators for bipartisanship.

=== Agriculture ===
In August 2018, King was one of 31 senators to vote against the Protect Interstate Commerce Act of 2018, a proposed amendment to the 2018 United States farm bill that would mandate states to authorize agricultural product sales not prohibited under federal law. After the farm bill passed in December, King and Susan Collins released a statement expressing their delight at the amendment not being included as there were a &quot;number of state laws in Maine that would have been undermined if this amendment was adopted, including those on crate bans for livestock, consumer protections for blueberry inspections, and environmental safeguards for cranberry cultivation&quot;.

===Economic policy===
King has called for the continuation of a tariff on imported athletic footwear, citing the potential loss of jobs at New Balance&#x27;s Skowhegan and Madison factories in Maine. Also while governor, King vetoed a bill that would have raised Maine&#x27;s minimum wage by 25 cents per hour.

In 2017, King opposed the Republican tax bill, criticizing its passage on a party-line vote without hearings, saying: &quot;The Bangor City Council would not amend the leash law using this process.&quot; King criticized the legislation for adding $1 trillion to the U.S. budget deficit over ten years and sought to return the bill to committee, but his proposal failed on a party-line vote.

In March 2018, King and fellow Maine senator Susan Collins introduced the Northern Border Regional Commission Reauthorization Act, a bill that would bolster the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) and was included in the 2018 United States farm bill. In June 2019, when King and Collins announced the NBRC would award grant funding to the University of Maine, the senators called the funding an investment in Maine&#x27;s forest economy that would &quot;help those who have relied on this crucial sector for generations&quot; and &quot;bolster efforts by UMaine to open more opportunities in rural communities.&quot;

On April 15, 2020, the Trump administration invited King to join a bipartisan task force on the reopening of the economy amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

King is supportive of U.S. manufacturers like Auburn Manufacturing, a Maine company he visited in 2022 to promote domestic manufacturing and speak out against Chinese unfair trade practices.

====Minimum wage and Social Security ====
On March 5, 2021, King voted against Bernie Sanders&#x27;s amendment to include a $15/hour minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

King and a group of Republican senators led by Bill Cassidy proposed a bill that included raising the Social Security retirement age from 67 to 70. Other policy proposals included tweaking the benefits formula to take into account the number of years a person has worked, and expanding the program&#x27;s ability to invest in private stocks, rather than the current trust fund model.

====Trade====
In February 2019, during ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, King was one of ten senators to sign a bipartisan letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Energy Secretary Rick Perry asserting that the American government &quot;should consider a ban on the use of Huawei inverters in the United States and work with state and local regulators to raise awareness and mitigate potential threats&quot; and urging them &quot;to work with all federal, state and local regulators, as well as the hundreds of independent power producers and electricity distributors nationwide to ensure our systems are protected.&quot;

===Environment and energy===
King supports action to combat climate change and carries a laminated graph of increases in carbon dioxide in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to respond to climate change denialists. He was the only member of Congress to join a three-day U.S. Coast Guard fact-finding mission to Greenland in 2016, where he witnessed melting ice sheets firsthand and said that the impacts of climate change were &quot;amazing and scary&quot;. Nevertheless, in March 2019 King joined Senate Republicans in voting against the Green New Deal.

King opposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the grounds that the amount of oil is not worth the environmental risk of extracting it. He also believes that new developments in the energy field, such as fracking, should be subject to &quot;all appropriate environmental safeguards to protect the American people and the American land.&quot; King opposes the Keystone XL pipeline, saying it &quot;will facilitate the transport of some of the world&#x27;s dirtiest and most climate-harming oil through our country&quot;, and has cast several votes against legislation authorizing its construction. King said he was &quot;frustrated&quot; with President Obama&#x27;s delay in deciding whether to authorize construction, but that he opposed Congress legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project.

King has expressed opposition to the creation of a Maine Woods National Park. His 2012 campaign website said that local control is the best way to conserve land, but in 2014, King said he was keeping an open mind about the idea.

King initially expressed &quot;serious reservations&quot; about proposals to establish the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, but expressed support for Obama&#x27;s creation of the monument in 2016, saying that the administration had made commitments that convinced him that &quot;the benefits of the designation will far outweigh any detriment&quot;; that the monument would not hurt Maine&#x27;s pulp and paper industry; and that the monument would help diversify the local economy.

King opposes efforts in Maine to ban the baiting and trapping of bears, including an effort to put the question to voters in 2014, calling such practices necessary to prevent interaction between bears and people, and saying the practices are based on science and the views of experts.

In 2017, King and Senator Jim Risch introduced the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the bill in 2018. The bill creates a pilot program for the federal government to study analog, nondigital, and physical systems that can be incorporated into the power grid to mitigate the potential effects of a cyberattack. The idea for the bill came after a 2015 cyberattack in Ukraine took down a large portion of the country&#x27;s energy grid. In April 2019 King was one of four senators caucusing with the Democrats who voted with Republicans to confirm David Bernhardt, an oil executive, as Secretary of the Interior Department.

In April 2019, King was one of 12 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to top senators on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development advocating that the Energy Department be granted maximum funding for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), arguing that American job growth could be stimulated by investment in capturing carbon emissions and expressing disagreement with President Trump&#x27;s 2020 budget request to combine the two federal programs that do carbon capture research.

In July 2019, King called climate change &quot;one of the most serious threats to&quot; the United States, saying that two thirds of Arctic ice has disappeared over the past 30 years. A release from King&#x27;s office stated that he had asserted the vital need for the U.S. to return to the aspirations of the Paris Climate Accord.

===Foreign relations and national security===
King has voted to arm Syrian rebels who were fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ISIL militants.

King favors the normalization of U.S.–Cuba relations. He opposes the U.S. embargo against Cuba, calling it an &quot;antiquated&quot; relic of the Cold War; in 2015, King introduced legislation to lift the embargo.

As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, King participated in its probe of Russia&#x27;s interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. King said that the entire committee had &quot;no doubt whatsoever&quot; about the Kremlin&#x27;s culpability in the meddling and described the cyberattacks as &quot;a frontal assault on our democracy&quot; that could present a long-term threat.

In May 2018, King and fellow Maine senator Susan Collins introduced the PRINT Act, a bill that would halt collections of countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties on Canadian newsprint and require the U.S. Department of Commerce to conduct a study of economic health of printing and publishing industries. Proponents of the bill argued it would offer a lifeline to the publishing industry amid newsprint price increases. Critics accused it of setting &quot;a dangerous precedent for future investigations into allegations of unfair trade practices.&quot;

In August 2018, King and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China&#x27;s Xinjiang region. They wrote: &quot;The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in &quot;political reeducation&quot; centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response.&quot;

In November 2018, King joined Senators Chris Coons, Marco Rubio and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in sending the Trump administration a letter raising concerns about the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s undue influence on media outlets and academic institutions in the United States. They wrote: &quot;In American news outlets, Beijing has used financial ties to suppress negative information about the CCP. ... Beijing has also sought to use relationships with American academic institutions and student groups to shape public discourse.&quot;

In late 2018, King voted to withdraw U.S. military aid for Saudi Arabia&#x27;s war in Yemen.

In December 2018, after President Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from Syria, King was one of six senators to sign a letter expressing concern about the move and their belief &quot;that such action at this time is a premature and costly mistake that not only threatens the safety and security of the United States, but also emboldens ISIS, Bashar al-Assad, Iran, and Russia.&quot;

In October 2019, King was one of six senators to sign a bipartisan letter to Trump calling on him to &quot;urge Turkey to end their offensive [in Syria] and find a way to a peaceful resolution while supporting our Kurdish partners to ensure regional stability&quot; and arguing that to leave Syria without installing protections for American allies would endanger both them and the U.S.

King initially rejected calls for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war, but as the war progressed, he became increasingly critical of Israel&#x27;s conduct. He skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s address to a joint session of Congress in 2024 due to Israel&#x27;s conduct in the war, and in December 2024 joined 18 other senators mostly from the Democratic Party&#x27;s progressive wing in voting to block arms sales to Israel due to the number of Palestinian civilians killed in the conflict.

In March 2023, King voted with a bipartisan majority to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) in Iraq.

==== Iran ====
In 2015, King supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an international agreement with Iran. In voting against a &quot;resolution of disapproval&quot; in opposition to the agreement, King stated, &quot;The current alternatives, if this agreement is rejected, are either unrealistic or downright dangerous.&quot;

In May 2019, King said he believed U.S. intel on Iran was accurate but that he wanted to know which country was reacting to the actions of the other, adding that he was &quot;gravely concerned because of the possibility of miscalculation, misunderstanding, misreading of some event and all of the sudden you&#x27;re on the ladder of escalation that could be dangerous for this country and for the Middle East.&quot;

After President Trump halted retaliatory air strikes against Iran after Iran downed an American surveillance drone in June 2019, King said he agreed with the decision not to carry out the strikes but expressed concern about Trump&#x27;s potentially limited options after steps taken by National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. King also questioned the difference in U.S. relations with Iran that year as opposed to any other in the country&#x27;s history and asserted that it was &quot;a high-stakes gamble&quot; if the U.S.&#x27;s pressure on Iran was unsuccessful.

===Gun laws===
King supports expanding background checks to most firearms transactions, with exceptions for transfers between family members, calling such a position &quot;the single most effective step&quot; that can be taken to keep guns out of the wrong hands. He supports limiting the size of magazines to 10 rounds, and to make purchasing a gun for someone not legally allowed to have one a federal crime. He does not support a ban on assault weapons, believing it will not work and that such a ban is not based on the functionality of the weapons, which are not relevantly different from the many hunting rifles owned by Maine residents. He noted that the vast majority of gun crimes are committed with handguns, not rifles.

King voted for the Manchin–Toomey amendment to expand background checks for gun purchases.

In 2018, King was a cosponsor of the NICS Denial Notification Act, legislation developed in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that would require federal authorities to inform states within a day after a person failing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System attempted to buy a firearm.

In August 2019, after two mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, King cosponsored the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, a bill authorizing states to use grants to develop red flag laws which would allow family members to petition courts for an order that would temporarily prevent someone from purchasing a gun and an order for law enforcement to take a firearm away.

In 2022, King voted for the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a gun reform bill introduced following a deadly school shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. The bill enhanced background checks for firearm purchasers under the age of 21, provided funding for school-based mental health services, and partially closed the gun show loophole and boyfriend loophole.

After the 2023 Lewiston shootings, King joined fellow Maine Senator Susan Collins in opposing calls for a national assault weapons ban but supporting bans on functionalities such as high-capacity magazines.

===Healthcare===
King supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare), but has expressed support for modest adjustments to the legislation if they can be done on a bipartisan basis. In 2013, he voted to restore funding for the ACA as part of an amendment to legislation that funded government operations for 45 days. He has said that those opposed to the ACA who are attempting to discourage people from purchasing health insurance are &quot;guilty of murder&quot; and that doing so was &quot;one of the grossest violations of our humanity that I could think of.&quot; In making this comment, King noted a time in his life when he believed he would have died had he not just acquired health insurance.

In 2015, as part of the Obama administration&#x27;s fiscal year 2016 budget, the United States Department of Veteran Affairs proposed congressional authorization for $6.8 million toward leasing 56,600 square feet at an unspecified location in Portland, Maine, to expand a clinic that would authorize southern Maine veterans to receive basic medical and mental health care locally. King supported the proposal. He and Susan Collins released a statement that ensuring Maine veterans had access to high quality care &quot;is one of our top priorities, and we&#x27;re pursuing the input of local veterans and interested stakeholders to understand their perspective about the proposal.&quot;

In January 2017, King voted against the Republican Senate budget plan to accelerate repeal of the ACA and block repeal legislation from being filibustered; the measure passed on a largely party line 51–48 vote. He spoke out against the House Republican repeal legislation, noting that the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 14 million Americans would lose health insurance if the legislation were enacted. Of the House Republican bill, King said, &quot;If you were designing a bill to hammer my state, it would be this bill,&quot; adding that it would most adversely affect Maine residents between the ages of 50 and 65.

King is a supporter of the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) program.

King favors abortion rights.

In February 2017, King and 30 other senators signed a letter to Kaléo Pharmaceuticals in response to an increase of the opioid-overdose-reversing device Evzio&#x27;s price from $690 in 2014 to $4,500. They requested the detailed price structure for Evzio, the number of devices Kaléo Pharmaceuticals set aside for donation, and the totality of federal reimbursements Evzio received in the previous year.

King criticized Trump&#x27;s 2017 budget proposal for its cuts to medical research. In 2018 he voted with all Republicans except Rand Paul and six Democrats to confirm Alex Azar, Trump&#x27;s nominee for Health Secretary.

In June 2018, King and fellow Maine Senator Susan Collins released a statement endorsing a proposal by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai intended to boost funding for the Rural Health Care Program of the Universal Service Fund, writing that &quot;with demand for RHC funding continuing to rise, any further inaction would risk leaving rural healthcare practitioners without lifesaving telemedicine services. This long-overdue funding increase would be a boon to both healthcare providers and patients in rural communities across our country.&quot;

In July 2019, King was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA), a bill intended to strengthen training for new and existing physicians, people who teach palliative care, and other providers who are on palliative care teams that grant patients and their families a voice in their care and treatment goals.

In October 2019, King was one of 27 senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it &quot;would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.&quot;

King has voted against Republican attempts to completely defund Planned Parenthood, calling the proposals an &quot;unfounded yet relentless assault&quot; and &quot;another example of misguided outrage that would only hurt those who need help the most.&quot; No federal funds go to Planned Parenthood for abortions (federal dollars pay for other health care services provided by the group, such as contraception and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases), but Republicans have sought to completely defund the organization because it provides abortions with other funds. King stated that supporters of the bill were in effect voting to deprive low-income Americans of healthcare over an issue &quot;that has nothing to do with the 97 percent of the services that Planned Parenthood provides,&quot; saying: &quot;To me, this bill is like attacking Brazil after Pearl Harbor.&quot;

===Immigration===
King strongly criticized President Donald Trump&#x27;s Executive Order 13769, which barred the admission of refugees to the U.S. and barred travel by nationals of several Muslim-majority countries to the country. He said: &quot;This is probably the worst foreign policy decision since the invasion of Iraq. What it&#x27;s done is played right into ISIS&#x27;s hands. They want us to turn this into a war of the west against Islam. They have explicitly said they want to drive a wedge ... There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world and we don&#x27;t want a war with all of them. We don&#x27;t need a war with all of them. We&#x27;re not opposed to all of them.&quot; King noted that U.S. forces fought alongside Muslim Iraqi troops, and that Muslim nations shared valuable counterterrorism intelligence with the U.S.

In 2018, King introduced legislation to halt separations of immigrant families at the border.

In June 2019, King and Senator Susan Collins released a joint statement confirming that they had questioned U.S. Customs and Border Protection &quot;on the process being used to clear&quot; asylum seekers for transportation to Portland, Maine, and opined that it was &quot;clearly not a sustainable approach to handling the asylum situation.&quot; Collins and King were said to both be &quot;interested in providing additional resources to the federal agencies that process asylum claims, so we can reduce the existing backlog and adjudicate new claims in a more timely fashion.&quot;

=== Railroad safety ===
In June 2019, King was one of ten senators to cosponsor the Safe Freight Act, a bill that would require freight trains have one or more certified conductors and a certified engineer aboard who can collaborate on how to protect both the train and people living near the tracks. The legislation was meant to correct a Federal Railroad Administration rollback of a proposed rule intended to establish safety standards.

===Same-sex marriage===
King supports same-sex marriage. He signed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; encouraging it to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. Additionally, King voted for the Respect for Marriage Act in 2022.

=== Telecommunications ===
In April 2019, King was one of seven senators to sponsor the Digital Equity Act of 2019, legislation establishing a $120 million grant program that would fund both the creation and implementation of &quot;comprehensive digital equity plans&quot; in each U.S. state to support projects developed by individuals and groups. The bill also gave the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) the role of evaluating and providing guidance for digital equity projects.

=== United States Postal Service ===
In March 2019, King was a cosponsor of a bipartisan resolution led by Gary Peters and Jerry Moran that opposed privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS), citing the USPS as a self-sustained establishment and noting concerns that privatization could cause higher prices and reduced services for its customers, especially in rural communities.

==Personal life==
King&#x27;s first wife was Edie Birney. She is the mother of King&#x27;s three older sons. King and Birney divorced in 1982.

Since 1984, King has been married to Mary Herman. King has five children and six grandchildren.

King is an Episcopalian and attends St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Brunswick. He rides a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

As of 2018, King&#x27;s net worth, according to OpenSecrets.org, was more than $9.4 million.

===Health issues===
In June 2015, King underwent a successful surgery that removed a cancerous prostate that had been detected in a screening and biopsy. The surgery did not change King&#x27;s plans to run for reelection in 2018.

On August 19, 2021, King and fellow senators Roger Wicker and John Hickenlooper tested positive for COVID-19. He fully recovered from the virus, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel great during the worst of my illness, but I&#x27;m confident that I would have felt a whole lot worse if I hadn&#x27;t received the vaccine&quot;.

<text>The grapheme Čč (Latin C with caron, also known as háček in Czech, mäkčeň in Slovak, kvačica in Serbo-Croatian, and strešica in Slovene) is used in various contexts, usually denoting the voiceless postalveolar affricate consonant like the English &quot;ch&quot; in the word &quot;chocolate&quot;. It is represented in Unicode as U+010C (uppercase Č) and U+010D (lowercase č).

==Origin==
The symbol originates with the 15th-century Czech alphabet as introduced by the reforms of Jan Hus. In 1830, it was adopted into Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet, which is used in Serbo-Croatian. It is also used in Macedonian, Slovak, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Pomak, and Berber alphabets.

==Uses==

In Berber, Karelian, Slovenian,
Serbo-Croatian,
Sorbian, Skolt Sami, and Lakota alphabets, it is the fourth letter of the alphabet. In the Czech, Northern Sami, Belarusian Latin, Lithuanian and Latvian alphabets, the letter is in fifth place. In Slovak, it is the sixth letter of the alphabet. It is also used in Pashto (equivalent to چ), Syriac latinization and Saanich.

It is equivalent to Ч in Cyrillic and can be used in Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian, Serbian, and Bulgarian romanisations. It features more prominently in the Latin alphabets or transliterations of Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian. The letter Č can also be substituted by Ç in the transliterations of Turkic languages, either using the Latin script or the Cyrillic script.

/Č/ is also used in Americanist phonetic notation.

Č is the similar to the Sanskrit च (a palatal sound, although IAST uses the letter c to denote it)

==Software==

Representation in software follows the same rules as the háček.

===Unicode===
U+010C (uppercase Č—use Alt 268 for input) and U+010D (lowercase č—use Alt 269 for input) create this character. The combining character U+030C can be placed together with either c or C to generally achieve the same visual result.

===TeX/LaTeX===

In text the control sequence \v{c} will work. In math mode, $\check{c}$ also works.

<text>Newfane is a town in Niagara County, New York, United States. The population was 9,666 at the 2010 census.

The Town of Newfane is in the north-central part of the county, north of the City of Lockport.

== History ==
The Town of Newfane was established in 1824 by Wesley R. Rupert and others. The Newfane name was selected by early settlers who had roots in Newfane, Vermont. The town was created from portions of the Towns of Hartland, Somerset, and Wilson. The first town meeting was held at the Van Horn Mansion in 1824. The Newfane township consists of six hamlets; Appleton, Burt, the Newfane village, Olcott, Ridgewood and the northern portion of Wright&#x27;s Corners. The Newfane village was once named &quot;Charlotteville,&quot; but renamed Newfane, and Olcott was named Kempville in early times.

Its school district includes an early childhood center, an elementary school, a middle school, and one high school. The school&#x27;s mascot is a panther.

In Olcott, there is a monument with a handful of names of soldiers who fought for the Union cause in the American Civil War. In total, 252 Union soldiers came from Newfane, of whom about 55 died during service. Olcott is also home to an original Herschell Carousel. The Carousel was built in 1928 and recently celebrated its 80th anniversary.

The town has two properties on the National Register of Historic Places: the First Baptist Church and the Van Horn Mansion.

<text>The Extended Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet (X-SAMPA) is a variant of SAMPA developed in 1995 by John C. Wells, professor of phonetics at University College London. It is designed to unify the individual language SAMPA alphabets, and extend SAMPA to cover the entire range of characters in the 1993 version of International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The result is a SAMPA-inspired remapping of the IPA into 7-bit ASCII. 

SAMPA was devised as a hack to work around the inability of text encodings to represent IPA symbols. Later, as Unicode support for IPA symbols became more widespread, the necessity for a separate, computer-readable system for representing the IPA in ASCII decreased. However, X-SAMPA is still useful as the basis for an input method for true IPA.

== Summary ==
=== Notes ===
* The IPA symbols that are ordinary lower case letters have the same value in X-SAMPA as they do in the IPA.
* X-SAMPA uses backslashes as modifying suffixes to create new symbols. For example, codice_1 is a distinct sound from codice_2, to which it bears no relation. Such use of the backslash character can be a problem, since many programs interpret it as an escape character for the character following it. For example, such X-SAMPA symbols do not work in EMU, so backslashes must be replaced with some other symbol (e.g., an asterisk: &#x27;*&#x27;) when adding phonemic transcription to an EMU speech database. The backslash has no fixed meaning.
* X-SAMPA diacritics follow the symbols they modify. Except for codice_3 for nasalization, codice_4 for syllabicity, and codice_5 for retroflexion and rhotacization, diacritics are joined to the character with the underscore character codice_6.
* The underscore character is also used to encode the IPA tiebar: codice_7 codes for .
* The numbers codice_8 to codice_9 are reserved diacritics as shorthand for language-specific tone numbers.
* The IETF language tags registry has assigned as the subtag for text transcribed in X-SAMPA.

=== Lower-case symbols ===
=== Capital symbols ===
=== Other symbols ===

=== Consonants ===

* Asterisks (*) mark sounds that do not have X-SAMPA symbols. Daggers (†) mark IPA symbols that have recently been added to Unicode. Since April 2008, the latter is the case of the labiodental flap, symbolized by a right-hook &quot;v&quot; in the IPA: . A convention for the labiodental flap does not yet exist in X-SAMPA.

<text>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court that recognized the First Amendment rights of students in U.S. public schools. The &quot;Tinker&quot; test, also known as the &quot;substantial disruption&quot; test, is still used by courts today to determine whether a school&#x27;s interest to prevent disruption infringes upon students&#x27; First Amendment rights. The Court famously opined, &quot;It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.&quot;

On December 16, 1965, five students in Des Moines, Iowa, decided to wear black armbands to school in protest of American involvement in the Vietnam War and supporting the Christmas Truce that was called for by Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Among the students were John F. Tinker (15 years old), his siblings Mary Beth Tinker (13 years old), Hope Tinker (11 years old), and Paul Tinker (8 years old), along with their friend Christopher Eckhardt (16 years old). The students wore the armbands to several schools in the Des Moines Independent Community School District (North High School for John, Roosevelt High School for Christopher, Warren Harding Junior High School for Mary Beth, elementary school for Hope and Paul).

The Tinker family had been involved in civil rights activism before the student protest. The Tinker children&#x27;s mother, Lorena, was a leader of the Peace Organization in Des Moines. Christopher Eckhardt and John Tinker attended a protest the previous month against the Vietnam War in Washington, D.C. The principals of the Des Moines schools learned of the plan and met before the incident occurred on December 16 to create a policy that stated that school children wearing an armband would be asked to remove it immediately. Students violating the policy would be suspended and allowed to return to school after agreeing to comply with it. The participants decided to violate this policy. Hope and Paul Tinker were not in violation of the policy, since the policy was not applicable to elementary schools, and were not punished. No violence or disruption was proven to have occurred due to the students wearing the armbands. Mary Beth Tinker and Christopher Eckhardt were suspended from school for wearing the armbands on December 16 and John Tinker was suspended for doing the same on the following day.

===Legal precedents and issues===
Previous decisions, such as &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;, had established that students did have some constitutional protections in public school. This case was the first time that the court set forth standards for safeguarding public school students&#x27; free speech rights. This case involved symbolic speech, which was first recognized in &quot;Stromberg v. California&quot;.

== Lower courts ==
A suit was filed after the Iowa Civil Liberties Union approached the Tinker family, and the ICLU agreed to help with the lawsuit. Dan Johnston was the lead attorney on the case.

The Des Moines Independent Community School District represented the school officials who suspended the students. The children&#x27;s fathers filed suit in the U.S. District Court, which upheld the decision of the Des Moines school board.

A tie vote in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit meant that the U.S. District Court&#x27;s decision continued to stand, which forced the Tinkers and Eckhardts to appeal to the Supreme Court directly.

The only students involved in the lawsuit were Mary Beth Tinker, John Tinker, and Christopher Eckhardt. During the case, the Tinker family received hate mail, death threats, and other hateful messages.

The case was argued before the court on November 12, 1968. It was funded by the Des Moines residents Louise Noun, who was the president of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union, and her brother, Joseph Rosenfield, a businessman.

==Decision==
=== Majority opinion ===
The court&#x27;s 7–2 decision in favor of the students held that the First Amendment applied to public schools, and that administrators would have to demonstrate constitutionally valid reasons for any specific regulation of speech in the classroom. Justice Abe Fortas wrote the majority opinion, holding that the speech regulation at issue in Tinker was &quot;based upon an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression, even by the silent symbol of armbands, of opposition to this Nation&#x27;s part in the conflagration in Vietnam.&quot; This decision made students and adults equal in terms of First Amendment rights while at school. &quot;Bethel School District v. Fraser&quot; and &quot;Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier&quot; later rewrote this implication, limiting the freedoms granted to students.

The Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they &quot;must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint,&quot; that the conduct that would &quot;materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.&quot; The Court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech. The Court ruled that First Amendment rights were not absolute, and could be withheld if there was a &quot;carefully restricted circumstance.&quot; Student speech that has the potential to cause disruption is not protected by &quot;Tinker.&quot;

===Dissents===
Justices Hugo Black and John M. Harlan II dissented. Black, who had long believed that disruptive &quot;symbolic speech&quot; was not constitutionally protected, wrote, &quot;While I have always believed that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or censor the content of speech, I have never believed that any person has a right to give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases.&quot; Black argued that the Tinkers&#x27; behavior was indeed disruptive and declared, &quot;I repeat that if the time has come when pupils of state-supported schools, kindergarten, can defy and flout orders of school officials to keep their minds on their own schoolwork, it is the beginning of a new revolutionary era of permissiveness in this country fostered by the judiciary.&quot;

Harlan dissented on the grounds that he &quot;[found] nothing in this record which impugns the good faith of respondents in promulgating the armband regulation.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Subsequent jurisprudence===
&quot;Tinker&quot; remains a viable and frequently cited court precedent, and court decisions citing &quot;Tinker&quot; have both protected and limited the scope of student free speech rights. &quot;Tinker&quot; was cited in the 1973 court case &quot;Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri&quot;, which ruled that the expulsion of a student for distributing a newspaper on campus containing what the school deemed to be &quot;indecent speech&quot; violated the First Amendment. In the 1986 court case &quot;Bethel School District v. Fraser&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that a high school student&#x27;s sexual innuendo-laden speech during a school assembly was not constitutionally protected. The court said the protection of student political speech created in the &quot;Tinker&quot; case did not extend to vulgar language in a school setting. The court ruled that similar language may be constitutionally protected if used by adults to make a political point, but that those protections did not apply to students in a public school.

&quot;Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier&quot; was a 1988 court case where a high school principal blocked the school paper from publishing two articles about divorce and teenage pregnancy. The Supreme Court ruled that schools have the right to regulate the content of non-forum, school-sponsored newspapers under &quot;legitimate pedagogical concerns.&quot; The court reasoned that the principal&#x27;s editorial decision was justified because the paper was a non-public forum since it was school-sponsored and existed as a platform for students in a journalism class. The Court in &quot;Hazelwood&quot; said that under the doctrine of &quot;Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators Association,&quot; a 1982 court case that clarified the definition of a public forum, a school facility like a newspaper only qualifies as a public forum if school authorities make those facilities available for &quot;indiscriminate use by the general public.&quot;

The Court&#x27;s rulings in &quot;Fraser&quot; and &quot;Hazelwood&quot; state that a &quot;substantial disruption&quot; or infringing on the rights of other students was reason enough to restrict student freedom of speech or expression. Some experts argue that the three individual cases each act independently of one another and govern different types of student speech. It is argued that &quot;Fraser&quot; does not interfere with &quot;Tinker&quot;, since &quot;Fraser&quot; questions sexual speech while &quot;Tinker&quot; protects political speech. While some believe that &quot;Tinker&#x27;s&quot; protections were overturned by &quot;Fraser&quot; and &quot;Kuhlmeier,&quot; others believe that the latter cases created exceptions to the &quot;Tinker&quot; ruling. Others argue that a broad reading of &quot;Tinker&quot; allows for viewpoint discrimination on certain topics of student speech.

In 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit re-heard a case &quot;en banc&quot; that had been argued before a panel of three of its judges, considering whether middle school students could be prohibited from wearing bracelets promoting breast cancer awareness that were imprinted with &quot;I ♥ Boobies! (Keep a Breast).&quot; The Third Circuit cited &quot;Tinker&quot; when ruling that the school&#x27;s ban on the bracelets violated the students&#x27; right to free speech because the bracelets were not plainly offensive or disruptive. The court also cited &quot;Fraser,&quot; saying the bracelets were not lewd speech. The Supreme Court later declined to take up the case.

Several cases have arisen from the modern display of the Confederate flag. Courts applying the &quot;substantial disruption test&quot; under &quot;Tinker&quot; have held that schools may prohibit students from wearing clothing with Confederate symbols. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit cited &quot;Tinker&quot; in the 2013 court case &quot;Hardwick v. Heyward&quot; to rule that prohibiting a student from wearing Confederate flag shirt did not violate the First Amendment because there was evidence that the shirt could cause disruption. Exceptions to this are the 2010 court case &quot;Defoe v. Spiva&quot; and the 2000 court case &quot;Castorina v. Madison County School Board&quot;. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit said in &quot;Castorina v. Madison County School Board&quot; that based on &quot;Tinker&quot; and other Supreme Court rulings, the school board could not ban Confederate flag T-shirts while other &quot;controversial racial and political symbols&quot; like the &quot;X&quot; symbol associated with Malcolm X and the African American Muslim movement were permitted. In &quot;Defoe v. Spiva&quot;, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that &quot;racially hostile or contemptuous speech&quot; can be restricted, even if it was not disruptive. This deviated from the &quot;Tinker&quot; ruling, which said the school&#x27;s restriction of the Tinkers&#x27; speech was unconstitutional because it was not disruptive.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied &quot;Tinker&quot; in February 2014 to rule that a California school did not violate the First Amendment in &quot;Dariano v. Morgan Hill Unified School District&quot;, where a school banned American flag apparel during a Cinco de Mayo celebration. The school said they had enacted the ban due to a conflict caused by American flag apparel that had occurred at the event the previous year. The Ninth Circuit declined to re-hear the case &quot;en banc&quot; and the U.S. Supreme Court later declined to review the case.

A Pennsylvania high school cheerleader, who had been reprimanded by her school for using offensive language in a social media post that she made off-campus and outside school hours, filed suit against the school in 2017 claiming her First Amendment rights had been infringed. The district court ruled in her favor, and the school district appealed to the Third Circuit. There, the three-judge panel upheld the district ruling unanimously, but the majority stated that &quot;Tinker&quot; could never apply to off-campus speech made by a student, while Judge Thomas L. Ambro believed this was too broad a claim. The school petitioned to the Supreme Court, which ruled in June 2021 in &quot;Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.&quot; to uphold the ruling in favor of the student, but overturning the decision of the Third Circuit in that &quot;Tinker&quot; may cover some parts of off-campus speech when the school has a compelling interest, such as for incidents of harassments or threats. However, the Supreme Court did not attempt to define when such off-campus speech fell under a school&#x27;s compelling interest.

=== &quot;Tinker&quot; Tour ===
Mary Beth Tinker decided to embark on a tour around the United States, called the Tinker Tour, beginning in 2013 to &quot;bring real-life civics lessons to students through the Tinker armband story and the stories of other young people.&quot; The tour is a project of the Student Press Law Center.

<doc id="496727" wikidata="Q1984484" url="?curid=496727" title="Colonial mentality">
<text>A colonial mentality is the internalized attitude of ethnic or cultural inferiority felt by people as a result of colonization, i.e. them being colonized by another group. It corresponds with the belief that the cultural values of the colonizer are inherently superior to one&#x27;s own. The term has been used by postcolonial scholars to discuss the transgenerational effects of colonialism present in former colonies following decolonization. It is commonly used as an operational concept for framing ideological domination in historical colonial experiences. In psychology, colonial mentality has been used to explain instances of collective depression, anxiety, and other widespread mental health issues in populations that have experienced colonization.
Notable Marxist influences on the postcolonial concept of colonial mentality include Frantz Fanon&#x27;s works on the fracturing of the colonial psyche through Western cultural domination, as well as the concept of cultural hegemony developed by Italian Communist Party Founder Antonio Gramsci.

== Influences from Marxism ==

=== Frantz Fanon ===
Frantz Fanon&#x27;s Marxist writings on imperialism, racism, and decolonizing struggles have influenced post-colonial discussions about the internalization of colonial prejudice. Fanon first tackled the problem of, what he called, the &quot;colonial alienation of the person&quot; as a mental health issue through psychiatric analysis.

In &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; (French: &quot;Les Damnés de la Terre&quot;), published in 1961, Fanon used psychiatry to analyze how French colonization and the carnage of the Algerian War had mentally affected Algerians&#x27; self-identity and mental health. The book argues that during the period of colonization there was a subtle and constant mental pathology that developed within the colonial psyche. Fanon argued that the colonial psyche is fractured by the lack of mental and material homogeneity as a result of the colonial power&#x27;s Western culture being pressured onto the colonized population despite the existing material differences between them.

Here Fanon expands traditional Marxist understandings of historical materialism to explore how the dissonance between material existence and culture functions to transform the colonized people through the mold of the Western bourgeoisie. This meant that the native Algerian came to view their own traditional culture and identity through the lens of colonial prejudice. Fanon observed that average Algerians internalized and then openly repeated remarks that were in line with the institutionalized racist culture of the French colonizers; dismissing their own culture as backward due to the internalization of Western colonial ideologies.

According to Fanon this results in a destabilizing existential conflict within the colonized culture:&quot;In the West, the family circle, the effects of education, and the relatively high standard of living of the working class provide a more or less efficient protection against the harmful action of these pastimes. But in an African country, where mental development is uneven, where the violent collision of two worlds has considerably shaken old traditions and thrown the universe of the perceptions out of focus, the impressionability and sensibility of the Young African are at the mercy of the various assaults made upon them by the very Nature of Western Culture.&quot;

==Colonial India==
During the period of European colonial rule in India, Europeans in India typically regarded many aspects Indian culture with disdain and supported colonial rule as a beneficial &quot;civilizing mission&quot;. Colonial rule in India was framed as an act which was beneficial to the people of India, rather than a process of political and economic dominance by a small minority of foreigners.

Under colonial rule, many practices were outlawed, such as the practice of forcing widows to immolate themselves (known as sati) with acts being deemed idolatrous being discouraged by Evangelical missionaries, the latter of which has been claimed by some scholars to have played a large role in the developments of the modern definition of Hinduism. These claims base their assumptions on the lack of a unified Hindu identity prior to the period of colonial rule, and modern Hinduism&#x27;s unprecedented outward focus on a monotheistic Vedanta worldview. These developments have been read as the result of colonial views which discouraged aspects of Indian religions which differed significantly from Christianity. It has been noted that the prominence of the Bhagavad Gita as a primary religious text in Hindu discourse was a historical response to European criticisms of Indian culture. Europeans found that the Gita had more in common with their own Christian Bible, leading to the denouncement of Hindu practices more distantly related to monotheistic world views; with some historians claiming that Indians began to characterize their faith as the equivalent of Christianity in belief (especially in terms of monotheism) and structure (in terms of providing an equivalent primary sacred text).
Hindu nationalism developed in the 19th century as an opposition to European ideological prominence; however, local Indian elites often aimed to make themselves and Indian society modern by &quot;emulating the West&quot;. This led to the emergence of what some have termed &#x27;neo-Hinduism&#x27;: consisting of reformist rhetoric transforming Hindu tradition from above, disguised as a revivalist call to return to the traditional practises of the faith. Reflecting the same arguments made by Christian missionaries, who argued that the more superstitious elements of Hindu practice were responsible for corrupting the potential rational philosophy of the faith (i.e. the more Christian-like sentiments). Moving the definitions of Hindu practice away from more overt idol worshiping, reemphasizing the concept of Brahman as a monotheistic divinity, and focusing more on the figure of Krishna in Vaishnavism due to his role as a messianic type figure (more inline with European beliefs) which makes him a suitable alternative to the Christian figure of Jesus Christ.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India&#x27;s current ruling party, follows this tradition of nationalistic Hinduism (Hindutva), and promotes an Indian national identity infused with neo-Vedantic which has been claimed by some to have been influenced by a &quot;colonial mentality&quot;.

Some critics have claimed that writer Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s portrayals of Indian characters in his works supported the view that colonized people were incapable of living without the help of Europeans, describing these portrayals as racist. In his famous poem &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, Kipling directly argues for this point by romanticizing the &quot;civilising mission&quot; in non-Western countries. Jaway Syed has claimed that Kipling&#x27;s poems idolizes Western culture as entirely rational and civilized, while treating non-white cultures as &#x27;childlike&#x27; and &#x27;demonic&#x27;. Similar sentiments have been interpreted in Kipling&#x27;s other works, such as his characterization of the Second Boer War as a &quot;white man&#x27;s war&quot;; along with his presentation of &#x27;whiteness&#x27; as a morally and culturally superior trait of the West. His portrayal of Indians in his &quot;Jungle Book&quot; stories have also been criticized by Jane Hotchkiss as examples of the chauvinistic infantilization of colonized peoples in popular culture. Some historians claim that Kipling&#x27;s works have contributed towards the development of a colonial mentality in the ways that the colonized people in these fictional narratives are made submissive to and dependent on their white rulers.

==Spanish Empire==

===Latin America===

In the overseas territories administered by the Spanish Empire, racial mixing between Spanish settlers and the indigenous peoples resulted in a prosperous union later called Mestizo. There were limitations in the racial classes only to people from African descent, this mainly for being descendants of slaves under a current state of slavery. Unlike Mestizos, castizos or indigenous people who were protected by the Leyes de las Indias &quot;to be treated like equals, as citizens of the Spanish Empire&quot;. It was completely forbidden to enslave the &quot;indígenas&quot; under the death penalty charge. 
Mestizos and other mixed raced combinations were categorized into different castas by viceroyalty administrators. This system was applied to Spanish territories in the Americas and the Philippines, where large populations of mixed raced individuals made up the increasing majority of the viceroyalty population (until the present day).
These racial categories punished those with Black African or Afro-Latin heritage; those of European descent were given privilege over these other mixtures. As a result of this system, people of African descent struggled to downplay their indigenous heritage and cultural trappings, in order to appear superficially more Spanish or natives. With these internalized prejudices individuals&#x27; choices of clothes, occupations, and forms of religious expression. Those of mixed racial identities who wanted to receive the institutional benefits of being Spanish (such as higher educational institutions and career opportunities), could do so by suppressing their own cultures and acting with &quot;Spanishness&quot;. This mentality lead to commonplace racial forgery in Latin America, often accompanied by legitimizing oral accounts of a Spanish ancestor and a Spanish surname. Most mixed-white and white people in Latin America have Spanish surnames inherited from Spanish ancestors, while most other Latin Americans who have Spanish names and surnames acquired them through the Christianization and Hispanicization of the indigenous and African slave populations by Spanish friars.

However, most initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as Amerindian groups simply blended Catholicism with their traditional beliefs. Syncretism between native beliefs and Christianity is still largely prevalent in Indian and Mestizo communities in Latin America.

===Philippines===

Prior to the arrival by the Spaniards (1565–1898), the Sulu Archipelago (located in southern Philippines) was a colony of the Majapahit Empire (1293–1527) based in Indonesia. The Americans were the last country to colonize the Philippines (1898–1946) and nationalists claim that it continues to act as a neo-colony of the US despite its formal independence in 1946. In the Philippines colonial mentality is most evident in the preference for Filipino mestizos (primarily those of mixed native Filipino and white ancestry, but also mixed indigenous Filipinos and Chinese, and other ethnic groups) in the entertainment industry and mass media, in which they have received extensive exposure despite constituting a small fraction of the population.

The Cádiz Constitution of 1812 automatically gave Spanish citizenship to all Filipinos regardless of race. The census of 1870 stated that at least one-third of the population of Luzon had partial Hispanic ancestry (from varying points of origin and ranging from Latin America to Spain).

The combined number of all types of white mestizos or Eurasians is 3.6%, according to a genetic study by Stanford University. This is contradicted by another genetic study done by California University which stated that Filipinos possess moderate amounts of European admixture.

A cultural preference for relatively light skinned people exists within the Philippines. According to Kevin Nadal and David Okazaki, light skin preference may have pre-colonial origins. However, they also suggest that this preference was strengthened by colonialism. In an undated Philippine epic, the hero covers his face with a shield so that the sun would not &quot;lessen his handsome looks&quot;. Some regard this as proof that desire for light-colored skin predates overseas influences. Regardless of the origin of the preference, the use of skin bleaching remains prevalent among Filipino men and women, however there is also a growing embrace of darker skinned female aesthetic within the Philippines.

<text>The University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire – Barron County (also known as UWEC–Barron County or UWEC–BC) is a branch campus to the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. It is located in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, and is a member of the University of Wisconsin System. As of the 2016–17 school year, there were 497 full and part-time students.

UWEC–BC is located on approximately of partially wooded land. Six buildings comprise the campus. These include Meggers Hall/Ritzinger Hall (administration and classrooms), the Fine Arts Building, library, gymnasium, student center, and physical plant. Other educational and recreational facilities include an observatory, a Japanese Garden, a three-hole golf course, baseball diamonds, soccer fields, an eighteen-hole disc golf course, and a prairie restoration and wildlife habitat study area. The Cedar Side Walking Trail runs directly between the campus and the Red Cedar River.

==History==
 The story of UW-Barron County began in the fall of 1963 when the Wisconsin Coordinating Committee for Higher Education (CCHE) recommended that a two-year liberal arts institution be established in Rice Lake. In April 1964 the Barron County Board of Supervisors undertook the commitment to fund the physical facilities of the &#x27;Branch Campus&#x27; with state and federal aid.

The Board of Regents of the State University System designated Stout State University in Menomonie to be the parent institution. Then in November 1965 the Barron County Board of Supervisors authorized the issuance of a $1,500,000 bond issue and tax levy to help finance the institution. And in February 1966 the 142-acre Johnson-Zimmer tract in the south of the city and abutting the east shore of the Red Cedar River was selected as the site for the new campus. For $50,000 the city took title to the property and delivered the deed to Barron County.

In February 1966 Stout State University President William J. Micheels named Dr. John F. Meggers as the first dean of the campus. The newly formed Barron County Campus of Stout State University opened in September 1966, offering a freshman course curriculum to over 100 students in the Ann Street facility which was headquarters for the Barron County Teacher&#x27;s College. The addition of basic sophomore courses was added the following year, which caused the campus&#x27; enrollment to increase dramatically. In June 1967 the Barron County Teacher&#x27;s College graduated their final class of students and ceased to exist.

In April 1967 groundbreaking ceremonies were held on the site of the new campus after the County Board approved the final bids and alternates on the $3,000,000 project. The architectural firm of Hirsch &amp; Stevens of St. Paul was hired to design the structures and the Rice Lake firm of Vonasek &amp; Schieffer was selected as the general contractor. In September 1967 bricks and mortar rose on the Johnson-Zimmer site and the campus embarked on the second year of liberal arts studies with 201 students, still in the makeshift quarters.

March 1968 was moving day from the Ann Street facility into the new seven building campus, and two months later, on Memorial Day, the first two-year graduation class participated in commencement exercises at the new campus. The formal dedication of the Barron County Campus of Stout State University in Rice Lake, Wisconsin was held in September 1968.

With the 1972 merger of the University of Wisconsin and State University Systems, the campus became part of the University of Wisconsin Center System and was known as UW Center-Barron County, until 1983 when the institution became known as the University of Wisconsin Centers. In 1997, the name of the institution was changed to the University of Wisconsin Colleges and the campus name to UW–Barron County.

Friday, October 27, 2006, marked the dedication of the $6.4 million expansion/renovation project and 40th anniversary celebration. The renovation project connected Meggers and Ritzinger Hall and offered state-of-the-art science labs, high-tech classrooms, tutorial facilities, and a comfortable student activity space.

==UW system restructuring==
On October 11, 2017, the University of Wisconsin System President, Ray Cross, announced a proposal for merging the 13 two-year UW Colleges with four-year UW institutions. There were two main reasons for the restructuring: enrollment across all of the 13 two-year colleges had declined 32% on average (−35% for UW–Barron County) from 2010 through 2017, as well as current demographic trends indicate that current enrollment challenges are not likely to significantly improve in coming years, with current projections for 2040 indicating a mere 0.4% increase of people age 18–64 in Wisconsin.

The Higher Learning Commission approved the joining of UW-Barron County and UW-Eau Claire on June 29, 2018. The merger became effective on July 1, 2018.

==Notable alumni==
* Roger Rivard, politician and businessman
* Patricia Spafford Smith, politician and businesswoman

==Academics==
UWEC–BC provides the first two years of a liberal arts general education, and the campus awards graduating students with the Associate of Arts and Sciences degree. The college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

Most students can complete all the appropriate general education courses for their major at the campus. Areas of study that are available include pre-professional programs, agriculture and natural resources, the biological sciences, business, communications and letters, education, engineering, fine arts, foreign languages, health studies, mathematics and computer science, the physical sciences, public affairs and service, and the social sciences.

UWEC–Barron County offers both a textbook rental system and the option to purchase new and used materials through an onsite bookstore or though their website.

==Athletics==
UWEC–Barron County athletic teams are called the &quot;Chargers&quot;. As of the 2017-18 school year, the Chargers belong to the Wisconsin Collegiate Conference (WCC) which comprises the fourteen UW Colleges campuses, and the Wisconsin Junior College Athletic Association (WJCAA). Charger sports include golf, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s basketball, and men&#x27;s club baseball. Following the merger with UW–Eau Claire, the school&#x27;s colors changed from maroon and white to blue and gold. The campus changed to the Blugolds in 2022/23 finalizing the integration with the main campus.

<text>The University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire (UW–Eau Claire, UWEC or simply Eau Claire) is a public university in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the University of Wisconsin System and offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. As of 2024, the university had an enrollment of approximately 9,500 students.

The campus consists of 28 major buildings spanning . An additional of forested land is used for environmental research. UWEC is situated on the Chippewa River.

The university is affiliated with the NCAA&#x27;s Division III and the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC). The student body&#x27;s mascot is Blu the Blugold.

==History==
Founded in 1916 as the Eau Claire State Normal School, the university originally offered one-, two- and three-year teachers&#x27; courses and a principals&#x27; course. At the school&#x27;s founding ceremony Governor Emanuel L. Philipp said the university was founded &quot;in order that you, the sons and daughters of the commonwealth, might have better educational service.&quot; He went on to say the university would &quot;go on benefiting the state of Wisconsin as long as the walls of this massive building (Schofield Hall) last.&quot;

As a college primarily focused on educating teachers, Eau Claire housed Park Elementary, a laboratory school. Park Elementary had an unusual architectural design that included a hidden third story balcony used by professors and student teachers to observe classes.

As a result of the changing educational focus of the university, this method of teaching new teachers fell out of use and Park Elementary School was closed. Most of the building was repurposed for general university classroom use, with about a third of the space dedicated to a child daycare center. The building was demolished in 2012.

In 1927, the name of the college was changed to Eau Claire State Teachers College and the school began offering a bachelor&#x27;s degree program. The campus was also altered to accommodate a 300-man detachment from the Army Air Corps.

Eau Claire&#x27;s role as an educational institution underwent profound changes in the 1940s and 1950s. The university saw a significant rise in enrollment and widened its scope beyond educating future teachers. Eau Claire president W. R. Davies, speaking at a university assembly, said &quot;the goal is a college of education that will rank as one of the best in the middlewest, with a wide enough offering to truly serve the needs of the college youth of northwest Wisconsin.&quot; In 1951, the Wisconsin Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System authorized the school to offer Bachelor of Arts and science degrees in liberal arts; subsequently, the name of the school was changed to the Wisconsin State College at Eau Claire.

During the 1960s, the university saw further expansion. Science and art buildings were erected and several dormitories were built or expanded to meet the needs of an ever-growing student population. The university began to market itself more aggressively because of increased competition from surrounding campuses. Eau Claire&#x27;s nickname – &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s Most Beautiful Campus&quot; – was first developed during this time. Highlighting the university&#x27;s aesthetic appeal, an Eau Claire poet wrote, &quot;Through and from a shady glen / A charming streamlet hies / And rippling along its picturesque way / A campus glorifies.&quot; In 1964, the Board of Regents gave university standing to the state colleges, and the institution at Eau Claire was renamed Wisconsin State University – Eau Claire. The 1960s are remembered as a &quot;flowering of excellence on the campus.&quot;

In 1962, Martin Luther King Jr. visited the campus and called on president John F. Kennedy to issue a second Emancipation Proclamation. King said &quot;the first proclamation freed us from slavery – the second will free us from segregation, which is actually nothing more than slavery.&quot;

During the late 1960s, the university was involved in several protests against the Vietnam War, including a 42-hour vigil and several marches. Though there were numerous protests, all of them remained peaceful. After the Kent State shootings, the university community planted four trees as a memorial to the dead students. One protester, Eau Claire student John Laird, the son of U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird, made headlines when he announced his opposition to the war in Vietnam and his intention to join his fellow students in peaceful protest.

In 1971, the name of the institution was changed to the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire following the merger of the Wisconsin State University System and the University of Wisconsin System. In subsequent years, the university would solidify its tradition as a liberal arts campus. Currently, the university&#x27;s stated mission is to provide &quot;rigorous undergraduate liberal education&quot; alongside &quot;distinctive professional and graduate programs that build on and strengthen our proud tradition of liberal education.&quot; Since the 1971 merger, Eau Claire has expanded its course offerings, added more faculty and students, and enlarged campus grounds. Eau Claire has also acquired hundreds of acres of forested land primarily used for environmental research and purchased St. Bede&#x27;s Monastery in October 2011.

In 1974, the Richard E. Hibbard Humanities Hall opened on campus and an addition to the Davies Center was finished three years later in 1977. The Allied Health and Clinical Services Building was constructed in 1982 on the north bank of the Chippewa River, and in 1985 an addition to the Nursing building was constructed and opened. The construction of the new W.R. Davies Center was completed in 2012 and Centennial Hall was completed in 2013, later being opened in 2014. The construction of Centennial Hall was the first building on campus to be constructed and funded by &quot;state dollars&quot; in 30 years, while the new Davies Center was funded completely by student fees. Towers Hall, initially built in 1966, began a renovation project in 2017 starting with Towers South renovations during the 2017–2018 school year followed by Towers North renovations during the 2018–2019 school year. This renovation project was funded completely by student housing fees with expenditures over $35 million.

The university was involved in a gay rights controversy in 2016 when Tom Hilton, an information systems professor, negatively responded to a student email asking for his support for the &quot;Eau Queer Film Festival.&quot; 
UW–Eau Claire was the center of a controversy related to an oak tree sacred to Native Americans. Eventually, after much publicity, it was decided to scrap the old plans, despite the large added expense, and build the 48.8 million dollar building at another location.* In September 2016, a free speech board on campus had &quot;UWEC is racist&quot; written on it and it was promptly taken down. The board sparked a discussion about racial equity and diversity on campus.

In 2018, UW-Eau Claire adopted UW-Barron College as a branch campus. The &quot;merger&quot; was part of a UW-System wide restructuring plan in an attempt to keep from having to shut down any campuses. The goal of merging the two campuses, and the goal of the UW System restructuring, was to expand access to college education for more students in Wisconsin.

In September 2019, a student&#x27;s residence hall door decoration was vandalized with a racial slur against Indigenous people and the words &quot;go back to the rez.&quot;
In November 2019, five football players were suspended from the team for using social media to convey racist messages targeting the campus Black Empowerment Organization.

<text>Alpine climate is the typical climate for elevations above the tree line, where trees fail to grow due to cold. This climate is also referred to as a mountain climate or highland climate.

==Definition==

There are multiple definitions of alpine climate.

In the Köppen climate classification, the alpine and mountain climates are part of group &quot;E&quot;, along with the polar climate, where no month has a mean temperature higher than .

According to the Holdridge life zone system, there are two mountain climates which prevent tree growth :

a) the alpine climate,
which occurs when the mean biotemperature of a location is between . The alpine climate in Holdridge system is roughly equivalent to the warmest tundra climates (ET) in the Köppen system.

b) the alvar climate, the coldest mountain climate since the biotemperature is between 0 °C and 1.5 °C (biotemperature can never be below 0 °C). It corresponds more or less to the coldest tundra climates and to the ice cap climates (EF) as well.

Holdrige reasoned that plants net primary productivity ceases with plants becoming dormant at temperatures below and above . Therefore, he defined biotemperature as the mean of all temperatures but with all temperatures below freezing and above 30 °C adjusted to 0 °C; that is, the sum of temperatures not adjusted is divided by the number of all temperatures (including both adjusted and non-adjusted ones).

The variability of the alpine climate throughout the year depends on the latitude of the location. For tropical oceanic locations, such as the summit of Mauna Loa, the temperature is roughly constant throughout the year. For mid-latitude locations, such as Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the temperature varies seasonally, but never gets very warm.

==Cause==
The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between radiation and convection. Sunlight in the visible spectrum hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly , and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.

However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of convection. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an adiabatic process, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which is approximately 9.8 °C per kilometer (or 5.4 °F per 1000 feet) of altitude.

The presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming clouds), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (5.5 °C per kilometre or 3 °F per 1000 feet). The actual lapse rate, called the environmental lapse rate, is not constant (it can fluctuate throughout the day or seasonally and also regionally), but a normal lapse rate is 5.5 °C per 1,000 m (3.57 °F per 1,000 ft). Therefore, moving up on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometres (50 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors, such as proximity to oceans, can drastically modify the climate. As the altitude increases, the main form of precipitation becomes snow and the winds increase. The temperature continues to drop until the tropopause, at , where it does not decrease further. This is higher than the highest summit.

==Distribution==
Although this climate classification only covers a small portion of the Earth&#x27;s surface, alpine climates are widely distributed. They are present in the Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau, Gansu, Qinghai and Mount Lebanon in Asia; the Alps, the Urals, the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian Mountains and the Sierra Nevada in Europe; the Andes in South America; the Sierra Nevada, the Cascade Range, the Rocky Mountains, the northern Appalachian Mountains (Adirondacks and White Mountains), and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in North America; the Southern Alps in New Zealand; the Snowy Mountains in Australia; high elevations in the Atlas Mountains, Ethiopian Highlands, and Eastern Highlands of Africa; the central parts of Borneo and New Guinea; and the summits of Mount Pico in the Atlantic and Mauna Loa in the Pacific.

The lowest altitude of alpine climate varies dramatically by latitude. If alpine climate is defined by the tree line, then it occurs as low as at 68°N in Sweden, while on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the tree line is at .

<doc id="496731" wikidata="Q862559" url="?curid=496731" title="Prime Minister of Malaysia">
<text>The prime minister of Malaysia (; ) is the head of government of Malaysia. The prime minister directs the executive branch of the federal government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong appoints the prime minister as a member of Parliament (MP) who, in his opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. The prime minister is usually the leader of the party winning the most seats in a general election. 

After the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the chief minister of the Federation of Malaya, became the first prime minister of Malaysia.

== Appointment ==

According to the Federal Constitution, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall first appoint a prime minister to preside over the Cabinet. The prime minister is to be a member of the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives), and who in his majesty&#x27;s judgment is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of that House. This person must be a Malaysian citizen, but cannot have obtained their citizenship by means of naturalisation or registration. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall appoint other ministers from either the Dewan Rakyat or Dewan Negara (Senate) with the prime minister&#x27;s advice.

The prime minister and his/her cabinet ministers must take and subscribe to the oath of office and allegiance as well as the oath of secrecy in the presence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong before they can exercise functions of office. The Cabinet is collectively accountable to the Parliament of Malaysia. The members of the Cabinet shall not hold any office of profit and engage in any trade, business or profession that will cause a conflict of interest. The Prime Minister&#x27;s Department (sometimes referred to as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office) is the body and ministry in which the prime minister exercises his/her functions and powers.

In the case where a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or when the House passes a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; in the government, the prime minister is bound by convention to resign immediately. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s choice of replacement prime minister will be dictated by the circumstances. All other ministers shall continue to hold office by the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, unless if the appointment of any minister is revoked by his/her majesty upon the advice of the prime minister. Any minister may resign his/her office.

Following a resignation in other circumstances, defeat in an election, or the death of a prime minister, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong would generally appoint as the new leader of the governing party or coalition as new Prime Minister.

Malaysia uses first-past-the-post-voting system, which means a party or coalition who gets 112 seats in lower house will lead the government.

== Powers ==

The power of the prime minister is subject to a number of limitations. Prime ministers removed as leader of his or her party, or whose government loses a vote of no confidence in the House of Representatives, must advise a new election of the lower house or resign the office. The defeat of a supply bill (one that concerns the spending of money) or unable to pass important policy-related legislation is seen to require the resignation of the government or dissolution of Parliament, much like a non-confidence vote, since a government that cannot spend money is hamstrung, also called loss of supply.

The prime minister&#x27;s party will normally have a majority in the House of Representatives and party discipline is exceptionally strong in Malaysian politics, so passage of the government&#x27;s legislation through the House of Representatives is mostly a formality.

Under the Constitution, the prime minister&#x27;s role includes advising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on:
* the appointment of the federal ministers (full members of cabinet);
* the appointment of the federal deputy ministers, parliamentary secretaries (non-full members of cabinet);
* the appointment of 44 out of 70 Senators in the Dewan Negara;
* the summoning and adjournment of sittings of the Dewan Rakyat;
* the appointment of judges of the superior courts (which are the High Courts, the Court of Appeal, and the Federal Court);
* the appointment of the attorney-general and the auditor-general; and
* the appointment of the chairmen and members of the Judicial and Legal Service Commission, Election Commission, Police Force Commission, Education Service Commission, National Finance Council, and Armed Forces Council;

Under Article 39 of the Constitution, executive authority is vested in the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. However, Article 40(1) states that in most cases, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is bound to exercise his powers on the advice of the Cabinet or a minister acting under the Cabinet&#x27;s general authority. Thus, in practice, actual governing authority is vested in the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

=== Acting prime minister ===
From time to time, prime ministers are required to leave the country on business and a deputy is appointed to take their place during that time. In the days before jet aeroplanes, such absences could be for extended periods. However, the position can be fully decided by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the king of Malaysia when the position remains empty following the sudden resignation or death of the prime minister.

=== Caretaker prime minister ===
Under Article 55(3) of Constitution of Malaysia, the lower house of Parliament, unless sooner dissolved by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong with his own discretion on the advice of the prime minister, shall continue for five years from the date of its first meeting. Article 55(4) of the Constitution permits a delay of 60 days in the holding of the general election from the date of dissolution and Parliament shall be summoned to meet on a date not later than 120 days from the date of dissolution. Conventionally, between the dissolution of one Parliament and the convening of the next, the prime minister and the cabinet remain in office in a caretaker capacity.

<text>The University of Wisconsin–Parkside (UW Parkside or UWP) is a public university in Somers, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the University of Wisconsin System and has 4,644 students, 161 full-time faculty, and 89 lecturers and part-time faculty. The university offers 33 undergraduate majors and 11 master&#x27;s degrees in 22 academic departments. UW–Parkside is one of two universities in the UW System not named for the city in which it is located, the other being UW–Stout. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

UW–Parkside is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II for athletics. The athletic program is branded as the Parkside Rangers, and its teams wear forest green, black, and white. The Rangers compete in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

== History ==
===Origins and formative years===
The history of University of Wisconsin–Parkside began on September 2, 1965, when the Wisconsin State Assembly approved Senate Bill 48, which mandated the creation of new collegiate institutions in northeastern Wisconsin and the Kenosha–Racine area &quot;as soon as practicable&quot;. Governor Warren Knowles signed the bill into law. Although designated a Senate bill, much of the political force behind the legislation came from Democratic Representative George Molinaro of Kenosha.

In April 1966 a site-selection committee chose a parcel of rolling farmland and woods near Petrifying Springs Park in Kenosha County as the site of the new southeastern University of Wisconsin campus, from around half a dozen alternative options. On April 21, 1966, UW–Madison history professor Irvin Wyllie chose the name University of Wisconsin–Parkside for the campus, writing that: &quot;No place can go anywhere tagged the Petrifying Springs Campus, or snide variations thereof: Putrifying Springs, Stupefying Springs&quot;. In May the same year, Wyllie was named the first chancellor by UW President Fred Harvey Harrington.

In October 1977, author Irving Wallace, a Kenosha native, donated a collection of his books, manuscripts, correspondence, awards and other items to UW–Parkside to establish the Irving Wallace Collection, including plays, screenplays, photographs and other materials. The next month ground was broken for the first two buildings of the new campus. Thirty-one parcels of land were acquired for the $6.5 million first phase of the construction project, mostly through condemnation. The first building was finished in time to hold classes in the fall of 1969. The rest of the campus was finished in 1976 with the opening of the Union. Also in 1967, the historic Chiwaukee Prairie in the south of Kenosha County was named a state natural area as The Nature Conservancy Inc., and began donating the land to UW–Parkside.

In June 1968, the university&#x27;s library opened with 70,000 volumes. A part of the library&#x27;s collection was stored in a barn on one of the former farms purchased for the university. The University of Wisconsin–Parkside was officially founded the following month, taking administrative control of the two-year UW centers in Racine and Kenosha. Classes were held on the two-year centers, which were later disbanded. In December, the Board of Regents named the administration building on Wood Road for Bernard Tallent, dean of the UW–Kenosha center from 1948 until his death in 1965.

In February 1969, a bill introduced in the State Assembly limited UW–Parkside enrollment to 30,000, with the university&#x27;s master plan envisioning eventual enrollment of 25,000. In September 1969, the university accepted its first students, holding classes in Greenquist Hall. Enrollment across the three campus sites (including the two former two-year UW Centers in Kenosha and Racine) was 2,911. In November the same year, students chose the name &quot;Rangers&quot; for the university&#x27;s athletics teams. In May 1970, a host of dignitaries were invited to officially dedicate the new university at the end of its first year. In June the first cohort of 36 students graduated at a modest ceremony in Greenquist Hall with 500 attendees. George Becker of Kenosha was the first to receive his diploma.

In April 1971 the first UW–Parkside student government was elected, and in October that year the State Legislature approved a bill to merge the four-campus University of Wisconsin with the Wisconsin State Universities, creating the University of Wisconsin System. The move had a profound effect on the growth of the UW–Parkside campus. In December 1971, three UW–Parkside researchers, Eugene Goodman, Ben Greenebaum and Michael Marron, received a United States Navy grant to study the effects of a proposed Navy communications system, Project Sanguine, on the cells of slime mold. Since then, the three researchers and others have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in further grants to study the effects of the communication system on living organisms.

In Summer 1972, UW–Parkside runner Lucien Rosa competed in the Olympic marathon in Munich, representing his home country of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He later became the head men&#x27;s cross country and track coach at the university. In September that year, the Library/Learning Center and the Physical Education Building opened to the public. The library&#x27;s collection included 200,000 books and 1,700 periodicals, and later grew to include more than 365,000 volumes, 1,680 periodicals, 4,720 maps and 11,600 audio/visual titles. In March 1973, assistant life sciences professor Omar Amin discovered a new species of tiny parasitic worm in the Pike River and named it &quot;Acanthocephalus parksidei&quot; after the university. In June the same year, the first UW–Parkside Alumni Association was founded, for the around 1,200 alumni of the university.

In July 1975, Alan E. Guskin, acting president of Clark University in Massachusetts, became the second chancellor of UW–Parkside. In Spring 1976, Gary Cole finished his basketball career with a record 2,262 points (20.6 per game) and 1,177 rebounds. Cole, now known as Abdul Jeelani, went on to play for the Portland Trail Blazers and Dallas Mavericks. Around the same time, UW–Parkside race walker Jim Heiring was the university&#x27;s first to compete in the United States Olympic trials in the 20-kilometer walk, narrowly missing out on a place in the team. He went on to become a six-time national champion and member of the 1980, 1984 and 1988 teams. In October 1976 the $3.7 million student union opened.

===1980s===
In January 1980, six athletes became the inaugural members of the UW–Parkside Hall of Fame: Heiring; Jeelani; four-time All-American wrestler Ken Martin; Kim Merritt, the first UW–Parkside woman All-American distance runner; marathoner Lucien Rosa; and wrestler Bill West. In February 1981, the university established the Biomedical Research Institute. Over the next decade, members of the institute were awarded nearly $4 million in research grants. In September 1981, in response to a shortage of nurses, UW–Parkside and UW–Milwaukee enrolled the first students in a cooperative program allowing students to earn a UW–Milwaukee nursing degree by taking courses at UW–Parkside, which became a model for the UW System.

In June 1983, researcher Ross Gundersen demonstrated for the first time that a substance released by developing muscle tissue exerts an attraction on growing spinal nerves, illustrating that growing nerves communicate with the muscles to which they eventually attach. That year the university enrolled a record 6,008 students. In September 1985, Chancellor Guskin left UW–Parkside to become president of Antioch University in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and Sheila I. Kaplan, vice chancellor for academic affairs in the Minnesota State University System, became UW–Parkside&#x27;s third chancellor the following July. In December 1987, the university&#x27;s biological sciences Professor Chong-maw Chen, a researcher on plant hormones and genetic engineering, was named one of six Wisconsin Distinguished Professors by the Board of Regents, and later reappointed in 1993. The following September, the entire Biological Sciences Department was designated a Center of Excellence by the same board, and approval was granted for the university to offer a master&#x27;s degree in applied molecular biology, including the study of advanced techniques in cloning, gene splicing and isolating traits on genetic material. In December 1988, professor of engineering science George Perdikaris was also named a Wisconsin Distinguished Professor of Applied Science.

In February 1989, the UW–Parkside basketball team set four NCAA records with the new three-point shot during a 121–95 win over Lakeland College: most three-point shots completed by one player (14), most attempts by one team (70), most completions by one team (25) and most three-point attempts by both teams (77).

===1990s to present===
In March 1991, university officials traveled to Tbilisi, Georgia, to initiate an exchange agreement between UW–Parkside and the Georgian Technical University. Later in the year, Chancellor Kaplan and Vice Chancellor John Stockwell traveled to Ile-Ife, Nigeria to agree final details of an exchange agreement with Obafemi Awolowo University. In April 1991, a human-protein experiment coordinated by Associate Chemistry Professor Z. Richard Korszun launched into orbit aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Korszun invented a specialized device to &quot;grow&quot; crystallized human protein samples in the weightlessness of space, in the hope that the crystals will provide new information about the structure of proteins.

In September 1991, UW–Parkside baseball coach Ken Oberbruner, who compiled a 332–229 record as coach from 1970 to 1991, died. His son Jamey was inducted into the UW–Parkside Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995 for his baseball career from 1978 to 1981.

In July 1992, two UW–Parkside connected race walkers competed in the Summer Olympics in Barcelona; 1989 alumna Michelle Marter-Rohl finished 20th, and Debi Spino-Lawrence, a member of the university&#x27;s race walking team, finished 26th. Marter-Rohl went on to compete in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, finishing 14th in the 10k race, the best US finisher. In the fall of 1992, UW–Parkside history professor Thomas Reeves published &quot;A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy&quot;, which spent several weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Around the same time the university began hosting a national computer Olympics. Coordinated by math professor Donald Piele, the competition is used to pick the United States team to compete in the annual International Olympiad in Informatics. By 1998, UW–Parkside teams had won four gold medals, six silver medals and nine bronze medals.

In May 1993, the university awarded its first honorary doctor of humane letters degree to poet Gwendolyn Brooks. In May 1994, Chancellor Kaplan left the university to become president of the Metropolitan State University of Denver, and was succeeded by Eleanor J. Smith, vice president for academic affairs and provost at the William Paterson College of New Jersey. In 1994, in a project that grew from the university&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebration, the UW–Parkside Nature Trail was created, including 10 geological and historical markers around the nearly campus. The project later included a printed guide and signs marking more than 140 species of trees.

In May 1996, UW–Parkside was granted professional accreditation of its School of Business by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). In the Fall of that year, International Business Machines (IBM) donated an AS/400 computer worth $353,000 to UW–Parkside as part of a program to increase the number of employees with experience on the server. The computer was integrated into the management information systems curriculum in the Department of Business. Chancellor Smith resigned in May 1997 after three years in the post, and Gordon Lamb, president emeritus of Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago, was named interim chancellor by UW System President Katharine Lyall. The university&#x27;s fifth chancellor, John Keating, previously provost of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, began his tenure on July 1, 1998.

In the early years of the new millennium, UW–Parkside was one of 64 universities nationwide, and the only one in Wisconsin, to be designated as an &quot;engaged campus&quot; by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Keating stepped down as chancellor in 2008, but his named successor, Robert Felner, was asked to resign in Summer 2008 before he had taken over the position, as he was involved in a federal criminal investigation into possible misuse of funds, related to his time as dean of the University of Louisville&#x27;s College of Education and Human Development. The investigation included an FBI raid at UW–Parkside of the papers Felner was storing there in preparation for his new job. Lane R. Earns became UW–Parkside&#x27;s Interim Chancellor on August 25, 2008, and Deborah Ford became the university&#x27;s sixth chancellor on August 1, 2009.

===List of chancellors===
The university has had six chancellors: Irvin G. Wyllie (1966–74), Alan Guskin (1975–85), Sheila Kaplan (1986–93), Eleanor J. Smith (1994–97), John P. Keating (1998–2008), and Deborah L. Ford (2009–2023)

== Campus ==

UW–Parkside is a complex of buildings with the main academic buildings and its student center connected by skyways, where one walkway, that between the Student Center and Molinaro Hall, is nicknamed &quot;The Bridge.&quot; Nationally known architect Gyo Obata developed the campus master plan with a major library/learning center at its heart. The original buildings, constructed between 1967 and 1976, occupy a small portion of the campus, which lies in Kenosha County.

The campus comprises 15 buildings, including Wyllie Hall, Greenquist Hall, Molinaro Hall, Tallent Hall, the Rita Tallent Picken Regional Center for Arts and Humanities, the Student Center, the Sports &amp; Activity Center, Ranger Hall, University Apartments, and Pike River Suites. Recent renovations and expansions to the Sports &amp; Activity Center, Student Center, Rita Tallent Picken Regional Center for Arts and Humanities, and the newly constructed Pike River Suites blended the updates into the existing architecture.

The campus has hundreds of acres of restored prairies, mature oak and maple forests, and a meandering creek. The university also owns hundreds of acres of off-campus nature preserves in Kenosha and Racine Counties.

=== Rita Tallent Picken Regional Center for Arts and Humanities ===

The Rita Tallent Picken Regional Center for Arts and Humanities, also known as &quot;The Rita&quot;, underwent remodeling and expansion in 2012, with a goal of developing a creative and cultural hub for southeast Wisconsin with greater community access and new performance venues. The remodeling and expansion included a new music recital hall; a studio theater for smaller theater productions; galleries for art exhibitions; instructional studios for music, theater arts, and 2-D art programs; and expanded and upgraded classrooms.

The Rita houses the UW–Parkside Theatre Arts Department, which caps the company at approximately 65 students.

<text>The University of Wisconsin–Stout (UW–Stout or Stout) is a public university in Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States. The polytechnic university of the University of Wisconsin System, it enrolls more than 6,900 students. The school was founded in 1891 and named in honor of its founder, lumber magnate James Huff Stout.

UW–Stout provides focused programs &quot;related to professional careers in industry, technology, home economics, applied art, and the helping professions.&quot; UW–Stout offers more than 50 undergraduate majors and 22 graduate majors, including 2 advanced graduate majors and a doctorate.

==History==
In 1891, James Huff Stout, a lumber magnate who represented Menomonie in the Wisconsin State Senate, founded the Stout Manual Training School as a manual training school, the first of several educational enterprises he launched in Menomonie. The Manual Training movement was an educational philosophy that influenced modern vocational education. In the United States, this philosophy was established in the 1870s and used to train engineers, later working its way into public education. Manual training promoted a classical liberal education, but emphasizing practical application such as practical judgment, perception and visual accuracy, and manual dexterity over theory. It was not meant to be used to teach specific trades, but rather to enhance the traditional educational model. Students learned drafting, mechanics, woodworking, metal working, in addition to science, mathematics, language, literature, and history. After the American Civil War, leaders of industry and politics were turning to public education to augment existing apprenticeship programs by incorporating Manual Training philosophy into their curricula.

Stout was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, the philosophies of which influenced his own philosophy of education, specifically that making things by hand, through skill and creativity, would provide more thoughtful and creative consumer goods because of the personal satisfaction of the craftsperson. The American interpretation of the Arts and Crafts movement was not in opposition to modern industry. Rather, it embraced creativity and intellectual development as necessary components of the educational model, leading the school to teach classes in drawing, jewelry making, embroidery, and photography.

In addition to the Stout Manual Training School, James Huff Stout established kindergarten classes (1894), a Kindergarten Training School (1899), a School of Physical Culture (1901), training schools for manual training teachers and domestic science teachers (1903), and a Homemaker&#x27;s School (1907).

In 1908, to simplify and clarify administration, Stout merged his various educational enterprises into the Stout Institute, which was sold to the state of Wisconsin after Stout&#x27;s death in 1911. The school was governed by its own board of trustees until 1955, when it became part of the Wisconsin State Colleges system as Stout State College. The state colleges were all upgraded to university status in 1965, and accordingly Stout State College became Stout State University. In 1971, after the merger of the former University of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin State Universities, the school became part of the University of Wisconsin System under its present name, the University of Wisconsin–Stout. In March 2007, UW–Stout was designated &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s Polytechnic University&quot; by the UW System Board of Regents.

==Campus==

UW–Stout is made up of two parts, a main campus and north campus. The main campus has most classrooms, five of nine residence halls, and three dining facilities, while the north campus is the remaining four residence halls, along with one dining hall and the student health facilities. The campus is with 25 major academic and administrative buildings, 9 residence halls, and 245 laboratories.

More than 3,000 students live on campus. All freshmen and sophomores are required to live on campus for their first two academic years. Housing includes traditional dorms and modern suite-styled rooms. There are nine residence halls. All are co-ed.

The Stout Student Association is the student government representing all students at UW–Stout.

==Academics==
UW–Stout offers more than 50 undergraduate majors and 70 minors, along with 22 graduate degrees. The Graduate School provides oversight for graduate education at the university. UW–Stout offers three terminal degree programs; the Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) in Design, the Educational Specialist degree in both School Psychology and Career &amp; Technical Education, and the Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Career &amp; Technical Education.

UW–Stout is organized into two colleges: the College of Arts &amp; Human Sciences, which houses the School of Art &amp; Design and the School of Education; and the College of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics &amp; Management, which houses the Robert F. Cervenka School of Engineering and the School of Management.

The Graduate School provides oversight for graduate education at the university.

<text>The University of Wisconsin–Superior (UW–Superior or UWS) is a public liberal arts university in Superior, Wisconsin, United States. UW–Superior grants associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and specialist&#x27;s degrees. The university enrolls 2,559 undergraduates and 364 graduate students.

==History==
Originally named Superior Normal School, the university was founded by Wisconsin legislators as a school to train teachers in 1893. Superior Normal School&#x27;s first class graduated in 1897. In 1909, the institution became Wisconsin&#x27;s first normal school to offer a full-scale training program for the new idea of kindergarten. It also was the first to offer a four-year program for high school teachers beginning in 1923. After authorization to grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees in education in 1926, the school took on the new name of Superior State Teachers College. Graduate degrees were authorized in 1947 and first offered in 1950. In 1951 the state board of regents changed the institution&#x27;s name to Wisconsin State College–Superior to better reflect its expanding role. Wisconsin&#x27;s state colleges eventually were reclassified as universities, resulting in another name change in 1964 to Wisconsin State University–Superior. In 1971 Superior became part of the University of Wisconsin System and acquired its present name. To respond to cuts in state funding, in 2018 UW-Superior suspended a number of academic programs, claiming the cuts were in order to encourage more students to graduate on time.

The Promethean is the student newspaper for the University of Wisconsin–Superior. It began as &quot;The Peptomist&quot;, in 1920. Students voted to change the name to &quot;Promethean&quot; in 1974. The name was changed again at the start of the 2007–2008 academic year, to &quot;The Stinger&quot;. In fall 2009, it became primarily an online newspaper, publishing a print magazine compilation at the end of each term. In 2013, the newspaper returned to print, publishing bi-weekly. In 2015, the name returned to &quot;Promethean&quot;.

<text>In the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, an Outer Plane is one of a number of general types of planes of existence. They can also be referred to as &quot;godly planes&quot;, &quot;spiritual planes,&quot; or &quot;divine planes&quot;. The Outer Planes are home to beings such as deities and their servants such as demons, celestials and devils. Each Outer Plane is usually the physical manifestation of a particular moral and ethical alignment and the entities that dwell there often embody the traits related to that alignment.

The intangible and esoteric Outer Planes—the realms of ideals, philosophies, and gods—stand in contrast to the Inner Planes, which compose the material building blocks of reality and the realms of energy and matter.

All Outer Planes are spatially infinite but are composed of features and locations of finite scope. Many of these planes are often split into a collection of further infinites called &quot;layers&quot;, which are essentially sub-planes that represent one particular facet or theme of the plane. For example, Baator&#x27;s geography is reminiscent of Hell as depicted in Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. In addition, each layer may also contain a number of &quot;realms&quot;. Each realm is the home to an individual deity, and occasionally a collection of deities.
==Publication history==
The Outer Planes were presented for the first time in Volume 1, Number 8 of &quot;The Dragon&quot;, released July 1977 as part of the Great Wheel of Planes. In the article &quot;Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&amp;D&quot;, Gary Gygax mentions that there are 16 Outer Planes and describes the Seven Heavens, the Twin Paradises, and Elysium as &quot;Typical higher planes&quot;, Nirvana as the &quot;plane of ultimate Law&quot; and Limbo as the &quot;plane of ultimate Chaos (entropy)&quot;, and the Nine Hells, Hades&#x27; three glooms, and the 666 layers of the Abyss as &quot;Typical lower planes&quot;. Other Outer Planes mentioned by name in the article include the Happy Hunting Grounds, Olympus, Gladsheim, Pandemonium, Tarterus, Gehenna, Acheron, and Arcadia.

The Outer Planes were further &quot;refined in the &quot;Players Handbook&quot; (1978) and &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; (1980)&quot;. The appendix of the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; included an abstract diagram of the planes, and mentioned the same 16 Outer Planes: the Seven Heavens of absolute lawful good, the Twin Paradises of neutral good lawfuls, the planes of Elysium of absolute neutral good, the Happy Hunting Grounds of neutral good chaotics, the planes of Olympus of good chaotics, the planes of Gladsheim (Asgard, Valhalla, Vanaheim, etc.) of chaotic good neutrals, the planes of Limbo of neutral (absolute) chaos (entropy), the Planes of Pandemonium of chaotic evil neutrals, the 666 layers of the Abyss of absolute chaotic evil, the planes of Tarterus of evil chaotic neutrals, Hades&#x27; &quot;Three Glooms&quot; of absolute (neutral) evil, the furnaces of Gehenna of lawful evil neutrals, the Nine Hells of absolute lawful evil, the nether planes of Acheron of lawful evil neutrals, Nirvana of absolute (neutral) lawfuls, and the planes of Arcadia of neutral good lawfuls. Shannon Appelcline, the author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, highlighted that throughout the early 1980s &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine would continue to detail &quot;some of the planes in more depth&quot;, however, &quot;there was no overarching plan for the planes of D&amp;D other than a few increasingly old drawings&quot;.

Both Appelcline and Curtis D. Carbonell, in his book the &quot;Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic&quot;, highlighted that information on the planes and the shared cosmology was codified in the &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (1987) and &quot;Tales of the Outer Planes&quot; (1988). Carbonell wrote that project leader and designer Jeff Grubb detailed &quot;the schematization of the planes&#x27; requisite five area: the Prime Material, the Ethereal, the Astral, the Inner, and the Outer planes. This basic structure is still used in 5e, with some changes that provide minor rearrangements and clarifications [...]. Grubb&#x27;s approach demonstrated a need to codify, while still remaining flexible, that has remained as a primary aim of the latest edition&quot;.

Carbonell also highlighted that the 1989 Spelljammer campaign setting added cosmology that &quot;allowed travel between the different settings&quot; such as &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, and the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. However, campaign settings such as &quot;Dark Sun&quot; and &quot;Ravenloft&quot; were inaccessible in this cosmology. Then in 1993, TSR wanted to do a series of books about the Outer Planes. Zeb Cook, creator of the Planescape universe, describes it this way: So there was this huge collection of over ten years of stuff that was just kind of quietly ignored with no sense of logic to it, and we figured that &#x27;Oh, we don&#x27;t need to explain it—it&#x27;s enough to say &quot;It came from The Outer Planes. So [one of the TSR designers] said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do this series of books, one about each Plane,&#x27; which would have been about 10 million books, so TSR said, &#x27;Well, that&#x27;s a good idea, but 10 million books is not such a great idea. We&#x27;d rather create a campaign world that&#x27;s set in the Outer Planes,&#x27; because they had figured out by that point that worlds sold. And so they came to me, the senior designer with a huge gaping hole in my schedule, and wanted me to take this idea and execute it. &#x27;Make us a campaign world that&#x27;s completely different from all of the ones we have...&#x27;Carbonell called the 1994 Planescape campaign setting &quot;the most complex example of the multiverse created during the varieties of 2e&#x27;s AD&amp;D settings&quot; and wrote: &quot;A more nuanced and sophisticated attempt at harmonization, Planescape provided an alternate way to travel between the planes than Spelljammer&#x27;s science-fantasy-oriented approach&quot;. The 3rd edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2001) detailed both the inner and outer planes. Kevin Kulp, for DMs Guild, wrote that &quot;the authors used an approach that said &#x27;here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s been done in the past, and here are other ways you can do it,&#x27; which allowed the book to avoid setting planar mechanics in stone. Instead it gave DMs a modular approach by presenting Options, a flexible strategy that pleased both 1e and Planescape fans. Vast amounts of new ideas and new locations were presented, dovetailing nicely with canon from earlier editions&quot;.

The 4th edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2008) shifted the locations of the various Outer Planes to fit the new World Axis cosmology. However, the 5th edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014) and &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2014) shifted most of the cosmology of the planes back to the Great Wheel model with some aspects of the World Axis model retained in the descriptions of the inner planes.

==Standard &quot;D&amp;D&quot; cosmology==

The standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) cosmology contains sixteen Outer Planes. This cosmology is outlined in the Great Wheel model where the Outer Planes are arranged in a ring of sixteen planes with the Good-aligned planes (or &quot;Upper Planes&quot;) at the top, and the Evil-aligned planes (or &quot;Lower Planes&quot;) at the bottom. Depictions usually display the Lawful planes (or Planes of Law) to the left, and the Chaotic planes (or Planes of Chaos) to the right. Between all of these sit the Neutral planes, or the Planes of Conflict. The center contains the Inner and Material Planes.

One further plane sits in the center of the ring, the Outlands, being neutral in alignment. At the center of the Outlands is a Spire of infinite height; the city of Sigil floats above the Spire&#x27;s pinnacle.

This D&amp;D cosmology is the standard cosmology in the 3rd and 5th Editions and is the official cosmology used in campaign settings such as &quot;Planescape&quot; and &quot;Greyhawk&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s common for gods from different campaign settings to share a plane but maintain their own space. Mount Celestia, for example, houses both Heironeous from Greyhawk and Torm from the Forgotten Realms&quot;. Many of the alternative names derive from the 1st-edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (1987), and the in-game explanation given in the Planescape setting is that these names are used by the &quot;Clueless&quot;, or characters from the Prime Material unfamiliar with the planes.

===4th Edition differences===
The 4th Edition World Axis model outlines that the mortal world is between &quot;the Astral Sea above and the Elemental Chaos below&quot;. Most of the Outer Planes are now located in the Astral Sea (such as Celestia and the Nine Hells). The Abyss is an exception; it is now located in the Elemental Chaos.

== Cosmology in campaign settings ==
Other &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; cosmologies were developed after Greyhawk for various other campaign settings, however, &quot;they would be subsumed under 5e&#x27;s umbrella concept of the multiverse&quot;.

===Forgotten Realms cosmology===
The &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; cosmology was originally the same as that of a standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign. The cosmology for the 3rd edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; was altered substantially so that it contained twenty-six Outer Planes, arranged in a tree-like structure around the central &#x27;trunk&#x27; of the material plane of Toril. Unlike the Outer Planes of the standard D&amp;D cosmology which were heavily alignment-based, the Outer Planes of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; cosmology were faith-based.

The planes of the Forgotten Realms were retooled in the 4th Edition to match the new default cosmology, with many of the planes or realms being relocated to the Astral Sea, and a handful now located in the Elemental Chaos. Appelcline highlighted that the 4th Edition World Axis model &quot;had actually originated with the Forgotten Realms, which was planning a view of the heavens as early as 2005 or 2006. It was then co-opted by the SCRAMJET world design team for D&amp;D 4e&quot;.

The Barrens of Doom and Despair plane is designed to be inhospitable to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; player characters. Even though there is little light or water, other characters from the franchise can be found here. Five deities make their homes here, including Bane (his home was previously referred to as Acheron), Beshaba, Hoar, Loviatar, and Talona. The Barrens of Doom and Despair consist of a single infinite plane, with no constituent layers. It links via the Astral Plane to the planes of the Prime Material (such as Toril) and a number of portals directly connect it with Hammergrim and the Blood Rift. Beshaba&#x27;s realm, the Blood Tor, links directly to the Abyss.

=== Eberron cosmology ===

The &quot;Eberron&quot; cosmology, used in the original &quot;Eberron&quot; campaign setting, contained thirteen Outer Planes in 3rd edition, and gained at least two for 4th edition under the new cosmology. They exhibit traits similar to those of the &quot;standard D&amp;D cosmology&quot; but also some (Irian, Mabar, Fernia, and Risia) appear more like Inner Planes. The cosmology was unique in that the Outer Planes orbited around Eberron through the Astral plane. As they orbited, their overlap with the material plane changed and access to those planes became easier or restricted.

Like most other D&amp;D campaign settings, in 3rd edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Eberron has a number of planes. Besides the Prime Material Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Plane of Shadow, and the Astral Plane, the Eberron Campaign Setting has thirteen relatively unique planes. Gates or portals to any of the planes are very rare. These thirteen planes metaphysically orbit around Eberron, and depending on their current location are considered in one of four states.
* Waxing/Waning – The plane is either approaching or moving away from Eberron. Planar travel occurs as normal.
* Coterminous – The plane actually touches Eberron, and certain effects are strengthened in Eberron. Also, it may be possible to travel between planes by going to an appropriate spot. For example, when Risia, the Plain of Ice is coterminous, one may enter the plane from Eberron by walking into a blizzard. Because of seals placed by the Gatekeeper druids, Xoriat, the Realm of Madness, is incapable of becoming coterminous with Eberron.
* Remote – The plane is furthest from Eberron, and certain effects are weakened in Eberron. Also, reaching a remote plane with the spell &quot;plane shift&quot; is difficult and requires a high DC check. Because of the conflict between the Quori and the giants of Xen&#x27;drik, Dal Quor is always considered remote from Eberron.

==Fictional descriptions==
=== List of planes ===
===Abyss===
The Abyss is known for having hundreds of layers, and many realms of deities and demons, including its horrific first layer of Pazunia (also known as the Plane of Infinite Portals), and the White Kingdom ruled by the King of Ghouls.

In a critical review of &quot;Planes of Chaos&quot; for &quot;White Wolf Inphobia&quot; magazine, Keith H. Eisenbeis described the danger of adventuring in planes such as the Abyss, especially for low- and mid-level characters: &quot;Sure, it&#x27;s possible to design a situation in which first-level characters can accomplish something important and survive in the Abyss, but the immensity and power of the planes is undermined. In addition, on planes such as the Abyss, negotiating with evil creatures is frequently necessary, possibly making these planes useful to only neutral and evil characters.&quot;

Ken Denmead of &quot;Wired&quot; described a number of aspects of the Abyss as psychedelic, calling the doors on one layer of the Abyss similar to the &quot;loony corridor scene from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Heart Club Band&quot;.&quot;

===Acheron===
Acheron ( ), also known as The Infernal Battlefield of Acheron, is a lawful neutral/lawful evil–aligned plane of existence.

===Arborea===
Arborea or more fully, the Olympian Glades of Arborea, is a chaotic good-aligned plane of existence. It is one of a number of alignment-based Outer Planes that form part of the standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;(D&amp;D)&quot; cosmology, used in the &quot;Planescape&quot;, &quot;Greyhawk&quot; and some editions of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign settings.

Arborea is also referred to as &quot;Olympus&quot; or &quot;Arvandor&quot;, though technically those names describe separate realms within the plane. Arborea is stylised as a peaceful plane of natural beauty with a multitude of thriving environments. Much of the plane is dominated by vast tall forests, but also includes glades of wildflowers and fields of grain. As a plane that also embodies chaos, it has a wild and often sudden nature. The weather can change drastically at short notice, changing from warm sunshine to raging winds and back again in just a few minutes.

====Publication history====
The plane known as Olympus was mentioned for the first time by name in the article &quot;Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&amp;D&quot;, in &quot;The Dragon&quot; #8, released July 1977. The plane was mentioned again in an appendix of the known planes of existence in the original (1st edition) AD&amp;D &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, published in June 1978, where it was described as &quot;The planes of Olympus of absolute good chaotics&quot;.

The eladrin, powerful elf-like celestial creatures are the protectors of Arborea, the most common of which is the &quot;Ghaele&quot;. Lillends are also common on the plane. Many types of celestial and anarchic version of common animals, natural creatures suffused with tendencies of good or chaos, are found in Arborea. Also, primitive Orc-Baboon hybrids known as Losels dwell in its wilderness, occasionally migrating between it and the Beastlands.

Arborea has two main types of petitioner, the first of which are the spirits of the elven dead. Some take the form of celestial creatures or others simply merge with the plane itself, as a final reward after death. The second main type are the bacchae, drunken revellers who perpetually indulge in wild celebrations, enticing visitors to join with them.

====Structure====
As an outer plane, Arborea is spatially infinite, further consisting of three infinite layers (or sub-planes). Arborea&#x27;s first layer shares borders with the neighbouring planes of the Heroic Domains of Ysgard and the Wilderness of the Beastlands; travel is possible between Arborea and these planes at certain locations.

====Layers====
The wandering realm of the Seelie Court often appears on the plane of Arborea, always in a different location.

Arborea has three layers:

;Arvandor/Olympus
In previous editions, this layer was known as Olympus, but the most recent edition of &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; refers to it only as Arvandor. Principally, it is the home plane of the Seldarine, the good Elven deities, headed by Corellon Larethian. This layer is mostly endless canopies of forest with huge clearings containing many idealized elven settlements. Arvandor has a day and night cycle matching that of the material plane. The goddess Eilistraee also resides in the forests of Arvandor, despite her banishment.

The realm of &quot;Brightwater&quot;, a separate plane in the third edition &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; cosmology is located on Arvandor. Four goddesses have domains here, including Lliira, Sharess, Sune, and Tymora.

The actual realm of &quot;Olympus&quot; is found here, and is home to many deities of the Greek pantheon, including Zeus, Aphrodite, Apollo, Ares, Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Hera, Hermes, and the titan Rhea.

There are several other realms located on this layer, including: 
*The aarakocra goddess Syranita&#x27;s realm of &quot;Whistledge&quot;; 
*The giant goddess Iallanis&#x27;s realm of &quot;Florallium&quot;; 
*Trithereon&#x27;s realm of &quot;The Forking Road&quot;; 
*Chih-Nii&#x27;s realm of &quot;Loom of the Celestial River&quot;.

;Aquallor/Ossa
When not with the Seldarine, Deep Sashelas also has his own realm of &quot;Elavandor&quot; on Ossa.

Poseidon&#x27;s realm of &quot;Caletto&quot; can be found on Ossa.

;Mithardir/Pelion
Nephthys has her realm of &quot;Amun-thys&quot; on Pelion.

====Historic influences====
Arborea incorporates many elements of Greek mythology, with the game&#x27;s version of Mount Olympus as a central feature, to the point that the whole plane was originally named Olympus in 1st edition. The name of Arborea, introduced in 2nd edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, is derived from its &quot;endless rolling forests&quot;, as in arboreal.

===Arcadia===
Arcadia ( ) or more fully, the Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia, is a lawful neutral/lawful good-aligned plane of existence.

===Baator===
Baator, also known as the Nine Hells of Baator or the Nine Hells, is a lawful evil–aligned plane of existence.

Baator is stylised as a plane of sinister evil and cruelty. The different types of devils that dwell here obey a strict hierarchical caste-like social structure. Each continually plots to advance their position through treachery and deception. Unlike the demons of the Abyss, the devils are highly organized, with a logical and calculating nature.

The plane itself is composed of nine different layers, each of which models a differing but no less inhospitable and dreadful environment, from barren plains of ash and rock to frozen wastes of endless ice.

The nine layers in order are Avernus, Dis, Minauros, Phlegethos, Stygia, Malbolge, Maladomini, Cania and Nessus.

====Publication history====
The plane known as the Nine Hells was mentioned for the first time by name in the article &quot;Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&amp;D&quot;, in &quot;The Dragon&quot; #8, released July 1977. In the article Gary Gygax describes the plane as one of the &quot;Typical lower planes&quot;. The plane was mentioned again in an appendix of the known planes of existence in the original (1st edition) AD&amp;D &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, published in June 1978, where it was described as &quot;The Nine Hells of absolute lawful evil&quot;.

====History====
The article &quot;The Politics of Hell&quot; by Alexander Von Thorn in &quot;Dragon&quot; No. 28 (1979) describes how Hell was originally ruled by Satan, who was usurped by Baalzebul, who was in turn overthrown by Asmodeus.

The article &quot;The Possessors&quot; by Arn Ashleigh Parker in &quot;Dragon&quot; No. 42 (October 1980) follows up on this article by explaining that Selm, a lieutenant of Satan, was made the Prince of Possessors, and remained in that position throughout these various changes in the administration in Hell.

===Beastlands===
The Beastlands (more properly, the Wilderness of the Beastlands, formerly the Happy Hunting Grounds in early versions of the game) is a neutral (chaotic) good-aligned plane of existence.

===Bytopia===
Bytopia, also known as the Twin Paradises, &quot;(bi- + utopia)&quot; or, more fully, the Twin Paradises of Bytopia, is a lawful good/neutral good aligned plane of existence. It is one of a number of alignment-based Outer Planes that form part of the standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;(D&amp;D)&quot; cosmology, used in the &quot;Planescape&quot;, &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, and some editions of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign settings. Bytopia is a virtuous plane of cultivated beauty, and is home to many of the deities of the gnomish pantheon.

====Publication history====
The plane known as the Twin Paradises was mentioned for the first time by name in the article &quot;Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&amp;D&quot;, in &quot;The Dragon&quot; #8, released July 1977. In the article Gary Gygax describes the plane as one of the &quot;Typical higher planes&quot;. The plane was mentioned again in an appendix of the known planes of existence in the original (1st edition) AD&amp;D &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, published in June 1978, where it was described as &quot;The Twin Paradises of neutral good lawfuls&quot;.

====Structure====
Bytopia is a spatially infinite plane, consisting of two layers or sub-planes. It is unique in the sense that the two layers are laid facing one another, each looking down (or up; the terms are relative here) at the other. A traveller can look up from one layer and see the other above him looking back down (or, from the other side&#x27;s perspective, up), provided that the sky is clear. To get from one layer to the other, travellers must either climb tall mountains, or fly. Gravity reverses when someone reaches the middle point between the two layers. Bytopia shares its borders with the neighbouring planes of the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia and the Blessed Fields of Elysium; travel is possible between Bytopia and these planes at certain locations.

Dothion is a serene pastoral layer of meadows and wild-flowers; it is home to the souls of farmers, craftsmen, honest merchants, and gnomish commoners. &quot;The Golden Hills&quot;, a separate plane in the 3rd-Edition Forgotten Realms cosmology, is located here, and is home to the gnome deity Garl Glittergold, as well as Baervan Wildwanderer, Baravar Cloakshadow, Flandal Steelskin, Gaerdal Ironhand, Nebelun the Meddler, and Segojan Earthcaller. Flandal shares his &quot;Mithral Forge&quot; with Ama-Tsu-Mara. The godly realms of &quot;Deephome&quot;, home of Callarduran Smoothhands, god of the svirfneblin, and &quot;Prosperity&quot;, realm of Inari, are also located on Dothion.

Shurrock is the mountainous untamed twin, home of hidden beasts and monsters. The gnomish underground mining city of &quot;Quarry&quot; that specialises in gemcutting is located here. Rangers often foray into this wilderness to slay creatures that have threatened the folk of Dothion.

A number of godly realms exist on this layer, including &quot;Heart of Justice&quot;, realm of Kiri-Jolith, and &quot;Windwrath&quot;, realm of Tefnut. &quot;Martyrdomain&quot; was the realm of Ilmater in previous editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

===Carceri===
Carceri (more fully, the Tarterian Depths of Carceri; also, Tarterus or The Red Prison) is a neutral (chaotic) evil-aligned plane of existence.

===Elysium===
Elysium, or more fully, the Blessed Fields of Elysium, is a strongly good-aligned plane of existence.

===Gehenna===
Gehenna (beginning in the third edition of the game, the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna; also, The Fourfold Furnaces or The Fires of Perdition) is a plane of existence of neutral evil/lawful evil alignment. It is one of a number of alignment-based Outer Planes that form part of the standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;(D&amp;D)&quot; cosmology. It borders the Gray Waste of Hades and the Nine Hells of Baator.

===Gray Waste of Hades===
The Gray Waste (more fully, the Gray Wastes of Hades; also, Hades, The Three Glooms, Hope&#x27;s Loss or The Nadir) is a strongly neutral evil aligned plane of existence. It is one of a number of alignment-based Outer Planes that form part of the standard &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) cosmology, used in the &quot;Planescape&quot;, &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, and some editions of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign settings. Hades is the plane of origin of the yugoloth daemons. Pathfinder&#x27;s analogue to Hades is the plane called &quot;Abaddon&quot; (from the Hebraic &quot;Abaddon&quot;).

====Publication history====
The plane known as Hades was mentioned for the first time by name in the article &quot;Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&amp;D&quot;, in &quot;The Dragon&quot; #8, released July 1977. In the article Gary Gygax describes the plane as Hades&#x27; three glooms, one of the &quot;Typical lower planes&quot;. The plane was mentioned again in an appendix of the known planes of existence in the original (1st edition) AD&amp;D &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, published in June 1978, where it was described as &quot;Hades&#x27; &quot;Three Glooms&quot; of absolute (neutral) evil&quot;.

====Description====
According to Trenton Webb&#x27;s critical review of &quot;Planes of Conflict&quot; for British RPG magazine &quot;Arcane&quot;, the Gray Waste &quot;erodes the sense of purpose that is the hallmark of an alignment-based philosophy. One symptom of this is the place&#x27;s ability to fade the colour from a character&#x27;s clothes!&quot; Stang and Trammell called Hades &quot;the realm of the dead&quot;, where larvae created by night hags are used as currency.

===Limbo===
Limbo or more fully, the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, is a chaotic neutral-aligned plane of existence.

The plane known as Limbo was mentioned for the first time by name in the article &quot;Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&amp;D&quot;, in &quot;The Dragon&quot; #8, released July 1977. In the article Gary Gygax describes the plane as the &quot;plane of ultimate Chaos (entropy)&quot;. The plane was mentioned again in an appendix of the known planes of existence in the original &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, published in June 1978, where it was described as &quot;The planes of Limbo of neutral (absolute) chaos (entropy)&quot;.

Limbo is described as a place of pure chaos where everything is in constant motion and change, especially the landscape, which can shift unpredictably and randomly rolls over upon itself like liquid. Very few places in Limbo are stable enough for normal travel.

Limbo is home to the slaadi and their lords (most notably Ygorl and Ssendam), and to the githzerai. Very few gods call Limbo home, as the plane is not well-suited to any sort of permanent structures. The shared realm of Tempus and the Red Knight can be found on Limbo, as can Shaundakul&#x27;s realm. The elven god Fenmarel Mestarine calls this chaotic plane home as well.

The plane of Limbo is the location of a number of godly realms:
*The elven god Fenmarel Mestarine&#x27;s realm of &quot;Fennimar&quot;.
*Indra, Vayu, and Agni&#x27;s realm of &quot;Swarga&quot;.
*Llerg&#x27;s realm of &quot;Beasthaven&quot;.
*Procan&#x27;s realm of &quot;Seasedge&quot;.
*Ralishaz&#x27;s realm of &quot;The Kiss of Luck&quot;.
*Shaundakul&#x27;s realm of &quot;Shaunadaur&quot;.
*Shina-Tsu-Hiko&#x27;s realm of &quot;Windshome&quot;.
*Sirrion&#x27;s realm of &quot;The Flame Void&quot;.
*Tempus and the Red Knight&#x27;s shared realm of &quot;Knight&#x27;s Rest&quot;.
*Susanoo&#x27;s realm of &quot;The Globe of Raging Chaos&quot;.

Fauna include the Chaos dragon.

Limbo is named after the Limbo of Catholic mythology, where the souls of the dead who died before Jesus&#x27;s death went, before he descended there to release them, but there is little similarity of philosophy between the two realms. In appearance, it is based on the Abyss in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

===Mechanus===
Mechanus, also known as The Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus (or simply Nirvana in AD&amp;D 1st Edition) is a purely lawful aligned plane of existence.

===Mount Celestia===
Mount Celestia or more fully, the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia, or even the Seven Heavens is a lawful good-aligned plane of existence.

The seven layers in order are Lunia, Mercuria, Venya, Solania, Mertion, Jovar, and Chronias.

===Outlands===
The Concordant Domain of the Outlands, also known as the Concordant Opposition, is the Outer Plane where the souls of people of Neutral alignment are sent after death. It is popular as a meeting place for treaties between the powers. The Outlands are also home to the gate-towns. Located centrally in the Outlands is the Spire, atop which Sigil can be seen. The Outlands are the home plane of the neutral-minded rilmani. The Outlands are part of a series of rings that form the multiverse. Travel between the planes of the Outlands is accomplished via The Great Road.

In first edition and second edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; before Planescape, this plane is also located centrally to the Outer Planes and known by its original name Concordant Opposition. The First Edition Manual Of Planes states that the center of the plane takes various forms at different times (a mountain, a huge tree, etc.) and godly powers are lost as one moves toward the center, as well as spells, beginning with the highest levels of spells at the farthest out and then gradually losing the lower ones step by step the further one moves inward. Within of the center, not even chemical reactions take place, and neither man nor deity can get closer than . In Second Edition Outer Planes Monstrous Compendium, under the description of the Mediators of Nirvana (Mechanus), it states that this plane was originally intended for Neutral Powers (deities) and created by the Powers (deities) of creation, but each Neutral Deity asserted their individual influence causing it to become unbalanced, then were cast out by the powers of creation. It also states that three lights of balance exist at the center of the plane, one for each Mediator in Nirvana. (Mechanus) Before Planescape, there is also no mention whatsoever of Sigil being at the Center of the Plane.

Gate-towns are settlements which are built around a permanent portal to a certain Outer Plane on the Great Wheel. Gate-towns are important strategically because they provide a (relatively) stable way to enter a desired Outer Plane. The gate-towns reflect the plane that they lead to, for example, Xaos (or aXos, soaX, etc.) is a town where everything changes from one moment to the next. Even the location of the portal to Limbo changes every day – not that there&#x27;s any regularity to daybreak and nightfall in Xaos. The character of Xaos mirrors what the plane of Limbo is like.

====Realms====
The Outlands is the location of a number of godly realms, including the following:

* &quot;The Caverns of Thought&quot;, realm of the illithid deity Ilsensine
* &quot;The Court of Light&quot;, realm of the naga deity Shekinester
* &quot;The Flowering Hill&quot;, the realm of the halfling goddess Sheela Peryroyl
* &quot;Gzemnid&#x27;s Realm&quot;, home of the beholder deity of gases and vapors
* &quot;The Hidden Realm&quot;, home of the chief giant deity Annam
* &quot;The Hidden Vale&quot;, realm of the Dragonlance god Gilean
* &quot;The Hidden Wood&quot;, realm of the nature god Obad-Hai
* &quot;The Library of Lore&quot;, realm of the god Boccob
* &quot;The Mausoleum of Chronepsis&quot;, realm of the dragon deity Chronepsis
* &quot;The Marketplace Eternal&quot;, realm of the god Zilchus
* &quot;The Palace of Judgement&quot;, Yen-Wang-Yeh&#x27;s realm
* &quot;The Scales of Wealth&quot;, the realm of Shinare
* &quot;Semuanya&#x27;s Bog&quot;, realm of the lizardfolk deity Semuanya
* &quot;The Steel Hills&quot;, realm of the goddess Ulaa
* &quot;Thoth&#x27;s Estate&quot;, the realm of Thoth
* &quot;Tvashtri&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, realm of the Indian god of artifice
* &quot;The Web of Fate&quot;, realm of the goddess Istus
* &quot;The Well of Urd&quot;, realm of the Norns
* &quot;Wonderhome&quot;, realm of Gond

Three dwarven gods, (Vergadain, Dugmaren Brightmantle, and Dumathoin) share the realm of &quot;The Dwarven Mountain&quot; on the plane of the Outlands.

The Celtic gods (Daghdha, Diancecht, Goibhniu, Lugh, Manannan mac Lir, Oghma, and Silvanus) share the realm of Tír na nÓg on the Outlands.

===Pandemonium===
Pandemonium (or, the Windswept Depths of Pandemonium) is the Outer plane where Chaotic Evil and Chaotic Neutral petitioners are sent after death. Pandemonium is a large, complex cavern that never ends. Compounding this problem, howling winds drive most of its residents mad. There are few creatures that are native to this plane; those individuals who do live there usually have no choice in the matter.

Pandemonium had four layers named Pandesmos, Cocytus, Phlegethon and Agathion.

===Ysgard===
Ysgard is the Outer Plane of Chaotic Neutral / Chaotic Good alignment. It is also called &quot;Asgard&quot;, &quot;Gladsheim&quot; or &quot;The Heroic Domains&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Backstab&quot; magazine reviewer Lord Winfield characterized the Outer Planes as the place where most of the major powers of the setting are found, and the part of Planescape which has the most potential for exploration by the player characters.

<text>Blenny (from the Greek and , mucus, slime) is a common name for many types of fish, including several families of percomorph marine, brackish, and some freshwater fish sharing similar morphology and behaviour. Six families are considered &quot;true blennies&quot;, grouped under the order Blenniiformes; its members are referred to as blenniiformids. About 151 genera and nearly 900 species have been described within the order. The order was formerly classified as a suborder of the Perciformes but the 5th Edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; divided the Perciformes into a number of new orders and the Blenniiformes were placed in the percomorph clade Ovalentaria alongside the such taxa as Cichliformes, Mugiliformes and Gobiesociformes.

== Families ==
The six &quot;true blenny&quot; families are:

* Blenniidae - combtooth blennies, including the sabre-toothed blennies
* Chaenopsidae - pikeblennies, tubeblennies and flagblennies
* Clinidae - clinids, including the giant kelpfish
* Dactyloscopidae - sand stargazers
* Labrisomidae 
* Tripterygiidae - threefin blennies

== Similarities with other families ==
The blenniiformids are superficially quite similar to members of the goby and dragonet families, as well as several other unrelated families whose members have occasionally been given the name &quot;blenny&quot;. Many blennies demonstrate mimicry of other species, such as &quot;Aspidontus taeniatus&quot;. This mimicry allows the blenny to get up close to fish that would normally let &quot;Labroides dimidiatus&quot; (the bluestreak cleaner wrasse), clean them. The blenny then takes nips or larger bites out of the unsuspecting fish. There are two genera of blennies that demonstrate Batesian mimicry - &quot;Ecsenius&quot; and &quot;Plagiotremus&quot;.

== Morphology ==
Blenniformids are generally small fish, only occasionally reaching lengths up to 55 cm, with elongated bodies (some almost eel-like), and relatively large eyes and mouths. Their dorsal fins are often continuous and long; the pelvic fins typically have a single embedded spine and are short and slender, situated before the pectoral fins. The tail fin is rounded. The blunt heads of blenniiformids often possess elaborate whisker-like structures called cirri.

== Behavior and feeding ==
As generally benthic fish, blenniiformids spend much of their time on or near the sea floor; many are reclusive and may burrow in sandy substrates or inhabit crevices in reefs, the lower stretches of rivers, or even empty mollusc shells. Some blennies, otherwise known as &quot;rock-hoppers&quot;, leap from the water onto rocks in order to reach other pools.

As far as predation, blennies depend on a secretive lifestyle, hiding on the sea floors in shallow water, with cryptic coloration.

== Venom ==
For protection, there is only one genus that is truly venomous, namely &quot;Meiacanthus&quot;. These fish can inject venom from their mandibular, hollow fangs. They have venom that contains the opioid-like enkephalin, phospholipase, and neuropeptide Y.

== Distribution ==
True blennies are widely distributed in coastal waters, often abundant and easily observed which has made them the subject for many studies of ecology and behaviour. Two of the families, the Blennidae and the Tripterygiidae have global distributions, the Clinidae have a mainly temperate distribution and the remaining three families are largely Neotropical. This distribution makes these fish ideal subjects for studies of biogeography. It is thought that the splitting of the Tethys Sea by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama combined with Pliocene warming of the climate may have been important factors influencing the evolution and biogeography of the Blenniiformes.

<text>Ramona Victoria Epifanía Rufina Ocampo (7 April 1890 – 27 January 1979) was an Argentine writer and intellectual. Best known as an advocate for others and as publisher of the literary magazine &quot;Sur&quot;, she was also a writer and critic in her own right and one of the most prominent South American women of her time. Her sister was Silvina Ocampo, also a writer. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature on 1970 and 1974.

==Biography==

Born Ramona Victoria Epifanía Rufina Ocampo in Buenos Aires into a high-society family, she was educated at home by a French governess. She later wrote: &quot;the alphabet-book in which I learned to read was French, as was the hand that taught me to draw those first letters.&quot;

She is sometimes said to have attended the Sorbonne: on page 39 of her biography of Ocampo, Doris Meyer states that, during the family&#x27;s 1906–1907 trip to Paris, the same during which she was etched by Paul César Helleu, the Ocampos allowed 17-year-old Victoria, &quot;well-chaperoned,&quot; to audit some lectures at the Sorbonne and at the Collège de France. She remembered particularly enjoying Henri Bergson&#x27;s lectures at the latter. She never matriculated at either. Her old traditional wealthy family frowned on formal education for women, so she had little. In 1912, Ocampo married Bernando de Estrada (also known as Monaco Estrada). The marriage was not happy; the couple separated in 1920, and Ocampo began a long–lasting affair with her husband&#x27;s cousin Julián Martínez, a diplomat.

In Buenos Aires, she was a lynchpin of the intellectual scene of the 1920s and 1930s. Her first book, written in French, was &quot;De Francesca à Beatrice&quot; ( 1923), a commentary on Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Other works include &quot;Domingos en Hyde Park&quot;; &quot;El Hamlet de Laurence Olivier&quot;; &quot;Emily Brontë (Terra incógnita)&quot;; a series called &quot;Testimonios&quot; (ten volumes); &quot;Virginia Woolf, Orlando y Cía&quot;; &quot;San Isidro&quot;; &quot;338171 T.E. (Lawrence of Arabia)&quot;–a biography of T. E. Lawrence–and a posthumously published autobiography. There is also an edited book of dialogues between Ocampo and Jorge Luis Borges.

Ocampo corresponded with Virginia Woolf throughout 1930s; the two writers met multiple times, and their friendship ended in London in June 1939 when Ocampo invited a photographer friend, Gisele Freund, to take Woolf&#x27;s picture, who famously disliked appearing in photographs.

Perhaps of greater significance than her own writing, she was founder (1931) and publisher of the magazine &quot;Sur&quot;, the most important literary magazine of its time in Latin America. Among the writers published in &quot;Sur&quot; were Borges, Ernesto Sabato, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Julio Cortázar, José Ortega y Gasset, Manuel Peyrou, Albert Camus, Enrique Anderson Imbert, José Bianco, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada, Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, Waldo Frank, Gabriela Mistral, Eduardo Mallea, and her own younger sister Silvina Ocampo.

In 1935, Ocampo expressed some approval for Benito Mussolini with whom she was granted an interview in March of that year in Rome, hailing him then as a &quot;genius&quot; and Caesar reborn. &quot;I have seen Italy in blossom turn its face towards him.&quot; However, she was never a convinced fascist sympathizer, and expressed disapproval of Mussolini&#x27;s conservative views on gender roles and the regime&#x27;s growing militarism. By the time her interview with Mussolini was published in August 1936, Italy had invaded Abyssinia and Ocampo appended a note to it declaring that any hope that the fascist regime might improve was lost and criticized those in Argentina who supported Italy&#x27;s belligerence.

In 1937, Ocampo and the editors of &quot;Sur&quot; came out openly against fascism and definitively linked the journal with liberalism. During the Spanish Civil War, the magazine sided with the Republicans. She supported and edited from Argentina, in collaboration with her friend and translator Pelegrina Pastorino, the anti-Nazi magazine &quot;Les Lettres Francaises&quot;, directed by Roger Caillois; and in 1946 she was the only Argentine who attended the Nuremberg Trials. A few months before World War II, in 1939, Ocampo was appointed to the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, but did not participate in its works. In 1953, she was briefly imprisoned for her open opposition to the government of Juan Domingo Perón.

Ocampo was made a member of the Argentine Academy of Letters in 1976. She was the first woman ever admitted to the Academy, and she formally took her seat on 23 June 1977. The &quot;cultural dialog,&quot; initiated in 1977 by the &quot;de facto&quot; government but organized by UNESCO, was held in her home, Villa Ocampo, in San Isidro, Buenos Aires Province; she eventually donated the house to UNESCO in 1973.

At Villa Ocampo, her guests included Igor Stravinsky, André Malraux and Rabindranath Tagore, also Indira Gandhi, José Ortega y Gasset, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Saint-John Perse, Ernest Ansermet and Rafael Alberti. Graham Greene dedicated his 1973 novel &quot;The Honorary Consul&quot; to her, &quot;with love, and in memory of the many happy weeks I have passed at San Isidro and Mar del Plata.&quot;

Victoria Ocampo died in Buenos Aires in 1979, and is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

<doc id="496753" wikidata="Q6708351" url="?curid=496753" title="Lyn McLeod">
<text>Lyn McLeod (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 2003. McLeod was a cabinet minister in the Liberal government of David Peterson from 1987 to 1990, and served as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party from 1992 to 1996.

==Background==
McLeod graduated from the University of Manitoba and received a Master of Arts degree in Psychology from Lakehead University, in the Northern Ontario city of Thunder Bay. She was trustee on the Lakehead Board of Education for seventeen years and its chair for seven. McLeod was also appointed to the Board of Governors of Lakehead University in 1986.

She was married to the late Neil McLeod, a prominent Thunder Bay family physician.

==Political career==

===First term (1987–1990)===
She was elected for the riding of Fort William in the provincial election of 1987, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Michael Hennessy by 1,463 votes. The Liberals won a landslide majority in this election and made several historical breakthroughs in Northern Ontario. McLeod was appointed Minister of Colleges and Universities on September 29, 1987. Following a cabinet shuffle on August 2, 1989, she was named Minister of Energy and Minister of Natural Resources.

The Liberals were upset by the New Democratic Party in the provincial election of 1990, although McLeod was able to retain her riding against a strong challenge from NDP candidate Dan Hutsul, winning by 1,345 votes. Unlike most other Liberal candidates in this election, McLeod was supported by prominent members from the Ontario Secondary School Teachers&#x27; Federation in her region.

====Cabinet positions====

=== Second term and Ontario Liberal Party Leadership (1990–1995)===
Peterson personally lost his seat in the 1990 campaign, and the Liberal party went through a series of interim leaders before holding a leadership convention in early 1992. McLeod was one of six candidates for the position, and was widely regarded as the main challenger to frontrunner Murray Elston. She finished a strong second on the first ballot, and overtook Elston on the third with support from Steve Mahoney&#x27;s delegates. McLeod&#x27;s people had made a deal with second-tier leadership contender Charles Beer. The Elston camp had an unexpectedly large lead on the first ballot, as McLeod lent Beer some of her delegates to give him a respectable showing, and Elston&#x27;s margin dropped significantly when the eliminated Beer threw his full support behind McLeod. McLeod finally defeated Elston by nine votes on the fifth ballot, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in Ontario.

===1995 provincial election campaign===
With Bob Rae&#x27;s NDP government being widely blamed for mishandling the major recession, McLeod&#x27;s Liberals held a steady lead in the polls for most of the period from 1992 to 1995, and were generally expected to win the 1995 campaign. The party, however, damaged its credibility through a series of high-profile policy reversals in the period leading up to the election.

The most notable of these occurred when McLeod withdrew Liberal support for the proposed Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act (Bill 167), which would have granted same-sex couples most of the same rights as opposite-sex common law couples, introduced by the NDP government of Bob Rae in 1994. The legislation was defeated after the majority of Liberal MPPs and twelve NDP MPPs joined with the entire Progressive Conservative caucus in voting against it. Many regarded McLeod&#x27;s decision as cynical and opportunistic, and some believe that it was intended to boost Liberal fortunes in rural areas following a by-election loss in the rural, socially conservative riding of Victoria—Haliburton. The result, however, was that the party earned a reputation for &quot;flip-flopping&quot; and inconsistency, while offending its socially progressive supporters.

McLeod also offended some immigrant voters, an electorally important group for Liberals, by criticizing the Rae government&#x27;s handling of Somali refugee claims. Her intent was to draw attention to criminal gangs that were forcing Somalis to move to Ontario and defraud the provincial welfare system. Several, however, interpreted her criticisms as being directed toward the entire community.

During the campaign itself, McLeod further alienated many voters with an overly aggressive performance in the party leaders&#x27; debate, clashing with Premier Bob Rae and waving her party&#x27;s platform before the cameras on several occasions. Prior to this performance, provincial Liberal support was regarded by many political insiders as soft and unsteady. After the debate, many voters who were previously leaning to the Liberals shifted to Mike Harris&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives, who were in third place in the legislature. The Tories surpassed the Liberals to grab the swing in support away from the NDP and finished with a majority, while the Liberals finished with less support than the previous campaign and managed only 30 out of 130 seats.

McLeod herself was easily re-elected in Fort William, defeating Thunder Bay municipal councillor and Tory candidate Evelyn Dodds by over 8,000 votes. Some Liberals called on McLeod to step down after the election, and she announced her resignation as party leader two months later.

===Third term (1995–1999)===

McLeod remained a prominent Liberal MPP under new leader Dalton McGuinty, serving as education critic from 1996 to 1999. She was generally regarded as successful in this role, and proved an able opponent of Education Minister John Snobelen&#x27;s restructuring policies.

===Fourth term (1999–2003)===
McLeod was re-elected by a landslide in the provincial election of 1999, in the redistributed riding of Thunder Bay—Atikokan. The Tories won the election with a reduced majority, and McLeod swapped shadow cabinet portfolios with Gerard Kennedy to serve as her party&#x27;s health critic in the legislature that followed. She did not seek re-election in 2003.

==Later life==
Following her retirement, McLeod was appointed to the newly founded Health Council of Canada. She also was named as the first chancellor of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology in June 2004, and is a vice-chair of the board of governors at Confederation College in Thunder Bay. In 2014, she was made a Member of the Order of Ontario in recognition for having &quot;devoted her career to public service and continuing to be actively involved in community work around the issues of education and health care.&quot;

<text>Prince Frederick Henry Ludwig of Prussia (; 18 January 1726 – 3 August 1802) was a Prussian general, statesman, and diplomat. He was a son of King Frederick William I of Prussia and Princess Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, and the younger brother of Frederick the Great. Prince Henry led Prussian armies in the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years&#x27; War, having never lost a battle in the latter. In 1786, he was suggested as a candidate to be a monarch in the United States.

== Biography ==
Born in Berlin, Henry was the 13th child of King Frederick William I of Prussia and Princess Sophia Dorothea of Hanover.

When he was only 14, Henry was appointed as Colonel of the 35th by Frederick after he became king in 1740, leading Henry to participate in the first two Silesian Wars. Henry&#x27;s conflicts with his older brother, King Frederick II of Prussia, are almost legendary. Especially when he was young, the king bullied his little brother much like his father had bullied him. Although remarkably similar in appearance and tastes (both were fond of the arts and French literature, and both were exceptional military commanders) Henry resented being in Frederick&#x27;s shadow while the latter excluded his brothers from all decisions about state affairs. Nonetheless, he loyally served as one of his brother&#x27;s top generals throughout Frederick&#x27;s reign. His military achievements eventually earned him the respect of his brother. Henry tended to be less aggressive than the King in battle; although he never won a victory of the scale of Rossbach or Leuthen (two of Frederick&#x27;s greatest victories), his caution served him well as he was never defeated on the battlefield like his brother at Kolín or Kunersdorf. Henry lived in the shadow of his older brother and sometimes criticized the king&#x27;s military strategies and foreign policies, although in later years the brothers became closer. In 1753 he published his memoirs under the pseudonym &quot;Maréchal Gessler&quot;.

On 25 June 1752, Henry married Princess Wilhelmina of Hesse-Kassel in Charlottenburg Palace, but they had no children. Henry lived in Rheinsberg Palace after receiving it as a gift from his brother in 1744 who also had a grand palace built for him in Berlin between 1748 and 1753 (today the main building of the Humboldt University of Berlin). He also had an apartment in the City Palace, Potsdam, since he was regularly present at his brother&#x27;s court there and in nearby Sanssouci. 

Despite the marriage, he scarcely concealed his passion for other men and developed intimate friendships with the actor Pierre-Jean Fromentin de Blainville and the French emigre Count La Roche-Aymon. From 1758, his adjutant and main favorite was Friedrich Adolf, Count von Kalckreuth, the later field marshal, but in 1766 they fell out over the prince&#x27;s wife. His longtime favourite, Major von Kaphengst, exploited the prince&#x27;s interest in him to lead a dissipated, wasteful life at Schloss Meseberg, an estate not far from Rheinsberg which Henry had bought for him in 1774 for which he had sold 29 paintings from his collection to Catherine the Great. In 1784, Henry had to take out a loan of 130,000 thalers in France to pay off Kaphengst&#x27;s debt; King Louis XVI of France personally vouched for it. But then he separated from his lover. The king, himself presumed to have been homosexual, tolerated his brother&#x27;s love affairs, sometimes even pursuing them with jealousy, but despised Kaphengst and refused his promotion to colonel whereupon the latter took his leave.Henry successfully led Prussian armies as a general during the Third Silesian War (1756–1763, part of the Seven Years&#x27; War). He greatly distinguished himself during his brother&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Prague and fought during the Prussians&#x27; subsequent defeat at Kolin. After the Prussian Army&#x27;s initial success against one wing of the joint Russian and Austrian Armies in the Battle of Kunersdorf, Henry urged his brother Frederick to stop attacking. The king, who had already sent a message of victory to Berlin, pressed the attack. The day ended with a virtually destroyed Prussian army, a virtually defenseless Kingdom of Prussia, and a complete victory by the Russo-Austrian force. Afterwards, Henry reorganized the routed Prussian forces. Frederick came to rely on his brother as commander of the Prussian forces in the east, Frederick&#x27;s strategic flank. Henry later won his most famous victory at Freiberg in 1762, the final battle of the war between Austria and Prussia; during subsequent peace negotiations, Frederick wrote to him, &quot;You alone have the honor of breaking down Austrian obstinacy.&quot; The statements of the contemporaries culminate in the legendary praise of the king, often quoted by biographers, that his brother was the only general who did not make any mistakes in the Seven Years&#x27; War.
After the Seven Years&#x27; War, Henry worked as a shrewd diplomat who helped plan the First Partition of Poland through trips to Stockholm and Saint Petersburg. During the War of the Bavarian Succession he commanded one of the two Prussian main armies, but saw little action. In the 1780s he made two diplomatic trips to France. He was a friend of Jean-Louis Favier.

Although the king treated him generously, which of course did not prevent Henry from often being short of money, Henry attempted to secure a principality for himself and twice tried to become King of Poland, but was opposed by a displeased Frederick. The king frustrated Henry&#x27;s attempt to become ruler of a kingdom Catherine II of Russia planned to create in Wallachia.

== Proposal for King of the United States ==
In 1786, either Nathaniel Gorham, then-President of the Continental Congress, or Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, the Prussian general who served in the Continental Army, suggested to Alexander Hamilton that Henry should become monarch of the United States, but the prince declined and the new nation had no support for monarchy.

== Last years ==

After the death of Frederick in 1786, Henry hoped to become more influential in the Prussian government as the advisor of his nephew, the new King Frederick William II of Prussia. Although he was less influential than he hoped, Henry was more important during the last years of his life in advising King Frederick William III, who began his reign in 1797.

In 1784, Henry had made a journey of several months to Paris; in October 1788 he went there for the second time, frequented the court of Versailles and met the politically influential circles of the capital, and also visited the Duke of Orléans (soon to become &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;) in the Château du Raincy. He returned to Rheinsberg in good time in March 1789, before the Storming of the Bastille began in July.

From 1798 to 1801 Henry spent a few weeks in August at Königs Wusterhausen Castle, his father&#x27;s hunting lodge and favorite place to stay, out of sentimental memories to where he had spent his childhood vacations. His youngest brother Ferdinand accompanied him there several times.

Voltaire had seen in Frederick the embodiment of his &quot;Philosopher King&quot;. Arguably, Henry was by deed the man Voltaire had hoped the &quot;Age of Reason&quot; would produce. The Swedish ambassador, count Carl Gustaf Tessin, a fierce opponent of the king, had written as early as 1760: &quot;Prince Henry is equal to his royal brother in the art of war, superior in virtue. Many Henrys would make the world happy, just as two Fredericks would destroy it.&quot;

Henry died at Rheinsberg Palace on 3 August 1802, at the age of 76.

<doc id="496761" wikidata="Q2503441" url="?curid=496761" title="University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh">
<text>The University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh (UW Oshkosh or UWO) is a public university in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the University of Wisconsin System and offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degree programs to around 13,000 students each year.

==History==
In 1871, Oshkosh State Normal School, a teacher-training school was established. It became the first school of this type in the nation to have a kindergarten; Professor Rose C. Swart introduced practice teaching in 1872. Tuition was originally free to all who declared their intention to teach in Wisconsin public schools.

Fire destroyed the main campus building in 1916; Dempsey Hall replaced it in 1918. The institution changed its name to Oshkosh State Teachers College in 1927 and Wisconsin State College-Oshkosh in 1951. Graduate school was added in 1963. In 1971, the institution merged into the University of Wisconsin System, becoming the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh. Led by Chancellor Andrew J. Leavitt, UW Oshkosh serves the region as the third largest university in Wisconsin with an annual on- and off-campus enrollment of nearly 13,000. The university has pledged a campus goal of being carbon-neutral by 2030.

The University of Wisconsin System dissolved the University of Wisconsin Colleges In 2018 and their campuses became affiliated with area universities in the system. University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh now operates satellite campuses in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin as University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, Fond du Lac Campus (formerly UW-Fond du Lac) and Menasha, Wisconsin as University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, Fox Cities Campus (formerly UW-Fox Valley).

In 2023, the university faced significant financial challenges. State legislators had imposed a tuition freeze through 2021, enrollment had declined, and state legislature cut the university system&#x27;s budget by $32 million (the amount equal to what they believed was previously spent on diversity and equity programs and services throughout the system). In response, the university has an $18 million deficit that it plans to address by eliminating 200 non-faculty jobs and requiring all remaining employees to take furlough days. In April 2024, faculty and staff responded with a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Leavitt&#x27;s leadership.

==Campus==
Four locations on the campus have been listed on Registered Historic Places.

===Oshkosh State Normal School Historic District===
Three buildings on the original campus comprise this historic district. Dempsey Hall serves as the administration center of the campus. Harrington Hall hosts geology classes. Swart Hall, completed in 1928, is used by the mathematics, social work, and sociology departments and houses the Center for Economic Education. It was originally used as a lab school where student teachers taught kindergarten through ninth grade students.

===Oviatt House===
Moses Hooper moved to Oshkosh in 1863 and started construction of the house in 1882. It was located at the north edge of the Wisconsin State Normal School at Oshkosh. It cost approximately $20,000 to build. Hooper moved into his new residence on October 31, 1883. The structure had modern amenities including hot water, heat, and running water. The interior was painted by local painters Frank Waldo and Gustav Behncke. The house was sold on September 20, 1900, to Dr. Charles W. Oviatt, a surgeon who paid $18,000 for the property. After Oviatt&#x27;s death in 1912, his heirs sold the house and grounds to the State Normal School Regents in 1913 with the agreement that the heirs could live in the house until June 1914.

The house was first used by the school as a women&#x27;s dormitory, the first on campus. Because the dormitory operated at a loss, school president Polk discontinued the venture in 1932. After considering dismantling the building, Polk started renting the house from the school in 1934. The following three presidents of the school also resided in the house, ending with President Penson in 1989. The University of Wisconsin Oshkosh Foundation moved its office in the house the following year.

The Oviatt House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

Currently the Oviatt House is head for the Honors College.

===Thomas R. Wall Residence===
The Thomas R. Wall Residence is a Colonial Revival-style house located on campus. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1984. The Thomas R. Wall Residence was built between 1898 and 1900 by the prominent local architect William Waters. In 1947, the residence was purchased by the university and has been used in various functions. It is currently used as the Multi-Cultural Education Center, which it has done so since 1972.

===William E. Pollock Residence===
William E. Pollock managed OshKosh B&#x27;Gosh. He had Fluor Brothers construction company build the house in 1920 for $19,000. The yard included a three-car garage, garden, and fishing pond. Pollock lived in the house from 1920 until 1937. He sold the house on a land contract, but the house was returned to him after the contract was unfulfilled. Pollock then donated the house to the Oshkosh State Teachers College in 1943.

The college turned the residence into a women&#x27;s dormitory which could house up to 32 students. In the 1960s it was used as an honors dormitory until closing in 1967. From 1967 until 1970 it housed the College of Nursing offices. When the College of Nursing was relocated to a new building, the structure was taken over by the Alumni Association, who have occupied it since 1970. It is occasionally used for special functions. Notable visitors have included President Jimmy Carter, United Nations ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Edward Albee.

The house is designed as a Mediterranean Revival style house with Italian and Spanish motif. The entrance has an ornate semi-circular wrought iron door leading into a large foyer. The front entry hall opens into a large living room and a smaller parlor. A formal staircase rises to an open landing and to a study. The second story bedrooms are used as offices for Alumni and Foundation staff. The rear consists of a formal dining room, kitchen, and pantry. The building has three chimneys capped with campaniles that resemble Italian bell towers. The residence&#x27;s exterior is framed by concrete planters and topped by a wrought iron balcony outside of the second-story French windows. The roof is low-pitched red-barrel tile.

Among campus dormant chapters, Phi Sigma Kappa was present since 1925, first as the &quot;Periclean Club,&quot; which in 1965 renamed itself as a chapter of Phi Sigma Epsilon, closing with most other groups in the late 1970s. Its national merged with the larger and older Phi Sigma Kappa in 1985, and its alumni remain active today. Phi Beta Sigma was founded in 1984 but is currently inactive. Delta Chi became dormant in December 2022.

From this downturn, fraternities and sororities began to re-emerge in the mid-1980s, according to the Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life office.

===Media===

The school&#x27;s newspaper is the award-winning &quot;Advance-Titan&quot;, a weekly publication produced by students. It was founded in 1894 by students and faculty.

The school&#x27;s radio station, WRST-FM 90.3, is located in the Arts &amp; Communications building. The call letters stand for &quot;Radio Station of the Titans.&quot; The station carries Wisconsin Public Radio and student programming.

Dr. Robert &quot;Doc&quot; Snyder founded the Radio-TV-Film program in 1964, with the aim of motivating students by fostering considerate and responsible communication. The department offers a comprehensive media curriculum that includes critical media analysis and extensive practical experience. Additionally, the program provides various extracurricular organizations such as Film Society and the International Film Series.

The Radio-TV-Film program broadened its reach across the nation by introducing Titan TV in 1984, a national satellite station that featured a complete lineup of student-produced programming.

<doc id="496766" wikidata="Q652858" url="?curid=496766" title="List of kings of Lydia">
<text>This article lists the known kings of [[Lydia]], both legendary and historical. Lydia was an ancient kingdom in western Anatolia during the first millennium BC. It may have originated as a country in the second millennium BC and was possibly called Maeonia at one time, given that Herodotus says the people were called Maeonians before they became known as Lydians. Herodotus and other sources refer to three dynasties: the Maeoniae, Heracleidae (Heraclids) and Mermnadae. The first two are legendary, though later members of the Heraclid dynasty are at least semi-legendary. The Mermnadae are historical.

==Maeoniae==
The earliest Maeonian or Lydian king mentioned by Herodotus is Manes who was the father of Atys. There was a severe famine during the reign of Atys and half of the citizens, led by Atys&#x27; son Tyrrhenus, emigrated to Italy as the Tyrrhenians. Other sources, such as Strabo, name Tmolus and his son Tantalus as kings of the region about the same time, supposedly ruling from the land about Mount Sipylus, but it is asserted that these two were the same people as Manes and Atys, especially as Omphale is a member of both families. Dionysius of Halicarnassus instead puts Cotys as the son of Manes, and as the father of Atys.

The known legendary kings are:

* Manes
* Atys, son of Manes
* Lydus, son of Atys

Herodotus says that Lydus gave his name to the country and its people. The line of Lydus continued through an unstated number of generations until they, as Herodotus says, &quot;turned over the management of affairs to the Heraclids&quot;. He adds that the Heraclids in Lydia were the descendants of Heracles and a slave-girl belonging to Iardanus; the line was from Heracles through Alcaeus, Belus and Ninus to Agron who was the first Heraclid king of Lydia.

==Heraclidae==
Herodotus says the Heraclids ruled Lydia for 505 years through 22 generations with son succeeding father all down the line from Agron to Candaules. While Candaules was the last of the Heraclids to reign at Sardis, Herodotus says Agron was the first and thereby implies that Sardis was already the capital of Lydia in Maeonian times. Candaules died c. 687 BC and so the 505-year span stated by Herodotus suggests c.1192 BC for Agron&#x27;s accession.

The known Heraclid kings are:

* Agron (fl. c.1192 BC; legendary great-great-grandson of Heracles and a Lydian slave-girl via Alcaeus, Belus and Ninus)
* 19 legendary kings, names unknown, all succeeding father to son
* Meles, &quot;aka&quot; Myrsus (8th century BC; semi-legendary father of Candaules)
* Candaules, &quot;aka&quot; Myrsilus (died c.687 BC; probably historical; son of Meles; murdered by Gyges)

==Mermnadae==
Although this dynasty is historical, the dates for it have never been determined with certainty. The traditional dates are derived from Herodotus, who gives some reign-lengths, but these have been questioned by modern scholars on the basis of synchronisms with Assyrian history. The name of the dynasty () may be attested in Lydian transmission as -𐤪𐤷𐤦𐤪𐤫𐤠 &quot;mλimna-&quot;. Etymologically, it possibly contains the Carian word &quot;mno-&quot; &#x27;son&#x27; or &#x27;descendant&#x27;, which would then represent an argument for the Carian origin of the Mermnad clan.

There were five kings, all historical figures, in the Mermnad line: 
* Gyges, &quot;aka&quot; Guges (c.680–c.644 BCE; husband of Candaules&#x27; widow)
* Ardys, &quot;aka&quot; Ardysus (c.644–c.637 BC; son of Gyges)
* Sadyattes (c.637–c.635 BCE; son of Ardys)
* Alyattes (c.635–585 BCE; son of Sadyattes)
* Croesus, &quot;aka&quot; Kroisos (c.585–546 BC; son of Alyattes)

Gyges died in battle c.644 BCE, fighting against the Cimmerians, and was succeeded by Ardys. The most successful king was Alyattes, under whom Lydia reached its peak of power and prosperity. Croesus was defeated by Cyrus the Great at the battles of Pteria and Thymbra. Cyrus annexed Lydia after the Siege of Sardis which ended in early 546 BC, but the fate of Croesus himself is uncertain.

<doc id="496767" wikidata="Q1350588" url="?curid=496767" title="Gil Gerard">
<text>Gil Gerard (born January 23, 1943) is an American actor, whose roles include Captain William &quot;Buck&quot; Rogers in the 1979–81 television series &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;.

==Early life==
Gerard was born January 23, 1943, in Little Rock, Arkansas, to a college instructor mother and a salesman father. In 1960, he attended Maryknoll Seminary in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, and played the title role in an all-male production of &quot;The Music Man&quot;. He graduated from Little Rock Catholic High School for Boys, and later attended the University of Central Arkansas but dropped out before graduation.

==Career==
Gerard traveled to New York City, where he studied drama by day and drove a taxicab at night. Gerard picked up a fare who showed a lively interest in the problems of unknown, unemployed actors. Before he left the cab, he told Gerard to report in a few days to the set of &quot;Love Story&quot;, which was being filmed on location in New York. When Gerard arrived on the &quot;Love Story&quot; set, he was hired as an extra. Later that day, he was singled out for a &quot;bit&quot; part, but he was not included in the finished film.

During the next few years, he did most of his acting in television commercials, almost 400, including a stint as spokesman for the Ford Motor Company. After small roles in the gay-themed film &quot;Some of My Best Friends Are...&quot; (1971), and the thriller &quot;Man on a Swing&quot; (1974), Gerard gained a prominent role in the daytime soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot; for two years. Gerard formed his own production company in partnership with a writer-producer, co-authored a screenplay called &quot;Hooch&quot; (1977) and filmed it as a starring vehicle for himself. With &quot;Hooch&quot; completed, he traveled to California to co-star with Yvette Mimieux in &quot;Ransom for Alice!&quot; (1977) and to play Lee Grant&#x27;s youthful lover in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; (1977). He appeared in a 1977 episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (&quot;The Ninth Step&quot;) as Marty Cobb, a former cop and recovering alcoholic. A guest appearance in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; impressed producer-star Michael Landon, who cast him in the leading role in the 1978 TV movie &quot;Killing Stone&quot;. 

Gerard then landed his best-known role, as Captain William &quot;Buck&quot; Rogers in the TV series &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; which ran from 1979-81, with the feature-length pilot episode being released theatrically some months prior to the first broadcast of the series. After this, he was featured in a number of other TV shows and movies, including starring roles in the 1982 TV movie &quot;Hear No Evil&quot; as Dragon, the short-lived series &quot;Sidekicks&quot; (1986) and &quot;E.A.R.T.H. Force&quot; (1990).

In 1992, Gerard hosted the reality TV series &quot;Code 3&quot;, which followed firefighters from different areas of the US as they responded to emergency calls. The show ran on the Fox TV Network until the following year. For the remainder of the 1990s, Gerard made guest appearances on various TV shows, including &quot;Fish Police&quot;, &quot;Brotherly Love&quot;, &quot;The Big Easy&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;.

In January 2007, Gerard was the subject of the one-hour documentary &quot;Action Hero Makeover&quot;, which was written, produced and directed by his then-longtime companion, Adrienne Crow for the Discovery Health Channel. The film documented his year-long progress after undergoing life-saving mini-gastric bypass surgery in October 2005. According to the program, he had been struggling with his weight for 40 years, losing weight only to gain it back. By the time of the program&#x27;s production, his weight had risen to over , and he had many life-threatening health issues including a severe problem with type 2 diabetes. Within five days of the surgery he had lost , within three months he had lost , and within ten months he lost a total of .

Gerard and his &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; co-star Erin Gray reunited in 2007 for the TV film &quot;Nuclear Hurricane&quot;, and also returned to the &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; universe by playing the characters&#x27; parents in the pilot episode of James Cawley&#x27;s &quot;Buck Rogers Begins&quot; Internet video series in 2009.

Gerard guest-starred as Admiral Jack Sheehan in &quot;Kitumba&quot;, the January 1, 2014, episode of the fan web series &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;.

In 2015, Gerard voiced Megatronus in &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==

By the end of the 1980s, Gerard had been married and divorced four times. His first marriage, in the 1960s to a secretary in his home state of Arkansas, lasted just eight months. After moving to New York to pursue his acting ambitions, his second marriage to a bank executive was equally troubled though lasted (on and off) for seven years. Following his move to Los Angeles in the late 1970s, he married model/actress Connie Sellecca in 1979. Their son, Gilbert Vincent Gerard, or &quot;Gib&quot;, was born in 1981. Their seven-year marriage began to disintegrate following the cancellation of Gerard&#x27;s show &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; and his increasing addictions to drugs, alcohol, and overeating. The marriage was formally dissolved in 1987, following a bitter custody battle which gave Sellecca main custody of their son. Gerard married again the same year, to interior designer Bobi Leonard, though the marriage lasted only a year and was then formally dissolved in 1989.

Gerard has been frank about his battle with addictions. Although he went through recovery for his addiction to cocaine and alcohol, following his divorce from Sellecca in the mid 1980s, his compulsive eating habits increased and he would find himself devouring unhealthy portions of junk food. By 1988, he weighed and used a self-help treatment for his addiction, though he estimated that his weight problem had cost him work opportunities in the region of a million dollars. By 1990, he weighed .

<doc id="496769" wikidata="Q8055632" url="?curid=496769" title="Yorker">
<text>In cricket, a yorker is a ball bowled (a delivery) which bounces by the batsman&#x27;s feet. This makes it very challenging for a batter to play.

When a batsman assumes a normal stance, a yorker generally bounces on the cricket pitch on or near the batsman&#x27;s popping crease. A batsman who advances down the pitch to strike the ball (typically to spin bowlers) may by so advancing cause the ball to pitch (or land) at or around their feet and may thus cause themself to be &quot;yorked&quot;. Yorkers are considered to be one of the most difficult deliveries to bowl.

==Etymology==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives the derivation of the term as originating in Yorkshire, a notable English cricketing county. 

According to Oxford dictionaries, the term was coined because players from York bowled these deliveries. Another theory attributes the name to the other meaning of yorker which is a cheater. However, other derivations have been suggested. The term may derive from the 18th and 19th century slang term &quot;to pull Yorkshire&quot; on a person meaning to trick or deceive them, although there is evidence to suggest that the Middle English word &quot;yuerke&quot; (meaning to trick or deceive) may have been the source.

==Play==

A batsman who has been beaten by a yorker is said to have been yorked. &quot;Beaten&quot; in this context does not mean that the batsman is bowled or given out lbw but can include the batsman missing the ball with the bat. A delivery which is intended to be a yorker but which does not york the batsman is known as an attempted yorker.

A batsman in their normal stance will raise his bat (backlift) as the bowler bowls which can make the yorker difficult to play when it arrives at the batsman&#x27;s feet. A batsman may only realise very late that the delivery is of yorker length and will jam their bat down to &quot;dig out&quot; the yorker.

==Use==

A yorker is a difficult delivery to bowl as a mistimed delivery can either result in a full toss or half-volley which can easily be played by the batsman. Bowling yorkers is a tactic used most often by fast bowlers. A fast yorker is one of the most difficult types of delivery in cricket to play successfully, as the bat must be swung down right to the pitch to intercept the ball—if any gap remains between the bat and the pitch, the ball can squeeze through and potentially go on to hit the wicket. The yorker might miss the bat but hit the pads in front of the wicket, resulting in the batsman getting out lbw. When the batsman blocks such a ball, it is referred to as &quot;dug out&quot;. A bowler who achieves swing when bowling yorkers can be even more dangerous, as the ball will deviate sideways as it travels towards the batsman, making it even harder to hit.

Yorkers can also be aimed directly at the batsman&#x27;s feet, forcing the batsman to shift his feet while attempting to play the ball, or risk being hit. Inswinging yorkers have a reputation for being particularly hard to defend and difficult to score runs off. Such a delivery is colloquially known as a sandshoe crusher, toe crusher, cobbler&#x27;s delight or nail breaker. A recent variation is the wide yorker, which is delivered wide of the batsman on the off side. This is particularly useful in Twenty20 cricket as a ploy to restrict runs rather than to get the batsman out.

Despite the effectiveness of yorkers, they are notoriously difficult to bowl correctly and usually will be attempted only a handful of times during a sequence of several overs. Yorkers are best used to surprise a batsman who has become accustomed to hitting shorter-pitched balls and not with the bat speed necessary to defend against a yorker. As such, a yorker is frequently bowled quickly to give the batsman less time to react and position his bat.

The yorker is regarded as particularly effective against weak tail-end batsmen, who often lack the skill to defend even a non-swinging yorker and who are sometimes less susceptible to other bowling tactics. It is also particularly effective in the later stages of an innings in one-day cricket, because it is the most difficult of all deliveries to score off even if defended successfully. Runs will often only be scored off edges or straight down the ground.

The most notable bowlers in delivering yorkers are Pakistanis Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram, and Shoaib Akhtar, Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga, Australians Brett Lee, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Johnson, New Zealanders Trent Boult, Shane Bond and Tim Southee, South Africans Dale Steyn and Allan Donald, West Indians Patrick Patterson, Malcolm Marshall, Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose and Jerome Taylor, Indians Zaheer Khan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, T. Natarajan and Englishmen Andrew Flintoff, Chris Jordan and Mark Wood.

==Bowling a yorker==

A yorker is usually delivered very late in the bowling action with the hand pointing almost vertically. The aim is both to get more pace and to deliver it later so as to deceive the batsman in flight. It is usually recommended to deliver the ball with some inswing but an away-swinging yorker aimed at the pads can be just as effective. Because yorkers are quite difficult to bowl they require substantial practice in order to achieve consistent success.
