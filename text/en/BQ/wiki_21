<text>Giovanni Villani (; 1276 or 1280 – 1348) was an Italian banker, official, diplomat and chronicler from Florence who wrote the &quot;Nuova Cronica&quot; (&quot;New Chronicles&quot;) on the history of Florence. He was a leading statesman of Florence but later gained an unsavoury reputation and served time in prison as a result of the bankruptcy of a trading and banking company he worked for. His interest in and elaboration of economic details, statistical information, and political and psychological insight mark him as a more modern chronicler of late medieval Europe. His &quot;Cronica&quot; is viewed as the first introduction of statistics as a positive element in history.
However, historian Kenneth R. Bartlett notes that, in contrast to his Renaissance-era successors, &quot;his reliance on such elements as divine providence links Villani closely with the medieval vernacular chronicle tradition.&quot; In recurring themes made implicit through significant events described in his &quot;Cronica&quot;, Villani also emphasized three assumptions about the relationship of sin and morality to historical events, these being that excess brings disaster, that forces of right and wrong are in constant struggle, and that events are directly influenced by the will of God.

Villani was inspired to write his &quot;Cronica&quot; after attending the jubilee celebration in Rome in 1300 and noting the venerable history of that city. He outlined the events in his &quot;Cronica&quot; year for year, following a strictly linear narrative format. He provided intricate details on many important historical events of the city of Florence and the wider region of Tuscany, such as construction projects, floods, fires, famines, and plagues.

While continuing work on the &quot;Cronica&quot; and detailing the enormous loss of life during the Black Death in 1348, Villani died of the same illness. His work on the &quot;Cronica&quot; was continued by his brother and nephew. Villani&#x27;s work has received both praise and criticism from modern historians. The criticism is mostly aimed at his emphasis on supernatural guidance of events, his organizational style, and his glorification of the papacy and Florence.

==Life and career==

Giovanni Villani was born into the Florentine merchant middle class. He was the son of Villano di Stoldi di Bellincione, who came from an old and well-respected &quot;arti maggiori&quot; family of merchants. Villani was a member of the &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; (wool finishers) guild in Florence since 1300, serving on the &quot;mercanzia&quot; council of eight. During that year he visited Rome during the jubilee celebration. After observing the well-known ancient monuments of Rome and acknowledging its renowned historical personages, he was inspired to write the &quot;Cronica&quot;, a universal history of Florence in a strictly linear, year-by-year format. During the early years of the 14th century, he gained political perspective by travelling throughout Italy, Switzerland, France and Flanders for the Peruzzi bank, of which he was a shareholder from 1300 to 1308. Traveling abroad as a factor for the company, Villani was paid a regular salary in addition to his shareholding profits. On May 15, 1306, one of the first exchange contracts (&quot;cambium&quot;) to mention the city of Bruges involved two parties: Giovanni Villani, representing the Peruzzi Company, granting a loan to Tommaso Fini, representing the Gallerani Company of Siena. Villani and his brother Matteo transferred most of their economic activities to the Buonaccorsi firm by 1322. Giovanni Villani was a co-director of Buonaccorsi in 1324. The Buonaccorsi handled banking and commodity trade activities, spreading their influence throughout Italy, France, Flanders, England and several places in the Mediterranean.

Villani returned to Florence in 1307 where he married and settled down for a life of city politics. He became one of the priors of Florence in 1316 and 1317. At the same time, he participated in the crafty diplomatic tactics that resulted in peace with Pisa and Lucca. As head of the mint beginning in 1316, he collected its earlier records and created a register of all the coins struck in Florence. In 1321, he was again chosen prior, and in 1324 was deputed to inspect the rebuilding of the city walls. He went with the Florentine army to fight against Castruccio Castracani, lord of Lucca, and was present at Altopascio during Florence&#x27;s defeat. In his &quot;Cronica&quot;, he gave a detailed account of why Florence was unable to acquire Lucca after the death of Castruccio Castracani.

A famine spread across Tuscany in 1328. From 1329 to 1330 Villani was a commune-appointed magistrate of provisioning protecting Florence from the famine&#x27;s worst effects. In order to mitigate rising levels of starvation and assuage peasant discontent, grain was speedily imported from Sicily through Talamone, were taken from the city purse by the Florentine commune to aid the relief effort, and all the city&#x27;s bakers had their ovens requisitioned by the government so that loaves of bread could be sold at affordable prices to the riotous and starving poor.
Villani was sent on another diplomatic mission in 1329, this time to Bologna to meet Cardinal Bertrand de Pouget. From 1330 to 1331 he superintended the making of Andrea Pisano&#x27;s bronze doors for the Baptistry. At the same time, he served as the consul for his guild of the &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; and watched over the raising of the &quot;campanile&quot; of the Badìa. He was also sent with others as a hostage to Ferrara, to ensure that Florence made good on a debt; he resided there for some months in 1341.

Villani often expressed an optimistic viewpoint in his writing; this changed with the short-lived regime of Walter VI of Brienne, a despot invited to Florence and granted &quot;signoria&quot;. In fact, after experiencing his own financial troubles, a terminated career, and the failure of Florence in international affairs, and witnessing a host of different natural calamities and the onset of the Black Death in Europe, he became convinced that the apocalypse and final judgement was near. The bankruptcy of the Buonaccorsi Company led to Villani&#x27;s conviction and imprisonment in 1346, as he was a main partner. Other banking companies also went bankrupt, such as the Peruzzi in 1343 and the Compagnia dei Bardi in 1346 (they were allied in a joint venture by 1336); Villani calculated that before their bankruptcy the Peruzzi had lost some 600,000 florins and the Bardi had lost some 900,000 florins. Although Villani attributed the losses to the companies&#x27; massive monetary loans to Edward III of England which were never repaid, historian Edwin S. Hunt suggests that the firms simply lacked the resources to have made such loans, which in all probability were much smaller and were not the key reasons for the companies&#x27; failures. The Bardi and Peruzzi were just two of many European banks that Edward III accepted loans from, prominent members of the Bardi and other Florentine families were owed only 63,000 Florins by Edward in 1348, and even a mass of small lenders and investors in Florence could not have made the necessary loan to England. The figure Villani asserted of 400,000 Florins owed to the Peruzzi by Edward alone equalled Villani&#x27;s estimate for the entire payroll of 30,000 workers of the Florentine cloth industry in 1338. Hunt asserts that the failures of the Florentine banks seems closely tied to the expansionist policy of Florence in Tuscany, hoping that newly conquered territory would yield greater security for their trade with northern Europe, but instead resulted in costly campaigns and little profit. In addition to the questionable figures Villani posed for the Peruzzi and Bardi companies, it is also known that several events described in his &quot;Cronica&quot; surrounding the Buonaccorsi&#x27;s bankruptcy were written to deliberately obscure the truth about the company&#x27;s fraudulent behavior; Miller writes that &quot;this is one of the most convincing conclusions&quot; of historian Michele Luzzati&#x27;s &quot;Giovanni Villani e la Compagnia dei Buonaccorsi&quot; (1971).
Villani and the Buonaccorsi had gained an unsavory reputation as early as 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for barratry for his part in building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani&#x27;s reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, Avignon, and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite Walter VI of Brienne to become the next &quot;signor&quot; of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.

However, the legal case against the company was reopened and resumed in October 1343, after the violent overthrow of Walter VI. It is unclear how long Villani served his prison sentence for alleged misconduct during the economic disaster of 1346. It is known that he was imprisoned in the &quot;Carceri delle Stinche&quot;. After the overthrow of the Brienne regime and a subsequent but short-lived aristocratic signoria, the &quot;novi cives&quot; or new families—some even from the lesser guilds—rose up in late September 1343 and established a government that provided them with much greater representation in officialdom. Villani and other chroniclers disdained these rustic non-aristocrats who suddenly rose to power, considering them brazen upstarts incapable of governance. Villani&#x27;s class was at a constitutional disadvantage, as twenty-one guilds representing twenty-one equal voices in government meant that the oligarchy of higher guildsmen was &quot;helplessly outnumbered&quot; as historian John M. Najemy states. Yet by the 1350s the general attitude towards the &quot;novi cives&quot; had changed much, as even Villani&#x27;s brother Matteo depicted them in a heroic light for being united in a coalition with the merchants and artisans to curb oligarchic power. Villani was also a staunch supporter of what he deemed the liberties of the Church, while criticizing the new popular government of the &quot;novi cives&quot; since they protested against the many legal exemptions the Church enjoyed. However, he did find civic pride in that the whole city—including the &quot;novi cives&quot;—had joined together in an uprising against Walter VI, whose sins of imposing tyranny were, to Villani, sufficient justification for the violence needed to overthrow him.

==&quot;Nuova Cronica&quot;==
Villani&#x27;s work is an Italian chronicle written from the perspective of the political class of Florence just as the city rose to a rich and powerful position. Only scanty and partly legendary records had preceded his work, and there is little known of events before the death of Countess Matilda in 1115. The &quot;Chronica de origine civitatis&quot; was composed sometime before 1231, but there is little comparison between this work and Villani&#x27;s; mid-20th-century historian Nicolai Rubinstein states that the legendary accounts in this earlier chronicle were &quot;arbitrarily selected by a compiler whose learning and critical faculties were considerably below the standard of his age.&quot; In contrast, Rubinstein states Villani provided &quot;a mature expression&quot; of Florentine history. Yet Villani still relied upon the &quot;Chronica de origine civitatis&quot; as the prime source for Florence&#x27;s early history in his narrative.

In the 36th chapter of Book 8, Villani states that the idea of writing the &quot;Cronica&quot; was suggested to him during the jubilee of Rome in 1300, under the following circumstances after Pope Boniface VIII made in honor of Christ&#x27;s nativity a great indulgence; Villani writes:
And being on that blessed pilgrimage in the sacred city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as described by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history ... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But in view of the fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city&#x27;s further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.
In his writing, Villani states that he considers Florence to be the &quot;daughter and creation of Rome,&quot; but asserts Rome&#x27;s decline and Florence&#x27;s rise as a great city compelled him to lay out a detailed history of the city. To emphasize the imperial greatness of Florentine history, Villani also asserted that the city was given a second founding when it was rebuilt by Charlemagne (r. 800–814 as Holy Roman Emperor)—which was absent from the &quot;Chronica de origine civitatis&quot;. Historian J. K. Hyde writes that the idea of Florence being the daughter of Rome would have given the Florentines a sense of destiny, while the second founding by Charlemagne provided historical context for alliance with France, which Hyde calls &quot;the touchstone of Guelphism&quot;. Villani&#x27;s reasoning for Rome&#x27;s decline was the schisms of the Church and rebellion against the papal institution, while the ascension of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor (r. 962–973) allowed for the conditions of Florence&#x27;s rise against enemies of papal authority, such as Florentine-conquered Fiesole. Villani was certain that the Republic of Florence had experienced a great setback on its path to glory with the defeat of the Guelphs by the Ghibellines at the Battle of Montaperti in 1260. Despite this, Villani states that the paramount prosperity and tranquility of the city by 1293 was evidenced by the fact that its gates were no longer locked at night and that indirect taxes such as the gate fee (common in times of war) were not levied. Historian Felicity Ratté states that the validity of this comment should be heavily scrutinized considering the Florence statutes of 1290 that designated employment for individuals in charge of locking the city gates. Villani also contradicts himself by writing of a night attack on Florence in 1323 which clearly demonstrates the fact that the gates were locked at night.
In 1300 or shortly after, Villani began working on the &quot;Cronica&quot;, which was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, starting at conventionally biblical times with the story of the Tower of Babel up to the year 1264. The second phase, in six books, covered the history from 1264 until his own time, all the way up to 1346. He outlined the events in his &quot;Cronica&quot; in year-to-year accounts; for this he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. He wrote his &quot;Cronica&quot; in the vernacular language rather than Latin, the language of the educated elite. His chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, sometimes with little interpretation. This often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, especially in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).

Despite numerous mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider&#x27;s knowledge on many subjects, as a result of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.

Villani is perhaps unequalled for the value of the statistical data he has preserved. For example, he recorded that in Florence there were 80 banks, 146 bakeries, 80 members in an association of city judges with 600 notaries, 60 physicians and surgical doctors, 100 shops and dealers of spices, 8,000 to 10,000 children attending primary school each year, 550 to 600 students attending 4 different schools for Scholastic knowledge, 13,200 bushels of grain consumed weekly by the city, and 70,000 to 80,000 pieces of cloth produced in the workshops of the &quot;Arte della Lana&quot; each year, the latter having a total value of .

Villani was a Guelph, but his book is much more taken up with an inquiry into what is useful and true than with factional party considerations. In a departure from Guelph politics, he favored republicanism over monarchy, praising the philosopher Brunetto Latini as &quot;the master and initiator in refining the Florentines, in making them skilled in good speaking and in knowing how to guide and rule our republic according to political science.&quot; However, Villani admitted in his writing that republicanism bred factional strife, that benevolent rulers like Robert of Naples were sometimes needed to keep order, and republicanism could become tyrannical if it came to represent only one class (such as exclusive favoring of aristocrats, merchants, or artisans). When detailing the construction of the Florence Cathedral and the artist Giotto di Bondone as the designer of the new bell tower, Villani called him &quot;the most sovereign master of painting in his time.&quot; Villani&#x27;s &quot;Cronica&quot; also provides the first known biography of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321), author of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, who Villani described as haughty, disdainful, and reserved. In his revised &quot;Cronica&quot; of 1322, Villani shortened Dante&#x27;s biography and the amount of quotations taken from his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Villani&#x27;s actions are explained by Richard H. Lansing and Teodolinda Barolini, who write: &quot;Evidently two decades after the poet&#x27;s death a conservative writer closely identified with the Florentine state still felt obliged to distance himself from the most outspoken critic of the basis of that state&#x27;s prestige.&quot;
Historian Louis Green writes that the &quot;Cronica&quot; was written with three general assumptions about morality which shaped the organization of the work, &quot;[channeling] events into recurring patterns of significance.&quot; These general assumptions were that excess brings disaster, that history is governed by a struggle between right and wrong, and that there is a direct connection between the events of the natural world and the overriding, supernatural and divine will of God who intercedes in these events. For example, Villani described the story of Count Ugolini of Pisa, who at the height of attaining his ill-gotten wealth and power was overthrown and eventually starved to death along with his sons. Green writes that this story in the &quot;Cronica&quot; bears a resemblance to the ancient Greek story of Polycrates and his ring in the work of Herodotus. However, Green notes that Villani&#x27;s &quot;cautionary tales&quot; disembarked from the Classical Greek tradition of the arrogant and haughty rich falling from fortune due to the Greek belief in equalizing forces determining one&#x27;s unavoidable fate, which Green calls &quot;excessive good fortune having to be balanced by an appropriate measure of sorrow.&quot; Villani&#x27;s adherence to Medieval Christianity allowed him to suggest retribution was delivered because of sin and insult to God. He stressed that those who gained prestige would fall prey to pride; confidence in their position would then lead them to sin, and sin would bring on a stage of decline. Villani wrote:
... it seems that it happens in the lordships and states of earthly dignitaries, that as they are at their highest peak, so presently does their decline and ruin follow, and not without the providence of divine justice, in order to punish sins and so that no one should place his trust in fallacious good fortune.

For Villani, this theory of sin and morality being tied directly with fate and fortune fit well with the ultimate fate of the Capetian dynasty of France. The House of Capet was once the champion of the Church and ally of the papacy. However, Villani correlated Philip the Fair&#x27;s defiance of Pope Boniface VIII and seizure of the Templar&#x27;s wealth with later Capetian misfortunes, such as Philip&#x27;s death in a hunting accident, the adultery of the wives of his three sons, the death of his heirs, and even French defeats in the early stages of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Green points out that in Villani&#x27;s writing there are two significant earthly powers that seem to be exempt or immune from this theory of immorality leading to downfall: Florence and the papacy. The interests of these two powers represent, as Green states, &quot;the kingpin of Villani&#x27;s scheme of historical interpretation.&quot;

Besides Divine Providence, Villani acknowledged other events that he believed were explainable via the supernatural. He wrote of many instances where holy men offered prophetic statements that later proved true, such as Pope Clement IV&#x27;s prophecy on the outcome for the Battle of Tagliacozzo. He believed that certain events were really omens of what was to come. For instance, when a lion was sent to Florence as a gift by Boniface VIII, a donkey purportedly killed the lion. He interpreted this as an omen that foretold the Pope&#x27;s beating and untimely death shortly after fighting Philip IV at Anagni; Villani wrote: &quot;when the tamed beast kills the King of Beasts, then the dissolution of the Church will begin.&quot; He also believed in astrology and changes in the heavens as indication of political changes, the deaths of rulers and popes, and natural calamities. However, he noted that the movement of the heavens would not always predetermine the actions of men and did not trump the divine plan of God.

Marilyn Aronberg Lavin states that Villani was most likely serving as a Peruzzi representative in Flanders when he heard the story of the French Jew who in 1290 tried to destroy Host bread (of the Eucharist) but was unsuccessful as the bread allegedly bled profusely as he stabbed it, and turned into flesh as he attempted to boil it in water. In the original account by the Ghent monk Jean de Thilrode in 1294, the Jew was compelled to convert to Christianity, but Villani&#x27;s account followed that of the later &quot;Chronicles of Saint-Denis&quot; (1285–1328) which told that the Jew was burned to death for his crime. Villani&#x27;s &quot;Cronica&quot; marks the first appearance in Italian literature of this legend, while &quot;Villani&#x27;s report includes details which establish an independent Italian branch of the tradition&quot; according to Lavin. St. Antoninus, archbishop of Florence, repeated the story of Villani in his Latin &quot;Chronicles&quot;, while Villani&#x27;s illustrated &quot;Cronica&quot; featured a scene of this French Jew that later appeared in a painting by Paolo Uccello.

==Death and continuation of Villani&#x27;s work==

Villani wrote during the bubonic plague: &quot;The priest who confessed the sick and those who nursed them so generally caught the infection that the victims were abandoned and deprived confession, sacrament, medicine, and nursing ... And many lands and cities were made desolate. And this plague lasted till ________&quot;; Villani left the blank in order to record the time in which the plague was to end. Villani was unable to finish the line as he succumbed to the same plague. He was buried in the Church of Santissima Annunziata, Florence. Villani&#x27;s &quot;Cronica&quot; was considered an important work at the time, valuable enough for his brother and nephew to continue it. Little is known of Villani&#x27;s brother, Matteo, save that he was twice married, that he died of the plague in 1363, and that he continued work on the &quot;Cronica&quot; until his death. Filippo Villani, Matteo&#x27;s son, flourished in the latter half of the 14th century and ended the &quot;Cronica&quot; at 1364; his portion includes details of the lives of many Florentine artists and musicians, including Giotto di Bondone and Francesco Landini. Filippo&#x27;s chronicles were approved by the Chancellor of Florence, Coluccio Salutati, who made corrections to the work and added commentary. The 15th-century Florentine historian Domenico di Leonardo Buoninsegni also featured in the first two chapters of his &quot;Istoria Fiorentina&quot; a summary of Villani&#x27;s &quot;Cronica&quot;.

By the 16th century, more than one edition of the &quot;Cronica&quot; was available in printed form. There was also an abundance of handwritten illuminated manuscripts, including one from Venice by Bartholomeo Zanetti Casterzagense in 1537 and one from Florence by Lorenzo Torrentino in 1554.
==Legacy and criticism==

Historian J.K. Hyde states that the &quot;Nuova Cronica&quot; of Villani is representative of the strong vernacular tradition in Florence, appealing to the people of the time as a narrative that was &quot;easy to read, full of human interest and occasionally spiced with novella-type anecdotes.&quot; Hyde also notes that Villani&#x27;s criticisms of the commune politics in Florence promoted a trend of personal expression amongst later chroniclers that defied official conformity. The &quot;Cronica&quot; is also an incredibly rich historical record; its greatest value to modern historians is its descriptions of the people, data, and events experienced by Villani during his lifetime. Historian Mark Phillips states that all subsequent Florentine accounts of the tyrannical regime of Walter VI of Brienne—including those by Leonardo Bruni and Niccolò Machiavelli—were based upon the primary source of Villani&#x27;s &quot;Cronica&quot;. Villani&#x27;s written work on Dante Alighieri and the age in which he lived has provided insight into Dante&#x27;s work, reasoning, and psyche. The reprinting of new editions of Villani&#x27;s work in the early 20th century provided material for a resurgence in the study of Dante. However, Villani&#x27;s descriptions of events which preceded him by centuries are riddled with inaccurate traditional accounts, popular legend, and hearsay.

In regard to his own time, Villani provides modern historians with valuable details on Florentine social and living habits, such as the growing trend and craze of wealthy Florentines in building large country homes far outside of the city. However, the early 20th-century historian Philip Wicksteed stated of Villani, &quot;When dealing with his own times, and with events immediately connected with Florence, he is a trustworthy witness, but minute accuracy is never his strong point; and in dealing with distant times and places he is hopelessly unreliable.&quot; For example, although Nicolai Rubinstein acknowledged that Villani&#x27;s chronicles were much more matured and developed than earlier ones, Villani still relied on legend and hearsay to account for the origins of cities such as Fiesole. On Villani&#x27;s estimation that a third of Antwerp&#x27;s population died off during the Great Famine of 1315-1317, the early 20th-century historian Henry S. Lucas wrote, &quot;not much faith can be placed in such statistics which are little better than guesses.&quot; Louis Green notes Villani&#x27;s limitation as a chronicler and not a full-fledged historian:
Recording as he did incidents in the order of their occurrence without any of the historian&#x27;s pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit him to see in the altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.
Louis Green asserts that Giovanni&#x27;s &quot;Cronica&quot; expressed the outlook of the merchant community in Florence at the time, but also provided valuable indications of &quot;how that outlook was modified in a direction away from characteristically medieval to embryonically modern attitudes.&quot; Green writes that Villani&#x27;s &quot;Cronica&quot; was one of three types of chronicles found in the 14th century, the type which was largely a universal history. Other types would be chronicles of particular historic episodes such as Dino Compagni&#x27;s account of the White Guelphs and Black Guelphs or the more domestic chronicle that focused on the fortunes and events of one family, as written by Donato Velluti or Giovanni Morelli.

<text>William Proudfoot, (February 21, 1859 – December 3, 1922) was an Ontario politician and barrister.

He was born in Colborne Township, Huron County, Canada West, the son of Robert Proudfoot, an immigrant from Scotland. He was educated in Goderich, studied law at Osgoode Hall and was called to the bar in 1880. Proudfoot set up practice in Goderich. He married Marion F. Dickson in 1886. In 1902, he was named King&#x27;s Counsel.

In 1908 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal. He was re-elected in 1911 and 1914. In 1917, he was chosen leader of the Liberal Party and, as such, became Leader of the Opposition in the legislature. Proudfoot was challenged as Liberal leader at the party&#x27;s first leadership convention in June 1919 and was replaced by Hartley Dewart. The 1919 election saw the Liberals and their allies drop from 30 seats to 27 with Proudfoot himself defeated in his riding of Huron Centre by the Labour candidate. No doubt due to Newton Rowell&#x27;s influence, he was then appointed to the Senate of Canada where he sat until his death in 1922.

Proudfoot&#x27;s grandnephew was Spencer Proudfoot Shotter, founder of what became the American Naval Stores Company.

The Highlanders take their name from the Scottish immigrants that founded the Otago, North Otago, and Southland regions in the 1840s and 1850s.

Their main ground through the 2011 Super Rugby season was Carisbrook in Dunedin, with home games occasionally being played in Invercargill and Queenstown. The Highlanders moved into Carisbrook&#x27;s replacement, Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza, for the 2012 season; the stadium opened in time for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, but after the Super Rugby season.

They finished the inaugural season eighth, and the following season finished last after winning only three of eleven matches. However, in the 1998, 1999 and 2000 seasons they qualified for semi-finals; hosting the 1999 competition final against fellow South Island team the Crusaders. They lost the match 24–19, and the following year were again knocked out by the Crusaders—this time in their semi-final. In the following fifteen seasons they would only finish in the top four once more, in 2002. But in 2015, they were crowned Super Rugby champions after beating the Hurricanes at Westpac Stadium .

Current Highlander, Aaron Smith has played a record 176 games for the Highlanders, and 47 other players have played over 50 games for the team. The Highlanders&#x27; highest career points scorer is Lima Sopoaga with 866 points, and highest career try scorer is Waisake Naholo with 45 tries.

==History==

The Highlanders&#x27; franchise was created as one of five New Zealand teams in the Super 12. Originally named the Otago Highlanders, the Highlanders&#x27; franchise area encompassed the lower South Island of New Zealand, and was formed from the North Otago, Otago, and Southland provincial rugby unions.

The 1996 team was captained by John Leslie and coached by Gordon Hunter. Their first Super 12 match was against the Queensland Reds at Carisbrook on 3 March 1996, whom they defeated 57–17. After three matches the Highlanders were undefeated and leading the competition. However the following week at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in South Africa they were defeated 59–29 by Northern Transvaal. They only won two more games that season, against at Carisbrook and against the Canterbury Crusaders at Lancaster Park, and they finished the season eighth on the table.

1997 was the least successful season ever for the Highlanders. They finished last in the competition, and managed only three wins. They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 75–43 loss to Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawless – a competition record. Following their last place in the 1997 season, Tony Gilbert was appointed as coach. Their first game under his guidance was an upset 26–19 win over the Queensland Reds. The Highlanders eventually became the first New Zealand side to defeat all four South African teams in one season. After defeating the Bulls at Loftus Versfeld they needed the Queensland Reds not to defeat the Brumbies by a large margin. Queensland were defeated by the Brumbies 23–16 and the Highlanders finished fourth, thus qualifying for the semi-finals. In the semi-final, they faced defending champions the Auckland Blues at Eden Park. The Blues were leading 20–16 at halftime, and were leading 30–26 before a controversial try to Adrian Cashmore pushed the Blues to a 37–26 lead. Joeli Vidiri had illegally taken out Highlander Stanley off the ball.

The following season in 1999 the Highlanders improved on their 1997 season record by reaching and hosting the tournament final. They opened their season with a 19–13 victory over the Auckland Blues at Carisbrook. This was followed by a victory over the Northern Bulls, the Stormers at Carisbrook, and the Cats, before their first loss of the season to the Sharks. They returned to New Zealand to defeat the Waikato Chiefs and then the Crusaders. After defeating the Reds, the Highlanders lost to the New South Wales Waratahs at Carisbrook. The next week they defeated the Brumbies at the same venue. In their next match, despite leading the Wellington Hurricanes 14–3 at half time, the Highlanders lost when Hurricanes half back Jason Spice scored in the corner to give the Hurricanes a 21–19 victory. Had the Highlanders won they would have finished top of the table and hosted a semi-final at Carisbrook. Instead they then had to travel to South Africa where they defeated the Stormers 33–18. The Highlanders travelled back to Dunedin for the 1999 Super 12 Final, which was against South Island rivals the Canterbury Crusaders, and was billed as &quot;the party at Tony Brown&#x27;s house&quot; after Highlanders first five-eighth Tony Brown. The Highlanders scored first, and led 14–9 at half time. However the decisive try was to Crusaders wing Afato So&#x27;oalo, who chipped the ball then out-sprinted All Blacks winger Jeff Wilson to collect the ball and score. Although the Highlanders scored a try to Isitolo Maka with three minutes remaining, the Crusaders won 24–19.

The Highlanders opened their 2000 season with a 50–13 victory over the Queensland Reds at Carisbrook. They won their next three matches, against the Sharks, Hurricanes and Cats. However they then lost their following three; against the Crusaders, Brumbies, and Blues. They played the Crusaders at Jade Stadium in their semi-final, and were defeated 37–15 after Marika Vunibaka scored two tries for the Crusaders in the last 20 minutes. The next season opened with a 23–8 victory over the Blues. Their 39–20 defeat of the Waratahs at Carisbrook on 7 April was the first defeat of New South Wales by an Otago-based side since the Otago provincial team defeated New South Wales 5–0 in 1901. The Highlanders narrowly lost to the Hurricanes in Napier 35–33 before defeating the Brumbies at Carisbrook on 20 April. Although the Highlanders went undefeated at home for a second consecutive season, they finished fifth with six wins that season.

Laurie Mains had returned from South Africa to coach Otago in the 2001 National Provincial Championship (NPC), and was appointed the Highlanders coach for 2002. Their season started with a narrow 30–28 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium. That year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams. The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before dying from cancer in 2001. The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 15–3 at half time, and eventually won 20–13. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders&#x27; 40–26 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. The Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch where they lost 34–23, although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.

The 2003 season started with a 29–16 win over the Chiefs in Hamilton. They then defeated the Stormers and Bulls before losing to the Cats in Johannesburg. Their second loss occurred when the Crusaders defeated them 17–16 at Carisbrook. The Highlanders had gone three seasons, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and 16 games unbeaten at Carisbrook before that loss. The Highlanders then defeated the Blues 22–11 to retain the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy. In April that year it was revealed a rift had developed between coach Laurie Mains and some of the senior players in the squad. Anton Oliver was branded the ringleader by Mains, and after their final game of the season Mains resigned and was replaced by his assistant Greg Cooper.

In contrast to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44 tries, twelve more than in 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not only did they have a new head coach, but also thirteen new players in their squad. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth that season. The Highlanders&#x27; 2005 season started with a loss to the Blues at Carisbrook. Following this the side won six games consecutively, the first time the franchise had ever done so. After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Three weeks from the end of the round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.

After ten years the Super 12 was expanded to include two extra teams; the Western Force from Australia, and the Cheetahs from South Africa. The expanded competition was renamed the Super 14. The Highlanders continued under Cooper in 2006. After losing their first match of 2006 to the Crusaders, they then won their next three. After only won two of their last six games, they finished the season ranked ninth. The 2007 ended with a similar result to 2006. The Highlanders again finished ninth on the table, and worst of the New Zealand teams. They finished the season with five wins and eight losses from their thirteen matches.
While the fortunes of the franchise had been declining for a few years, they would bottom out with a player exodus following the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The squad&#x27;s entire All Black front row of Carl Hayman, Anton Oliver, and Clarke Dermody left for lucrative contracts in Europe, while star first-five Nick Evans moved north to Auckland to play for the Blues, and hugely talented young lock James Ryan was forced to retire at age 24 due to injury problems. Joining the exodus were several other veteran starters, along with coach Greg Cooper who left the franchise to take up an assistant coaching position with the Blues. The coach for the 2008 season, Glenn Moore, was appointed 28 August 2007.

Moore was left with a weak side of young and inexperienced players which would stumble to a franchise-worst record of only 3 wins against 10 losses during the 2008 Super 14 season, and finished as the lowest-placed New Zealand team on the table. Jimmy Cowan, one of the team&#x27;s few bright spots through this period, was appointed team captain for 2009, but things would improve little over the following two seasons as the team again limped to the worst record of the New Zealand clubs. When Moore was released as coach following the 2010 season, the franchise had compiled a record of only 10 wins against 29 losses in three seasons under his leadership.

Former All Black Jamie Joseph was hired as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh replaced Cowan as team captain. The campaign would prove to be the franchise&#x27;s most successful in several years, as they raced out to a 3–0 start including a monumental away win over the Bulls in Pretoria. They remained in playoff contention for almost the entire season, sitting 8–4 at one juncture, before slumping under an injury cloud at the end of the year to finish 8th on the table.

Highlanders won the 2015 Super Rugby season defeating the Hurricanes 21–14 in Wellington. Phil Gifford called the win the &quot;greatest Super Rugby comeback this century&quot;.

In 2017, the Highlanders won over the British &amp; Irish Lions 23–22 at Dunedin, during the Lions tour to New Zealand.

2018 was a season of ups and downs for the Highlanders. They started their season 3–0 including a win over the defending champions Crusaders in Dunedin and finished their season in 6th place. Despite this, they would suffer a shock loss to the &quot;Waratahs&quot; after leading 23–3 at one point, they lost 30–23 in Sydney.

2019 was another up and down season for the Highlanders. At the end of the overall season the Highlanders had won 6, drawn 3 and lost 7, which somehow put them into 8th for the playoffs. However, they would lose to the Crusaders in that game (38–14)

After 7 rounds of the 2020 Super Rugby season, the Highlanders were 11th overall and 5th in the NZ conference. They were bound to play the Jaguares in round 7 but the COVID-19 pandemic suspended play of that game and cancelled the rest of the tournament. However, domestic Super Rugby competitions started up, and the one in New Zealand was Super Rugby Aotearoa. The Highlanders finished 4th in Super Rugby Aotearoa 2020 winning only 3 games, 2 of which were against the Chiefs (28–27) and (31–33) and one against the Hurricanes (38–21)

The 2021 season of Super Rugby Aotearoa saw the Highlanders finish 4th again, with 3 wins. They beat the Chiefs (23–39), Crusaders (12–33) and the Blues (35–29). After the season of Super Rugby Aotearoa finished, the Highlanders will partake in Super Rugby Trans-Tasman (competition between the NZ and Australian teams) in which they won all 5 of their games against Australian opposition, and went to the final against the Blues, which they lost 23–15.

2022 was one of the worst years ever for the Highlanders. The Highlanders were winless until Round 8, when they beat Moana Pasifika 37–17. After two more losses, things began to look up for them, beating the Drua 27–24, the Reds (27–19) and the Force (61–10) which put them in quarter-finals contention, since they had many losing bonus points alongside that. However, they lost their last two games of the regular season, and despite the final round loss to the Rebels (31–30) they only just made it into the quarters thanks to their losing bonus point. They ended up getting heavily beaten by the Blues in the quarter finals 35–6, ending the Highlanders worst season ever, with 4 games won from 14 in the regular season.

==Name and colours==

The name &quot;Highlanders&quot; was chosen after the early Scottish settlers in the lower South Island. These Scottish settlers were the founders of Dunedin—known as the &quot;Edinburgh of the South&quot;, and the city where the Highlanders are based. According to the Highlanders official website: &quot; The name and image of the Highlander conjures up visions of fierce independence, pride in one&#x27;s roots, loyalty, strength, kinship, honesty, and hard work.&quot;

The colours of the Highlanders formerly encompassed the provincial colours of North Otago, Otago, and Southland; yellow, blue and maroon. Blue is also the predominant colour of the Flag of Scotland, and is used by many sports teams in that country.

On 3 June 2011, the Highlanders introduced—controversially—a new predominantly lime green home kit. It was debuted in the Highlanders&#x27; final home match of the 2011 Super Rugby season.

Despite the resounding negative feedback from fans, this kit was initially confirmed for the 2012 season. On 6 September 2011, however, the club announced a change of heart—they would be returning to their traditional blue strip for home matches, and using the lime green kit for away matches during the 2012 Super Rugby season.

==Franchise area==

The Highlanders&#x27; franchise area consists of the region controlled by the North Otago, Otago and Southland Rugby Unions. Both Otago and Southland compete in the semi-professional Mitre 10 Cup (formerly the ITM Cup and Air New Zealand Cup), and North Otago in the amateur Heartland Championship.

==Stadiums==

Starting with the 2012 season, the Highlanders moved into the Forsyth Barr Stadium, opened in August 2011. It was built to replace their original home of Carisbrook, which was no longer suitable for international rugby, or as a venue for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The Carisbrook Stadium Trust was established in 2006 to manage the planning and construction of a new stadium. The new stadium is not on the current Carisbrook site, but instead near the University of Otago and Otago Harbour. It is a roofed, all weather stadium with a rectangular configuration, and permanent seating capacity of 25,000 that could be expanded to 30,748 if necessary.

The Highlanders&#x27; original home ground was the 29,000 capacity Carisbrook in Dunedin. Carisbrook is also known as &quot;The Brook&quot;, or as &quot;The House of Pain&quot; due to its reputation as a difficult venue to visit. The stadium was also well known for Dunedin&#x27;s large student population (known as &quot;Scarfies&quot;) that occupied the terraces—an uncovered concrete embankment at the eastern end of the ground.

The Highlanders usually play at least one regular season match outside of Dunedin, at either Rugby Park in Invercargill or the Queenstown Events Centre in Queenstown. Prior to 2007 the regular season match was usually played at Rugby Park, however in 2007 they played a match at the Queenstown Events Centre. The Highlanders have also played pre-season matches at Centennial Park in Oamaru and at the Showgrounds in Balclutha.

On 28 March 2009, the Highlanders played a home game at FMG Stadium in Palmerston North against the Bulls. This game attracted a crowd of 10,000; one of the Highlanders&#x27; biggest of the 2009 season.

==Development team==
The Highlanders have fielded a development team in competitions such as the Pacific Rugby Cup and in matches against other representative teams for several seasons. Known as the Highlanders Development XV, the squad is selected from the best emerging rugby talent in the Highlanders catchment area and is composed of Highlanders contracted players, wider training group members, under 20s, and selected club players.

==Coaches and management==
In their first season the Highlanders were coached by Gordon Hunter before he joined the All Blacks selection panel. Glenn Ross took over in 1997, and was not reappointed for the 1998 season. Tony Gilbert was appointed for the 1998 season, and again coached the team in 1999 before being appointed co-coach for the All Blacks. Peter Sloane was appointed Gilbert&#x27;s successor for the 2000 season, and also coached them in 2001 before moving to coach the Blues. Laurie Mains returned to New Zealand from South Africa to replace Sloane for the 2002 season. Mains resigned following the 2003 season after a rift between him and senior players. Greg Cooper replaced Mains and coached the team from 2003 until 2007, when he left the franchise to take up the assistant coaches position with the Blues. Glenn Moore coached the club from 2008 through until 2010, when he was relieved of his duties after the club posted only 10 wins against 29 losses in his three years in charge. His replacement was former All Black flanker Jamie Joseph, who coached between 2011 and 2016. Tony Brown took over as head coach in 2017 he then left to join Joseph in Japan and was replaced by Aaron Mauger who coached between 2018 and 2020. Tony Brown again took over as head coach for 2021 and 2022.

On 21 June 2022, the Highlanders announced that Clarke Dermody had been appointed as head coach of the franchise for a period of three years (2023–2025).

In July 2024 it was announced that Jamie Joseph would replace Clarke Dermody as Head Coach with Dermody stepping back to an Assistant Coach role.

<text>Sam Kieth (born January 11, 1963) is an American comics artist and writer, best known as the creator of &quot;The Maxx&quot; and &quot;Zero Girl&quot;.

==Career==
===Comics===
Kieth&#x27;s first published work was &quot;a story in the back of a comic&quot; when he was &quot;about seventeen&quot;; it was &quot;about a killer rabbit named Max the Hare&quot;. He came to prominence in 1984 as the inker of Matt Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Mage&quot;, and a year later as the inker of &quot;Fish Police&quot;. In 1989, he penciled the first five issues (the &quot;Preludes &amp; Nocturnes&quot; story arc) of writer Neil Gaiman&#x27;s celebrated series &quot;The Sandman&quot; and collaborated with Alan Grant on a Penguin story in &quot;Secret Origins Special&quot; #1. He illustrated two volumes of writer William Messner-Loebs&#x27; &quot;Epicurus the Sage&quot;, drew an &quot;Aliens&quot; miniseries for Dark Horse Comics, and drew &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #368, which led to drawing numerous covers for &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;.

In 1993, Kieth left Marvel to create the original series &quot;The Maxx&quot; for fledgling publisher Image Comics. &quot;The Maxx&quot; ran 35 issues, all of which were plotted and illustrated by Kieth. William Messner-Loebs scripted #1–15 and Alan Moore wrote #21. In 1995, &quot;The Maxx&quot; was adapted as part of MTV&#x27;s short-lived animation series &quot;MTV&#x27;s Oddities&quot;.

After taking a break from comics to pursue other interests, Kieth created the series &quot;Zero Girl&quot; for DC Comics&#x27; Wildstorm imprint in 2001. He followed that with the drama &quot;Four Women&quot; later that year and &quot;Zero Girl: Full Circle&quot; in 2003. In August 2004, he launched the &quot;Scratch&quot; series featuring a teenage werewolf.

Kieth then wrote and drew the five-issue series &quot;Batman: Secrets&quot;, featuring the Joker, and &quot;Batman/Lobo: Deadly Serious&quot;, a two-issue miniseries starting in August 2007. This was followed by 2009&#x27;s &quot;Lobo: Highway to Hell&quot;, written by Scott Ian of the band Anthrax, and the painted story &quot;Ghosts&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Batman Confidential&quot; #40–43. In 2010, Kieth wrote and illustrated the original hardcover graphic novel &quot;Arkham Asylum: Madness&quot;, which spent two weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, reaching number five in the category of &quot;Hardcover Graphic Books&quot;.

&quot;Ojo&quot; comprises the first, and &quot;My Inner Bimbo&quot; the second, in a cycle of original limited series or graphic novels published by Oni Press, which he dubbed &quot;The Trout-a-Verse&quot;. The cycle concerned the intertwined lives of Annie (&quot;Ojo&quot;), Lo (&quot;My Inner Bimbo&quot;), Dana, Nola, Otto, and others all connected by an encounter with an urban legend known as the Magic Trout.

In the UK, he has contributed to &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; and provided several covers for the &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot; reprint title. In 2011, Kieth began drawing IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;30 Days of Night&quot; series. IDW released the 48-page &quot;The Sam Kieth Sketchbooks: Vol. 1&quot;, followed by a second volume in August 2010.

===Other media===
In addition to co-producing &quot;The Maxx&quot; animated series for MTV, Kieth co-wrote &quot;No Smoking&quot;, the pilot to &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot; (created by his cousin, David Feiss), and directed the film &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot; (2000) for Roger Corman&#x27;s Concorde-New Horizons.

<text>Samuel Keith (September 14, 1921 — March 28, 2003) was an American writer and educator. His most notable work was the 1973 best seller &quot;One Man&#x27;s Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey&quot;, in which he edited and expanded on the journals of his friend Richard Proenneke&#x27;s solo experiences in Alaska to create an Alaskan classic. In 2014, Keith&#x27;s formerly lost manuscript &quot;First Wilderness: My Quest in the Territory of Alaska&quot; was published.

Born in Plainfield, New Hampshire, in 1921, Sam Keith was the son of a wildlife artist, Merle Vincent Keith. As a teen, Keith joined the Civilian Conservation Corps and served in Elgin, Oregon, building roads. During World War II, Keith enlisted in the Marines, where he served as a radio gunner. He was shot down over the Pacific. He enrolled at Cornell University after the war on the GI Bill and graduated with a degree in English, with an eye toward being a writer. In 1953, Keith left his Massachusetts home to seek adventure in Alaska. He found a job as a laborer on the Kodiak Naval Base, and there met Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Proenneke, who was working as a diesel mechanic. The two became friends, and during their time in Alaska went on numerous hunting and fishing trips together. After several years, Keith returned to Massachusetts in the 1960s, where he married and became an English teacher at Silver Lake Regional High School in Kingston, writing on the side. During a trip to visit Dick Proenneke at his cabin in Twin Lakes in 1970, Keith suggested that he take Proenneke&#x27;s journals describing the time he spent building a cabin on the shores of Twin Lakes, Alaska, and turn them into a book.

Keith wrote &quot;One Man&#x27;s Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey&quot; (1973) based on his lifelong friend&#x27;s journals and photography. Re-released in 1999, it became a best seller and won a National Outdoor Book Award. Book excerpts and some of Proenneke&#x27;s 16mm movies were used in the popular documentary &quot;Alone in the Wilderness&quot;, which continues to air on PBS. The two remained good friends, trading hundreds of letters over their lifetimes. The men died within a month of each other in 2003.

Ten years later, Keith&#x27;s son-in-law, children&#x27;s book author/illustrator Brian Lies, discovered an unpublished manuscript by Keith in an archive box in their garage. Forty years after it was written, the story of Keith&#x27;s own Alaska experiences was published. Included are photos and excerpts from his journals, letters, and notebooks.

<text>Stipa is a genus of around 300 large perennial hermaphroditic grasses collectively known as feather grass, needle grass, and spear grass. They are placed in the subfamily Pooideae and the tribe Stipeae, which also contains many species formerly assigned to &quot;Stipa&quot;, which have since been reclassified into new genera.

Many species are important forage crops. Several species such as &quot;Stipa brachytricha&quot;, &quot;S. arundinacea&quot;, &quot;S. splendens&quot;, &quot;S. calamagrostis&quot;, &quot;S. gigantea&quot; and &quot;S. pulchra&quot; are used as ornamental plants. One former species, esparto grass (&quot;Macrochloa tenacissima&quot;), is used for crafts and extensively in paper making.

It is a coarse grass with inrolled leaves and a panicle patterned inflorescence.

==Ecology==
Species of the genus &quot;Stipa&quot; can occur in grasslands or in savanna habitats. Certain specific prairie plant associations are dominated by grasses of the genus &quot;Stipa&quot;, which genus often lends its name to the terminology of some prairie types. In some areas of the western United States grasses of the genus &quot;Stipa&quot; form a significant part of the understory of Blue Oak savannas, and were even a more important element prehistorically before the invasion of many European grasses.

<text>Anomochilidae is a family of snakes with one genus, Anomochilus, containing three species of snake. Members of the genus are known as anomochilids, or by the common names dwarf pipesnakes, lesser pipesnakes, and giant blind snakes. Initially created as &quot;Anomalochilus&quot; in 1890 for the species &quot;A. weberi&quot;, the genus was renamed in 1901 because the original name was already in use for a genus of beetles. Dwarf pipesnakes are small and cylindrical, with short, conical tails and small, rounded heads that are continuous with the neck. They have blackish to purplish-brown uppersides and dark brown or black undersides, with orange-red bands around the tail and a variety of pale markings on the snout and belly. All three species of dwarf pipesnake are endemic to Sundaland, where they are found on the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Sumatra and Borneo.

Adapted to living underground, dwarf pipesnakes inhabit leaf litter in lowland and montane rainforests at elevations of . They are poorly studied and little is known about their diets and reproductive habits. They probably feed on earthworms, snakes, and legless lizards, and uniquely within their superfamily, lay eggs to give birth. Two species of dwarf pipesnake, &quot;A. weberi&quot; and &quot;monticola&quot;, are classified as being Data Deficient by the IUCN, while the third species, &quot;A. leonardi&quot;, is classified as being of Least Concern.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Anomochilus&quot; was erected by the Dutch herpetologist Theodorus Willem van Lidth de Jeude in 1890 as &quot;Anomalochilus&quot; for the species &quot;Anomalochilus weberi&quot;, which he described on the basis of a female specimen from Sumatra. In 1901, the naturalist Charles Berg renamed the genus to &quot;Anomochilus&quot;, as the name &quot;Anomalochilus&quot; was already in use for a genus of beetles. A second species of the genus, &quot;A. leonardi&quot;, was described by the British herpetologist Malcolm Arthur Smith in 1940 from two specimens collected in Pahang, Malaysia. The third species in the genus, &quot;A. monticola&quot;, was described by the Indian herpetologist and colleagues in 2008, based on specimens collected from Mount Kinabalu on Borneo.

&quot;Anomochilus&quot; was initially described in the family &quot;Tortriciidae&quot;, which was later synonymized with the family Cylindrophiidae. Subsequently, it was moved to Aniliidae, before being placed in Uropeltidae by the American herpetologist Samuel Booker McDowell Jr. in 1975. In 1993, the American herpetologist and colleagues split the Uropeltidae into three families, reinstating Cylindrophiidae and moving &quot;Anomochilus&quot; into its own monogeneric family, Anomochilidae. Subsequent genetic studies have shown that Cylindrophiidae is likely paraphyletic (not containing all the descendants of a common ancestor) with respect to Anomochilidae, and a 2022 study recommended placing &quot;Anomochilus&quot; back in the former family.

&quot;Anomochilus&quot; contains three species of pipesnake. All three species are known to live on the island of Borneo, which is presumed to be the center of diversification for the genus. The genus is closely related to the family Cylindrophiidae, which it is sometimes placed in, and these two form a clade most closely related to the Uropeltidae. The following cladogram shows phylogenetic relationships of Anomochiliidae with other families, based on the 2022 study:

== Description ==

Dwarf pipesnakes are small and cylindrical snakes, with a small, rounded head and short, conical tail. The head is continuous with the neck and, despite the fossorial nature of the species, the snout has no reinforcements to aid in burrowing. The uppersides are usually uniform blackish to purplish-brown and the undersides are dark brown or black, the latter frequently being marked by yellow or white blotches. The snout has yellow markings and the tail is bounded by an orange or red band. 

They can be differentiated from other snakes outside of the genus by their small head and eyes, the large scales on the forehead, a single nasal scale bordering the second supralabial scale, the absence of the loreal and preocular scales, a lone postocular scale, and the lack of a mental groove. Additionally, the dentition of dwarf pipesnakes is unique among snakes: members of the family have no teeth on the pterygoid and palatine bones, and only four diagonally oriented maxillary teeth.



==Distribution and habitat==
All three species of dwarf pipesnake are endemic to Sundaland, where they are found on the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. &quot;A. leonardi&quot; inhabits the Malay Peninsula and Sabah in Malaysian Borneo, while &quot;A. weberi&quot; is found on Sumatra and Kalimantan on Borneo. &quot;A. monticola&quot; is currently known only from Kinabalu Park in Sabah. Dwarf pipesnakes are fossorial and inhabit leaf litter in lowland and montane rainforests, frequently near creeks. &quot;A. leonardi&quot; inhabits plains and low hill forest at elevations of , &quot;A. monticola&quot; inhabits montane forest at elevations of , and &quot;A. weberi&quot; inhabits montane forest at elevations of .

== Ecology and behaviour ==
Dwarf pipesnakes are fossorial (adapted to living underground). Their ecology is poorly studied and little is known about their diets and reproductive habits. Their small mouths, truncated quadrate bones (the length of which allows other snakes to swallow large prey), and lack of the mental groove (which enables other species to expand their lower jaw) suggests that their diet consists of elongate invertebrates like earthworms and perhaps also of small, slim vertebrates like snakes and legless lizards. &quot;A. weberi&quot; is known to lay clutches of four eggs, but reproduction in the other species is undescribed. Dwarf pipesnakes are the only uropeltoids that lay eggs; all other uropeltoids give birth to live young.

== Status ==
Two species of dwarf pipesnake, &quot;A. weberi&quot; and &quot;monticola&quot;, are classified as being Data Deficient by the IUCN, while the third species, &quot;A. leonardi&quot;, is classified as being of Least Concern. All three species are known from a very small number of specimens and consequently do not have population estimates or well-defined ranges. &quot;A. monticola&quot; and &quot;leonardi&quot; are known from the protected areas of Kinabalu Park and Taman Negara, respectively. Little is known about threats facing the genus, although &quot;A. weberi&quot; is thought to be threatened by habitat loss caused by logging and urbanisation.

* List of differential geometry topics

Unless stated otherwise, letters &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; below denote metric spaces, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot; denote Riemannian manifolds, |&quot;xy&quot;| or formula_1 denotes the distance between points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. Italic &quot;word&quot; denotes a self-reference to this glossary.

&quot;A caveat&quot;: many terms in Riemannian and metric geometry, such as &quot;convex function&quot;, &quot;convex set&quot; and others, do not have exactly the same meaning as in general mathematical usage.

Conformal map is a map which preserves angles.

Conformally flat a manifold &quot;M&quot; is conformally flat if it is locally conformally equivalent to a Euclidean space, for example standard sphere is conformally flat.

Conjugate points two points &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; on a geodesic formula_10 are called conjugate if there is a Jacobi field on formula_10 which has a zero at &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.

Connection

Convex function. A function &quot;f&quot; on a Riemannian manifold is a convex if for any geodesic formula_10 the function formula_13 is convex. A function &quot;f&quot; is called formula_14-convex if for any geodesic formula_10 with natural parameter formula_16, the function formula_17 is convex.

Convex A subset &quot;K&quot; of a Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot; is called convex if for any two points in &quot;K&quot; there is a unique &quot;shortest path&quot; connecting them which lies entirely in &quot;K,&quot; see also &quot;totally convex&quot;.

Convexity radius at a point formula_18 of a Riemannian manifold is the supremum of radii of balls centered at formula_18 that are &quot;(totally) convex&quot;. The convexity radius of the manifold is the infimum of the convexity radii at its points; for a compact manifold this is a positive number. Sometimes the additional requirement is made that the distance function to formula_18 in these balls is convex.

Injectivity radius The injectivity radius at a point &quot;p&quot; of a Riemannian manifold is the supremum of radii for which the exponential map at &quot;p&quot; is a diffeomorphism. The injectivity radius of a Riemannian manifold is the infimum of the injectivity radii at all points. See also cut locus.

For complete manifolds, if the injectivity radius at &quot;p&quot; is a finite number &quot;r&quot;, then either there is a geodesic of length 2&quot;r&quot; which starts and ends at &quot;p&quot; or there is a point &quot;q&quot; conjugate to &quot;p&quot; (see conjugate point above) and on the distance &quot;r&quot; from &quot;p&quot;. For a closed Riemannian manifold the injectivity radius is either half the minimal length of a closed geodesic or the minimal distance between conjugate points on a geodesic.

An orbit space of &quot;N&quot; by a discrete subgroup of formula_24 which acts freely on &quot;N&quot; is called an &quot;infranilmanifold&quot;. An infranilmanifold is finitely covered by a nilmanifold.

Isometric embedding is an embedding preserving the Riemannian metric.

and every point in &quot;Y&quot; has distance at most &quot;C&quot; from some point of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). Note that a quasi-isometry is not assumed to be continuous. For example, any map between compact metric spaces is a quasi isometry. If there exists a quasi-isometry from X to Y, then X and Y are said to be quasi-isometric.

== R ==

Radius of metric space is the infimum of radii of metric balls which contain the space completely.

Ray is a one side infinite geodesic which is minimizing on each interval.

Ricci curvature

Riemann The mathematician after whom &quot;Riemannian geometry&quot; is named.

Riemannian angle

Riemann curvature tensor is often defined as the (4, 0)-tensor of the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold formula_53 asformula_54for formula_55 and formula_56 (depending on conventions, formula_25 and formula_58 are sometimes switched).

Riemannian hyperbolic space

Riemannian manifold

Riemannian submanifold A differentiable sub-manifold whose Riemannian metric is the restriction of the ambient Riemannian metric (not to be confused with &quot;sub-Riemannian manifold&quot;).

Riemannian submersion is a map between Riemannian manifolds which is submersion and &quot;submetry&quot; at the same time.

== S ==

Scalar curvature

Second fundamental form is a quadratic form on the tangent space of hypersurface, usually denoted by II, an equivalent way to describe the &quot;shape operator&quot; of a hypersurface, 
:formula_59
It can be also generalized to arbitrary codimension, in which case it is a quadratic form with values in the normal space.

Sectional curvature at a point formula_18 of a Riemannian manifold formula_61 along the 2-plane spanned by two linearly independent vectors formula_62 is the numberformula_63where formula_64 is the &quot;curvature tensor&quot; written as formula_65, and formula_66 is the Riemannian metric.

Shape operator for a hypersurface &quot;M&quot; is a linear operator on tangent spaces, &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;: &quot;T&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;M&quot;→&quot;T&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;M&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; is a unit normal field to &quot;M&quot; and &quot;v&quot; is a tangent vector then

(there is no standard agreement whether to use + or − in the definition).

Short map is a distance non increasing map.

Smooth manifold

Sol manifold is a factor of a connected solvable Lie group by a lattice.

Spherical geometry

Submetry A short map &quot;f&quot; between metric spaces is called a submetry if there exists &quot;R &gt; 0&quot; such that for any point &quot;x&quot; and radius &quot;r &lt; R&quot; the image of metric &quot;r&quot;-ball is an &quot;r&quot;-ball, i.e.formula_68Sub-Riemannian manifold

Symmetric space Riemannian symmetric spaces are Riemannian manifolds in which the geodesic reflection at any point is an isometry. They turn out to be quotients of a real Lie group by a maximal compact subgroup whose Lie algebra is the fixed subalgebra of the involution obtained by differentiating the geodesic symmetry. This algebraic data is enough to provide a classification of the Riemannian symmetric spaces.

Systole The &quot;k&quot;-systole of &quot;M&quot;, formula_69, is the minimal volume of &quot;k&quot;-cycle nonhomologous to zero.

Thurston&#x27;s geometries The eight 3-dimensional geometries predicted by Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture, proved by Perelman: formula_70, formula_71, formula_72, formula_73, formula_74, formula_75, formula_76, and formula_77.

Tits boundary

Totally convex A subset &quot;K&quot; of a Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot; is called totally convex if for any two points in &quot;K&quot; any geodesic connecting them lies entirely in &quot;K&quot;, see also &quot;convex&quot;.

Totally geodesic submanifold is a &quot;submanifold&quot; such that all &quot;geodesics&quot; in the submanifold are also geodesics of the surrounding manifold.

Tree-graded space

== U ==

Uniquely geodesic metric space is a metric space where any two points are the endpoints of a unique minimizing geodesic.

<text>The or Shield Society was a private militia in Japan dedicated to traditional Japanese values and veneration of the Emperor. It was founded and led by author Yukio Mishima. The private militia was officially founded in 1968 for the purpose of preventing indirect aggression by proponents of foreign ideology seeking to destroy Japanese traditional culture, and protecting the dignity of the Emperor as a symbol of Japan&#x27;s national identity.

The name of Tatenokai comes from two classical &quot;waka&quot;, one from the 7th century Asuka period and the other from the 19th century Edo period, which express the determination to become a shield to protect the Emperor.

== Background ==
The Tatenokai was a militia organization that took over from its predecessor, the , which was founded in 1967. The original members were the staff of New Right monthly magazine and several Waseda University students. They had enlisted in the Japan Self-Defense Forces with Yukio Mishima in 1967, and after changing its name to Tatenokai, the group gradually increased its membership by allowing new students to enlist in the JSDF.

The Tatenokai was officially founded on October 5, 1968. Mishima decided to increase the size of the private army due to his growing alarm over the scale of left-wing protests in Japan and to this end placed recruitment advertisements in right-wing newspapers. Membership ultimately rose to 100 members, most of whom were students at Waseda University. Along with outdoor activities, the members, who joined voluntarily, were subjected to rigorous physical training that included kendo and long-distance running.

== Origin of the Name ==
The name &quot;Tatenokai&quot; (楯の会) was inspired by two traditional Japanese &quot;waka&quot; poems: A poem from the series included in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, and a poem by 19th century poet Tachibana Akemi.

==1970 coup attempt==
On November 25, 1970 Mishima and four Tatenokai members briefly seized control of the Self-Defense Force&#x27;s headquarters and attempted to rally the soldiers to stage a coup d&#x27;état and restore imperial rule. When this failed, Mishima and Masakatsu Morita, the Tatenokai&#x27;s main student leader, committed &quot;seppuku&quot; (ritual suicide). The rest of the members, around 90 people, were not informed about Mishima&#x27;s plan at all.

===Participants===
*Yukio Mishima, leader
*Hiroyasu Koga, Kanagawa University
*Masayoshi Koga, Kanagawa University
*Masakatsu Morita, Waseda University
*Masahiro Ogawa, Meiji Gakuin University

==Inspired events==
On 3 March 1977, four Japanese nationalists took 12 hostages at the Keidanren Kaikan (headquarters of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations), spreading leaflets at the scene that denounced big business. The hostages were released, unharmed, after an eleven-hour standoff during which the hostage-takers spoke for more than three hours to Mishima&#x27;s widow, Yōko. Two of the hostage-takers – Yoshio Ito and Shunichi Nishio – were former members of the Tatenokai.

<doc id="490866" wikidata="Q1129232" url="?curid=490866" title="Controlled flight into terrain">
<text>In aviation, a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT; usually ) is an accident in which an airworthy aircraft, fully under pilot control, is unintentionally flown into the ground, a body of water or other obstacle. In a typical CFIT scenario, the crew is unaware of the impending collision until impact, or it is too late to avert. The term was coined by engineers at Boeing in the late 1970s.

Accidents where the aircraft is out of control at the time of impact, because of mechanical failure or pilot error, are classified instead as uncontrolled flight into terrain, or UFIT. Incidents resulting from the deliberate action of the person at the controls, such as a forced landing, an act of terrorism, or suicide by pilot, are also excluded from the definition of CFIT.

According to Boeing in 1997, CFIT was a leading cause of airplane accidents involving the loss of life, causing over 9,000 deaths since the beginning of the commercial jet aircraft era. CFIT was identified as a cause of 25% of USAF Class A mishaps between 1993 and 2002. According to data collected by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) between 2008 and 2017, CFITs accounted for six percent of all commercial aircraft accidents, and was categorized as &quot;the second-highest fatal accident category after Loss of Control Inflight (LOC-I)&quot;.

==Causes==
While there are many reasons why an aircraft might crash into terrain, including poor weather and navigational equipment failure, pilot error is the most common factor found in CFIT accidents.

Behind such events there is often a loss of situational awareness by the pilot, who becomes unaware of their actual position and altitude in relation to the terrain below and immediately ahead of them. Fatigue can cause even highly experienced professionals to make significant errors, which culminate in a CFIT accident.

CFIT accidents frequently involve a collision with terrain such as hills or mountains or tall artificial obstacles such as radio towers during conditions of reduced visibility while approaching or departing from an airport. A contributing factor can be subtle navigation equipment malfunctions which, if not detected by the crew, may mislead them into improperly guiding the aircraft despite other information received from properly functioning equipment. CFIT is a constant hazard during aerial application, close air support, and aerial firefighting operations, which involve routine low-altitude flight along varying routes over terrain that may be unfamiliar to the pilots.

==Solutions==
Before the installation of the first electronic terrain warning systems, the only defenses against CFIT were conventional see-and-avoid aviation practices, pilot simulator training, crew resource management (CRM) and radar surveillance by air traffic services. While refinements applied to those practices helped reduce the incidence of CFIT accidents, they did not eliminate them. 

To further assist in preventing CFIT accidents, manufacturers developed terrain awareness and warning systems (TAWS). The first generation of those systems was known as a ground proximity warning system (GPWS), which used a radar altimeter to assist in calculating terrain closure rates. That system was further improved with the addition of a GPS terrain database and is now known as an enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS). When combined with mandatory pilot simulator training which emphasizes proper responses to any caution or warning event, the system has proved very effective in preventing further CFIT accidents.

Smaller aircraft often use a GPS database of terrain to provide terrain warning. The GPS database contains a database of nearby terrain and will present terrain that is near the aircraft in red or yellow depending on its distance from the aircraft.

The sterile flight deck rule was implemented to limit pilot distraction by banning any non-essential activities in the cockpit during critical phases of the flight, such as when operating at below .

<text>Herbert Hartley Dewart QC (9 November 1861 – 7 July 1924) was an Ontario lawyer and politician.

==Early life and education==

Dewart was born in St. Johns, Canada East, on 9 November 1861. His father was Edward Hartley Dewart, an Irish Methodist minister who was a preacher in St. Johns. His mother was Dorothy Matilda Hunt. In 1865 Dewart and his family moved to Toronto. He attended Toronto&#x27;s model school and collegiate institute. He studied at the University of Toronto, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1883, and Osgoode Hall, being called to the Ontario bar in 1887. He co-founded the Young Men&#x27;s Liberal Club and was its president from 1887 to 1888.

==Early career==

Dewart set up practice in Toronto and served as crown attorney for York County from 1891 to 1904. In 1895, he replaced Britton Bath Osler as the prosecutor for the murder trial of Clara Ford after Osler&#x27;s wife died. The trial was a media sensation and Dewart&#x27;s oratory skills trial impressed members of the press and fellow lawyers. Even though Ford confessed to the crime, Dewart lost the case when the jury decided to acquit. He was appointed as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1899 and continued his work as a public prosecutor until his resignation in 1904.

Dewart next worked as a lawyer in private practice, working both civil and criminal cases. He was also the solicitor for several corporations such as the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1906, he was elected to the University of Toronto&#x27;s senate and was an examiner in English. In 1911 he was elected as a bencher to the Law Society of Ontario.

==Political career==

Dewart&#x27;s first election was in 1904 as a Liberal candidate for the Toronto South constituency during the federal election, but he was defeated. In 1911 he failed in his second attempt to be elected to the Canadian parliament, this time for the constituency of York Centre.

He was first elected to the provincial legislature in a 1916 by-election after the death of James Joseph Foy in the Toronto Southwest electoral district, becoming the first Liberal to win a Toronto seat in a quarter-century. As a politician he stated his opposition to prohibition and publicly spoke against the Liberal party&#x27;s temperance policies, to the chagrin of the leader of the Liberal party, Newton Wesley Rowell. He was also against conscription, stating that it was unconstitutional.

In June 1919, he became leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. During his time as leader, the Liberal Party was divided over the question of prohibition and the conflict between the interests of rural and urban voters. In the 1919 Ontario general election, Dewart campaigned by attacking the Ontario Conservative Party campaign manager Howard Ferguson. However, rural voters supported the United Farmers of Ontario Party, causing the United Farmers to win the election. In the subsequent legislature, Dewart criticised the United Farmer government, causing more discontent among rural Ontarians. He resigned as leader of the Liberal party in 1921, citing poor health.

Dewart continued sitting as a legislator. He opposed a bill that would tax racetrack bets, dramatically asking the lieutenant governor before the bill received royal assent if the bill was constitutional. He was defeated in the 1923 Ontario general election.

==Later career and death==

After his election loss, he returned to private practice and was appointed to a commission that was to consolidate Canadian statutes. He died at his home near Uxbridge in 1924; the cause of death outlined in his obituaries was overwork. He was buried in Toronto Necropolis.

<text>The Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force (Aviazione Cobelligerante Italiana, or ACI), or Air Force of the South (Aeronautica del Sud), was the air force of the Royalist &quot;Badoglio government&quot; in Southern Italy during the last years of World War II. The ACI was formed in Southern Italy in October 1943 after the Italian Armistice in September. As by this point the Italian Kingdom had defected from the Axis and had declared war on Germany, the ACI pilots flew for the Allies.

A small part of the Italian Royal Air Force (&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;) remained under German control. This was known as the National Republican Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana&quot;, or ANR), ostensibly part of the forces of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist state in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (&quot;Repubblica Sociale Italiana&quot;). The ANR pilots flew with the Axis.

By the end of 1943, 281 Italian warplanes had landed at Allied airfields, but most were no longer useful for combat. The crews of these aircraft were re-equipped with Allied aircraft and engaged in transport, escort, reconnaissance, sea rescue, and limited tactical ground support operations flying 11,000 missions from 1943 to 1945.

The ACI never operated over Italian territory, its objectives being always in the Balkans (Yugoslavia or Albania). This was to avoid any possible encounter between Italian-crewed aircraft fighting on opposite sides. During the entire history of ACI, no encounter, let alone combat, was ever reported between ACI and ANR aircraft.

The ACI formed the basis of the post-war Air Force of the Italian Republic (&quot;Aeronautica Militare Italiana&quot;).

<text>The ngultrum ( or ; , , ; symbol: Nu., code: BTN) is the currency of the Kingdom of Bhutan. It is subdivided into 100 chhertum (, , ; spelled as &quot;chetrums&quot; on coins until 1979). The Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan, the central bank of Bhutan, is the minting authority of the ngultrum banknotes and coins. The ngultrum is currently pegged to the Indian rupee at parity.

==History==

Until 1789, the coins of the Cooch Behar mint circulated in Bhutan. Following this, Bhutan began issuing its own coins known as &quot;chetrum&quot;, mostly silver rupees. Hammered silver and copper coins were the only types issued until 1929, when modern style silver rupee coins were introduced, followed by bronze 1 paisa in 1931 (dated 1928). Nickel rupee coins were introduced in 1950. While the Cooch Behar mint coins circulated alongside Bhutan&#x27;s own coins, decimalization was introduced in 1957, when Bhutan&#x27;s first issue of coins denominated in naya paisa. The 1966 issues were 25 naya paisa, 50 naya paisa and 1 rupee coins, struck in cupro-nickel.

While the Bhutanese government developed its economy in the early 1960s, monetization in 1968 led to the establishment of the Bank of Bhutan. As monetary reforms took place in 1974, the Ngultrum was officially introduced as 100 Chhetrum equal to 1 Ngultrum. The Ngultrum retained the peg to the Indian rupee at par, which the Bhutanese coins had maintained.

The term derives from the Dzongkha &quot;ngul&quot;, &quot;silver&quot; and &quot;trum&quot;, a Hindi loanword meaning &quot;money.&quot;

The Ministry of Finance issued its first banknotes in 1974 in denominations of Nu.1, Nu.5, Nu.10 and Nu.100. This was followed by the establishment of the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan as the central bank of Bhutan in 1982, which took over the authority to issue banknotes in 1983, replacing the authority of the Ministry of Finance.

==Coins==
In 1974, aluminum Ch.5 and Ch.10, aluminium-bronze Ch.20, and cupro-nickel Ch.25 and Nu.1 were introduced. The Ch.5 was square and the Ch.10 was scallop-shaped. A new coinage was introduced in 1979, consisting of bronze Ch.5 and Ch.10, and cupro-nickel Ch.25 and Ch.50 and Nu.1 and Nu.3. Aluminium-bronze Ch.25 was also issued dated 1979. Ch.5 and Ch.10 have largely ceased circulating. Currently, coins are available in denominations of Ch.20, Ch.25, Ch.50 and Nu.1.

==Banknotes==
===Previous series===
On June 2, 1974, Nu.1, Nu.5 and Nu.10 notes were introduced by the Royal Government of Bhutan, followed by Nu.2, Nu.20, Nu.50, and Nu.100 in 1978. On August 4, 1982, the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan Act was enacted, although the RMA did not begin operations until November 1, 1983, and did not issue its own family of notes until 1986.

===Present series===

In 2006, the Monetary Authority introduced its latest series of notes, with denominations of Nu.1, Nu.5, Nu.10, Nu.20, Nu.50, Nu.100, Nu.500, and Nu.1000. These notes use a hybrid substrate.

<text>Violales is a botanical name of an order of flowering plants and takes its name from the included family Violaceae; it was proposed by Lindley (1853). The name has been used in several systems, although some systems used the name Parietales for similar groupings. In the 1981 version of the influential Cronquist system, order Violales was placed in subclass Dilleniidae with a consisting of the families listed below. Some classifications such as that of Dahlgren placed the Violales in the superorder Violiflorae (also called Violanae).

<doc id="490901" wikidata="Q588332" url="?curid=490901" title="Catch and release">
<text>Catch and release is a practice within recreational fishing where after capture, often a fast measurement and weighing of the fish is performed, followed by posed photography as proof of the catch, and then the fish are unhooked and returned live to the water. Using barbless hooks, it is often possible to release the fish without removing it from the water (a slack line is frequently sufficient).

Catch and release is a conservation practice developed to prevent overharvest of fish stocks in the face of growing human populations, mounting ecological pressure, increasingly effective fishing tackle and techniques, inadequate fishing regulations and enforcement, and habitat degradation. Sports fishers have been practicing catch and release for decades, including with some highly pressured fish species.

==History==

In the United Kingdom, catch and release has been performed for more than a century by coarse fishermen in order to prevent target species from disappearing in heavily fished waters. Since the latter part of the 20th century, many salmon and sea trout rivers have been converted to complete or partial catch and release. In Scotland, the River Dee operates a full catch and release policy for salmon, grilse and sea trout.

In the United States, catch and release was first introduced as a management tool in the state of Michigan in 1952 as an effort to reduce the cost of stocking hatchery-raised trout. Anglers fishing for fun rather than for food accepted the idea of releasing the fish while fishing in &quot;no-kill&quot; zones. Conservationists have advocated catch and release as a way to ensure sustainability and to avoid overfishing of fish stocks. Lee Wulff, a New York-based fly angler, author and film maker, promoted catch and release as early as 1936 with the phrase &quot;Game fish are too valuable to be caught only once.&quot; Don Martinez a West Yellowstone, Montana, fly shop owner, promoted catch and release in his 1930–40s newsletters sent to Eastern anglers.

In Australia, catch and release caught on slowly, with some pioneers practicing it in the 1960s, and the practice slowly became more widespread in the 1970s and 1980s. Catch and release is now widely used to conserve—and indeed is critical in conserving—vulnerable fish species like the large, long lived native freshwater Murray Cod and the prized, slowly growing, heavily fished Australian bass, heavily fished coastal species like Dusky Flathead and prized gamefish like striped marlin.

In Ireland, catch and release has been used as a conservation tool for Atlantic salmon and sea trout fisheries since 2003. A number of fisheries now have mandatory catch and release regulations. Catch and release for coarse fish has been used by sport anglers for as long as these species have been fished for on this island. However catch and release for Atlantic salmon has required a huge turn about in how many anglers viewed the salmon angling resource. To encourage anglers to practice catch and release in all fisheries a number of government led incentives have been implemented.

In Canada, catch and release is mandatory for some species. Canada also requires in some cases the use of barbless hooks to facilitate release and minimize injury.

In Switzerland and Germany, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and is now banned. In Germany, the &quot;Animal Welfare Act&quot; states that &quot;no-one may cause an animal pain, suffering or harm without good reason&quot;. This leaves no legal basis for catch and release due to its argued inherent lack of &quot;good reason&quot;, and thus personal fishing is solely allowed for immediate food consumption. Additionally, it is against the law to release fish back into the water if they are above minimum size requirements and are not a protected species or in closed season.

In 2011, the National Park Service in Yellowstone National Park began reversing decades of regulation that promoted catch and release and other techniques that protected fish populations. In the name of native fish conservation, they began mandatory kill regulations on rainbow and brook trout in the Lamar River drainage and encouraged unlimited taking and disposal of non-native species, including brown trout in some park waters.

==Techniques==

Into the 21st century, there has been an emphasis on the development and refinement of science-based practices to increase the likelihood that released fish will survive (e.g., see research by Steven J. Cooke). That work led to the development of the UN FAO Technical Guidelines for Recreational Fisheries. 

Effective catch and release fishing techniques avoid excessive fish fighting and handling times by using sufficiently strong tackle and barbless hooks, avoid damage to fish skin, scale and slime layers from nets, dry hands and dry, hot or rough surfaces (that leave fish vulnerable to oomycete skin infections), and avoid damage to jaw ligaments and vertebrae by suspending fish from jaws or gills for weighing or handling. If a net must be used it is important that it is pre-wetted and is not abrasive to the fish (such as a rubber coated net or very dense lightweight mesh), because fish can easily damage themselves in a normal net while thrashing. The use of barbless hooks is an important aspect of catch and release; barbless hooks reduce injury and handling time, increasing survival. Frequently, fish caught on barbless hooks can be released without being removed from the water, and the hook(s) effortlessly slipped out with a single flick of the pliers or leader. Barbless hooks can be purchased from several major manufacturers or can be created from a standard hook by crushing the barb(s) flat with needle-nosed pliers. Some anglers avoid barbless hooks because of the belief that too many fish will escape. Concentrating on keeping the line tight at all times while fighting fish, equipping lures that do not have them with split rings, and using recurved point or &quot;Triple Grip&quot; style hooks on lures, will keep catch rates with barbless hooks as high as those achieved with barbed hooks.

One study looking at brook trout found that barbless hooks had no statistically significant effect on mortality rates when fish were hooked in the mouth, but observed that they did reduce mortalities compared to barbed hooks if fish were hooked deeper. The study also suggested bait fishing does not have a significantly higher mortality when utilized in an active style, rather than a passive manner that allows the fish to swallow the bait.

The effects of catch and release vary from species to species. A study of fish caught in shallow water on the Great Barrier Reef showed high survival rates (97%+), for released fish if handled correctly and particularly if caught on artificial baits such as lures. Fish caught on lures are usually hooked cleanly in the mouth, minimizing injury and aiding release. Other studies have shown somewhat lower survival rates for fish gut-hooked on bait if the line is cut and the fish is released without trying to remove the hook.

==Debate over pain in released fish==
Opponents of catch and release argue that fish are highly evolved vertebrates that share many of the same neurological structures that in humans are associated with pain perception. They cite studies showing that, neurologically, fish are quite similar to higher vertebrates and that blood chemistry reveals that hormones and blood metabolites associated with stress are quite high in fish struggling against hook and line. The idea that fish do not feel pain in their mouths has been studied at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute by injecting bee venom and acetic acid into the lips of rainbow trout; the fish responded by rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks in an effort to relieve themselves of the sensation.

Lead researcher Lynne Sneddon wrote, &quot;Our research demonstrates nociception and suggests that noxious stimulation in the rainbow trout has adverse behavioral and physiological effects. This fulfills the criteria for animal pain.&quot; A 2014 paper provides a critique of existing studies that purport to demonstrate that fish feel pain. James D. Rose of the University of Wyoming argues this may demonstrate a chemical sensitivity rather than pain and that the evidence for pain sensation in fish is ambiguous.

== Injury and mortality in released fish ==
A metastudy in 2005 found that the average catch and release mortality rate was 18%, but varied greatly by species. During an Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation study, up to 43 percent of fish released after being caught died within six days as a result of inadequate holding and weigh in procedures during tournaments. More recent studies reported in Montana estimate that approximately 20% of released trout die from injuries or stress and for those that do not die, their injuries may significantly reduce their ability to feed and grow.

Emerging research suggests catch and release does not work very well with fish caught when deep sea fishing. Most deep sea fish species suffer from the sudden pressure change when wound to the surface from great depths; these species cannot adjust their body&#x27;s physiology quickly enough to follow the pressure change. The result is called &quot;barotrauma&quot;. Fish with barotrauma will have their enormously swollen swim-bladder protruding from their mouth, bulging eyeballs, and often sustain other, more subtle but still very serious injuries. Upon release, fish with barotrauma will be unable to swim or dive due to the swollen swim-bladder. The common practice has been to deflate the swim bladder by pricking it with a thin sharp object before attempting to release the fish. Emerging research also indicates both barotrauma and the practice of deflating the swimbladder are both highly damaging to fish, and that survival rates of caught-and-released deep-sea fish are extremely low. Barotrauma requires that fish be caught at least below the surface. Many surface caught fish, such as billfish, and all fish caught from shore do not meet this criterion and thus do not suffer barotrauma.

== Similar hunting practices ==
A similar practice, called &quot;tree and free&quot;, uses hunting dogs to chase a bear or mountain lion up a tree, and then letting the predator escape. Treeing large predators in such a manner can encourage them to stay away from humans through fear.

<text>The National Science Library (NSL), formerly known as the Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information or CISTI, began in 1917 as the library of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). NRC is the Government of Canada&#x27;s premier research and technology organization (RTO), working with clients and partners to provide innovation support, strategic research, scientific and technical services. The library took on the role of national science library unofficially in 1957 and became the official National Science Library in 1966.

The National Science Library is located in Ottawa, Ontario, and houses one of the world&#x27;s most comprehensive collections of publications in science, technology, engineering and medicine. It is part of NRC&#x27;s Knowledge, Information and Technology Services Branch and provides NRC and Canada&#x27;s research community with information and information services to accelerate discovery, innovation and commercialization.

The NRC Research Press joined the library in 1992. On September 1, 2010, NRC Research Press became a private company called Canadian Science Publishing and is no longer directly affiliated with CISTI or the NRC.

== Partnership initiatives ==
Shared library services – The NSL works with other Government of Canada science-based departments on a number of collaborative initiatives to realize common goals and improve library and knowledge service delivery. The Library currently provides services to four federal departments/agencies, including licensing and acquisitions, cataloguing, reference, library website and document delivery. It also provides all technical library support services to Health Canada as part of a partnership that began in 2010.

Federal Science Library (FSL) – A partnership of seven Government of Canada science departments/agencies implementing a common platform and processes to deliver information discovery and access services to clients. A three-year FSL implementation project was launched in October 2014, with the NSL serving as the project&#x27;s technical lead.

WorldWideScience Alliance – the Library has been a member of this global science search engine since June 2008.

DataCite – NRC&#x27;s National Science Library is a founding member of this worldwide consortium for allocating DOIs to datasets.

== Scientific article discovery and digital infrastructure ==
In December 2013, the NSL implemented a digital repository that holds a number of collections, including the NRC Archives photograph collection of over 12,000 photos dating back to 1916.

In June 2011 the library launched the CISTI Mobile website which provides location and search services to popular mobile devices including Android, Blackberry and iPhone platforms. The mobile website provides federated searching across several science and technology information sources at and beyond the National Science Library. The site was likely the first Canadian federal library mobile website.

In April 2010 the library implemented a federated search system allowing the public to search its local and licensed resources together - including a combined search of NPArC, and the NSL catalogue and the NRC Research Press. NRC researchers are also able to combine searches with these and other publisher sites and databases that the NSL licenses on their behalf.

In June 2009 the library launched the NRC Publications Archive (NPArC), an institutional repository providing a single place to search and discover the scientific publications of the National Research Council. It contains tens of thousands of freely available scientific articles, technical reports, book chapters and other NRC-authored publications.

== Research data discovery and stewardship ==

The National Science Library is a leader and participant in a number of initiatives to support data stewardship and discovery in Canada, including being a founding member of both DataCite and Research Data Canada.

In May 2012, the library launched DataCite Canada, a data registration service that allows Canadian data centres to register research data sets and assign Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).

== Document delivery ==

From the late 1990s until 2010, the library was one of the largest providers of documents in the areas of science technology and medicine in the world.

In 2009 the library announced that document delivery services would be provided in partnership with Infotrieve.

As of June 2010, access to the National Science Library and Canadian Agriculture Library collections is provided by Infotrieve Canada Inc. (a Copyright Clearance Center Company) on behalf of NRC.

Copyright Clearance Center (CCC) handles all aspects of registration, delivery, billing and customer service for all NRC, Canadian, US and international clients wishing to obtain documents and materials in the NRC National Science Library collection. They are also responsible for onsite access to the library collection at NRC&#x27;s main library. To order documents, users must have a CCC account.

<text>Metro Detroit is a major metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Michigan, consisting of the city of Detroit and over 200 municipalities in the surrounding area. There are varied definitions of the area, including the official statistical areas designated by the Office of Management and Budget, a federal agency of the United States.

Metro Detroit is known for its automotive heritage, arts, entertainment, popular music, food, cultural diversity, and sports. The area includes a variety of natural landscapes, parks, and beaches, with a recreational coastline linking the Great Lakes. Metro Detroit also has one of the largest metropolitan economies in the U.S. with 17 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies.

==Definitions==

The Detroit Urban Area, which serves as the metropolitan area&#x27;s core, ranks as the 12th most populous in the United States, with a population of 3,776,890 as of the 2020 census and an area of . This urbanized area covers parts of the counties of Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne. These counties are sometimes referred to as the Detroit Tri-County Area and had a population of 3,862,888 as of the 2010 census with an area of .

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a federal agency of the United States, defines the Detroit–Warren–Dearborn Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as the six counties of Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne. As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 4,296,250 with an area of .

=== Detroit–Warren–Dearborn Metropolitan Statistical Area ===


The nine county area designated by the OMB as the Detroit–Warren–Ann Arbor Combined Statistical Area (CSA) includes the Detroit–Warren–Dearborn MSA and the three additional counties of Genesee, Monroe, and Washtenaw (which include the metropolitan areas of Flint, Monroe, and Ann Arbor, respectively). It had a population of 5,318,744 as of the 2010 census, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, covering an area of . Lenawee County was removed from the CSA in 2000, but added back in 2013.

=== Detroit–Warren–Ann Arbor Combined Statistical Area ===


With the adjacent city of Windsor, Ontario, and its suburbs, the combined Detroit–Windsor area has a population of about 5.7 million. When the nearby Toledo metropolitan area and its commuters are taken into account, the region constitutes a much larger population center. An estimated 46 million people live within a radius of Detroit proper, including the major metropolitan areas of Chicago, Toronto and Cleveland. Metro Detroit is at the center of an emerging Great Lakes Megalopolis.

Conan Smith, a businessperson quoted in a 2012 article by &quot;The Ann Arbor News&quot;, stated the most significant reason Washtenaw County, including Ann Arbor, is not often included in definitions of Metro Detroit is that there is a &quot;lack of affinity that Washtenaw County as a whole has with Wayne County and Detroit or Oakland County and Macomb&quot;. Ann Arbor is nearly 43 miles by car from Downtown Detroit, and developed separately as a university city, with its own character. Smith said that county residents &quot;just don&#x27;t yet see ourselves as a natural part of that [Detroit] region, so I think it feels a little forced to a lot of people, and they&#x27;re scared about it&quot;.


==Economy==

Detroit and the surrounding region constitute a major center of commerce and global trade, most notably as home to America&#x27;s &#x27;Big Three&#x27; automobile companies: General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Detroit&#x27;s six-county Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) has a population of about 4.3 million and a workforce of about 2.1 million. In December 2017, the Department of Labor reported metropolitan Detroit&#x27;s unemployment rate to be 4.2%. The Detroit MSA had a Gross Metropolitan Product (GMP) of $252.7 billion as of September 2017.


Firms in the region pursue emerging technologies including biotechnology, nanotechnology, information technology, and hydrogen fuel cell development.

Metro Detroit is one of the leading health care economies in the U.S., according to a 2003 study measuring health care industry components, with the region&#x27;s hospital sector ranked fourth in the nation.

Casino gaming plays an important economic role, with Detroit the largest US city to offer casino resort hotels. Caesars Windsor, Canada&#x27;s largest, complements the MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, and Hollywood Casino in the city. The casino hotels contribute significant tax revenue along with thousands of jobs for residents. Gaming revenues have grown steadily, with Detroit ranked as the fifth-largest gambling market in the United States for 2007. When Casino Windsor is included, Detroit&#x27;s gambling market ranks either third or fourth.

There are about four thousand factories in the area. The domestic auto industry is primarily headquartered in Metro Detroit. The area is an important source of engineering job opportunities. A rise in automated manufacturing using robotic technology has created related industries in the area.

A 2004 Border Transportation Partnership study showed that 150,000 jobs in the Detroit–Windsor region and $13 billion in annual production depend on the city&#x27;s international border crossing.

In addition to property taxes, residents of the City of Detroit pay an income tax rate of 2.50%.

Detroit automakers and local manufacturers have made significant restructurings in response to market competition. GM made its initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2010, after bankruptcy, bailout, and restructuring by the federal government. Domestic automakers reported significant profits in 2010, interpreted by some analysts as the beginning of an industry rebound and an economic recovery for the Detroit area.

The region&#x27;s nine-county area, with its population of 5.3 million, has a workforce of about 2.6 million and about 247,000 businesses. Fourteen &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies are based in metropolitan Detroit. In April 2015, the metropolitan Detroit unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, a rate lower than the New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta metropolitan areas.

Metro Detroit has made Michigan&#x27;s economy a leader in information technology, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. Michigan ranks fourth nationally in high-tech employment with 568,000 high-tech workers, including 70,000 in the automotive industry.

Michigan typically ranks second or third in overall Research &amp; development (R&amp;D) expenditures in the United States. Metro Detroit is an important source of engineering and high-tech job opportunities. As the home of the &quot;Big Three&quot; American automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler), it is the world&#x27;s traditional automotive center and a key pillar of the U.S. economy. In the 2010s, the domestic auto industry accounts, directly and indirectly, for one of ten jobs in the United States, making it a significant component for economic recovery.

For 2010, the domestic automakers have reported significant profits indicating the beginning of rebound.

Metro Detroit serves as the headquarters for the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (TACOM), with Selfridge Air National Guard Base. Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) is one of America&#x27;s largest and most recently modernized facilities, with six major runways, Boeing 747 maintenance facilities, and an attached Westin Hotel and Conference Center.

Detroit is a major U.S. port with an extensive toll-free expressway system. A 2004 Border Transportation Partnership study showed that 150,000 jobs in the Detroit-Windsor region and $13 billion in annual production depend on Detroit&#x27;s international border crossing. A source of top talent, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is one of the world&#x27;s leading research institutions, and Wayne State University in Detroit has the largest single-campus medical school in the United States.

Metro Detroit is a prominent business center, with major commercial districts such as the Detroit Financial District and Renaissance Center, the Southfield Town Center, and the historic New Center district with the Fisher Building and Cadillac Place. Among the major companies based in the area, aside from the major automotive companies, are BorgWarner (Auburn Hills), Rocket Mortgage (Downtown Detroit), Ally Financial (Downtown Detroit), Carhartt (Dearborn), and Shinola (Detroit).

IBM and Google are among the technology companies with a major presence in Metro Detroit. HP Enterprise Services makes Detroit its regional headquarters, and one of its largest global employment locations. The metropolitan Detroit area has one of the nation&#x27;s largest office markets with 147,082,003 square feet. Chrysler&#x27;s largest corporate facility is its U.S. headquarters and technology center in the Detroit suburb of Auburn Hills, while Ford Motor Company is in Dearborn, directly adjacent to Detroit. In the decade leading up to 2006, downtown Detroit gained more than $15 billion in new investment from private and public sectors.

==Tourism==
Tourism is an important component of the region&#x27;s culture and economy, comprising nine percent of the area&#x27;s two million jobs. About 15.9 million people visit metro Detroit annually, spending about $4.8 billion. Detroit is the largest city or metro area in the U.S. to offer casino resort hotels (MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, Hollywood Casino, and nearby Caesars Windsor).

Metro Detroit is a tourist destination that easily accommodates super-sized crowds to events such as the Woodward Dream Cruise, North American International Auto Show, Youmacon, the Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival, 2009 NCAA Final Four, and Super Bowl XL. The Detroit International Riverfront links the Renaissance Center to a series of venues, parks, restaurants, and hotels. In 2006, the four-day Motown Winter Blast drew a cold weather crowd of about 1.2 million people to Campus Martius Park area downtown.

Detroit&#x27;s metroparks include fresh water beaches, such as Metropolitan Beach, Kensington Beach, and Stony Creek Beach. Metro Detroit offers canoeing through the Huron-Clinton Metroparks. Sports enthusiasts can enjoy downhill and cross-county skiing at Alpine Valley Ski Resort, Mt. Brighton, Mt. Holly, and Pine Knob Ski Resort.

The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is the only international wildlife preserve in North America that is located in the heart of a major metropolitan area. The Refuge includes islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along of the Detroit River and Western Lake Erie shoreline.

Metro Detroit contains a number of shopping malls, including the upscale Somerset Collection in Troy, Great Lakes Crossing Outlets in Auburn Hills, and Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, all of which are draws for tourists.

The region&#x27;s leading attraction is The Henry Ford, located in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn; it is America&#x27;s largest indoor-outdoor museum complex.

The recent renovation of the Renaissance Center, and related construction of a state-of-the-art cruise ship dock, new stadiums, and a new RiverWalk, have stimulated related private economic development. Nearby Windsor has a 19-year-old drinking age with a myriad of entertainment to complement Detroit&#x27;s Greektown district. Some analysts believe that tourism planners have yet to tap the full economic power of the estimated 46 million people who live within a 300-mile (480-km) radius of Detroit.

==Demographics==



Metro Detroit is a six-county metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population of 4,392,041—making it the 14th-largest MSA in the United States as enumerated by the 2020 United States Census.

The Detroit region is a ten-county Combined Statistical Area (CSA) with a population of 5,325,219—making it the 12th-largest CSA in the United States as enumerated by the 2020 Census.

The Detroit–Windsor area, a commercial link straddling the Canada-U.S. border, has a total population of about 5,700,000.

As of the census of 2010, there were 4,296,250 people, 1,682,111 households, and 1,110,454 families residing within the metropolitan statistical area. The census reported 70.1% White, 22.8% African American, 0.3% Native American, 3.3% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 1.2% from other races, and 2.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.2% of the population. Arab Americans were at least 4.7% of the region&#x27;s population (considered white in the US Census).

As of the 2010 American Community Survey estimates, the median income for a household in the MSA was $48,198, and the median income for a family was $62,119. The per capita income for the MSA was $25,403. The region&#x27;s foreign-born population sat at 8.6%. The region contains the largest concentration of Arab-Americans in the United States, particularly in Dearborn. The metro area also has the 25th largest Jewish population worldwide.

In 1701, French officer Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac, along with fifty-one additional French-Canadians, founded a settlement called Fort Ponchartrain du &quot;Détroit&quot;, naming it after the comte de Pontchartrain, Minister of Marine under Louis XIV. The French legacy can be observed today in the names of many area cities (ex. Detroit, Grosse Pointe, Grosse Ile) and streets (ex. Gratiot, Beaubien, St. Antoine, Cadieux). Later came an influx of persons of British and German descent, followed by Polish, Irish, Italian, Lebanese, Assyrian, Greek, Jewish, Maltese, and Belgian immigrants who made their way to the area in the early 20th century and during and after World War II. There was a large migration of African Americans into the city from the rural South during The Great Migration and following World War I.

Today, the Detroit suburbs in Oakland County, Macomb County, and northeastern and northwestern Wayne County are predominantly ethnic European American. Oakland County is among the most affluent counties in the United States, with a population of more than one million. In Wayne County, the city of Dearborn has a large concentration of Arab Americans, mainly Shi&#x27;ite Muslim Lebanese, whose ancestors immigrated here in the early 20th century. Recently, the area has witnessed some growth in ethnic Albanian, Asian and Hispanic populations.

Metro Detroit has a sizeable population of Indian Americans, with an estimated 1.5% of the population being of Indian descent. Indians Americans in Metro Detroit are employed in various engineering and medical fields.

In the 2000s, 115 of the 185 cities and townships in Metro Detroit were more than 95% white. African Americans have also moved to the suburbs: in 2000 44% of the more than 240,000 suburban blacks lived in Inkster, Pontiac, Oak Park, and Southfield.

==Transportation==
===Airports===

The largest airport in the area is Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) in Romulus, an international airport that serves as a commercial hub for Delta Air Lines and Spirit Airlines.

===Transit systems===
Bus service for the metropolitan area is provided jointly by the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) and Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) which operate under a cooperative service and fare agreement. The elevated Detroit People Mover encircles downtown providing service to numerous downtown hotels, offices and attractions. The Woodward Avenue Streetcar has recently began service to provide service between downtown and New Center, and the proposed SEMCOG Commuter Rail would extend from Detroit&#x27;s New Center area to The Henry Ford, Dearborn, Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Ypsilanti, and Ann Arbor The Regional Transit Authority (RTA) was established in December 2012 to coordinate the services of all existing transit providers, and to develop a bus rapid transit service along Woodward Avenue.

===Roads and freeways===


The Metro Detroit area is linked by an advanced network of major roads and freeways which include Interstate highways. Traditionally, Detroiters refer to some of their freeways by name rather than route number. The Davison, Lodge, and Southfield freeways are almost always referred to by name rather than route number. Detroiters commonly precede freeway names with the word &#x27;the&#x27; as in the Lodge, the Southfield, and the Davison. Those without names are referred to by number.

Surface street navigation in Metro Detroit is commonly anchored by &quot;mile roads&quot;, major east–west surface streets that are spaced at one-mile (1.6 km) intervals and increment as one travels north and away from the city center. Mile roads sometimes have two names, the numeric name (ex. 15 Mile Road) used in Macomb County and a local name (ex. Maple Road) used in Oakland County mostly.

<doc id="490916" wikidata="Q2319879" url="?curid=490916" title="Eugenia Smith">
<text>Eugenia Smith (January 25, 1899 – January 31, 1997), also known as Eugenia Drabek Smetisko, was one of several Romanov impostors who claimed to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia, youngest daughter of Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Imperial Russia, and his wife Tsarina Alexandra.
Smith is the author of &quot;Autobiography of HIH Anastasia Nicholaevna of Russia&quot; (1963), in which she recounts &quot;her&quot; life in the Russian Imperial Family up to the time when Bolsheviks murdered them at Ekaterinburg, and &quot;she escaped&quot; the massacre.

Although after World War II there were at least ten claimants to the identity of Grand Duchess Anastasia, only Anna Anderson and Eugenia Smith achieved more than a small circle of believers. The true Anastasia was killed along with her parents and siblings on July 17, 1918, but this was not known with absolute certainty until the missing body of one of the Romanov sisters was found and identified in 2007.

==Birth==

According to naturalization papers she filled out when she emigrated to the United States, Eugenia Smith was born on January 25, 1899, in Bukovina, Austria-Hungary. However, as a claimant to the identity of Grand Duchess Anastasia, she would later assert that she was born on June 18, 1901, in St. Petersburg, Russia. Anastasia&#x27;s date of birth is used on the grave labelled &quot;Evgenia Smetisko&quot; at Holy Trinity Monastery.

==Escape from Russia==

In her published autobiography, Smith provided a lengthy but unverifiable explanation of how she survived the execution of the family of Tsar Nicholas II at Ekaterinburg on July 17, 1918, and subsequently escaped to the west.

By her own account, she regained consciousness in the cellar of the Ipatiev House after the execution, and was rescued by an unidentified woman who moved her to a dugout below a nearby house and then nursed her back to health. Smith began a trek to the west, accompanied by two men, one of whom was later identified to her as Alexander, a soldier who had been stationed at the Ipatiev House. The long journey, undertaken by train and on foot, took Smith and her rescuers through the towns of Ufa, Bugulma, Simbirsk and Kursk before reaching Serbia, where they were accommodated in the home of a local man and his wife. The party later travelled further, arriving at the home of an unidentified Slavic-speaking woman on October 24, 1918. Smith&#x27;s published memoir ended at that point.

==Marriage==
In later interviews, Smith claimed that she married Marijan Smetisko, a Croat, in October 1918; they subsequently had a daughter who died in infancy. She further claimed that her husband had given her permission to travel to the United States in 1922 and that the marriage was dissolved a few years later. In 1963, however, an American journalist tracked down Mr. Smetisko in Yugoslavia and reported: &quot;The man was found living in a poor hut with his wife; he said he&#x27;d never known anybody named Eugenia, or anybody from Chicago, or had ever been married before. He wanted only to be left alone with his cows&quot;.

==Life in the United States==
===Arrival===
A search of passenger manifests confirms that Eugenia Smetisko, aged 22, arrived in New York City on July 27, 1922, travelling from Amsterdam aboard the &quot;S. S. Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;. According to this source, she was a citizen of Yugoslavia, but spoke German and was of German ancestry. She was described as a married woman, with her husband listed as Mr. M. Smetisko of Sisak, Yugoslavia. She further identified her intended final destination as Hamtramck, Michigan. She later settled in Chicago, where she reportedly worked as a salesgirl and a milliner.

Smith evidently returned to Europe later that decade, as another passenger manifest reveals that Eugenia Smetisko, now aged 30, arrived in New York again on September 23, 1929, sailing from Le Havre aboard the &quot;S. S. De Grasse&quot;. This document further indicates that she had applied to become a naturalized citizen of the United States on April 4, 1928, in the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). Her residential address was given as 6263 Greenwood Avenue, Chicago.

===Supporters===
During her early years in Illinois, Smith met John Adams Chapman, a prominent Chicago businessman, who accepted her claim to be the Tsar&#x27;s daughter. Through Chapman&#x27;s connections, Smith befriended two daughters of former federal judge Christian Cecil Kohlsaat, who also became her firm supporters. She would later describe the younger daughter, Mrs. Helen Kohlsaat Wells (1881–1959), as &quot;a close friend and confidant for many, many years&quot;. The two women began to collaborate on Smith&#x27;s memoirs in 1930, and completed a first draft four years later.

During this time, Smith was also a frequent guest of Mrs. Wells&#x27; older sister, Miss Edith Kohlstaat, who still lived in the vast house that her parents had built at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, in the early 1900s. Smith moved there permanently in 1935 but, as Miss Kohlsaat later recalled: &quot;she was difficult to live with, she found fault with all my friends, but she seemed so lost that I wanted to help her&quot;.

It was while staying with Edith Kolhsaat that Smith also met Mrs. Marjorie Wilder Emery, another friend of John Adams Chapman. Mrs. Emery (1882–1967) was the wealthy widow of William Harrison Emery, Jr. (1876–1938), son of William Harrison Emery, Sr. (1840-1903), and a former client of noted Prairie School architect Walter Burley Griffin. In 1945, Smith left Edith Kohlsaat&#x27;s home in Lake Geneva and moved in with Mrs. Emery in Elmhurst. Smith&#x27;s new hostess remained a firm believer in her claim to be the Tsar&#x27;s daughter, and celebrated her birthday each year on Grand Duchess Anastasia&#x27;s actual birthdate of June 18.

Smith remained with Mrs. Emery until 1963, except for two years spent with her daughter, Mrs. Norman Hanson, who lived across the street, and another year in New York when Mrs. Emery was in California. Mrs. Emery later echoed Edith Kohlstaat&#x27;s comments that Smith was difficult to live with, recalling that she often seemed morose, objected to visits by some of Mrs. Emery&#x27;s friends, did not get along with the servant, and became annoyed when she was not permitted to use the family car.

During the time that Smith lived with Mrs. Emery, her story caught the attention of a genuine Romanov relative, Prince Rostislav Alexandrovich Romanov (1902–1978), a nephew of Tsar Nicholas II and therefore first cousin to the real Anastasia. Prince Rostislav, who had lived in Chicago since the 1920s, was informed by his ex-wife, the former Princess Alexandra Pavlovna Galitzine (1905–2006), that Eugenia Smith was living in nearby Elmhurst. Keen to arrange a meeting, the princess invited Smith to lunch on no fewer than three occasions; in each case, however, the claimant declined on the grounds that she was too nervous.

In the late 1950s, Smith was introduced to writer and local historian Edward Arpee (1899–1979), author of such books as &quot;The History of Lake Forrest Academy&quot; (1944) and &quot;From Frigates to Flat-tops&quot; (1953), with whom she planned to collaborate on her memoirs. Arpee later recalled that he prepared a manuscript about the survival of Grand Duchess Anastasia &quot;working from material supplied by Mrs. Smith in odds and ends, and in innumerable interviews&quot;. He later asserted: &quot;She was difficult to get along with; I never received any thanks for my work during those years&quot;. Smith continued to review her manuscript with her long-time champion, Helen Kohlstaat Wells, until the latter&#x27;s death in 1959.

===Other activities===
Whilst living at Lake Geneva, Smith (still using the name Eugenia Smetisko) gained prominence as a lecturer at various women&#x27;s clubs in the Chicago area. In August 1940, she gave a talk to the North Shore Women&#x27;s Club on the subject of the Balkans and Denmark.

In April 1943, at the invitation of the women&#x27;s guild of St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Church in Glencoe, she presented a lecture entitled &quot;Russia Today and Yesterday&quot;. At that time, it was also reported that she had previously spoken at the Chicago Mount Holyoke Club. In 1944, Smith (described as &quot;a Russian artist and traveller&quot;) spoke again on the topic of &quot;Russia Before and Russia Now&quot; before the Niles Center Women&#x27;s Club.

During the time that she lived in Elmhurst with Mrs. Emery, Smith spent two years working in a silver shop on Michigan Avenue. She also attempted to start her own business as a perfume manufacturer, working from Mrs. Emery&#x27;s home, but later became irritated when her hostess refused to invest in the project.

===Publication of memoirs===
Smith&#x27;s public profile as a Romanov claimant was raised following her move to New York City in June 1963. She presented her manuscript to publishers Robert Speller &amp; Sons, initially claiming that she was actually a friend of Grand Duchess Anastasia, who, before her death in 1918, had provided Smith with the notes on which the manuscript was based. Before proceeding any further, the Spellers contacted Gleb Botkin, son of the Tsar&#x27;s physician and a childhood friend of the genuine Grand Duchess Anastasia. Botkin, who was a fervent supporter of rival Anastasia claimant Anna Anderson, was skeptical of Smith&#x27;s claim.

Speller &amp; Sons subsequently requested that Smith undergo a lie detector test. Under claims that she was Anastasia&#x27;s close childhood friend, Smith failed the test, but after claiming that she actually was the late Princess, polygraph expert and former CIA agent Cleve Backster, concluded after nearly 30 hours of testing that he was &quot;virtually positive that his subject was Anastasia&quot;. Gleb Botkin remained unconvinced; he later stated that &quot;the lie detector must have had a screw loose somewhere&quot;, and warned Speller &amp; Sons not to proceed with the project.

Nevertheless, the publishers went ahead. Smith&#x27;s manuscript was re-written as the memoirs of Grand Duchess Anastasia herself, and was published towards the end of 1963 under the title &quot;Anastasia: The Autobiography of H.I.H. The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaevna of Russia&quot;. Prior to publication, excerpts were printed by &quot;Life&quot; magazine, along with articles detailing the mixed results of the lie detector tests, handwriting analysis and an anthropologist&#x27;s comparison of Smith&#x27;s facial features with photographs of the actual Grand Duchess. There were also comments from two people who had known the Grand Duchess in childhood: Princess Nina Chavchavadze and Gleb Botkin&#x27;s sister, Tatiana Melnik, both of whom rejected Smith&#x27;s claims. Like her brother, Tatiana Melnik was convinced that rival claimant Anna Anderson was the genuine article. Anderson was aware of Smith&#x27;s claims and discussed them with journalist Alexis Milukoff in a series of taped interviews conducted in Germany in the mid-1960s. Of the story, Anderson simply quipped: &quot;Is it not incredible?&quot;.

In December 1963, Speller &amp; Sons were contacted by Michael Goleniewski, a former Polish army officer who, for some years, had claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia&#x27;s brother, the Tsarevich Alexei. A meeting was arranged between the two claimants, which took place at the publisher&#x27;s New York offices on December 31, 1963. As recorded by Anna Anderson&#x27;s biographer, the late James Blair Lovell, &quot;the two imposters tearfully embraced and affirmed one another&#x27;s authenticity&quot;. Although they later planned to collaborate on a memoir, the alleged siblings subsequently had a falling out. In 1965, Smith denounced Goleniewski as a fraud, although he reportedly remained convinced that she was his sister. 

===Later life and death===
Michael Goloniewski later claimed that his &quot;sister&quot; had died in New York City in 1968, reputedly murdered after a visit of &quot;very powerful men... two of them were Rockefellers&quot;. This, however, was not correct, as Smith was still alive and well at that time. She moved to Newport, Rhode Island, in the early 1970s, where she attended the local Congregational Church until her death.

During that time, she founded the St Nicholas House Foundation, a non-profit organization to establish a museum for Russian art and history in the United States. In her later years, Smith distanced herself from earlier claims of Imperial origins. In 1984, Associated Press reported that she had refused to discuss her claims with them. A decade later, when she was asked if she would like to provide a blood sample for DNA analysis, she also refused.

Smith painted into her 90s. Johannes Froebel-Parker published samples of her artwork in &quot;The Art of the Authoress of Anastasia: The Autobiography of H.I.H. The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaevna of Russia&quot; (2014: Authorhouse); .

==Death==
Eugenia Smith died on January 31, 1997, at the Lafayette Nursing Home in North Kingstown, at the purported age of 95 years. Rev. Lark d&#x27;Helen, who conducted her memorial service at the Newport Congregational Church, said of her: &quot;Eugenia was a woman of character determined, tenacious, imperial even to the end&quot;. Of her claim to be the grand Duchess Anastasia, another long-time friend stated: &quot;She is an enigma ... that&#x27;s not really important if she is or if she isn&#x27;t. To me, she&#x27;s just a human being. That&#x27;s how everyone knew her&quot;.

Many newspapers published her obituary using Anastasia&#x27;s birth date, or stated that she had been born in St. Petersburg. Unlike Anna Anderson, who was cremated upon death, Eugenia Smith was interred in the Orthodox fashion in the cemetery of Holy Trinity Orthodox Monastery in Jordanville, New York, as cremation is prohibited in that faith. She is buried in the back right side of the newer section of the cemetery under the name Evgenia Smetisko.

<doc id="490918" wikidata="Q333505" url="?curid=490918" title="Sam Kinison">
<text>Samuel Burl Kinison ( ; December 8, 1953 – April 10, 1992) was an American stand-up comedian and actor. A former Pentecostal preacher, he performed stand-up routines that were characterized by intense sudden tirades, punctuated with his distinctive scream, similar to charismatic preachers. Initially performing for free, Kinison became a regular fixture at The Comedy Store, where he met and eventually befriended such comics as Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. Kinison&#x27;s comedy was crass observational humor, especially towards women and dating, and his popularity grew quickly, leading to appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. At the peak of his career in early 1992, he was killed in a car crash, aged 38. 

Kinison received a Grammy nomination in 1988 for the single &quot;Wild Thing&quot; from his &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately?&quot; album, and a posthumous win in 1994 for Best Spoken Comedy Album, &quot;Live from Hell&quot;.

==Early life==
Samuel Burl Kinison was born in Yakima, Washington, on December 8, 1953, the son of Marie Florence (&quot;née&quot; Morrow) and Samuel Earl Kinison, a Pentecostal preacher. The family moved to East Peoria, Illinois, when Kinison was three months old. At the age of three years, Kinison was hit by a truck, which left him with brain damage and epilepsy. His father pastored several churches around the country, receiving little income. Kinison had two older brothers, Richard and Bill, and a younger brother, Kevin. His parents divorced when Kinison was 11 after which his brother Bill went to live with his father while Kinison stayed with the rest of the family, despite his protests. Bill described this as the root of much of Sam&#x27;s anger. Kinison later attended East Peoria Community High School in East Peoria.

Kinison and his brothers emulated their father by becoming Pentecostal preachers. Between 1968 and 1969, Kinison attended Pinecrest Bible Training Center, an interdenominational, unaccredited, three-year bible school located in Salisbury Center, New York. His mother married another preacher and moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Kinison lived for a while. He preached from the age of 17 to 24 and recordings of his sermons reveal that he used a &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; style, punctuated with shouts similar to the ones he would later use in his stand-up routines. His brother Bill, however, noted that &quot;ironically, he had no stage presence&quot; and he was not very successful at making money from preaching, as he was more concerned with making the sermons more informative than entertaining. After Kinison and his first wife were divorced, he abandoned preaching and took up comedy.

==Career==
Kinison began his career in Houston, Texas, where he performed in small clubs. He became a member of a comedic group at the Comedy Workshop, known as the Texas Outlaw Comics, that included Bill Hicks, Ron Shock, Riley Barber, Steve Epstein, Andy Huggins, John Farneti, and Jimmy Pineapple. Hicks cited Kinison as a major influence on his comedic style, noting that &quot;He was the first guy I ever saw to go on stage and not in any way ask the audience to like him.&quot; In 1980, Kinison moved to Los Angeles hoping to find work at The Comedy Store, but was first employed as a doorman. He soon developed a cocaine and alcohol addiction, quickly progressing to freebasing cocaine, and struggled to gain a foothold in the business until his brother Bill moved to Los Angeles to help manage his career.

His big break came on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s Ninth Annual Young Comedians Special&quot; in August 1985. After noting the performance of Bob Nelson, reviewer Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;the most interesting of the other eight comedians is the savagely funny Sam Kinison. Mr. Kinison specializes in a grotesque animalist howl that might be described as the primal scream of the married man.&quot; Kinison would later appear in Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s film &quot;Back to School&quot; in 1986.

In Kinison&#x27;s debut television appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in 1985, Letterman&#x27;s introduction of Kinison warned his audience, &quot;Brace yourselves. I&#x27;m not kidding. Please welcome Sam Kinison.&quot; Kinison played on his former role as a Bible-preaching evangelist, taking satirical and sacrilegious shots at the Bible, Christianity and famous Christian evangelist scandals of his day. Kinison&#x27;s daring comedy helped shoot him to stardom. On several videos of his stand-up routines, a shot of the personalized license plate on his 1986 Corvette reveals the words &quot;EX REV&quot;. He was associated with the Los Angeles rock music scene and was occasionally accompanied by a touring band.

Howard Stern purchased the film rights to Kinison&#x27;s biography, written by Kinison&#x27;s brother, at one point (2008) reporting that HBO would make &quot;Brother Sam&quot; with Kinison being played by Dan Fogler. In an interview with Sam&#x27;s brother and manager Bill Kinison, Bill mentioned film deals that were in development at the time of his death; one such deal was a film with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and another with Rick Moranis.

==Personal life==
In May 1988, his youngest brother, Kevin, shot himself at the age of 28, which devastated Sam.

Kinison acquired much of his material from his first two marriages, to Patricia Adkins (1975–1980) and Terry Marze (1981–1989). He began a relationship with dancer Malika Souiri toward the end of his marriage with Marze.&lt;ref name=&quot;alamy/412239677&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lasvegasweekly/Kinison-Oral-History&quot;&gt;
*&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Souiri alleged she was raped by a man Kinison had hired as a bodyguard while Kinison was asleep in the house. The bodyguard stated that the sex was consensual; the jury deadlocked in the subsequent trial, and the charges were later dropped. The incident inspired Kinison to try to go straight with Souiri and join an Alcoholics Anonymous chapter; by March 1990 he was saying to audiences that he was no longer getting high.

Kinison frequented rock shows and often hung out with musicians. In May 1991, Kinison got in a fight with guitarist Slash at a hotel after Slash missed a planned appearance at one of Kinison&#x27;s shows. Slash stated that Kinison nearly &quot;choked [him] to death&quot; before Slash&#x27;s bandmate Duff McKagan intervened. Slash and McKagan declined to press charges after the incident.

On April 4, 1992, six days before his death, Kinison married Souiri at the Candlelight Chapel in Las Vegas. They honeymooned in Hawaii for five days before returning home to Los Angeles on April 10 to prepare for a show that night at the Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada.

Souiri sued Kinison&#x27;s brother, Bill, in 1995 for allegedly defaming her in his book &quot;Brother Sam: The Short Spectacular Life of Sam Kinison&quot;. Souiri sued Bill Kinison a second time in 2009, alleging he forged Sam&#x27;s will but claiming she did not discover the fact until 2007.

In February 2011, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; reported that Kinison had fathered a child with the wife of his best friend and opening act, Carl LaBove, who had been paying child support for the girl for nearly 13 years. LaBove filed legal papers claiming the girl was Kinison&#x27;s and DNA tests taken from Kinison&#x27;s brother Bill show a 99.8% likelihood that Kinison was the father of the unnamed woman.

==Death==
On April 10, 1992, Kinison was driving his Pontiac Turbo Trans Am when it was struck head-on on Needles Highway northwest of Needles, California by a pickup truck driven by a juvenile named Troy Pierson. Prior to the crash, Pierson had been drinking alcohol. The pickup truck crossed the center line of the roadway while trying to pass another vehicle and moved into Kinison&#x27;s lane. Kinison and his wife were on their way to Laughlin, Nevada, to perform at a sold-out show at the Riverside Casino.

After the crash, Kinison appeared stable, with only minor visible facial wounds. He got out of his vehicle and sat down on the side of the road, where he soon died from internal injuries. His head had smashed the windshield, because he was not wearing his seat belt. He was 38 years old. His wife received a concussion in the collision but later recovered after being taken directly to a hospital in Needles for treatment. Kinison&#x27;s last words were reportedly stated to no one in particular at the crash scene as &quot;why now?&quot;, then after a pause he asked &quot;but why?&quot;, and after another pause, said &quot;okay, okay, okay&quot;. A friend who was with him at the time later recalled, &quot;Whatever voice was talking to him gave him the right answer and he just relaxed with it&quot;.

An autopsy found that Kinison sustained multiple traumatic injuries, including a dislocation in the cervical spine, a torn aorta, and torn blood vessels in his abdominal cavity, which resulted in his death within a few minutes of the crash. 

Pierson pleaded guilty to one count of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence. He was sentenced to one year of probation and 300 hours of community service. Pierson also had his driver&#x27;s license suspended for two years in connection with the collision. 

On April 15, 1992, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Burbank, California, a funeral service was held.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/kinisons-service&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kinison&#x27;s body was buried in a family grave plot at Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His gravestone is inscribed, &quot;In another time and place he would have been called prophet&quot;.

==Legacy==
Comedian George Carlin&#x27;s eighth HBO stand-up comedy special, &quot;Jammin&#x27; in New York&quot;, was dedicated to Kinison&#x27;s memory. At the beginning of the broadcast, the words: &quot;This show is for SAM&quot; appeared on the screen.

After his death, Kinison was fondly remembered by his friends and costars. Ozzy Osbourne said: 

On May 23, 1993, FOX aired a special, &quot;A Tribute to Sam Kinison&quot;. The special contained archival footage of Kinison and stand-up comedy performances by comedians including Robin Williams, Rodney Dangerfield, and Jim Carrey.

Between 2008 and 2013, there were some press releases regarding a possible dramatic film to be based on the memoir &quot;Brother Sam: The Short, Spectacular Life of Sam Kinison&quot;, by Kinison&#x27;s brother Bill Kinison and Steve Delsohn.

Kinison&#x27;s comedy was at times accused of containing misogyny and homophobia, according to a retrospective on Kinison&#x27;s career in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. For example, the group Queer Nation Nebraska demonstrated on a sidewalk in front of a Kinison show in Lincoln in February 1991, chanting &quot;Anti-woman, anti-gay, Sam Kinison go away!&quot;
His &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately?&quot; album carried a disclaimer sticker stating &quot;The Material On This Album Does Not Reflect The Views Or Opinions Of Warner Bros. Records.&quot; Employees at Warner Brothers requested that their bosses not release it due to the controversial material on Kinison&#x27;s first album.
In a 2016 article by John Hugar in &quot;New York&quot;, Hugar contended that the comedy of past comedians, including Kinison, was not positively embraced by younger generations, perhaps because their material has come to be viewed as anachronistically sexist and misogynistic with time. Hugar noted that a modern reevaluation was complicated by the possibility that Kinison could be considered as playing an intentionally shocking character rather than speaking as himself.

<doc id="490927" wikidata="Q1254455" url="?curid=490927" title="Joe Gibbs">
<text>Joseph Jackson Gibbs (born November 25, 1940) is an American auto racing team owner and former football coach. He served as the head coach of the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) from 1981 to 1992 and then 2004 to 2007, leading them to nine playoff appearances, five NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowl wins over 16 seasons.

Gibbs was named the 1982 and 1983 NFL Coach of the Year and is the only head coach to have won Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks. He and his sons founded the NASCAR team Joe Gibbs Racing in 1992, which has since won five NASCAR championships. Gibbs, named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, is also the only member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and NASCAR Hall of Fame.

== Early life and college ==
Born in Mocksville, North Carolina, Gibbs is the older of two sons of Jackson Cephus Gibbs (1916–1989) and Winnie Era Blalock (1915–2000). He graduated from Santa Fe High School in 1959, where he played quarterback. Gibbs attended Cerritos College before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1966 from San Diego State University.

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
Gibbs began his career in 1964 coaching offensive linemen under Don Coryell for the San Diego State Aztecs football team. He served two years each at Florida State, USC, and Arkansas. Gibbs then advanced to the National Football League, hired as the offensive backfield coach for the St. Louis Cardinals (1973–1977) by Coryell, who had been named head coach. After a season as offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1978) under former USC coach John McKay, Gibbs rejoined Coryell with the San Diego Chargers in 1979.

===Advocating for black quarterbacks in the NFL===
While in Tampa, Gibbs developed the reputation as a leading pioneer for championing black quarterbacks in the NFL, which was considered extremely controversial at the time. After thoroughly studying Matt Cavanaugh, who led Pitt to a national championship, Guy Benjamin, an All-American from Stanford University, and Doug Williams from Grambling State University, Gibbs rated Williams as the best professional prospect, and informed head coach McKay that Williams would be &quot;hands down and without question&quot; the best quarterback in the 1978 NFL draft. According to Tony Dungy, &quot;People don&#x27;t realize that Joe Gibbs changed the face of the NFL by having the courage to say, in a Southern town at that time, that Doug Williams is the guy we should take. When Tampa drafted Doug, it shocked the whole country to take this unknown from Grambling over those star players from Pitt and Stanford. But that was Joe Gibbs. He was looking for the best player possible.&quot; With the recommendation of Gibbs, Tampa Bay selected Williams, and became the first African-American drafted in the first round to play quarterback.

In his book &quot;Rise of the Black QB&quot;, author Jason Reid cited an incident in the 1978 Tampa Bay training camp, in which quarterbacks coach Bill Nelsen began berating Williams in what was described as going beyond coaching and becoming a personal attack. Just a position coach at the time, Gibbs, who was at the opposite end of the field, sprinted over to Nelsen and confronted him. &quot;I think Coach Gibbs knew that it wasn&#x27;t a matter of being coached hard,&quot; recalled Williams. &quot;I mean, I played for Eddie Robinson at Grambling, so he &quot;knew&quot; I could handle that. But he (Gibbs) immediately sensed that something else was going on.&quot; Gibbs threw his clipboard down, pointed his finger in Nelsen&#x27;s face and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever talk to him like that again! Is that clear?&quot; According to Williams, Nelsen never confronted Williams in that manner again.

===The Architect of Air Coryell===
As the offensive coordinator for San Diego, Gibbs spearheaded the highly successful &quot;Air Coryell&quot; offense. Using a sophisticated passing attack, the Chargers and quarterback Dan Fouts set multiple offensive records during Gibbs&#x27; two seasons there. Remarkably, the Chargers averaged more than 400 yards of offense per game during their 1980 season. After 17 years of coaching as an assistant, the Washington Redskins offered Gibbs their head coaching position.

===Washington Redskins (1981–1992)===
After firing then-head coach Jack Pardee, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke was on the lookout for candidates. When general manager Bobby Beathard pointed out the 40-year-old San Diego assistant coach, Cooke, who had a keen eye for spotting leadership and an ability to teach (he also hired Jerry West and Sparky Anderson to their first managerial/executive jobs), saw Gibbs&#x27; potential during an interview and hired him.

Gibbs&#x27; first season with the Redskins started inauspiciously when the team lost their first five games. Cooke famously expressed confidence in Gibbs, declaring that the team would finish 8–8. The losses and Cooke&#x27;s confidence served as a catalyst, and the newly motivated team improved and reached an even 8–8 record in 1981.

Gibbs&#x27; second season with the Redskins, which was shortened by a players strike, saw them defeat the Miami Dolphins 27–17 in Super Bowl XVII. In 1983, Gibbs&#x27; success continued with a 14–2 regular-season record and a win against the Los Angeles Rams 51–7 at home, in the divisional round of the playoffs. The Redskins once again won an NFC Championship, defeating the San Francisco 49ers 24–21 on a last-second field goal, advancing to Super Bowl XVIII. The Redskins were installed as a 2-point favorite by Nevada books going into the game, but were soundly defeated by the Los Angeles Raiders 38–9.

The 1984 Redskins won the NFC East with an 11–5 record and hosted a home playoff game against the Chicago Bears but lost 23–19.
Gibbs coached the 1985 Redskins to a 10–6 regular-season record and barely missed the playoffs. During the season Joe Theismann broke his leg during a Monday Night Football game against the New York Giants, but the Redskins still won the game with Jay Schroeder at quarterback.

In 1986, Gibbs coached the team to a 12–4 regular-season record and defeated the Los Angeles Rams 19–7 in the wild card playoffs, then upset the defending champion Chicago Bears 27–13 in the divisional round, on the road, to get back to the NFC Championship game against the New York Giants. The Giants would win 17–0. It was to be Gibbs&#x27; only NFC championship game loss.

The 1987 Redskins made the playoffs and again defeated the Chicago Bears 21–17 on the road in the divisional round, then beat the Minnesota Vikings 17–10 at home in the NFC Championship Game, then at Super Bowl XXII, they rode the arm of quarterback Doug Williams to blow out the Denver Broncos 42–10.

Four years later, the Redskins won their first 11 games before finishing the season 14–2, and cruised through the playoffs with home victories over the Atlanta Falcons (24–7) and Detroit Lions (41–10). In Super Bowl XXVI, the Redskins were up 24–0 on the Buffalo Bills just 16 seconds into the third quarter, and 37–10 with over 11 minutes to go when Gibbs pulled most of his starters. The Bills would score two cosmetic touchdowns for a final score of 37–24. The victory gave Gibbs and the team their third Super Bowl title.

Gibbs returned for the 1992 regular season to defend the Redskins&#x27; Super Bowl crown from the previous year. The Redskins finished with a lesser record at 9–7 and third place in the NFC East. They needed a bit of help to make the playoffs and they got it after a loss by the Green Bay Packers got them in as the last Wild Card entry. In the wild-card round, the Redskins defeated the Minnesota Vikings on the road, by the score of 24–7, however they would fall in the divisional round to the San Francisco 49ers in a road game by the score of 20–13, ending the Redskins&#x27; hopes of retaining their Super Bowl crown. Two months after Super Bowl XXVII, Gibbs retired on March 5, 1993, surprising many in the organization and around the league. Center Jeff Bostic called it &quot;probably the biggest shock I&#x27;ve gotten in my life.&quot; A notorious workaholic, he had begun to suffer health problems, and he cited a desire to spend more time with his family.

From 1994 to 1997, Gibbs served as a color analyst on NBC Sports&#x27; NFL pregame show.

In 1996, Gibbs was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was one of the winningest coaches in the NFL, with a record of 124–60, and a post-season record of 16–5. His combined winning percentage of .683 was third all-time (behind Vince Lombardi and John Madden). In his 12 seasons so far, the Redskins won 4 NFC East titles, reached the playoffs 8 times, and finished with a losing record only one season (7–9 in 1988). Gibbs is the only NFL coach to win three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks and three different starting running backs.

===Second stint with Redskins (2004–2007)===

Throughout his retirement, many NFL owners approached Gibbs hoping to lure him out of retirement, but to no avail. Some owners even offered to move his entire NASCAR racing team to their team&#x27;s city if he came back. The only team he seriously considered coming back for was the Carolina Panthers when they first joined the NFL as an expansion in 1995. However, he did not believe he would be able to manage his time between his race team and coaching. In 1999, he was part of a group that was trying to buy the Redskins but ultimately failed. In 2002, Gibbs and a small group of investors bought five percent of the Atlanta Falcons from owner Arthur Blank for $27 million. It wasn&#x27;t until late 2003 when Gibbs took a serious interest in returning to football. Blank and his general manager, Rich McKay moved quickly to interview him for the Falcons&#x27; vacant head coaching position due to the firing of Dan Reeves.

In January 2004, Gibbs accepted an offer from Redskins owner Daniel Snyder to return as the team&#x27;s head coach. At his press conference, Gibbs stated that even though he enjoyed NASCAR, he had also missed coaching in the NFL. Gibbs left his racing team in the hands of his eldest son, J. D., while his other son, Coy, joined him as an assistant with the Redskins. Many coaches from his previous tenure with the team returned with Gibbs as well, including offensive line coach/assistant head coach Joe Bugel, offensive coordinator Don Breaux, quarterbacks coach Jack Burns, and tight ends coach Rennie Simmons. Gibbs also hired former Buffalo Bills head coach Gregg Williams to join the team to run the defense and hired one of his former running backs, Earnest Byner, to serve as running backs coach.

In 2004, Gibbs had what was, up to that point, the worst season of his career with a 6–10 finish. However, the team did finish the season on a high note with a 21–18 victory over playoff-bound Minnesota. The defense also finished the season ranked third in yards allowed. Hoping to improve on the previous season&#x27;s dismal passing attack, Gibbs added former Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave as his quarterbacks coach. Having coached new Redskins quarterback Mark Brunell when they both were in Jacksonville, they easily formed a rapport. Musgrave&#x27;s input allowed the Redskins to add a few new wrinkles to their playbook. For the first time under Gibbs, the Redskins offense utilized the shotgun formation. In the Wild Card playoff game, Gibbs led his team to a 17–10 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, to whom the Redskins suffered a 36–35 defeat earlier in the year. In the next round of the playoffs, however, the Redskins could not replicate their early-season victory over the Super Bowl-bound Seattle Seahawks, and lost to the eventual NFC Champion by the score of 20–10.
During the 2006 offseason, Gibbs hired Kansas City Chiefs&#x27; offensive coordinator Al Saunders to be associate head coach. Saunders came from a similar background as Gibbs, as both learned under Don Coryell. He took over for Gibbs as the team&#x27;s primary play-caller upon joining the Redskins. This allowed Gibbs to focus more on his role as head coach and CEO and devote more time to personnel matters, defense, and special teams. Gibbs also added former Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator Jerry Gray to his staff as secondary/cornerbacks coach.

The Redskins finished 5–11 in 2006, the team&#x27;s worst regular-season record under him. The following season the team suffered a tragedy when free safety Sean Taylor was shot in his home during a home robbery in November 2007 and died in the hospital a day later. However, the Redskins still qualified for the playoffs following the completion of a 9–7 regular season before being defeated by the NFC West division champions Seattle Seahawks in the first round. Gibbs retired as head coach and president in January 2008, citing family obligations. During Gibbs&#x27; four-year return to the Redskins, the team qualified for the playoffs twice, once more than it qualified for the playoffs during his 11-year absence. He was succeeded as head coach by Jim Zorn.

===Style of play===
Although Gibbs helped craft a passing-oriented attack during his time in San Diego, his Redskins teams incorporated a smash-mouth, rushing-oriented attack oriented around such plays as the iconic counter trey. By building a strong offensive line (known as &quot;The Hogs&quot;) Gibbs was able to control the line of scrimmage, allowing workhorse running backs John Riggins, George Rogers, and Earnest Byner to power the ground game. Gibbs added a deep passing attack which complemented the ground game, utilizing agile receivers such as Art Monk, Gary Clark, and Ricky Sanders. Gibbs&#x27; offense was aided by aggressive defensive units under the direction of defensive coordinator Richie Petitbon.

Gibbs&#x27; system was robust enough to be successful without a Hall-of-Fame-caliber quarterback at the helm. The Redskins&#x27; Super Bowl victories were won featuring Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, and Mark Rypien. Gibbs is credited with inventing the H-back set, typically by use of a smaller tight end in the backfield. Gibbs was also credited for creating the Trips formation: stacking three wide receivers to one side. He is one of few coaches that utilized the H-back position prominently in his offense. Gibbs&#x27; offenses were known for their extensive number of formations, as well as shifts and motions.

==Joe Gibbs Racing (1992–present)==
Gibbs created his NASCAR team, Joe Gibbs Racing in 1992, a year before he first retired from the NFL. The first driver for his team was Dale Jarrett (1992–1994), with the sponsor Interstate Batteries, and the number 18. His son, J. D. Gibbs, was the president of Joe Gibbs Racing and oversaw daily operations of each of the teams since his father&#x27;s return to the NFL. J. D. Gibbs died on January 11, 2019. Driver Denny Hamlin won the Daytona 500 on February 17 and dedicated the win to J. D. in his post-race celebration.

The team currently fields four full-time entries in the NASCAR Cup Series and three full-time entries in the NASCAR Xfinity Series.

===NHRA===
Beginning in 1995, Gibbs fielded three cars in the NHRA, one, in each of these professional categories:
* the Funny Car, driven by Cruz Pedregon
* the Top Fuel dragster, driven by Cory McClenathan
* the Pro Stock Firebird, driven by Jim Yates
Yates would bring home 2 NHRA Winston Pro Stock Championships in 1996 and 1997. McDonald&#x27;s was the primary sponsor on all three cars from 1995 to 1997. In 1998 Cruz Pedregon would be sponsored by Interstate Batteries and Jim Yates by SplitFire.

Pedregon won Gibbs&#x27; first NHRA National Event as a team owner at the 1995 NHRA Chief Auto Parts Winternationals. He would couple that with a victory at the &#x27;95 NHRA U.S. Nationals, third for Pedregon in four years at the U.S. Nationals. Pedregon continued to race for Gibbs until mid-season (Englishtown, New Jersey) in 1999. Ending with a final-round appearance, Pedregon left to race on his own, and was replaced by Tommy Johnson Jr. would win his first Fuel Funny Car win with Gibbs at the &#x27;99 NHRA Keystone Nationals and would go to the next two final rounds, scoring another victory in the process. It was announced that after the &#x27;99 season, Gibbs team would be reduced to a two-car team, and the Funny Car team was parked from then on.

McClenathan finished second in NHRA Winston Top Fuel points in both 1997 and 1998 with Gibbs. In 1997, McClenathan went on a hot streak, sweeping the famed Western Swing (Denver, Sonoma, Seattle) and a total four wins in a row, 5 in 6 races since Denver, including a final round at the U.S. Nationals in &#x27;97. He also took Gibbs&#x27; MBNA Top Fuel Dragster to a $200,000 payday, winning the 2000 NHRA Winston No-Bull Showdown, pitting Top Fuel Dragsters against Funny Cars in a 24 car shootout.

Gibbs announced that he would focus solely on his NASCAR teams following the 2000 season, ending the six-year-long relationship with NHRA.

===Motocross===
In 2008, Gibbs branched out into motorcycle racing, forming the JGRMX team competing in the AMA motocross and supercross championships. The team is based in Huntersville, North Carolina. The team was managed by Gibbs&#x27; son Coy Gibbs until his untimely death in November 2022.

== Game Plan for Life ==
He founded Game Plan for Life in 2009, an evangelical Christian witnessing organization. In 2017, the organization funded the establishment of a Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary campus in the Nash Correctional Institution prison in Nashville, North Carolina.

==Personal life==
Gibbs became a Baptist at the age of nine. He currently resides in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife Patricia, who is of Mexican descent. They had two sons, J. D. Gibbs and Coy Gibbs, and eight grandchildren, including Ty Gibbs. His son J. D. died on January 11, 2019, after a long battle with neurological brain disease diagnosed in 2015, while his other son, Coy, died in his sleep on November 6, 2022. His grandsons Jackson and Ty both work for his team. Jackson played college football at UCLA and Appalachian State, and Miller also played football at Appalachian State. Jackson is currently a pit crew member for Christopher Bell in the NASCAR Cup Series. Ty drives the No. 54 in the NASCAR Cup Series for JGR. Ty won the 2021 ARCA Menards Series championship and the 2022 NASCAR Xfinity Series championship. Gibbs became a limited partner of Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment (HBSE) upon their investment in Joe Gibbs Racing in 2023.

===Politics===
On September 5, 2008, Gibbs addressed the 2008 Republican National Convention, during which he offered his support for John McCain and his hope that the McCain-Palin ticket would lead to a &#x27;spiritual awakening&#x27; in the United States. Gibbs has long been open about his Christian faith, but notoriously reserved about articulating his political positions, because, as the old Washington joke goes, &quot;The Redskins are the only thing that unites the town.&quot; As one of the most sought after A-List figures in Washington social circles for over a quarter-century (and even being referred to as &quot;the most popular man in Washington&quot; by the &quot;Washington Post&quot;), Gibbs admitted being uneasy addressing the convention, stating that it was &quot;a little awkward to put on a partisan hat.&quot;

==Writing career==
In 1992, Gibbs co-authored &quot;Joe Gibbs: Fourth and One&quot;, and in 2003, he co-authored &quot;Racing to Win&quot;. The books resemble a business and life how-to book and motivational guide as he discusses his successes and mistakes in his career, offering the lessons he learned as tips to the readers. In 2009, Gibbs wrote the book &quot;Game Plan for Life&quot; which discusses his life in football; how his religious faith can help others and outside of sports, as well as key topics that are important to people trying to lead a contemporary Christian lifestyle.

<text>Jordanville is a hamlet in the town of Warren, Herkimer County, New York, United States. Jordanville is in the northwestern part of Warren, at the intersection of New York State Route 167 and County Route 155. The community was settled by European Americans after the Revolutionary War and before 1791. Its name was derived from the nearby Ocquionis Creek, which was used by settlers for baptisms and likened by them to the Jordan River.

==History==
The hamlet was once served by the Southern New York Railroad, an electric trolley line that ran from Oneonta to Mohawk.

==Gelston Castle==
This castle was built in 1836 by Harriet Douglas Cruger, with stone sourced from Little Falls, New York. She had been inspired as a young woman by seeing Gelston Castle, owned by her uncle in Scotland, which she visited. Harriet Douglas was described as an independent and eccentric woman, who had her marriage bed sawed in half and used as two couches after an acrimonious divorce. She was profiled in &quot;Miss Douglas of New York&quot;, a book written by Angus Davidson in 1953.

The property passed to her niece Fanny (Monroe) Robinson, daughter of Harriet&#x27;s sister Elizabeth Mary (Douglas) and her husband James Monroe, nephew of President James Monroe. Fanny Robinson left the castle to her son Douglas Robinson. He married Corrine Roosevelt, the sister of President Theodore Roosevelt. Their eldest son, Theodore Douglas Robinson, married Helen Roosevelt, a half-niece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Helen Roosevelt Robinson was the last family member to live in the house, passing away on July 8, 1962.

After Helen Roosevelt Robinson died, her grandson, Douglas Robinson Jr., sold the property to Jan Blair of New Jersey, who operated a retirement home on the premises. She sold the property to the Asian Conservation Laboratory in 1974. This organization subsequently sold the property to Frances Kudla, who operated a retirement home there.

Mrs. Kudla sold the property in 1979 to Mstislav Rostropovich, the Russian cellist who became musical director and conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, DC. In 1983 he and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, constructed a million dollar contemporary residence on the sprawling estate grounds, yards from the castle.

Largely unoccupied for most of the second half of the 20th century, the castle fell into a state of complete disrepair, with almost all of the structure now collapsed much like its namesake in Scotland. After Rostropovich left the United States to return to his homeland of Russia in the late 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, the whole estate was marketed as Gelston Manor during 2000–2007. Rostropovich&#x27;s mansion and associated property was sold separately in 2006–2007. Since then, the castle has been a subject of tours on occasions organized by the Herkimer County Historical Society. That organization has held an annual &quot;Weekend at Gelston Castle&quot;. 

In 2007, Gelston Castle was purchased along with the Rostropovich Mansion and by the Safflyn Corporation. This environmental development corporation works with companies and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint, integrate renewable energy sources, promote environmentally safe products, and lower the bottom line for consumption of non-renewable resources. The Rostropovich Mansion has been renovated as a &quot;Green Building&quot; and is operated as a Wedding and Event Performance Center called Chateau Safflyn. The Castle is held as an historical attraction and the property is open for tours on a limited schedule. 

==Holy Trinity Monastery==
The Holy Trinity Monastery for men (Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR), a jurisdiction within the Russian Orthodox Church) is located one mile (1.6 km) north of Jordanville. This monastery, which was founded in 1928, includes a cathedral, bell tower, monastic dormitory and Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary; the latter was founded by 1948. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

==Other historic buildings==
The Jordanville Public Library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and the Blatchley House near Jordanville in 2008.

==Notable people==
* William C. McDonald, first Governor of the State of New Mexico; born in Jordanville.
* Metropolitan Laurus (Škurla), born in Czechoslovakia, attended the seminary before ordination, and served at the monastery. Ultimately he became First Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, negotiating reconciliation with the Metropolitan Patriarchate in 2007. He died in Jordanville and is buried at the monastery. Metropolitan Laurus was succeeded, as First Hierarch, by Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral).

<doc id="490933" wikidata="Q975146" url="?curid=490933" title="Koji Yakusho">
<text>, known professionally as , is a Japanese actor. He is known internationally for his starring roles in &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; (1996), &quot;Cure&quot; (1997), &quot;13 Assassins&quot; (2010), &quot;The Third Murder&quot; (2017), &quot;The Blood of Wolves&quot; (2018), &quot;Under the Open Sky&quot; (2020) and &quot;The Days&quot; (2023). For his performance in &quot;Perfect Days&quot; (2023), he was awarded the Best Actor award at the 76th Cannes Film Festival.

==Early life and education ==
Yakusho was born in Isahaya, Nagasaki, the youngest of five brothers. After graduation from Nagasaki Prefectural High School of Technology in 1974, he worked at the Chiyoda municipal ward office, or &quot;kuyakusho&quot;, in Tokyo, from which he later took his stage name.

==Career ==

In 1976, he saw a production of Maxim Gorky&#x27;s &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; (Played by Tatsuya Nakadai) and was inspired, first to watch, and then later to take part in, as many plays as possible.
In the spring of 1978 he auditioned for Tatsuya Nakadai&#x27;s the Mumeijuku (Studio for Unknown Performers) acting studio, and was one of four chosen out of 800 applicants.

In 1983, he landed the role of Oda Nobunaga in the year-long NHK drama &quot;Tokugawa Ieyasu&quot; and was catapulted to fame. He also appeared in a TV version of &quot;Miyamoto Musashi&quot; from 1984 to 1985. For several years, he played Kuji Shinnosuke (or &quot;Sengoku&quot;), one of the title characters in the jidaigeki &quot;Sanbiki ga Kiru!&quot;. He played a major character in Juzo Itami&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Tampopo&quot;.

In 1988, he was given a special award for work in cinema by the Japanese Minister of Education, Science, Sports and Culture and continued to appear in films and in a number of TV shows through the &#x27;90s.

In 1996 and 1997, Yakusho enjoyed several major successes. &quot;The Eel,&quot; directed by Shohei Imamura, in which he played the eel-loving lead, won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Lawrence Van Gelder in the New York Times called his performance &quot;unerring.&quot; &quot;Lost Paradise&quot;, about a double-suicide, was second only to &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; at the Japanese box office.

===International breakthrough: &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;===

&quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; was such a major hit in Japan that it inspired a domestic dance craze. Ballroom groups and dance schools multiplied in the country after the film&#x27;s release, and people who previously would never admit to taking lessons announced that they did with pride. Director Masayuki Suo said of his lead, who until that point was known mostly for playing good-looking samurai, &quot;we thought he could play this overworked, tired Japanese businessman, and he did... He pulled everything off and took his dance training so seriously.&quot;

The film also was one of Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing movies outside the country. It earned $9.5 million in the US and inspired a remake starring Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere, with Gere playing Yakusho&#x27;s role.

Yakusho next won the Hochi Film Award for Best Actor for &quot;Bounce Ko Gals&quot;, a film which dealt with high school prostitution specifically, and money worship in general. He collaborated with horror director Kiyoshi Kurosawa in &quot;Cure&quot;, &quot;License to Live&quot;, &quot;Seance&quot;, &quot;Charisma&quot;, &quot;Pulse&quot;, &quot;Doppelganger&quot;, &quot;Retribution&quot;, and &quot;Tokyo Sonata&quot;. Yakusho found further recognition with international audiences to some extent with roles in such films as &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; and &quot;Babel.&quot; In the latter, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, he played the father of the deaf-mute played by Rinko Kikuchi.

===Continued success===

In 2009, he debuted as director of &quot;Toad&#x27;s Oil&quot;. In 2010 and 2011 he was part of both ensemble casts in Takashi Miike&#x27;s samurai films, &quot;13 Assassins&quot; and &quot;Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai.&quot; The latter was in 3D and the first 3D film to be in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.

In the 2011 war drama film &quot;Rengō Kantai Shirei Chōkan: Yamamoto Isoroku&quot;, Yakusho portrayed Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Yakusho was reportedly the only actor considered for the role; had he not accepted it, the film would have been canceled.

In 2018 he was in &quot;The Blood of Wolves&quot;. For his performance in &quot;Perfect Days&quot;, directed by Wim Wenders, Yakusho won best actor at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. In the same year, he has been selected 2023 Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival’s filmmaker in focus.

<doc id="490935" wikidata="Q1197590" url="?curid=490935" title="L'Assommoir">
<text> , published as a serial in 1876, and in book form in 1877, is the seventh novel in Émile Zola&#x27;s twenty-volume series &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot;. Usually considered one of Zola&#x27;s masterpieces, the novel — a study of alcoholism and poverty in the working-class districts of Paris — was a huge commercial success and helped establish Zola&#x27;s fame and reputation throughout France and the world.

==Plot summary==

The novel is principally the story of Gervaise Macquart, who is featured briefly in the first novel in the series, , running away to Paris with her shiftless lover Lantier to work as a washerwoman in a hot, busy laundry in one of the seedier areas of the city. 

 begins with Gervaise and her two young sons being abandoned by Lantier, who takes off for parts unknown with another woman. Though at first she swears off men altogether, eventually she gives in to the advances of Coupeau, a teetotal roofer, and they are married. The marriage sequence is one of the most famous set-pieces of Zola&#x27;s work; the account of the wedding party&#x27;s impromptu and chaotic trip to the Louvre is one of the novelist&#x27;s most famous passages. Through a combination of happy circumstances, Gervaise is able to realise her dream and raise enough money to open her own laundry. The couple&#x27;s happiness appears to be complete with the birth of a daughter, Anna, nicknamed Nana (the protagonist of Zola&#x27;s later novel of the same title).

However, later in the story, we witness the downward trajectory of Gervaise&#x27;s life from this happy high point. Coupeau is injured in a fall from the roof of a new hospital he is working on, and during his lengthy convalescence he takes first to idleness, then to gluttony, and eventually to drink. In only a few years, Coupeau becomes a vindictive, wife-beating alcoholic, with no intention of trying to find more work. Gervaise struggles to keep her home together, but her excessive pride leads her to a number of embarrassing failures and before long everything is going downhill. Gervaise becomes infected by her husband&#x27;s newfound laziness and, in an effort to impress others, spends her money on lavish feasts and accumulates uncontrolled debt.

The home is further disrupted by the return of Lantier, who is warmly welcomed by Coupeau - by this point losing interest in both Gervaise and life itself, and becoming seriously ill. The ensuing chaos and financial strain is too much for Gervaise, who loses her laundry-shop and is sucked into a spiral of debt and despair. Eventually, she too finds solace in drink and, like Coupeau, slides into heavy alcoholism. All this prompts Nana - already suffering from the chaotic life at home and getting into trouble on a daily basis - to run away from her parents&#x27; home and become a casual prostitute. 

Gervaise&#x27;s story is told against a backdrop of a rich array of other well-drawn characters with their own vices and idiosyncrasies. Notable amongst these being Goujet, a young blacksmith, who spends his life in unconsummated love for the hapless laundress. 

Eventually, sunk by debt, hunger and alcohol, Coupeau and Gervaise both die. The latter&#x27;s corpse lies for two days in her unkempt hovel before it is noticed by her disdaining neighbors.

==Themes and criticism==

Zola spent an immense amount of time researching Parisian street argot for his most realistic novel to that date, using a large number of obscure contemporary slang words and curses to capture an authentic atmosphere. His shocking descriptions of conditions in working-class 19th-century Paris drew widespread admiration for his realism and continue so to do. was taken up by temperance workers across the world as a tract against the dangers of alcoholism, though Zola always insisted there was considerably more to his novel than that. The novelist also drew criticism from some quarters for the depth of his reporting, either for being too coarse and vulgar or for portraying working-class people as shiftless drunkards. Zola rejected both these criticisms out of hand; his response was simply that he had presented a true picture of real life.

==Translations==
 has often been translated, and there are several unexpurgated modern editions available. In 1884, Henry Vizetelly published an English-language translation of the novel with some edits designed not to offend the sensibilities of British audiences. However, the salacious nature of Zola&#x27;s work (even in edited form) would see the Vizetellys vilified in parliament and later prosecuted for obscenity.

Translators have approached the title in different ways. The noun is a colloquial term popular in late nineteenth-century Paris, referring to a shop selling cheap liquor distilled on the premises &quot;where the working classes could drown their sorrows cheaply and drink themselves senseless&quot;. It is adapted from the French verb &quot;assommer&quot; meaning to stun or knock out. Perhaps the closest equivalent terms in English are the slang adjectives &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. English translators have rendered it as &quot;The Dram Shop&quot;, &quot;The Gin Palace&quot;, &quot;Drunkard&quot;, &quot;The Drinking Den&quot; or simply &quot;The Assommoir&quot;.

<text>Enrico Anthony Lazio (; born March 13, 1958) is an American attorney and former four-term U.S. Representative from the State of New York. A Long Island native, Lazio became well-known during his bid for U.S. Senate in New York&#x27;s 2000 Senate election; he was defeated by Hillary Rodham Clinton. Lazio also ran unsuccessfully for the 2010 New York State Republican Party gubernatorial nomination.

==Early life, education and career==
Lazio was born in Amityville, New York, in Suffolk County, on Long Island. He is the son of Olive (née Christensen) and Anthony Lazio, who owned an automotive parts store. His father was of Italian descent and his maternal grandparents were Danish immigrants. He graduated from West Islip High School in 1976. He received his A.B. from Vassar College and received his Juris Doctor from the Washington College of Law at American University.

Prior to being elected to Congress, Lazio was appointed executive assistant district attorney for Suffolk County in 1987 and served in the Suffolk County Legislature from 1990 to 1993.

==U.S. Representative==

Lazio represented New York&#x27;s 2nd congressional district as a Republican. He was first elected in 1992, defeating the incumbent, Thomas Downey, who had served for eighteen years. Lazio served four terms from 1993 to 2001.

In Congress, Lazio served as Deputy Majority Whip, Assistant Majority Leader, and Chairman of the House Banking Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. He was &quot;widely viewed as the most influential moderate in a leadership dominated by conservatives.&quot; From his earliest days in Congress, Lazio made housing one of his primary issues.

During his time in Congress, Lazio championed the case to award a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor to President Theodore Roosevelt for his charge up San Juan Hill in the Spanish–American War. Congress eventually passed legislation asking the president to grant the honor, and President Clinton awarded the medal in January 2001.

==2000 U.S. Senate campaign==
In 2000, Lazio ran for the U.S. Senate from New York against Hillary Clinton in the race to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan. His comparatively late entry into the race (five months before Election Day) followed New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the Senate race. Lazio announced his candidacy for Senate on all five major Sunday morning talk shows on the same day, making him the second person ever to complete a Full Ginsburg.

At the time, the race between Lazio and Hillary Clinton was the most expensive Senate campaign ever conducted.

During a September 13, 2000 debate in Buffalo, Lazio walked across the stage to Clinton and placed a campaign pledge in front of her. That action was &quot;perceived as bullying and chauvinistic&quot;, and it made Lazio into &quot;an example of what not to do during a debate with a female opponent&quot;. In 2008, Lazio commented: &quot;&#x27;At the time, I was making a point about a campaign finance pledge that Mrs. Clinton had made and I didn&#x27;t feel that it was being honored. I thought that was the opportunity to make the point. On substance, it was right - and on style and perception, it was a mistake, which I regret&#x27;&quot;.

On November 7, 2000, Lazio lost the Senate race to Clinton by a margin of 55%-43%.

==2010 New York gubernatorial campaign==
Lazio announced his candidacy for governor of New York on September 22, 2009 in Albany.

On June 2, 2010, Lazio received the New York State Republican Party&#x27;s designation to run for governor. However, Carl Paladino, a candidate backed by the Tea Party movement, soundly defeated Lazio in the Republican gubernatorial primary on September 14, 2010. On September 27, Lazio, who had won the Conservative Party primary, confirmed that he would drop his bid for Governor by accepting a paper candidate nomination for a judicial position in the Bronx he did not expect to win.

==Career outside politics==

Following his loss in the 2000 U.S. Senate election, Lazio became CEO of the Financial Services Forum. Later, he became the managing director of global real assets for JPMorgan.

As of 2017, Lazio led the housing finance practice group of Jones Walker LLP.

==Electoral history==






==Personal life==
In 1989, Lazio married nurse Patricia Moriarty. They have two children.

<doc id="490943" wikidata="Q3241453" url="?curid=490943" title="Lindsay Thompson">
<text>Lindsay Hamilton Simpson Thompson AO, CMG (15 October 1923 – 16 July 2008) was an Australian politician and army officer who served as the 40th premier of Victoria from 1981 to 1982. He previously served as the 19th deputy premier of Victoria from 1972 to 1981. 
Thompson was the longest-serving member in Victorian parliamentary history, serving a total of 27 years in the Legislative Council from 195 to 1970 and the Legislative Assembly from 1970 to 1982. He had held the housing, education, police and treasury portfolios throughout his parliamentary career, and was notable for his actions in the Faraday School kidnapping as education minister.

==Early life==
Thompson was born in Warburton, a town north-east of Melbourne. His parents were both schoolteachers. His father died when he was two and so he was raised by his mother in difficult circumstances.

He won a scholarship to Caulfield Grammar School and eventually graduated as both school captain and the school dux. The school&#x27;s new gymnasium was opened as the &quot;Lindsay Thompson Centre&quot; in 1997.

After service as a signalman in the Australian Army during World War II, he graduated from the University of Melbourne with degrees in arts (honours) and education. He became a school teacher, teaching at Malvern Central Primary School and later at Melbourne High School.

==Political career==

In 1955, he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council in the Monash and Higginbotham Provinces as a Liberal, where he served until 1970, when he transferred to the Legislative Assembly as MP for Malvern.

In 1958, Thompson was appointed Assistant Chief Secretary in the government of Henry Bolte. He would serve as a minister without interruption until 1982, making him the longest-serving minister in Victoria&#x27;s history. Of all the federal and state ministers in Australian history, only the South Australian Sir Thomas Playford IV, who served in cabinet without interruption from 1938 to 1965, and Queensland&#x27;s Joh Bjelke-Petersen, in cabinet without interruption from 1963 to 1987, held ministerial office continuously for longer than Thompson.

Thompson then served as Minister for Housing from 1961 to 1967, when many of Melbourne&#x27;s controversial public housing towers were built. In 1967, he was appointed Minister for Education and held the post until 1979, a record time. He presided over the major expansion of state education in Victoria.

===Faraday hero===
In 1972, a teacher and six school children were kidnapped at a school in the country town of Faraday by a man demanding a $1 million ransom. Thompson, as education minister, went to the prearranged site in Woodend and was ready to deliver the ransom personally, but the teacher and children had escaped from the van in which they were locked before that was necessary.

Thompson received a bravery award for his actions during the kidnapping.

===Premier of Victoria===
During the premiership of Rupert Hamer, Thompson was named Deputy Premier. At various times, he served as Chief Secretary, then Treasurer and Minister for Police and Emergency Services. On 5 June 1981, Hamer resigned under pressure from the conservative faction of his own party, and Thompson won a Liberal Party ballot to succeed him as Premier. The Liberals had been in power for 27 years and the new Labor leader, John Cain, was mounting a strong challenge to a government that was increasingly seen as tired and complacent. A year earlier, at the 1980 federal election, the Liberals had lost seven seats in Victoria, over half of a nationwide 12-seat swing that nearly won government for federal Labor.

Knowing that he faced a statutory general election within less than a year, Thompson waited as long as he could, finally calling an election for April 1982. At that election, the Liberals were heavily defeated, suffering a 17-seat swing, the worst that a sitting non-Labor government has ever suffered in Victoria.

Thompson resigned as Liberal leader and from Parliament on 5 November.

Thompson supported keeping the monarchy of Australia.

==Awards==
Thompson was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 14 June 1975 for serving as a minister. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia on Australia Day in 1990 &quot;for service to government and politics and to the Victorian Parliament&quot; and also received a Centenary Medal in 2001.

Thompson received a Bronze Medal for Bravery from the Royal Humane Society for his actions in the Farraday kidnappings.

Throughout life, Thompson was an ardent fan of the Richmond Football Club, and he frequently travelled to Melbourne Cricket Ground to watch his beloved Tigers play.

He was a Number One ticket holder of the club and was awarded life membership in 1993. Thompson had a long association with the Melbourne Cricket Ground and was a member of the MCG trust for 32 years from 1967 to 1999, taking on the role of chairman between 1987 and 1998. Thompson laid the first stone to mark the construction of the Great Southern Stand at the ground.

==Personal life==
In 1950, Thompson married Joan Poynder, and they had three children; Murray, David and Heather. Thompson&#x27;s son Murray was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1992 until 2018.

==Legacy==

At the funeral, among other kind words, former Prime Minister John Howard said, &quot;I can honestly say I never heard anyone say a nasty thing about Lindsay Thompson, and I can tell you that has to be a first in Australian politics.&quot;

<doc id="490946" wikidata="Q190210" url="?curid=490946" title="Mykonos">
<text>Mykonos (, ; ) is a Greek island, part of the Cyclades, lying between Tinos, Syros, Paros and Naxos. The island has an area of and rises to an elevation of at its highest point. At the 2021 census, there were 10,704 inhabitants, most of whom lived in the largest town, Mykonos, which is on the west coast. The town is also known as &quot;Chora&quot; (i.e. &#x27;Town&#x27; in Greek, following the common practice in Greece when the name of the island itself is the same as the name of the principal town).

Mykonos&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Island of the Winds&quot;, due to the very strong winds that usually blow on the island. Tourism is a major industry and Mykonos is known for its vibrant nightlife.

==History==
Herodotus mentions Carians as the original inhabitants of the island. Ionians from Athens seem to have followed next in the early 11th century BC. There were many people living on the neighboring island of Delos, only away, which meant that Mykonos became an important place for supplies and transit. It was, however, during ancient times a rather poor island with limited agricultural resources. Its inhabitants were polytheists and worshiped many gods.
Mykonos came under the control of the Romans during the reign of the Roman Empire and then became part of the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century. In 1204, with the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, Mykonos was occupied by Andrea Ghisi. The island was ravaged by the Catalans at the end of the 13th century and finally given over to direct Venetian rule in 1390.

In 1537, while the Venetians still reigned, Mykonos was attacked by Hayreddin Barbarossa, the admiral of Suleiman the Magnificent and an Ottoman fleet established itself on the island. The Ottomans, under the leadership of Kapudan Pasha, imposed a system of self-governance comprising a governor and an appointed council of &quot;syndics&quot;. When the castle of Tinos fell to the Ottomans in 1718, the last of the Venetians withdrew from the region.

Up until the end of the 18th century, Mykonos prospered as a trading center, attracting many immigrants from nearby islands, in addition to regular pirate raids. In June 1794 the Battle of Mykonos was fought between British and French ships in the island&#x27;s main harbor.
The Greek Revolution against the Ottoman Empire broke out in 1821 and Mykonos played an important role, led by the national heroine, Manto Mavrogenous. Mavrogenous, a well-educated aristocrat guided by the ideas of the Enlightenment, sacrificed her family&#x27;s fortune for the Greek cause. Greece became an independent state in 1830. A statue of her sits in the middle of Manto Mavrogenous square in the main town.

At the end of February 1884, the British travellers Theodore and Mabel Bent visited the island, ostensibly to witness the traditional funeral lamentations (‘mœrologia’).

As a result of sailing and merchant activity, the island&#x27;s economy quickly picked up but declined again during the late 19th century and especially after the opening of the Corinth Canal in 1904 and the First World War at the beginning of the 20th century. Many Mykonians left the island to find work in mainland Greece and many foreign countries, especially the United States.

Tourism soon came to dominate the local economy, owing a lot to the important excavations carried out by the French School of Archaeology, which began work in Delos in 1873. Mykonos became popular with international &quot;jet set&quot; tourists in the 1960s. In the 1970s, it was popular spot for Americans to treat as a nude beach, which Americans imagined to be a feature of those natural &quot;far out&quot; Greeks, and then flourished further to become a popular gay tourist destination in the 1980s. By the 2000s, Mykonos had become one of Greece&#x27;s most expensive islands.

===Mythology===
In Greek mythology, Mykonos was named after its first ruler, Mykonos (Μύκονος), the son or grandson of the god Apollo and a local hero. The island is also said to have been the location of the Gigantomachy, the great battle between Zeus and Giants and where Heracles killed the invincible giants having lured them from the protection of Mount Olympus. According to myth, the large rocks all over the island are said to be the petrified corpses of the giants.

==Geography==

The island has an area of and rises to an elevation of at its highest point. It is situated east of Athens in the Aegean Sea. The island features no rivers but has numerous seasonal streams, two of which have been converted into reservoirs.

The island is composed mostly of granite and the terrain is very rocky with many areas eroded by the strong winds. High quality clay and baryte, which is a mineral used as a lubricant in oil drilling, were mined on the eastern side of Mykonos until the late 1900s.

It produces of water daily, by reverse osmosis of sea water in order to help meet the needs of its population and visitors.

The island has a population of nearly 12,500, most of whom live in the main town of Chora.

===Climate===
According to the National Observatory of Athens, Mykonos has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;) because of the low overall precipitation, although it has lots of Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa)&quot; characteristics and is highly influenced by the Aegean Sea. The rainy season lasts from October until March. Vegetation follows the typical pattern for the region and grows around mid-autumn and ends in the beginning of the summer. The average daily temperature in the winter is around , while it is around in the summer. The average nighttime temperature is in the winter and in the summer.

Because of the seasonal cool &quot;meltemi&quot; wind (similar to the other Cyclades islands) and the moderating sea, summer days are relatively cool, dry, sunny and pleasant. The reason for the low overall rainfall is the rain shadow of the Pindus mountain range, which dry out the westerly winds. Winters in general are mild and wet, with many sunny days even in mid-winter. Snow is infrequent and doesn&#x27;t stay long on the ground when it falls.

===Villages===
There are ten villages:

==Government==

The municipality of Mykonos (officially: ) is a separate regional unit of the South Aegean region, and the sole municipality in the regional unit. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Mykonos was created out of part of the former Cyclades Prefecture. The municipality, unchanged at the Kallikratis reform, also includes the islands of Delos, Rineia and several uninhabited islets. The total area of the municipality is .

The mayors of Mykonos have been:
* 1975–1978 Φραγκίσκος Νάζος (Fragiskos Nazos)
* 1979–1990 Ματθαίος Αποστόλου (Matthaios Apostolou)
* 1991–2010 Χρήστος Βερώνης (Christos Veronis)
* 2011–2014 Αθανάσιος Κουσαθάνας-Μέγας (Athnanasios Kousathanas-Megas)
* 2014–2023 Κωνσταντίνος Κουκάς (Konstantinos Koukas)
* 2024–present Χρήστος Βερώνης (Christos Veronis)

==Demographics==

==Economy==
As a Greek island, the economy of Mykonos is closely linked with the sea. However, with the rise of tourism, it plays a minor role during summer.

==Landmarks==
*Municipal Library – an 18th-century mansion housing over 8,000 volumes and a vast collection of 18th- and 19th-century photographs, documents and Cycladic coins and old seals as well as sketches and books from the personal library of American artist John Ratekin. The Municipal Library is located on Ayia Kyriaki Square in the main town of Chora. 
*Petros the Pelican – an old celebrity of the town&#x27;s waterfront, &quot;Petros&quot; has been the official mascot of Mykonos for over 60 years. He took up permanent residence on the island after a storm in 1954 and after his death the islanders elected a successor to carry on his legacy until today. 
*Mykonos windmills – The windmills are a defining feature of the Mykonian landscape. There are many dotted around the island, but most are concentrated in the main town of Chora. The famous &quot;Kato Mili&quot; in Chora (Greek for lower mills), stand in a row on a hill overlooking the sea to harness the strong northern winds. Capped with wood and straw, the windmills were built by the Venetians in the 16th century to mill flour and remained in use until the early 20th century. Many have been refurbished and restored to serve as homes to locals and vaults to numerous Mykonian heritage documents.

*Camel Rock – a rock formation off the coast and near the windmills at &quot;Kato Mili&quot;. It derives its name from its appearance which resembles a camel sitting in the shallow blue and green water.

*Little Venice – rows of fishing houses line the waterfront with their balconies hanging over the sea. The first of these was constructed in the mid-18th century. They originally belonged to rich merchants or captains and the little basement doors that provided direct access to the sea and underground storage areas led people to believe that the owners were secretly pirates. Some of the houses have now been converted into bars and cafes and little shops and galleries. Little Venice is considered one of the most romantic spots on the island and many people gather there to watch the sunset. The area attracts many artists who come to paint the picturesque coastline. 

*Armenistis Lighthouse – is a testimony to Mykonos&#x27; maritime history, as well as a fully functioning lighthouse. It is located in Fanari, which means lantern in Greek, from Chora. 
*Tria Pigadia – are three identical wells standing in a row in the middle of the main town, Chora. They were built in 1722 to provide the town with water. Unlike most modern wells which are over deep, the Tria Pigadia are only deep as they were dug into sand where water was more easily accessible. 
*Archaeological Museum of Mykonos – was built in 1905 to house the findings from the Purification Pit of 425/426 BC, discovered in 1898 on the islet of Rheneia by D. Stavropoulos. It is one of the oldest museums in Greece and was designed by Alexandros Lykakis and funded by the Ministry of Education and the Archaeological Society of Athens. The land as donated by the Municipality of Mykonos.
The original Neoclassical building underwent refurbishments and expansions in the 1930s and 1960s and the large eastern room was added in 1972. The museum contains artefacts from the neighbouring island Rhenia, including 9th- to 8th-century BC ceramic pottery from the Cyclades and 7th- to 6th-century BC works from other areas in the Aegean. Its most famous item is the large vase produced in Tinos, showing scenes from the fall of Troy. 

*Aegean Maritime Museum – was founded in 1983 by the Mykonian George M. Drakopoulos and it opened in 1985 with the goal of preserving and promoting the study of Greek maritime history and tradition, in particular the evolution and activities of the merchant ship in the Aegean Sea. Drakopoulos has been awarded with the Athens Academy Award and with the World Ship Trust&#x27;s award for Individual Achievement for his work with the museum. The museum was the first in Greece that rescued and restored living historical exhibits to operate as they were originally designed and built. In addition to original pieces, there are also replicas of historical ships and collections of coins with nautical scenes from the 5th century BC to the 4th century AD and a variety of elaborate shipping instruments. 
*Folklore Museum – the oldest house on the island houses a collection of 19th-century furniture, jewellery, ceramics embroideries, marble sculptures, tombstones and a variety of other trinkets. The museum also pays tribute to Mykonos&#x27; traditional nautical roots with models of 19th-century Mykonian ships, maps and an anchor and canons used during the Greek War of Independence. 
*Lena&#x27;s House – this 19th-century traditional Mykonian residence belonged to a wealthy shipping family and the original furniture is still preserved. The house now operates as a museum. 
*Agricultural Museum (also known as the Bonis Mill) – old tools and machinery are displayed in one of Mykonos&#x27; windmills and, located above the main town of Chora in Ano Myloi (meaning Upper Windmills), it offers views of the area.

===Churches===
There is an abundance of churches because, for many years, the islanders were required to build a church on their land before building a house.
*Panagia Paraportiani - (the Church of Our Lady) one of the most famous architectural structures in Greece. The church received its name Paraportiani, which means &quot;standing next to the entrance / door&quot;, because it was located next to the entrance of the ancient castle, or kastro door. The neighbourhood of Kastro, where it is situated, used to be the site of a medieval castle – in those days a castle was a strong fortification surrounding a settlement – constructed in 1207 by the Ghisi family, who controlled the island at the time. The castle was destroyed in the 16th century and its remnants covered up by new buildings when Chora began to expand in the 18th century. It took around 200 years to build the church. Construction began in the 15th century and was not completed until the 17th century. Its architectural quirkiness makes it one of the most photographed places in the world. 
*Our Lady of the Holy Rosary - the only Catholic church on the island was constructed in 1668 and renovated in 1677 by Bishop Leandros Zanthakis. The icon of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus between Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Siena was transported to Mykonos from Venice in 1715. A fire on 1 May 1991 damaged part of the church. By October 1997, the church was restored and reopened to the public.

==Transportation==

Mykonos Airport is located southeast of the town of Mykonos and it is served by international flights during summer. The flight from Athens to Mykonos takes 25 minutes.

Mykonos is also accessible by boat and ferries. High speed vessels visit daily from the surrounding islands and from Athens.

Taxis, buses or boats are available for transportation. There are three main bus depots in Mykonos. The northern depot is situated behind Remezzo Club above the old Port and provides regular service to Ano Mera, Elia and Kalafatis. A few hundred meters below, at the Old Port, lays another Depot focusing on the northern destinations of Tourlos (New Port) and Agios Stefanos. The southern Bus Depot is at the town &quot;entrance&quot;, called Fabrika and it provides regular service to Ornos, Agios Yannis, Plati Gialos, Psarou, Paraga, and Paradise Beach. Small boats travel to and from the many beaches. Tour boats go regularly to the nearby island of Delos.

<doc id="490953" wikidata="Q3142082" url="?curid=490953" title="Double Dragon">
<text>is a beat &#x27;em up video game series originally developed and published by Technōs Japan. It began with the release of the arcade game &quot;Double Dragon&quot; in 1987. The series features twin martial artists, Billy and Jimmy Lee, as they fight against various adversaries and rivals.

The original &quot;Double Dragon&quot; was a hit arcade video game, ushering in a &quot;Golden Age&quot; for the beat &#x27;em up genre, resulting in a flood of beat &#x27;em ups during the late 1980s to 1990s that followed the conventions set by &quot;Double Dragon&quot;. A 1993 animated series and 1994 live-action film adaptation were produced; these adaptations were widely-panned by critics and audiences.

In June 2015, Arc System Works acquired the rights to all former Technōs IPs, including the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; series. Arc System Works had previously ported the original &quot;Double Dragon&quot; to the Master System console in 1988.

==Game series==
The first game, &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, was released in the arcades in 1987. A Nintendo Entertainment System version produced by Technōs was released in 1988, followed by a Game Boy version in 1990. Various licensed versions were also produced by other developers for gaming platforms such as the Master System, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Genesis, Atari Lynx and for home computers.

Two &quot;Double Dragon&quot; sequels were released for the arcade: &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone&quot; in 1990. Like the original, Technōs produced versions for the NES (&quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones&quot; in 1991, respectively).

In 1991, a game titled &quot;Double Dragon II&quot;, unrelated to its arcade and NES counterpart, was released for the Game Boy.

A fourth game in the main series was released exclusively for the Super NES in 1992, titled &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;. It was the last game produced by the original team at Technōs.

The Game Gear game &quot;Double Dragon&quot; is not a port of the original arcade game, but is instead an entirely new entry in the series that has gameplay elements that are more similar to &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;.

In 1994, Tradewest released &quot;Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls&quot; for the Super NES and Genesis in North America and Europe, a fighting game developed by Leland Interactive based on the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; animated TV series by Bohbot Entertainment. A Jaguar version was released by Telegames as well.

Another fighting game produced by Technōs, simply titled &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, was released for the Neo Geo arcade and home console in 1995. A Neo Geo CD version was also released, as well as a PlayStation version by Urban Plant. It was the last &quot;Double Dragon&quot; game produced by Technōs before the company went out of business.

In 2003, a remake of the original &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, titled &quot;Double Dragon Advance&quot;, was produced by Atlus and Million (the copyrights holder of the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; series at the time) for the Game Boy Advance.

In 2009, a remake was released for the Zeebo, developed by Brizo Interactive and published by Tectoy.

In 2011, another remake was released for the iPhone, developed by Brizo Interactive and published by Aksys Games.

WayForward Technologies developed &quot;Double Dragon Neon&quot;, a self-parody of the series. The game was released on September 11, 2012, for the PlayStation 3 on PlayStation Network, one day later for the Xbox 360 on Xbox Live, and for PC in the first quarter of 2014.

&quot;Double Dragon II: Wander of the Dragons&quot;, a 3D remake of the original &quot;Double Dragon II&quot;, was released on the Xbox Live Arcade by game developer Gravity in April 2013.

A compilation of the three arcade titles, titled &quot;Double Dragon Trilogy&quot;, was released by DotEmu in 2013 for iOS, Android, GOG and Steam platforms.

In 2017, &quot;Double Dragon IV&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;) was released in January 2017, for the PlayStation 4 and PC, respectively, and September 7 for the Nintendo Switch. It takes place shortly after &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; and uses an 8-bit artstyle, similar to the NES ports of the earlier entries of the series. The title was developed by Arc System Works and former Technōs staff such as producer Takaomi Kaneko, director Yoshihisa Kishimoto, character designer Koji Ogata, composer Kazunaka Yamane and programmer Kei Oyama.

In 2023, a spin-off of the franchise, titled &quot;Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons&quot;, was announced for Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, and was released on July 27, 2023.

===Related media===
A &quot;Double Dragon&quot; comic book limited series loosely based on the games was published by Marvel Comics in 1991, which lasted six issues from July to December. The comic book was written by Dwayne McDuffie for the first four issues and by Tom Brevoort and Mike Kanterovich for the final two. It features original villains and a unique story that explains the brothers parentage.

&quot;Double Dragon&quot; is one of the video games featured in the manga, titled &quot;Rock&#x27;n Game Boy&quot; by Shigeto Ikehara, in Comic BomBom from October 1989 to December 1991.

A &quot;Double Dragon&quot; animated series was produced by DIC Animation City and Bohbot Entertainment, which originally aired in syndication on Bohbot&#x27;s Amazin&#x27; Adventures block for two seasons from 1993 to 1995, lasting 26 episodes.

A film version of &quot;Double Dragon&quot; was released in theaters in 1994, directed by James Yukich and starring Scott Wolf and Mark Dacascos as the Lee brothers.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay in most of the games takes place in a pseudo 3D perspective as seen in &quot;Renegade&quot; and later beat &#x27;em ups, in which the player can move in four directions but is always facing left or right. In almost all cases the player moves to the right in a horizontally scrolling environment, encountering various enemies who attack and try to prevent the player from progressing. The player can perform a variety of unarmed fighting techniques against their enemies, as well use melee weapons such as baseball bats and throwing knives normally obtained from enemies or found on the floor. In some installments, there are techniques that can be done in combination with another player, the game also has an elbow move that enables the player to move to keep hitting the enemy without getting hit when moving side to side on a fallen opponent.

==Characters==
===Lee Brothers===

For most of the series, players take control of martial artist William &quot;Billy&quot; Lee, who battles against various adversaries such as gang members and rival fighters. He is often assisted by his elder twin brother James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Lee, who usually serves as the second player&#x27;s character in most of the games. The Lee brothers are characterized as successors of a fictional martial art known as , which combines techniques from other styles such as karate, tai chi and Shorinji Kempo.

The duo were actually unnamed when the original arcade game was initially released in Japan, although the names Hammer and Spike were given to them in the cabinet and promotional flyer produced by Taito for the overseas version. The names Billy and Jimmy Lee were first established in the Famicom/NES version of the first game and consequently used in other console versions and tie-in products such as &quot;The Original Sound of Double Dragon&quot; soundtrack album, but were not actually used in the arcade versions until &quot;Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone&quot;. Billy Lee&#x27;s name comes from a combination of Bruce Lee&#x27;s last name with the first name of his character Billy Lo from the movie &quot;Game of Death&quot;, while Jimmy is named after musician Jimmy Page.

Because of the differences between the arcade and console versions of the games, the designs of the Lee brothers tend to vary throughout the series. While the original arcade game has Player 1 controlling a blond-haired Lee brother dressed in a blue outfit and Player 2 as a brown-haired brother in red, the NES version had their hair and outfit colors switched around: Billy was now the brown-haired brother in blue, while Jimmy became the blond-haired brother in red. &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot; was the first game to have the Lee brothers sport different hairstyles during gameplay, with Billy being given a laid down hairstyle and Jimmy a spiky flat top, a design convention adopted by later games such as &quot;Double Dragon Advance&quot; and the smartphone versions, although some of the promotional art and in-game visuals for the earlier games (such as the ending photograph of &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; and the story sequences/character portraits of &quot;Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones&quot;) had already depicted the Lee brothers with differing hairstyles. Other games such as the Neo Geo fighting game and &quot;Double Dragon Neon&quot; depict the Lee brothers as identical twins like in the first arcade game.

The two brothers are shown to be romantically interested in a young woman named Marian, a student in their dojo. The arcade version of the first game (along with most console versions) can end with both brothers fighting each other over Marian if two players reach the end together, with the survivor ultimately winning Marian&#x27;s affections. The Famicom/NES version, which establishes Marian to be Billy&#x27;s long-term girlfriend, changes the story so that Jimmy was actually the leader of the Black Warriors (a change made as a result of the lack of two-player cooperative play in that version) and was the one who orchestrated Marian&#x27;s kidnapping.

===Enemy characters===
The enemy organization in the original &quot;Double Dragon&quot; are the Black Warriors gang, who are characterized as the dominant criminal organization in New York City after a nuclear war has left the city deprived of any law and order. Much like the Lee brothers themselves, the names of the gang members were established throughout the console versions of the series. The gang&#x27;s original leader is the machine gun-toting Willy Mackey (commonly known simply as Willy), who wishes to acquire the knowledge of the Lee brothers&#x27; martial arts for himself and orders the kidnapping of Marian as ransom. Recurring members of the gang throughout the various versions of the first game include the thugs Williams and Rowper, dominatrix Linda and bald strongman Abobo. The arcade version also featured two unnamed head swaps of other characters (namely of Abobo and the Lee brothers) as end-stage bosses: although these characters were absent in the NES version, which instead introduced a unique enemy, a Chinese martial artist named Chin Taimei. The Lee brother head swap would later appear in the Mark III/Master System version released by Sega, where he was named Jeff.

The name of the gang would change in later games. While the arcade version of &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; had Willy and the Black Warriors retaliating against their earlier defeat by gunning down Marian, the Famicom version replaced Willy with a nameless fighter who led a mysterious armed group following the dissolution of the original Black Warriors. While unnamed in the Japanese version, the English localization of the NES version would refer to this organization as the Shadow Warriors (or the Black Shadow Warriors in the manual), a name later used for an unrelated enemy group in &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;, as well as Willy&#x27;s own gang in &quot;Double Dragon Advance&quot;. The Shadow Warriors was also the name of the villain group in the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; animated series and its tie-in game, &quot;Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls&quot;, where they consisted almost entirely of new characters.

The names Williams and Rowper were derived from the characters played respectively by Jim Kelly and John Saxon in the movie &quot;Enter The Dragon&quot;. Other characters seem to follow a similar naming convention such as Linda, who shares her name with Bruce Lee&#x27;s widow Linda Lee Cadwell, and the enemy character Bolo from &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot;, who shares his name with actor Bolo Yeung.

==Legacy==
While not the first games in the genre, the original &quot;Double Dragon&quot; titles laid the foundations for modern beat &#x27;em up games. They influenced the creation of titles such as &quot;Golden Axe&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; and &quot;Final Fight&quot;, which firmly established beat &#x27;em ups as a popular game genre.

&quot;Double Dragon&quot; ushered in a &quot;Golden Age&quot; for the beat &#x27;em up genre that took it to new heights with its detailed set of martial arts attacks and its two-player cooperative gameplay. &quot;Double Dragon&quot;&#x27;s success resulted in a flood of beat &#x27;em ups in the late 1980s. Subsequent beat &#x27;em ups during the late 1980s to 1990s followed the conventions set by &quot;Double Dragon&quot;.

Years later, original series creator Yoshihisa Kishimoto lamented the inconsistency in design and quality of the various versions and spin-offs of &quot;Double Dragon&quot; in games and other media. He attributed these failings to Technōs losing the control of the license and allowing a multitude of third parties to work on the franchise.

<text>The three-toed earless skink (Hemiergis decresiensis) is a viviparous earless skink from southeastern Australia.

==Description==
&quot;Hemiergis decresiensis&quot; is a thin, smooth-scaled lizard with short legs, a movable, transparent lower eyelid and no visible ear opening. It is a burrowing species with only three small toes on each limb.

The upper surface is a rich brown colour with a few dark brown stripes or spots. Its sides are greyish brown with darker spots and there is a narrow dark brown line along the side of the head and through the eye.

It lays several oval-shaped eggs that hatch only a few days later.

<text>Destino is an animated surrealist short film released in 2003 by Walt Disney Animation Studios. &quot;Destino&quot; is unique in that its production originally began in 1945, 58 years before its eventual completion in 2003. The project was originally a collaboration between Walt Disney and Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, with music written by Mexican songwriter Armando Domínguez and performed by Mexican singer Dora Luz as the sound track. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2003.

== History ==
&quot;Destino&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;Destiny&#x27;) was storyboarded by Disney studio artist John Hench and artist Salvador Dalí for eight months in late 1945 and 1946, but production ceased not long after. Walt Disney Studios (later The Walt Disney Company) was in financial difficulty in the World War II era. Hench compiled a short animation test of about 17 seconds in the hopes of rekindling Disney&#x27;s interest in the project, but the production was no longer deemed financially viable and put on indefinite hiatus.

In 1999, Walt Disney&#x27;s nephew Roy E. Disney, while working on &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, unearthed the dormant project and decided to bring it back to life. Walt Disney Studios Paris, the company&#x27;s small Parisian production department, was brought on board to complete the project. The short was produced by Baker Bloodworth and directed by French animator Dominique Monféry in his first directorial role. A team of approximately 25 animators deciphered Dalí and Hench&#x27;s cryptic storyboards (with a little help from the journals of Dalí&#x27;s wife Gala Dalí and guidance from Hench himself), and finished &quot;Destino&quot;″s production. The end result is mostly traditional animation, including Hench&#x27;s original footage, but it also contains some computer animation.

==Plot==
The seven-minute short follows the story of Chronos and his ill-fated love for a mortal woman named Dahlia. The story continues as Dahlia dances through surreal scenery inspired by Dalí&#x27;s paintings. There is no dialogue, but the soundtrack includes music by the Mexican composer Armando Dominguez. The original 17-second animation test—the segment with the two tortoises—is included in the finished product; this footage is also shown in Bette Midler&#x27;s host sequence for &quot;Piano Concerto No. 2/The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot; in &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, where she referred to &quot;Destino&quot; as an &quot;idea that featured baseball as a metaphor for life&quot;.

==Public screenings==
&quot;Destino&quot; premiered on June 2, 2003 at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in Annecy, France. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 2003. In 2004, &quot;Destino&quot; was released theatrically in a very limited release with the animated film &quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot;, and also with &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;.

In 2005, the film was shown continuously as part of a major retrospective Dalí show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, titled &quot;The Dalí renaissance: new perspectives on his life and art after 1940&quot;.

The film was also shown as part of the exhibition &quot;Dalí &amp; Film&quot; at Tate Modern from June to September 2007, as part of the Dalí exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from October 2007 to January 2008; at an exhibition at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art called &quot;Dalí: Painting and Film&quot; from June to September 2008; also at an exhibit at the Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida in 2008. In mid-2009, it had exposure in Melbourne, Australia at the National Gallery of Victoria through the Dalí exhibition &quot;Liquid Desire&quot;, and from late 2009 through April 2010 at the Dayton Art Institute in Dayton, Ohio, in an exhibit entitled &quot;Dalí and Disney: The Art and Animation of Destino&quot;.

In 2012, the film was featured in the &quot;Dalí&quot; exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and at the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid.

In 2019, &quot;Destino&quot; was featured in the Dalí exhibition at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin.

In 2022 and 2023, &quot;Destino&quot; was shown on a continuous loop in the exhibition &quot;Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design 1924 – Today&quot;, at the Design Museum in London.

==Home media==
The Disney DVD &quot;True-Life Adventures, Volume 3&quot; has a trailer for &quot;Destino&quot;, and mentions a forthcoming DVD release. &quot;Destino&quot; was made available on the &quot;Fantasia &amp; Fantasia 2000 Special Edition&quot; Blu-ray disc released on November 30, 2010, as well as on the standalone &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; Blu-ray. Salvador Dalí Museum and Dalí Theatre and Museum also made available a standalone DVD release. These releases were accompanied by a feature-length documentary on the project called &quot;Dali &amp; Disney: A Date with Destino&quot;. &quot;Destino&quot; was released on the Disney+ streaming service in January 2020.

<text>Lucy Kaplansky (born February 16, 1960) is an American folk musician based in New York City. Kaplansky has a PhD in clinical psychology from Yeshiva University and plays guitar, mandolin, and piano.

==Life and career==
Kaplansky was originally from Chicago; her father was the noted mathematician Irving Kaplansky (1917–2006). Later, she would sometimes perform math-related songs composed by her father, who was also an accomplished pianist. At the age of 18, she decided not to go to college, but moved to New York City, where she became involved in the city&#x27;s folk music scene, particularly around Greenwich Village, where she played with, among others, Suzanne Vega, Shawn Colvin and Richard Shindell.

In 1983, she decided to become a psychologist, enrolling at Yeshiva University. She continued playing music while pursuing her PhD, and began to have some success as part of a duo with Colvin. When they began to attract record company interest, Kaplansky declined, choosing instead to set up a private practice and become a staff psychologist at a New York hospital. For several years, she concentrated largely on this work, and played little in the way of concerts. She still did some session work, such as singing backing vocals in the studio for Suzanne Vega.

By the early 1990s, she found herself increasingly drawn back to music. Colvin, who by this time had experienced some commercial success, offered to produce an album for her. The result, &quot;The Tide&quot;, a mixture of her own songs and several covers, was released by Red House Records in 1994. At this time, she decided to give up her psychology practice and return to music full-time. More albums have followed.

In 1998, Kaplansky joined with Dar Williams and Richard Shindell to form the folk group Cry Cry Cry; they made an album and toured at length before going their separate ways. Her album &quot;Ten Year Night&quot;, released in 1999, won rave reviews and boosted her popularity, leading to performances on CBS-TV. Her album &quot;The Red Thread&quot; has a song about her experience of being a New Yorker on 9-11. In August 2001, Kaplansky had sung harmony with John Gorka in a concert on the World Trade Center plaza.

She is a semi-regular collaborator with John Gorka and appeared often with the late Nanci Griffith.

According to Miyake and Suzuta (1937), there are more than 129 names for kenaf worldwide.

==Characteristics==

It is an annual or biennial herbaceous plant (rarely a short-lived perennial) growing to 1.5–3.5 m tall with a woody base. The stems are 1–2 cm diameter, often but not always branched. The leaves are 10–15 cm long and variable in shape; leaves near the base of the stems are deeply lobed (3 to 7 lobes) and leaves near the top of the stem are shallowly lobed or unlobed lanceolate. The flowers are 8–15 cm in diameter. The flower base color can be white, yellow, or purple, and the white and yellow flowers are dark purple in the center. The fruit is a capsule 2 cm in diameter and contains several seeds.

===Fibre===

The fibres in kenaf are found in the bast (bark) and core (wood). The bast constitutes 40% of the plant. &quot;Crude fibre&quot; separated from the bast is multi-cellular, consisting of several individual cells stuck together. The individual fibre cells are about 2–6 mm long and slender. The cell wall is thick (6.3 μm). Kenaf fibres up to 2 metres long can be obtained from the bast and it is becoming more widely used in polymer composites and the concrete industry. The kenaf fibre needs to be treated properly to remove the lignin. The tensile strength of the kenaf fibre is about 800 MPa, which makes it a suitable natural fibre in engineering applications. The core is about 60% of the plant and has fibre cells that are thick (≈38 μm) but short (0.5 mm) and thin-walled (3 μm). Paper pulp can be produced using the whole stem, and therefore contains both bast and core fibres. The pulp quality is similar to that of hardwood.


==Uses==

Kenaf is cultivated for its fibre in India, Bangladesh, United States of America, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, Vietnam, Thailand, parts of Africa, and to a small extent in southeast Europe. The stems produce two types of fibre: a coarser fibre in the outer layer (bast fibre), and a finer fibre in the core. The bast fibres are used to make ropes. Kenaf matures in 100 to 200 days. First grown in Egypt over 3000 years ago, the leaves of the kenaf plant were a component of both human and animal diets, while the bast fibre was used for bags, cordage, and the sails for Egyptian boats. This crop was not introduced into southern Europe until the early 1900s. Today, while the principal farming areas are China and India, Kenaf is also grown in countries including the US, Mexico, and Senegal.

The main uses of kenaf fibre have been rope, twine, coarse cloth (similar to that made from jute), and paper. In California, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, 3,200 acres (13 km2) of kenaf were grown in 1992, most of which was used for animal bedding and feed.

Uses of kenaf fibre include engineered wood; insulation; clothing-grade cloth; soil-less potting mixes; animal bedding; packing material; and material that absorbs oil and liquids. It is also useful as cut bast fibre for blending with resins in the making of plastic composites, as a drilling fluid loss-preventive for oil drilling muds, and for a seeded hydromulch for erosion control. Kenaf can be made into various types of environmental mats, such as seeded grass mats for instant lawns and moldable mats for manufactured parts and containers. Panasonic has set up a plant in Malaysia to manufacture kenaf fibre boards and export them to Japan.

Additionally, as part of an overall effort to make vehicles more sustainable, Ford and BMW are making the material for the automobile bodies in part from kenaf. The first implementation of kenaf within a Ford vehicle was in the 2013 Ford Escape. The BMW i3 uses kenaf in the black surrounds.

The use of kenaf is anticipated to offset 300,000 pounds of oil-based resin per year in North America and should reduce the weight of the door bolsters by 25 percent.

Reported in 2021, Kenaf Ventures, an Israeli company, is developing and producing sustainable raw materials made from the kenaf plant (Hibiscus cannabinus) in an effort to decarbonize the construction sector without reducing product quality.

===Kenaf seed oil===
Kenaf seeds yield an edible vegetable oil. The kenaf seed oil is also used for cosmetics, industrial lubricants and for biofuel production. Kenaf oil is high in omega polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Kenaf seed oil contains a high percentage of linoleic acid (Omega-6) a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Linoleic acid (C18:2) is the dominant PUFA, followed by oleic acid (C18:1). Alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3) is present in 2 to 4 percent.

Kenaf seed oil is 20.4% of the total seed weight, similar to that of cotton seed.
Kenaf Edible Seed Oil Contains:
*Palmitic acid: 19.1%
*Oleic acid: 28.0% (Omega-9)
*Linoleic acid: 45% (Omega-6)
*Stearic acid: 3.0%
*Alpha-linolenic acid: 3% (Omega-3)
===Kenaf paper===
The most common process to make kenaf paper is using soda pulping before processing the obtained pulp in a paper machine.

The use of kenaf in paper production offers various environmental advantages over producing paper from trees. In 1960, the USDA surveyed more than 500 plants and selected kenaf as the most promising source of tree-free newsprint. In 1970, kenaf newsprint produced in the International Paper Company&#x27;s mill in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was successfully used by six U.S. newspapers. Printing and writing paper made from the fibrous kenaf plant has been offered in the United States since 1992. Again in 1987, a Canadian mill produced 13 rolls of kenaf newsprint which were used by four U.S. newspapers to print experimental issues. They found that kenaf newsprint made for stronger, brighter and cleaner pages than standard pine paper with less detriment to the environment. Due partly to kenaf fibres being naturally whiter than tree pulp, less bleaching is required to create a brighter sheet of paper. Hydrogen peroxide, an environmentally-safe bleaching agent that does not create dioxin, has been used with much success in the bleaching of kenaf.

Various reports suggest that the energy requirements for producing pulp from kenaf are about 20 percent less than those for wood pulp, mostly due to the lower lignin content of kenaf. Many of the facilities that now process Southern pine for paper use can be converted to accommodate kenaf.

An area of of kenaf produces 5 to 8 tons of raw plant bast and core fibre in a single growing season. In contrast, of forest (in the US) produces approximately 1.5 to 3.5 tons of usable fibre per year. It is estimated that growing kenaf on 5,000 acres (20 km2) can produce enough pulp to supply a paper plant having a capacity of 200 tons per day. Over 20 years, of farmland can produce 10 to 20 times the amount of fiber that of Southern pine can produce.

As one of the world&#x27;s important natural fibres, kenaf is covered by the International Year of Natural Fibres 2009. The first novel to be published using 100% kenaf paper was &quot;The Land of Debris and the Home of Alfredo&quot; by Kenn Amdahl (1997, Clearwater Publishing Company).

David Brower, former Executive Director of the Sierra Club, in chapter 8 of his semi-autobiographical environmental book &quot;Let the Mountains Talk, Let the Rivers Run: A Call to Save the Earth&quot; (1995, Harper Collins), titled &quot;Forest Revolution,&quot; advocated for kenaf paper use and explained its many advantages over wood pulp. The first edition of the book was printed on kenaf paper.

<text>The State University of New York at New Paltz (SUNY New Paltz or New Paltz) is a public university in New Paltz, New York. It traces its origins to the New Paltz Classical School, a secondary institution founded in 1828 and reorganized as an academy in 1833.

==History==
The university&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the New Paltz Classical School, which originally opened in 1828. After changing its name to the New Paltz Academy in 1833, the school was decimated by a fire in 1884, after which the school offered their land to the state government of New York contingent upon the establishment of a normal school.

In 1885, one year after the fire, the New Paltz Normal and Training School, or New Paltz Normal School, was established to prepare teachers to practice their professions in the public schools of New York. It was granted the ability to award baccalaureate degrees in 1938, after which it was renamed as the State Teachers College at New Paltz; the inaugural class of 112 students graduated in 1942. In 1947, a graduate program in education was established.

When the State University of New York was established by legislative act in 1948, the Teachers College at New Paltz was one of 30 colleges associated under SUNY&#x27;s umbrella. An art education program was added in 1951. The school experienced another name change in 1959, becoming the State University College of Education at New Paltz. One year later, in 1960, the college was authorized to confer liberal arts degrees. Just one year after that, in 1961, the school updated its name yet again, to the State University of New York College of Arts and Science at New Paltz.

Amid this tumult, the college&#x27;s general education program (including then-vanguard introductory surveys of African and Asian cultures) was eliminated in 1971; a distribution requirement was re-instituted in 1993. A program in African American studies was established in 1968. Three years later, the experimental studies program (reorganized as the innovative studies program in 1975) began to enroll students, instructors, and local residents in credited and cocurricular courses that encompassed myriad disciplines, including video art (under Paul Ryan), dance therapy, clowning, camping, and ecodesign. Instructors in the program were hired by students and compensated through student activity fees. A environmental studies site operated by students and community members under the aegis of the program at the southern periphery of the campus included geodesic domes, windmills, kilns, a solar-powered house funded by the Department of Energy, and more inchoate variants of sustainable architecture. Upon ascending to the college presidency in 1980, Alice Chandler characterized the edifices as &quot;shacks and hovels&quot; and abolished the program in the early 1980s, demolishing most of the site in the process.

Under Chandler&#x27;s leadership, the college began to offer professional degree programs in nursing, engineering, journalism, and accounting. The &quot;Legislative Gazette&quot;, a journalism and political science internship in which students live and work in Albany and produce a weekly newspaper about state politics, was established in 1978.

On December 29, 1991, the campus was the scene of a widely reported PCB incident that contaminated four dormitories (Bliss, Gage, Capen and Scudder halls), as well as the Coykendall Science Building and Parker Theatre. Under the direction of the county and state health departments, the university began a massive, thorough cleanup effort. As an additional precaution, 29 other buildings were thoroughly tested and, if necessary, cleaned. The clean-up process lasted until May 1995. Since 1994, PCBs have not been used on the SUNY New Paltz campus.

The college was rebranded as the State University of New York at New Paltz in 1994.

In November 1997, two events on campus attracted nationwide media attention. The first, a feminist conference on sex and sexuality sponsored by the women&#x27;s studies department entitled &quot;Revolting Behavior: The Challenges of Women&#x27;s Sexual Freedom&quot;, featured an instructional workshop on sex toys offered by a Manhattan sex shop proprietor and a lecture panel on sadomasochism (&quot;Safe, Sane and Consensual S/M: An Alternate Way of Loving&quot;). The second, a seminar entitled &quot;Subject to Desire: Refiguring the Body&quot;, was sponsored by the School of Fine and Performing Arts. One presenter, Fluxus performance artist and longtime New Paltz resident Carolee Schneemann, was best known for &quot;Interior Scroll&quot; (1975), a piece that culminated in her unrolling a scroll from her vagina and reading it to the audience; at the seminar, Schneemann exhibited abstract photographs of her vagina as part of &quot;Vulva&#x27;s Morphia&quot; (1995), &quot;a visceral sequence of photographs and text in which a Vulvic personification presents an ironic analysis juxtaposing slides and text to undermine Lacanian semiotics, gender issues, Marxism, the male art establishment, religious and cultural taboos.&quot;
Political conservatives were outraged that a public university had hosted such events, and Governor George Pataki and SUNY chancellor Robert King expressed their displeasure. The controversy escalated when the theatre arts department staged &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; shortly afterwards. The college&#x27;s then-president, Roger Bowen, defended freedom of expression on campus and refused to apologize, doing little to allay conservative ire. &quot;The real issue,&quot; he said, &quot;is whether some ideologues, however well-intentioned, have the right to dictate what we say and what we do on this campus.&quot; SUNY trustee Candace de Russy called for him to be dismissed. Bowen later resigned.

In 2023, the institution was officially reclassified as a university by the State University of New York. The change took effect January 1, 2023, exactly seventy-five years after the SUNY system was founded; New Paltz was a founding member.

==Campus==
The SUNY New Paltz campus consists of about in the small town of New Paltz, New York. There are 14 residence halls, centered mostly in two quads. The main campus has two dozen academic buildings, including the Haggerty Administration Building, a lecture hall, Old Main, Sojourner Truth Library, one main dining hall, the Student Union Building, Science Hall and extensive gymnasium and sports areas.

The college also operated the Ashokan campus in Olivebridge, New York, consisting of another . In 2008 it was sold by Campus Auxiliary Services to the Open Space Conservancy; it is now operated as the Ashokan Center.

SUNY New Paltz has undergone extensive construction projects since 2008, totaling nearly $300 million, including:

* Renovation of Hasbrouck complex residence halls (ongoing)

===Campus theaters===
SUNY at New Paltz contains three on-campus theaters.

====McKenna Theater====
McKenna Theatre is a fully equipped proscenium theatre, with seating for 366. The theater is named in honor of Dr. Rebecca McKenna, professor of English and drama and the founder of the theatre arts program at New Paltz. At the rear of the theater is a sound booth for digital audio equipment which has the capabilities to play back, mix, and amplify audio. There is also a lighting booth with a computerized light board (controlling over 200 dimmers) and LCD video projection equipment behind the audience (and upstairs). There are 32 line sets in the fly space above the stage. There is also a scene shop behind the stage, storage area for scenery, a paint shop, and other technical facilities.

====Parker Theater====
The building was originally built as a dining hall. Parker was then converted to a theatre venue and teaching space. In 1972 it was made into a theatre production facility. The building was renovated in 1994, featuring a modified thrust stage surrounded by a three-quarter audience configuration seating up to 200 people. In the rear are lighting and sound booths with computerized light board (controlling over 90 dimmers) and digital audio equipment. To both sides of the stage are performance studio spaces. Classes are offered in acting, voice, movement, and musical theatre. On the same floor of the theater are a costume studio, dressing rooms, costume maintenance, storage facilities, and faculty offices.

Parker Theatre was built in 1962. It houses the Raymond T. Kurdt Theatrical Design Collection, one of the most significant 
collections of original costume and set designs in the nation.

====Max and Nadia Shepard Recital Hall====
Max and Nadia Shepard Recital Hall is located in College Hall, the oldest residence hall on campus. Built in 1951, it is a landmark, and is the closest hall to the village of New Paltz. Its basement, now used primarily for storage, was built as a fallout shelter, and was stocked as such until the 1980s. The only remaining remnant are the &quot;&quot;.

The facility contains 125 seats and is named in honor of patrons of the performing arts programs at SUNY New Paltz. The hall offers a delicate setting for student recitals and chamber music performances. The rear of the hall contains a small studio equipped with Pro-tools HD and a Control 24 sound board used for recording professional performances.

Max and Nadia Shepard Recital Hall is an important facility for the community. It hosts many recitals and is an integral part of the Piano Summer program.

===Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art===
At the center of campus is the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art, which opened in 2001. With more than 9,000 square feet of exhibition space in six galleries, the Dorsky is one of the largest art museums in the SUNY system. The East Wing includes the Morgan Anderson Gallery, Howard Greenberg Family Gallery, Sara Bedrick Gallery, and the Corridor Gallery, and the West Wing includes the Alice and Horace Chandler Gallery and the North Gallery. The Dorsky&#x27;s permanent collection comprises more than 7,000 works of American Art (with emphasis on the Hudson Valley and Catskill Regions), 19th, 20th and 21st century photography, metals, and a &quot;world collection&quot; of art and artifacts dating back to ancient times and representing diverse cultures. Through its collections, exhibitions, and public programs, the Dorsky supports and enriches the academic programs at the college, presents a broad range of world art for study and enjoyment, and serves as a center for Hudson Valley arts and culture. The Dorsky&#x27;s facilities include research and seminar rooms for visitors, students and professors at SUNY New Paltz.

==Student life==
===Athletics===
SUNY New Paltz teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Hawks are a member of the State University of New York Athletic Conference (SUNYAC). Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, volleyball and lacrosse; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and volleyball.

For the first time in program history, New Paltz men’s volleyball team captured the NCAA Division III Tournament title in 2016. The win also marked the first NCAA title for any New Paltz team. Three years later, they defeated UC Santa Cruz to win their second championship in the sport and second for the school overall.

===Clubs and traditions===

The student governance is operated by the Student Association, which funds most student activities through a mandatory fee. There are many clubs, fraternities, and sororities. Clubs that are recognized by the Student Association are organized into one of six boards: academic, advocacy, athletic, fine and performing arts, media, and social and cultural. There is also an on-campus government, the Residence Hall Student Association (RHSA).

The college has an auxiliary services corporation common to many state campuses in New York, called Campus Auxiliary Services, Inc. This on-campus company operates the dining halls and bookstore, as well as being the source of discretionary funds for spending by the college president and the RHSA.

The college has a foundation and an active alumni association.

The Center for Student Media at SUNY New Paltz consists of six clubs in the organization:

The college&#x27;s official student newspaper is &quot;The Oracle&quot;. In 2010, it was honored by the Society of Professional Journalists for having the Best Affiliated Website for four-year college or university (Region 1 competition). It was named as a runner-up for the National Title.

The campus TV station was WNPC TV. It has since become Hawk Studios, a video production club which makes short films and TV shows.

The college&#x27;s radio station, WFNP, is known as &quot;The Edge&quot;. It broadcasts part-time at FM 88.7, and also streams online.

There is also the New Paltz Music Collective, The Fahari Libertad, and The Teller.

Recognized fraternities and sororities at the university include:

===Student activism===

==== Vietnam War ====
There were several student-led demonstrations in the late 1960s and early 1970s, primarily against the Vietnam War. In the spring of 1967, a sit-in protesting military recruitment on campus blocked the entrance to the Student Union for two days. While there were scores of demonstrators the first day, all but 13 dispersed before New York State Troopers arrived and bodily carried the demonstrators to a waiting school bus for a trip to court. In the fall of 1968, students rallied in support of Craig Pastor (now Craig DeYong) who had been arrested by New Paltz Village Police for desecration of the American flag which he was wearing as a superhero cape in a student film directed by Edward Falco. College President John J. Neumaier posted bail. Pastor was released and charges were dropped.

The Cambodian Campaign and concomitant Kent State shootings in May 1970 led to a protest that culminated in a five-day student occupation of the Administration Building, subsequently renamed Old Main after the opening of the Haggerty Administration Building two years later.
A March 1974 sit-in at the Haggerty Building reacted against perceived discriminatory hiring practices, the state-mandated reintegration of Shango Hall (which then housed underrepresented students), and the threatened cessation of the experimental studies program in the wake of a budget shortfall.

==== Israel-Hamas War ====

Protests at the university over the Israel-Hamas War began in early 2024. On February 28, 2024, members of the Israeli Defense Forces were invited to campus by the Jewish Student Union with the assistance of the New Paltz chapter of Students Supporting Israel, to discuss their experiences serving, as well as their opinions of the war. In response a protest rally was organized by New Paltz Students for Palestine, in which over 150 students, alumni, and activists protested during and after the event. Following the event and the protest, President Wheeler released a statement, saying, &quot;I write today to share a brief note of gratitude to those within our community who helped ensure that all participants’ safety and rights were protected during the event organized yesterday by our Jewish Student Union and the corresponding counter demonstration.&quot;

On May 1, 2024, over 100 students, faculty and others pitched in to establish an encampment on Parker Quad, spurred on by the Gaza Solidarity encampments established at other colleges across the country. President Wheeler visited the encampment and asked them to dismantle the tents, but students refused. He then wrote down notes regarding the demands of the organizers, which included divestment from companies doing business with Israel, amnesty for people disciplined by the school, and disclosure of the investments the school makes. 

The following day, on May 2, two members of Student Affairs visited the encampment in an effort to get students to dismantle it by 7:00 PM. The protesters refused, and were later told to leave by 9:00 PM. When the time came, they refused to leave, and administration called the police. Officers including New York State troopers, the NYSUP, Ulster County Sheriff’s Office, and the New Paltz Police Department all participated. Police brought K-9s, batons, and nonlethal firearms. Over 100 people were arrested, with at least three people injured. One student being kicked in the face and an elderly woman was allegedly knocked unconscious.

<text>John McLane (February 27, 1852 – April 13, 1911) was a Scottish-American furniture maker and politician who served as the 50th governor of New Hampshire from 1905 to 1907.

==Biography==
McLane was born in Lennoxtown, Stirlingshire, in Scotland, the son of Mary, née Hay and Alexander McLane, and was brought to America with his family in 1853, when he was one year old. They settled in Manchester, and moved to Milford in 1869. On finishing school he became a cabinetmaker&#x27;s apprentice, going on to open his own shop in 1876. The business&#x27;s success as one of the largest manufacturers of post-office furniture in North America secured other business opportunities for him including becoming director of the Milford Granite Company, the Souheagan National Bank and the New Hampshire Fire Insurance Company.

On March 10, 1880 he married Ellen Luetta Tuck (1855–1927), and together they had four children, Clinton Averill McLane (born 1881), Hazel Ellen McLane (born 1885), John Roy McLane (born 1886), and Charles Malcolm McLane (born 1895). His great-granddaughter, Ann McLane Kuster, is the New Hampshire Representative in the 2nd District in the House of Representatives.

McLane was elected, as a Republican, to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1885, and to the New Hampshire Senate in 1891, representing the 16th District 1891-92 and the 15th District 1893-94. He was president of the senate during his two terms. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from New Hampshire in 1900, and was elected governor in 1904.

As governor, McLane was instrumental in securing funding for highway improvement, and welcomed delegates to the Russo-Japanese War Peace Conference, which was held in Portsmouth during his term in office.

He died in Pinehurst, Moore County, North Carolina, and was interred at the West Street Cemetery, Milford, New Hampshire.

<doc id="490972" wikidata="Q5360011" url="?curid=490972" title="Elgin Academy (Elgin, Illinois)">
<text>Elgin Academy was an independent, coeducational, college-preparatory school in Elgin, Illinois, United States. Elgin Academy was notable for many accomplishments, such as its Scholastic Bowl and ACES teams.

==History==
The academy was established by charter of the Illinois General Assembly in 1839 to provide students with a classical education. The academy&#x27;s original building, Old Main, was constructed in 1855-6, and is on the United States&#x27; National Register of Historic Places. It now serves as a museum of the Elgin Area Historical Society.

The original charter was granted by the Illinois legislature and signed in 1839, only four years after the founding of Elgin. The academy opened, and has continued, with a non-denominational and coeducational policy. In 1856 the first building, Old Main, was completed at a cost of $19,000 and opened for classes, but the first diploma was not awarded until 1872 when Laura Davidson, the granddaughter of James Gifford, Elgin&#x27;s founder, earned the honor. Davidson later married Nathaniel Sears and their family became major donors to the academy.

During the American Civil War seven commissioned officers, six non-commissioned officers, and 21 privates served from the academy. All together, 153 Civil War veterans, whose names are inscribed on the base of two authentic Union cannons, were associated with the academy.

In 1874, 274 students were enrolled and high school degrees were offered in the areas of College Preparatory, Normal, English, Classical, Latin-Scientific, and Business. By 1900 the football team, basketball team, and a school newspaper were established. About this time the academy became briefly associated with the University of Chicago and then with Northwestern University from 1903 to 1927 and from 1932 to 1943. The Sears family helped build the academy&#x27;s first gymnasium in 1918. A boarding program ran from 1920 to 1987, with girls allowed to board starting in 1941.

The Sears family helped build the Sears Art Gallery in 1924 and Sears Hall in 1940. The new gymnasium was built in 1958, North Hall was built as a girls&#x27; dormitory in 1962, and Edwards Hall was built in 1969. Old Main was closed in 1972.

Enrollment fell to 85 students in 1973, but rose to 425 in 2012. In 1984 the program was expanded to K-12, and preschool was added in 1997. The Harold D. Rider Family Media, Science, and Fine Arts Center opened in 2008.

Enrollment fell back down to 200 in 2023, and on November 7, 2023, the school officially announced its planned closing. The school closed at the end of the 2023-2024 school year after graduating its final class of 19 seniors.

On August 30, 2024, the campus was acquired by Burhan Academy, a new K-12 Islamic school.

==Facilities==
The school occupied a campus northwest of Chicago in the Historic District of the city of Elgin. The school&#x27;s classrooms were largely housed in four buildings:
* The Harold D. Rider Family Media, Science and Fine Arts Center housed the Kimball Street Theatre and part of the Liautaud-Lyons Upper School program, partially donated by the philanthropic James &quot;Jimmy John&quot; Liautaud.
* Edwards Hall housed the Liautaud-Lyons Upper School program.
* Sears Hall housed the Middle School program.
* North Hall housed the Early Childhood and Lower School programs.

Other buildings on campus included: 
* Sears Gallery
* The Gymnasium
* Raymond House (business office)
* Penney House (admissions, marketing, development and alumni relations offices)
* Old Main (the Elgin Area Historical Society and one classroom used daily by the academy)

A sports field complex, approximately one half-mile away from the main campus, included tennis courts, grass fields, and 1/5-mile all-weather track.

===Old Main===
Old Main was the academy&#x27;s original building. Rather than restore it in the early 1970s, the academy sold it to the city of Elgin for $1. Today, it is used as the museum for the Elgin Area Historical Society. One room served as a regular school classroom for the school.

==The Academy==

The academy offered an academic, college-preparatory curriculum. It was a member of the National Association of Independent Schools and was accredited by both the Independent Schools Association of the Central States and the AdvancEd commission. The school was a member of the Lake Michigan Association of Independent Schools, the Illinois Coalition of Nonpublic Schools, the Cum Laude Society, the National Honor Society, and many other academic organizations. It was recognized by the Illinois Non-Public Schools Recognition Program.

===Athletics===
Elgin Academy&#x27;s sports teams were nicknamed the Hilltoppers (the school being built on a hill), and their mascot was Foxman, after the nearby Fox River. Basketball, soccer, track, cross country, golf, tennis, volleyball, and baseball were offered. The school&#x27;s sports affiliations included the Illinois High School Association, the Illinois Council of Private Schools, and the Independent School League.

<doc id="490979" wikidata="Q813050" url="?curid=490979" title="The Beastmaster">
<text>The Beastmaster is a 1982 American-West German sword and sorcery film directed by Don Coscarelli and starring Marc Singer, Tanya Roberts, John Amos and Rip Torn. Loosely based on the 1959 novel &quot;The Beast Master&quot; by Alice &quot;Andre&quot; Norton, the film is about a man who can communicate with animals, and who fights an evil wizard and his army.

Commercially, &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; was not considered a box office success during its original cinematic run, but later received extensive television exposure and success on cable in the American market on channels TBS, TNT, and HBO. The original film spawned two sequels as well as a syndicated television series that chronicled the further adventures of Dar.

==Plot==
In the kingdom of Aruk, witches tell high priest Maax [ ] a prophecy that he will die at the hands of King Zed&#x27;s unborn son. Maax sends one of his witches to kidnap and kill the child. The witch magically transports the child from his mother&#x27;s womb and into a bull. Later she cuts the baby out of the bull and brands it with the mark of Ar, and is about to sacrifice him when a villager rescues the child and raises him as his own son in the village of Emur. Named Dar, the child learns how to fight, and, having been brought into the world by an animal through magic, he develops the ability to telepathically communicate with animals. Years later, a fully grown Dar witnesses his people being slaughtered by the Juns, a horde of fanatic barbarians allied with Maax. Dar, the only survivor of the attack, journeys to Aruk to avenge his people. In time, Dar is joined by a golden eagle he names Sherak, a pair of thieving ferrets he names Kodo and Podo, and a black &quot;panther&quot; he names Ruh.

Dar meets a slave girl called Kiri before getting himself lost and ending up surrounded by an eerie half-bird, half-human race who externally dissolve their prey for nourishment. As the bird-men worship eagles, they spare Dar when he summons Sherak and give him an amulet. Dar soon arrives at Aruk where Maax had assumed total control with the Juns&#x27; support. Maax has taken the children of the townspeople and is sacrificing them to his god, Ar. After having Sherak save the child of a townsman named Sacco, Dar learns that Kiri is to be sacrificed. On his way to save her, Dar is joined by Zed&#x27;s younger son Tal and his bodyguard Seth, and learns that Kiri is Zed&#x27;s niece as the three work to save her. While Seth gathers their forces, Dar helps Kiri and Tal infiltrate the temple and rescue King Zed.

An obstinate Zed leads his forces to attack the city, despite the prudent warnings of Dar, who leaves the group in anger. They all are easily defeated and captured, and Dar decides to return to save them from being sacrificed. In the conflict that follows, Maax reveals Dar&#x27;s relationship to Zed before slitting Zed&#x27;s throat and facing the Beastmaster. Despite being stabbed, Maax is revived by a witch and, when he attempts to kill Dar, Kodo sacrifices himself to cause the high priest to fall into the sacrificial flames. The victory is short-lived as the Jun horde approaches Aruk, arriving by nightfall to face the trap Dar and the people set for them. Tal is wounded as Dar succeeds in burning most of the Juns alive while defeating their chieftain before the bird-men arrive to consume those remaining. The following day, Seth invites Dar to be the new king, but Dar explains that Tal would make a better king, and he leaves Aruk. Dar sets off into the wild with Kiri, Ruh, Sherak and Podo, who has given birth to two baby ferrets.

==Production==
&quot;Beastmaster&quot; began with a screenplay in the early 1980s written by Paul Pepperman and Don Coscarelli. The two writers based their film on Andre Norton&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;The Beast Master&quot;. The writers changed the story dramatically as the original novel had the hero named Hosteen Storm who was a veteran soldier of Navajo descent in a futuristic science fiction setting. Norton was unhappy with the liberties taken with the film&#x27;s script and asked for her name to be removed from the credits. When Coscarelli signed on as a director, Pepperman became the film&#x27;s producer and brought in co-producer Sylvio Tabet to the project. The producers went to raise funds for the film at the 1981 MIFED film market in Milan and at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. The budget of $9 million was raised, giving director Coscarelli his highest budget to work with up until that point in his career.

Coscarelli was frustrated while making the film, during which he feuded with the film&#x27;s executive producer predominantly over the film&#x27;s editing and casting. Coscarelli originally wanted Demi Moore for the role of Kiri, but the executive producer overrode his choice and had Tanya Roberts cast. The role of Maax was originally written for Klaus Kinski, but he was not cast over a salary dispute. The film was shot over the course of five-and-a-half months. The film was shot in California&#x27;s Simi Valley and in Los Padres National Forest&#x27;s Lake Piru in Ventura County, and Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. Interior shots were done at MGM/UA lot.

The black &quot;panther&quot; was actually played by a tiger, which they dyed black since tigers are easier to handle for filming. During production, the tiger wasn&#x27;t allowed to be on set at the same time as children or other animals, since it might harm them.

==Music==
The score was composed and conducted by Lee Holdridge; it was recorded in Rome with members of The Orchestra of the Academy of Santa Cecilia of Rome and the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Rome. The soundtrack album was originally issued by Varèse Sarabande, and subsequently by C.A.M. In 2013 Quartet Records released a 1200-copy limited edition featuring the original album (tracks 1–13, disc 1) and most of the film&#x27;s score (Holdridge wrote eighty minutes of music for the film; a few cues could not be found, but the album includes music that was not heard in the finished product).

==Release==
&quot;The Beastmaster&quot; was originally planned to open December 25, 1982, but that July United Artists acquired domestic distribution rights and rescheduled the film for a summer release. It was rescheduled to August and had a promotional sneak peek of the film at the Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention in Los Angeles. &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; premièred in theatres on August 19, 1982. It was released in 16 cities in the United States on 165 screens and opened in eight more cities and 66 screens in its second week. The film opened in fifth place on its opening week. After six weeks, it had a total box office revenue of $3,561,475.

It subsequently received significant local TV and cable airplay, notably on HBO, TBS, and TNT. The film was shown so often on HBO that comedian Dennis Miller joked that HBO stood for &quot;Hey, Beastmaster&#x27;s On&quot;. It was also shown so often on TBS that it popularly gained a similar joke that TBS stood for &quot;The Beastmaster Station&quot;. In 1993, a programming director for TNT claimed that it was second only to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; as the most popular movie to air on the network and attributed its success to its &quot;mythological appeal—it&#x27;s more serious than the &quot;Conan&quot; movies&quot;, while a programming director for Cinemax stated that &quot;you can come into any part of it and not feel you&#x27;ve missed much&quot;.

The filmmakers arranged for star Tanya Roberts to appear in &quot;Playboy&quot; to help promote the film, but that issue didn&#x27;t end up coming out until after the film had already been released.

==Reception==
&quot;The Beastmaster&quot; grossed roughly $14 million on its initial theatrical release. Josh Milrad was nominated for a Young Artist Award for &quot;Best Young Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture&quot; for his co-starring role as Tal in the film.

According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film opened to mixed reviews. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave it two stars out of four and wrote that it &quot;isn&#x27;t bad as much as it is overlong. After one of the film&#x27;s major bad guys has been bumped off, the film inexplicably goes on for another 20 minutes. In this sort of brainless adventure film, one climax is enough&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought the film was &quot;neither better nor worse than &#x27;Conan the Barbarian and &quot;looks both big and cheap&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;When &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; begins, it is very hard to tell what it is all about. An hour later, it is very hard to care what it is all about. Another hour later, it is very hard to remember what it was all about&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a veritable comic book adventure come alive&quot; that &quot;succeeds on its own merits&quot;. Tom Milne of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; found the film &quot;marginally livelier&quot; than &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; but criticized the &quot;very basic acting, the appalling post-synching, the sets which resort to disconcertingly ramshackle models, and direction of supreme stodginesss which predictably uses helicopter shots to illustrate the eagle&#x27;s spying missions (when all it sees as a rule is the hero prancing on the hilltops in self-conscious martial arts poses)&quot;.

The film holds a score of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 5.31 out of 10.

==Sequels and television series==
&quot;The Beastmaster&quot; received a sequel in 1991, &quot;Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time&quot;. The film was directed by the original film producer Sylvio Tabet. The made-for-television third film aired in 1996 on Universal Television&#x27;s Action Pack and is titled &quot;Beastmaster III: The Eye of Braxus&quot;. Both sequels feature Marc Singer in the role of Dar. The films were followed by a syndicated television series in 1999. The television series changes the backstory of Dar, who is played by Daniel Goddard.

<text>In mathematics and its applications, a Sturm–Liouville problem is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation of the form
formula_1
for given functions formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4, together with some boundary conditions at extreme values of formula_5. The goals of a given Sturm–Liouville problem are:
* To find the for which there exists a non-trivial solution to the problem. Such values are called the &quot;eigenvalues&quot; of the problem.
* For each eigenvalue , to find the corresponding solution formula_6 of the problem. Such functions formula_7 are called the &quot;eigenfunctions&quot; associated to each .

Sturm–Liouville theory is the general study of Sturm–Liouville problems. In particular, for a &quot;regular&quot; Sturm–Liouville problem, it can be shown that there are an infinite number of eigenvalues each with a unique eigenfunction, and that these eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis of a certain Hilbert space of functions.

This theory is important in applied mathematics, where Sturm–Liouville problems occur very frequently, particularly when dealing with separable linear partial differential equations. For example, in quantum mechanics, the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation is a Sturm–Liouville problem.

Sturm–Liouville theory is named after Jacques Charles François Sturm (1803–1855) and Joseph Liouville (1809–1882), who developed the theory.

== Main results ==

The main results in Sturm–Liouville theory apply to a Sturm–Liouville problem
{\mathrm{d}x} \left[p(x)\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}\right] + q(x)y = -\lambda\, w(x)y &lt;/math&gt;|1}}
on a finite interval formula_8 that is &quot;regular&quot;. The problem is said to be &quot;regular&quot; if:
* the coefficient functions formula_9 and the derivative formula_10 are all continuous on formula_8;
* formula_12 and formula_13 for all formula_14;
* the problem has separated boundary conditions of the form
The function formula_15, sometimes denoted formula_16, is called the &quot;weight&quot; or &quot;density&quot; function.

The goals of a Sturm–Liouville problem are:
* to find the eigenvalues: those for which there exists a non-trivial solution;
* for each eigenvalue , to find the corresponding eigenfunction formula_6.

For a regular Sturm–Liouville problem, a function formula_6 is called a &quot;solution&quot; if it is continuously differentiable and satisfies the equation () at every formula_19. In the case of more general formula_9, the solutions must be understood in a weak sense.

The terms eigenvalue and eigenvector are used because the solutions correspond to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a Hermitian differential operator in an appropriate Hilbert space of functions with inner product defined using the weight function. Sturm–Liouville theory studies the existence and asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues, the corresponding qualitative theory of the eigenfunctions and their completeness in the function space.

The main result of Sturm–Liouville theory states that, for any regular Sturm–Liouville problem:
* The eigenvalues formula_21 are real and can be numbered so that formula_22
* Corresponding to each eigenvalue formula_23 is a unique (up to constant multiple) eigenfunction formula_24 with exactly formula_25 zeros in formula_8, called the th &quot;fundamental solution&quot;.
* The normalized eigenfunctions formula_27 form an orthonormal basis under the &quot;w&quot;-weighted inner product in the Hilbert space formula_28; that is, formula_29 where formula_30 is the Kronecker delta.

== Reduction to Sturm–Liouville form ==
The differential equation () is said to be in Sturm–Liouville form or self-adjoint form. All second-order linear homogenous ordinary differential equations can be recast in the form on the left-hand side of () by multiplying both sides of the equation by an appropriate integrating factor (although the same is not true of second-order partial differential equations, or if is a vector). Some examples are below.

===Bessel equation===
formula_31
which can be written in Sturm–Liouville form (first by dividing through by , then by collapsing the first two terms on the left into one term) as
formula_32

===Legendre equation===

formula_33
which can easily be put into Sturm–Liouville form, since , so the Legendre equation is equivalent to
formula_34

===Example using an integrating factor===

formula_35

Divide throughout by :
formula_36

Multiplying throughout by an integrating factor of
formula_37
gives
formula_38
which can be easily put into Sturm–Liouville form since
formula_39
so the differential equation is equivalent to
formula_40

===Integrating factor for general second-order homogenous equation===

formula_41

Multiplying through by the integrating factor
formula_42
and then collecting gives the Sturm–Liouville form:
formula_43
or, explicitly:
formula_44

== Sturm–Liouville equations as self-adjoint differential operators ==
The mapping defined by:
formula_45
can be viewed as a linear operator mapping a function to another function , and it can be studied in the context of functional analysis. In fact, equation () can be written as
formula_46

This is precisely the eigenvalue problem; that is, one seeks eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the operator. The proper setting for this problem is the Hilbert space formula_47 with scalar product
formula_48

In this space is defined on sufficiently smooth functions which satisfy the above regular boundary conditions. Moreover, is a self-adjoint operator:
formula_49

This can be seen formally by using integration by parts twice, where the boundary terms vanish by virtue of the boundary conditions. It then follows that the eigenvalues of a Sturm–Liouville operator are real and that eigenfunctions of corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal. However, this operator is unbounded and hence existence of an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions is not evident. To overcome this problem, one looks at the resolvent
formula_50
where is not an eigenvalue. Then, computing the resolvent amounts to solving a nonhomogeneous equation, which can be done using the variation of parameters formula. This shows that the resolvent is an integral operator with a continuous symmetric kernel (the Green&#x27;s function of the problem). As a consequence of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, this integral operator is compact and existence of a sequence of eigenvalues which converge to 0 and eigenfunctions which form an orthonormal basis follows from the spectral theorem for compact operators. Finally, note that
formula_51
are equivalent, so we may take formula_52 with the same eigenfunctions.

If the interval is unbounded, or if the coefficients have singularities at the boundary points, one calls singular. In this case, the spectrum no longer consists of eigenvalues alone and can contain a continuous component. There is still an associated eigenfunction expansion (similar to Fourier series versus Fourier transform). This is important in quantum mechanics, since the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation is a special case of a Sturm–Liouville equation.

==Application to inhomogeneous second-order boundary value problems==
Consider a general inhomogeneous second-order linear differential equation formula_53 for given functions formula_54. As before, this can be reduced to the Sturm–Liouville form formula_55: writing a general Sturm–Liouville operator as:
formula_56
one solves the system:
formula_57

It suffices to solve the first two equations, which amounts to solving , or
formula_58

A solution is:

formula_59

Given this transformation, one is left to solve:
formula_60

In general, if initial conditions at some point are specified, for example and , a second order differential equation can be solved using ordinary methods and the Picard–Lindelöf theorem ensures that the differential equation has a unique solution in a neighbourhood of the point where the initial conditions have been specified.

But if in place of specifying initial values at a &quot;single point&quot;, it is desired to specify values at &quot;two&quot; different points (so-called boundary values), e.g. and , the problem turns out to be much more difficult. Notice that by adding a suitable known differentiable function to , whose values at and satisfy the desired boundary conditions, and injecting inside the proposed differential equation, it can be assumed without loss of generality that the boundary conditions are of the form and .

Here, the Sturm–Liouville theory comes in play: indeed, a large class of functions can be expanded in terms of a series of orthonormal eigenfunctions of the associated Liouville operator with corresponding eigenvalues :
formula_61

Then a solution to the proposed equation is evidently:
formula_62

This solution will be valid only over the open interval , and may fail at the boundaries. 

=== Example: Fourier series ===
Consider the Sturm–Liouville problem:

for the unknowns are and . For boundary conditions, we take for example:
formula_63

Observe that if is any integer, then the function
formula_64
is a solution with eigenvalue . We know that the solutions of a Sturm–Liouville problem form an orthogonal basis, and we know from Fourier series that this set of sinusoidal functions is an orthogonal basis. Since orthogonal bases are always maximal (by definition) we conclude that the Sturm–Liouville problem in this case has no other eigenvectors.

Given the preceding, let us now solve the inhomogeneous problem
formula_65
with the same boundary conditions formula_66. In this case, we must expand as a Fourier series. The reader may check, either by integrating or by consulting a table of Fourier transforms, that we thus obtain
formula_67

This particular Fourier series is troublesome because of its poor convergence properties. It is not clear &quot;a priori&quot; whether the series converges pointwise. Because of Fourier analysis, since the Fourier coefficients are &quot;square-summable&quot;, the Fourier series converges in which is all we need for this particular theory to function. We mention for the interested reader that in this case we may rely on a result which says that Fourier series converge at every point of differentiability, and at jump points (the function &quot;x&quot;, considered as a periodic function, has a jump at ) converges to the average of the left and right limits (see convergence of Fourier series).

Therefore, by using formula (), we obtain the solution:
formula_68

In this case, we could have found the answer using antidifferentiation, but this is no longer useful in most cases when the differential equation is in many variables.

== Application to partial differential equations==

=== Normal modes ===
Certain partial differential equations can be solved with the help of Sturm–Liouville theory. Suppose we are interested in the vibrational modes of a thin membrane, held in a rectangular frame, , . The equation of motion for the vertical membrane&#x27;s displacement, is given by the wave equation:
formula_69

The method of separation of variables suggests looking first for solutions of the simple form . For such a function the partial differential equation becomes . Since the three terms of this equation are functions of separately, they must be constants. For example, the first term gives for a constant . The boundary conditions (&quot;held in a rectangular frame&quot;) are when , or , and define the simplest possible Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problems as in the example, yielding the &quot;normal mode solutions&quot; for with harmonic time dependence,
formula_70
where and are non-zero integers, are arbitrary constants, and
formula_71

The functions form a basis for the Hilbert space of (generalized) solutions of the wave equation; that is, an arbitrary solution can be decomposed into a sum of these modes, which vibrate at their individual frequencies . This representation may require a convergent infinite sum.

=== Second-order linear equation ===
Consider a linear second-order differential equation in one spatial dimension and first-order in time of the form:
formula_72
formula_73

Separating variables, we assume that formula_74 Then our above partial differential equation may be written as:
formula_75
where
formula_76

Since, by definition, and are independent of time and and are independent of position , then both sides of the above equation must be equal to a constant:
formula_77

The first of these equations must be solved as a Sturm–Liouville problem in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues . The second of these equations can be analytically solved once the eigenvalues are known.

formula_78
formula_79
formula_80
formula_81

where
formula_82
formula_83

== Representation of solutions and numerical calculation ==
The Sturm–Liouville differential equation () with boundary conditions may be solved analytically, which can be exact or provide an approximation, by the Rayleigh–Ritz method, or by the matrix-variational method of Gerck et al.

Numerically, a variety of methods are also available. In difficult cases, one may need to carry out the intermediate calculations to several hundred decimal places of accuracy in order to obtain the eigenvalues correctly to a few decimal places.

* Shooting methods
* Finite difference method
* Spectral parameter power series method

=== Shooting methods ===

Shooting methods proceed by guessing a value of , solving an initial value problem defined by the boundary conditions at one endpoint, say, , of the interval , comparing the value this solution takes at the other endpoint with the other desired boundary condition, and finally increasing or decreasing as necessary to correct the original value. This strategy is not applicable for locating complex eigenvalues.

=== Spectral parameter power series method ===

The spectral parameter power series (SPPS) method makes use of a generalization of the following fact about homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equations: if is a solution of equation () that does not vanish at any point of , then the function
formula_84
is a solution of the same equation and is linearly independent from . Further, all solutions are linear combinations of these two solutions. In the SPPS algorithm, one must begin with an arbitrary value (often ; it does not need to be an eigenvalue) and any solution of () with which does not vanish on . (Discussion below of ways to find appropriate and .) Two sequences of functions , on , referred to as &quot;iterated integrals&quot;, are defined recursively as follows. First when , they are taken to be identically equal to 1 on . To obtain the next functions they are multiplied alternately by and and integrated, specifically, for :

The resulting iterated integrals are now applied as coefficients in the following two power series in &quot;λ&quot;:
formula_85
formula_86
Then for any (real or complex), and are linearly independent solutions of the corresponding equation (). (The functions and take part in this construction through their influence on the choice of .)

Next one chooses coefficients and so that the combination satisfies the first boundary condition (). This is simple to do since and , for . The values of and provide the values of and and the derivatives and , so the second boundary condition () becomes an equation in a power series in . For numerical work one may truncate this series to a finite number of terms, producing a calculable polynomial in whose roots are approximations of the sought-after eigenvalues.

When , this reduces to the original construction described above for a solution linearly independent to a given one. The representations () and () also have theoretical applications in Sturm–Liouville theory.

===Construction of a nonvanishing solution===
The SPPS method can, itself, be used to find a starting solution . Consider the equation ; i.e., , , and are replaced in () by 0, , and respectively. Then the constant function 1 is a nonvanishing solution corresponding to the eigenvalue . While there is no guarantee that or will not vanish, the complex function will never vanish because two linearly-independent solutions of a regular Sturm–Liouville equation cannot vanish simultaneously as a consequence of the Sturm separation theorem. This trick gives a solution of () for the value . In practice if () has real coefficients, the solutions based on will have very small imaginary parts which must be discarded.

<text>The Fifth Army of the Ottoman Empire or Turkish Fifth Army was formed on March 24, 1915, and dissolved on November 21, 1918. It was assigned the responsibility of defending the Dardanelles straits in World War I. The original commander of the army was the German military advisor to the Ottoman Empire, General Otto Liman von Sanders. The command passed to Vehip Pasha who became responsible for the Helles front while von Sanders still wielded considerable influence.

== Order of battle, April 1915 ==
In late April 1915, the army was structured as follows:

* III Corps (commanded by Esat Pasha)
** 7th Division, 9th Division, 19th Division (commanded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk)
* XV Corps (commanded by Colonel Hans Kannengiesser)
** 3rd Division, 11th Division
* Dardanelles Fortified Area Command
* One aircraft squadron

When the Allied campaign the Battle of Gallipoli, which aimed to seize the Dardanelles, commenced, the Fifth Army comprised two army Corps; the III Corps was defending the Gallipoli peninsula and the XV Corps was defending the Asian shore. The XV. Corps, also known as the &quot;Asian Group.&quot; In addition, the 5th Division was positioned north of the peninsula under the command of First Army.

== World War I ==

=== Order of Battle, Late Summer 1915 ===

The number of divisions involved in the defence of the peninsula expanded to ten and an unattached infantry regiment and a brigade of cavalry before the August Offensive. In late Summer 1915, the army was structured as follows:

* I Corps
** 2nd Division, 3rd Division
* II Corps
** 4th Division, 5th Division, 6th Division
* III Corps
** 7th Division, 8th Division, 9th Division, 19th Division
* IV Corps
** 10th Division, 11th Division, 12th Division
* V Corps
** 13th Division, 14th Division, 15th Division
* Dardanelles Fortified Area Command
* One aircraft squadron

A further three divisions arranged in the &quot;Asian Group.&quot; The four divisions at Anzac made up the III Corps. (6 at Helles, 4 at Anzac) plus additional.

=== Order of Battle, August 1916 ===
In August 1916, the army was structured as follows:

* I Corps
** 14th Division, 16th Division
* Dardanelles Fortified Area Command

=== Order of Battle, December 1916 ===
In December 1916, the army was structured as follows:

* XIV Corps
** 57th Division, 59th Division
* Dardanelles Fortified Area Command

=== Order of Battle, August 1917, January 1918 ===
In August 1917, January 1918, the army was structured as follows:

* XIV Corps
** 57th Division
* XIX Corps
** 59th Division
* XXI Corps
** 49th Division
* Dardanelles Fortified Area Command

=== Order of Battle, June, September 1918 ===
In June, September 1918, the army was structured as follows:

* XIV Corps
** 57th Division
* XIX Corps
** None
* XXI Corps
** 49th Division
* Dardanelles Fortified Area Command

== After Mudros ==

=== Order of Battle, November 1918 ===
In November 1918, the army was structured as follows:

* I Corps
** 55th Division
* XIV Corps
** 49th Division, 60th Division, 61st Division

<text>Carl Ritter (August 7, 1779September 28, 1859) was a German geographer. Along with Alexander von Humboldt, he is considered one of the founders of modern geography, as they established it as an independent scientific discipline. From 1825 until his death, he occupied the first chair in geography at the University of Berlin.

==Biography==
Carl Ritter was born in Quedlinburg, one of the six children of a doctor, F. W. Ritter.

Ritter&#x27;s father died when he was two. At the age of five, he was enrolled in the Schnepfenthal Salzmann School, a school focused on the study of nature (apparently influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s writings on children&#x27;s education). This experience would influence Ritter throughout his life, as he retained an interest in new educational modes, including those of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Indeed, much of Ritter&#x27;s writing was based on Pestalozzi&#x27;s three stages in teaching: the acquisition of the material, the general comparison of material, and the establishment of a general system.

After completion of his schooling, Ritter was introduced to Bethmann Hollweg, a banker in Frankfurt. It was arranged that Ritter should become tutor to Hollweg&#x27;s children, but that in the meantime he should attend the University of Halle at his patron&#x27;s expense. His duties as tutor began in 1798 and continued for fifteen years. The years 1814–1819, which he spent at Göttingen in order still to watch over his pupils, were those in which he began to exclusively study geography. It was there that he courted and married Lilli Kramer, from Duderstadt and that he wrote and published the first two volumes of his &quot;Erdkunde&quot;.

In 1819, he became professor of history at Frankfurt, and in 1820, he received a teaching appointment in history at the University of Berlin. Ritter received his doctorate there in 1821, and was appointed &quot;professor extraordinarius&quot; in 1825. He also lectured at a nearby military college. He was particularly interested in the exploration of Africa and held constant contacts with British scholars and scientific circles like the Royal Geographical Society. He was one of the academic teachers of the explorer Heinrich Barth, who traveled in Northern and Western Africa on behalf of the British government to negotiate treaties that were to stop the Trans-Saharan slave trade. Carl Ritter himself was a dedicated anti-slavery propagandist in Germany.

Ritter&#x27;s impact on geography was especially notable because he brought forth a new conception of the subject. In his view:

In 1822, Ritter was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences, and in 1824, he became a corresponding member of the &quot;Société Asiatique de Paris&quot;. In 1828, he established the &quot;Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin&quot; (Berlin Geographical Society). He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. In 1856, he was appointed curator of the Royal Cartographic Institute of Prussia. He died in Berlin in 1859.

In 1865, a monument to Ritter was installed at the entrance to the Bruehl in Quedlinburg. The house where he was born, number 15 Steinbrücke, was torn down in 1955. There is an additional monument at the Mummental school honoring both Ritter and his teacher Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths. The Ritter Range in California is named after him.

==Works==
The Great Work

Carl Ritter&#x27;s 19 part (21 volume) masterwork, &quot;Erdkunde im Verhältnis zur Natur und zur Geschichte des Menschen oder allgemeine, vergleichende Geographie, als sichere Grundlage des Studiums und Unterrichts in physikalischen und historischen Wissenschaften&quot;, is one of the most extensive works of geographical literature written by a single author. The first two volumes were published by G. Reimer in 1817 and 1818 respectively, after which the third would not be published until 1822. During this time, Ritter wrote and published &quot;Vorhalle der europäischen Völkergeschichte vor Herodotus um den Kaukasus und um die Gestade des Pontus, eine Abhandlung zur Altertumskunde&quot;, which marked Ritter&#x27;s interest in India. It was also to serve as a transition to a third volume of &quot;Erdkunde&quot; that appeared first in 1835.

In total, Ritter intended to write an all-encompassing geography spanning the entire globe. His work was to consist of three parts:

1. The solid form or the continents

2. The fluid form or the elements

3. The bodies of the three realms of nature

Part one was to undertake the continents of the globe beginning with the &quot;Old World&quot; and work to the &quot;New World&quot;. The dynamic of old and new proposed here does not correspond to contemporary notions, rather refers to the evolution of human activity on the planet as Ritter understood it. Consequently, as noted by Hanno Beck, &quot;The most extreme parts of the world, in Ritter&#x27;s opinion, in the North, the South and the East are in practical terms as much a part of the New World as America&quot;. Due to the colossal scale of his project, Ritter was never able to complete it, but the final section of the first part should have concluded by recapping each continent and its &quot;main forms and its effects on nature and history: this was to be achieved in a brief form and used as a contribution to a survey of the &quot;great whole&quot;.

Part two was to deal with the fluid forms; by this was meant water, air, and fire. These elements correspond approximately to the studies of Hydrography, Meteorology, Climatology, as well as Volcanology. This part, too, was to be examined within the framework of the whole system.

The final part of the proposed work was to be dedicated to the interrelationships of organic life with geography and history. Part and parcel of Ritter&#x27;s approach to geography was to identify the relationship between the variables at stake. He was particularly interested in the development of these relationships over time and how their constituent components (animals and the earth) contributed to this evolution. Borrowing the concept of &quot;organic unity&quot; used by Alexander von Humboldt, Ritter went further saying a geography is simply not possible without it.

Methodology

The methodology employed by Ritter was an inductive one, consisting of compiling large sums of information and material and creating theories from those texts. This style of research was much criticized by his contemporaries. August Wilhelm Schlegel, in a letter to Johannes Schulze, bemoans how &quot;It is in fact the high time that the studies of Indian monuments be made serious. It is fashionable in Germany to have one&#x27;s say in it without knowing the language, which leads to aberrations. We see a woeful example of this in the &quot;Vorhalle&quot; of otherwise estimable Ritter.&quot; As Ritter prepared for his move into Asia the sources accumulated even further, thus compounding the problem raised by Schlegel.

A consequence of his inductive research methods, Ritter was increasingly interested in observing the planet as an organism composed of geographical individuals. In the introduction of &quot;Geography&quot;, he states, &quot;Thus the large continents represent the surveying view of so many more or less separate wholes, which we consider here as the big individuals of the earth in general.&quot; First after identifying the individuals of the earth, and then describing them through extensive research, could Ritter conceive of a whole, whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Ritter elucidates the development of a geographical individual and strives to establish a natural geographical system. Comparing Geography to language theory or philosophy, he believed that it was necessary to understand each &quot;Erdgegend&quot; (area of the Earth) and its characteristic appearances and natural relationships without relying on the absolute work of pure description and classification. In partitioning the Earth into &quot;Erdgegende&quot; he has developed a theory of area, which he views as indispensable to geographical inquiry. Furthermore, Ritter believed that areas existed a priori and were formed by humans.

Constructing a geographical theory around the area allowed Ritter to make the comparative work would seek to do in the conclusion to his great work. Elevating the importance of the area, he then investigated the peculiarities of each of the localities, remembering of course, to reflect the impact of organic life, mainly humans, on that locality. Once completed, this process would allow the last component in the method of Ritter, the comparison.

The wealth of knowledge aspired was to serve as a foundation on which comparisons could then be made between the localities or areas researched. The knowledge would have allowed a &quot;pure science&quot; to emerge from the exhaustive research. Inherent to Ritter&#x27;s understanding of the area, is the role of God in its creation. He believed the shape of the Earth functioned as a way for God to speak with humans, so that his will could be done. God&#x27;s will was the development and fulfillment of the areas created.

Format of the Work

At the time of his death, Ritter had produced an astonishing amount of geographical literature contained in his &quot;Erdkunde&quot; alone. It amounts to 21 volumes comprising 19 parts which can be roughly divided into 6 sections

1. Africa (I) 1822

2. East Asia (II-VI) 1818–1836

3. West Asia (VII-XI) 1837–1844

4. Arabia (XII-XIII) 1846–1847

5. Sinai Peninsula (XIV-XVII) 1847–1848

6. Asia Minor (XVIII-XIX) 1850–1852

Ritter&#x27;s masterwork, the 19-volume &quot;Die Erdkunde im Verhältniss zur Natur und zur Geschichte des Menschen&quot; (&quot;Geography in Relation to Nature and the History of Mankind&quot;), written 1816–1859, developed at prodigious length the theme of the influence of the physical environment on human activity. It is an encyclopedia of geographical lore. Ritter unfolded and established the treatment of geography as a study and a science. His treatment was endorsed and adopted by all geographers.

The first volume of &quot;Die Erdkunde&quot; was completed in Berlin in 1816, and a part of it was published in the following year. The whole of the first volume did not appear until 1832, and the following volumes were issued from the press in rapid succession. &quot;Die Erdkunde&quot; was left incomplete at the time of Ritter&#x27;s death, covering only Asia and Africa.

Many of Ritter&#x27;s writings were printed in the &quot;Monatsberichte&quot; of the Berlin Geographical Society, and in the &quot;Zeitschrift für allgemeine Erdkunde&quot;. His &quot;Geschichte der Erdkunde und der Entdeckungen&quot; (1861), &quot;Allgemeine Erdkunde&quot; (1862), and &quot;Europa&quot; (1863) were published posthumously. Some of his works have been translated into English by W. L. Gage: &quot;Comparative Geography&quot; (1865), and &quot;The Comparative Geography of Palestine and the Sinaitic Peninsula&quot; (1866)

<doc id="490998" wikidata="Q127635" url="?curid=490998" title="Hanshin Tigers">
<text>The are a Nippon Professional Baseball team playing in the Central League. The team is based in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, next to their main stadium, Hanshin Koshien Stadium.

The Tigers are owned by Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Hankyu Hanshin Holdings Inc.

The Hanshin Tigers are one of the oldest professional clubs in Japan. They played their first season in 1936 as the Osaka Tigers and assumed their current team name in 1961.

==History==

The Hanshin Tigers, the second-oldest professional club in Japan, were founded on December 10, 1935, with the team being formed in 1936. The team was first called Ōsaka Tigers. In 1940, amid anti-foreign sentiment and the Tojo government&#x27;s ban on English nicknames, the Tigers changed the name to simply Hanshin. In 1947, the team reverted to Ōsaka Tigers after the JPBL mandated English nicknames. The current team name was assumed in 1961 due to the team playing in the suburb of Nishinomiya, which is not in Osaka Prefecture.

The Tigers won four titles before the establishment of the two-league system in 1950. Since the league was split into the Central League and Pacific League, the Tigers have won the Central League pennant six times (1962, 1964, 1985, 2003, 2005, 2023) and Japan Series twice (1985, 2023).

When the 2004 Major League Baseball season began in Japan, the Tigers played an exhibition game against the New York Yankees at the Tokyo Dome on March 29. The Tigers won 11–7.

In 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009, more than three million people attended games hosted by the Tigers, the only one of the 12 Nippon Professional Baseball teams to achieve this. In 2011, the Hanshin Tigers drew an average home attendance of 40,256.

The home field, Koshien Stadium, is used by high school baseball teams from all over Japan for the national championship tournaments in spring and summer. The summer tournament takes place in the middle of the Tigers&#x27; season, forcing the Tigers to go on a road trip and play their home games at Kyocera Dome Osaka. Fans call this &quot;The Road of Death&quot;.

Famous players in Hanshin Tigers history include Fumio Fujimura, Masaru Kageura, Minoru Murayama, Yutaka Enatsu, Masayuki Kakefu, Randy Bass, Taira Fujita, and many others.

==Koshien Stadium==
The home field of the Tigers, Hanshin Koshien Stadium, is one of three major natural grass baseball stadiums in Japan. The others are the Mazda Zoom-Zoom Stadium Hiroshima (Hiroshima Toyo Carp), and Hotto Motto Field Kobe (part-time home of the Orix Buffaloes). Of the three, only Koshien has an all-dirt infield (the other two have an American-style infield). There are numerous smaller grass field ballparks around the country; Japanese baseball teams frequently play games in small cities.

Koshien Stadium is the oldest ballpark in Japan; built in 1924, the stadium was once visited by American baseball legend Babe Ruth on a tour of Major League stars in 1934. There is a monument commemorating this visit within the stadium grounds, in an area called Mizuno Square.

Koshien is revered as a &quot;sacred&quot; ballpark, and players traditionally bow before entering and before leaving its hallowed field. The stadium hosts the annual Japanese High School Baseball Championship in the summer and Japanese High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring. The losing team in any high school baseball game played at the ballpark is allowed to scoop up handfuls of Koshien infield dirt, stuffing holy soil into their cleat bags as hordes of Japanese media snap photos at arm&#x27;s length.

==Curse of the Colonel==

As with many other underachieving baseball teams, a curse is believed to lurk over the Tigers. In 1985 the Tigers had just clinched the Central League pennant, fans celebrated by having people who looked like Tigers players jump into the Dōtonbori Canal. According to legend, because none of the fans resembled first baseman Randy Bass, fans grabbed a life-sized statue of the KFC mascot, Colonel Sanders, and threw it into the river (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese). After this the Tigers managed to defeat the Seibu Lions in the 1985 Japan Series four games to three. After many seasons after the incident without a pennant win, the Tigers were said to be doomed never to win the season again until the Colonel was rescued from the river.

In 2003, when the Tigers returned to the Japan Series after 18 years with the best record in the Central League, many KFC outlets in Kōbe and Ōsaka moved their Colonel Sanders statues inside until the series was over to protect themselves from Tigers fans.

In 2005, like 2003, they clinched the pennant and made it back to the Japan Series, but lost to Bobby Valentine&#x27;s Chiba Lotte Marines. They were outscored 35–6 in four games.

The top half of the statue (excluding both hands) was finally recovered on March 10, 2009, and the bottom half and right hand shortly after, in the canal by construction workers while constructing a new boardwalk area as part of a beautification project. The statue is still missing its left hand and glasses. The KFC outlet where this statue once stood has since closed; the statue is now at the KFC headquarters in Yokohama. It is not viewable by the public. Since then, the Hanshin Tigers made the 2014 Japan Series, but lost to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 5 games. The curse was finally broken, after the Hanshin Tigers managed to defeat the rival Orix Buffaloes in the 2023 Japan Series four games to three.

==Fandom==
Tigers fans are known as perhaps the most fanatical and dedicated fans in all of Japanese professional baseball. They often outnumber the home team fans at Tigers &quot;away&quot; games. Tigers fans also once had a reputation for rough behavior and a willingness to brawl with other fans or with each other, although fights are rare these days.

A famous Tigers fan tradition (done by other teams of NPB as well) is the release, by the fans, of hundreds of air-filled balloons immediately following the seventh-inning stretch and the singing of the Tigers&#x27; fight song. This tradition is carried out at all home and away games, except at games against the Yomiuri Giants in the Tokyo Dome due to the Giants&#x27; notoriously authoritarian and heavy-handed rules for controlling behavior by visiting fans.

The Tigers-Giants rivalry is considered the national Japanese rivalry, on par with the Dodgers–Giants rivalry and Yankees–Red Sox rivalry in Major League Baseball or El Clásico in Spanish football. The two teams have historically had a relatively close record of games with the Giants taking 1127 wins over the Tigers whereas the Tigers have taken 888 games over the Giants. 77 of the total games between the two have ended in tie. 

=== Fight song ===
&quot;, as known as &quot;, lyrics by and composed by , is a popular song in the Kansai area. It is the official fight song of the Tigers. In Japan, wind which blows down from a mountain is known to be cold and harsh, hence the song symbolizes the Tiger&#x27;s brave challenge under hardship. The song can be found on karaoke boxes.

==Regular season records==

NOTE: The 1944 Japanese Baseball League season was cut-short, the 1945 season was cancelled due to the ongoing war (World War II) with many players being enlisted to fight, and the 2020 Nippon Professional Baseball season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Media relating to the Tigers==

===Mascots===
 is a mascot character of the Tigers. With his girlfriend Lucky, he entertains spectators at team games. His uniform number is 1985, because his first appearance was in 1985. His name is a combination of two separate Japanese words, , meaning tiger and meaning lucky. His name therefore means &quot;lucky tiger&quot; in Japanese.

To Lucky&#x27;s first appearance was on the screen at Hanshin Koshien Stadium in 1985. He appeared as a live-action character in 1987. His design was updated in 1992.

Aside from To Lucky, the other mascots of the Tigers are Lucky ( &quot;Rakkii&quot;), his girlfriend, and the most recent addition, Keeta (), Lucky&#x27;s little brother. Keeta&#x27;s uniform number is 2011, because he was introduced to the Tigers in 2011. He wears a backwards cap. Lucky&#x27;s cap is pink unlike her boyfriend&#x27;s and his little brother&#x27;s.

<doc id="490999" wikidata="Q4352664" url="?curid=490999" title="List of German aircraft projects, 1939–1945">
<text>The aircraft in this list include [[prototype]] versions of aircraft used by the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II and unfinished wartime experimental programmes. In the former, development can stretch back to the 1920s and in the latter the project must have started between 1939-1945.

==Legitimacy of German projects==

After the surrender of Nazi Germany several of the secret or unfinished projects of German military aircraft gained wide publicity. Also certain postwar planes such as the Bell X-5, F-86 Sabre or the MiG-15 were deemed to have been based on the pioneering work of World War II German aircraft designers. German aircraft manufacturers such as Henschel in Kassel had their archives destroyed in the course of the Allied bombing of the Third Reich at the end of World War II. Hence some of the late Henschel projects that were recreated later are based on documents found in other locations or on second-hand sources and not on the original Henschel technical drawings.

<doc id="491003" wikidata="Q1345739" url="?curid=491003" title="Tak Matsumoto">
<text>is a Japanese musician, songwriter and record producer. He is best known as the guitarist and main composer of the rock duo B&#x27;z, the best-selling music act in their native Japan by certifications. He also has a successful solo career where, in addition to winning several Japan Gold Disc Awards, he won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album for &quot;Take Your Pick&quot; (2010), which he made in collaboration with Larry Carlton. Matsumoto is only the fifth guitarist in the world to have his own Gibson signature model guitar.

==Career==
Matsumoto was inspired to pick up a guitar at the age of 13 when he heard Eric Clapton&#x27;s playing on The Beatles song &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; for the first time. He reportedly bought his first electric guitar at age 15, a Japanese Gibson Les Paul, after hearing Deep Purple&#x27;s guitarist Ritchie Blackmore play &quot;Smoke on the Water on the live album &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. Matsumoto has said over the years that he has many favorite artists, from whom he has drawn much inspiration, from hard rock, particularly Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and Van Halen, and Michael Schenker. He has also cited a love of classical music, which was the catalyst for the incorporation of strings into many B&#x27;z compositions. He has also worked with Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra for many years, and their work often appears on many of the earlier B&#x27;z albums.

Matsumoto attended jazz school, but when he started working as a session musician and supporting tours like TM Network, his musicianship was cemented. His exposure to a myriad of styles helped him to meld his own unique blend, incorporating elements of his jazz training, blues (his incorporation of the style known as &quot;Kansai Blues&quot; is well known), classical, heavy metal, rock, and ska. Matsumoto continued his session work throughout the early and mid-1980s with acts such as Mari Hamada until deciding to jump on the emerging solo instrumental trend catching on in Japan at that time. He recorded the solo album &quot;Thousand Wave&quot; and worked with future globe headliner Tetsuya Komuro as a touring guitarist for Komuro&#x27;s band TM Network. &quot;99&quot;, a simple instrumental incorporating some blistering fretwork, is considered one of his finest works.

After his solo album, Matsumoto decided to try his hand at starting his own band. With his session work behind him and a burgeoning production career, he started to search for a singer. After being presented with a tape from an unknown session singer known as Koshi Inaba, Matsumoto was blown away. Their first recorded session was a rendition of &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; by The Beatles, and even though the amp blew out, Matsumoto knew he had his new singer. Matsumoto and Inaba formed the duo B&#x27;z and debuted in September 1988. B&#x27;z has continued to be one of the most successful bands in the history of Japanese music, helped by the pairing of two very different musical directions. Matsumoto always drew his tastes from blues, classical, and jazz, while Inaba preferred rock music. Matsumoto has ongoing friendships with musicians such as Barry Sparks, Marty Friedman, Billy Sheehan, Eddie Van Halen, Eric Martin, Jack Blades, Joe Perry, Pat Torpey, Steven Tyler, and Steve Vai, with whom Matsumoto and Inaba recorded the song &quot;Asian Sky&quot; from the 1999 album, &quot;The Ultra Zone&quot;. Billy Sheehan recorded tracks for 1999&#x27;s &quot;Brotherhood&quot; album, as well as touring (along with Shane Gaalaas) as support musicians for 2002&#x27;s Green Live-Gym Tour. In 2002, Matsumoto contributed music to two songs (&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Music!&quot; and &quot;Koiuta&quot;) on Misia&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Kiss in the Sky&quot;; she invited him to be a part of the album after discovering his solo work.

Matsumoto&#x27;s 2003 solo album &quot;The Hit Parade&quot; was chosen as one of the Best Rock &amp; Pop albums of the year at the 18th Japan Gold Disc Awards. In 2004, he formed the &quot;Tak Matsumoto Group&quot; (TMG) with Eric Martin on vocal, Jack Blades on bass, and various guest drummers, namely Brian Tichy and Cindy Blackman, forging ahead with his own brand of musical genius. Matsumoto played guitar, produced the album, and wrote songs while Eric and Jack wrote lyrics. In March, the single &quot;Oh Japan ~Our Time Is Now~&quot;, was released. The album &quot;TMG I&quot;, which made Matsumoto go back and forth to the US for the recording, was released on June 23. Matsumoto said he had this project idea for a long time. The album mixes rock and oriental sounds. The album topped the Oricon Albums Chart in the first week. Matsumoto energetically kept working; on July 18, 19 and 20, he had a collaboration concert with Tokyo Symphony Orchestra at Suntory Hall. At this special concert, named &quot;Tokyo Special Collaboration 2004 Matsumoto Takahiro -HANA-&quot;, Matsumoto played the B&#x27;z hit &quot;Love Phantom&quot; and the solo number &quot;HANA&quot; with only his guitar and Orchestra. Soon after, TMG started its tour rehearsal. From July 30, the &quot;Dodge The Bullet&quot; tour started at Zepp Fukuoka. Chris Frazier who played songs on the B&#x27;z album &quot;Big Machine&quot; joined as the drummer for this tour. TMG had 16 shows in 8 locations including the last show at Nihon Budokan on September 7. In November, Matsumoto established his own label, &quot;House of Strings&quot;, which emphasizes guitarists and string musicians. He recorded again at a studio with songs played with an orchestra in July and released it as the first House of Strings CD with the same title on the album. It is an instrumental album including Christmas numbers such as &quot;Itsuka no Merry Christmas&quot; and &quot;Holy Night&quot;. 

In 2005, he scored the soundtrack for the film &quot;&quot;, while the next year wrote the music of &quot;Real Face&quot; for KAT-TUN. According to Oricon, &quot;Real Face&quot; became the best-selling Japanese single in 2006. In 2010, after the tour &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Magic&quot; with B&#x27;z, Matsumoto worked with guitarist Larry Carlton. Together they released an album titled &quot;Take Your Pick&quot; on June 2, 2010, available in Japan and around the world. The album was considered for nomination for nine categories of the 2011 Grammy Awards, and ended up winning the award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. It also won Jazz Album of the Year at the 25th Japan Gold Disc Awards. Together they embarked on a nationwide tour to support the album, with Matsumoto saying that he &quot;felt a little nervous playing &#x27;Room 335&#x27; with Mr. Larry Carlton every night&quot;. In 2016, Matsumoto released a three-track EP called &quot;Enigma&quot;, followed in 2017 by a collaboration album between himself and Hawaiian artist Daniel Ho, &quot;Electric Island, Acoustic Sea&quot;.

Matsumoto&#x27;s albums &quot;Strings of My Soul&quot; (2012) and &quot;New Horizon&quot; (2014) each won the Japan Gold Disc Award for Instrumental Album of the Year. He won the award a third time for 2020&#x27;s &quot;Bluesman&quot;.

On March 8, 2024, TMG officially announced its reformation, with a second album and a nationwide tour across Japan in the works.

==Legacy==
Matsumoto, through his B&#x27;z fame, is credited for the &quot;resurrection and reinvention of the Japanese guitar hero&quot;, alongside, and in comparison to, X Japan guitarist hide, as a model of guitarist more interested in technique, technology, and equipment, popularizing the electric guitar as a mass media product in Japan. Terry Burrows considered him the &quot;most highly regarded guitarist to emerge from Asia&quot;. Matsumoto ranked first in a 2011 poll conducted by the Japanese search engine goo on who the Japanese people thought was the best guitarist to represent Japan. In 2019, Matsumoto&#x27;s song was named the 51st best guitar instrumental by &quot;Young Guitar Magazine&quot;. In April 2022, the Japanese government awarded Matsumoto the Medal with Dark Blue Ribbon for his charitable contributions.

==Musical equipment==
Matsumoto was given his own Signature Model Les Paul from Gibson in 1999. Matsumoto was added to the Gibson signature artist club as the first guitarist from Asia. He currently holds the record with 7 different signature models produced, including &quot;Model Double Cutaway&quot;. His Les Paul model was also adapted into an Epiphone. In recent years, the signature model &quot;Doublecut Custom Ebony&quot; was released.

<text>A or family register is a Japanese family registry. Japanese law requires all Japanese households (basically defined as married couples and their unmarried children) to make notifications of their vital records (such as births, adoptions, deaths, marriages and divorces) to their local authority, which compiles such records encompassing all Japanese citizens within their jurisdiction.

Marriages, divorces by mutual consent, acknowledgements of paternity of non-marital children and adoptions (among others) become legally effective only when such events are recorded in the &quot;koseki&quot;. Births and deaths become legally effective as they happen, but such events must be filed by family members or other persons as allowed by law. Loss of Japanese or foreign nationalities have to be recorded in the &quot;koseki&quot;, too.

==Format==
There are two main types of certified copies of &quot;koseki&quot;: the Comprehensive Copy of &quot;Koseki&quot; (戸籍謄本, &quot;koseki tōhon&quot;) and Selected Copy of &quot;Koseki&quot; (戸籍抄本, &quot;koseki shōhon&quot;). The comprehensive &quot;koseki&quot; is a record of all family members, while the selected &quot;koseki&quot; is the information for only one individual family member.
A typical &quot;koseki&quot; has one page for the household&#x27;s parents and their first two children: additional children are recorded on additional pages. Any changes to this information have to be sealed by an official registrar.

The following items are recorded in the &quot;koseki&quot;.
(Law of Family Register, (戸籍法, &quot;kosekihō&quot;), articles 9 and 13.)

*(header) registered domicile (&quot;honseki&quot;)
*(header) family name and given name of the &quot;head of the &quot;koseki&quot;&quot;, i.e. the first person shown on the &quot;koseki&quot;. This family name will be shared by all the members of this &quot;koseki&quot;.
*given name
*date of birth
*date of records and causes (marriage, death, adoption, etc.)
*names of natural parents or, when there is a plenary adoption, name of adoptive parents
*if adopted (non-plenary), names of the adoptive father and/or mother
*if married, whether the person is a husband or a wife
*if transferred from another &quot;koseki&quot;, the former &quot;koseki&quot;&#x27;s header information
*other matters as specified by ordinance.

When an individual is transferred from one &quot;koseki&quot; to another, certain pieces of registered information are duplicated onto the new &quot;koseki&quot;, while others are not. For example, information regarding birth, current marital status, and loss of foreign nationalities is transcribed without alteration. Conversely, details concerning divorces or acquisition of Japanese nationality through naturalization are not included in the new &quot;koseki&quot;. However, former &quot;koseki&quot;, referred to as &quot;joseki&quot; when all its members are deceased or transferred, are not discarded. Copies of a &quot;joseki&quot; can be obtained when necessary.

Additionally, the pronunciations in katakana of the family name and each member&#x27;s given name will be also recorded on the &quot;koseki&quot;. This clause becomes effective from some point in 2025, see dedicated section.

==History==
Introduced in the 6th century, the original population census in Japan was called the or the . This census was introduced under the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system of governance. During the Bakufu, there were four major forms of population registration: the (Registry of Human Categories), the (Religious Inquisition Registry) also called the &quot;shūmon aratamechō&quot;, the (Five Household Registry) and the (Death Registry). The &quot;shūmon jinbetsu aratamechō&quot; was created around 1670 and lasted almost 200 years. It combined social and religious registration, and data was renewed annually. Several categories of outcasts were not registered at all under this system, or were registered in specific registers, for instance the burakumin. The modern koseki, encompassing all of Japan&#x27;s citizenry, appeared in 1872, immediately following the Meiji Restoration. This was the first time in history that all Japanese people were required to have family names as well as given names. Although all previous social categories were abolished and almost all Japanese people were recorded as &quot;heimin&quot; (commoners), some minorities became labelled as &quot;new commoner&quot; or &quot;original eta&quot; (&quot;shinheimin&quot; or &quot;motoeta&quot;), and discrimination went on. Problems also happened at the edge of the national territory, for instance in the Ogasawara Islands.

During the course of the Japanese Empire, a number of reforms were carried out after 1910 to eliminate double standards in the koseki system. In general, though, residents of the Empire&#x27;s colonies held external registries (&quot;gaichi koseki&quot;) (based on the preexisting Hoju) and Japanese held domestic registries (&quot;naichi koseki&quot;).

After the full revision of the Family Register Act in 1947 (enforced the following year), the household, known as &quot;ie&quot; were redefined to a narrower scope (married couples and their unmarried children), thus limiting the maximum number of generations under the same &quot;koseki&quot; to two generations.

In 2003, the &quot;GID Law&quot; was enacted, enabling people with &quot;gender identity disorder&quot; (GID) or gender dysphoria to change their gender on their &quot;koseki&quot; provided they meet certain conditions. Persons diagnosed with GID must seek an official diagnosis with letters of support from two independent psychiatrists to change their &quot;koseki&quot; gender. A person with functional reproductive glands or a married person cannot change their &quot;koseki&quot; gender.

== Imperial family ==

Members of the Imperial Household of Japan are registered not in a koseki but in a Register of Imperial Lineage (皇統譜, &quot;kōtōfu&quot;) instead, according to Article 26 of the Imperial House Law. The Register of Imperial Lineage is composed of the &quot;Taitōfu&quot; which handles matters related the emperor and the empress, and the &quot;Kōzokufu&quot; which handles matters related to the other members of the Imperial Household.

== Citizenship ==
The &quot;koseki&quot; serves as a certificate of citizenship (nationality), as only Japanese citizens have one. Providing a certified copy of &quot;koseki&quot; is mandatory to apply for a Japanese passport.

When a person is naturalized to Japan (authorized by the Minister of Justice and properly noticed through the Official Gazette), this person has to declare the creation of a new &quot;koseki&quot; or join her/his Japanese spouse&#x27;s &quot;koseki&quot; within one month after the notice. Besides, any loss of a foreign nationality that was not already lost before the naturalization date should be registered on the &quot;koseki&quot; within one month from the date of learning the fact of loss of foreign nationality (Family Register Act, article 103).

Foreign nationals may be mentioned in a &quot;koseki&quot;, for example, as a spouse or parent of a Japanese citizen, but they are not registered as a genuine member in the &quot;koseki&quot;, which is strictly for Japanese nationals.

== Address history and domicile transfers ==
The &quot;koseki&quot; system is different from the &quot;jūminhyō&quot; residency registration, which holds current address information of both Japanese and foreign nationals. For Japanese nationals, their residency registration is linked with their &quot;koseki&quot;. Each residency change is reported by the municipality in which the person actually lives to the &quot;honseki-chi&quot; (the municipality of the registered domicile), which records the residency history on a supplementary page called &quot;koseki no fuhyō&quot; (). &quot;Koseki&quot; thus serves as the record of all the address history. Addresses abroad are also included, through the Overseas Residential Registration.

It is possible to transfer a &quot;koseki&quot; from one registered domicile to another. Any domiciliation is possible within the boundaries of the Japanese territory. After a transfer, some of the information shown on the preceding &quot;koseki&quot;, including the history of addresses, are not transcribed to the new one. But it is still possible to return to the previous &quot;koseki&quot; information because the preceding &quot;koseki&quot; domicile and name is always noted, allowing traceability. A &quot;koseki&quot; is supposed to be kept at least 150 years by the municipality in charge, even after all its members have passed away, been transferred to other &quot;koseki&quot; or have lost their Japanese nationality.

== &quot;Furigana&quot; of names ==
Japanese names are written in kanji (mostly), hiragana, katakana, and other symbols (iteration marks or the prolonged sound mark). Since kanji characters are not phonetic, the pronunciation of most names is uncertain. To address this issue, laws have been amended in June 2023 to introduce a system that records the pronunciation of names in the family registry through the &quot;furigana&quot; of name. The actual kickoff of this new system is planned May 2025.

The &quot;furigana&quot; of name is a notation in kana characters that represents the pronunciation of family names and given names recorded in the &quot;koseki&quot; of Japanese nationals. It serves as important supplementary information for various identification documents and contributes to the promotion of digitization in society. However, it does not replace the actual names themselves.

The introduction of this system is driven by the challenges posed by uncertain pronunciation, such as the presence of multiple registered readings for the same person. Additionally, there have been discussions regarding the social issues surrounding unconventional name readings. When the law is enforced, it is expected that extremely unconventional names will not be accepted when registering new births.

== Privacy concerns and other criticisms ==
Information provided in &quot;koseki&quot; is detailed and sensitive and makes discrimination possible against such groups as burakumin or illegitimate children and unwed mothers, for example. As the burakumin liberation movement gained strength in postwar Japan some changes were made to family registries. In 1974 a notice that prohibited employers from asking prospective employees to show their family registry was released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In 1975 one&#x27;s lineage name was deleted and in 1976 access to family registries was restricted. As of April 2007, anyone interested was eligible to get a copy of someone else&#x27;s &quot;koseki&quot;. However, on May 1, 2008, a new law was implemented to limit the persons eligible for a copy to the persons whose names are recorded in a given &quot;koseki&quot; and those who need such a copy to exercise their due rights (debt collectors, executors of wills). Anyone who is listed on a koseki, even if their name has been crossed off by reason of divorce and even if they are not a Japanese citizen, is eligible to get a copy of that koseki. One can obtain a copy in person or by mail. Lawyers can also obtain copies of any &quot;koseki&quot; if a person listed is involved in legal proceedings.

The &quot;koseki&quot; simultaneously fills the function of birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, and the census in other countries. It is based on family rather than each individual. For married couples, only one family name may appear on the koseki, which means that one person has to abandon his or her family name when he or she marries. Usually it is the woman. On December 15, 2015, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Japan&#x27;s Supreme Court upheld a legal provision forcing married couples to use the same surname. Plaintiffs had argued that the legal provision amounts to &quot;de facto discrimination against women.&quot;

Another concern is where children are not registered on the &quot;koseki&quot;. The onus is on the parents to register the child, but there have been cases where this has not happened.

In September 2010, the Japanese government completed research into 230,000 &quot;missing&quot; persons age 100 years old or more. Some journalists claimed koseki is an antiquated system that enabled younger family members to receive the pensions of deceased elderly relatives.

&quot;Koseki&quot; tends to be criticized by commentators or activists situated on the left wing of the Japanese political spectrum, because its rigid framework functions as a barrier against societal innovations, and because the history of any citizen is easily searchable. On the contrary, other views praise the state-of-the-art reliability and traceability offered by this system for more than 150 years.

==Family registries in other countries==
A similar registration system exists within the public administration structures of all East Asian states influenced by the ancient Chinese system of government. The local pronunciations of the name of the household register varies, but all are derived from the same Chinese characters as that for &quot;koseki&quot; (in traditional ). These states include People&#x27;s Republic of China (&quot;hukou&quot;), Republic of China (Taiwan) (&quot;hùjí&quot;), North Korea (&quot;hoju&quot;, &quot;hojeok&quot;, &quot;hojok&quot;) and in Vietnam (&quot;hộ khẩu&quot;). In South Korea, the &quot;hoju&quot; system was abolished in 2008.

<text>Gomashio (hiragana: ) is a dry condiment, similar to &quot;furikake&quot;, made from unhulled and . It is often used in Japanese cuisine, such as a topping for &quot;sekihan&quot;. It is also sometimes sprinkled over plain rice or &quot;onigiri&quot;. Some commercially sold gomashio also has sugar mixed in with the salt.

==Composition and use==
The sesame seeds used to make &quot;gomashio&quot; may be either tan or black in color. They are toasted before being mixed with the salt. Occasionally the salt is also toasted. The ratio of sesame seeds to salt varies according to taste and diet, generally ranging between 5:1 (5 parts sesame seeds to 1 part salt) and 15:1. &quot;Gomashio&quot; is often homemade, though it is also commercially available in glass or plastic containers.

&quot;Gomashio&quot; is also a part of the macrobiotic diet, where it is used as a healthier alternative to ordinary salt. Generally, the &quot;gomashio&quot; used in macrobiotic cuisine will contain less salt than traditional Japanese &quot;gomashio&quot; (a ratio of 18 parts sesame seeds to 1 part salt is recommended for some individuals with a particularly restricted diet) and made by hand grinding in a &quot;suribachi&quot;.

The word &quot;gomashio&quot; is also used in the Japanese language to describe a head of hair containing both white and black hair strands that intermingle, similar to the English idiom &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="491010" wikidata="Q6383788" url="?curid=491010" title="Keio Shonan-Fujisawa Junior and Senior High School">
<text>is located on the Shonan Fujisawa Campus of Keio University in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Since its founding in 1992, the school has been commonly known as Keio SFC, or simply SFC. It is one of the prestigious private secondary schools in the Tokyo area, due to its rich curriculum and environment.

The overwhelming majority (99%) of its students advance to Keio University. In 2006, for example, out of 237 students who entered the senior or final year, 232 were admitted to the various campuses of Keio University.

== School ==
The school is one of five schools affiliated with Keio University. The school is a combined Junior and Senior High, with grades seven through twelve. There are 160 students per grade in Junior High, with another 80 students joining in the first year of Senior High, bringing the total to 240 students per grade. Most of the teachers teach in both the Junior and Senior schools, which share the same buildings, which is uncommon in Japan.

== Student life==
Most students live in Kanagawa Prefecture and the typical commuting time is 90 minutes. About a quarter of the students are returnees who have lived abroad in various countries. Some of these students have a high English language proficiency, and the school emphasizes English education as well as information technology in its curriculum.

The school operates on a trimester system with a five-week summer vacation and a three-week break at the end spanning late December and early January.

Like other university-attached private high schools in Japan, students in their final year of high school are exempt from taking entrance exams in order to enter the affiliated university. Students in their last year can specify which Keio University faculty they wish to enter and are granted admission to a specific faculty dependent on their academic grades and other intangibles. This frees up enormous amounts of time for extra-curricular activities. Most students belong to clubs of some sort (sports, music, arts, dance, etc.) and will typically spend 6 to 15 hours a week on club pursuits.

The school is co-educational and the number of boys and girls is effectively equal.

Most of the teaching staff are Keio University graduates, many with master&#x27;s degrees, which is unusual among secondary educators in Japan.

==Notable alumni==
*Sayuri Hori, announcer for NHK
*Mio Matsumura, announcer for Fuji Television
*Mina Fujii, actress
*Natsuki Uchiyama, former member of AKB48
*Katsuhiro Suzuki, actor
*Taka, lead vocalist of One Ok Rock

<text>The Gospellers (ゴスペラーズ) are a Japanese a cappella vocal group made up of Tetsuya Murakami, Kaoru Kurosawa, Yuji Sakai, Yoichi Kitayama and Yutaka Yasuoka.

==History==
Originally formed by Murakami and Kurosawa (along with 4 other members) in 1991 as a group within a college chorus club &quot;Street Corner Symphony&quot; at the University of Waseda, they recruited 3 new members in order to fill the vacancy (4 members previously left the group due to their job placement activities) for the recording of &quot;The Gospellers&quot;, their first major label release in 1994. They spent the next 6 years working towards national recognition, releasing 13 singles and 5 albums, until they finally came up with a hit single &quot;Towa ni&quot;, which stayed in the Oricon chart ranking for 44 consecutive weeks in 2000 and 2001. They became the first a cappella group to be in the top 3 of the chart in Japan with their 16th single, &quot;Hitori&quot;.

In early 2006, the group made a side-project release, Gosperats, which featured the members in blackface and singing with more soul and jazz-like accompaniment, with Rats &amp; Star members Masayuki Suzuki, Nobuyoshi Kuwano and Yoshio Sato, who originally, along with such a style, established the popularity of R&amp;B and Doo-wop in the 1980s in Japan.

In the first edition of the Japanese ice show Fantasy on Ice in 2010, the Gospellers made an appearance as guest artists. They performed together with former figure skater and figure skating commentator, Junko Yaginuma, to the song &quot;1, 2, 3 for 5&quot; amongst others.

Their single &quot;Sky High&quot; was used as the opening theme for the anime Nodame Cantabile: Paris.

The image song for the Japanese version of The Wild is called &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; by the band.

<text>HMS &quot;Ambush&quot; is an &quot;Astute&quot;-class nuclear-powered attack submarine of the Royal Navy, the second boat of her class.

&quot;Ambush&quot; is the third vessel, and the second submarine, to bear the name in Royal Naval service. She was ordered in 1997, laid down in 2003 and commissioned in 2013.

==Design==

===Propulsion===
&quot;Ambush&quot;&#x27;s nuclear reactor will not need to be refuelled during the boat&#x27;s 25-year service. Since the submarine can purify water and air, she will be able to circumnavigate the planet without resurfacing. The main limit is that the submarine will only be able to carry three months&#x27; supply of food for 98 officers and ratings.

===Weapons===
&quot;Ambush&quot; has provision for up-to 38 weapons in six torpedo tubes. The submarine is capable of using Tomahawk Block IV land-attack missiles with a range of and Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Ambush&quot; was ordered from GEC&#x27;s Marconi Marine (now BAE Systems Submarine Solutions) on 17 March 1997. She was laid down at Barrow-in-Furness on 22 October 2003, officially named on 16 December 2010, launched on 6 January 2011, completed her initial dive test on 30 September 2011, and departed Barrow for sea trials on 15 September 2012. &quot;Ambush&quot; was commissioned in a ceremony at HM Naval Base Clyde on 1 March 2013.

==Operational history==
Following her commissioning, &quot;Ambush&quot; continued sea trials throughout much of 2013. In May 2013, she carried out berthing trials with forward support ship and, in August 2013, she successfully conducted her first live torpedo and cruise missile firings.

In October 2014, &quot;Ambush&quot; completed a maiden deployment to the United States and Brazil, visiting Florida&#x27;s Port Canaveral along the way and taking part in the centenary celebrations of the Brazilian submarine force. In April 2015, &quot;Ambush&quot; participated in Exercise Joint Warrior, the largest military exercise held in Europe, alongside 55 other naval ships of NATO navies. She further participated in Exercise Dynamic Manta 15.

===Collision===

On 20 July 2016, while surfacing on an exercise in the Strait of Gibraltar, &quot;Ambush&quot; collided with the Panama-flagged merchant ship , sustaining significant damage to the top of her conning tower where some of her sonar equipment is housed. It was reported that no crew members were injured during the collision and that the submarine&#x27;s nuclear reactor section remained completely undamaged. Repairs cost £2.1 million and the commander, who was training a group of students at the time, was sentenced to forfeiting a year of seniority for negligently hazarding the vessel.

As of early 2024, HMS &quot;Ambush&quot; was reported to be undergoing a period of prolonged maintenance at Faslane, having last been to sea in the autumn of 2022.

<text>HMS &quot;Artful&quot; is the third nuclear-powered fleet submarine of the British Royal Navy. She is the second submarine of the Royal Navy to bear this name. &quot;Artful&quot; was ordered from GEC&#x27;s Marconi Marine (now BAE Systems Submarine Solutions) on 17 March 1997, and was constructed at Barrow in Furness. She was named on 20 September 2013, was rolled out of the shipyard construction hall on 16 May 2014, and was due to start sea trials in early 2015. &quot;Artful&quot; made her first successful basin dive in October 2014, and sailed on 13 August 2015 for sea trials. &quot;Artful&quot; was handed over the Royal Navy on 14 December 2015, and commissioned on 18 March 2016.

==Design==
===Propulsion===
&quot;Artful&quot;″s nuclear reactor will not need to be refuelled during the boat&#x27;s 25-year service. Since the submarine can purify water and air, she will be able to circumnavigate the planet without resurfacing. The main limit is that the submarine will only be able to carry three months&#x27; supply of food for 98 officers and ratings.

===Armament===
&quot;Artful&quot; has provision for up-to 38 weapons in six torpedo tubes. The submarine is capable of using Tomahawk Block IV land-attack missiles with a range of and Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes.

===Common Combat System===
&quot;Artful&quot; is the first &quot;Astute&quot;-class submarine to utilise the Common Combat System, which will be fitted on every &quot;Astute&quot;, &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Dreadnought&quot;-class submarine. The Common Combat System was originally meant to be first tested on the fourth &quot;Astute&quot; boat, , but the system was completed ahead of time.

==Operational history==
In May 2021, &quot;Artful&quot; joined UK Carrier Strike Group 21 on its seven-and-a-half month-long maiden operational deployment to the Far East. 

As of mid-2024, &quot;Artful&quot; had been in a period of prolonged inactivity, having last been to sea in early 2023.

<doc id="491022" wikidata="Q719048" url="?curid=491022" title="Mass in special relativity">
<text>The word &quot;mass&quot; has two meanings in special relativity: &quot;invariant mass&quot; (also called rest mass) is an invariant quantity which is the same for all observers in all reference frames, while the relativistic mass is dependent on the velocity of the observer. According to the concept of mass–energy equivalence, invariant mass is equivalent to &quot;rest energy&quot;, while relativistic mass is equivalent to &quot;relativistic energy&quot; (also called total energy).

The term &quot;relativistic mass&quot; tends not to be used in particle and nuclear physics and is often avoided by writers on special relativity, in favor of referring to the body&#x27;s relativistic energy. In contrast, &quot;invariant mass&quot; is usually preferred over rest energy. The measurable inertia and the warping of spacetime by a body in a given frame of reference is determined by its relativistic mass, not merely its invariant mass. For example, photons have zero rest mass but contribute to the inertia (and weight in a gravitational field) of any system containing them.

The concept is generalized in mass in general relativity.

== Rest mass ==
The term &quot;mass&quot; in special relativity usually refers to the rest mass of the object, which is the Newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object. The &quot;invariant mass&quot; is another name for the &quot;rest mass&quot; of single particles. The more general invariant mass (calculated with a more complicated formula) loosely corresponds to the &quot;rest mass&quot; of a &quot;system&quot;. Thus, invariant mass is a natural unit of mass used for systems which are being viewed from their center of momentum frame (COM frame), as when any closed system (for example a bottle of hot gas) is weighed, which requires that the measurement be taken in the center of momentum frame where the system has no net momentum. Under such circumstances the invariant mass is equal to the relativistic mass (discussed below), which is the total energy of the system divided by &quot;c&quot;2 (the speed of light squared).

The concept of invariant mass does not require bound systems of particles, however. As such, it may also be applied to systems of unbound particles in high-speed relative motion. Because of this, it is often employed in particle physics for systems which consist of widely separated high-energy particles. If such systems were derived from a single particle, then the calculation of the invariant mass of such systems, which is a never-changing quantity, will provide the rest mass of the parent particle (because it is conserved over time).

It is often convenient in calculation that the invariant mass of a system is the total energy of the system (divided by ) in the COM frame (where, by definition, the momentum of the system is zero). However, since the invariant mass of any system is also the same quantity in all inertial frames, it is a quantity often calculated from the total energy in the COM frame, then used to calculate system energies and momenta in other frames where the momenta are not zero, and the system total energy will necessarily be a different quantity than in the COM frame. As with energy and momentum, the invariant mass of a system cannot be destroyed or changed, and it is thus conserved, so long as the system is closed to all influences. (The technical term is isolated system meaning that an idealized boundary is drawn around the system, and no mass/energy is allowed across it.)

== Relativistic mass ==
The &quot;relativistic mass&quot; is the sum total quantity of energy in a body or system (divided by ). Thus, the mass in the formula
formula_1
is the relativistic mass. For a particle of non-zero rest mass moving at a speed formula_2 relative to the observer, one finds
formula_3

In the center of momentum frame, formula_4 and the relativistic mass equals the rest mass. In other frames, the relativistic mass (of a body or system of bodies) includes a contribution from the &quot;net&quot; kinetic energy of the body (the kinetic energy of the center of mass of the body), and is larger the faster the body moves. Thus, unlike the invariant mass, the relativistic mass depends on the observer&#x27;s frame of reference. However, for given single frames of reference and for isolated systems, the relativistic mass is also a conserved quantity. 
The relativistic mass is also the proportionality factor between velocity and momentum,
formula_5

Newton&#x27;s second law remains valid in the form
formula_6

When a body emits light of frequency formula_7 and wavelength formula_8 as a photon of energy formula_9, the mass of the body decreases by formula_10, which some interpret as the relativistic mass of the emitted photon since it also fulfills formula_11. Although some authors present relativistic mass as a &quot;fundamental&quot; concept of the theory, it has been argued that this is wrong as the fundamentals of the theory relate to space–time. There is disagreement over whether the concept is pedagogically useful. It explains simply and quantitatively why a body subject to a constant acceleration cannot reach the speed of light, and why the mass of a system emitting a photon decreases. In relativistic quantum chemistry, relativistic mass is used to explain electron orbital contraction in heavy elements.
The notion of mass as a property of an object from Newtonian mechanics does not bear a precise relationship to the concept in relativity. 
Relativistic mass is not referenced in nuclear and particle physics, and a survey of introductory textbooks in 2005 showed that only 5 of 24 texts used the concept, although it is still prevalent in popularizations.

If a stationary box contains many particles, its weight increases in its rest frame the faster the particles are moving. Any energy in the box (including the kinetic energy of the particles) adds to the mass, so that the relative motion of the particles contributes to the mass of the box. But if the box itself is moving (its center of mass is moving), there remains the question of whether the kinetic energy of the overall motion should be included in the mass of the system. The invariant mass is calculated excluding the kinetic energy of the system as a whole (calculated using the single velocity of the box, which is to say the velocity of the box&#x27;s center of mass), while the relativistic mass is calculated including invariant mass &quot;plus&quot; the kinetic energy of the system which is calculated from the velocity of the center of mass.

== Relativistic vs. rest mass ==
Relativistic mass and rest mass are both traditional concepts in physics, but the relativistic mass corresponds to the total energy. The relativistic mass is the mass of the system as it would be measured on a scale, but in some cases (such as the box above) this fact remains true only because the system on average must be at rest to be weighed (it must have zero net momentum, which is to say, the measurement is in its center of momentum frame). For example, if an electron in a cyclotron is moving in circles with a relativistic velocity, the mass of the cyclotron+electron system is increased by the relativistic mass of the electron, not by the electron&#x27;s rest mass. But the same is also true of any closed system, such as an electron-and-box, if the electron bounces at high speed inside the box. It is only the lack of total momentum in the system (the system momenta sum to zero) which allows the kinetic energy of the electron to be &quot;weighed&quot;. If the electron is &quot;stopped&quot; and weighed, or the scale were somehow sent after it, it would not be moving with respect to the scale, and again the relativistic and rest masses would be the same for the single electron (and would be smaller). In general, relativistic and rest masses are equal only in systems which have no net momentum and the system center of mass is at rest; otherwise they may be different.

The invariant mass is proportional to the value of the total energy in one reference frame, the frame where the object as a whole is at rest (as defined below in terms of center of mass). This is why the invariant mass is the same as the rest mass for single particles. However, the invariant mass also represents the measured mass when the center of mass is at rest for systems of many particles. This special frame where this occurs is also called the center of momentum frame, and is defined as the inertial frame in which the center of mass of the object is at rest (another way of stating this is that it is the frame in which the momenta of the system&#x27;s parts add to zero). For compound objects (made of many smaller objects, some of which may be moving) and sets of unbound objects (some of which may also be moving), only the center of mass of the system is required to be at rest, for the object&#x27;s relativistic mass to be equal to its rest mass.

A so-called massless particle (such as a photon, or a theoretical graviton) moves at the speed of light in every frame of reference. In this case there is no transformation that will bring the particle to rest. The total energy of such particles becomes smaller and smaller in frames which move faster and faster in the same direction. As such, they have no rest mass, because they can never be measured in a frame where they are at rest. This property of having no rest mass is what causes these particles to be termed &quot;massless&quot;. However, even massless particles have a relativistic mass, which varies with their observed energy in various frames of reference.

==Invariant mass==

The invariant mass is the ratio of four-momentum (the four-dimensional generalization of classical momentum) to four-velocity:
formula_12
and is also the ratio of four-acceleration to four-force when the rest mass is constant. The four-dimensional form of Newton&#x27;s second law is:
formula_13

==Relativistic energy–momentum equation==
The relativistic expressions for and obey the relativistic energy–momentum relation:
formula_14
where the m is the rest mass, or the invariant mass for systems, and is the total energy.

The equation is also valid for photons, which have :
formula_15
and therefore
formula_16

A photon&#x27;s momentum is a function of its energy, but it is not proportional to the velocity, which is always .

For an object at rest, the momentum is zero, therefore
formula_17 Note that the formula is true only for particles or systems with zero momentum.

The rest mass is only proportional to the total energy in the rest frame of the object.

When the object is moving, the total energy is given by
formula_18

To find the form of the momentum and energy as a function of velocity, it can be noted that the four-velocity, which is proportional to formula_19, is the only four-vector associated with the particle&#x27;s motion, so that if there is a conserved four-momentum formula_20, it must be proportional to this vector. This allows expressing the ratio of energy to momentum as
formula_21
resulting in a relation between and :
formula_22

This results in 
formula_23
and
formula_24

these expressions can be written as
formula_25
where the factor formula_26

When working in units where , known as the natural unit system, all the relativistic equations are simplified and the quantities energy, momentum, and mass have the same natural dimension:

formula_27

The equation is often written this way because the difference formula_28 is the relativistic length of the energy momentum four-vector, a length which is associated with rest mass or invariant mass in systems. Where and , this equation again expresses the mass–energy equivalence .

== The mass of composite systems ==

The rest mass of a composite system is not the sum of the rest masses of the parts, unless all the parts are at rest. The total mass of a composite system includes the kinetic energy and field energy in the system.

The total energy of a composite system can be determined by adding together the sum of the energies of its components. The total momentum formula_29 of the system, a vector quantity, can also be computed by adding together the momenta of all its components. Given the total energy and the length (magnitude) of the total momentum vector formula_29, the invariant mass is given by:
formula_31

In the system of natural units where , for systems of particles (whether bound or unbound) the total system invariant mass is given equivalently by the following:
formula_32

Where, again, the particle momenta formula_29 are first summed as vectors, and then the square of their resulting total magnitude (Euclidean norm) is used. This results in a scalar number, which is subtracted from the scalar value of the square of the total energy.

For such a system, in the special center of momentum frame where momenta sum to zero, again the system mass (called the invariant mass) corresponds to the total system energy or, in units where , is identical to it. This invariant mass for a system remains the same quantity in any inertial frame, although the system total energy and total momentum are functions of the particular inertial frame which is chosen, and will vary in such a way between inertial frames as to keep the invariant mass the same for all observers. Invariant mass thus functions for systems of particles in the same capacity as &quot;rest mass&quot; does for single particles.

Note that the invariant mass of an isolated system (i.e., one closed to both mass and energy) is also independent of observer or inertial frame, and is a constant, conserved quantity for isolated systems and single observers, even during chemical and nuclear reactions. The concept of invariant mass is widely used in particle physics, because the invariant mass of a particle&#x27;s decay products is equal to its rest mass. This is used to make measurements of the mass of particles like the Z boson or the top quark.

==Conservation versus invariance of mass in special relativity==

Total energy is an additive conserved quantity (for single observers) in systems and in reactions between particles, but rest mass (in the sense of being a sum of particle rest masses) may not be conserved through an event in which rest masses of particles are converted to other types of energy, such as kinetic energy. Finding the sum of individual particle rest masses would require multiple observers, one for each particle rest inertial frame, and these observers ignore individual particle kinetic energy. Conservation laws require a single observer and a single inertial frame.

In general, for isolated systems and single observers, relativistic mass is conserved (each observer sees it constant over time), but is not invariant (that is, different observers see different values). Invariant mass, however, is both conserved &quot;and&quot; invariant (all single observers see the same value, which does not change over time).

The relativistic mass corresponds to the energy, so conservation of energy automatically means that relativistic mass is conserved for any given observer and inertial frame. However, this quantity, like the total energy of a particle, is not invariant. This means that, even though it is conserved for any observer during a reaction, its absolute &quot;value&quot; will change with the frame of the observer, and for different observers in different frames.

By contrast, the rest mass and invariant masses of systems and particles are conserved also invariant. For example: A closed container of gas (closed to energy as well) has a system &quot;rest mass&quot; in the sense that it can be weighed on a resting scale, even while it contains moving components. This mass is the invariant mass, which is equal to the total relativistic energy of the container (including the kinetic energy of the gas) only when it is measured in the center of momentum frame. Just as is the case for single particles, the calculated &quot;rest mass&quot; of such a container of gas does not change when it is in motion, although its &quot;relativistic mass&quot; does change.

The container may even be subjected to a force which gives it an overall velocity, or else (equivalently) it may be viewed from an inertial frame in which it has an overall velocity (that is, technically, a frame in which its center of mass has a velocity). In this case, its total relativistic mass and energy increase. However, in such a situation, although the container&#x27;s total relativistic energy and total momentum increase, these energy and momentum increases subtract out in the &quot;invariant mass&quot; definition, so that the moving container&#x27;s invariant mass will be calculated as the same value as if it were measured at rest, on a scale.

===Closed systems===

All conservation laws in special relativity (for energy, mass, and momentum) require isolated systems, meaning systems that are totally isolated, with no mass–energy allowed in or out, over time. If a system is isolated, then both total energy and total momentum in the system are conserved over time for any observer in any single inertial frame, though their &quot;absolute values&quot; will vary, according to different observers in different inertial frames. The invariant mass of the system is also conserved, but does &quot;not&quot; change with different observers. This is also the familiar situation with single particles: all observers calculate &quot;the same&quot; particle rest mass (a special case of the invariant mass) no matter how they move (what inertial frame they choose), but different observers see different total energies and momenta for the same particle.

Conservation of invariant mass also requires the system to be enclosed so that no heat and radiation (and thus invariant mass) can escape. As in the example above, a physically enclosed or bound system does not need to be completely isolated from external forces for its mass to remain constant, because for bound systems these merely act to change the inertial frame of the system or the observer. Though such actions may change the total energy or momentum of the bound system, these two changes cancel, so that there is no change in the system&#x27;s invariant mass. This is just the same result as with single particles: their calculated rest mass also remains constant no matter how fast they move, or how fast an observer sees them move.

On the other hand, for systems which are unbound, the &quot;closure&quot; of the system may be enforced by an idealized surface, inasmuch as no mass–energy can be allowed into or out of the test-volume over time, if conservation of system invariant mass is to hold during that time. If a force is allowed to act on (do work on) only one part of such an unbound system, this is equivalent to allowing energy into or out of the system, and the condition of &quot;closure&quot; to mass–energy (total isolation) is violated. In this case, conservation of invariant mass of the system also will no longer hold. Such a loss of rest mass in systems when energy is removed, according to where is the energy removed, and is the change in rest mass, reflect changes of mass associated with movement of energy, not &quot;conversion&quot; of mass to energy.

===The system invariant mass vs. the individual rest masses of parts of the system===

Again, in special relativity, the rest mass of a system is not required to be equal to the sum of the rest masses of the parts (a situation which would be analogous to gross mass-conservation in chemistry). For example, a massive particle can decay into photons which individually have no mass, but which (as a system) preserve the invariant mass of the particle which produced them. Also a box of moving non-interacting particles (e.g., photons, or an ideal gas) will have a larger invariant mass than the sum of the rest masses of the particles which compose it. This is because the total energy of all particles and fields in a system must be summed, and this quantity, as seen in the center of momentum frame, and divided by , is the system&#x27;s invariant mass.

In special relativity, mass is not &quot;converted&quot; to energy, for all types of energy still retain their associated mass. Neither energy nor invariant mass can be destroyed in special relativity, and each is separately conserved over time in closed systems. Thus, a system&#x27;s invariant mass may change &quot;only&quot; because invariant mass is allowed to escape, perhaps as light or heat. Thus, when reactions (whether chemical or nuclear) release energy in the form of heat and light, if the heat and light is &quot;not&quot; allowed to escape (the system is closed and isolated), the energy will continue to contribute to the system rest mass, and the system mass will not change. Only if the energy is released to the environment will the mass be lost; this is because the associated mass has been allowed out of the system, where it contributes to the mass of the surroundings.

==History of the relativistic mass concept==

===Transverse and longitudinal mass ===

Concepts that were similar to what nowadays is called &quot;relativistic mass&quot;, were already developed before the advent of special relativity. For example, it was recognized by J. J. Thomson in 1881 that a charged body is harder to set in motion than an uncharged body, which was worked out in more detail by Oliver Heaviside (1889) and George Frederick Charles Searle (1897). So the electrostatic energy behaves as having some sort of electromagnetic mass formula_34, which can increase the normal mechanical mass of the bodies.

Then, it was pointed out by Thomson and Searle that this electromagnetic mass also increases with velocity. This was further elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz (1899, 1904) in the framework of Lorentz ether theory. He defined mass as the ratio of force to acceleration, not as the ratio of momentum to velocity, so he needed to distinguish between the mass formula_35 parallel to the direction of motion and the mass formula_36 perpendicular to the direction of motion (where formula_37 is the Lorentz factor, is the relative velocity between the ether and the object, and is the speed of light). Only when the force is perpendicular to the velocity, Lorentz&#x27;s mass is equal to what is now called &quot;relativistic mass&quot;. Max Abraham (1902) called formula_38 &quot;longitudinal mass&quot; and formula_39 &quot;transverse mass&quot; (although Abraham used more complicated expressions than Lorentz&#x27;s relativistic ones). So, according to Lorentz&#x27;s theory no body can reach the speed of light because the mass becomes infinitely large at this velocity.

Albert Einstein also initially used the concepts of longitudinal and transverse mass in his 1905 electrodynamics paper (equivalent to those of Lorentz, but with a different formula_39 by an unfortunate force definition, which was later corrected), and in another paper in 1906. However, he later abandoned velocity dependent mass concepts (see quote at the end of next section).

The precise relativistic expression (which is equivalent to Lorentz&#x27;s) relating force and acceleration for a particle with non-zero rest mass formula_41 moving in the &quot;x&quot; direction with velocity &quot;v&quot; and associated Lorentz factor formula_42 is
formula_43

===Relativistic mass===
In special relativity, an object that has nonzero rest mass cannot travel at the speed of light. As the object approaches the speed of light, the object&#x27;s energy and momentum increase without bound.

In the first years after 1905, following Lorentz and Einstein, the terms longitudinal and transverse mass were still in use. However, those expressions were replaced by the concept of &quot;relativistic mass&quot;, an expression which was first defined by Gilbert N. Lewis and Richard C. Tolman in 1909. They defined the total energy and mass of a body as
formula_44
and of a body at rest
formula_45
with the ratio
formula_46

Tolman in 1912 further elaborated on this concept, and stated: &quot;the expression &quot;m&quot;0(1 − &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot;)−1/2 is best suited for the mass of a moving body.&quot;

In 1934, Tolman argued that the relativistic mass formula formula_47 holds for all particles, including those moving at the speed of light, while the formula formula_48 only applies to a slower-than-light particle (a particle with a nonzero rest mass). Tolman remarked on this relation that &quot;We have, moreover, of course the experimental verification of the expression in the case of moving electrons ... We shall hence have no hesitation in accepting the expression as correct in general for the mass of a moving particle.&quot;

When the relative velocity is zero, formula_42 is simply equal to 1, and the relativistic mass is reduced to the rest mass as one can see in the next two equations below. As the velocity increases toward the speed of light &quot;c&quot;, the denominator of the right side approaches zero, and consequently formula_42 approaches infinity. While Newton&#x27;s second law remains valid in the form
formula_51
the derived form formula_52 is not valid because formula_53 in formula_54 is generally not a constant (see the section above on transverse and longitudinal mass).

Even though Einstein initially used the expressions &quot;longitudinal&quot; and &quot;transverse&quot; mass in two papers (see previous section), in his first paper on formula_55 (1905) he treated as what would now be called the &quot;rest mass&quot;. Einstein never derived an equation for &quot;relativistic mass&quot;, and in later years he expressed his dislike of the idea:
===Popular science and textbooks===
The concept of relativistic mass is widely used in popular science writing and in high school and undergraduate textbooks. Authors such as Okun and A. B. Arons have argued against this as archaic and confusing, and not in accord with modern relativistic theory.
Arons wrote:
For many years it was conventional to enter the discussion of dynamics through derivation of the relativistic mass, that is the mass–velocity relation, and this is probably still the dominant mode in textbooks. More recently, however, it has been increasingly recognized that relativistic mass is a troublesome and dubious concept. [See, for example, Okun (1989).]... The sound and rigorous approach to relativistic dynamics is through direct development of that expression for &quot;momentum&quot; that ensures conservation of momentum in all frames: formula_56 rather than through relativistic mass.

C. Alder takes a similarly dismissive stance on mass in relativity. Writing on said subject matter, he says that &quot;its introduction into the theory of special relativity was much in the way of a historical accident&quot;, noting towards the widespread knowledge of and how the public&#x27;s interpretation of the equation has largely informed how it is taught in higher education. He instead supposes that the difference between rest and relativistic mass should be explicitly taught, so that students know why mass should be thought of as invariant &quot;in most discussions of inertia&quot;.

Many contemporary authors such as Taylor and Wheeler avoid using the concept of relativistic mass altogether:
While spacetime has the unbounded geometry of Minkowski space, the velocity-space is bounded by and has the geometry of hyperbolic geometry where relativistic mass plays an analogous role to that of Newtonian mass in the barycentric coordinates of Euclidean geometry. The connection of velocity to hyperbolic geometry enables the 3-velocity-dependent relativistic mass to be related to the 4-velocity Minkowski formalism.

<text>Valenciennes (, also , , ; ; or ; ) is a commune in the Nord department, Hauts-de-France, France.

It lies on the Scheldt () river. Although the city and region experienced a steady population decline between 1975 and 1990, it has since rebounded.

==History==

===Before 1500===
Valenciennes is first mentioned in 693 in a legal document written by Clovis II (&quot;Valentiana&quot;). In the 843 Treaty of Verdun, it was made a neutral city between Neustria and the Austrasia. Later in the 9th century the region was overrun by the Normans, and in 881 the town passed to them. In 923, it passed to the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia dependent on the Holy Roman Empire. Once the Empire of the Franks was established, the city began to develop, though the archaeological record has still not revealed all it has to reveal about this period.

In 1008, a terrible famine brought the Plague. According to the local tradition, the Virgin Mary held a cordon around the city which, miraculously, has since protected its people from the disease. Since then, every year at that time, the Valenciennois used to walk around the road round the town, in what is called the tour of the Holy Cordon.

In 1259, Valenciennes was the site of a General Chapter of the Dominican Order at which Thomas Aquinas together with masters Bonushomo Britto, Florentius, Albert, and Peter took part in establishing a &quot;ratio studiorum&quot; or program of studies for the Dominican Order that featured the study of philosophy as an innovation for those not sufficiently trained to study theology. This innovation initiated the tradition of Dominican scholastic philosophy put into practice, for example, in 1265 at the Order&#x27;s &quot;studium provinciale&quot; at the convent of Santa Sabina in Rome, out of which would develop the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;.

===1500–1793===

In 1524, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, arrived at Valenciennes, and – even when Henry II of France allied with him against the Protestants in 1552 – Valenciennes became () an early center of Calvinism and in 1562 was location of the first act of resistance against persecution of Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands. On the &quot;Journée des Mals Brûlés&quot; (Bad Burnings Day) in 1562, a mob freed some Protestants condemned to die at the stake. In the wave of iconoclastic attacks called the &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot; that swept the Habsburg Netherlands in the summer of 1566, the city was the furthest south to see such an attack on August 24, 1566. It was also one of the first to feel the hand of repression after the siege and fall of the city on March 23, 1567. One of the victims of that repression was Guido de Bres, the author of the Belgic Confession. Following the &quot;révolte des gueux&#x27;s victory at Brielle, the army of Louis of Nassau, one of the major commanders of the Dutch rebel forces and supported by the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, invaded the Spanish Netherlands with an army composed of German, English, Scottish and French soldiers, and took Valenciennes on 21 May 1572. However, Louis went on to Mons, and the 
Protestant garrison left behind offered only a feeble defence to the Duke of Alba, at the head of the bulk of the Spanish army, who recaptured Valenciennes in early June 1572, depriving Louis&#x27; French allies, of one of their main bases.

The French army laid siege to the city in 1656 (Vauban participated in this siege without a command). Defending the city, Albert de Merode, marquis de Trélon was injured during a sortie on horseback, died as a result of his injuries and was buried in the Church of St. Paul (his tomb was found during the archaeological campaign in 1990).

In 1677, the armies of Louis XIV of France (this time led by Vauban) captured the city and in 1678 the Treaty of Nijmegen gave the French control of Valenciennes (1678) and the surrounding southern part of Hainault, roughly cutting the former county in half.

===1793–1914===

The city was besieged by the First Coalition against Revolutionary France in 1793. Following a protracted Siege of Valenciennes the city was captured and occupied in July by Anglo-Austrian forces under the Duke of York and the Prince of Saxe-Coburg, and only retaken by the French Revolutionary armies in August 1794. In July 1795, one year after the execution of Robespierre put an end to the Reign of Terror, the Republicans of Valenciennes tortured, and guillotined five Ursuline nuns; by some accounts, the nuns were raped before being executed. After the Napoleonic era, Valenciennes gave itself up to the Bourbons in 1815 for 5 years.

===First World War===
During World War I the German army occupied the town in 1914. They were finally driven out by British forces at the Battle of Valenciennes in 1918, &#x27;in which seven British divisions attacked eleven German divisions&#x27;. One dramatic first-hand experience of this battle is provided by A. S. Bullock who fought at a section of the front near Maresches.

===1945 to present===
The town&#x27;s first antenna was set up in Lille in 1964, then the Centre universitaire was set up in 1970, becoming independent in 1979 as the University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambrésis.

In 2005, a local resident, Isabelle Dinoire, became the first person to have a partial face transplant.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Valenciennes has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Valenciennes is . The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Valenciennes was on 25 July 2019; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 7 January 2009.

==Population==

==Main sights==
The Hindenburg Line ran through Valenciennes during World War I, leading to extensive destruction. Valenciennes was again almost completely destroyed during World War II, and has since been rebuilt in concrete.

A few surviving monuments are: 1) The façade of the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall), which managed to survive the bombardments of the war; 2) the Basilica of Notre-Dame du Saint-Cordon, to which there is an annual pilgrimage; 3) La Maison Espagnole, the remains of the Spanish occupation, which ended in 1678. The building is now used as the town&#x27;s tourist information office; 4) The Dodenne Tower, the remaining part of the medieval fortifications after Charles V ordered them reduced; 5) Théâtre le Phenix, a theatre and performing arts venue constructed in 1998; 6) The &quot;Beffroi&quot;, a large, pin-like monument in height, built in 2007 on the site of the former belfry.


==Economy==

Valenciennes is historically renowned for its lace. Until the 1970s, the main industries were steel and textiles. Since their decline, reconversion attempts focus mainly on automobile production. In 2001, Toyota built its Western European assembly line for the Toyota Yaris in Onnaing near Valenciennes. Because of this and other changes, the average unemployment in the region is now below the national average.

On 15 July 2004, the Administrative Board of the European Union&#x27;s Railway Agency held its first meeting in Phénix, with representatives of the 25 Member States and François Lamoureux, those days Director General for Energy and Transportation at the European Commission. Valenciennes was picked as the European Railway Agency headquarters in December 2003. International conferences are held in Lille.

==Public transport==

Line No. 1 of the Tramway de Valenciennes was put into service on 3 July 2006. long, this tramway crosses the five communes in the Valenciennois Metropolitan area, at a cost of 242.75 million Euros.

Valenciennes railway station offers connections with Lille, Paris and several regional destinations.

==Administration==
Valenciennes is a subprefecture of the Nord &quot;département&quot;.

<text>Giacomo Matteotti (; 22 May 1885 – 10 June 1924) was an Italian socialist politician and secretary of the Unitary Socialist Party (PSU). He was elected deputy of the Chamber of Deputies three times, in 1919, 1921 and in 1924. On 30 May 1924, he openly spoke in the Italian Parliament alleging the fascists committed fraud in the 1924 general election, and denounced the violence they used to gain votes. Eleven days later, he was kidnapped and killed by the secret political police of Benito Mussolini.

==Early life and education==
Matteotti was born in 1885 into a wealthy family, in Fratta Polesine, Province of Rovigo in Veneto. 

He graduated in law at the University of Bologna. An atheist and from early on an activist in the socialist movement and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), he opposed Italy&#x27;s entry into World War I and was interned in Sicily during the conflict for this reason.

==Political career==
He was elected deputy of the Chamber of Deputies three times, in 1919, 1921 and in 1924.

As a follower of Filippo Turati, Matteotti became the leader of the reformist Unitary Socialist Party (PSU) in the Italian Chamber of Deputies after a split from the more radical Italian Socialist Party.

===Opposition to Fascism===

Matteotti openly spoke out against Fascism and Benito Mussolini, and for a time was the leader of the opposition to the National Fascist Party (NFP). In 1921 he denounced fascist violence in a pamphlet titled &quot;Inchiesta socialista sulle gesta dei fascisti in Italia&quot; (&quot;Socialist enquiry on the deeds of the fascists in Italy&quot;).

A year before being killed, &quot;a clear warning against him had appeared in the pages of the newspaper founded by Mussolini himself, &quot;Il popolo d’Italia&quot;&quot;.

In 1924 his book &quot;The Fascisti Exposed: A Year of Fascist Domination&quot; was published and he made two impassioned and lengthy speeches in the Chamber of Deputies denouncing Fascism and declaring that the last election, marked by intimidation and militia violence, was &quot;invalid&quot;.

In the speech Matteotti gave on 30 May 1924 in Parliament, he strongly contested the violence, saying: &quot;In Naples in one conference that the head of the constitutional opposition was to hold, he was prevented due to the mobilization of the armed corps, which intervened in the city&quot;, as a fraud in the 1924 elections (however won by PNF thanks to the Acerbo Law, which put in place an electoral system that guaranteed a majority to the Fascists). According to some theories, this speech was not the only cause of his murder. In fact, according to Renzo De Felice&#x27;s essay &quot;Breve Storia del Fascismo&quot;, Matteotti publicly condemned the alliance of the socialist trade unions and the fascist counterpart. Moreover, he may have found evidence of bribes from Sinclair Oil in favour of Mussolini, in order to get permission for Sinclair&#x27;s exploitation of petroleum reservoirs under Italian control and was deemed dangerous by Mussolini for his links to the British Labour Party.

==Personal life==
In 1912 he met Velia Titta, younger sister of the famous baritone Ruffo Titta, and they married in a civil ceremony in 1916. They had three children: Giancarlo (1918–2006), Matteo (1921–2000) and Isabella (1922–1994).

After Matteotti&#x27;s assassination in 1924, his wife Velia was under house arrest until September 1933, but her heart and her health was broken and she died the following year. Several people who helped her, such as Carlo Rosselli, were also imprisoned. Matteotti&#x27;s son Gianmatteo (also known as Matteo), became a Social Democratic parliamentary deputy after World War II, serving as Italy&#x27;s Minister of Tourism in 1970–72 and Minister of Foreign Trade from 1972–1974.

==Kidnapping and death==
On 1 June 1924, the police chief Emilio De Bono ordered Otto Thierschädl, the spotter of the assassination squad, to be released from prison with a telegram signed &quot;for the minister&quot; of the interior: actually, the Minister of the interior, &quot;ad interim&quot;, was Prime Minister Benito Mussolini.

On 10 June 1924, Matteotti was bundled into a Lancia Kappa by five men while he was walking to Parliament to work. They were Amerigo Dumini, Albino Volpi, Giuseppe Viola, Amleto Poveromo and Augusto Malacria, all acting as members of Mussolini&#x27;s secret political police. Inside the car, he was stabbed several times with a carpenter&#x27;s file as he struggled to escape. His corpse was found after an extensive search near Riano, 23 kilometres north of Rome, on 16 August 1924.

==Consequences of the murder==
The death of Matteotti sparked widespread criticism of Fascism and of the Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. In the days following Matteotti&#x27;s disappearance, it became clear Matteotti had been assassinated on the order of people at the top of the regime, prompting the outrage of the opposition. Within a fortnight since the murder, the judge appointed to investigate the crime had ordered the arrest of high-profile members of Mussolini&#x27;s inner circle and questions were asked about Mussolini&#x27;s personal involvement.

In those weeks &quot;Fascism fielded an articulated series of misdirections, obstructions of justice and red herrings, to declare the moral question closed&quot;. After a few weeks of confusion, Mussolini gained a favourable vote from the Senate of the Kingdom.

All opposition parties then united to agree to abandon Parliamentary proceedings until the government had clarified what had happened to Matteotti in what became known as the Aventino Secession. This was an attempt to give strength to the &quot;moral question&quot; that would point to public disapproval of fascism but also to put pressure on the King to dismiss Mussolini. 

However, Victor Emmanuel III refused to act, since the Government was supported by a large majority of the Chamber of Deputies and almost all the Senate of the Kingdom. Moreover, he feared that compelling Mussolini to resign could be considered a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, that eventually could lead to a civil war between the Army and the Blackshirts.

But during the summer, the trial against Matteotti&#x27;s alleged murderers and the discovery of the corpse of Matteotti once again spread rage against Mussolini – newspapers launched fierce attacks against him and the fascist movement.

On 13 September, a right-wing fascist deputy, Armando Casalini, was killed on a tramway in retaliation for Matteotti&#x27;s murder by the anti-fascist Giovanni Corvi.

During the autumn of 1924, the extremist wing of the Fascist Party threatened Mussolini with a coup and dealt with him on the night of San Silvestro in 1924. Mussolini devised a counter-manoeuvre, and on 3 January 1925, he gave a famous speech both attacking anti-fascists and confirming that he, and only he, was the leader of Fascism. He challenged the anti-fascists to prosecute him and claimed proudly that Fascism was the &quot;superb passion of the best youth of Italy&quot; and grimly that &quot;all the violence&quot; was his responsibility because he had created the climate of violence. Admitting that the murderers were Fascists of &quot;high station&quot;, as Hitler later did after the Night of the Long Knives, Mussolini rhetorically claimed fault, stating &quot;I assume, I alone, the political, moral, historical responsibility for everything that has happened. If sentences, more or less maimed, are enough to hang a man, out with the noose!&quot; Mussolini concluded with a warning: Italy needs stability and Fascism would assure stability to Italy in any manner necessary.

This speech is considered the very beginning of the dictatorship in Italy.

===Trials against his murderers===
Five men (Amerigo Dumini, the operational leader of the &quot;Ceka&quot;, the Fascist secret police; Giuseppe Viola, Albino Volpi, Augusto Malacria, and Amleto Poveromo) were arrested a few days after the kidnapping. Another suspect, Filippo Panzeri, fled from arrest. Only three men (Dumini, Volpi and Poveromo) were convicted and shortly after released under amnesty by King Victor Emmanuel III.

Before the trial against the murderers, the High Court of the Senate started a trial against general Emilio De Bono, commander of the Fascist paramilitary Blackshirts (MVSN), but he was discharged.

After the Second World War, in 1947, the trial against Francesco Giunta, Cesare Rossi, Dumini, Viola, Poveromo, Malacria, Filippelli and Panzeri was re-opened. Dumini, Viola and Poveromo were sentenced to life imprisonment.

In none of these three trials was evidence declared of Mussolini&#x27;s involvement, due to trial extinction for the death of the defendant.

===Mussolini&#x27;s alleged involvement===
The involvement of Benito Mussolini in the assassination is much debated. Historians have suggested different theories over the years. 

The first important biographer of Mussolini, Renzo De Felice, was convinced that the Duce was innocent. Aiding him were Aurelio Lepre and Emilio Gentile, who also believed in the Duce&#x27;s innocence. However, De Felice did not have a chance to study many documents pertaining to the inquest over the murder which were not easily available at the time of his research. 

The former socialist and anti-fascist journalist Carlo Silvestri in 1924 was a harsh accuser of Mussolini; later, when he joined the Italian Social Republic, he affirmed that Mussolini had shown him the papers for the Matteotti case, and eventually he changed his mind. Silvestri became a strong defender of Mussolini&#x27;s innocence in Matteotti&#x27;s murder and suggested that the socialist was killed by a plot, in order both to damage Mussolini&#x27;s attempt to raise a leftist government (with the participation of Socialists and &quot;Popolari&quot;) and to cover some scandals in which the Crown (with the American oil company Sinclair Oil) was involved.

De Felice argued that maybe Mussolini himself was a political victim of a plot, and almost surely he was damaged by the crisis that followed the murder. Many fascists left the Party, and his government was about to collapse. Moreover, his secret attempt to bring Socialists and &quot;Popolari&quot; into a new reformist government was ruined.

John Gunther wrote in 1940 that &quot;Most critics nowadays do not think that the Duce directly ordered the assassination ... but his moral responsibility is indisputable&quot;, perhaps with underlings believing they were carrying out Mussolini&#x27;s desire by performing the kidnapping and murder on their own. Other historians, including Justin Pollard and Denis Mack Smith, thought Mussolini was probably aware of the assassination plot but that it was ordered and organized by someone else.

Mauro Canali suggested in 1997 that Mussolini probably did order the murder, as Matteotti uncovered and wanted to make public incriminating documents proving that Mussolini and his associates sold Sinclair Oil Corporation exclusive rights to all Italian oil reserves. Judge Giovanni Spagnuolo, in relation to the &quot;business clue&quot; linked to the Sinclair Oil agreement, added in his 1946 indictment - refuting it in detail - that this &quot;hypothesis clashes with the most elementary logic&quot;. Whether or not the motive of the murder was linked to this corruption case, many scholars now believe Mussolini did order the murder which was planned and executed by his political police, called Ceka. 

In May 2024, Giorgia Meloni said in the 100 year anniversary of his death, that Italian fascists committed fraud in the 1924 Italian general election, and killed Matteotti. but she fell short of naming Mussolini as the instigator of the crime, nor did she blame the fascist regime for it.

==Legacy==
Numerous monuments to Matteotti have been established, including a Monument in Rome along Lungotevere Arnaldo da Brescia, where the kidnap-murder took place.

In Florestano Vancini&#x27;s film &quot;The Assassination of Matteotti&quot; (1973), Matteotti is played by Franco Nero.

<text>The Rule 110 cellular automaton (often called simply Rule 110) is an elementary cellular automaton with interesting behavior on the boundary between stability and chaos. In this respect, it is similar to Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. Like Life, Rule 110 with a particular repeating background pattern is known to be Turing complete. This implies that, in principle, any calculation or computer program can be simulated using this automaton.
==Definition==
In an elementary cellular automaton, a one-dimensional pattern of 0s and 1s evolves according to a simple set of rules. Whether a point in the pattern will be 0 or 1 in the new generation depends on its current value, as well as on those of its two neighbors.

The Rule 110 automaton has the following set of rules:

The name &quot;Rule 110&quot; derives from the fact that this rule can be summarized in the binary sequence 01101110; interpreted as a binary number, this corresponds to the decimal value 110. This is the Wolfram code naming scheme.

==History==
In 2004, Matthew Cook published a proof that Rule 110 with a particular repeating background pattern is Turing complete, i.e., capable of universal computation, which Stephen Wolfram had conjectured in 1985. Cook presented his proof at the Santa Fe Institute conference CA98 before publication of Wolfram&#x27;s book &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;. This resulted in a legal affair based on a non-disclosure agreement with Wolfram Research. Wolfram Research blocked publication of Cook&#x27;s proof for several years.

==Interesting properties==
Among the 88 possible unique elementary cellular automata, Rule 110 is the only one for which Turing completeness has been directly proven, although proofs for several similar rules follow as simple corollaries (e.g. Rule 124, which is the horizontal reflection of Rule 110). Rule 110 is arguably the simplest known Turing complete system.

Rule 110, like the Game of Life, exhibits what Wolfram calls &quot;Class 4 behavior&quot;, which is neither completely stable nor completely chaotic. Localized structures appear and interact in complex ways.

Matthew Cook proved Rule 110 capable of supporting universal computation by successively emulating cyclic tag systems, then 2-tag system, and then Turing machines. The final stage has exponential time overhead because the Turing machine&#x27;s tape is encoded with a unary numeral system. Neary and Woods (2006) presented a different construction that replaces 2-tag systems with clockwise Turing machines and has polynomial overhead.

==The proof of universality==
Matthew Cook presented his proof of the universality of Rule 110 at a Santa Fe Institute conference, held before the publication of &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;. Wolfram Research claimed that this presentation violated Cook&#x27;s nondisclosure agreement with his employer, and obtained a court order excluding Cook&#x27;s paper from the published conference proceedings. The existence of Cook&#x27;s proof nevertheless became known. Interest in his proof stemmed not so much from its result as from its methods, specifically from the technical details of its construction. The character of Cook&#x27;s proof differs considerably from the discussion of Rule 110 in &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;. Cook has since written a paper setting out his complete proof.

Cook proved that Rule 110 was universal (or Turing complete) by showing it was possible to use the rule to emulate another computational model, the cyclic tag system, which is known to be universal. He first isolated a number of spaceships, self-perpetuating localized patterns, that could be constructed on an infinitely repeating pattern in a Rule 110 universe. He then devised a way for combinations of these structures to interact in a manner that could be exploited for computation.

===Spaceships in Rule 110===
The function of the universal machine in Rule 110 requires a finite number of localized patterns to be embedded within an infinitely repeating background pattern. The background pattern is fourteen cells wide and repeats itself exactly every seven iterations. The pattern is 00010011011111.

Three localized patterns are of particular importance in the Rule 110 universal machine. They are shown in the image below, surrounded by the repeating background pattern. The leftmost structure shifts to the right two cells and repeats every three generations. It comprises the sequence 0001110111 surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as two different evolutions of this sequence.

In the figures, time elapses from top to bottom: the top line represents the initial state, and each following line the state at the next time.

The center structure shifts left eight cells and repeats every thirty generations. It comprises the sequence 1001111 surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as twenty-nine different evolutions of this sequence.

The rightmost structure remains stationary and repeats every seven generations. It comprises the sequence 111 surrounded by the background pattern given above, as well as five different evolutions of this sequence.

Below is an image showing the first two structures passing through each other without interacting other than by translation (left), and interacting to form the third structure (right).

There are numerous other spaceships in Rule 110, but they do not feature as prominently in the universality proof.

===Constructing the cyclic tag system===

The cyclic tag system machinery has three main components:
* A &quot;data string&quot; which is stationary;
* An infinitely repeating series of finite &quot;production rules&quot; which start on the right and move leftward;
* An infinitely repeating series of &quot;clock pulses&quot; which start on the left and move rightward.

The initial spacing between these components is of utmost importance. In order for the cellular automaton to implement the cyclic tag system, the automaton&#x27;s initial conditions must be carefully selected so that the various localized structures contained therein interact in a highly ordered way.

The &quot;data string&quot; in the cyclic tag system is represented by a series of stationary repeating structures of the type shown above. Varying amounts of horizontal space between these structures serve to differentiate 1 symbols from 0 symbols. These symbols represent the &quot;word&quot; on which the cyclic tag system is operating, and the first such symbol is destroyed upon consideration of every production rule. When this leading symbol is a 1, new symbols are added to the end of the string; when it is 0, no new symbols are added. The mechanism for achieving this is described below.

Entering from the right are a series of left-moving structures of the type shown above, separated by varying amounts of horizontal space. Large numbers of these structures are combined with different spacings to represent 0s and 1s in the cyclic tag system&#x27;s production rules. Because the tag system&#x27;s production rules are known at the time of creation of the program, and infinitely repeating, the patterns of 0s and 1s at the initial condition can be represented by an infinitely repeating string. Each production rule is separated from the next by another structure known as a &quot;rule separator&quot; (or &quot;block separator&quot;), which moves towards the left at the same rate as the encoding of the production rules.

When a left-moving rule separator encounters a stationary symbol in the cyclic tag system&#x27;s data string, it causes the first symbol it encounters to be destroyed. However, its subsequent behavior varies depending on whether the symbol encoded by the string had been a 0 or a 1. If a 0, the rule separator changes into a new structure which blocks the incoming production rule. This new structure is destroyed when it encounters the next rule separator.

If, on the other hand, the symbol in the string was a 1, the rule separator changes into a new structure which admits the incoming production rule. Although the new structure is again destroyed when it encounters the next rule separator, it first allows a series of structures to pass through towards the left. These structures are then made to append themselves to the end of the cyclic tag system&#x27;s data string. This final transformation is accomplished by means of a series of infinitely repeating, right-moving &quot;clock pulses&quot; in the right-moving pattern shown above. The clock pulses transform incoming left-moving 1 symbols from a production rule into stationary 1 symbols of the data string, and incoming 0 symbols from a production rule into stationary 0 symbols of the data string.

<text>Johannes Valentinus Andreae (17 August 1586 – 27 June 1654), a.k.a. Johannes Valentinus Andreä or Johann Valentin Andreae, was a German theologian, who claimed to be the author of an ancient text known as the &quot;Chymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosencreutz anno 1459&quot; (published in 1616, Strasbourg; in English &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz in 1459&quot;). This became one of the three founding works of Rosicrucianism, which was both a legend and a fashionable cultural phenomenon across Europe in this period.

Andreae was a prominent member of the Protestant utopian movement which began in Germany and spread across northern Europe and into Britain under the mentorship of Samuel Hartlib and John Amos Comenius. The focus of this movement was the need for education and the encouragement of sciences as the key to national prosperity. But like many vaguely-religious Renaissance movements at this time, the scientific ideas being promoted were often tinged with hermeticism, occultism and neo-Platonic concepts. The threats of heresy charges posed by rigid religious authorities (Protestant and Catholic) and a scholastic intellectual climate often forced these activists to hide behind fictional secret societies and write anonymously in support of their ideas, while claiming access to &quot;secret ancient wisdom&quot;.

==Life==
Andreae was born at Herrenberg, Württemberg, the son of Johannes Andreae (1554–1601), the superintendent of Herrenberg and later the abbot of Königsbronn. His mother Maria Moser went to Tübingen as a widow and was court apothecary 1607–1617. The young Andreae studied theology and natural sciences 1604–1606. He befriended Christoph Besold who encouraged Andreae&#x27;s interest in esotericism. Ca. 1605 he wrote the first version of &quot;The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosekreutz&quot;. He was refused the final examination and church service, probably for attaching a &quot;pasquill&quot; (offensive, libelous note) to the chancellor Enzlin&#x27;s door, on the occasion of his marriage. After that, he taught young nobles and hiked with his students through Switzerland, France, Austria and Italy. He visited Dillingen, a bastion of the Jesuits, whom he regarded as the Antichrist. In 1608 he returned to Tübingen. He came to know Tobias Hess, a Paracelsian physician with an interest in apocalyptic prophecy. From 1610 till 1612 Andreae traveled.

In 1612 he resumed his theological studies in Tübingen. After the final examination in 1614, he became deacon in Vaihingen an der Enz, and in 1620 priest in Calw. Here he reformed the school and social institutions, and established institutions for charity and other aids. To this end, he initiated the &quot;Christliche Gottliebende Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Christian God-loving Society&quot;). In 1628 he planned a &quot;Unio Christiana&quot;. He obtained funds and brought effective help for the reconstruction of Calw, which was destroyed in the Battle of Nördlingen (1634) by the imperial troops and visited by pestilence. In 1639, he became preacher at the court and councillor of the consistory (&quot;Konsistorialrat&quot;) in Stuttgart, where he advocated a fundamental church reform. He became also a spiritual adviser to a royal princess of Württemberg.

Among other things, he promoted the Tübinger Stift, a hall of residence and teaching which was a seminary owned and supported by the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg, in South West Germany. The Stift was founded as an Augustinian monastery in the Middle Ages, but after the Reformation (in 1536), Duke Ulrich turned the Stift into a seminary which served to prepare Protestant pastors for Württemberg. A prominent student of the Stift during this period was Johannes Kepler.

In 1646, Andreae was made a member of the &quot;Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Fruitbearing Society&quot;), where he got the company-nickname &quot;der Mürbe&quot; (&quot;the soft&quot;). In 1650, he assumed direction of the monasterial school Bebenhausen, and in 1654, he became abbot of the evangelical monasterial school of Adelberg. He died in Stuttgart.

==Rosicrucianism==
His role in the origin of the Rosicrucian legend is controversial. In his autobiography he claimed that the &quot;Chymische Hochzeit&quot; (&quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot;) was one of his works—as a &quot;ludibrium&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;lampoon&quot;. In his &quot;Menippus&quot; (1617) he argued that he wrote this fake document in his youth, around 1605. In his later works, Andreae treated alchemy as a subject of ridicule and placed it with music, art, theatre and astrology in the category of the &#x27;less serious&#x27; sciences. It is uncertain how to interpret these statements. Was Andreae under pressure from the authorities because of his official relations as a clergyman, or had he in the meantime converted to a more homodox form of Lutheranism?

In a later phase of his life, Andreae expressed himself as a pious, orthodox Lutheran theologian who had nothing at all to do with the two great manifestoes of the secret society—the &quot;Fama fraternitatis&quot; or the &quot;Confessio fraternitatis&quot;. His lifelong commitment appears to have been to found a &quot;Societas Christiana&quot; or utopian learned brotherhood of those dedicated to a spiritual life, in the hope that they would initiate a second Reformation.

His writings and efforts provided a potent stimulus to Protestant intellectuals at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and he appears to have inspired the foundation of the &quot;Unio Christiana&quot; which was established in Nuremberg during 1628 by a few patricians and churchmen under the impetus of Johannes Saubert the Elder. This utopian society was later revived in Stuttgart in the early 1660s and another utopian brotherhood known as &quot;Antilia&quot; (a communal society reminiscent of the monastery) developed in the Baltic during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The founders were inspired by both Baconian belief in experimental science and by Andreae&#x27;s tracts. They later attempted to establish a colony on a small island in the Gulf of Riga, and considered immigrating to Virginia.

==Priory of Sion==
During the 1960s, as part of a hoax claiming the existence of a medieval secret society, a set of documents of dubious authenticity, the &quot;Dossiers Secrets&quot;, was discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF). One of the documents included an alleged list of &quot;Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion&quot;, and Andreae was listed as the seventeenth Grand Master.
