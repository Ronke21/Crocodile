<text>Laundry Service is the fifth studio album and first English-language album by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, globally released on 13 November 2001 by Epic Records. After her fourth studio album &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; became a success in Latin America, Spain, the Middle East and the Latin community in the United States, Shakira was encouraged by American singer Gloria Estefan to record songs in English as she believed her friend had the potential to cross over into the English-language pop market. Shakira was hesitant at first, but then decided to learn English well enough to write songs in the language. The title of the album reflects Shakira&#x27;s views on love and music. It was released as &quot;Servicio de Lavandería&quot; in Hispanic regions in January 2002. &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is primarily a pop rock record but it also experiments with Andean music, dance-pop, Middle Eastern music, rock and roll and tango music. The album&#x27;s theme is love and romance. Every song on it was written and produced by Shakira under the guidance of Emilio Estefan.

Six singles were released from the album. The lead single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; became an international success, reaching number one on record charts of Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The second English-language single &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; repeated that success, topping the charts of Australia, Austria, and Belgium. Both singles charted in the top ten in the United Kingdom and United States. Spanish-language singles &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; and &quot;Que Me Quedes Tú&quot; performed well in Hispanic regions, becoming hits in Spain and on the Latin record charts in the United States, respectively. The fourth single &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; became a top ten hit in most countries around the world, while the sixth and final single &quot;The One&quot; was a moderate commercial success. To promote the album, Shakira embarked on her Tour of the Mongoose between 2002 and 2003. It was her first major worldwide tour and visited many countries and cities.

&quot;Laundry Service&quot; received favourable to mixed reviews from music critics. Many critics complimented Shakira&#x27;s varied musical styles and originality, while some critics argued that the album sounded too generic. Shakira&#x27;s vocal talent also attracted praise. &quot;Laundry Service&quot; topped the charts of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Switzerland, while reaching the top five in Argentina, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United States, &quot;Laundry Service&quot; peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album received multiple record certifications, including sextuple platinum in Australia, quintuple in Canada, Spain and Switzerland. It was also certified multi-platinum in the United Kingdom and the United States, proving to be a successful crossover for Shakira. Globally, &quot;Laundry Service&quot; was the seventh best-selling album in 2002. The album sold around 13 million copies by 2011, making it one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, and is considered the best-selling album by a female Latin artist.

The album is listed at number 172 of the &quot;Definitive 200&quot; by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Background==
In 1998, Shakira released her second major label studio album &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; (&quot;Where Are the Thieves?&quot;), which became a success in Latin America and received record certifications in various countries like Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Spain. The &quot;rock en español&quot;-influenced Latin pop album drew comparisons to the work of Canadian-American singer songwriter Alanis Morissette and &quot;cracked the lucrative US market wide open&quot;, spending a total of 11 weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart. It became Shakira&#x27;s first album to receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; spawned the Arabian-styled single &quot;Ojos Así&quot; (&quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;), which became a hit and was deemed the &quot;signature track&quot; of the album.

Shakira&#x27;s record label at that time, Epic Records, opposed the decision to release and commission &quot;Laundry Service&quot; as they &quot;wanted her just to throw a couple of songs in English on a Latin music record.&quot; Gloria Estefan argued with Tommy Mottola, then head of Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Epic), and convinced him to release the album, arguing that an &quot;American audience&quot; would not buy a Spanish-language record simply due to its inclusion of a few English-language tracks. In an interview with &quot;Latina&quot;, she said &quot;I got in the trenches there with Tommy [Mottola] - I fought for that. Because they didn&#x27;t believe it. Just like they told us [her and Emilio during the Miami Sound Machine days]. They were trying to think in the box and I wanted to take her out of the box. And fortunately, Tommy, whom I love and adore and is a good friend, he really listened to me.&quot;

===Writing and recording===

The success of &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; prompted American singer Gloria Estefan in 1999, whose husband Emilio Estefan was managing Shakira at that time, to persuade Shakira to attempt to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so Estefan offered to translate &quot;Ojos Así&quot; into English in order to show her that &quot;it could translate well.&quot; Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded &quot;Quite honestly, I can&#x27;t do this better!.&quot; As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to find a method to express her &quot;day-to-day stories in English&quot;, Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor.

The first song she wrote was &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; and in an interview with &quot;Faze&quot;, she revealed that writing songs in English proved to be challenging for her: &quot;I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, and I remember I started writing the song [&#x27;Objection (Tango)&#x27;] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it&#x27;s really magical to me.&quot; After completing &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;, Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a &quot;dictionary in one hand and a thesaurus in the other.&quot; During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, &quot;If you check the subject of my songs, most of them talk about my own experiences and feelings and what I was actually going through in my life.&quot; 
Shakira collaborated with various writers and producers on the album including Estefan, Lester Mendez, Luis Fernando Ochoa and Tim Mitchell. Being &quot;more in control than ever&quot;, Shakira closely supervised the development of the album. The singer also served as the primary producer of the album.

==Composition==

Although primarily a pop rock album, &quot;Laundry Service&quot; also draws influences from a variety of musical genres. The singer credited this to her mixed ethnicity, saying &quot;I am a fusion. That&#x27;s my persona. I&#x27;m a fusion between black and white, between pop and rock, between cultures - between my Lebanese father and my mother&#x27;s Spanish blood, the Colombian folklore and Arab dance I love and American music.&quot; Arabian and Middle Eastern elements, which had a high influence on &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot;, are also present in &quot;Laundry Service&quot;, most prominently on &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; (Ojos Así). Musical styles from different South American countries surface on the album. Tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance that originated in Argentina, is evident on &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;, which also combines elements of rock and roll. The uptempo track features a guitar solo and a bridge in which Shakira delivers rap-like vocals. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; blends pop rock with Andean music and contains instrumentation from panpipes and the &quot;charango&quot; - traditional instruments generally associated with the genre.

A few songs are also influenced by dance-based genres; the &quot;feisty&quot; &quot;Rules&quot; is laced with new wave and &quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot; is inspired by disco music. The power ballad &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; has Shakira delivering &quot;racked&quot; vocals and features brass instrumentation influenced by English rock band The Beatles. It contains a melody similar to the one in &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, a 1989 song by American all-female band The Bangles. Similarly, the tune of &quot;The One&quot;, another power ballad on the album, is similar to that of &quot;Michelle&quot;, a 1965 song by The Beatles. &quot;Fool&quot; and &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot; are more directly influenced by rock music. The former received comparisons to the work of Alanis Morissette while the latter also displays indie elements and contains instrumentation from a soul music-styled horn section and guitar riffs similar to the one present in songs by American grunge band Nirvana. &quot;Laundry Service&quot; also contains four Spanish tracks: &quot;Que Me Quedes Tú&quot; (&quot;That You Remain With Me&quot;), &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; (&quot;I Leave You Madrid&quot;), &quot;Suerte&quot; (&quot;Luck&quot;) and &quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Warning You, I&#x27;m Announcing to You&quot;); the latter two are Spanish translations of &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;, respectively.

The lyrics of most songs in &quot;Laundry Service&quot; are based on issues and themes related to love, as they had been written after Shakira began a relationship Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is an &quot;ode&quot; to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an &quot;important side&quot; in &quot;The One&quot;, which is a song about how &quot;you love your guy so much that you&#x27;re actually going to learn to cook&quot; and contains lines like &quot;To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone.&quot; In &quot;Rules&quot;, she aims to make her lover realise that he is &quot;condemned&quot; to her and lists &quot;all the things your new boy can do.&quot; Songs like &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; and &quot;Fool&quot; also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a &quot;hell-hath-no-fury it&#x27;s-her-or-me steam train.&quot; In the song, Shakira asserts that &quot;Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That&#x27;s why in front of your eyes I&#x27;m invisible&quot;, which a reviewer commented was a &quot;brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers .&quot; &quot;Fool&quot; discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a &quot;shitty, self-absorbed man&quot; even after suffering a &quot;soul-crushing defeat.&quot;

==Release==
The album was globally released on 13 November 2001 in nations including Australia, France, Italy, Switzerland and the United States. In Latin American countries like Mexico, the album was released as &quot;Servicio de Lavandería&quot; in January 2002. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Laundry Service&quot; was released on 11 March 2002. On 12 November 2002, a limited edition version of the album entitled &quot;Laundry Service: Washed and Dried&quot; was released; this version of the album features three additional remixes and a bonus disc which contains multimedia content related to &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;.

Shakira chose to entitle the album &quot;Laundry Service&quot; as she wanted to represent her passion for love and music, which she compared to soap and water, saying &quot;The reason I named it &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is because I&#x27;ve spent the year dedicated to my two great passions: love and music. Those two elements are like soap and water. It was a deep cleansing, almost like being reborn.&quot; The artwork of the album was also designed by Shakira and shows a close-up of the back of a blonde-haired Shakira; a star and the name of the album are seen tattooed on her arm.

==Singles==

&quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Laundry Service&quot; on 30 August 2001. The song was commercially successful, peaking at number one in countries including Australia, Austria, France, Germany Italy, and more than 14 countries worldwide. In the United States, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; became Shakira&#x27;s first single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and peaked at number six. It stood as the singer&#x27;s highest peaking single on the chart until &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; reached number one in 2006. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; narrowly missed peaking atop the chart in the United Kingdom by reaching number two. &quot;Suerte&quot;, the Spanish-language version of the song, was also released and peaked at number one in Spain and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; attained numerous record certifications around the world, including multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Belgium, and Switzerland, platinum certifications in the United Kingdom, and a diamond certification in France. The accompanying music video of the song, which features Shakira belly dancing in various locations, was directed by Francis Lawrence and became popular on music video television channel MTV.

&quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; was released as the second single from the album in January 2002. It peaked at number seven in Spain but performed poorly on the Latin record charts in the United States, peaking at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart. Spanish bullfighter Julián López Escobar, better known by his stage name El Juli, filed a lawsuit against Shakira for using scenes of one of his performances in the music video for &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; without his permission.

&quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; was released as the third single from the album in February 2002. The song peaked atop the charts in Australia, Austria, and Belgium; it was certified platinum in the three countries. In other countries, it became a top five hit. &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; entered the top ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at number nine, while in the United Kingdom it reached number three. The accompanying music video for &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; was directed by Herb Ritts and depicts Shakira&#x27;s life on tour. Shakira&#x27;s then boyfriend Antonio de la Rua makes an appearance in the video and this led to music retailer Tower Records Argentina banning sales of her albums in the country. The reason behind the ban was that Antonio de la Rua&#x27;s father Fernando de la Rúa, who was the President of Argentina at that time, had resigned &quot;in the midst of profound economic and political turmoil in the country,&quot; and the decision to ban sales of Shakira&#x27;s albums was a &quot;direct protest against Antonio De la Rua—not Shakira.&quot;

&quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; was released as the fourth single in May 2002. Although it was not a commercial success as big as &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; or &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, the song performed well nonetheless. &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; became a top ten hit in most countries and reached the top five in Australia and Netherlands. The song was certified platinum in Australia and gold in France. It became the last single from &quot;Laundry Service&quot; to chart on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, on which it peaked at numbers 55 and 17, respectively. Directed by Dave Meyers, the music video for &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; features Shakira fighting her unfaithful lover and his mistress.

&quot;Que Me Quedes Tú&quot; was released as the fifth single in November 2002 and peaked at number 10 on the Spanish Singles Chart. It became a success on the Latin record charts in the United States, topping both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs and Latin Pop Airplay charts.

&quot;The One&quot; was released as the sixth and final single from the album in December 2002. It was a moderate chart success and reached the top 20 in most countries. &quot;The One&quot; became the only single from the album to not appear on any US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The music video for &quot;The One&quot; was directed by Esteban Sapir and Ramiro Agulla and shows Shakira singing the song while walking outside in the rain.

==Tour==

To promote &quot;Laundry Service&quot;, Shakira embarked on the Tour of the Mongoose from 2002 to 2003. The tour was the singer&#x27;s first worldwide tour and visited 50 cities and 30 countries, with its kick-off concert show held in San Diego, California. Various brands and franchises co-sponsored the tour, including international clothing brand Reebok and soft drink brand Pepsi. Seven buses and ten trailers were also employed to transport all the staff members. A stage covering 350 square meters was set up and preparations to arrange 280,000 watts of sound and light were made. A &quot;solid nine-piece band&quot; was hired to provide live instrumentation. Regarding the title of the tour, Shakira explained her decision to name it after the mongoose, saying:
&quot;Its called the Tour of the Mongoose, and the mongoose is basically one of the few animals who can defeat the most venomous snakes with just one bite. And that&#x27;s why I decided to name my tour that way, because I think that if we all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle.&quot;
Likewise, the theme of the tour was highly influenced by Shakira&#x27;s political views, and this was prominently seen during the performance of &quot;Octavo Día&quot;, a song from &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot;, during which a film showing puppet caricatures of George W. Bush, then-President of the United States, and Saddam Hussein, then-President of Iraq, playing chess with their moves being controlled by the Grim Reaper. During the opening of the concert shows, a &quot;massive&quot; stage curtain showing a &quot;mongoose and a cobra preparing for battle&quot; split and a giant cobra slowly began rising from the centre of the stage to reveal Shakira, who wore &quot;black leather pants and a black bikini top&quot; and performed barefoot. Shakira incorporated belly dancing moves in her performances and often played various instruments throughout the shows herself, including the harmonica. Eight songs from &quot;Laundry Service&quot; were included on the setlist of the tour. A more afro-punk oriented version of &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; was performed and featured instrumentation from bongos. As an intro to &quot;Rules&quot;, Shakira played the harmonica, guitar, and drums. She also played an electric guitar during the performance of &quot;Fool&quot;. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; was included in the encore segment of the shows and was &quot;made to feel even more celebratory by the massive amount of confetti shot on the crowd midway through.&quot; Shakira also performed covers of &quot;Dude Looks Like a Lady&quot;, a song by American hard rock band Aerosmith, and &quot;Back in Black&quot;, a song by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. Many performances made use of pyrotechnics and &quot;six-foot flames that shot from the stage.&quot;

In 2004, a live album of the tour was released as &quot;Live &amp; Off the Record&quot;. Aside from recording of the performances, the album included an hour-long documentary that shows Shakira &quot;touring the world and doing such fun things as blowing bubbles, getting massages, and being serenaded by a mariachi band.&quot; A promotional CD single featuring the live performances of &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot; and &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; was also released to promote &quot;Live &amp; Off the Record&quot;. The live album was certified platinum in France and gold in the United States.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary===

&quot;Laundry Service&quot; initially received mixed reviews, with critics expressing different opinions regarding the production and composition of the album. Alex Henderson from AllMusic commended Shakira&#x27;s songwriting abilities in English, calling it a &quot;challenge that she handles impressively well. Shakira, it turns out, sings quite convincingly in English,&quot; and also praised her different mixes of musical styles, saying &quot;Like Shakira&#x27;s Spanish-language albums, this self-produced CD is enjoyably eclectic; she successfully combines pop/rock with everything from tango on &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; and Andean music on &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; to Middle Eastern music on &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;. He concluded that &quot;&quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; remains Shakira&#x27;s most essential album, but &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is an excellent English-language debut for the South American vocalist.&quot; A critic from &quot;Billboard&quot; also favoured the presence of various musical styles on the album and commented that &quot;&quot;Laundry Service&quot; finds the 24-year-old artist unafraid of merging musical flavors,&quot; and complimented Shakira&#x27;s vocal talent. Similarly, the Entertainment.ie review of the album deemed the lyrical content &quot;surreal&quot; and the production &quot;no less bizarre [...] imposing breakneck tangos, twanging guitar solos and bizarre raps onto a familiar soft rock template.&quot; They felt that &quot;Laundry Service&quot; could not be called a &quot;great album&quot;, reasoning that &quot;the line between fascinatingly strange and offputtingly weird is a thin one, and &quot;Laundry Service&quot; crosses it far too often,&quot; but also stated that &quot;Even so, Shakira&#x27;s star quality can hardly be denied - and in today&#x27;s increasingly conformist pop industry that deserves at least two cheers.&quot;

Alexis Petridis from &quot;The Guardian&quot; lauded Shakira&#x27;s originality, opining that &quot;In an age of personality-free pop idols, Shakira&#x27;s glorious eccentricity makes her a true star,&quot; and commented that &quot;Every song contains at least one non sequitur so eccentric that it could be the work of 1970s rock surrealist Captain Beefheart&quot; and &quot;The music on &quot;Laundry Service&quot; gives the lyrics a run for their money in the oddball handicap.&quot; Although he felt that the use of samples on various songs &quot;displays an attitude to plagiarism that Noel Gallagher would consider cavalier&quot; and that &quot;no one could claim &quot;Laundry Service&quot; was a groundbreaking work of art,&quot; he concluded that &quot;its ramshackle production and imponderable lyrics are striking and unique. And these days, it&#x27;s hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering.&quot; Music critic Robert Christgau termed &quot;Laundry Service&quot; &quot;the Cher album Cher never made&quot; and attributed this to Shakira&#x27;s blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the &quot;stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure rock en Español&quot; and appreciated Shakira&#x27;s confident songwriting. Christgau also noted Shakira&#x27;s strong vibrato and constant changing of timbre in her vocals. Lisa Oliver from Yahoo! Music said that Shakira&#x27;s experimentation with different styles yield &quot;results ranging from corking to minging,&quot; but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying &quot;the biggest problem with &#x27;Laundry Service&#x27; is the anti-copying device that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even the most ardent homebody if only they could get off the computer long enough to hear it.&quot;

At the same time Shakira&#x27;s album evoked sharp criticism by a number of authors. David Browne from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, for instance, called the album a &quot;the ultimate in crossover nightmares&quot; and opined that Shakira&#x27;s incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying &quot;Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can&#x27;t decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)&quot;. Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of &quot;Laundry Service&quot;; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira&#x27;s production of the album, writing it off as &quot;generic&quot;. He felt that the album was &quot;extremely safe&quot; and speculated that the reason behind the album&#x27;s &quot;generic&quot; sound was due to the Estefans&#x27; involvement, saying &quot;when I read that she&#x27;s [Gloria Estefan] helping you with lyrics and he&#x27;s [Emilio Estefan] &#x27;executive producer&#x27;, and I hear the unmistakable hum of &#x27;moneymoneymoneymoney&#x27; in the background .&quot; Ernesto Lechner from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; complimented the singer&#x27;s voice as a &quot;wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion,&quot; but commented that the involvement of a &quot;battalion of producers and songwriters&quot; led to Shakira sounding &quot;downright silly&quot; on &quot;Laundry Service&quot; and also criticised &quot;her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore.&quot;

Some authors criticised Shakira&#x27;s first English album for the clumsy rhyme of its songs. Elizabeth Mendez Berry&#x27;s article in &quot;Vibe&quot; is particularly indicative in this sense. In reference to Shakira&#x27;s texts in English, the journalist wrote: &quot;While her Spanish-language albums sparkled with elegant wordplay, this record is rife with cliches, both musically and lyrically. [...] For Anglophone Latin lovers, Shakira&#x27;s lyrics are best left to the imagination.&quot; It has also been noted for its distinct place in her discography, being &quot;a far cry from her modern-day reggaeton-stylings and instead shows off how her remarkable voice can adjust to the wide-range of genres which feature.&quot;

===Retrospective===
In a 2020 review, Isabelia Herrera of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the album a &quot;formidable compendium of Shakira’s sonic and corporeal world&quot;, stating that it &quot;revealed her fascinating, idiosyncratic songwriting&quot; and that it &quot;laid the groundwork for Shakira’s legacy as a pop chameleon&quot;. In 2025, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 176 on its list of the &quot;The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far&quot;.

==Impact and legacy==
The album&#x27;s commercial success led to Shakira being deemed one of the most successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her &quot;Latin pop&#x27;s biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez&quot; and &quot;an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves.&quot; The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a &quot;sellout&quot;. This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde prior to the album&#x27;s release, which many viewed as a tactic to &quot;fit into the US market.&quot; Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, &quot;I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [my success] to be good news to my country. But it&#x27;s typical that when you see somebody who is so close to you growing, you feel that the very word &#x27;growing&#x27; is synonymous with leaving. My hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago.&quot; On the other hand, many viewed Shakira&#x27;s crossover success as a &quot;strong cultural statement&quot; as her musical style represented her mixed ethnicity.
In 2002, the singer was interviewed by Nobel Prize in Literature-winning Colombian novelist and journalist Gabriel García Márquez, who was &quot;astonished by her fantastical work-rate&quot; and said that &quot;Shakira&#x27;s music has a personal stamp that doesn&#x27;t look like anyone else&#x27;s and no one can sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention.&quot; In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar and sported &quot;bleached blonde curls and butter-wouldn&#x27;t-melt smiles for the kids down the front.&quot; However, critics argued that Shakira&#x27;s vocal style was very different from Spears&#x27;, with Ted Kessler from &quot;The Observer&quot; calling the former an &quot;operatic diva&quot; and writing that &quot;as soon as she opens her mouth, she slips into gear and motors powerfully past Britney&#x27;s breathy bump&#x27;n&#x27;grind.&quot; In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented that &quot;Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English &#x27;crossover&#x27; acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Latina&quot; magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira could emerge in her lifetime, to which she responded, &quot;I&#x27;m always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in what they do. And of course in music, undoubtedly.&quot; Shakira&#x27;s crossover success has been such that the media point out that possibly without its crossover many Latin artists such as Karol G, Becky G, Bad Bunny, Maluma or J Balvin would possibly not have the recognition that they enjoy today, and it is seen as a great step in the Latin industry since with the voice of Shakira the music industry would stop only focusing on American artists and Latinas would enter the arena such as Paulina Rubio, Thalía and even Fey who also ventured to conquer other audiences. Noting that thanks to Shakira, Latino artists now have a greater space in an international music industry in which prejudice and even racism continue to exist.

Shakira&#x27;s belly-dancing ability came into attention and gathered coverage during this period, especially due to the music video of the lead single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;. The song also became famous for one of its lines in which Shakira sings &quot;Lucky that my breasts are small and humble, so you don&#x27;t confuse them with mountains&quot;; it is often cited as an example of the unusual lyrical content of the singer&#x27;s songs. According to Steve Huey from AllMusic, many critics were &quot;divided as to the effectiveness of Shakira&#x27;s English lyrics, but nearly all agreed on her unique poetic imagery.&quot; Huey further commented that the song and its video turned Shakira into a &quot;star in the English-speaking world almost overnight.&quot; &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, along with &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, is considered to be one of Shakira&#x27;s signature songs.

<text>Yolanda Montes (January 3, 1932 – February 16, 2025), better known by her stage-name Tongolele, was a Mexican–American dancer, actress and vedette. At the time of her death, she was one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema.

==Early life==
Tongolele was born Yolanda Ivonne Montes Farrington in Spokane, Washington, United States, in 1932. As a child, she danced for the International Ballet of San Francisco, California, as part of a Tahitian revue.

In 1947, she moved to Mexico and was hired as a dancer by Américo Mancini, a theater impresario. She also appeared in the famous Cabaret Tívoli in Mexico City. Her stage name, &quot;Tongolele&quot;, came from mixing African and Tahitian words.

==Career==
Her career was sheltered by theatrical success in the main theaters and cabarets of Mexico City. Tongolele boosted the success of the &quot;Exóticas&quot;, a group of vedettes that caused sensation in Mexico in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although other vedettes appeared and became popular at the time (such as &quot;Kalantán&quot;, &quot;Bongala&quot; and Su Muy Key), none reached the levels of popularity of &quot;Tongolele&quot;.
Yolanda was baptized by Mexican journalist Carlos Estrada Lang as &quot;The Queen of Tahitian Dances&quot;, as each night she congregated a wide male audience who adored her perfect silhouette and feline movements that marked an era in Mexico.

She made her film debut in 1948 in the film &quot;Nocturne of Love&quot;, starring the actress Miroslava Stern. In 1948, she starred in the film &quot;¡Han matado a &quot;Tongolele&quot;!&quot;, directed by Roberto Gavaldón. The plot was developed in the Folies Bergère theater of Mexico City. At another level of the plot, several envious people attempted to assassinate her. The film premiered on September 30, 1948.
As a guest, she starred in &quot;El rey del barrio&quot; (1949) and &quot;Kill Me Because I&#x27;m Dying!&quot; (1951) and the musical &quot;Música de siempre&quot; (1956).

In 1966, she returned to the cinema and appeared in the terror film &quot;The Panther Women&quot;. In 1968 she was in the film &quot;El crepúsculo de un dios&quot;, directed and carried out by Emilio Fernández.

In 1971, Tongolele played in the Mexican-American co-production &quot;Isle of the Snake People&quot;. In the film, she appeared alongside the American actor Boris Karloff. The plot of the film was located on a small island in the middle of the ocean where some beautiful young women are transformed into blue-faced man-eating zombies. Tongolele played the role of &quot;Kalea&quot;, the dancer with the snake.
In the mid-1960s, CBS recorded a disc titled &quot;Tongolele sings for you&quot;, which included 10 songs.

With the rise of Mexico City&#x27;s nightlife in the 1970s and the rise of the vedettes, Tongolele resumed her career in nightclubs and movies, as well as appearing on television shows. In 1984 she debuted in telenovelas in a special performance in the melodrama &quot;La pasión de Isabela&quot;.

In 2001 she reappeared on Mexican television in the telenovela &quot;Salomé&quot;.

Between 2011 and 2013, Tongolele participated in the musical stage play &quot;Perfume of Gardenia&quot;.

In 2012, the vedette returned to the cinema with a brief appearance in the film &quot;El fantástico mundo de Juan Orol&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

In 1956, she married Cuban Joaquín González in New York City, who accompanied her until his death. In 1976, Joaquín suffered cardiac problems and he was given a pacemaker. On December 22, 1996, he died. With González, she had twin sons.

Montes died on February 16, 2025, at the age of 93.

<doc id="508821" wikidata="Q5630952" url="?curid=508821" title="HMCS Toronto (K538)">
<text>HMCS &quot;Toronto was a that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[Second World War]] and as a from 1953-1956. She was named for [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. She was later acquired by the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] and renamed Garm and then again in 1965 asHNoMS &quot;Valkyrien .

&quot;Toronto&quot; was ordered 1 February 1943 as &quot;Giffard&quot; (after Giffard, Quebec) as part of the 1943-1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 10 May 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding &amp; Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon and launched 18 September 1943. Her name was changed to &quot;Toronto&quot; and she was commissioned into the RCN on 6 May 1944 with the pennant K538.

==Background==
The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith&#x27;s Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a &quot;twin-screw corvette&quot;, its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name &quot;frigate&quot; was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year.

Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers.

River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN&#x27;s ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.

Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy.

==Service history==
Following extensive work-up exercises in the vicinity of Bermuda, &quot;Toronto&quot; was assigned to escort group EG 16 which operated out of at Sydney, Nova Scotia. It was during this time &quot;Toronto&quot; saw service in the Battle of the St. Lawrence for which the ship was awarded the Battle Honour &quot;Gulf of St. Lawrence - 1944.&quot; On 14 October 1944, &quot;Toronto&quot; was escorting ONS 33G when , a fellow escort, was torpedoed by . &quot;Magog&quot; suffered significant damage from the attack but managed to stay afloat and &quot;Toronto&quot; took her in tow. However while towing &quot;Magog&quot;, the other GNAT, an acoustic German torpedo, detonated in &quot;Toronto&quot;″s wake. &quot;Toronto&quot; handed off the towing duties to after she recorded a contact and departed to chase it down unsuccessfully.&lt;ref name=&quot;uboat/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following that she served with Halifax Force as a local escort until May 1945. In May she was assigned to as a training ship. On 27 November 1945, &quot;Toronto&quot; was paid off and placed in reserve at Shelburne, Nova Scotia.

As part of the planned reactivation of 21 frigates to combat the Soviet submarine threat, &quot;Toronto&quot; underwent conversion to a in 1952. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. &quot;Toronto&quot; was recommissioned with pennant number 319 on 26 November 1953 at Lauzon.

The frigate was made a part of the First Canadian Escort Squadron in December 1953. In April 1954, &quot;Toronto&quot; deployed to Bermuda for anti-submarine training with the British submarine and the American submarine before joining the First Canadian Escort Squadron on their training cruise through the Caribbean Sea, making several port visits. In September, the First Canadian Escort Squadron took part in the NATO naval exercise &quot;New Broom II&quot; and in October, the exercise &quot;Morning Mist&quot; before performing a two-month training cruise in the Mediterranean Sea, making several port visits. The squadron returned to Canada on 10 December 1954.

===Royal Norwegian Navy===
It was announced in November 1955 that three &quot;Prestonian&quot;-class frigates would be loaned to Norway; &quot;Toronto&quot;, and . &quot;Toronto&quot; was paid off by the RCN on 14 April 1956 and transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy as HNoMS &quot;Garm&quot;. &quot;Garm&quot; was purchased outright in 1959 and was employed primarily for fisheries protection duties. She was renamed in 1965 to &quot;Valkyrien&quot; and re-designated a torpedo boat depot ship. She served in this capacity until she was sold and scrapped by the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1977.

<text>Hhohho () is a region of Eswatini, located in the north western part of the country. Hhohho was named after the capital of King Mswati II, who expanded the Swazi territory to the north and west, taking in the districts of Barberton, Nelspruit, Carolina and Piet Retief. These areas were later acquired by what was the Province of Transvaal and today they form part of the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa. It has an area of 3,625.17 km², a population of 320,651 (2017), and is divided into 14 tinkhundla. The administrative center is the national capital of Mbabane. It borders Lubombo Region on the southeast and Manzini Region in the southwest.

==Etymology==

The name Hhohho was the name of the royal capital of Mswati II, a 19th-century king of Eswatini. After the Anglo-Boer war, Eswatini came under British administration. A partition of the country into districts followed and Hhohho was the name chosen for the northernmost district.

==History==
The region of Eswatini which is today Hhohho was inhabited in earlier times by the Khoisan people. Later, Bantu settlers of Nguni and Sotho origin established settlements in the area. The land was later conquered by King Sobhuza I in the early 19th century as he relocated his capital from Zombodze in present-day Shiselweni, to Zombodze in the centre of Eswatini. Sotho clans such as the Gama, Mnisi and Magagula, and Nguni clans such as the Maseko, were incorporated into the Swazi state. The royal capital of Sobhuza was built in what forms the Ezulwini valley (valley of heaven). This land was chosen for its impenetrability by invaders, and for its fertility, and good rivers.

Under the rule of King Mswati II, the royal capital of the king was constructed north of the country and was called Hhohho. This is the eponym of the Hhohho region. This briefly shifted the political centre of Eswatini northwards, first to minimise the danger of invasion by Zulu forces from the south, and later to expand and conquer lands in the north. Indeed, Mswati&#x27;s armies expanded the territory of Eswatini. More royal outposts were constructed in towns that are now in South Africa&#x27;s Mpumalanga province. The loss of the territory occurred after Mswati&#x27;s reign had ended, and was spurred by the concession hunters, and settlers in the territory that became the Transvaal Republic.

During Eswatini&#x27;s status as a British protectorate (1903–68), the borders of Hhohho were officially drawn, with its capital – and that of the country – being Mbabane. The British resident commissioner had his offices in the town. The city, the meaning of whose name is believed to originate from a “small and bitter highveld plant” that grew in the area, is named after Chief Mbabane Kunene.

== Industry ==
In the northwest of Eswatini, gold was discovered, drawing a large number of miners and settlers in the area. Gold deposits were first recorded around Piggs Peak mine during modern times in 1872 and in 1884 a gold-bearing reef was discovered in the hills to the west by the prospector, William Pigg, after whom the town is named. Pigg&#x27;s Peak represents one of the largest iron ore reserves in Eswatini and in the world having estimated reserves of 700 million tonnes of ore grading 35% iron metal. Other mining activity took place in the neighbouring town of Bulembu, where later on, asbestos was mined. The town of Ngwenya on the western border of Eswatini with South Africa, is home to the oldest known iron-ore mine in the world. Commercial scale mining took place in the mine until 1977.

==Law and government==
The Hhohho region is governed by the regional administrator, who is appointed by the king. The present regional administrator is HRH Princess Tsandzile. The seat of the regional administration is in the regional capital, Mbabane. Mbabane is also the administrative capital of Eswatini.

The legal system in Hhohho follows that of the whole country. There are magistrate courts which administer Roman-Dutch law.

==Administrative divisions==
Hhohho is subdivided to 14 tinkhundla (or constituencies). These are local administration centres, and also parliamentary constituencies. Each inkhundla is headed by an &quot;indvuna yenkhundla&quot; or governor with the help of &quot;bucopho&quot;. The tinkhundla are further divided into imiphakatsi (or chiefdoms). The present tinkhundla are:

* Hhukwini

* Lobamba
** Imiphakatsi: Elangeni, Ezabeni, Ezulwini, Lobamba, Nkanini

==Economy==
Hhohho is the most economically advanced region of Eswatini. Being home to the capital of the country, and hosting a significant fraction of the Manzini-Mbabane corridor, it has Eswatini&#x27;s biggest urbanized population. The economy of the region is dominated by services, tourism, and forestry. The capital, Mbabane, is home to the headquarters of many of Eswatini&#x27;s corporations. The central bank of Eswatini is located in Mbabane, as are the headquarters of Standard Bank, Nedbank, Swazi Bank, First National Bank and Eswatini Building Society. The other financial service organisations located in Mbabane include African Alliance, Select Management Services, and the Eswatini Revenue Authority, among many others.

The forestry industry is one of the most important sectors of the Hhohho economy. The area around the towns of Piggs Peak and Bulembu is home to many planted forests and sawmills. The wood is exported for processing in South Africa. The remaining agricultural sector remains very small. Most rural dwellers continue to cultivate rain-fed crops on Swazi Nation Land, and keep small amounts of livestock.

Mining in Hhohho declined significantly during the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. Mining in the early 19th century was the dominant industry with mines located in Ngwenya, Bulembu, Piggs Peak and other areas. Ngwenya mine is notable for its status as the oldest known iron ore mine in the world. Some mining activity still continues in this mine under the Indian mining company Salgaocar. The other mines in the region are no longer operational. The Bulembu mining town which was the main centre for asbestos mining has now diversified into other sectors, and is privately owned.

Tourism is one of the largest sectors of the Hhohho economy. The Ezulwini valley is Eswatini&#x27;s most famous tourist area with many hotels and restaurants. In Lobamba, the royal and legislative capital of Eswatini, various tourist attractions exist. These include the National Museum, the King Sobhuza II Memorial, and the Eswatini National Archives. The umhlanga festival, held at Ludzidzini Royal Kraal, is one of the most famous cultural events in Eswatini. Mantenga Falls and cultural village, also in the Zulwini valley, are magnets for Swazi cultural tourists. Further north of the region lies the Maguga dam and lodge, and further north is the Phophonyane Falls. Hhohho is also home to the Malolotja nature reserve, a place renowned for its hiking trails.

==Cultural==
Hhohho is home to the royal capital of Eswatini at Lobamba. Here the main cultural events of the country are held. These are the Incwala ceremony and the Umhlanga ceremony.

Hhohho is also home to art galleries such as the Indingilizi Gallery in Mbabane. Performance arts can be seen at the theater club, also in Mbabane.

===Education===
A campus of the national University of Eswatini is located in Mbabane, and specializes in health and environmental sciences. The Eswatini College of Technology (SCOT), is also located in Mbabane, and focuses on various technical trades. Recent tertiary institutions in the region are the Eswatini Christian University and a campus of Limkokwing University.

<doc id="508844" wikidata="Q1030203" url="?curid=508844" title="Phil Rizzuto">
<text>Philip Francis Rizzuto (September 25, 1917 – August 13, 2007), nicknamed &quot;the Scooter&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball shortstop. He spent his entire 13-year baseball career with the New York Yankees (1941–1956), and was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994.

A popular figure on a team dynasty that captured 10 AL titles and seven World Championships in his 13 seasons, Rizzuto holds numerous World Series records for shortstops. His best statistical season was 1950, when he was named the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Generally, Rizzuto was a &quot;small ball&quot; player, noted for his strong defense in the infield and as a great bunter. When he retired, his 1,217 career double plays ranked second in major league history, trailing only Luke Appling&#x27;s total of 1,424, and his .968 career fielding average trailed only Lou Boudreau&#x27;s mark of .973 among AL shortstops.

After his playing career, Rizzuto had a 40-year career as a radio and television sports announcer for the Yankees. He was known for his idiosyncratic, conversational broadcast style, and for his trademark expression &quot;holy cow!&quot;

==Early years==
Rizzuto was born on September 25, 1917, in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, the son of a streetcar motorman and his wife, both of whom were originally from Calabria, Italy. There has been confusion about his year of birth, stemming from Rizzuto&#x27;s &quot;shaving a year off&quot; the date at the beginning of his pro career, on the advice of teammates. Throughout his career, his birth year was reported as 1918 in &quot;The Sporting News, the Baseball Register&quot;, and the &quot;American League Red Book&quot;; later reference sources revised the year to 1917, indicating his age at the time of his death to be 89. After Rizzuto&#x27;s death, the &quot;New York Post&quot; broke a story reporting Rizzuto&#x27;s actual year of birth as 1916. However, it was subsequently reported that the New York City Department of Health said Rizzuto&#x27;s official birth certificate is, in fact, dated 1917.

Rizzuto grew up in Glendale, Queens. Despite his modest size — usually listed during his playing career as five feet, six inches tall and either 150 or 160 pounds, though he rarely reached even the lower figure — Rizzuto played baseball as well as football at Richmond Hill High School in Queens.

==Playing career==
Rizzuto signed with the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1937. His nickname, at times attributed to Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen, was actually bestowed on Rizzuto (according to him) by minor league teammate Billy Hitchcock because of the way Rizzuto ran the bases.

After receiving &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Minor League Player of the Year Award in 1940 while playing with the Kansas City Blues, he played his first major league game on April 14, 1941. Taking over for the well-liked Frank Crosetti, whose batting average had dropped to .194 after several strong seasons, Rizzuto quickly fit into the Yankees lineup to form an outstanding middle infield with second baseman Joe Gordon. In his syndicated column on October 1, Grantland Rice compared the pair favorably to the middle infield of the crosstown Brooklyn Dodgers: &quot;Billy Herman and Pee Wee Reese around the highly important keystone spot don&#x27;t measure up, over a season anyway, with Joe Gordon and Phil Rizzuto, a pair of light-footed, quick-handed operatives who can turn seeming base hits into double plays often enough to save many a close scrap.&quot;
Rizzuto ended his rookie season playing in the 1941 World Series, and though he hit poorly, the Yankees beat the Dodgers. In the following year&#x27;s World Series, Rizzuto led all hitters with a batting average of .381 and 8 hits. The light-hitting shortstop also contributed a home run, despite hitting just four in the regular season.

Like many players of the era, he found his career interrupted by a stint in the military, serving in the United States Navy during World War II. From 1943 through 1945, he played on a Navy baseball team alongside Dodgers shortstop Reese; the team was managed by Yankees catcher Bill Dickey.

Shortly after Rizzuto&#x27;s return to the Yankees for the 1946 season, he attracted the ire of new Yankees general manager, president, and co-owner Larry MacPhail, former president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. MacPhail had served in both World Wars, was hard-drinking, tempestuous, and often paranoid, but as a baseball executive was innovative and considered a near-genius despite being hobbled by alcohol and a volatile temper. In 1946 MacPhail became aware that Mexican millionaire and ball club owner Jorge Pasquel, just named president of the Mexican League and who with his wealthy two brothers had poached American players from the Negro leagues since 1943, was now courting Major League players. Several clubs lost players with others mentioned including the Yankees, and Phil Rizzuto was rumored to be considering a $100,000, 3-year contract. For that matter, a number of players on various teams had begun &quot;moonlighting&quot; in winter playing for Cuban teams. The disarray had to end. Baseball Commissioner Albert Happy Chandler, former Kentucky governor, announced on Opening Day that exclusivity clauses still ruled—all contract-jumping players heading to Mexico or Cuba would be suspended from the Major League for 5 years.

The New York Herald Tribune sent one of its star sportswriters, Rutherford &quot;Rud&quot; Rennie, down to Mexico to see what was up with the invigorated Mexican League and the ambitious Pasquel Brothers. By that time they had hired a trio of Mariachi musicians wearing sombreros to play outside at least one American stadium. The Trib&#x27;s Rennie sent several dispatches from Mexico, liking some things about the scene but disliking others. Rennie, who had covered the Yankees since the Roaring Twenties, was soon astounded when MacPhail sued the Mexican Baseball League and the restraining order named Rud Rennie as an &quot;agent&quot; of the foreigners. Court papers alleged that he had &quot;been seen&quot; in the Yankees locker room talking with his good friend Phil Rizzuto and other players and advocating contract-jumping. Hours later, the Dodgers and Giants owners hastened into court also; their teams were among the 10 who had actually lost a combined number of 23 players that season. The situation was hardly helped when retired Yankees slugger-hero Babe Ruth took his family on an extended Mexican vacation as guest of the Pasquels, and new rumors flew that Ruth was being wooed for a Mexican club manager&#x27;s job. The lawsuits soon moved to the US Supreme Court, but the Yankees&#x27; MacPhail saw he had overreacted in pushing a restraining order on Rennie for merely covering the news and maintaining good relationships with Rizzuto and teammates; the order was dropped, avoiding a potential first amendment fracas for Larry MacPhail, who would be edged out in a year. Perhaps at least partially caused by the court action and negative attention, the Yankees finished third in 1946 and Rizzuto&#x27;s average went down to .257. By 1947, Commissioner Chandler let Americans return to their home clubs with no penalty. And In 1947 the increasingly valued Rizzuto recorded a .969 fielding average, breaking Crosetti&#x27;s 1939 team record for shortstops of .968. He broke his own record the following year with a .973 mark.

Rizzuto&#x27;s peak as a player was 1949–50, when he was moved into the leadoff spot. In 1950, his MVP season, he hit .324 with 200 hits and 92 walks, and scored 125 runs. While leading the league in fielding percentage, Rizzuto handled 238 consecutive chances without an error, setting the single-season record for shortstops.

From September 18, 1949, through June 7, 1950, he played 58 games at shortstop without an error, breaking the AL record of 46 set by Eddie Joost in 1947–48; the record stood until Ed Brinkman played error-free for 72 games in 1972. Rizzuto recorded 123 double plays in 1950, three more than Crosetti&#x27;s total from 1938; it remains the Yankee record. Rizzuto&#x27;s 1950 fielding percentage of .9817 led the league, and came within less than a point of Lou Boudreau&#x27;s league record of .9824, set in 1947. Rizzuto&#x27;s mark was a franchise record until 1976, when Yankees shortstop Fred Stanley posted a mark of .983.

Rizzuto was voted the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player by a large margin in 1950, after having been the runner-up for the award behind Ted Williams in 1949. He became the only MVP in history who led the league in sacrifice bunts. Rizzuto played in five All-Star Games, in 1942 and each year from 1950 to 1953. In 1950, he also won the Hickok Belt, awarded to the top professional athlete of the year, and was named Major League Player of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He was voted top major league shortstop by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; four consecutive years (1949–52).

Rizzuto batted .320 in the 1951 World Series, for which the New York chapter of the BBWAA later voted him the Babe Ruth Award as the Series&#x27; top player. Decades later, Rizzuto still spoke resentfully of the incident in which pugnacious New York Giants second baseman Eddie Stanky sparked a rally by kicking the ball out of Rizzuto&#x27;s glove on a tag play. Ty Cobb named Rizzuto and Stan Musial as &quot;two of the few modern ball players who could hold their own among old timers.&quot; Yankees manager Casey Stengel had famously dismissed Rizzuto during that Brooklyn Dodgers tryout in 1935 when Stengel was managing that team, advising him to &quot;go get a shoeshine box.&quot; But Stengel ended up managing Rizzuto during five consecutive championship seasons, and would later say, &quot;He is the greatest shortstop I have ever seen in my entire baseball career, and I have watched some beauties.&quot; During his heyday, Yankees pitcher Vic Raschi noted, &quot;My best pitch is anything the batter grounds, lines or pops in the direction of Rizzuto.&quot; Decades into his retirement, teammate Joe DiMaggio characterized Rizzuto&#x27;s enduring appeal to fans: &quot;People loved watching me play baseball. Scooter, they just loved.&quot;

Rizzuto was noted for &quot;small ball&quot;, strong defense, and clutch hitting, which helped the Yankees win seven World Series. As an offensive player, he is particularly regarded as one of the best bunters of his era; he led the AL in sacrifice hits every season from 1949 to 1952. In retirement, he often tutored players on the bunt during spring training. In the announcing booth, Rizzuto talked about the several different kinds of bunts he would use in different situations. Later during his broadcasting career, he occasionally expressed disappointment that the art of bunting had largely been lost in baseball. Rizzuto was among the AL&#x27;s top five players in stolen bases seven times. Defensively, he led the league three times each in double plays and total chances per game, twice each in fielding and putouts, and once in assists. Rizzuto ranks among the top ten players in several World Series categories, including games, hits, walks, runs, and steals. Three times during his career, the Yankees played until Game Seven of the World Series; Rizzuto batted .455 in those three games (1947, 1952, 1955).

In Rizzuto&#x27;s obituary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; recalled a play that had occurred on September 17, 1951, with the Yankees and Cleveland Indians tied for first place and just 12 games left in the season:
:Rizzuto was at bat (he was righthanded) against Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians. It was the bottom of the ninth inning, in the middle of a pennant chase. The score was tied at 1. DiMaggio was on third base. Rizzuto took Lemon&#x27;s first pitch, a called strike, and argued the call with the umpire. That gave him time to grab his bat from both ends, the sign to DiMaggio that a squeeze play was on for the next pitch. But DiMaggio broke early, surprising Rizzuto. Lemon, seeing what was happening, threw high, to avoid a bunt, aiming behind Rizzuto. But with Joltin&#x27; Joe bearing down on him, Rizzuto got his bat up in time to lay down a bunt. &quot;If I didn&#x27;t bunt, the pitch would&#x27;ve hit me right in the head&quot;, Rizzuto said. &quot;I bunted it with both feet off the ground, but I got it off toward first base.&quot; DiMaggio scored the winning run. Stengel called it &quot;the greatest play I ever saw.&quot;

As the winning run scored, Lemon angrily threw both the ball and his pitching glove into the stands.

Rizzuto was released by the Yankees on August 25, 1956. Rizzuto often talked about the unusual circumstances of his release. Late in the 1956 season, the Yankees re-acquired Enos Slaughter, who had been with the team in 1954–55, and asked Rizzuto to meet with the front office to discuss adjustments to the upcoming postseason roster. They then asked Rizzuto to look over the list of Yankee players and suggest which ones might be cut to make room for Slaughter. For each name Rizzuto mentioned, a reason was given as to why that player needed to be kept. Finally, Rizzuto realized that the expendable name was his own. He called former teammate George Stirnweiss, who told him to refrain from &quot;blasting&quot; the Yankees because it might cost him a non-playing job later. Rizzuto said many times that following Stirnweiss&#x27; advice was probably the best move he ever made.

When he retired, his 1,217 career double plays ranked second in major league history, trailing only Luke Appling&#x27;s total of 1,424, and his .968 career fielding average trailed only Lou Boudreau&#x27;s mark of .973 among AL shortstops. He also ranked fifth in AL history in games at shortstop (1,647), eighth in putouts (3,219) and total chances (8,148), and ninth in assists (4,666).

At the time of his last game, he had also appeared in the most World Series games ever (52), a record soon surpassed by five of his Yankees teammates. Rizzuto still holds numerous World Series records for shortstops, including the most career games played, singles, walks, times on base, stolen bases, at-bats, putouts, assists and double plays.

==Personal life==

Rizzuto married Cora Anne Ellenborn on June 23, 1943; the two first met the previous year when Rizzuto substituted for Joe DiMaggio as a speaker at a Newark communion breakfast. &quot;I fell in love so hard I didn&#x27;t go home&quot;, Rizzuto recalled. He rented a nearby hotel room for a month to be near her. The Rizzutos moved to Hillside, New Jersey, in 1949, to an apartment in Monroe Gardens. With later financial successes, they moved to a Tudor home on Westminster Avenue, where they lived for many years.

At a charity event in New Jersey in 1951, Rizzuto met a young boy named Ed Lucas, who had lost his sight when he was struck by a baseball between the eyes on the same day as Bobby Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World.&quot; Rizzuto took an interest in the boy and his school, St. Joseph&#x27;s School for the Blind. Until his death, Rizzuto raised millions for St. Joseph&#x27;s by donating profits from his commercials and books, and also by hosting the Annual Phil Rizzuto Celebrity Golf Classic and &quot;Scooter&quot; Awards. Rizzuto and Lucas remained friendly, and it was through the Yankee broadcaster&#x27;s influence that Lucas&#x27;s 2006 wedding was the only one ever conducted at Yankee Stadium. Lucas was one of Rizzuto&#x27;s last visitors at his nursing home, days before his death.

Rizzuto was terrified of snakes. Knowing this, opposing players would sometimes play practical jokes on him by inserting rubber snakes into his baseball glove. Whenever this happened, Rizzuto refused to go near the glove until someone assured him the snake was artificial.

==Broadcasting career==
Rizzuto had options following his release by the Yankees, including a player contract from the Cardinals and a minor league offer from the Dodgers. Rizzuto instead decided to pursue broadcasting after receiving good reviews when he filled in for the New York Giants&#x27; wraparound host Frankie Frisch in September 1956 following Frisch&#x27;s heart attack. Rizzuto submitted an audition tape to the Baltimore Orioles. The Yankees&#x27; sponsor, Ballantine Beer, took notice, and insisted that the team hire Rizzuto as an announcer for the 1957 season. General manager George Weiss was obliged to fire Jim Woods, who had only been with the Yankees for four years, to make room for Rizzuto in the booth. When Weiss told Woods he was out in favor of Rizzuto, he said that it was the first time he had to fire someone for no reason.

Rizzuto broadcast Yankee games on radio and television for the next 40 years. His popular catchphrase was &quot;Holy cow.&quot; Rizzuto also became known for saying &quot;Unbelievable!&quot; or &quot;Did you see that?&quot; to describe a great play, and would call somebody a &quot;huckleberry&quot; if he did something Rizzuto did not like. During game broadcasts, he would frequently wish listeners a happy birthday or anniversary, send get-well wishes to fans in hospitals, and speak well of restaurants he liked, or of the cannoli he ate between innings. This chatter sometimes distracted the speaker himself; Rizzuto devised the unique scoring notation &quot;WW&quot; for his scorecard; it stood for &quot;Wasn&#x27;t Watching.&quot;

He also joked about leaving the game early, saying to his wife, &quot;I&#x27;ll be home soon, Cora!&quot; and &quot;I gotta get over that bridge&quot;, referring to the nearby and often-congested George Washington Bridge, which he would use to get back to his home in Hillside. In later years, Rizzuto would announce the first six innings of Yankee games; the TV director would sometimes puckishly show a shot of the bridge (which can be seen from the top of Yankee Stadium) after Rizzuto had departed. Rizzuto was also very phobic about lightning, and sometimes left the booth following violent thunderclaps.

Rizzuto started his broadcasting career working alongside Mel Allen and Red Barber in 1957. Among a number of announcers that Rizzuto worked with over the course of his career, Frank Messer (1968–1985) and Bill White (1971–1988) were the two most memorable. Rizzuto, Messer, and White were the main broadcast trio that presided over an important time period for the Yankees, which spanned from the non-winning CBS years through the championship seasons and other years of struggle during the Steinbrenner era. On television, for example, the Yankees broadcast team went unchanged from 1972 to 1982.

Rizzuto was twice assigned to broadcast the World Series while with the Yankees. He worked the 1964 series on NBC-TV and radio with Joe Garagiola when the Yankees faced the Cardinals. The next time the Yankees made it into the series, in 1976, Rizzuto joined Garagiola and Tony Kubek on NBC-TV when the Yankees faced the Reds. The 1976 World Series was the last to have a local voice from each of the two teams take part as guest announcers. WPIX and its usual Rizzuto-Messer-White broadcast trifecta carried the ALCS in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, and 1981, providing metropolitan area viewers a local alternative to the nationally broadcast telecasts.

Rizzuto would typically refer to his broadcast partners by their last names, calling them &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Murcer&quot; and &quot;Seaver&quot; instead of &quot;Bill&quot;, &quot;Bobby&quot; or &quot;Tom.&quot; Reportedly, he did the same with teammates during his playing days. Rizzuto developed a reputation as a &quot;homer&quot;, an announcer who would sometimes lapse into openly rooting for the home team. In 1978, on the televised postgame show, the news arrived that Pope Paul VI had just died. &quot;Well,&quot; said Rizzuto, &quot;that kind of puts the damper on even a Yankee win.&quot; &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine called that the &quot;Holiest Cow of 1978.&quot;

Rizzuto&#x27;s most significant moments as a broadcaster included the new single-season home run record set by Roger Maris on October 1, 1961, which he called on WCBS radio:

Here&#x27;s the windup, fastball, hit deep to right, this could be it! Way back there! Holy cow, he did it! Sixty-one for Maris! And look at the fight for that ball out there! Holy cow, what a shot! Another standing ovation for Maris, and they&#x27;re still fighting for that ball out there, climbing over each other&#x27;s backs. One of the greatest sights I&#x27;ve ever seen here at Yankee Stadium!

Rizzuto also called the pennant-winning home run hit by Chris Chambliss in the American League Championship Series on October 14, 1976, on WPIX-TV:He hits one deep to right-center! That ball is out of here! The Yankees win the pennant! Holy cow, Chris Chambliss on one swing! And the Yankees win the American League pennant. Unbelievable, what a finish! As dramatic a finish as you&#x27;d ever want to see! With all that delay, we told you Littell had to be a little upset. And holy cow, Chambliss hits one over the fence, he is being mobbed by the fans, and this field will never be the same, but the Yankees have won it in the bottom of the 9th, 7 to 6!

Rizzuto was also on the mic for the one-game playoff that decided the dramatic 1978 AL East race between the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, the Pine Tar game involving George Brett in 1983, and Phil Niekro&#x27;s 300th career win in 1985.

On August 15, 1995, the evening of the funeral of former teammate Mickey Mantle, the Yankees were set to play a road game against the Boston Red Sox. Announcing partner Bobby Murcer had already left to attend the funeral. Rizzuto was not permitted to leave, as the team needed someone to do the color commentary. Rizzuto abruptly left the booth after five innings, saying he could not go on. Rizzuto announced his retirement from announcing soon afterwards, which was attributed to the incident.

He was eventually persuaded to return for one more season in 1996, where he called another Yankee shortstop protégé, Derek Jeter&#x27;s first home run. He retired for good at the end of the season. Apart from military service, he had spent the first 60 years of his adult life in the Yankee organization as a minor league player (1937–1940), major league player (1941–1942, 1946–1956) and broadcaster (1957–1996). Although Allen has long been known as the &quot;Voice of the Yankees,&quot; Rizzuto is the longest serving broadcaster in Yankees history, serving 40 years to Allen&#x27;s 30 years over two stints.

==Other media appearances==
On February 2, 1950, Rizzuto was the first mystery guest on the 1950–67 Goodson-Todman Productions game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; hosted by John Charles Daly. Rizzuto made four more appearances on the program, three as a guest panelist in the 1956–1957 season following his retirement, and one in 1970 as the Mystery Guest on a later incarnation of the quiz show. Rizzuto also made various television appearances on programs such as CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; and &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;.

Alongside his broadcasts for the Yankees, Rizzuto hosted &quot;It&#x27;s Sports Time with Phil Rizzuto&quot;, a 5-minute weekday evening sports show, on the CBS Radio Network from 1957 to 1977.

Rizzuto was the longtime celebrity spokesman in TV ads for The Money Store. He was well known as their spokesman for nearly 20 years, from the 1970s into the 1990s.

Rizzuto provides play-by-play commentary during the long spoken bridge in Meat Loaf&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light.&quot; Ostensibly an account of a baseball sequence, it actually describes the singer&#x27;s step-by-step efforts to engage in coitus with a young woman (voiced by actress and singer Ellen Foley). When Rizzuto recorded his piece, he was reportedly unaware of how his spoken contribution would be used. When the song broke, Rizzuto said his parish priest called him in shock. However, &quot;Phil was no dummy&quot;, said singer Meat Loaf. &quot;He knew exactly what was going on, and he told me such. He was just getting some heat from a priest and felt like he had to do something. I totally understood.&quot; Years later, Rizzuto would laughingly retell the story saying he got snookered by Meat Loaf, but he had a good attitude about it and when Meat Loaf asked him to go on tour with him, Rizzuto was flattered but declined, jokingly saying that Cora would &quot;kill him&quot; if he did. Rizzuto was given a gold record for the album.

==Honors==

The Yankees retired Rizzuto&#x27;s number 10 in a ceremony at Yankee Stadium on August 4, 1985. During this ceremony, he was also given a plaque to be placed in the stadium&#x27;s Monument Park. The plaque makes reference to the fact that he &quot;has enjoyed two outstanding careers, all-time Yankee shortstop, one of the great Yankee broadcasters.&quot; Humorously, Rizzuto was accidentally bumped to the ground during his own ceremony, by a live cow wearing a halo (that is, a &quot;holy cow&quot;); both honoree and cow were unhurt. Rizzuto later described the encounter: &quot;That big thing stepped right on my shoe and pushed me backwards, like a karate move.&quot; In that day&#x27;s game, future broadcast partner Tom Seaver recorded his 300th career victory.

Most baseball observers, including Rizzuto himself, came to believe that Derek Jeter had surpassed him as the greatest shortstop in Yankees history. The Scooter paid tribute to his heir apparent during the 2001 postseason at Yankee Stadium; jogging back to the Yankee dugout, he flipped the ceremonial baseball backhand, imitating Jeter&#x27;s celebrated game-saving throw to home plate that had just occurred during the Yankees&#x27; 2001 American League Division Series triumph. ESPN reported that the photo of Jeter and Rizzuto taken that evening is one of Jeter&#x27;s most prized possessions.

In the spring of 1957, following Rizzuto&#x27;s release, Baltimore Orioles manager Paul Richards said, &quot;Among those shortstops whom I have had the good fortune to see in action, it&#x27;s got to be Rizzuto on top for career achievement. For a five-year period, I would have to take Lou Boudreau. ... But, year after year, season after season, Rizzuto was a standout.&quot; Sportswriter Dan Daniel wrote at the time, &quot;It seems to me that Rizzuto must be included among the few players of the past five years who may look forward to ultimate election to the Hall of Fame.&quot; However, Daniel&#x27;s assessment did not come to pass for over 35 years.

Rizzuto was elected to the Hall of Fame along with Leo Durocher (who was selected posthumously), in 1994 by the Veterans Committee, following a long campaign for Rizzuto&#x27;s election by Yankee fans who were frustrated that he had not received the honor. Some of Rizzuto&#x27;s peers supported his candidacy, including Boston&#x27;s Ted Williams. Williams once claimed that his Red Sox would have won most of the Yankees&#x27; 1940s and 1950s pennants if they had had Rizzuto at shortstop, but Rizzuto himself was more modest: &quot;My stats don&#x27;t shout. They kind of whisper.&quot; The push for Rizzuto became especially acute after 1984, when the committee elected Pee Wee Reese, the similarly regarded shortstop of the crosstown Brooklyn Dodgers.

Bill James later used Rizzuto&#x27;s long candidacy as a recurring focus in his book &quot;Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?&quot;, devoting several chapters to the shortstop&#x27;s career and comparisons with similar players. James assessed Rizzuto&#x27;s career statistics as historically substandard by Hall of Fame standards, although he acknowledged that credit must be given for the years he missed in World War II, and criticized many of the public arguments both for and against his selection; but despite noting that Rizzuto was a great defensive player and a good hitter he stated that he could not endorse his candidacy, as there were too many similar players with virtually identical accomplishments. The book&#x27;s final paragraph noted Rizzuto&#x27;s election to the Hall in February 1994. James, however, did point out that there were numerous players in the Hall who were inferior to Rizzuto, and in 2001 he selected Rizzuto as the 16th greatest shortstop of all time, ahead of eight other Hall of Famers.

Rizzuto was modest about his achievements, saying, &quot;I never thought I deserved to be in the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame is for the big guys, pitchers with 100 mph fastballs and hitters who sock homers and drive in a lot of runs. That&#x27;s the way it always has been, and the way it should be.&quot;

Rizzuto gave a memorably discombobulated induction speech at Cooperstown, in which he repeatedly complained about the buzzing flies that were pestering him. Rizzuto&#x27;s &quot;inimitable and wondrous digressions and ramblings&quot; were mimicked by &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Ira Berkow:Anyway, somewhere in the speech (Rizzuto) told about leaving home in Brooklyn for the first time when he was 19 years old and going to play shortstop in the minor league town of Bassett, Virginia, and he was on a train with no sleeper and when he got his first taste of Southern fried chicken and it was great and it was also the first time that he ever ate -- &quot;Hey, White, what&#x27;s that stuff that looks like oatmeal?&quot;—and Bill White, his onetime announcing partner on Yankee broadcasts, and, like all his partners, never seemed to learn their first names, though he knew the first and last names of a lot of the birthdays he forever is announcing and the owners of his favorite restaurants even though as he admits he often talks about the score or the game, but after 38 years of announcing games and after a 13-year playing career with championship Yankee teams few seem to care about this either, well, White was in the audience and stood up and said &quot;Grits&quot;.

In 1999, the minor league Staten Island Yankees named their mascot &quot;Scooter the Holy Cow&quot;, after Rizzuto. He was inducted in 2009 into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. There is a park named after him in Elizabeth, New Jersey, directly across from Kean University.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Rizzuto as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Death==
When Rizzuto did not attend the annual Cooperstown reunion in 2005 and the annual New York Yankees Old Timers Day in 2006, questions were raised about his health. His last public appearance came early in 2006; visibly frail, he announced that he was putting much of his memorabilia on the market. In September 2006, Rizzuto&#x27;s 1950 MVP plaque fetched $175,000, three of his World Series rings sold for $84,825, and a Yankee cap with a wad of chewing gum on it went for $8,190. The majority of the proceeds went to Rizzuto&#x27;s longtime charity of choice, Jersey City&#x27;s St. Joseph&#x27;s School for the Blind.

On September 12, 2006, the &quot;New York Post&quot; revealed that Rizzuto was currently in a &quot;private rehab facility, trying to overcome muscle atrophy and problems with his esophagus.&quot; During his last extensive interview, on WFAN radio in late 2005, Rizzuto revealed that he had an operation where much of his stomach was removed and that he was being treated with medical steroids, a subject he joked about in light of baseball&#x27;s performance-enhancing drugs scandal.

Rizzuto died in his sleep on August 13, 2007, three days short of the 51st anniversary of his last game as a Yankee, exactly twelve years after the death of Mickey Mantle, and just over a month shy of his 90th birthday. He had been in declining health for several years and was living at a nursing home in West Orange, New Jersey for the last months of his life. At the time of his death, at age 89, Rizzuto was the oldest living member of Baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Rizzuto was survived by his wife, Cora (who died in 2010), daughters Cindy Rizzuto, Patricia Rizzuto and Penny Rizzuto Yetto, son Phil Rizzuto Jr., and two granddaughters.

<text>The genus Spizella is a group of American sparrows in the family Passerellidae.

These birds are fairly small and slim, with short bills, round heads and long wings. They are usually found in semi-open areas, and outside of the nesting season they often forage in small mixed flocks.

==Systematics==
This genus was formerly placed with the Old World buntings in the family Emberizidae. However, genetic studies revealed that New World sparrows formed a distinct clade and thus it was placed in the resurrected family Passerellidae.

===Species===
* Chipping sparrow, &quot;Spizella passerina&quot;
* Clay-colored sparrow, &quot;Spizella pallida&quot;
* Brewer&#x27;s sparrow, &quot;Spizella breweri&quot;
** Timberline sparrow, &quot;Spizella breweri taverneri&quot;
* Field sparrow, &quot;Spizella pusilla&quot;
* Worthen&#x27;s sparrow, &quot;Spizella wortheni&quot;
* Black-chinned sparrow, &quot;Spizella atrogularis&quot;

The American tree sparrow, &quot;Spizelloides arborea&quot;, was formerly a member of this group, but is now placed in its own monotypic genus &quot;Spizelloides&quot;.

<text>New England Sports Network, popularly known as NESN , is an American regional sports cable and satellite television network owned by a joint venture of Fenway Sports Group (which owns a controlling 80% interest, and is the owner of the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool Football Club, and the Pittsburgh Penguins) and Delaware North (which owns the remaining 20% interest in the network as well as the Boston Bruins and TD Garden, home of the Bruins and the Boston Celtics). Headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, the network is primarily carried on cable providers throughout New England (except in Fairfield County, Connecticut, which is part of the greater New York City media market). NESN is also distributed nationally on satellite providers DirecTV and as NESN National via select cable providers.

NESN is the primary broadcaster of the Boston Red Sox and the Boston Bruins – serving as the exclusive home for all games that are not televised by a national network. NESN also carries minor league baseball games, regional college sports events, various outdoor and sports talk shows. The network has become synonymous with local sports in New England, and is considered a local institution.

==History==

The New England Sports Network launched on April 4, 1984, originally operating as a joint-venture of the Boston Red Sox, Boston Bruins, and Storer Communications (the owner of WSBK-TV). The new service which featured 90 Red Sox and 40 Bruins games during its first year was sold as a premium channel with prices ranging from $7.50 to $10 per month. A number of these games were previously aired on WSBK.

In 1996, NESN became the New England affiliate of Fox Sports Net (FSN), carrying the network&#x27;s national sports and magazine programs; this lasted until 1999. In January 1998, then-FSN parent News Corporation acquired partial ownership of Cablevision-owned SportsChannel New England (and its sister networks), turning it into Fox Sports Net New England (now NBC Sports Boston). However, despite the name change Fox Sports New England was blocked from carrying any FSN programming due to NESN&#x27;s existing affiliation agreement. Fox had hoped to negotiate an early termination of that agreement, but had to wait until it expired on December 31, 1999.

NESN converted into a basic cable service in 2001, a model that has since been copied by other companies through their respective launches of new regional sports networks as well as similar conversions (many of which predate NESN&#x27;s transition) of those that began as pay services. Afterwards, until early 2006, NESN carried simulcasts of ESPNews during the afternoon and overnight hours. NESN has carried regional Atlantic Coast Conference college basketball games since Boston College joined the conference, including games distributed for national broadcast for and by Fox Sports Networks.

In September 2003, NESN began producing Red Sox games in high definition. In April 2006, NESN launched a full-time HD feed, after having re-located its operations from Fenway Park to a newly-built studio in Watertown with expanded production capabilities.

In 2013, NESN (through Fenway Sports Group) placed a bid to acquire the New England Media Group from The New York Times Company, which would have placed it under the common ownership of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;; Fenway dropped out of the bidding in July.

On August 30, 2014, the network became a charter cable affiliate of the American Sports Network, a sports syndication service founded by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, with its first ASN broadcast being a college football game between the Old Dominion Monarchs and the Hampton Pirates. NESN and NESN National also agreed to carry certain games from the inaugural season of the Fall Experimental Football League in October and November 2014.

On June 1, 2022, NESN became the first U.S. regional sports network to offer its content on a direct-to-consumer basis.

On February 24, 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery, owners of AT&amp;T SportsNet, announced that it would leave the RSN business. This included AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh, the broadcasting home of the Pittsburgh Penguins, which were purchased by FSG in late 2021. In August 2023, in a move predicted by sportswriters after the initial announcement, the Penguins announced that they would acquire the channel and relaunch it as SportsNet Pittsburgh in October 2023, with NESN operating the channel as a sister network.

==Sports coverage==

===Boston Red Sox===
NESN has provided coverage of the Boston Red Sox&#x27;s Major League Baseball games since the network&#x27;s initial spring training game broadcast upon its March 21, 1984, launch. NESN now carries full coverage of Red Sox games (with the exception of some games nationally broadcast on Fox and ESPN) as well as in-depth pre-game and post-game shows. For its first two decades, NESN split coverage with broadcast television stations in the team&#x27;s market territory, with an increasing number of games moving to NESN. Since 2006, NESN is the exclusive home of all Red Sox games that are not nationally televised, using the slogan &quot;One Nation, One Network&quot; to signify this. In 2006, NESN became the first regional sports network to broadcast all Major League Baseball games in high definition (however, spring training games continued to be broadcast in standard definition until 2012), through the launch of its simulcast feed NESN HD.

On August 25, 2015, NESN announced that Don Orsillo, a Red Sox announcer since 2001, would not return following the 2015 season, and that his replacement would be Dave O&#x27;Brien, who had been a Red Sox Radio Network voice since 2007. NESN&#x27;s decision to replace Orsillo, a fan-favorite and Massachusetts native, was met with considerable outrage and disappointment by Red Sox fans. Orsillo&#x27;s broadcast partner, the late Jerry Remy, was emotional following the announcement, calling the previous 15 years &quot;an absolute pleasure [...] I&#x27;ve been very fortunate because I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of good people, and he&#x27;s right at the top of the list.&quot; Fox Sports San Diego subsequently announced that Orsillo had been hired as the new play-by-play voice of the San Diego Padres, succeeding Dick Enberg (who would be retiring after the 2016 season).

For Red Sox game broadcasts, Dave O&#x27;Brien currently serves as play-by-play announcer, with Kevin Youkilis as his primary color commentator, and Jahmai Webster serving as the field reporter. Other former Red Sox players such as Lou Merloni, Will Middlebrooks, and Kevin Millar also contribute as color commentators.

In 2021, NESN produced all Red Sox home games in 4K with HDR, making it the second team (behind the Toronto Blue Jays and Sportsnet), and first U.S. team, to produce their home games in 4K.

====Post-game====
Following each game telecast, NESN airs &quot;W.B. Mason&#x27;s Extra Innings&quot; and &quot;Red Sox Final&quot;, in which Tom Caron and one or more of the studio analysts from the pre-game show deliver a wrap-up of that night&#x27;s game from the studio. The team presents highlights and statistics from the preceding game and often have a team member of the Red Sox on hand to get their take on the game. This hour of coverage also focuses on the game to be played next on the preseason/seasonal game schedule, as well as news from the league. The post-game is usually not covered if the Red Sox play a game held on the west coast; &quot;NESN Sports Today&quot; immediately follows the game in those instances. Since 2006, NESN has broadcast the postgame show from its Watertown studios; it had previously been broadcast from its Fenway Park studio.

These games have since been moved to The CW as of 2023. Through the late 2010’s, the network served as an affiliate of Fox Sports Networks and the American Sports Network, giving it access to collegiate sports events from the AHA, American Athletic Conference, Atlantic 10, Big 12, Big East, CAA, Conference USA, ECAC, Pac-12, and Patriot League, among other conferences. Additional collegiate programming formerly carried by NESN includes Southern New Hampshire University athletics, UMass football, and the Coaches vs. Cancer annual basketball event held at TD Garden.

=== NESN 360 ===
NESN 360 (formerly NESNgo) is NESN&#x27;s streaming platform, allowing NESN subscribers to stream live and video on demand content (including classic games and game replays) from the network. It first launched in May 2017.

On June 1, 2022, NESNgo was relaunched as NESN 360, an over-the-top streaming platform allowing viewers to subscribe to NESN as a standalone service. The service made NESN the first U.S. regional sports network to offer its content on a direct-to-consumer basis. The service was priced at $29.99 per-month and $329.99 per-year, with the latter also including eight tickets to Red Sox games as a promotional offer. NESN 360 uses the same architecture previously used by NESNgo, and remains available at no additional charge to those who subscribe to NESN through a traditional television provider. Due to regional rights restrictions, the service is only available to users in New England. (Excluding Fairfield County, CT)

===NESN+===
NESN+, also styled as NESNPlus, is a companion channel to NESN that operates mostly in the event that two sports events NESN has the rights to are subject to scheduling conflicts. Originally, Comcast systems in the region utilized New England Cable News or CN8 to carry the NESNPlus broadcasts, while other systems placed NESNPlus on an otherwise unused or local public access channel. DirecTV added NESNPlus in both standard definition and high definition on April 11, 2009.

Collegiate events, including Atlantic Coast Conference telecasts, Umass football and Hockey East telecasts, as well as NESN&#x27;s coverage of the minor league Worcester Red Sox and NESN&#x27;s coverage of the WNBA&#x27;s Connecticut Sun are often moved to NESN+ in the event of a conflict with NESN&#x27;s Red Sox or Bruins coverage.

===NESN National===
NESN National is a separate feed of NESN for cable systems located outside of New England. It carries alternate programming during Red Sox and Bruins games, but does air the network&#x27;s pre-game and post-game shows. Launched in September 2010, Time Warner Cable became the first provider to carry the national feed, initially on its systems in North and South Carolina. Bright House Networks added NESN National on its Michigan systems on November 1, 2010. Verizon Fios added it in New Jersey in December of that year. NESN National differs from the regular feed of NESN that is available nationally on DirecTV in which Red Sox and/or Bruins games are viewable outside of New England with a subscription to MLB Extra Innings and/or NHL Center Ice.

=== NESN Nation ===
NESN Nation is a FAST channel launched in 2025. , NESN Nation was available on The Roku Channel and Plex. NESN Nation agreed to broadcast four Northeast Conference college basketball games in 2025. The games include one men&#x27;s regular-season game featuring Mercyhurst at Stonehill on February 15, one semifinal game of the NEC men&#x27;s tournament, one women&#x27;s regular-season game featuring Wagner at Saint Francis and one semifinal game of the NEC women&#x27;s tournament.

=== NESN.com ===
NESN.com generally contains sportswriting, with a minimum of video content, compiling general Boston team and national sports news, along with other sections involving professional wrestling, mixed martial arts, automotive, fantasy sports and sports betting. The site is affiliated with the Fox Sports website, and syndicates some content.

The site&#x27;s set up is in a focused manner that divides it into separate sections where different sports writers cover each scene. In this way, NESN reporters produce original content that develops in their field areas. Some reporters are full time exclusively to NESN.com while other stories are contributed by NESN reporters from other fields of NESN, such as broadcasting.

The content and construction of the articles themselves vary drastically. Some provide in-depth analysis of current events happening with Boston teams, while others provide quick updates with videos. A majority of the articles, however, are purely factual and present interviews with players and coaches. Some articles also focus on new trade rumors or free agent pick ups. The primary subscriber and reader of NESN.com is male. NESN.com is the most recently added product that contributed to NESN being &quot;the eighth-most valuable sports brand in the world in 2013.&quot;

<doc id="508853" wikidata="Q1327607" url="?curid=508853" title="King Zhuangxiang of Qin">
<text>King Zhuangxiang of Qin (281– 6 July 247 BCE), personal name Ying Yiren, Ying Ziyi or Ying Zichu, was a king of the Qin state. He was the father and predecessor of Qin Shi Huang, who would later unify China proper and become China&#x27;s first emperor. He was posthumously honored as &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; by the Qin dynasty.

==Life==
Yiren was born to Lord Anguo, the second son and heir apparent of King Zhaoxiang, and Lord Anguo&#x27;s concubine Lady Xia. He was chosen to serve as a political hostage in the Kingdom of Zhao. In Handan (the capital of Zhao), he met a merchant, Lü Buwei, who saw Yiren as extraordinary and detected in him the potential to become the king of Qin in the future. Lü Buwei treated Yiren well and presented his concubine Lady Zhao to Yiren. Lady Zhao later bore Yiren a son, Ying Zheng.

In the meantime, through bribes and machinations, Lü Buwei helped Yiren return to Qin. He also successfully conditioned Lord Anguo&#x27;s primary spouse, the childless Lady Huayang, to adopt Yiren as her own son, thereby making Yiren become Lord Anguo&#x27;s legitimate heir apparent. As Lady Huayang was a native of the Chu state, she renamed Yiren to &quot;Zichu&quot; ( &quot;son of Chu&quot;). Upon the death of King Zhaoxiang in 251 BCE, Lord Anguo ascended the throne and became historically known as &quot;King Xiaowen&quot;, but he died in the following year just three days after the date of his coronation. Zichu succeeded his father as the king of Qin and became historically known as &quot;King Zhuangxiang of Qin&quot;. He named Lü Buwei as his chancellor, Lady Zhao as his queen consort, and Ying Zheng as his crown prince.

Zhuangxiang died in 247 BCE after reigning for three years and was succeeded by Ying Zheng. Ying Zheng unified China and founded the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE, becoming historically known as &quot;Qin Shi Huang&quot; (First Emperor of Qin).

He was posthumously declared as Taishang Huangdi by Ying Zheng.

==Popular culture==

He is portrayed by Mao Zijun in the Chinese television series &quot;The Legend of Haolan&quot; (2019).

<text>The ethno-linguistic composition of [[Austria-Hungary]] according to the census of 31 December 1910 was as follows:

== Population==


===Largest cities===
Data: census in 1910

== Languages==

In the Austrian Empire (Cisleithania), the census of 1911 recorded &quot;Umgangssprache&quot;, everyday language. Jews and those using German in offices often stated German as their &quot;Umgangssprache&quot;, even when having a different &quot;Muttersprache&quot;. The Istro-Romanians were counted as Romanians.

In the Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania), the 1910 census was based on mother tongue. According to the census, 54.4% of the inhabitants of Hungary were recorded to speak Hungarian as their native language. This number included the Jewish ethnic group (around 5% of the population) who were overwhelmingly Hungarian-speaking (the Jews tending to declare German as mother tongue due to the immigration of Jews of Yiddish/German mother tongue).

=== Cisleithanian states (Austrian Empire) ===
=== Transleithanian lands (Kingdom of Hungary) ===

====Historical regions====

The Germans in Croatia were mainly living in the eastern parts of the country where they had been settled along the Drava and Danube rivers, and the former Military Frontier (), after the Habsburg (re)conquest of the area from the Ottomans in 1687.

<doc id="508860" wikidata="Q1191625" url="?curid=508860" title="Toyama Airport">
<text>is an airport located in the city of Toyama, Toyama Prefecture, Japan. It services are primarily domestic flights and international flights to China and Taiwan: however, seasonal international charter flights also service Toyama from April to June.

Located approximately south of central Toyama, the airport is part of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route and is the closest international airport to UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gokayama. As the airport has convenient access to downtown Toyama and various highways, the airport also serves a wide area of the Jōetsu region of Niigata Prefecture and Hida region of Gifu Prefecture.

The airport opened on August 20, 1963, with regularly scheduled flights by All Nippon Airways to Tokyo Haneda Airport using a Fokker F-27. This was replaced by a NAMC YS-11 in 1970. In 1984, the runway was lengthened from 1200 to 2000 meters to accommodate jet operations and a new terminal building was completed. An international terminal was completed in March 1993, Asiana and Aeroflot becoming the first international airlines to schedule service to the airport from Seoul and Vladivostok respectively. In late 1990s, Aeroflot terminated the link to Vladivostok, while Asiana retained it.

It is the only airport built on a riverbed in Japan, and the runways and aprons are located on the riverbed on the right bank of the Jinzū River. The terminal building is outside the river, and the boarding bridge built across the levee is Japan&#x27;s longest. Because of the location of the riverbed, it was not possible to completely install the instrument landing system, which restricts operations in poor visibility due to heavy snow in winter. In addition, physical restrictions are severe, as there is little space on the site and taxiways can not be made to both ends of the runway (there is no parallel taxiway, and planes must made takes a U-turn on a turning pad at the end of the runway for takeoff. The number of departure and arrival flights is limited to 15 per day according to the local agreement. Although plans to relocate the airport, possibly to an offshore location, were discussed, traffic to the airport has decreased dramatically with the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen in March 2015.

<doc id="508861" wikidata="Q11703876" url="?curid=508861" title="Simón Trinidad">
<text>Simón Trinidad (born July 30, 1950) is the alias of Juvenal Ovidio Ricardo Palmera Pineda, a high-ranking member of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and reputedly the first high-ranking member of that guerrilla group to be captured. &quot;Simón Trinidad&quot; is currently serving a 60-year sentence in solitary confinement in the United States at ADX Florence &quot;Supermax&quot; prison near Florence, Colorado with a scheduled release date of February 17, 2055.

==Early life==
Palmera was born into a traditional landowner family in the city of Valledupar in the Colombian northern Cesar Department, on July 30, 1950. Son of Liberal leader Juvenal Palmera and Alicia Pineda de Palmera. He was named Juvenal Ricardo Ovidio Palmera Pineda, with an unusual third name to his name. He is known to have three siblings: two sisters, Leonor and Elsa and a brother, Jaime.

He spent most of his childhood in Valledupar, where he attended middle school classes in the public school &quot;Colegio Nacional Loperena&quot;, one of the better schools in the city at that time. He also frequented the Valledupar Social Club. Part of his high school education was completed in the &quot;Colegio Helvetia&quot; in Bogotá. He spent his last two years of schooling in Cartagena, in the &quot;Naval School of Cartagena&quot;. He then enrolled in the Jorge Tadeo Lozano University, in Bogotá, where he studied Economics. It is frequently said that he also attended Harvard University, where supposedly he completed graduate work in business economics, however he does not speak English as he recognized during an interview in 2012.

After graduation, he returned to Valledupar and started working for the government-owned agrarian savings bank &quot;Caja Agraria del Cesar&quot; as a financial adviser. During this time he married.

He then started to work for the administrative staff of the Popular University of Cesar and also became part of the academic cadre as a professor of Colombian Economic History in the Administrative Sciences Department. At the same time, he also worked as bank manager for the privately owned &quot;Banco del Comercio&quot; (Bank of Commerce).

While teaching at the Popular University of Cesar, Palmera, some fellow professors and others became leftists. They perceived that bipartisan Colombian administrations ignored the pleas of the poor peasants in the area for fairer credit and land reform. By September 1981, Palmera, Jaime Sierra, Tomás Agudelo and Federico Palacios Romaña had created a group named &quot;Los Independientes&quot; (The Independents) of Marxist-Leninist orientation. They also supported the Patriotic Union Party created in 1985. This party was subject to political violence from drug lords, paramilitaries and military agents, leading to the forced disappearances, kidnappings and assassinations of many of its members, while others later became active guerrillas or refugees overseas.

In 1987, after a peasant strike in the Alfonso López plaza in Valledupar, Palmera stole 30 million pesos from the bank where he was working as a manager and escaped into the mountains, apparently joining the FARC at this time. He also took with him financial records that he would later use for extortion and kidnapping of traders and landowners.

==Life in FARC==

Colombian authorities suspect that Palmera became part of the FARC-EP in 1987, confirming this in 1991. By then he was believed to be in command of FARC&#x27;s Front 41, created by Palmera in June 1990, which operated in the area of the Serranía del Perijá mountain range. Palmera had adopted the aliases of Simón Trinidad and Federico Bogotá, and later also became part of the &quot;Bloque Caribe&quot; (Caribbean Bloc of the FARC-EP) in the Northern coast of Colombia.

His area of operations included Valledupar. Despite Valledupar&#x27;s being a relatively small city, with less than 300,000 inhabitants, kidnappings in the city would rise, eventually becoming the city with the highest kidnapping rate in Colombia.. Paramilitary groups also began to grow in the region.

In May 1992, Palmera and Abelardo Caicedo (aka &quot;Solís Almeida&quot;), ordered the kidnapping and later the murder of Colombian Navy Lieutenant Álvaro Fernando Morris Piedrahíta. On August 17, 1994, he was assigned to command the Front 19 known as &quot;José Prudencio Padilla&quot; that operated in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains.

On December 11, 1995, Colombian authorities learned that &quot;Simón Trinidad&quot; had become the sixth commander in-line of the FARC&#x27;s Caribbean Bloc, being in charge of guerrilla propaganda. In November 1996, Colombian authorities discovered that Palmera was now third in the chain of command of the &quot;Estado Mayor del Bloque Caribe&quot; (Major State of the Caribbean Bloc; the higher command of this bloc).

In 2000, investigators from Human Rights Watch interviewed Palmera in Los Pozos, Caquetá. He was quoted as dismissing international humanitarian law as a &quot;bourgeois concept&quot;.
On July 4 of the same year, while in San Vicente del Caguán, Caquetá and acting as FARC&#x27;s speaker, he announced that the group was going to attack any aircraft or troops that performed any fumigation on coca or poppy plantations in southern Colombia.

He continued to participate as a highly visible negotiator during the failed 1998–2002 FARC-Government peace process (1999–2002) held under Conservative President Andrés Pastrana.

==Capture==

Palmera was captured in January 2004 in Quito, Ecuador, by local authorities and speedily deported to Colombia, where he faced charges for rebellion, the kidnapping and later assassination of Colombian former minister Consuelo Araújo and various other criminal offenses that he allegedly committed, including the extortion or kidnapping of several of his former banking associates, former childhood friends and relatives. His exact rank within the FARC was not made clear by either the rebels or Colombian authorities at the time of his capture.

==Extradition==

In November 2004, the Colombian Supreme Court approved the extradition of Palmera to the U.S., on charges related to the drug trade and money laundering. The extradition would then proceed if President Uribe gave final approval to the move.

In a communique dated November 28 but released on December 3, the FARC declared that Trinidad&#x27;s extradition would be a serious obstacle to reaching a prisoner exchange agreement with the Colombian government.

On December 17, 2004, the Colombian government authorized Palmera&#x27;s extradition to the United States, but stated that the measure could be revoked if the FARC released all 63 (political and military) hostages in its possession before December 30.

The FARC did not accept this demand, and Palmera himself had previously stated that he considered his future extradition and prosecution in the U.S. an opportunity to publicly protest against the Uribe administration. As the deadline passed, the Colombian military was placed on high alert, and the U.S. embassy in Bogotá issued a terrorism alert to U.S. citizens in Colombia. The extradition was signed by president Álvaro Uribe and Palmera was placed on a DEA aircraft bound for Florida. &quot;Simón Trinidad&quot; was extradited to the United States in the afternoon of December 31, 2004.

==Trials==

===1st U.S. trial===

====Pre-trial====
In February 2005, Ricardo Palmera appeared before a Washington court for a pre-trial hearing, where he pleaded not guilty to the prosecution&#x27;s charges of drug trafficking and terrorism. The prosecution had asked for, and received, at least a three-month period for the gathering and translation (if applicable) of the necessary evidence. The legal complexities of the case and the paperwork involved set back the date of the trial for at least six months.

Palmera has also been accused of &quot;hostage taking&quot; because of his alleged complicity in the capture of three U.S. contractors, who crashed while conducting surveillance over rural areas under FARC influence and control. Palmera has been related to this case due to his alleged admission that he had traveled to Ecuador, where he was arrested, in order to arrange for the negotiation of a prisoner exchange with the Colombian government. The defendant argued that such efforts were made under the auspices of the UN. There is apparently no evidence that Trinidad had any personal connection with the plane crash, or the decision to take the US contractors captive. The other &quot;co-defendant&quot; in Palmera&#x27;s case is the entire FARC organization. Judge Thomas Hogan authorized the publishing in Colombian newspapers of a summons for the FARC organization to appear in court to answer the charges.

The court heard arguments on Palmera&#x27;s status as a prisoner of war in January. Simon Trinidad&#x27;s Colombian lawyer testified at the same hearing to rebut FBI claims that he had consented to the interrogation of Mr. Trinidad without the assistance of legal counsel, something totally forbidden in Colombian law. The court has yet to rule on combatant immunity, the admissibility of the alleged confessions to the FBI, and of evidence of other crimes allegedly occurring in Colombia.

After his extradition to the United States, Simón Trinidad was held in Washington, D.C., without access to his lawyer.

====Trial====

=====Prosecution arguments=====
* Simón Trinidad is part of the Central Command of FARC, and as a high-ranking member he should pay for the crimes perpetrated by the organization.
* Trinidad participated in and/or conspired in the kidnapping of three American citizens in February 2003.
* He is part of the terrorist group that kidnapped the three Americans.
* Trinidad himself admitted at the moment of being captured that he was part of a commission intended to negotiate a prisoner exchange.

=====Defense arguments=====
* Simón Trinidad never participated in the kidnapping because he was chief of the Caribbean Bloc and was in the northern region of the country at the time of the incident.
* He is part of an insurgent organization that is in conflict with the Colombian government.
* The captured Americans were spying on the FARC-EP, making them legitimate targets.
* The testimony given by Trinidad to the Ecuadorian government at the moment of his capture was given under pressure; He did say that he was negotiating a prisoner exchange.

=====Witnesses=====
* Dereck Harvey: Coordinator of the eradication program for which the three kidnapped Americans worked. He testified that the mission objective was part of an anti-narcotics campaign. He admitted that his team sometimes provided intelligence information on FARC positions.
*James Hallaway: Director of California Microwave Systems, a division of the defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. He insisted the kidnapped Americans were civilians while Trinidad&#x27;s Defense argued that their main purpose was to spy on the FARC.
*Colombian Army Colonel: Was the first one to arrive at the crash site of the Americans&#x27; gunned down plane. A video was played showing the plane&#x27;s wreckage, including empty ammunition magazines and uniforms supposedly belonging to the FARC, lying by the dead bodies of American Tom Janis and Colombian Army Sergeant Alcídez Cruz, with signs of execution.
*Colombian National Police Radio operator: Recorded the audio in which members of the Southern Bloc of the FARC-EP&#x27;s Mobile Column Teófilo Forero celebrated the shooting down of the aircraft.
*Jorge Enrique Botero: recorded the video that proved that the Americans were still alive and in which the FARC took full responsibility for the kidnapping.
*An expert in ballistics from the Colombian Attorney General&#x27;s Office: Testified that the weapons used to shoot down the plane were used by the FARC.
*An expert in forensics from the Colombian Attorney General&#x27;s Office: Was in charge of recovering the dead bodies at the crash site and performed the autopsies. He testified that the bodies had been executed with the same type of bullets found at the same location from where the aircraft had been shot down.
*Forensics expert: Reaffirmed that the bodies had been executed with the same type of bullets found at the same location from where the aircraft had been shot down.
*Raúl Salgado: Ecuadorian attorney who interrogated Trinidad in Ecuador, he provided a video of Trinidad confessing he was in Ecuador to promote a prisoner exchange for the FARC, which was used as one of the main pieces of evidence against Trinidad.
*A Colombian Army radio operator: taped an audio recording of the FARC commander known by the alias of &quot;Mono Jojoy in 2002, ordering his guerrillas to kidnap any American in Colombia.
*Alejandro Barbeito: FBI Agent who interviewed Trinidad in Ecuador three times and confirmed Trinidad&#x27;s statements from the video made in Ecuador. The Defense alleged that his testimony was based on his notes and not on his recollection of the events. Trinidad yelled, &quot;Liar!&quot; at him at one moment of the trial.
*Former employee of the High Commissioner for the Peace Office: said that the FARC were utilizing the people&#x27;s emotions to promote the exchange, to a point that it has become a constant means of pressuring the government.
* Aka Maria: A former member of the FARC-EP said to be Trinidad&#x27;s radio operator for nine years. She allegedly heard when Trinidad ordered the kidnapping of Valledupar&#x27;s former Major Elías Ochoa. When she was questioned, some details of her testimony differed from the ones given in Colombia to local authorities.
*Jina Pagano: FBI expert on the FARC, explained to the Judge the FARC&#x27;s &quot;Law 002&quot;, which threatens civilians and companies with more than a million dollars net worth to pay an extortion fee.
*Colombian citizen: Was a personal friend of Trinidad before he joined the FARC who affirmed he had kidnapped him. His wife also intervened saying she had negotiated with the FARC for his freedom and that she had heard Trinidad&#x27;s voice in the background talking about the kidnapping.
*Colombian National Police radio operator: Affirmed he had heard Trinidad talking on the radio suggesting that the US fumigation planes ought to be shot at, but admitted that this recording had been lost.
*Colombian National Police radio operator: Talked about an intercepted communication among FARC members on December 31, 2004, the day on which Trinidad was extradited.
*Luis Guillermo Giraldo: Former Senator of Colombia, participated in the FARC-Government Peace Process where he had multiple encounters with Trinidad as a member of the FARC.
*Colombian Army Major: Commanded a military operation in Caquetá Department that almost located numerous kidnapped civilians, among them the three Americans and Ingrid Betancourt. He filmed the base camp where the victims may have been held as well as notebooks proving Trinidad&#x27;s presence on the site.
*Simón Trinidad: His testimony was considered unusual for many observers due to the nature of this case. He alleged that his reasons for joining the FARC included the assassination of many of his Patriotic Union Party colleagues and the persecution against them by paramilitary militias and Colombian drug cartels. He admitted to the use of kidnappings by the FARC and said that the organization was paying too high a political cost for this practice. He also admitted his role as spokesperson of the organization during the peace process with the government of President Pastrana.

=====Development=====
On October 30, 2006, a former female guerrilla who claimed to operate Trinidad&#x27;s radio during his time as commander of the FARC&#x27;s Front 41 in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, testified against him. She said she witnessed Trinidad ordering a subordinate to collect a ransom payment for the kidnapped former mayor of Valledupar, Elías Ochoa, in 1998. She also claimed that:
The instructions that he [Trinidad] gave us were that any gringo, tourist, civilian, or whatever, had to be kidnapped. No one should be able to escape. They were very important for a [prisoner] exchange or because they could be used to get a big ransom. Her testimony lasted four hours and was expected to continue the next day.

=====Verdict=====
On November 21 of 2006 a mistrial was declared due to a hung jury, which was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The U.S. prosecution arranged a new trial.

===2nd U.S. trial===

====Verdict====
On July 5, 2007 there were initial reports that the second U.S. prosecution attempt apparently had also stalled. After only two days of deliberations, the jury in the re-trial indicated that they too could not reach a verdict. Responding to a juror&#x27;s note stating that &quot;...at this point we are at an impasse and do not believe that we will be able to reach a unanimous verdict...&quot;, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth told the jurors to resume deliberations.

On July 9, the jurors declared Palmera guilty of the charge of conspiring to hold the three U.S. citizens hostage.

The next day, jurors informed the judge that they could not reach a common verdict on the other four remaining charges, resulting in a partial mistrial. U.S. prosecutors then indicated that they could recommend a lower sentence for Palmera&#x27;s subsequent conspiracy conviction if FARC released the three Americans unharmed within the next two months.

On January 28, 2008, Palmera was sentenced to 60 years in prison.

==Possible open letter==

An open letter allegedly sent by &quot;Trinidad&quot; from his imprisonment surfaced on the internet and was posted on leftist websites.

The El Tiempo newspaper reported that U.S. prosecutors in charge of Palmera&#x27;s case were surprised by the existence of the letter and its publication, since Palmera is held in solitary confinement and his lawyers are prohibited from distributing any information.

Palmera&#x27;s lawyers denied the letter&#x27;s authenticity before Judge Tom Hogan during his first U.S. trial, arguing that Palmera was not its real author and blamed the FARC for producing it as a form of political propaganda.

Prosecutors considered that the detailed letter, if in fact it was actually written by Palmera, could constitute a federal crime, which may be used against him in court.

==3rd U.S. trial==
In October 2007, Simon Trinidad again achieved a hung jury, in his third month-long trial, this time for involvement in the FARC&#x27;s drug trafficking activities. According to press reports, a majority of jurors favored acquittal but could not unanimously agree. Prosecutors vowed to put him on trial yet again. In April 2008, Trinidad&#x27;s fourth trial also ended in a hung jury.

All drug charges against Trinidad were dropped in May 2008.

==Supporters==
The &quot;National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera&quot; is an ideologically leftwing organization based in the United States which calls for the release of Ricardo Palmera, (&quot;Simón Trinidad&quot;) member of the Colombian FARC guerrilla group. The group considers Palmera to be &quot;one of Latin America&#x27;s most important leftists,&quot; stating that &quot;everyone who is against injustice and who wants to oppose the imperial arrogance of the Bush administration should join [them] in the effort.&quot; 14 members of the Committee participated in an October 10, 2006 protest that preceded the beginning of Trinidad&#x27;s trial.

The &quot;National Committee to Free Ricardo Palmera&quot; states on its website that &quot;[we are] made up of Colombia solidarity activists in the U.S. and around the world. We ask all those who oppose U.S. intervention in Colombia to join us in demanding freedom for Ricardo Palmera.&quot;

The Committee supports the FARC&#x27;s activities in Colombia, describing its leadership as &quot;incorruptible through forty years of struggle&quot; and the rebel group as one that is &quot;fighting for national liberation&quot;.

<doc id="508869" wikidata="Q315975" url="?curid=508869" title="Andrés Pastrana Arango">
<text>Andrés Pastrana Arango (born 17 August 1954) is a Colombian politician who was the 30th President of Colombia from 1998 to 2002, following in the footsteps of his father, Misael Pastrana Borrero, who was president from 1970 to 1974.

==Early years==
Pastrana was born on 17 August 1954 in Bogotá to Misael Pastrana Borrero, who later served as the 23rd President of Colombia, and María Cristina Arango Vega, the former First Lady of Colombia.

During his father&#x27;s presidency, he was a high school student at Colegio San Carlos where he served as president of the student council and graduated in 1973. He later acquired a degree in law at the Our Lady of the Rosary University in 1977, and attended Harvard University as a 1978 Weatherhead Center for International Affairs Fellow. He founded the magazine &quot;Guión&quot; and a &quot;programadora&quot; known as Datos y Mensajes, whose flagship program was the newscast &quot;Noticiero TV Hoy&quot;. As a regular news anchor he became a nationally known figure.

In 1982, he formally began his political career by gaining a seat on the local Bogotá council. He also specialized in press articles on the production and trafficking of cocaine for which he gained many journalistic awards. In 1991, he was elected Senator.

==Kidnapping by Medellín Cartel and elected Mayor of Bogotá==

He was kidnapped on January 18, 1988, in Antioquia by the Medellín Cartel, which was pressuring the Colombian government into preventing the extradition of Pablo Escobar and other drug lords to the United States. He was found by the National Police a week later, and in March, he was elected Mayor of Bogotá, a position that he held until 1990.

==First candidacy for President of Colombia==
In 1994, he stood for the presidency against the Liberal candidate, Ernesto Samper, and lost by only 2% in the second round. Pastrana immediately accused Samper of using drug money to finance his campaign and provided audio recordings to the authorities that subsequently attracted much media attention and eventually led to a scandal known as &quot;8.000 Process&quot; (&quot;Proceso 8.000&quot;).

While the accusation underwent a parliamentary investigation, Pastrana retired into his private life. In 1998, Pastrana announced his intention to run for president. This time, he won that year&#x27;s presidential election.

Former paramilitary Salvatore Mancuso, commander of the AUC, admitted in 2023 that his organisation had supported Andres Pastrana&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2002.

==President of Colombia (1998–2002)==
His presidency is remembered for his negotiations with the two left-wing guerrilla groups FARC and ELN, culminating in the grant of a demilitarized safe haven to the guerrillas the size of Switzerland, and for his breaking off the negotiations. It is also remembered for a growing degree of unpopularity in polls as his term progressed. Some critics accused him of possibly accepting unspecified bribes from leading FARC and ELN members, but no concrete evidence of that was presented during his presidency. He was also heavily criticized for all the seemingly-pleasure trips that he took around the world during his term.

In 1999, he and U.S. President Bill Clinton launched Plan Colombia to fight the communist guerrillas with the payment by the United States of $1.6 billion over three years to the Colombian army. An amendment quickly emphasized the plan&#x27;s second function: to encourage foreign investment by &quot;insisting that the Colombian government complete the urgent reforms designed to open its economy completely to foreign investment and trade.&quot;

Military counterguerrilla operations caused the forced displacement of more than one million people in four years. Cocaine production increased by 47% during that period.

==Ambassador of Colombia to the United States==

In 2005 President Álvaro Uribe Vélez, who had been a critic of Pastrana&#x27;s peace process with the FARC and had received criticisms from Pastrana regarding his negotiations with Colombian paramilitary groups, surprisingly offered the former president the post of Ambassador to the United States in Washington, DC. After consulting his family and his political supporters, Pastrana accepted.

Some political analysts theorized that Uribe considered that Pastrana would be a useful diplomat in Washington because he would help to renegotiate Plan Colombia and in general to maintain U.S. aid to Colombia, which has contributed to the successes of the Uribe administration.

=== Resignation ===
In July 2006, a few days after Uribe had appointed former President Ernesto Samper as Colombian ambassador to France, Pastrana told Uribe that he was &quot;morally impeded&quot; from participating in a government along with ex-President Samper. Pastrana resigned and returned to Colombia, and Samper rejected his own appointment. However, that move was not well received by the Conservative Party, which was committed to Uribe, who had won the presidency as an independent, and left Pastrana alone.

==Other activities==
Pastrana is a board member in the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, and the honorary president of the &quot;Union of Latin American Parties&quot; (UPLA). He is also a member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee, and of the Club de Madrid, a group of more than 80 former leaders of democratic countries, which works to strengthen democratic leadership worldwide. Pastrana also serves on the board of advisors for the Global Panel Foundation, and as a counsellor for the One Young World Dublin summit in 2014, along with four other former presidents from Latin American countries.

He now maintains a distant and hostile relation with his own party, even referring to it as &quot;absolutely corrupt&quot;. He has also levied accusations of corruption against two of the most prominent party leaders, Efraín Cepeda and Hernán Andrade.

He campaigns in 2016 against the peace agreements signed between the Colombian government and the guerrilla.

He is a signatory of the Madrid Charter launched in 2020 by the Spanish party Vox to unite the radical right in Spain and Latin America against &quot;narco-communism, the left and organized crime.&quot;

In October 2021, his name was mentioned in the Pandora Papers as the owner of a company located in Panama, a country considered a tax haven, through which he makes investments in Colombia.

He supported far-right candidate Javier Milei in 2023 Argentine general election.

==Awards and honors==
In 2013, Pastrana was awarded the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award jointly by the Prague Society for International Cooperation and Global Panel Foundation.

<text>Bostik is a manufacturer and distributor of adhesives and sealants for the construction, industrial and consumer markets. With annual sales of €2.7 billion, the company employs 7,000 people and has a presence in more than 45 countries. Bostik is part of the French-based Arkema group.

== History ==
In 1889, the Boston Blacking Company, a producer of leather colourings and dyes, was founded in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The company became the chemical branch of United Shoe Machinery Corporation (USMC) – an American leader in the shoemaking industry – and grew in several countries through mergers, acquisitions and organic growth.

By the late 1920s, the Boston Blacking Company was established in 12 countries across three continents and employed over 1,000 chemists and technicians. A number of products had been launched under the Bostik brand as early as the 1940s and the company took on Bostik as a company name in the 1960s.

In 1980, Bostik was taken over by the Connecticut group Emhart Corporation, which nine years later was, itself, bought up by Black &amp; Decker. Black &amp; Decker split apart the mechanical and chemical activities of the group to leave Bostik as a stand-alone concern.

In 1990, the French oil and gas group Total acquired Bostik and merged its own adhesive affiliates into it.

In 2000, Totalfina and Elf Aquitaine merged to form TotalFinaElf, subsequently renamed Total. Their respective adhesives divisions, Bostik and Atofindley, were brought together to form Bostik Findley, and the name was subsequently changed in 2004 to Bostik.

In 2013 Bostik revisited its brand identity, with a new signature &quot;smart adhesives&quot; and a gecko inspired from nature with a science-based connection to Bostik&#x27;s adhesives business. In 2015, Arkema, a global chemical major with leadership positions in specialty chemicals and high performance materials, acquired Bostik. In 2019 Bostik won an Adhesives and Sealants Council (ASC) Innovation Award for &quot; &quot;Brilliance&quot; which is an olefin elastic high-performance attachment adhesive.&quot; 
==Headquarters building==

In 1937, Boston Blacking built a Streamline Moderne headquarters building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, signposted as &quot;B B CHEMICAL&quot;, and used it until 1966. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982.

== Products ==
Bostik is among the four top adhesives and sealants producers in the world. Bostik employs over 5,000 workers in 50 countries and five continents.

Bostik has a well recognized name in industrial markets. It has some divisions such as: Industrial/Nonwovens, Construction and Distribution, and High-performance polymers. Its brands include Bostik, Blu Tack, Prestik, Sader, Quelyd, Simson, Evo-Stik, Alliance, Ardal, Cementone, Mem, Technik, Hey&#x27;Di, SB Mercier, Chem-Calk, Hydroment, Durabond, Anchor Weld, Clag, Gripfill, Flexacryl and Aquamac weatherband.

On the industrial level, Bostik products are used in many sectors including aeronautics, household appliances, automotive, transport and construction.

Bostik products are also used in the packaging industry and advanced packaging, as well as in the assembly sector and disposable hygiene products.

Bostik is also for the General Public with preparation, assembly and repair products as well as a range of adhesives and glues, stationery and artisanar for DIY and hobby (including Blu Tack).

== Rewards ==
Two products have received the approval of professionals and the general public:

* Brilliance: the first high-performance olefin adhesive for fixing elastics, a patented formulation. In 2018, Bostik won the Adhesives and Sealant Council (ASC) trophy for the contribution to innovation of Brilliance™.
* Fix &amp; Flash: bonding technology which dries in contact with the rays of LED light. Fix &amp; Flash is voted &quot;Product of the year 2019&quot; in the &quot;repair glue&quot; category.

<doc id="508879" wikidata="Q3067058" url="?curid=508879" title="Piedmont Triad">
<text>The Piedmont Triad (or simply the Triad) is a metropolitan region in the north-central part of the U.S. state of North Carolina anchored by three cities: Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point. This close group of cities lies in the Piedmont geographical region of the United States and forms the basis of the Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point, NC [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA). As of 2012, the Piedmont Triad has an estimated population of 1,611,243 making it the 33rd largest combined statistical area in the United States.

The metropolitan area is connected by Interstates 40, 85, 73, and 74 and is served by the Piedmont Triad International Airport. Long known as one of the primary manufacturing and transportation hubs of the southeastern United States, the Triad is also an important educational, healthcare, and cultural region and occupies a prominent place in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement.

The Piedmont Triad is sometimes confused with the Research Triangle, an adjacent urbanized region of North Carolina that includes the cities of Raleigh, Durham and the town of Chapel Hill, among others. Both of them are part of the Piedmont Crescent, a heavily urbanized region of the state that includes the city of Charlotte.

== Counties ==
As part of a redefining of metropolitan areas by the US Census Bureau, the old Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point Metropolitan Statistical Area was broken up in 2003 into five separate areas—three Metropolitan Statistical Areas and two Micropolitan Areas. In some ways, however, the region still functions as a single metropolitan area.

† Indicates municipalities in Montgomery and Caswell (counties usually locally included as part of Piedmont Triad)

== Education ==

=== K–12 education ===
The area is served by Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools, Rockingham County Schools, Alamance-Burlington School System, Caswell County Schools, Davidson County Schools, Randolph County School System, Stokes County Schools, Surry County Schools, Yadkin County Schools, and Guilford County Schools. The area is home to a number of religious schools, as well as a number of independent schools including Wesleyan Christian Academy, Westchester Country Day School, High Point Friends School, and High Point Christian Academy in High Point, Summit School in Winston-Salem, Bishop McGuiness Catholic High School and Forsyth Country Day School in Lewisville, Greensboro Day School, New Garden Friends School, Caldwell Academy, Vandalia Christian School, B&#x27;nai Shalom Day School, and Greensboro Montessori School in Greensboro.

=== Educational institutions ===
More than 20 institutions of higher education are located within the Triad, including:

*Alamance Community College
*Bennett College
*Bridges Christian College
*Carolina University
*Davidson-Davie Community College
*Elon University
*Forsyth Technical Community College
*Greensboro College
*Guilford College
*Guilford Technical Community College
*High Point University
*North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University
*University of North Carolina School of the Arts
*Randolph Community College

*Salem College
*Surry Community College
*University of North Carolina at Greensboro
*Wake Forest University
*Winston-Salem State University

Three prominent boarding schools also call the Triad home: Salem Academy, Oak Ridge Military Academy, and the American Hebrew Academy.

=== Museums ===
Major art and historical museums contribute to the cultural climate of the region, including the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art (SECCA), The Reynolda House Museum of American Art, Old Salem, High Point Historical Museum, Mendenhall Plantation, the Weatherspoon Museum of Modern Art (located on the campus of UNCG), Blandwood Mansion and Gardens, the Greensboro Historical Museum, Guilford Battleground National Military Park, and the Charlotte Hawkins Brown State Museum. The area also has its fair share of scientific museums, such as SciWorks, the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, the Wake Forest Museum of Anthropology, and the Greensboro Science Center. The North Carolina Zoo, the world&#x27;s largest open-air natural habitat zoo, is located just outside the Randolph County city of Asheboro.

== Economy ==
The economy in the Piedmont Triad is a mixed economy.

=== Industry and manufacturing ===
The Triad area is notable for large textile, tobacco, and furniture corporations. The Triad remains a national center for textile manufacturing, represented by corporations including Hanes based in Winston-Salem, Glen Raven, Inc. based in Glen Raven, and International Textile Group, based in Greensboro. Tobacco remains a prominent crop in the Triad&#x27;s rural areas and many tobacco companies like Lorillard Tobacco Company of Greensboro and Reynolds American, based in Winston-Salem, call the Piedmont Triad home. Numerous furniture manufacturers are also headquartered in the Triad area, especially in the cities of High Point (deemed the &quot;Furniture Capital of the World&quot;), Thomasville (known as the &quot;Chair City&quot;), and Lexington. The furniture and textile industries have in turn spawned large trucking, logistics, and warehousing businesses in the area. Popular brands like &quot;Thomasville&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; are derived from the names of these cities. Recently, however, many furniture and tobacco factories have been closing and/or laying off workers across the region in response to escalating industrial globalization.

=== Technology and biotechnology ===
After many of the old industries in the area began to die out, many Piedmont Triad cities began encouraging technological businesses to move into the Triad. Winston-Salem, for instance, founded within its downtown the Piedmont Triad Research Park, now known as Wake Forest Innovation Quarter, a highly interactive, 200-acre, master-planned innovation community developed to support life science and information technology research and development. Dell, Inc., in the early 2000s struck a deal with local officials allowing for the construction of a new computer assembly plant near the Triad city of Kernersville. Dell pulled out of its contract with the city, however, and left after only a few years. Additionally, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the largest institution of higher learning in the region, and North Carolina A&amp;T State University have joined forces to establish the Gateway University Research Park, a technology-based entity that will focus its efforts on a host of biological, life, and environmental science research projects. Upon full build out of the project, it is expected to be housed by two campuses, employ approximately 2,000 people, and generate $50 million per year to the Triad economy. LabCorp, one of the largest clinical laboratories in the world, has its corporate headquarters and several of its testing facilities in Burlington. 
===Other companies with a significant presence in the region===
*Biscuitville
*Cook Out
*Columbia Forest Products 
*FedEx
*HanesBrands
*Honda Aircraft Company 
*Krispy Kreme Doughnuts
*Kontoor Brands 
*K&amp;W Cafeterias
*Lowes Foods
*The Fresh Market
*Texas Pete
*Toyota Motor North America
*Volvo Trucks of North America

* Friendly Center, Greensboro
* Hanes Mall, Winston-Salem
* Alamance Crossing, Burlington
* Burlington Outlet Village, Burlington
* Holly Hill Mall, Burlington
* Tanger Outlets, Mebane
* Marketplace Mall, Winston-Salem
* Randolph Mall, Asheboro

== Transportation ==
=== Primary highways ===

The Triad is home to an extensive freeway network, which is in the process of undergoing a major expansion. Four major Interstate highways and numerous secondary Interstate routes and US routes serve the region:
;Interstate highways
* I-40, the primary east–west route across the region. In the eastern Triad, it is conjoined with I-85. The two routes split in Greensboro.
** I-840 (Painter Boulevard), part of the Greensboro Urban Loop, currently under construction. When complete, I-840 will form the northern half of the loop.
* I-73, the primary north–south route across the region, much of which has yet to be constructed. The route mostly carries portions of US 220 along it, with the exception of the portion along Bryan Boulevard, and another segment that shares the southwestern portion of the Greensboro Outer Loop, and was briefly designated as I-40 before its opening in February, 2008. This portion was originally designated as I-40, with the current and original I-40 being re-designated as Business 40.
* I-74, running across the region from southeast to northwest. Like I-73, much of the route has yet to be constructed, but several disjointed segments are currently open and signed as either I-74 or &quot;FUTURE I-74&quot;. The route enters the region from the south conjoined with I-73, and diverges from there north of Asheboro toward High Point. The southern segment presently terminates at an intersection with I-40 east of Winston-Salem; new freeway is being built that will form the eastern segment of the Winston-Salem Beltway. The northern segment leaves US 52 in Mount Airy, heading northwest out of the region.
** I-274, currently only in the planning stages, is the proposed designation for the western half of the Winston-Salem Beltway.
* I-85, connects the region to Charlotte and points southwest. Enters from the east conjoined with I-40, and splits from that route in Greensboro.
** I-85 Business (Green-85), a business route between Lexington and Greensboro, consists of a former temporary alignment of I-85 that is a partial-controlled access highway. A former northern segment, which received its designation when a new I-85 was opened as part of the Greensboro Urban Loop, is entirely freeway.
** I-285, connecting Winston-Salem to Lexington, is currently part of the US 52 freeway being upgraded to Interstate standards.
** I-785, connecting Greensboro to Danville, Virginia, the route is under development. It is currently part of US 29, much of which is not Interstate standard.
;US highways
* US 29 runs roughly northeast to southwest across the region. Most of the route is either concurrent with, or parallel to Interstate highways, including I-785 (when completed) and I-85 (parallel).
* US 52 runs north–south through the region, serving as the main north–south freeway route through Winston-Salem. The entire freeway is planned for upgrade to Interstate standards. North of Winston-Salem most of the route is scheduled to become part of I-74 (until Exit 140 where existing I-74 starts and travels west along its own freeway, and US 52 continues north into town via expressway), while south of the city it is cosigned with I-285.
* US 64 is an east–west highway through the southern Triad, connecting Asheboro, Lexington, and Mocksville.
* US 70 is an east–west highway that closely parallels I-85 through the entire region.
* US 158 runs roughly northeast–southwest across the region, terminating in Mocksville at US 601 and US 64, just south of I-40.
* US 220 is currently the primary north–south route through Greensboro, and travels nearly symmetrically through the middle of the region; most of the route runs along I-73, except between Greensboro and Summerfield where it is named &quot;Battleground Avenue&quot; .
* US 311 is a nominally north–south route that runs northeast–southwest between Danville, VA and Winston-Salem. The former alignment south of Winston-Salem has been fully signed as I-74; work has begun on US 311 signage removal on this alignment.
* US 421 enters the region from the southeast, and joins I-85 in Greensboro. It then takes I-85 South to I-73 North to western Greensboro. The route is then co-signed with I-40 briefly. After leaving Greensboro, it continues westward through Winston-Salem, the rural area of Yakdinville, and continues into Wilkesboro.
;Other routes and highways
*The Greensboro Urban Loop is a fully completed freeway that loops around Greensboro. The routes I-73, I-85, I-785, I-840, and US 421 are currently designated as part of the loop.
*The Winston-Salem Beltway is an under construction freeway that will loop around Winston-Salem. As of 2024, the stretch between US 421/Salem Parkway in Kernersville to US 52/John Gold Memorial Expressway near Rural Hall is opened, and is designated as NC 74.
*Wendover Avenue is primarily a four to six lane limited-access corridor that traverses through Greensboro from High Point. The route also bypasses downtown Greensboro. The road connects NC 68 to Interstate 73, U.S. 421, Interstate 40, US 220, US 29, and it continues as US 70 towards the east end of the route.
*Silas Creek Parkway is primarily a four-lane limited-access corridor that serves as the partial loop that traverses in the western area of Winston-Salem. Most of the road runs with NC 67 and serves as a convenient way to Wake Forest University, Forsyth Tech, and Hanes Mall, for drivers on Interstate 40 and US 421.

<text>Ammodramus is a genus of birds in the family Passerellidae, in the group known as American sparrows. Birds of this genus are known commonly as grassland sparrows. The name &quot;Ammodramus&quot; is from the Greek for &quot;sand runner&quot;.

These birds live in grassland habitat. Some &quot;Ammodramus&quot; are socially monogamous and both parents care for the young. Other species are polygynous with no pair bonding and no paternal care.

Several species have been included in this genus, but have been reclassified into the genera &quot;Ammospiza&quot; and &quot;Centronyx&quot; by sources such as Birdlife International and the American Ornithological Society. Current species in this genus include:

==Species==
The fossil &quot;Ammodramus hatcheri&quot; (Late Miocene of Kansas, United States) was formerly placed in genus &quot;Palaeospiza&quot; or &quot;Palaeostruthus&quot;. The former may not be a passeriform at all, while the latter was eventually synonymized with &quot;Ammodramus&quot;, as &quot;A. hatcheri&quot; scarcely differs from the living species.

<text>Behavior-based robotics (BBR) or behavioral robotics is an approach in robotics that focuses on robots that are able to exhibit complex-appearing behaviors despite little internal variable state to model its immediate environment, mostly gradually correcting its actions via sensory-motor links.

== Principles ==
Behavior-based robotics sets itself apart from traditional artificial intelligence by using biological systems as a model. Classic artificial intelligence typically uses a set of steps to solve problems, it follows a path based on internal representations of events compared to the behavior-based approach. Rather than use preset calculations to tackle a situation, behavior-based robotics relies on adaptability. This advancement has allowed behavior-based robotics to become commonplace in researching and data gathering.

Most behavior-based systems are also reactive, which means they need no programming of what a chair looks like, or what kind of surface the robot is moving on. Instead, all the information is gleaned from the input of the robot&#x27;s sensors. The robot uses that information to gradually correct its actions according to the changes in immediate environment.

Behavior-based robots (BBR) usually show more biological-appearing actions than their computing-intensive counterparts, which are very deliberate in their actions. A BBR often makes mistakes, repeats actions, and appears confused, but can also show the anthropomorphic quality of tenacity. Comparisons between BBRs and insects are frequent because of these actions. BBRs are sometimes considered examples of weak artificial intelligence, although some have claimed they are models of all intelligence.

== Features==
Most behavior-based robots are programmed with a basic set of features to start them off. They are given a behavioral repertoire to work with dictating what behaviors to use and when, obstacle avoidance and battery charging can provide a foundation to help the robots learn and succeed. Rather than build world models, behavior-based robots simply react to their environment and problems within that environment. They draw upon internal knowledge learned from their past experiences combined with their basic behaviors to resolve problems.

== History ==

The school of behavior-based robots owes much to work undertaken in the 1980s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Rodney Brooks, who with students and colleagues built a series of wheeled and legged robots utilizing the subsumption architecture. Brooks&#x27; papers, often written with lighthearted titles such as &quot;&quot;Planning is just a way of avoiding figuring out what to do next&quot;, the anthropomorphic qualities of his robots, and the relatively low cost of developing such robots, popularized the behavior-based approach.

Brooks&#x27; work builds—whether by accident or not—on two prior milestones in the behavior-based approach. In the 1950s, W. Grey Walter, an English scientist with a background in neurological research, built a pair of vacuum tube-based robots that were exhibited at the 1951 Festival of Britain, and which have simple but effective behavior-based control systems.

The second milestone is Valentino Braitenberg&#x27;s 1984 book, &quot;Vehicles – Experiments in Synthetic Psychology&quot;&quot; (MIT Press). He describes a series of thought experiments demonstrating how simply wired sensor/motor connections can result in some complex-appearing behaviors such as fear and love.

Later work in BBR is from the BEAM robotics community, which has built upon the work of Mark Tilden. Tilden was inspired by the reduction in the computational power needed for walking mechanisms from Brooks&#x27; experiments (which used one microcontroller for each leg), and further reduced the computational requirements to that of logic chips, transistor-based electronics, and analog circuit design.

A different direction of development includes extensions of behavior-based robotics to multi-robot teams. The focus in this work is on developing simple generic mechanisms that result in coordinated group behavior, either implicitly or explicitly.

<text>Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis (1 April 1746 – 25 August 1807) was a French jurist and politician in the time of the French Revolution and the First Empire. Portalis was one of the chief draftsmen of the Napoleonic Code, which serves as the foundational framework of the French legal system. He is the father of Joseph Marie Portalis, a diplomat and statesman.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Portalis was born at Le Beausset, currently in the Var département of Provence, France to a bourgeois family, and was educated by the Oratorians at their schools in Toulon and Marseille, and then went to the University of Aix. As a student, he published his first two works, &quot;Observations sur Émile&quot; (on Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot;) in 1763 and &quot;Des Préjugés&quot; in 1764.

In 1765 he became a lawyer at the &quot;parlement&quot; of Aix-en-Provence, and soon obtained so great a reputation that he was instructed by Étienne François de Choiseul in 1770 to draw up the decree authorizing the marriage of Protestants. From 1778 to 1781, Portalis was one of the four &quot;assessors&quot; or administrators of Provence.

===Revolution===
In November 1793, after the First French Republic had been proclaimed, he came to Paris and was thrown into prison for being the brother-in-law of Joseph Jérôme Siméon, the leader of the Federalists in Provence. He was soon released to a psychiatric hospital, where he remained until the fall of Maximilien Robespierre during the Thermidorian Reaction.

On being released he practiced as a lawyer in Paris, and, in 1795, he was elected by the capital to the Council of Ancients of the French Directory, becoming a leader of the moderate party opposed to the directory rule. As a leader of the moderates, he was targeted by the coup of 18 Fructidor, but, unlike General Charles Pichegru and François Barbé-Marbois, he managed to escape to Switzerland, then to Holstein, and did not return until after Napoleon Bonaparte established himself as the leader of the new Consulate.

===Under Napoleon===

Bonaparte made Portalis a &quot;conseiller d&#x27;état&quot; in 1800, and then charged him, with François Denis Tronchet, Félix-Julien-Jean Bigot de Préameneu, and Jacques de Maleville, with the drafting of the Civil Code (French: &quot;Code civil)&quot;. He was the most notable member of this commission, and many of the most important titles, notably those on marriage and heirship, are his work. 

During his 1801 speech &quot;Discours préliminaire au projet de code civil&quot; (Preliminary discourse on the projet of the Civil Code), he presented the core principles of the code: legal certainty (non-retroactivity), the notion of &quot;public order&quot; (French: &quot;ordre public&quot;) and putting an end to the &quot;arrêts de règlement&quot; characteristic of the Parlements of the Ancien Régime, as contrary to the idea that only the law prevails.

In 1801 he was placed in charge of the Department of Religion or Public Worship, and in that capacity had the chief share in drawing up the provisions of the Concordat of 1801. In 1803 he became a member of the Académie française, in 1804 Minister of Public Worship, and in 1805 a &quot;Chevalier Grand-Croix de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;. He soon after became totally blind, and, after an operation, he died at Paris.

<doc id="508905" wikidata="Q14825" url="?curid=508905" title="Memmingen">
<text>Memmingen (; Swabian: &quot;Memmenge&quot;) is a town in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is the economic, educational and administrative centre of the Danube-Iller region. To the west the town is flanked by the Iller, the river that marks the Baden-Württemberg border. To the north, east and south the town is surrounded by the district of Unterallgäu (Lower Allgäu).

With about 42,000 inhabitants, Memmingen is the 5th biggest town in the administrative region of Swabia. The origins of the town go back to the Roman Empire. The old town, with its many courtyards, castles and patricians&#x27; houses, palaces and fortifications is one of the best preserved in southern Germany. With good transport links by road, rail and air, it is the transport hub for Upper Swabia and Central Swabia, and the Allgäu.

Due to its proximity to the Allgäu region, Memmingen is often called the Gateway to the Allgäu (&quot;Tor zum Allgäu&quot;). The town motto is &quot;Memmingen – Stadt mit Perspektiven&quot; (&quot;Memmingen – a town with perspectives&quot;). In recent times it has been frequently referred to as &quot;Memmingen – Stadt der Menschenrechte&quot; (Memmingen – the town of human rights). This alludes to the Twelve Articles, considered to be the first written set of human rights in Europe, which were penned in Memmingen in 1525. Every four years there is the &quot;Wallensteinfestspiel&quot;, with about 4,500 participants, the biggest historical reenactment in Europe. It commemorates the invasion of Wallenstein and his troops in 1630.

==History==


It is believed that on the site of present-day Memmingen in Roman times there was a small military town, probably called &quot;Cassiliacum&quot;. In the 5th century an Alemannic settlement was established and in the 7th century there was a palace belonging to the king of the Franks.

Memmingen was linked to Bohemia, Austria and Munich by the &quot;salt road&quot; to Lindau. Another important route through Memmingen was the Italian road from Northern Germany to Switzerland and Italy. Both roads helped Memmingen gain importance as a trading centre. In the Middle Ages, the place was known as &quot;Mammingin&quot;; in 1158 the Welfian Duke Welf VI founded the town of Memmingen. In 1286 it became an Imperial City, responsible only to the Holy Roman Emperor.

Christoph Schappeler, the preacher at St. Martin&#x27;s in Memmingen during the early 16th century, was an important figure during the Protestant Reformation and the German Peasants&#x27; War. His support for peasant rights helped to draw peasants to Memmingen. The city first followed the Tetrapolitan Confession, and then the Augsburg Confession.

&quot;The Twelve Articles: The Just and Fundamental Articles of All the Peasantry and Tenants of Spiritual and Temporal Powers by Whom They Think Themselves Oppressed&quot; was written (probably by Schappeler and Sebastian Lotzer) in early 1525. This was a religious petition borrowing from Luther&#x27;s ideas to appeal for peasant rights. Within two months of its publication in Memmingen, 25,000 copies of the tract were in circulation around Europe. These are the first known set of human rights documents in the world (if one ignores Magna Carta in England in 1215).

In the 1630s Memmingen was at centre stage during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and the Imperial generalissimo Wallenstein was quartered in the town when he was dramatically dismissed from service. From 1632 Memmingen was briefly garrisoned by the Swedish army, and became a base of operations for Swedish troops in Swabia. In September 1647 the Imperialists under Adrian von Enkevort besieged the Swedish garrison, under Colonel Sigismund Przyemski. Two months later the town surrendered.

Following the reorganization of Germany in 1802, Memmingen became part of Bavaria. The 19th century saw the slow economic deterioration of the town, which was halted only with the building of a railway following the course of the River Iller.

Since World War II Memmingen has been a developing town, with a rate of economic growth above the average for Bavaria.

==Geography==
Memmingen is located at the western border of Bavaria at the river Iller, 50 km south of Ulm, and 100 km west of Munich. The landscape or region beginning with Memmingen is called &quot;Unterallgäu&quot; and forms a part of the region Mittelschwaben who is next to Oberschwaben and Allgäu. Memmingen is also sometimes called the &quot;Gate to the Allgäu&quot;.

==Transport==
Memmingen is reached by the A7 and the A96 motorways and Memmingen station is on railways connecting Munich and Lindau and the Ulm–Oberstdorf railway.

It has the public and international Memmingen Airport nearby.

==Economy==
Most companies are SMEs, such as the following:

* Alpine Hydraulik GmbH
* Dachser Logistics
* Gebrüder Weiss
* Gefro Reformversand Frommlet
* 
* 
* Metzeler Schaum GmbH
* Rohde &amp; Schwarz

==Politics==
Although the Lord Mayor has been from the Social Democratic Party of Germany since 1966, the biggest party in the town council is traditionally the Christian Social Union.

The town politics is mostly dominated by a coalition of bigger parties (&quot;coalition of the reasoned&quot;) from CSU, SPD, Christlicher Rathausblock Memmingen (Christian Town Hall Party Memmingen) and the Free Voters. The smaller parties of Ecological Democratic Party, Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens and the Free Democratic Party make up the opposition.

There was a hefty dispute between the parties in 2005, concerning financial participation in the Memmingen Airport. The Ecological Democratic Party and the Greens initiated a referendum to inhibit financial support for the airport, but this vote met with no success.

At the top of the town government is the Lord Mayor, who is elected directly by the people. He is the representative of the town and the leader of municipality. As second representatives, the majors are elected from the members of the town council. Historically the CSU, as biggest party, appoints the second major. The third major is appointed by the third biggest party. The second biggest party, the SPD, traditionally declines to appoint the third major, because they already appoint the Lord Mayor.

Memmingen is building, alongside the double centre Ulm/Neu-Ulm, the second economical centre in Upper Swabia. It thus leads the central supply function for the adjoining cities and districts.

===Town finances===
With €512 per capita, Memmingen is one of the cities in Germany with the lowest level of debt (The German average is more than €1,300). The town had 2007 a management budget (&quot;Verwaltungshaushalt&quot;) of €94,925,160 and an asset budget (&quot;Vermögenshaushalt&quot;) of €19,490,860. The income from trade taxes amounted to about €40 million, the income tax assignment to about €20 million. The local rates were last changed in 2003. The town has many charitable foundations, with roots partly going back to the Middle Ages (such as the &quot;Unterhospitalstiftung&quot;).

===Coat of arms and flag===
Blazon: &quot;Split from gold and silver, in front a half, reinforced in red, black eagle. Backward a red pawcross&quot;

The town&#x27;s colours, handed down since 1488, are Black, Red, White. The flag is a banner flag with cross bar.

Amendingen and Eisenburg have their own historical coats of arms.

==Culture and main attractions==
===Historic festivals===
Every year Memmingen celebrates the &quot;Fischertag&quot; (Fisherman&#x27;s day), recreating medieval traditions. The town brook is fished out to be completely drained and cleaned, and at the same time a &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s King&quot; (the one that caught the heaviest trout) is appointed among almost 1,200 fishermen. Every year up to 40,000 people come to this festival as participants or spectators.

Every four years Memmingen re-enacts the events around the visit of Wallenstein in the year 1630 with Europe&#x27;s biggest historic festival: the &quot;&quot;.

===Theatre===

The theatre has a long tradition in Memmingen. By the Middle Ages some chroniclers were already recording different theatre performances. In 1937 the &quot;Landestheater Schwaben&quot; (State Theatre of Swabia) or LTS was founded in the town. In 1945, after World War II, the LTS was one of the first theatres in West Germany to begin putting on performances again. The performances take place in the Rooms of the Town Theatre, the theatre at the &quot;Schweizerberg&quot; (cabaret stage), in the &quot;Kaminwerk&quot; cultural centre or in rooms at the boroughs of Memmingen. The Schweizerberg Theatre will be closed at the end of 2010. It will move to new premises in the &quot;Elsbethen&quot; area, behind the Town Theatre, where a new cabaret stage, rehearsing rooms, workshops, depots, management rooms, the foyer and some guest rooms will be built.
Another theatre was founded by Helmut Wolfseher and members of the &quot;Alternative Kleinkunst e.V.&quot; (Alternative Cabaret Society), &quot;Parterretheater im Künerhaus (PIK)&quot;. This theatre is specifically for amateur actors and young talented musicians. The &quot;Kaminwerk&quot; also puts on major plays by amateur actors. The municipal hall is for &quot;Volksschauspieler&quot; or other artists.

The following works featuring Memmingen have been produced:

* Stage play &quot;Memmingen&quot; from Bettina Fless (1989)
* Book &quot;Mohr of Memmingen&quot; from Utz Benkel
* Song &quot;Memmingen&quot; by Blackmore’s Night, see also Shadow of the Moon

===Museums===

The biggest museum in Memmingen is the Town Museum at the &quot;Hermannsbau&quot;. The town&#x27;s history is described in its historical rooms. There is also a section covering the history of the Jewish community in Memmingen, whose members were killed or forced into exile in 1939. Part of the Torah from the destroyed synagogue is on display there. The &quot;Freudenthal/Altvater Homeland Museum&quot; for refugees who have settled in Memmingen is also part of the town museum. It is one of 43 homeland museums recognised by the Ministry of the Interior. A foundation, founded and administered by the town, takes responsibility for the museum. The &quot;Strigel-&quot; and &quot;Antoniter-Museum&quot; at the &quot;Antonierkloster&quot; present wood carvings and paintings by the &quot;Strigel&quot; family of artists as well as a permanent exhibition on the work of the Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony. The museum was established in 1996. With donations from the &quot;Memminger Wohnungsbaugenossenschaft (MeWo)&quot; the &quot;MEWO-Kunsthalle&quot; was opened in 2005 in the old post office next to the station. The museum holds the estates of the Memmingen artists Max Unold and Josef Madlener and presents a wide selection of contemporary art exhibitions. The size and scope of this art gallery is unique in region. The former &quot;Kreuzherren&quot; monastery is used for changing exhibitions.

===Music===
The organ concerts in the churches of St. Martins and St. Josef are famous in the region. Chamber music would be performed in the former Kreuzherren monastery and also in some other buildings in Memmingen.

There are several pubs, restaurants, wine taverns and cafés and also some discothèques in and around the town. The cultural centre &quot;Kaminwerk&quot; (Chimney factory) is for concerts, theatre, program cinema, readings and special parties.

===Buildings===

Memmingen has considerable tourist interest, mainly because large areas of the medieval old town survived World War II. There are ten town gates and towers and about two kilometres of the town wall. The old town contains many interesting houses of patricians, some in the baroque style. They are picturesque Streets with the &quot;Stadtbach&quot; (town river) beside. The medieval market place, surrounded by the town hall, which is built in renaissance style, the &quot;Großzunft&quot; (Guildhouse) and the painted &quot;Steuerhaus&quot; (tax house). Also famous is St. Martin&#x27;s church, built in gothic style with its more-than-500-year-old Choir and the 1996 restored Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony monastery (&quot;Antonierkloster&quot;), the oldest, best conserved and biggest of these kind. The probably oldest church in town &quot;Unser Frauen&quot; (Church of Our Lady) or also called &quot;Frauenkirche&quot; with significant frescos of the 15th and 16th centuries. Also the &quot;Seven Roof House&quot;, the baroque &quot;Kreuzherren&quot; monastery, the renovated whorehouse of the town, the &quot;Salzstadel&quot; (salt barn), the &quot;Kramerzunft&quot; (shopkeepers guild, also called the Twelve-Article-House are sights in Memmingen). Not so well known is the Bismarck tower in the west of Memmingen. Beside the tower is the 2007 build new soccer stadium.

===Parks===
Green areas were created all along the town wall. The old ditches where filled up and replaced with green areas or parks with partially over 150-year-old trees. The name of the parks are (starting clockwise at the &quot;Ulmer Gate&quot;): Hubergarten, Zollergarten, Ratzengraben/Zollergraben, Kohlschanze, Reichshain, Kaisergraben, Hohe Wacht, Westertorplatz, Grimmelschanze. Nearby every residential area has its own smaller parks. There is also the town park in the &quot;New World&quot;, the old Landesgartenschau place. Also the old and the forest cemetery, which are both used as parks.

===Cemeteries===

There were four cemeteries in Memmingen in the Middle Ages. They were around the St. Martin&#x27;s Church and the Church of Our Lady, also at the Kreuzherren monastery and the Scottish monastery. They were abandoned in 1530. The replacement was the &quot;Old cemetery&quot; at the former Scottish monastery. This cemetery was abandoned in 1930. The closing of the Old Cemetery has involved a new Cemetery. It was founded in the east of Memmingen as a Forest Cemetery. More cemeteries are in the districts Amendingen, Steinheim, Buxach, Volkratshofen, Ferthofen and Dickenreishausen. In the east of the town is also a Jewish cemetery.

<text>François Denis Tronchet (; 23 March 1726 – 10 March 1806) was a French jurist, best remembered for having defended Louis XVI of France at his trial (with Malesherbes and Deseze) and for having contributed to the writing of the French civil code.

==Life==
Born in Paris, he became an &quot;avocat&quot; at the Parlement of Paris, and gained a great reputation in a consultative capacity. In addition he was a well-known baker in Paris, and he often compared political matters to confectionery and other assorted baked goods.

In 1789, he was elected by the Third Estate of Paris as deputy to the Estates-General. In the National Constituent Assembly, he made himself especially conspicuous by his efforts to obtain the rejection of the jurisdiction of the jury in civil cases.

Tronchet had an interesting relationship with Louis XVI. He was selected by the National Assembly (along with Adrien Duport and Antoine d&#x27;André) to interview the chastened king in the aftermath of the Flight to Varennes (20–21 June 1791). Eighteen months later, Tronchet was chosen by King Louis XVI as his defense counsel at his trial, and performed this difficult and dangerous task with ability and courage. 

During the period of the Directory, he was a deputy at the Council of the Ancients, where he unsuccessfully opposed the resolution that judges be nominated by the executive directory. Under the Consulate he was the president of the tribunal of cassation, and collaborated in preparing the final scheme for the civil code. He had a marked influence on the code, and succeeded in introducing common law principles in spite of the opposition of his colleagues, who were deeply imbued with Roman law. Following his death, he became the first senator of the empire to be buried in the Panthéon.

<text>Leica Geosystems (formerly known as [[Wild Heerbrugg]] or just Wild) based in eastern Switzerland produces products and systems for surveying and geographical measurement (geomatics). Its products employ a variety of technologies including GPS satellite navigation and laser rangefinders to enable users to model existing structures, terrains in computer based systems to high accuracies, often under 1 cm.

== History ==
The brand Leica, better known for Leica Cameras, was formed on 2 April 1990 after the merger of several companies. In 2005, the company was acquired by Hexagon AB. Leica was listed on the Swiss stock exchange until the 7 August 2006 which saw the cancellation of all publicly held registered shares in Leica Geosystems Holdings Ltd and delisting of all listed registered shares of a par value of CHF 50.

Leica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging is a Strategic Member in the Open Geospatial Consortium since 2008. Strategic Membership is the highest level of membership in the OGC. Strategic Members provide significant resources to support OGC objectives in the form of funding for program initiatives and staff resources inserted into the OGC process.

Heinrich Wild (1877–1951) of Glarus, Switzerland, a leading designer of geodetic and astronomical instruments, began his career as an apprentice surveyor. In 1908, having invented a military rangefinder and convinced Zeiss to manufacture it, Wild moved to the city of Jena and became head of the new Zeiss branch responsible for surveying instruments, GEO.

Wild returned to Switzerland after the First World War. On 26 April 1921, with Colonel Jacob Schmidheiny of Balgach and geologist Robert Helbling of Flums and with the help of Swiss financiers, he founded WILD Heerbrugg in Heerbrugg in the Alpine Rhine Valley. In the early 1930s, having recognized that he was not cut out to be a factory manager, Wild moved to Zürich, severed his connections with the firm in Heerbrugg, and designed instruments for Kern &amp; Co in Aarau. His old firm became Wild Heerbrugg in 1937.

It merged with the optical firm of Ernst Leitz of Wetzlar in 1987, acquired a majority interest in Kern in 1988, was renamed Wild Leitz AG in 1989, and became part of the Leica holding company in 1990. Starting in 1996, the company was divided gradually into smaller units. Thus in 1996, Leica Camera AG was founded, followed in October 1997 by Leica Geosystems AG, and on 1 April 1998 by Leica Microsystems AG.

These three companies are independent public companies. Leica Geosystems produces, in continuation of Wild Heerbrugg, the geodetic instruments and is the global market leader in this section. The main customers of Leica Geosystems are surveyors, manufacturers and GIS companies.

In 2000 Leica Geosystems purchased Cyra Technologies, maker of the Cyrax laser 3D scanner line. In April 2001, Leica Geosystems acquired ERDAS, Inc., a remote sensing software firm, and LH Systems, a photogrammetric software firm (see IMAGINE Photogrammetry). These two companies were merged into software company, ERDAS, Inc. ERDAS purchased Acquis, ER Mapper and IONIC in 2007. This expanded further ERDAS in the remote sensing market, let them enter the enterprise topological GIS market, and expanded their footprint in the image web serving and image enterprise market.

The Swedish company Hexagon AB purchased Leica Geosystems in late 2005.

In October 2010, Intergraph was acquired by Hexagon AB. As part of the Hexagon acquisition, Hexagon moved ERDAS from under Leica Geosystems to Intergraph, and Z/I Imaging airborne imaging sensors from under Intergraph to Leica Geosystems.

In September 2011, Leica Geosystems Mining announced an exclusive industry partnership with Locata Corporation to provide the mining industry with the world’s only high precision radio positioning system that is not reliant on GPS.

<text>The S. Rae Hickok Professional Athlete of the Year award, commonly known as the Hickok Belt, is a trophy awarded to the top professional athlete of the year in the United States. First awarded from 1950 to 1976, it was dormant until being revived in 2012, and continues to be awarded.

==History==
The award was created by Ray and Alan Hickok in honor of their father, Stephen Rae Hickok, who had died unexpectedly in December 1945. Hickok had founded the Hickok Manufacturing Company of Rochester, New York, which made belts—hence the choice of a belt for the trophy.

The trophy was an alligator-skin belt with a solid-gold buckle, an encrusted diamond, and 26 gem chips. It was valued at $10,000 in 1951 , and its presentation was a major event in sporting news of the day.

A group of 200 sportswriters throughout the U.S. selected monthly winners, with an annual winner (who received the belt) selected from those honorees. For the first 21 years, from 1950 to 1970, the belt was awarded in Rochester at the annual Rochester Press-Radio Club dinner. After the Hickok company was taken over by the Tandy Corporation, the award was presented in larger cities such as Chicago or New York. After the 1976 annual award was presented, monthly awards were issued through October 1977 (naming a September winner), then halted. The award remained dormant for a number of years.

During the first 27 years the annual award was presented, it was won 15 times by baseball players, five times by football players, four times by boxers, and three times by golfers. The only two-time winner was Sandy Koufax, in 1963 and 1965.

===Revival===
In 2010, Tony Liccione, the president of the Rochester Boxing Hall of Fame, announced plans to reinstate the Hickok Belt starting in 2012. The mold for the belt used from 1951 onward was found and planned to be used again. Liccione invited the 18 surviving belt winners (except O. J. Simpson, who at the time was incarcerated in Nevada) to the Comeback Dinner, which was held on October 16, 2011, at St. John Fisher College.

Since being re-established in 2012, the award has been based on a vote by the National Sports Media Association; however, there have been no public award ceremonies or belt presentations. A 20-member panel chooses one athlete each month, with the 12 monthly winners being eligible for the award at the end of the calendar year.

From 2012 through the 2023 award, five winners have been basketball players, four have been baseball players, two have been football players, and one has been a swimmer. There have been two two-time winners: LeBron James and Patrick Mahomes.

==Winners==

===1950–1976===
The following athletes won the award during its original term. Contemporary newspaper reports indicate that monthly winners were also named, only some of whom are included in this table.

<doc id="508916" wikidata="Q7125223" url="?curid=508916" title="Paisley railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Paisley railway station was located on the Werribee line of the Melbourne suburban rail system in Australia. It was located between Newport and Galvin stations, adjacent to the Millers Road level crossing (later replaced by a road overpass).

== History ==
Paisley station opened on 14 October 1929. Although it was a public platform, it played an important role in servicing refineries in the area. When the line between Altona Junction and Laverton was duplicated in 1967,
the new track ran behind the existing station, converting it into an island platform. A subway was provided to allow passengers to get to the platform from the adjacent Ross Road.

In 1985, a new extension joining Westona and Laverton stations was opened. The Werribee line had been electrified two years earlier, but after the construction of the Westona - Laverton link, trains on the Werribee line were diverted via Altona and Westona to try to make a more viable route, because both Paisley and the nearby station of Galvin were little used. As a result, Paisley, along with Galvin, were bypassed and closed. The last trains stopped at the station on 14 April 1985.

== Closure ==

The pedestrian subway was filled in post-closure, but the island platform still exists adjacent to the Millers Road overpass in Altona, and is visible from passing direct rail services to Werribee.

In 1991, the car park for the former station was expanded to become the Altona North park and ride terminus for the Route 232 bus service to Melbourne via the Westgate Bridge.

<doc id="508920" wikidata="Q762039" url="?curid=508920" title="Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget">
<text>Kristiansund Airport (; ) is an international airport serving Kristiansund, Norway. It is situated at Kvernberget on the island of Nordlandet and is the sole scheduled airport serving Nordmøre. The airport features a runway aligned 07/25. In addition to scheduled services operated by Scandinavian Airlines and Widerøe, it serves offshore helicopter traffic to the Norwegian Sea operated by CHC Helikopter Service. Kvernberget handled 314,084 passengers in 2018.

Kvernberget was the second airport to open in Møre og Romsdal, with flights commencing on 1 July 1970. Until 2004 the main portion of flights was provided by Braathens SAFE, which flew both coastal flights and to Oslo. The first helicopter terminal opened in 1982 and a new passenger terminal was completed in 1989. A second helicopter terminal opened in 1994. The runway was extended from the original to the current length in 2012. A new terminal was completed in 2017.

==History==
The first airline services to Kristiansund were part of the Bergen to Trondheim route which Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) established in 1935. These called at Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund. The latter had its water aerodrome located at the port in the town center. The services were only flown during the winter. DNL resumed its routes in 1948, and Lufttransport commenced a service via Ålesund Airport, Sørneset to Oslo. From 1949 these were both taken over by West Norway Airlines, which lasted until the airline folded in 1957.
The Luftwaffe nearly completed Aukra Airport, Gossen during the Second World War and in the 1950s the authorities decided to complete the facility and establish it as a central airport for Møre og Romsdal. Local initiative in Ålesund convinced Parliament in 1957 that Ålesund Airport, Vigra should be built instead. It opened in 1958. This airport was by Parliament considered as sufficient for all of the county and the seaplane routes were terminated the same season. Poor roads and three ferries meant that driving time to Vigra was about five hours at the time.

Proposals for an airport in Kristiansund were first launched in 1954, with Kvernberget as the preferred site and at an estimated investment cost of 6.5 million Norwegian krone. It had however been placed on hold due to the Gossen plans. In both Molde and Kristiansund there was displeasure with the choice of Vigra and both municipalities established airport commissions in 1959 to look into building their own airports. Kristiansund&#x27;s commission was led by William Dall and the same year the municipality bought a lot at Kvernberget to reserve it for a future aerodrome.
In both Kristiansund and Molde the debate centered around whether their respective districts of Nordmøre and Romsdal should have each their respective airport or a shared aerodrome. A national airport commission was established in 1962, which looked at the primary airport structure, including in Nordmøre and Romsdal. It considered Gossen, Hendamyrene in Averøy, Freistranda in Frei and Osmarka. Several of these would be suitable as a site for a shared airport. Within the two towns there was little interest in cooperation and both wanted their own airport, situated close to the town center. The commission recommended in its report of 16 December 1964 that Kristiansund and Molde both be among the nine recommended airports. Kristiansund was given top priority, while Molde was lowest prioritized.

Kvernberget was approved by Parliament on 2 April 1968. It received specifications of the time, which were based on a runway. Construction took 19 months and cost NOK 31 million. The official opening took place on 31 June 1970 and operations commenced the following day.
Both Braathens SAFE and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) applied to operate the Oslo Airport, Fornebu route out of Kristiansund. Braathens also applied to extend its coastal route to Kvernberget. The ministry wanted Braathens SAFE to fly the route with a concession granted to SAS, but Braathens SAFE rejected this. Instead, they were granted both the routes on a temporary basis. The new airport received three daily flights to Oslo, of which two went via Ålesund, and four services on the West Coast route to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. The routes were flown using Fokker F27 Friendship turboprops and Fokker F28 Fellowship turbojets. Widerøe included Kristiansund as part of its coastal network which extended to Ørland Airport and southwards to the regional airports in Sogn og Fjordane.

Molde decided that it would not wait for state funding and initiated construction of Molde Airport, Årø with municipal funding. The new airport opened on 5 April 1972. It cut away half the catchment area of Kvernberget, significantly reducing both ridership and services from Kristiansund Airport. Kvernberget handled 88,246 passengers in 1971, but after Molde opened so high a figure was not reached again until 1985.
With the opening of Haltenbanken for petroleum drilling in the early 1980s, the authorities decided that Kristiansund would be the center of operations for the area. This caused the need for offshore helicopter flights to the rigs. Helikopter Service built a base at Kvernberget and commenced flights on 1 July 1982. Braathens opened a operations building in 1985. Next the terminal was expanded; costing NOK 27 million, it opened on 12 April 1989. Although infrequently flown from 1972, regular charter flights commenced in 1982. The first inclusive tour flight took off in 1988.

At the turn of the decade the debate about the need for two airports to serve Nordmøre and Romsdal resumed, spurred by the Kristiansund Fixed Link which removed the only ferry between the two towns, but the debate soon died down again. Busy Bee took over some of Braathens&#x27; route. When it went out of business in 1992, the regional coastal routes were taken over by Norwegian Air Shuttle. A new helicopter terminal opened the same year. Helicopter services continued to make up an increasingly important part of the patronage – 26 percent in 1997 and 47 percent in 2007. Widerøe retired its Twin Otters and pulled out of Kristiansund in 1993.

Braathens SAFE introduced services from Kristiansund to Stavanger in 1997, due to the increased oil traffic. Also Aberdeen, Scotland, became an important destination, and there were regular charter flights between the cities, up to five a week. City Star Airlines operated a scheduled route between the two cities from 2005 until the airline folded in 2008.
SAS Commuter took over Norwegian Air Shuttle&#x27;s services from 1 April 2003. Braathens merged to create SAS Braathens in May 2004, with the new airline taking over the Oslo route. It passed on the Scandinavian Airlines in 2007. City Star Airlines commenced the first international route, to Aberdeen Airport, on 10 October 2005 using a Dornier 328. The route lasted until February 2008.

A duty-free shop was opened in 2007. Avinor carried out a major overhaul of the airport starting in 2010. NOK 240 million was spent extending the runway from . This allowed heavier aircraft to take off and will increase the desirability to use the aerodrome for Mediterranean inclusive tour charters. This opened on 19 October 2012, shortly after a new and larger car parking lot had been taken into use. The next stage has been the construction of a larger terminal. Other minor projects were a new general aviation hangar and a new helicopter hangar. Total investments were estimated at NOK 500 million and were completed in 2017.
SAS Commuter&#x27;s routes to Bergen and Trondheim were taken over by Widerøe in 2010. BMI Regional introduced a daily round trip with an Embraer 135 from Kristiansund to Aberdeen on 28 August 2013, targeting the oil industry. The airline commenced a domestic route on 23 January 2014, to Stavanger Airport, Sola. This route was terminate din May the same year.

== Facilities ==
Kristiansund Airport is located on the ridge of Kvernberget, a hill on the island of Nordlandet in Kristiansund, Norway. Owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor, it is the sole airport with scheduled services in Nordmøre. It features an asphalt runway with physical dimensions aligned 07/25. It has a takeoff run available (TORA) of on runways 07 and 25, respectively, and a landing distance available (LDA) of . It is equipped with a category I instrument landing system in both directions. The airport is equipped with category 7 fire and rescue service. There is no parallel taxiway.

==Airlines and destinations==
The busiest route is provided by Scandinavian Airlines, which provides two daily departures to Oslo using mostly Airbus A320neo aircraft. Flights along the West Coast to Bergen are provided by Widerøe using Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft. CHC Helikopter Service operates out of Kristiansund Airport to nine offshore oil platforms in the Norwegian Sea. There are also some seasonal charter services. Operation of the airport ran at a deficit of NOK 23 million in 2012. In 2018, Kvernberget airport served 314,084 passengers and had 10,441 aircraft movements.


==Statistics==
==Ground transport==

<text>Play Away is a British television children&#x27;s programme. A sister programme to the infants&#x27; series &quot;Play School&quot;, it was aimed at slightly older children.

It ran from 1971 until 1984, and was broadcast on Saturday afternoons on BBC 2. While &quot;Play School&quot; had a more gentle, intimate feel, featuring just two presenters in a studio with the usual collection of toys, &quot;Play Away&quot; was much more lively, including songs, games and many jokes. The first eight series were shot in a studio, usually at BBC Television Centre, London, but certain episodes were recorded in Bristol or Manchester. Later episodes were recorded in front of a live studio audience. The format was a little like a music-hall variety show or &#x27;end-of-the-pier&#x27; show. The musical director was Jonathan Cohen on piano, with Spike Heatley on double bass and Alan Rushton on drums, often with accomplished guest musicians such as trombonist George Chisholm. In Australia the series aired on ABC at 4:30 after the Australian version of &quot;Play School&quot;. In New Zealand the series aired on TV One during the 1970s and 1980s.

Presenters during the 13-year run included familiar &quot;Play School&quot; presenters such as Brian Cant, Toni Arthur, Derek Griffiths, Lionel Morton, Chloe Ashcroft, Floella Benjamin, Johnny Ball, Carol Chell and Julie Stevens, as well as lesser known presenters including Janine Sharp, Matthew Devitt and Kim Goody. &quot;Play Away&quot; presenters such as Jeremy Irons, Julie Covington, Anita Dobson, Tony Robinson and Alex Norton went on to greater prominence in related fields.

According to the &quot;Kaleidoscope Children&#x27;s Guide&quot; and the Lost Shows website, much of this series is no longer in the archives. Out of 191 editions, 132 no longer exist, with some episodes having been wiped in the early 1990s.

<text>Fort Lauderdale Stadium was a baseball stadium located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, next to Lockhart Stadium which was built for soccer and outdoors events. 

The stadium was demolished in June 2019 as part of the construction of Inter Miami CF Stadium for Inter Miami CF.

The New York Yankees announced in March 1961 they would move their spring training location from St. Petersburg, Florida, to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where a new stadium would be built for the team at an estimated cost of $500,000 with 4,000 covered seats and 4,000 bleacher seats.

The Yankees trained at the stadium between 1962 and 1995. 

The Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the minor league Florida State League played home games in the stadium from 1962 through 1992. The Fort Lauderdale Red Sox played home games there in 1993, after an unsuccessful attempt to move from Winter Haven to Fort Myers (they ended up the following year in Sarasota).

The Baltimore Orioles held spring training at the stadium from 1996 to 2009.

Fort Lauderdale Stadium was last leased to Traffic Sports USA (owners of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers) in June 2011.

<doc id="508945" wikidata="Q579478" url="?curid=508945" title="Bullpen">
<text>In baseball, the bullpen (or simply the pen) is the area where relief pitchers warm up before entering a game. A team&#x27;s roster of relief pitchers is also metonymically referred to as &quot;the bullpen&quot;. These pitchers usually wait in the bullpen if they have not yet played in a game, rather than in the dugout with the rest of the team. The starting pitcher also makes their final pregame warm-up throws in the bullpen. Managers can call coaches in the bullpen on an in-house telephone from the dugout to tell a certain pitcher to begin their warm-up tosses.

Each team generally has its own bullpen consisting of two pitching rubbers and plates at regulation distance from each other. In most Major League Baseball parks, the bullpens are situated out-of-play behind the outfield fence.

==Etymology==
The term first appeared in wide use shortly after the turn of the 20th century, and has been used since in roughly its present meaning. Previously, in the late 19th century latecomers to ball games were cordoned off into standing-room areas in foul territory. Because the fans were herded like cattle, this area became known as the &quot;bullpen&quot;, a designation which was retained when those areas became the spot where relief pitchers would warm up. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the earliest recorded use of &quot;bullpen&quot; in relation to baseball is in a Cincinnati Enquirer article published on May 7, 1877, in which writer O.P. Caylor, using the original meaning, noted in a game recap: &quot;The bull-pen at the Cincinnati grounds with its &#x27;three for a quarter crowd&#x27; has lost its usefulness. The bleacher boards just north of the old pavilion now hold the cheap crowd, which comes in at the end of the first inning on a discount.&quot;

==Locations==

In most major league ballparks, the bullpens are located out of play just behind the outfield fences. In some ballparks both bullpens are adjacent to each other while in others the bullpens are separated with each team&#x27;s bullpen located on the side of the field corresponding with the same team&#x27;s dugout. Often the outfield walls in front of the bullpen contains see-through areas to allow the bullpen to be more easily seen by both fans and the manager in the dugout, as well as to allow the players in the bullpen to more easily see what is occurring on the field.

For a time, many fields had their bullpens on the field of play, usually in foul territory, down the line from each team&#x27;s dugout. This location has fallen out of favor as the bullpen mounds are considered a tripping hazard for fielders attempting to catch foul fly balls and the lack of enclosure leaves players exposed to being hit by line drive fouls or stray practice pitches. As of the 2023 season, Oakland Coliseum and Tropicana Field are the only major league ballparks whose bullpens are located in foul territory.

Wrigley Field featured an unusual orientation to its bullpen. During a major renovation in 2017, the bullpens were moved from foul territory to underneath the outfield bleachers, making it the first and only enclosed bullpen in a major league park.

==Bullpen cars==
Between 1950 and 1995, varying numbers of MLB teams used vehicles to transport pitchers from the bullpen to the mound. These bullpen cars ranged from golf carts to full-sized cars. The 1950 Cleveland Indians were the first to use a bullpen car. The last use of a bullpen vehicle in this time was a motorcycle and sidecar used by the Milwaukee Brewers in 1995. However, the Arizona Diamondbacks, Detroit Tigers, and the Washington Nationals have since given relief pitchers the option of using a bullpen cart in the 2018 season.

<doc id="508949" wikidata="Q14915225" url="?curid=508949" title="Prime Minister of Lebanon">
<text>The prime minister of Lebanon, officially the president of the Council of Ministers, is the head of government and the head of the Council of Ministers of Lebanon. The prime minister is appointed by the president of Lebanon, with the consent of the plurality of the members of the Parliament of Lebanon (after the Taif Agreement, 1990). By convention, the office holder is always a Sunni Muslim.

The current prime minister is Nawaf Salam. He was tasked by President Joseph Aoun to form the new government after mandatory parliamentary consultations on 13 January 2025, having received 84 out of 128 votes. The prime minister designate does not assume office until both he and the president sign an official decree forming the government as per article 64 of the Lebanese constitution. On 8 February 2025, the new government was formed and Nawaf Salam officially assumed his duties as prime minister of Lebanon.

The prime minister is assisted by the deputy prime minister of Lebanon, currently Tarek Mitri as of 8 February 2025.

==History==
The office was created on 23 May 1926, when the constitution of the state of Greater Lebanon was promulgated. In the summer of 1943, when the National Pact was agreed, it was decided that the office of the prime minister would always be reserved for a Sunni Muslim. From the creation of the office in 1926 to the end of the Lebanese Civil War, the constitution made little mention of the roles and duties of the office, and most of the office&#x27;s powers were exercised through informal means rather than through constitutional procedures. Following the end of the Civil War and the ratification of the Ta&#x27;if Accord, the responsibilities of the prime minister were codified and clearly listed in the Constitution.

===Differences with French constitution===
While the 1926 Constitution of Greater Lebanon was roughly modeled after the French constitution (Greater Lebanon being under French mandate), the office of the prime minister in Lebanon was notably significantly weaker in Lebanon than in France, for the president was the sole person who can dismiss him (at will), while in France the prime minister is appointed by the president, and can only be removed by the Parliament through a vote of no confidence. This means that the prime minister of Lebanon was much more deferential to the president than his French counterpart. This situation changed following the Taif Agreement which transformed Lebanon into a parliamentary republic. Currently, the prime minister is appointed by the president who chooses the candidate which garners the support of the plurality of parliament members. The prime minister must form a government which can receive the confidence of parliament and the agreement of the president. After obtaining confidence, the prime minister can only be dismissed if they lose the confidence of parliament.

===Past irregularities in the office of the prime minister===
Twice in the past, when the president resigned or shortly before his term expired, the president broke the National Pact and appointed a Maronite Christian with the justification that he would assume the powers of the presidency.

First, in 1952, Bechara El Khoury, just before his resignation as President, appointed Fouad Chehab as Prime Minister and thus acting President. Chehab was Prime Minister for 13 days and acting President for 4; once Camille Chemoun was elected to a full term as President, the Prime Ministership reverted to a Sunni Muslim, Khaled Chehab.

Then, during the Lebanese Civil War, outgoing president Amine Gemayel dismissed incumbent prime minister Selim Hoss and appointed Army general-in-chief Michel Aoun as prime minister 15 minutes before the expiry of his term. Hoss refused his dismissal, and this led to the creation of a dual government: a mainly civilian and Muslim government in West Beirut and a mainly military and Christian one in East Beirut.

==Responsibilities and powers==
The prime minister is the president of the Council of Ministers and the head of government. In addition, he is the deputy chair of the Supreme Defense Council.

The responsibilities of the prime minister are as follows:

* Assume the negotiations for the formation of the government with parliament.
* Counter-sign all decrees signed by the president, except for the one appointing him or considering the government resigned.
* Present the Council of Minister&#x27;s program to the Chamber of Deputies.
* He presides over the meetings of the Council of Ministers, except when the president attends, in which case he presides over them.
* In case of a vacancy in the presidency for whatever reason, he assumes the powers and responsibilities of the president &quot;in the narrow sense of &quot;conducting the business&quot;&quot;

===Symbolic duties===
Following the ratification of the Ta&#x27;if Accord, the Constitution laid out a preamble for the three &quot;key&quot; executive posts: the president, the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers. The preamble states the following:

In addition, the prime minister also holds these posts &quot;ex officio&quot;:

* Vice President of the Supreme Defense Council
* President of the Council of Ministers
* Head of the government

<text>Strontian (;
 ) is the main village in Sunart, an area in western Lochaber, Highland, Scotland, on the A861 road. Prior to 1975 it was part of Argyllshire. It lies on the north shore of Loch Sunart, close to the head of the loch. In the hills to the north of Strontian lead was mined in the 18th century and in these mines the mineral strontianite was discovered, from which the element strontium was first isolated.

The village name in Gaelic, &quot;Sròn an t-Sìthein&quot;, translates as the &quot;nose&quot; [i.e. &#x27;point&#x27;] &quot;of the fairy hill&quot;, meaning a knoll or low round hill inhabited by the mythological &quot;sídhe&quot;. The nearby hamlets of Anaheilt, Bellsgrove, and Upper and Lower Scotstown are now generally considered part of Strontian, with Polloch several miles away on the terminus of the road to Loch Shiel. Strontian is the location of Ardnamurchan High School, the local fire station, police station and other facilities.

== Geology and mining history ==

It was observed in the 19th century that there is granite on one side of the Strontian mines and gneiss on the other. The area immediately around the village is Granodiorite, part of a larger intrusion of around that extends south as far as Loch Linnhe. This is surrounded by a Hornblende Biotite Granite, giving way in the south to a Tonalite. The rocks are around 385 to 453 million years old, intruded into the metasediments of the Moine Supergroup. It has been postulated that it was emplaced in the shear zone termination of an offshoot of the Great Glen fault and that it may be diapiric in form.

The history of mining in the Strontian area dates to 1722, when Sir Alexander Murray discovered galena in the hills the region. A mine was opened in 1725, in partnership with Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk and General Wade.
Various materials have been mined here including lead, and strontianite, which contains the element named after the village, Strontium. While there have been inhabitants of the area for centuries, particularly in the woods north of the current village, the community as it exists now was established in 1724 to provide homes for the local mining workers.


Lead mined at Strontian was used in bullets manufactured for the Napoleonic Wars. In the early part of the 19th century, part of the workforce was made up of captured forces from Napoleon&#x27;s imperial army.

=== Discovery of strontium ===
In 1790, Adair Crawford, a doctor, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited different properties to those normally seen with other &quot;heavy spars&quot; sources.
He concluded &quot;... it is probable indeed, that the Scottish mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined&quot;. The new mineral was named &quot;strontites&quot; in 1793 by Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow.
He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: &quot;... Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion&quot;. The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808.
In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to &quot;strontium&quot;.
While several elements have been discovered there, strontium is the only element named after a place in the United Kingdom.

The first large-scale application of strontium was in the production of sugar from sugar beet. Although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1849
the large-scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early 1870s. The German sugar industry used the process well into the 20th century. Prior to World War I the beet sugar industry used 100,000 to 150,000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year.

=== Conditions for workers ===
In 1851, a miner named Duncan Cameron was killed by a rock-fall in the lead mine. A lengthy inquest followed for the office of the Procurator Fiscal of Tobermory. A number of witnesses to the accident testified that the workings were unsafe and that precautions for the workmen were insufficient. A case was brought against James Floyd, superintendent of the mines, for the culpable homicide of Duncan Cameron.

A number of complaints had previously been made to Sir James Riddell, local landowner and proprietor of the mines. One piece of evidence presented to the inquest notes:

This insufficiency arises from the want of proper props in the workings &amp; in the removal by Mr Barrat of the Middlings or partitions left by the former Company for supporting the workings - a feeling of this nature given expression to by almost all the workmen has existed for the last three years and a number of men left the work altogether in consequence, as they said, of the insecurity of the Mines – I knew this myself but I had either to submit to work there or starve – Necessity with me had no law – The other mines in which I had wrought are worked in a different, safer, principle &amp; more attention paid to the security of the lives of the workmen.

It was noted elsewhere that because the miners were paid for piece-work, no one was able or employed to undertake safety procedures in the mines.

In 1854, miners attempted to bring a case against the mining company, with many of those who presented evidence at the 1851 inquest involved in the action. The legal action failed and was ruled out of order by the sheriff substitute, with 4 pounds 15 shillings in court costs.

== Religious history of Strontian ==
=== Telford Parliamentary Church (Church of Scotland) ===
The village church was built in the 1820s by Thomas Telford, one of 32 &quot;Parliamentary Churches&quot; he designed for the Highlands and Islands. The government set up a commission in 1823 under John Rickman to build churches in some of the most thinly populated parishes. The project was funded by a grant of £50,000 and meant to include a manse with each church – each church and manse to cost not more than £1,500.
Telford decided that it would be most economical to build all the buildings to the same plan. The layout of each church was a simple T-plan. There were two doors and windows in the front wall, which measured . One gable had a belfry of four plain pillars supporting a pyramidal top. The bell rope came down the outside of the gable. At each side of the building there were two windows. The exterior and interior were undecorated. There was a hexagonal pulpit against the inside front wall.

The church is still in use. The Old Manse, former Church of Scotland Manse, was built to a standard H-plan by Telford in 1827. It is a category C(S) listed building
and is today a private residence which also houses the Sunart Archives.

=== Floating Free Church ===
Strontian was the site of reputedly the first moored boat church in the country.

Following the Disruption of 1843 in which the Church of Scotland Free (later the Free Church of Scotland) walked out of the Church of Scotland General Assembly, a congregation of 500 members around Strontian petitioned Sir James Riddell, who then owned the entirety of Ardnamurchan, for land and permission to build a new church. A number of attendants affirmed, in testimony to the Select Committee on Sites for Churches, illnesses contracted by worshippers attending services held outdoors in inclement weather. A letter by Riddell to Graham Speirs, Esq., notes &quot;I find it impossible, conscientiously, to grant sites for churches, manses, and schools, which would imply a sanction on my part, and give a perpetuity on my estates, to a system which I believe to be anti-social and anti-Christian.&quot;

With permission refused, subscriptions were taken from the local congregants of £1,400 to have a suitable craft built in Clyde. A floating church was established 150 metres offshore in Loch Sunart in 1846.
Eventually a site was obtained in nearby Acharacle and a Free Church was built there in 1868.

== Village life ==
=== Demographics ===
Strontian is a hamlet with a population of 200 recorded in 1991. This represented a decline from earlier recorded populations of 803 in 1871 and 691 in 1881.
The population has since rebounded to a 2013 estimate of ca. 350.

=== 19th century ===
According to John MacCulloch in his descriptive letters to Sir Walter Scott during the 1820s, Strontian is described as &quot;a wild and uninteresting country, though there is some grandeur in one scene, in a deep valley which is terminated by the fine form of Scuir Donald ... Strontian possesses now an excellent inn.&quot;

An 1830 source describes it: &quot;The village of Strontian is very pleasantly situated, directly at the head of Loch Sunart, the hills adjoining to which are crowned with beautiful and very thriving plantations. The Loch itself is here extremely picturesque ... [i]n a neighbourhood civilized and populous it would speedily become a favourite retreat.&quot;

In the 1830s, residents from Strontian and the surrounding area were among the first to use the &quot;Bounty Scheme&quot; to emigrate to Australia. The &quot;Brilliant&quot;, a Canadian-built ship, sailed from Tobermory to New South Wales in 1837 with 322 passengers, 105 of whom were from Ardnamurchan and Strontian.
The Bounty Scheme, which ran from 1835 to 1841, was proposed by Edward Gibbon Wakefield as a way for Australian settlers to subsidise the emigration of skilled tradespeople from Britain.

In the 1850s more emigrants left from the Strontian and Anaheilt area. The &quot;Allison&quot; sailed from Liverpool in 1851 for Melbourne with a number of Highlanders from the area aboard.

=== Strontian today ===
&#x27;Strontian House&#x27; was built for Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope in the late 1720s and was named after Colonel Horsy, Governor of the York Buildings Company. Latterly known as the Loch Sunart Hotel, it was still referred to as &#x27;Horsy Hall&#x27; and sometimes misspelt &#x27;Horsley Hall&#x27;.
The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1999.
A hotel was later opened in an existing building in the village.

In 1968, Strontian was listed among 2000 &quot;moribund&quot; Highland villages and selected to receive government funding for regeneration. This resulted in the shopping centre, cafe, and information kiosk which are located in the centre of the village.

In 2002 a high school was built in Strontian to serve secondary students of the Ardnamurchan peninsula. Previously local students had to travel to Fort William, Mallaig, or Tobermory for high school, often staying in hostel accommodation and making journeys of up to 4 hours round-trip.

== Other villages ==
Anaheilt (, meaning Ford of the Hind) is a village north of Strontian. The population in 1723 comprised eight families with 8 men, 10 women and 20 children, total 38. In 1806 its area extended to : ploughable land, cultivated with the spade, meadow and moor and pasture. Much of the cultivated and plougable land was turned to 28 crofts by 1828.

Bellsgrove, and Upper and Lower Scotstown are other historic villages, now considered part of Strontian.

<doc id="508960" wikidata="Q1068446" url="?curid=508960" title="Vladivostok Air">
<text>[[Joint stock company|JSC]] Vladivostok Air (also Vladivostok Avia; ) was an independent airline with its head office at the airport in Artyom, Primorski Krai, Russia. In 2011, it was reacquired by Aeroflot.

==Description==
As the largest carrier in the Russian Far East and Siberia, Vladivostok Air operated scheduled domestic flights within Russia and international flights to Africa, Asia, and Europe, as well as charter flights and a well established helicopter service. The main hub of operations was Vladivostok International Airport, with secondary hubs at Moscow Sheremetyevo International Airport and Khabarovsk Novy International Airport and a focus city in Ekaterinburg Koltsovo Airport.

Prior to late September 2008, only a few flights between the cities of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk were available on Vladivostok Air, but when the Russian government decided to close Dalavia, due to high debt levels, Vladivostok Air soon announced the start of 7 additional domestic routes and 4 new international routes from Khabarovsk.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The 1930s saw active construction of airports in the Soviet republics throughout the USSR. The Primorye region gained its first airport in 1931. Construction also began on two airfields; a hydro-airport (seaplane port) in Vladivostok&#x27;s Second River region and another named Ozernye Klyuchi (Lake Springs/Озерные Ключи), (which is now part of the current Vladivostok International Airport) near Artyom.

On 27 August 1932, a hydroplane (seaplane) destined to become the predecessor of Vladivostok Air completed its first flight and on 2 September, the hydroplane delivered four passengers from Khabarovsk to the Second River Airport marking. This is considered to be the official beginning of operations for Vladivostok Air, with regular flights from Khabarovsk to Vladivostok ever since.

In 1934, the Second River airport was moved to a dry location, allowing for the use of Polikarpov Po-2 aircraft, with which regular flights were made, and new airports also opened at Iman (now called Dalnerechensk) and Ozernye Klyuchi (Lake Springs) which, combined with newer aircraft, greatly fueled growth of the nascent airline.

===World War II and the turboprop era===
During World War II, Vladivostok Air&#x27;s Po-2s carried supplies of lead-tin concentrates for industrial purposes and ammunition to the front lines. In July 1941, Vladivostok Air&#x27;s fleet of Polikarpov U-2, Polikarpov P-5, and Shavrov Sh-2 aircraft were transferred to the Ozernye Klyuchi airport, opening a new era of development in the history of Primorye civil aviation and Vladivostok Air. Chemical, nautical, geological, and forest management applications followed after the end of the Great Patriotic War, operating from the rapidly developing airfields around the Primorye region. Many of which later served as the basis for modern airports constructed from the 1960s onwards.

Passenger flights from Vladivostok to Moscow began using Ilyushin Il-12 airliners in 1948. Five years later, in 1953, the Antonov An-2 commenced service, becoming a significant educational tool for Vladivostok Air, allowing pilots to amass experience in a number of different flight-related activities, while carrying several thousand passengers. Taking over the workload of the Po-2, the An-2 &quot;Annushka&quot; became a nearly irreplaceable aircraft for Vladivostok Air&#x27;s agricultural charters. Vladivostok Air also began basic use of the Lisunov Li-2 aircraft, which would continue to operate regular passenger flights from Ozernye Klyuchi Airport to Khabarovsk for the next 15 years.

Vladivostok Air&#x27;s robust helicopter operations began with the Mil Mi-1, Kamov Ka-15 and Mil Mi-4. These three helicopter types dutifully toiled away for some 30 odd-years and were later succeeded by the Mil Mi-8, Kamov Ka-26, and Kamov Ka-32.

===Jet era and expansion===

By 1958, the beginnings of the Primorye region&#x27;s passenger-jet era started with the introduction of the Tupolev Tu-104 airliner, and the Tupolev Tu-114D which completed the first trial, scheduled, non-stop flight from Moscow to Vladivostok (on Aeroflot) in May 1958. When the size of the Ozernye Klyuchi airport restricted Vladivostok Air&#x27;s expansion, the ground facilities were improved to allow regular flights with Tu-104s (1958), Ilyushin Il-18s (1963), and Antonov An-10s (1964). These improvements to the airport sharply increased passenger volumes. The first brick built terminal opened in February 1961, facilitating the processing of up to 200 passengers at once, marking the beginning of the larger airport known as Vladivostok International Airport.

Between the 1960s and 1980s, pilots from Vladivostok Air became pioneers in servicing the region&#x27;s various whaling and fishing towns. While with Mi-1 helicopters, on 30 August 1961, Vladivostok Air entered the fishing industry as well. Helicopters from Vladivostok Air have also served as flying-cranes and ambulances, further expanding their growing helicopter charter operations.
In 1973, construction started on a new terminal at Vladivostok International Airport which began operating at the end of 1976. With the increase in terminal capacity, Vladivostok Air soon began regular service with Tupolev Tu-154s, heralding a period of dynamic development of Vladivostok Air&#x27;s fleet as new Yakovlev Yak-40s and Mil Mi-8s were purchased. The completion of a second runway in June 1985 opened up Vladivostok Airport to all modern aircraft and provided for the non-stop Aeroflot air service between Moscow and Vladivostok onboard Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft.

===Post-Soviet era===
In 1990, after having signed an agreement in Papua New Guinea for the use of Ka-32 helicopters, Vladivostok Air entered the international arena. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992, Vladivostok opened to international flights, fueling rapid expansion at Vladivostok Air. During this time period, two Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft in addition to several Tupolev Tu-154B-2 aircraft were purchased for use on international routes.

Beginning in 1994, Vladivostok Air was an openly traded stock company, &quot;Vladivostok Air&quot;, whose holdings at the time included the airline and Vladivostok International Airport. By 1995, the first long-distance Tupolev Tu-154M aircraft were purchased.

On 4 March 1999, the renovated international terminal at Vladivostok International Airport was put into operation, allowing for additional flights to Asia and North America.

===2000 – 2014===

In 2004, Vladivostok Air passed the IATA Operational Safety Audit, becoming a full International Air Transport Association member leading to recognition of Vladivostok Air as a safe and reliable airline.

In 2005, Vladivostok Air was the first airline in the world to operate the new Tupolev Tu-204-300 aircraft, a fleet of six was purchased.

The large-scale reconstruction of Vladivostok International Airport&#x27;s domestic terminal was completed in December 2006, increasing passenger comfort, capacity, and growth.

With the help of the ILFC, Vladivostok Air leased an Airbus A-320 on 5 February 2007. It was the first foreign-made aircraft in the Russian Far East; Vladivostok Air flew up to 7 of them.

JSC Vladivostok International Airport was separated from Vladivostok Air on 15 February 2008; Vladivostok International Airport was then included in the Russian register of open joint stock companies. One of the most significant achievements of 2008 was the successful accreditation for compliance with IATA safety requirements (IOSA).

When Vladivostok Air celebrated its 15th anniversary as an open joint stock company on 20 January 2009, it had transformed from a regional carrier into the largest company in the Russian Far East and East Siberia. Passenger numbers increased to over 900,000 annually because of fleet expansion and modernisation. June 2009 saw the introduction of the first long-haul Airbus A330-300 service, connecting Vladivostok and Moscow, with more A320s and A330s expected to join the fleet between October 2009 and the summer of 2010. Orders for four Antonov An-148 with two options were placed at the 2009 MAKS Airshow.

On 28 April 2009, Vladivostok Air received the Wings of Russia 2008 award in the category of &quot;Airline of the Year — Passengers Choice&quot;. Vladivostok Air also announced its earnings on 15 July, showing that, despite the recession, passenger traffic had increased by an incredible 36.6%, while passenger capacity was 28.8% higher in the first six months of 2009 than in the first six months of 2008, with the load factor increasing by 9.5%. Vladivostok Air&#x27;s income was an astounding 38.1% higher for the same period of time in 2009 than in 2008, attributed to fleet network optimization, transition to more fuel efficient aircraft, and to the takeover of Dalavia&#x27;s Khabarovsk hub.

On 17 July 2009, Vladivostok Air introduced its new online sales system, with the new reservation system allowing purchases with all major credit cards. In addition to the new sales system, passengers were offered three economy fares and one business class fare including &quot;Promo&quot;, &quot;Eco&quot;, &quot;Eco +&quot; and &quot;Business&quot;. &quot;Promo&quot; was the cheapest fare selection, with the bare minimum amenities, while the &quot;Business&quot; fare was the most expensive, with access to all business class amenities.

Vladivostok Air received an additional A320 aircraft on 12 August 2010, bringing the total amount in its fleet to seven. On 18 August, an interline agreement was signed with United Airlines. On 19–20 August, Vladivostok Air successfully passed its second IOSA audit, further maintaining its IATA membership.

Aeroflot acquired a majority stake in Vladivostok Air in November 2011, intending to convert Vladivostok Air into a Far Eastern regional airline and to eliminate its long-haul flights.

Vladivostok Air ended operations on 14 December 2013; along with SAT Airlines, it became the new airline Aurora. The airline&#x27;s AOC was revoked by Rosaviatsia in .

===Aeroflot===
Before the 2011 acquisition, Vladivostok Airlines was a non-alliance affiliate of Aeroflot, amplifying Aeroflot&#x27;s network from Moscow-Sheremetyevo and Vladivostok.

===Codeshare agreements===
Vladivostok Airlines had one codeshare and multiple interline agreements with the following airlines in August 2010. Airlines marked with a * indicate interline agreements:
==Fleet==

The Vladivostok Air fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

The airline took delivery of its first A320 in November 2006 under a lease agreement with the ILFC. Since the arrival of the first A320, six more have arrived, with the latest delivered in August 2010.

On 6 January 2009, ILFC announced the airline&#x27;s lease of three used Airbus A330-300 aircraft. The first aircraft was delivered in May 2009, after coming off lease from Aer Lingus. The lease term was for 7 years. The aircraft entered service on 9 June 2009, flying between Vladivostok and Moscow. The A330 seated 327 people and was mainly used to fly between Vladivostok/Khabarovsk and Moscow. The second A330 was delivered in October 2009, while the third arrived in March 2010.

With an influx of more modern aircraft, like the A320 and Tu-204, Vladivostok Air shifted all remaining Tu-154 aircraft into its reserve and charter fleet.

During MAKS Airshow 2009, Vladivostok Air signed a precontractual agreement to buy four Antonov An-148, with options for two more. These regional jets&#x27; capacity was 68–85 passengers and they replaced the four aging Yak-40 aircraft. The aircraft were expected to be delivered between 2012 and 2014.

The average age of Vladivostok Air&#x27;s A320s was 13.4 years, while the A330s&#x27; was 15.4 years as of May 2010.

===Formerly operated===
* Tupolev-154M
* Tupolev Tu-204-300

==Incidents and accidents==

In July 2001, Vladivostok Air Flight 352, a Tupolev Tu-154 belonging to Vladivostok Air crashed while attempting to land in Irkutsk, Russia, killing all 145 people aboard. A Russian official said that 12 Chinese died on the flight.

<doc id="508964" wikidata="Q877342" url="?curid=508964" title="Rakugo">
<text>is a form of Japanese verbal comedy, traditionally performed in &quot;yose&quot; theatres. The lone sits on a raised platform, a . Using only a and a as props, and without standing up from the seiza sitting position, the rakugo artist depicts a long and complicated comical (or sometimes sentimental) story. The story always involves the dialogue of two or more characters. The difference between the characters is depicted only through change in pitch, tone, and a slight turn of the head.

==Description==
The speaker is in the middle of the stage, and his purpose is to stimulate the general hilarity with tone and limited, yet specific body gestures. The monologue always ends with a narrative stunt (punch line) known as or , consisting of a sudden interruption of the wordplay flow. Twelve kinds of ochi are codified and recognized, with more complex variations having evolved through time from the more basic forms.

Early rakugo has developed into various styles, including the , the , the , and . In many of these forms the &quot;ochi&quot;, which is essential to the original rakugo, is absent.

Rakugo has been described as &quot;a sitcom with one person playing all the parts&quot; by Noriko Watanabe, assistant professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Comparative Literature at Baruch College.

==Lexical background==
The precursor of rakugo was called . The oldest appearance of the kanji which refers specifically to this type of performance dates back to 1787, but at the time the characters themselves (落とし噺) were normally read as &quot;otoshibanashi&quot; (&quot;dropping story&quot;).

In the middle of the Meiji period (1868–1912) the expression &quot;rakugo&quot; first started being used, and it came into common usage only in the Shōwa period (1926–1989).

==History==

One of the predecessors of rakugo is considered to be a humorous story in &quot;setsuwa&quot;. The &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; and the &quot;Uji Shūi Monogatari&quot; were &quot;setsuwa&quot; collections compiled from the Heian period (794–1185) to the Kamakura period (1185–1333); they contained many funny stories, and Japanese Buddhist monks preached Buddhism by quoting them. In &quot;Makura no Sōshi&quot;, it is described that the monks had gained a reputation for their beautiful voices and narrative arts.

The direct ancestor of rakugo is a humorous story among the stories narrated by &quot;otogishū&quot; in the Sengoku Period (1467–1615) . &quot;Otogishū&quot; were scholars, Buddhist monks and tea masters who served daimyo (feudal lord), and their duty was to give lectures on books to daimyo and to be a partner for chatting. Anrakuan Sakuden, who was an &quot;otogishū&quot; and a monk of the Jōdo-shū, is often said to be the originator of &quot;rakugo&quot;, and his 8 volumes of &quot;Seisui Sho&quot; contain 1000 stories, including the original stories of &quot;rakugo&quot;.

Around 1670 in the Edo period (1603–1867), three storytellers appeared who were regarded as the first &quot;rakugoka&quot;. Tsuyuno Gorobe in Kyoto, Yonezawa Hikohachi in Osaka, and Shikano Buzaemon in Edo built simple huts around the same age and began telling funny stories to the general public for a price. Rakugo in this period was called &quot;Tsujibanashi&quot;, but once it lost popularity, rakugo declined for about 100 years.

In 1786, Utei Enba presided over a &quot;rakugo&quot; show at a &quot;ryōtei&quot;, a traditional Japanese catering venue, in Mukōjima. He is regarded as the father of the restoration of &quot;rakugo&quot;. His performances led to the establishment of the first theater dedicated to rakugo (&quot;yose&quot;) by Sanshōtei Karaku and Sanyūtei Enshō, and the revival of &quot;rakugo&quot;.

During the Edo period, thanks to the emergence of the merchant class of the &quot;chōnin&quot;, &quot;rakugo&quot; spread to the lower classes. Many groups of performers were formed, and collections of texts were finally printed. During the 17th century the actors were known as &quot;hanashika&quot; (found written as , , or ; &quot;storyteller&quot;), corresponding to the modern term, .

Before the advent of modern &quot;rakugo&quot; there were the : short comical vignettes ending with an &quot;ochi&quot;, popular between the 17th and the 19th centuries. These were enacted in small public venues, or in the streets, and printed and sold as pamphlets. The origin of &quot;kobanashi&quot; is to be found in the &quot;Kinō wa kyō no monogatari&quot; (&quot;Yesterday Stories Told Today&quot;, c. 1620), the work of an unknown author collecting approximately 230 stories describing the common class.

==Types of &quot;ochi&quot;==

’’Niwaka ochi’’: An ochi using a pun, it is also called &#x27;Jiguchi Ochi.&#x27;

’’Hyoshi ochi’’: An ochi that uses repeated punchlines.

’’Sakasa ochi’’: An ochi with a twist punchline, one where roles are reversed

’’Kangae ochi’’: A punchline that is hard to understand but people will laugh after pondering for a while.

‘’Mawari ochi’’: A punchline that ends the story by returning to the beginning.

’’Mitate ochi’’: An ochi that uses unexpected punchlines.

’’Manuke ochi’’: An ochi that ends the story with a dumb or ridiculous joke

’’Totan ochi’’: An ochi using a signature phrase.

’’Buttsuke ochi’’: An ending with a punch line based on a misunderstanding.

’’Shigusa ochi’’: A punchline that uses a physical gesture.

==Important contributors==

Many artists contributed to the development of &quot;rakugo&quot;. Some were simply performers, but many also composed original works.

Among the more famous &quot;rakugoka&quot; of the Tokugawa period were performers like Anrakuan Sakuden (1554–1642), the author of the &quot;Seisuishō&quot; (&quot;Laughter to Chase Away Sleep&quot;, 1628), a collection of more than 1,000 stories. In Edo (today&#x27;s Tokyo) there also lived (1649–1699) who wrote the &quot;Shikano Buzaemon kudenbanashi&quot; (&quot;Oral Instruction Discourses of Shikano Buzaemon&quot;) and the &quot;Shika no makifude&quot; (&quot;The Deer&#x27;s Brush&quot;, 1686), a work containing 39 stories, eleven of which are about the kabuki milieu. (1743–1822) was author of the &quot;Rakugo rokugi&quot; (&quot;The Six Meanings of Rakugo&quot;).

Kyoto was the home of (1643–1703), who is considered the father of the rakugo tradition of the Kamigata area (). His works are included in the &quot;Karukuchi tsuyu ga hanashi&quot; (&quot;Jocular Tsuyu&#x27;s Stories&quot;, date of composition unknown), containing many word games, episodes from the lives of famous literary authors, and plays on the different dialects from the Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto areas.

Of a similar structure is the &quot;Karukuchi gozen otoko&quot; (&quot;One-liners: An Important Storyteller&quot;, date of publication unknown) in which are collected the stories of , who lived in Ōsaka towards the end of the 17th century. An example from Yonezawa Hikohachi&#x27;s collection:

For the poor man is already dead. The joke becomes clearer when one notes that a Japanese traditional bathing tub is shaped like a coffin.

===Current performers===
Current &quot;rakugo&quot; artists include Tachibanaya Enzō, Katsura Bunshi VI, Tachibanaya Takezō II, Tatekawa Shinosuke and Hayashiya Shōzō IX. Furthermore, many people regarded as more mainstream comedians originally trained as rakugoka apprentices, even adopting stage names given to them by their masters. Some examples include Akashiya Sanma, Shōfukutei Tsurube II, and Shōfukutei Shōhei. Another famous &quot;rakugo&quot; performer, Shijaku Katsura II, was known outside Japan for his performances of &quot;rakugo&quot; in English.

==Titles and Repertoire==
&quot;Rakugo&quot; stories are generally divided into two categories: classical repertoire stories (&quot;koten rakugo&quot;, 古典落語) and original stories (&quot;shinsaku rakugo&quot;, 新作落語). &quot;Koten rakugo&quot; consists of traditional tales that, in principle, can be adapted and performed by any storyteller. In contrast, &quot;shinsaku rakugo&quot; refers to new, original works created by individual performers. As the copyright holders, these performers must grant permission before their stories can be performed by others. While some classical repertoire stories are attributed to specific authors, these authors have often been deceased for a considerable time, allowing the stories to enter the shared repertoire.

Notable examples of classical repertoire stories include:
* – a kaidanbanashi, or ghost story
* – the life of a boy with a ridiculously long name
* – a group of boys try to scare off a boaster
* – a naive lord enjoys commoners&#x27; foods
* – a meta-gag in which a father is mocked by his son because of his bad storytelling of the Japanese folktale Momotarō
* – a tree begins growing out of a man&#x27;s head
* – a man tries to outwit the owner of a piece of antique porcelain
* – a good-for-nothing husband finds a huge sum of money
* – cash reward to whom that could identify a strange fish

<text>Transaero (), officially &quot;OJSC Transaero Airlines&quot; () was a Russian airline that operated scheduled and charter flights to over 150 domestic and international destinations. Transaero&#x27;s main hubs were Moscow Vnukovo Airport and Saint Petersburg Airport, with further bases throughout Russia. For much of its history the head office was at Domodedovo International Airport, and towards the end its head office was in Saint Petersburg.

Transaero filed for bankruptcy on 1 October 2015, and announced that it would cease all operations by 15 December the same year. However, Russian authorities revoked its operating license on 25 October.

In September 2021, the Moscow Commercial Court extended Transaero&#x27;s business failure until March 2022 following a motion by the airline&#x27;s bankruptcy supervisor Alexey Belokopyt.

==History==
===Early years===
 

Transaero began as a charter airline with aircraft leased from Aeroflot. It was incorporated as a joint-stock company on 28 December 1990 and was the first private company approved for scheduled passenger services in the Soviet Union. Its first charter service was Moscow to Tel Aviv on 5 November 1991. In July 1992, Transaero received its own Ilyushin Il-86. It became the first privately owned airline to operate scheduled flights in Russia when it launched its Moscow–Alykel Airport, Norilsk flight in January 1993 followed by Kyiv, Sochi and Almaty later the same year. Its first international scheduled route outside the former Soviet Union was from Moscow to Tel Aviv in November 1993.

In April 1993, Transaero started operating Western-made aircraft when it received its first Boeing 737-200, followed by its first Boeing 757-200 in April 1994.

Transaero was also the first Russian airline with a frequent flyer program, which it established in 1995. It was also the first Russian airline with a Federal Aviation Administration aircraft maintenance certificate, which it obtained in 1997. In December 1998 a weekly service between Moscow and London Gatwick commenced. Transaero operated its first Boeing 737-700 in 1998, followed by Boeing 767-200 and Boeing 737-300 in 2002 and Boeing 767-300 and Boeing 737-400 in 2003. An agreement was signed to purchase 10 Tupolev Tu-214-300 in the same year. In 2005, Transaero became the first Russian passenger airline to operate the Boeing 747 when it started services on 11 July 2005 with a leased, ex-Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-200 on scheduled services from Moscow to Tel Aviv. The aircraft would also operate summer charter flights to holiday destinations.

In May 2005, Transaero added a flight between Moscow and Montreal, marking the first time the airline flew to Canada. On 21 June 2006, Transaero also began operating nonstop flights between Moscow and Toronto. The service to Toronto was temporarily suspended in September 2008, but was later restored, whereas the service to Montreal was cancelled in 2009.

It was reported in 2007 that Transaero negotiated a deal with Continental Airlines to purchase 10 of the Boeing 737-500 aircraft still in Continental&#x27;s fleet. In November 2007 the airline announced a new scheduled bi-weekly service between Moscow and Sydney, Australia via Hong Kong, using Boeing 767-300 aircraft; commencing 24 December 2007, although the route was later terminated. Transaero also started to replace all of its Boeing 747-200s with used Boeing 747-400s at the end of 2007.

===Late 2000s and early 2010s===
Austrian Airlines and Transaero Airlines began code-sharing on Vienna-Moscow flights in October 2009.

In April 2010, Transaero arranged to lease 9 ex-Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400s which entered the fleet in 2010–2012. In December 2010, Transaero announced that they would increase their deal to 12 Boeing 747-400s. In October 2010, Transaero launched flights to Beijing, Miami and New York City. This marked the return of Transaero to the United States since cancelling service to Los Angeles. Beijing became the second Chinese destination after Sanya.

In 2011, Transaero received four Boeing 777-300 aircraft previously owned by Singapore Airlines. Also in 2011, Transaero agreed to buy four of Boeing&#x27;s newest widebody, the Boeing 747-8, and put in a memorandum of understanding for 4 Airbus A380s. Transaero also ordered 4 Boeing 787s on 26 December 2011, confirming this order on 8 April 2012.

On 29 April 2012 Transaero resumed flights between Moscow and Los Angeles, utilizing a 777-200ER. In 2013 Transaero carried nearly 12.5 million people and operated 98 aircraft. In 2014, Transaero began direct flights from Moscow to Miami with Boeing 747-400s.

Transaero hosted a competition for a new logo and livery for rebranding in 2013–2014, but did not discuss the procedure&#x27;s timetable. In April 2015, the airline decided to rebrand during 2015 and to introduce the new livery and logo with upcoming Airbus A380, Boeing 747-8, and Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft.

===Final years and demise===
By March 2015, Transaero had accumulated around 1.1 billion euros (approximately 77 billion rubles) of debt.

In May 2015 Transaero announced the expected receipt of its first two Airbus A380-800s and one Boeing 747-8 later in the year. The A380s were intended to operate from Moscow to New York and Vladivostok. However, this was quickly followed by a report that Transaero asked Airbus to reschedule the delivery of the first A380 beyond 2015 due to financial difficulties. At the IATA Annual General Meeting and World Air Transport Summit in June 2015, the president of Airbus, Fabrice Brégier said &quot;I’m sure we will meet the target to deliver the A380s to Transaero. The problem is that they are facing a difficult economic situation because of the rouble’s devaluation and a shrinking market for tourism from Russia.&quot;

Transaero announced the transfer of all operations at Moscow-Domodedovo to their other main hub at Moscow-Vnukovo to unify Moscow operations by 25 October 2015. This would not happen because of Transaero&#x27;s closure.

In September 2015, Aeroflot agreed to acquire 75% of the highly indebted Transaero Airlines for the symbolic price of one rouble. However, by 2 October 2015, Aeroflot dropped the offer, stating that no agreement with Transaero and its shareholders had been reached by the deadline. The same day, with the debt having swollen to 3.9 billion euros (260 billion rubles) Transaero announced it intended to end all operations on 15 December 2015 as it faced imminent bankruptcy. Soon afterwards, Aeroflot announced the takeover of 34 of Transaero&#x27;s leased aircraft, of which 20 are long-haul models. Subsequent to this announcement, Transaero ceased all ticket sales and refunded travel booked for after the shutdown date, and began to drastically reduce its schedule, cancelling or suspending flights on a daily basis and operating only a provisional schedule.

On 20 October 2015, competitor S7 Airlines announced an interest to buy a 50 percent stake in the bankrupt airline. After this sale fell through, on 24 October 2015 Russian authorities announced that Transaero&#x27;s air operating certificate would be revoked within 48 hours (as the summer schedule concluded) and began to allocate Transaero&#x27;s former traffic rights to other airlines, stating that Transaero&#x27;s enormous debt meant that its continued operation would pose an imminent hazard to the flying public.

Prior to the shutdown, Transaero began to ferry its remaining fleet to Teruel in Spain. Among those are six of its nine long-range Boeing 747s and almost half its fleet of medium-range Boeing 737s. The final Transaero flight, Flight 160, flown by a Boeing 767-200ER, operated from Sokol Airport near Magadan in eastern Russia to Moscow-Vnukovo, landing on 25 October 2015 at 11:54 UTC.

In 2017 the United States Air Force entered into a contract with Boeing to purchase two undelivered Boeing 747-8s ordered by Transaero. The pair of planes have registration numbers N894BA and N895BA. The Air Force and Secret Service will retrofit these new aircraft with telecommunications and security equipment to bring them to the required security level of the presidential aircraft.

== Safety ==

In its 25-year history, Transaero never had an accident resulting in loss of life or a hull loss. In 2014, JACDEC ranked Transaero as the 17th safest airline in the world and the safest airline in Russia.

==Corporate affairs==
Its head office was in Saint Petersburg.

As of 2009 its head office was on the property of Domodedovo International Airport in Domodedovo, Moscow Oblast.

===Management===
Transaero was owned primarily by Aleksandr Pleshakov and his wife Olga Pleshakova, who was the CEO of the airline for most of its existence. Aleksandr&#x27;s mother Tatiana Anodina has been the head of the Interstate Aviation Committee, the aviation oversight body in CIS, since 1991. Aleksandr&#x27;s father is Piotr Pleshakov - a Soviet military engineer, who was the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Minister of Radioelectronic Industry&quot; from 1974 until 1987. There was press speculation regarding Anodina&#x27;s conflict of interest in certifying aircraft with respect to Transaero&#x27;s market position.

===Maintenance operations===
Transaero established a maintenance company, Transaero Engineering Ireland, based at Shannon Airport, Ireland as a result of its purchase of the Air Atlanta aircraft maintenance operation. In addition to maintaining its own aircraft, Transaero Engineering also performed third-party maintenance work for other customers, including airlines Air Berlin, Arkia Israel Airlines, El Al, and the TUI Group family of airlines, and aircraft lessors AerCap, Aircastle, BBAM LLC, FLY Leasing, GECAS, ILFC, Macquarie AirFinance, and SMBC. 
On 5 January 2015, the company entered examinership after the airline failed to pay its maintenance bill (approx €2.4m) for the year 2014.

The company, Transaero Engineering Ireland, was renamed Atlantic Aviation Group after Patrick Jordan, the former COO of Siteserv acquired the business out of examinership in a transaction reportedly valued at €2.5 million.

==Destinations==
===Codeshare agreements===
Prior to the closure of the airline, Transaero maintained codeshare agreements with the following airlines:

==Fleet==

=== Fleet before shutdown ===


Just prior to Transaero&#x27;s shutdown in 2015, its fleet consisted of the following aircraft and planned orders:

===Historical fleet===

==Cabin==
Transaero&#x27;s cabins differed greatly in amenities and layout from plane to plane, depending on which airline the aircraft was bought or leased from, ranging from poorly equipped cabins of older European/USA operators on 737s to better features in aircraft leased or purchased from Singapore Airlines (Transaero had to install their own first class cabin, because SIA kept their first class seats). The description below applied only to the Boeing 777s which used to belong to Singapore Airlines. 777-300s and some 747-400 were retrofitted with the Fiber optics to the screen Lumexis AVOD system in all classes. Wi-Fi Internet connection and cellular services are available on select routes and planes, with the price tag varying from 400 RUR ($12 US) for an hour to 800 RUR ($24 US) for 24 hours.

;Tourist Economy Class
Transaero&#x27;s &quot;Tourist Economy Class&quot; featured standard seat pitch (depends on aircraft but usually 31-32 inches), recline and width. The airline provides free food for Tourist passengers and an in-flight entertainment system is available for free on Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 777-300. The in-flight entertainment on international routes aboard the 747, and the 777-200ER, was either an integrated personal TV with 5-7 broadcast channels or AVOD Lumexis.

;Premium Economy Class
Transaero&#x27;s &quot;Premium Economy Class&quot; offered the same seat width as the Tourist Economy Class but a greater seat pitch of up to 36 inches and enhanced recline features for a recline of 29 degrees(just over 7 inches). The Premium Economy Class seats on the 777-300 were also distinguished by red seats instead of the blue seats in Tourist Economy Class. In addition to more seat pitch, recline and free food, Transaero also offers a larger baggage allowance for the Premium Economy class fares. The in-flight-entertainment system was available for free, with Lumexis AVOD on select Boeing 747-400s and all Boeing 777-300s. Passengers flying Premium Economy were also able to make use of a dedicated check-in desk at selected airports.

;Business/Premium Class
The &quot;Business Class&quot; offered passengers a wider seat than Economy along with additional legroom and deeper recline. Each seat had two armrests. In-Flight-Entertainment was free of charge and included a larger selection of music, movies and television. The cabins were located either in the upper deck on 747s or in the front part of the plane on all other types. The menus offered more choices and better quality food than Economy. The inflight service was individual and a la carte with wide selection of free beverages, wells and wines. There were free taxi transfers from Moscow Airports on some international routes and some fare classes.

;Imperial Class
The &quot;Imperial Class&quot; was Transaero&#x27;s First Class. The seats offered extra privacy and were the widest seats of all on the aircraft. The seat reclined fully flat to form a large bed for passengers and the food was either Russian or European. Complimentary taxi transfers were available for Imperial Class passengers.

<text>John Rusnak is a former currency trader at Allfirst bank, then part of AIB Group, in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. He is known for committing one of the largest ever cases of bank fraud, where he lost his company US$691 million after a series of bad bets.

==Allfirst scandal==
On January 17, 2003 Rusnak was sentenced to years in prison for hiding US$691 million in losses at the bank in 2002, after bad bets snowballed in one of the largest ever cases of bank fraud. He was transferred from prison to a halfway house in June 2008, to home confinement in September 2008, and ultimately released from home confinement on January 5, 2009, serving less than 6 years. Since his return to society, Rusnak has become an advocate for second chances for men coming home from incarceration and for those in drug and alcohol rehabilitation. Rusnak currently serves as the Executive Director of unCUFFED ministries working with juveniles who are incarcerated in adult detention facilities.

Rusnak could have faced up to 30 years in prison. The original year sentence was part of a plea bargain with US prosecutors. He was released early having earned good-behavior credits and completing a drug treatment program. Upon his release, he started paying US$1,000 a month for the five years of his probation.

Rusnak will remain on the hook for the full $691 million he lost, but prosecutors said the amount he pays back will depend on how much money he is able to make after leaving prison.

Following the scandal, AIB sold Allfirst to M&amp;T Bank of Buffalo, New York, in July 2003. AIB retained 23% of M&amp;T stock. Although the news media blamed the scandal, the merger talks actually began prior to the revelation of the losses. In the banking environment at that time the merger was inevitable. Over 1,100 Allfirst employees lost their jobs in the sale.

It is published by Gill and Macmillan.

<doc id="508972" wikidata="Q5669219" url="?curid=508972" title="Harry Graham (poet)">
<text>Jocelyn Henry Clive &#x27;Harry&#x27; Graham (23 December 1874 – 30 October 1936) was an English writer. He was a successful journalist and later, after distinguished military service, a leading lyricist for operettas and musical comedies, but he is now best remembered as a writer of humorous verse in a style of grotesquerie and black humour.

==Life==

===Family and education===
Graham was the second son of Sir Henry Graham, KCB (1842–1930), Clerk of the Parliaments, and his first wife, Lady Edith Elizabeth Gathorne-Hardy, who died two weeks after Harry&#x27;s birth. Graham&#x27;s elder brother Ronald Graham entered the diplomatic service, becoming Ambassador to Italy (1921–33). Graham was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

===Military career===

Graham was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards as a second lieutenant on 6 March 1895, and was promoted to lieutenant on 9 January 1898. From March 1899 to 1901 and again in 1902–1904 he served as aide-de-camp to Lord Minto, Governor-General of Canada. In the intervening year, he served in the Second Boer War in South Africa. He was promoted to captain (supernumerary) on 20 April 1901, and received a regular commission from his regiment in August 1902, as he returned to Canada. Graham kept a journal of his trip across Canada with Minto to the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon in 1900, called &quot;Across Canada to the Klondyke&quot;, which he later presented to Minto, and which was eventually published. Graham retired from the army in 1904, and became private secretary to the former Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, 1904–06.

On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Graham rejoined the Coldstream Guards and served in France in the 40th and 5th divisions.

===Marriage and later life===
Graham was engaged to Ethel Barrymore, but they did not marry. He married Dorothy Villiers in 1910, and they had a daughter, Virginia Graham, who followed him as a writer, contributing many articles to &quot;Punch&quot;.

Graham died of cancer in London in 1936, aged 61. A memorial service for him was held in St Martin-in-the-Fields.

==Career as a writer==

===Light verse===
His first published works appeared during his military career. In 1906, he became a full-time writer, as a journalist and author of light verse, popular fiction and history, including &quot;A Group of Scottish Women&quot; (1908). 

Graham is best remembered for his series of cheerfully cruel &quot;Ruthless Rhymes&quot;, first published in 1898 under the pseudonym Col. D. Streamer, a reference to his regiment. These were described by &quot;The Times&quot;, in an editorial that compared him to Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll and W. S. Gilbert, as &quot;that enchanted world where there are no values nor standards of conduct or feeling, and where the plainest sense is the plainest nonsense&quot;. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; also compares his verse with that of W. S. Gilbert and suggests that his prose was an early influence on P. G. Wodehouse. Graham&#x27;s other light verse exhibited a delight in language, and not only his native one, as in his response to the news that Wilhelm II, visiting Brussels, spoke at length with Baron de Haulleville, Director of the Congo Museum, in French, German and English: the poem began:

Guten Morgen, mon ami!&lt;br&gt;Heute ist es schönes Wetter!&lt;br&gt;Charmé de vous voir ici!&lt;br&gt;Never saw you looking better!
An example of a &quot;Ruthless Rhyme&quot; is:

Father heard his children scream&lt;br&gt;So he threw them in the stream&lt;br&gt;Saying, as he drowned the third,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Children should be seen, not heard!&quot;

Graham&#x27;s pleasure in word-play is illustrated in his poem on &quot;Poetical Economy&quot;:

When I’ve a syllable de trop,&lt;br&gt; 
I cut it off, without apol.:&lt;br&gt;
This verbal sacrifice, I know,&lt;br&gt; 
May irritate the schol.;&lt;br&gt;
But all must praise my dev’lish cunn.&lt;br&gt;
Who realise that Time is Mon.

Some of the &quot;Ruthless Rhymes&quot; involved &quot;Little Willie&quot;, a poetic personification of youthful mischief, whose gruesome acts of violence with indifferent or cheerfully inappropriate responses inspired readers to compose similar verses. The most common format of these poems was a four lines in trochaic tetrameter. Victor Hely-Hutchinson composed a series of song settings for the poems published as &quot;Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes&quot; in 1945 and 1946.

&quot;When Grandmama Fell Off the Boat: The Best of Harry Graham&quot; is an anthology of Graham&#x27;s verse (1986, Salem House). A 2nd edition was published by Sheldrake Press in 2009.

===Lyricist and translator===
During the war, Graham started to write lyrics for English operettas and musical comedies, including &quot;Tina&quot; (1915), &quot;Sybil&quot; (1916), the 1917 hit operetta &quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot; and &quot;A Southern Maid&quot; (1920), and English adaptations of European operettas such as &quot;Whirled into Happiness&quot; (1922), &quot;Madame Pompadour&quot; (1923), &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot; (1931) and many others.

His best known lyrics were &quot;You are my heart&#x27;s delight&quot;, his English version of &quot;Dein ist mein ganzes Herz&quot;, from &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot;, composed by Franz Lehár (and made famous by the popular tenor Richard Tauber), and &quot;Goodbye&quot;, from his English adaptation of &quot;The White Horse Inn&quot; (originally &quot;Adieu, mein kleiner Gardeoffizier&quot; from Robert Stolz&#x27;s operetta &quot;Die lustigen Weiber von Wien&quot;, a song which later achieved great popularity as sung by Josef Locke).

<text>JSC Dalavia (), also known as Dalavia — Far Eastern Airways () was an airline based in Khabarovsk, Russia. It operated scheduled and charter flights within Russia, and international flights to Asia. Its main base was Khabarovsk Novy Airport. The Russian Government suspended its traffic rights in October 2008.

==History==
Khabarovsk&#x27;s airport received its first concrete runway in August 1953, and in the same year Khabarovsk Aviation Enterprise () was established as part of Aeroflot. Flights were initially operated by aircraft including the Polikarpov Po-2, Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-14, and later the Tupolev Tu-154 and Ilyushin Il-62 were operated.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the resultant breakup of Aeroflot, Khabarovsk Aviation Enterprise continued to operate under Aeroflot codes and in Aeroflot livery, in return for a licensing fee. On 29 March 1999, the airline began operations to Seoul in South Korea from Khabarovsk under its own codes, and with the new name of Dalavia. In December 1999 the airline started operating the route Khabarovsk-Bangkok-Singapore on a once-weekly basis.

The first Tu-214 was handed over to the airline at the KAPO plant in Kazan on 22 May 2001, in a ceremony presided over by Mintimer Shaimiyev, the President of Tatarstan.
Dalavia carried 621,405 passenger in 2004, an increase of 9.1% over the previous year. Of this, some 135,792 passengers were carried on the airline&#x27;s international route network. This year the airline was given recognition as the best domestic airline in Russia in the &quot;Wings of Russia&quot; competition.

In December 2006, Dalavia signed a US$170 million deal with Sukhoi Civil Aircraft for the supply of six Sukhoi Superjet 100s, with options on an additional four airframes. From June 2007, the airline was to offer a weekly flight with Tupolev Tu-214 equipment from Anchorage, Alaska, to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky with a flight continuation to Khabarovsk.

On 26 January 2009, Rosaviatsiya cancelled the air operator&#x27;s certificate of Dalavia. On 9 June 2009, the Arbitration Court of Khabarovsk Krai declared Dalavia bankrupt with debts almost twice the amount of its assets. Its accounts payables totalled some 1.7 billion rubles and wages for employees exceeded 350 million roubles. According to presidential decree, after the bankruptcy Dalavia was transferred to Russian Technologies when it was planned for Dalavia to enter the structure of Rosavia.

<text>Mexican literature stands as one of the most prolific and influential within Spanish-language literary traditions, alongside those of Spain and Argentina. This rich and diverse tradition spans centuries, encompassing a wide array of genres, themes, and voices that reflect the complexities of Mexican society and culture. From ancient indigenous myths to contemporary urban narratives, Mexican literature serves as a poignant reflection of the nation&#x27;s essence, inviting readers to explore its rich history, diverse culture, and collective aspirations.

Propelled by visionary writers, Mexican literature has made an indelible mark on global literary discourse. From the Baroque elegance of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz&#x27;s poetry to the modernist prose of Carlos Fuentes, Mexican authors adeptly explore themes of identity, history, social justice, and the human experience. Notable literary works such as Juan Rulfo&#x27;s haunting &quot;Pedro Páramo,&quot; Octavio Paz&#x27;s introspective &quot;The Labyrinth of Solitude,&quot; and Laura Esquivel&#x27;s enchanting &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; showcase the depth and diversity of Mexican literary expression, garnering international acclaim for their profound insights into Mexican culture and society.

The Mexican Revolution of the early 20th century inspired a new generation of writers like José Vasconcelos and Mariano Azuela, capturing the spirit of the times in their works. During the mid-20th century Latin American literary boom, Mexican authors such as Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, and Juan Rulfo gained global recognition for their contributions to world literature. The Death of Artemio Cruz (Spanish: &quot;La muerte de Artemio Cruz&quot;) by Carlos Fuentes acclaimed novel, first published in 1962, explores themes of power, corruption, and identity in post-revolutionary Mexico. It has been translated into multiple languages and has garnered widespread critical acclaim. Other notable writers include: Rosario Castellanos, Sergio Pitol, Alfonso Reyes, José Emilio Pacheco, and Elena Garro.

A movement of great relevance to the literary history of the country was the group known as &quot;Los Contemporáneos,&quot; (The Contemporaries) who emerged during the 1930s. This group was formed by the journalist Salvador Novo and the poets Xavier Villaurrutia and José Gorostiza. By the second half of the 20th century, Mexican literature had diversified in themes, styles, and genres. New groups emerged, such as &quot;La Onda&quot; in the 1960s, which advocated for urban, satirical, and defiant literature. Among the notable authors were Parménides García Saldaña and José Agustín, as well as the group known as &quot;La Mafia,&quot; which included Carlos Fuentes, Salvador Elizondo, José Emilio Pacheco, Carlos Monsiváis, Inés Arredondo, Fernando Benítez, and others. The &quot;Infrarrealistas&quot; (Infrarealists) of the 1970s aimed to &quot;blow the lid off official culture.&quot; In 1990, Octavio Paz became the only Mexican to date to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

In present-day, Mexican literature continues to thrive, with writers like Elena Poniatowska, Yuri Herrera, and Valeria Luiselli exploring themes of migration, urban life, and social justice with depth and nuance. Their works, alongside those of emerging voices, ensure that the tradition remains vibrant and relevant in the 21st century. Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor is a fiction novel that has made a significant impact on contemporary Mexican literature. Through its compelling narrative and exploration of societal issues, the book has garnered critical acclaim and contributed to ongoing literary discussions.
== Introduction ==

Mexico&#x27;s literature has its antecedents in the literatures of the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica and the literary traditions of Spain. With the arrival of the Spanish, a new literature was produced through &quot;mestizaje&quot;, which made way for a period of creolization of literature in the newly established Viceroyalty of New Spain. The literature of New Spain was highly influenced by the Spanish Renaissance, which was represented in all the Spanish literature of the time, and local productions also incorporated numerous terms commonly used in the vernacular of the viceroyalty and some of the topics discussed in the works of the period shaped a distinctive variant of the Spanish literature produced in Mexico.

During the colonial era, New Spain was home to Baroque writers such as Bernardo de Balbuena, Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, Juan Ruiz de Alarcón, Francisco de Castro, Luis Sandoval Zapata, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Diego de Ribera and Rafael Landivar. Towards the independence a new wave of writers gave the initial struggle for the emancipation of national literature from the literature of the Spanish peninsula: Diego José Abad, Francisco Javier Alegre and Friar Servando Teresa de Mier.

Towards the end of colonial rule in New Spain arose figures like José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, &quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot; is considered as an emblem of the Mexican literature and the first modern novel written in the Americas. By the second half of that century, works like Los mexicanos pintados por sí mismos, a manners book that gives a rough idea of how intellectuals of the time saw the rest of his countrymen. Towards the end of the century, during the Porfirio Diaz government, Mexican writers inclined towards the dominant European trends of the time.

To celebrate the centenary of the Independence of Mexico, there was a literary project surged &quot;Antología del Centenario&quot; which aimed to collect authors of the first hundred years of Mexico. This was truncated and only the first volume was published in two volumes primarily consisting of collected poetry. The poets of the time that were included were Friar Manuel de Navarrete, Fernando Calderón, Ignacio Rodríguez Galván. Notable modernists of the time included Amado Nervo and Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera. Other notable authors of that time were Luis G. Urbina, Efren Rebolledo, José Juan Tablada, Enrique González Martínez and Ramón López Velarde.

The emergence of the Mexican Revolution favored the development of journalistic genre. After the civil conflict finished, the Revolution theme appeared as a theme in many novels, short stories and plays like those of Mariano Azuela or Rodolfo Usigli. This trend would be an antecedent for the flowering of &#x27;revolutionary literature&#x27;, which was embodied in the work of writers like Rosario Castellanos or Juan Rulfo. A literature of indigenous themes, which aimed to portray the thoughts and life of the indigenous peoples of Mexico surged along with this revolutionary literature, although ironically, none of the writers were indigenous. The most notable indigenist authors of the time included Miguel Angel Menendez Reyes, Ricardo Pozas and Francisco Rojas González.

In alternative to these mainstream literature, also other literary styles were developed in the country, less known movements being outside the main focus. Among them, the &quot;estridentistas&quot; (1920s) that included authors such as Arqueles Vela and Manuel Maples Arce. Another relevant movement to the literary history of the country was a group of intellectuals known as &quot;Los Contemporáneos&quot; (1930s), which unified figures such as journalist Salvador Novo and poets like Xavier Villaurrutia and José Gorostiza.

During the second half of 20th century, Mexican literature had diversified into themes, styles and genres. There were new groups such as &quot;Literatura de la Onda&quot; (1960s), which sought for an urban, satirical and rebellious literature; among the featured authors were Parmenides García Saldaña and José Agustín; another literary style surged called &quot;Infrarrealismo&quot; (1970s), which sought to &quot;blow his brains out the official culture&quot;; &quot;La mafia cultural&quot; (1960s), was composed of Carlos Fuentes, Salvador Elizondo, José Emilio Pacheco, Carlos Monsivais, Inés Arredondo, Fernando Benítez among others. In 1990, Octavio Paz became the only Mexican to date to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

==Pre-Columbian literature==

While the peoples of Mesoamerica developed systems of writing, these were not often used to preserve their literature. Most of the myths and literary works of the indigenous peoples of Mexico were transmitted by oral tradition. The peoples of Mesoamerica, despite having developed writing systems, primarily employed pictographic and logosyllabic forms rather than a phonetic writing system. Among these expressions, the Borgia Group codices are regarded by some scholars as exceptional artistic and literary works. While there is scholarly disagreement, it is commonly accepted that the central section of the Codex Borgia contains a narrative related to the creation of the universe, although an alternate hypothesis suggests that it may depict a series of rituals with an unclear purpose.

In addition to the Codex Borgia, the Mixtec codices Becker 1, Nutall, and Colombino depict the life of the hero-ruler 8-Venado and his efforts towards the unification of the Mixtec people. Another significant manuscript, the Boturini Codex or &quot;Pilgrimage Strip,&quot; recounts chapters of the Mexicas&#x27; migration from northern Mexico to their eventual settlement in Texcoco Lake. However, it is worth noting that some scholars argue that the Boturini Codex is a copy of an older, unidentified document created during the early stages of the Conquest.

Within the rich cultural tapestry of ancient Mexico, a multitude of ceramic artifacts, stone carvings, stelae, and monoliths bear witness to historical, mythical-genealogical, cosmogonic, and legendary narratives. Notably, the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mayas, Nahua, and Mixtec peoples have produced remarkable pieces that capture the imagination.

The Olmecs, often credited as the originators of complex civilizations in Mesoamerica, are associated with the oldest known stone writing. Among their relics, a gravel block named &#x27;Bloque de Cascajal&#x27; in Spanish is adorned with glyphs and has been carbon-dated to approximately 3,000 years ago, making it a significant archaeological find. This discovery sheds light on the early development of written communication in the region, highlighting the Olmecs&#x27; sophisticated cultural achievements.

We know that one of the activities that were to dominate the novices of priests among the Mexica was the memorization of lyrical works or mythology of their people.

Some of these productions were permanently fixed by writing them down using the Latin alphabet that the missionaries of the 16th century used to transcribe the information they received from the native inhabitants. Modern scholars such as Angel Maria Garibay K. and Miguel Leon-Portilla, have translated these works which were once dispersed in several texts and have reunited or reviewed these works in publications such as in &quot;&quot;Visión de los vencidos. Relaciones indígenas de la Conquista&quot; or &quot;Historia de la literatura Náhuatl.&quot;&quot;

The works of Spanish missionaries in central Mexico contributed to the preservation of the oral tradition of the Nahuatl speaking peoples by writing them down on paper using the Latin alphabet. In this regard the lyrical works of Acolmiztli Nezahualcoyotl (1402–1472), tlatoani of Texcoco, were preserved and passed down to posterity giving the author the title of &quot;Poet King&quot;. His works, along with other nobles of the nahuatlaca peoples of the Altiplano such as Ayocuan of Chalco-Atenco, and Tecayehuatzin of Huexotzinco, constitute the largest sample of pre-Columbian works and philosophical lyrics preserved into the modern era.

There are also smaller stocks of Postclassic Era literature recovered among other peoples such as the Purépecha, the Zapotec and Mixtec. The Case of the Mixtec is special as four codices have been preserved which have led to an approach to the study of the history of these people under the imprint of Eight Deer, Lord of Tututepec and Tilantongo. In the Mayan world there are preserved fragments called Books of Chilam Balam.

Another well known pre-Columbian literature is that of the Quiché people who did not inhabit the current Mexican territory, but rather, lived in what is now Guatemala. The Popol Vuh (Book of Counsel) was written in the Quiché language and incorporates two Mayan cosmogonical myths: the creation of the world and falling of Hunahpu and Xbalanque into Xibalba which is the underworld of the Maya.

Outside of Mesoamerica, Arturo Warman forwarded the hypothesis that the verses sung by the Yaquis and Mayo musicians during the performance of the Danza del Venado have their origin in pre-Columbian times and have survived to this day with very little change since then.

Among the prehispanic literature which flourished are:

* Epic Poetry which chronicles the life of famous people such as Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl, the founding of cities and pilgrimages of tribes.
* Lyric poetry of religious, military or philosophical context.
* Dramatic poetry, which mixed elements of music and dance, as the feast of Tezcatlipoca.
* Historical Prose and didactic genealogies, also proverbs called &quot;Huehuetlatolli&quot; (&quot;The sayings of the old&quot;).

==Spanish colonial period==
In the colonial literature of Mexico we can distinguish several periods. The first period is linked with the historical moment of conquest, it chronicles and letters abound.

===16th century===

The influence of indigenous themes in the literature of New Spain is evident in the incorporation of many terms commonly used in the common local tongue of the people in colonial Mexico as well as some of the topics touched in the works of the period which reflected local views and cultures. During this period, New Spain housed writers such as Bernardo de Balbuena.

In the colonial literature of Mexico we can distinguish several periods. The first examples of literature are linked with the historical moment of conquest, colonization chronicles and letters.

===17th century===
In this period flourished particularly the Mexican variant of the Baroque literature. Many of the most famous authors of the century reached varying success in the area of literary games, with works like anagrams, emblems and mazes. There were notable authors in poetry, lyric, narrative and drama. The Baroque literature in New Spain followed the rivers of Spanish writers Góngora and Quevedo.

===18th century===
Towards the end of the colonial period emerged important figures such as José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, whose &quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot;, is considered emblematic of Mexican picaresque alongside other of his novels such as &quot;La Quijotita y su Prima&quot; and &quot;Don Catrín dela Fachenda&quot; represented the first novels written in the Americas.

== Writers of independent Mexico (19th century) ==

Due to the political instability of the 19th century, Mexico—already an independent nation—saw a decline not only in its literature but in the other arts as well. During the second half of the 19th century, Mexican literature became revitalized with works such as &quot;Los Mexicanos Pintados Por Si Mismos&quot;, a book that gives us an approximate idea of how intellectuals of the period saw their contemporaries. Towards the end of the century Mexican writers adopted the common tendencies of the period. Two modernist poets that stand out are Amado Nervo and Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera.

During the 19th century there were three major literary trends: romanticism, realism-naturalism and modernism.

Romantic writers gathered around hundreds of associations; among the most important the Academy Lateran, founded in 1836 (José María Lacunza, Guillermo Prieto, Manuel Carpio, Andrés Quintana Roo, José Joaquín Pesado, Ignacio Rodríguez Galván (Ignacio Ramirez). Liceo Hidalgo, was another prominent literary association founded in 1850, (Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Manuel Acuña, Manuel M. Flores). Unto whom it was labeled as neo-classical or academic, as opposed to the category of &quot;romantic&quot; that was given to the former authors. Other authors belong to this group such as José Manuel Martínez de Navarrete, Vicente Riva Palacio, Joaquin Arcadio Caspian, Justo Sierra and Manuel Jose Othon.

Later, during the rise of positivism aesthetic taste changed. Between realists and naturalists Mexican writers were Luis G. Inclán, Rafael Delgado, Emilio Rabasa, José Tomás de Cuéllar, Federico Gamboa and Ángel de Campo.

Within the modernist superman, original literary revolution in Latin America, there were numerous metrics and rhyming innovations, revival of obsolete forms and mainly symbolic findings. Between 1895 and 1910 Mexico became a core of modernist activity; among famous writers there were Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera, Enrique González Martínez, Salvador Díaz Mirón and Amado Nervo.

==Contemporary Writers (20th and 21st centuries)==

The inception of the Mexican Revolution favored the growth of the journalistic genre. Once the civil conflict ended, the theme of the Revolution appeared as a theme in novels, stories and plays by Mariano Azuela and Rodolfo Usigli. This tendency would anticipate the flowering of a nationalist literature, which took shape in the works of writers such as Rosario Castellanos and Juan Rulfo. There also appeared on the scene an &quot;indigenous literature,&quot; which purported to depict the life and thought of the indigenous peoples of Mexico, although, ironically, none of the authors of this movement were indigenous. Among them Ricardo Pozas and Francisco Rojas Gonzalez stand out.

There also developed less mainstream movements such as that of the &quot;Estridentistas&quot;, with figures that include Arqueles Vela and Manuel Maples Arce (1920s). Other literary movements include that of Los Contemporáneos, which was represented by writers like Salvador Novo, Xavier Villaurrutia and José Gorostiza. Towards the end of the 20th century Mexican literature had become diversified in themes, styles and genres. In 1990 Octavio Paz became the first Mexican—and up until this point the only one—to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.

In the years between 1900 and 1914 it continued to dominate modernism in poetry and prose realism and naturalism. During this period lived representatives 19th-century literature with members of the Ateneo´s youth.

From 1915 to 1930 there were three streams: a stylistic renewal incorporating influences from the European vanguard (the estridentismo (Manuel Maples Arce, German List Arzubide, Arqueles Vela) and Contemporaries), a group of writers resumed colonial subjects (Xavier Villaurrutia, Jaime Torres Bodet, Jorge Cuesta, José Gorostiza, Salvador Novo), and others who began publishing calls &quot;novels of the Revolution &quot;(the best known is &quot; the Underdogs &quot; of Mariano Azuela): Martin Luis Guzman, Rafael Muñoz, Heriberto Frías, Jorge Ferretis, Nellie Campobello.

Until the mid-1940s there were authors who continued realistic narrative, but also reached their peak the indigenista novel and reflections involved around on self and national culture. Emerged two new poetic generations, grouped around the magazines &quot;Taller y Tierra Nueva&quot;.

With the publication of Agustín Yáñez&#x27;s &quot;Al filo del agua&quot; in 1947 began what we call &quot;contemporary Mexican novel&quot; incorporating innovative techniques, influences of American writers such as (William Faulkner and John Dos Passos), and European influences from (James Joyce and Franz Kafka), and in 1963, the hitherto known for his articles in newspapers and magazines and its beautiful theater Elena Garro, published which became the initiator of the &quot; boom &quot; Latin American and founder of the genre known as &quot;magical realism&quot;: the novel &quot; Recollections of Things to Come &quot;, which inspired the Colombian Gabriel García Márquez to write his most celebrated &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. While during the period from 1947 to 1961 predominated the narrators (Arreola, Rulfo, Fuentes), then emerged poets worth as Rubén Bonifaz Nuño and Rosario Castellanos (also narrator).

In 1960 an anthology was edited &quot;La espiga amotinada&quot;, which brought together the major group of poets: Juan Banuelos, Oscar Oliva, Jaime Augusto Shelley, Eraclius Zepeda and Jaime Labastida. Literary magazines were one of the main vehicles for disseminating the writers, so they tend to group many of them under the name of the journals in which they were active. &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; was directed by Xavier Villaurrutia, the group &quot;Los Contemporaneos&quot; who had Octavio Paz as a coolaborador. Octavio Paz, after leaving founded the newspaper &quot;Excelsior&quot;, a magazine called &quot;Vuelta&quot;, which led for many years the national culture, mainly after the death of Martin Luis Guzman in 1976.

After the death of Octavio Paz, a group of his contributors tried to start a magazine, but the fledgling magazine, &quot;Letras libres&quot;, failed to have the acceptance of &quot;Vuelta&quot;.
In 1979, Gabriel Zaid made a census of poets published in his anthology &quot;Assembly of young poets of Mexico&quot;; among those who were included, there were poets as Eduardo Hurtado, Alberto Blanco, Coral Bracho, Eduardo Casar, Eduardo Langagne, Manuel Ulacia, Vicente Quirarte, Victor Manuel Mendiola, Dante Medina, Veronica Volkow, Pearl Schwartz, Jaime Moreno Villarreal and Francisco Segovia. These and the other authors included are those who currently make up the group of authors at the peak of his literary career. Most worked in &quot;Vuelta&quot;.
Present-day notable Mexican poets include Elsa Cross and Efraín Bartolomé.

Influenced by the mass media, social networks, and the Internet, the generation born in the 80s and 90s exhibits a strong inclination towards literature, which finds expression in various digital and print media platforms, such as blogs, internet pages, digital and printed magazines, and electronic books. The impact of this generation on the literary landscape is still challenging to trace. Nonetheless, their presence is evident through the emergence of literary creation schools established in recent decades, including Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana (UCSJ), Casa Lamm, Centro Morelense de las Artes (CMA), Sociedad General de Escritores de México (Sogem), and Escuela Mexicana de Escritores (EME).

Within this vast and dynamic generation of young and prolific writers, certain individuals have garnered attention for their literary contributions. Among them are Fernanda Melchor, Mercedes Alvarado, Martín Rangel, Aldo Vicencio, Davo Valdez, Iván Cruz, Juan Andrés Herrera, Víctor Ibarra (known by their pseudonyms Genkidama Ñu and Vraiux Dorós), Tania Carrera, Joana Medellín Herrero, Tania Langarica, Itzel Nayelli Palacios, Andrea Chaves, Rojo Córdova, Yaxkin Melchy, Karlos Atl, and many others. While the full extent of their impact is yet to be determined, these individuals represent the active and visible facet of this vast generation of aspiring writers

<text>Fred F. Steen II served as the chief lobbyist/legislative liaison for North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory until 2016 when McCrory appointed him to the Board of Review. From 2004 through 2012, Steen served as a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s 76th House District, including constituents in Rowan County. A cost analyst from Landis, North Carolina, he served as the town&#x27;s mayor for eight years until he was appointed on 16 February 2004 to fill the seat of W. Eugene McCombs, who died in office.

<text>Afterglow is a 1997 American comedy-drama film directed and written by Alan Rudolph and starring Nick Nolte, Julie Christie, Lara Flynn Boyle and Jonny Lee Miller. It was produced by Robert Altman and filmed in Montreal.

Christie&#x27;s performance earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The film is about two married couples who end up attracted to each other&#x27;s partners.

==Plot==
The lives of two unhappily married couples intertwine in Montreal, Canada. The marriage between Lucky Mann, a contractor and his beautiful British wife, former actress Phyllis Hart, has been in a poor state for years. Their relationship fell apart when Phyllis revealed to Lucky that their daughter Cassie was not his biological child. She had her with an actor while Lucky was in the Navy. Cassie ran away to Montreal, and they have not spoken in years. The Manns moved from California to Montreal to find Cassie, but without success. Phyllis is depressed after learning that her daughter&#x27;s father, actor Jack Dana, recently died. She begins to question her own mortality and goes to see a doctor for a checkup. She also spends her time watching her old films that she starred in with Dana. Phyllis knows Lucky cheats on her with his construction clients, and therefore they have a silent agreement that they will not have sex. Lucky is shown cheating on her with Gloria Marino.

Meanwhile, corporate executive Jeffrey Byron and his wife Marianne are also unhappily married. Marianne desires children and is starved of affection by Jeffrey, who seems only to be in love with himself. Jeffrey is depressed and seems to be contemplating his sexuality and, perhaps, suicide. One day after work, Marianne tries to get Jeffrey to have sex with her because she is ovulating, but he denies her. She decides to start preparing a room for a baby in their condo anyway and hires a contractor, who happens to be Lucky Mann, referred to her by her friend Isabel&#x27;s mother Gloria. She is instantly attracted to him, and they begin an affair. Jeffrey meets Phyllis in a bar where Phyllis had just witnessed Marianne and Lucky on a date. Jeffrey is instantly attracted to Phyllis and seems to have a need to be with an older woman after having shown a sudden attraction to his older secretary, Helene. Marianne is attracted to the older and rugged Lucky. Jeffrey invites Phyllis away for a weekend at a resort. She initially says no and goes home to Lucky. Phyllis tries to sleep with Lucky and he brushes her off, so she tells him that she knows about Marianne. She ends up meeting Jeffrey and going away with him. Once they are at the resort, they meet up with Jeffrey&#x27;s big cheese client, Bernard Ornay and his mistress Monica Bloom. Ornay also becomes attracted to Phyllis which causes a rift with Jeffrey. Jeffrey and Phyllis look likely to sleep together in her room, but Jeffrey terminates contact after Phyllis responds flirtatiously when Ornay knocks on her door. They leave the resort the next morning.

The two couples end up in the same hotel bar, and Jeffrey and Lucky have a physical fight. Marianne and Phyllis leave together and go back to the Byrons&#x27; apartment, where Marianne reveals she is pregnant with Lucky&#x27;s baby. Marianne does not know yet that Phyllis is his wife. Phyllis becomes upset and leaves. Jeffrey and Marianne have sex and reconcile. Lucky finds Cassie and they reconcile. At the end of the story, the same thing that had happened to Phyllis has happened to Marianne. They will both have raised a child with another man that is not the father. Marianne tells her friend Isabel the baby&#x27;s father is Jeffrey, which reveals she does not plan on telling Lucky that it is his, just as Phyllis had done with Jack Dana.

<text>The Republican Left () was a Spanish republican party founded in 1934.

==History==
The party was founded in 1934 following the left&#x27;s defeat in the 1933 election, by the merger of Manuel Azaña&#x27;s Republican Action, part of Marcelino Domingo&#x27;s Independent Radical Socialist Republican Party and Santiago Casares Quiroga&#x27;s Autonomous Galician Republican Organization (ORGA). Its members included José Giral, Victoria Kent, and Manuel Azaña, who became the party&#x27;s leader.

Integrated in the Popular Front ahead of the 1936 election. Azaña became President of the Council of Ministers. Following the impeachment of Niceto Alcalá Zamora from the presidency in May 1936, Azaña was elected President, an office he held until his resignation in February 1939. He was succeeded as President of the Council first by Casares Quiroga] and then by Giral. Later, alongside the Republican Union, the party was the main component of the Largo Caballero government in September 1936, at the start of the Spanish Civil War. The IR participated in all republican governments till the end of the civil war.

In exile in Mexico, the IR was the main support of the Republican government-in-exile until it was dissolved in 1959 to found the Spanish Democratic Republican Action. A party taking the name Republican Left was founded in 1977 and has achieved no major electoral success yet.

<doc id="509001" wikidata="Q361909" url="?curid=509001" title="Republican National Convention">
<text>The Republican National Convention (RNC) is a series of presidential nominating conventions held every four years since 1856 by the Republican Party in the United States. They are administered by the Republican National Committee. The goal of the Republican National Convention is to officially nominate and confirm a candidate for president and vice president, adopt a comprehensive party platform and unify the party, as well as publicize and launch the fall campaign. 

Delegates from all fifty U.S. states and from American dependencies and territories, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, attend the convention and cast their votes. Like the Democratic National Convention, the Republican National Convention marks the formal end of the primary election period and the start of the general election season. In 2020, all parties replaced the usual conventions with short online programs.

==History==
The Republican Party was formally organized on a national basis at a meeting in Lafayette Hall in Pittsburgh on February 22–23, 1856, during which the first Republican National Committee was elected.

===First nominating convention===
The first Republican National Convention was the 1856 Republican National Convention, held from June 17 to 19, 1856, at Musical Fund Hall at 808 Locust Street in Philadelphia. At the 1856 Republican National Convention, the party nominated John C. Frémont, a U.S. Senator from California for president and William L. Dayton, a former U.S. Senator from New Jersey for vice president.

===1864 convention===

The 1864 event, with the American Civil War raging, was branded as the &quot;National Union Convention&quot; since it included Democrats who remained loyal to the Union and nominated Andrew Johnson, who had been elected Governor of Tennessee as a Democrat, for vice president. By 1868 the usual Republican name was restored.

===20th century===
The 1912 Republican National Convention saw the business-oriented faction supporting William Howard Taft turn back a challenge from former President Theodore Roosevelt, who boasted broader popular support and even won a primary in Taft&#x27;s home state of Ohio. Roosevelt would run on the Progressive Party ticket, splitting the Republicans and thereby handing the election to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. The 1924 Republican National Convention made history by being the first GOP convention to give women equal representation. This was the first time the Republican Convention was held in Cleveland, Ohio. It was also the first time any convention was broadcast over radio – to nine cities through a special link over long-distance telephone lines. The Republican National Committee approved a rule providing for a national committee-man and a national committee-woman from each state. Incumbent President Calvin Coolidge was formally nominated and went on to win the general election. The convention nominated Illinois Governor Frank Lowden for vice president on the second ballot, but he declined the nomination. This is the only time a nominee refused to accept a vice presidential nomination.

The Republicans returned to the city in 1936 in the cavernous Cleveland Public Auditorium. Former President Herbert Hoover addressed the delegates on the second day of the convention. On the third, Alf Landon of Kansas (who did not attend) was nominated for president; Colonel Frank Knox was nominated as the vice presidential candidate. Landon and Knox were defeated in a landslide by Franklin D. Roosevelt and John Nance Garner. Knox subsequently served as Secretary of the Navy in the administration of Roosevelt. The 1940 Republican National Convention was the first national convention of any party broadcast on live television. It was carried by an early version of the NBC Television Network and consisted of flagship W2XBS (now WNBC) in New York City, W3XE (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia and W2XB (now WRGB) in Schenectady and Albany.

The growing importance of primaries became evident at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, where U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona won the nomination, easily turning away Pennsylvania governor William Scranton and others more favorable to the party establishment.

At the 1972 Republican National Convention, Pat Nixon became the first First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt and the first Republican First Lady to deliver an address to the convention delegates. It is now common practice for the presidential candidate&#x27;s spouse to deliver an address to the delegates. Also in 1972, the placing of &quot;favorite son&quot; candidates&#x27; names into nomination was banned, requiring at least five states&#x27; requests to do so. In recent years, only one candidate&#x27;s name has been put into nomination, and challengers have been put under intense pressure to withdraw in order for the vote to be unanimous.

An exception was when former California Governor Ronald Reagan nearly toppled incumbent President Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention in Kansas City. Ford was in office for only two years before he was challenged by Reagan, who was a fellow Republican. Reagan was on record saying that fellow Republicans should never talk badly about one another, but Reagan&#x27;s view had since changed, but the power of incumbency was too much for Reagan to overcome. This was the last GOP convention where the outcome of the nomination was in doubt. After the Republican National Convention, the pressure was on Ford to cut away the factionalism in his Republican Party.

Pat Buchanan delivered a speech enthusiastically endorsing the conservative side of the culture war in American society at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston. It was widely criticized for supposedly alienating liberal and moderate voters who might otherwise have voted for the moderate nominee and then-incumbent President George H. W. Bush. Division in the party was evident too at the 1996 Republican National Convention, at which more moderate party members such as California governor Pete Wilson and Massachusetts governor William Weld unsuccessfully sought to remove the Human Life Amendment plank from the party platform. The event at the San Diego Convention Center remains the last Republican National Convention to be held in a convention center complex; all others since then have been held at sports stadiums or arenas.

===21st century===
The Republican Party chose Cleveland again as the site for the 2016 Republican National Convention. The convention was held in Quicken Loans Arena, home of the Cleveland Cavaliers. There may have been political considerations in the selection, since no Republican has won the presidency without winning Ohio since Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 election. Cuyahoga County has voted 19 times for Republicans and 21 times for the Democratic candidate since 1856. However, the Democrats had carried the county for the past 40 years.

The party chose Charlotte, North Carolina as the location for its 2020 Republican National Convention, but pulled out at the last minute. President Donald Trump announced the convention would be moved to Jacksonville, Florida, but subsequently cancelled the Jacksonville convention plans amidst COVID-19 pandemic concerns and complications on July 23. The convention proceedings were then held remotely from various locations, with the final day taking place on the South Lawn of the White House.

==Delegations==
The party&#x27;s presidential nominee is chosen primarily by pledged delegates, which are in turn selected through a series of individual state caucuses and primary elections. The size of delegations to the Republican National Convention, for each state, territory, or other political subdivision, are described by Rule 14 of the party&#x27;s national rules. The party does not use superdelegates as does the Democratic Party, and all delegates are pledged to a candidate in some fashion.

The Republican Party&#x27;s rules leave discretion to the states in choosing how to award their respective pledged delegates to the candidates. Some states may use a statewide winner-take-all method, where the primary candidate who receives the most popular votes in a state gets all of its pledged delegates. Other states may use a proportional representation system, where the pledged delegates are instead distributed to the candidates in proportion to its votes.

;Pledged party leaders
Three leaders of each state, territory, and Washington D.C.&#x27;s Republican Party (its national committeeman, its national committeewoman and its chairperson) are automatically nominated as pledged delegates to the national convention.

;Base allocation formula for the 50 U.S. states
Since 2012, the number of pledged delegates initially allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states is: Ten at-large delegates, plus three district delegates for each of the state&#x27;s congressional districts. As each state has at least one congressional district, the minimum number of delegates from this allocation for any state is 13.

;Base allocations to other jurisdictions
Jurisdictions with non-voting congressmembers are instead given a fixed amount of pledged at-large delegates. In 2020, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands each get six at-large delegates; Puerto Rico receives 20; and Washington, D.C., gets 16.

;Bonus delegates
The Republican Party awards bonus pledged delegates to each jurisdiction based on two main factors (where applicable): whether its electoral college votes went to the Republican candidate in the last presidential election, and on how well the state party has done in electing Republicans to state and congressional elections.

# For each state that cast at least a majority of its Electoral College votes for the Republican nominee in the 2016 election, that state earns an additional four and one-half delegates at-large for the 2020 convention, plus a number of the delegates at-large equal to 60 percent of the number of electoral votes of that state; all fractions are rounded upwards. If Washington DC had gone Republican instead of Democratic in 2016, it itself would have received an additional four and one-half delegates at-large, plus a number of delegates at-large equal to 30 percent of its base allocation of 16 at-large delegates (rounding up to 10 bonus delegates).
# States and territories get additional bonus at-large delegates in 2020 (where applicable) based on whether it has elected Republicans to the following state and federal offices in the 2016 elections or at any subsequent election (whether the 2018 midterms, or the 2017 or 2019 off-year elections) held prior to January 1, 2020:
#* Republican governor: 1 additional at-large delegate
#* Republican majorities in its state legislature: 1 for each chamber that has a Republican majority and has a Republican presiding officer (if the presiding officer is elected by the chamber); maximum 2 if Republicans control all chambers of the state legislature
#* At least one-half Republican membership in its delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives: 1
#* Republican membership in the U.S. Senate: 1 for each Republican senator; maximum 2 if both the state&#x27;s senators are Republican

The bonus delegates thus reward states that vote for Republican candidates and punish those which do not. As examples, for the 2020 Convention using California and Texas (the two most populous states, California being a Democratic stronghold and Texas a Republican one):
*Texas received 34 bonus delegates, winning the available bonus delegates in all five categories: Donald Trump won a majority of the state&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2016 election (36 with two faithless electors, earning it 28 bonus delegates as the delegate formula does not take those into account), Greg Abbott was the Governor (one bonus delegate), the Republicans controlled both chambers of the Texas Legislature (two bonus delegates), the Republicans had over half of Texas&#x27; Congressional delegation (one bonus delegate), and both senatorsJohn Cornyn and Ted Cruz were Republicans (two bonus delegates).
*Conversely, California received zero bonus delegates: Joe Biden won the state&#x27;s electoral votes, Gavin Newsom was the Governor, Democrats controlled both chambers of the California General Assembly, and both senatorsDianne Feinstein and Kamala Harriswere Democrats

==Candidate nomination==
The candidate nomination process at the convention is governed by Rule 40 of the party&#x27;s national rules. Under Rule 40(b), a candidate must have the support of a majority of the delegates of at least five delegations in order to get the 2020 nomination.

<text>In number theory, a formula for primes is a formula generating the prime numbers, exactly and without exception. Formulas for calculating primes do exist; however, they are computationally very slow. A number of constraints are known, showing what such a &quot;formula&quot; can and cannot be.

==Formulas based on Wilson&#x27;s theorem==

A simple formula is
:formula_1
for positive integer formula_2, where formula_3 is the floor function, which rounds down to the nearest integer.
By Wilson&#x27;s theorem, formula_4 is prime if and only if formula_5. Thus, when formula_4 is prime, the first factor in the product becomes one, and the formula produces the prime number formula_4. But when formula_4 is not prime, the first factor becomes zero and the formula produces the prime number 2.
This formula is not an efficient way to generate prime numbers because evaluating formula_9 requires about formula_10 multiplications and reductions modulo formula_4.

In 1964, Willans gave the formula
:formula_12
for the formula_2th prime number formula_14.
This formula reduces to formula_15; that is, it tautologically defines formula_14 as the smallest integer &quot;m&quot; for which the prime-counting function formula_17 is at least &quot;n&quot;. This formula is also not efficient. In addition to the appearance of formula_18, it computes formula_14 by adding up formula_14 copies of formula_21; for example, formula_22.

The articles &quot;What is an Answer?&quot; by Herbert Wilf (1982) and &quot;Formulas for Primes&quot; by Underwood Dudley (1983) have further discussion about the worthlessness of such formulas.

==Formula based on a system of Diophantine equations==
Because the set of primes is a computably enumerable set, by Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem, it can be obtained from a system of Diophantine equations. found an explicit set of 14 Diophantine equations in 26 variables, such that a given number &quot;k&quot; + 2 is prime if and only if that system has a solution in nonnegative integers:

: formula_23

: formula_24

: formula_25

: formula_26

: formula_27

: formula_28

: formula_29

: formula_30

: formula_31

: formula_32

: formula_33

: formula_34

: formula_35

:formula_36

The 14 equations &quot;α&quot;0, …, &quot;α&quot;13 can be used to produce a prime-generating polynomial inequality in 26 variables:

:formula_37

That is,

: formula_38

is a polynomial inequality in 26 variables, and the set of prime numbers is identical to the set of positive values taken on by the left-hand side as the variables &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, …, &quot;z&quot; range over the nonnegative integers.

A general theorem of Matiyasevich says that if a set is defined by a system of Diophantine equations, it can also be defined by a system of Diophantine equations in only 9 variables. Hence, there is a prime-generating polynomial inequality as above with only 10 variables. However, its degree is large (in the order of 1045). On the other hand, there also exists such a set of equations of degree only 4, but in 58 variables.

==Mills&#x27; formula==
The first such formula known was established by , who proved that there exists a real number &quot;A&quot; such that, if

:formula_39

then

:formula_40

is a prime number for all positive integers &quot;n&quot;. If the Riemann hypothesis is true, then the smallest such &quot;A&quot; has a value of around 1.3063778838630806904686144926... and is known as Mills&#x27; constant. This value gives rise to the primes formula_41, formula_42, formula_43, ... . Very little is known about the constant &quot;A&quot; (not even whether it is rational). This formula has no practical value, because there is no known way of calculating the constant without finding primes in the first place.

There is nothing special about the floor function in the formula. Tóth proved that there also exists a constant formula_44 such that

:formula_45

is also prime-representing for formula_46.

In the case formula_47, the value of the constant formula_44 begins with 1.24055470525201424067... The first few primes generated are:

:formula_49
:formula_50

&quot;Without&quot; assuming the Riemann hypothesis, Elsholtz developed several prime-representing functions similar to those of Mills. For example, if formula_51, then formula_52 is prime for all positive integers formula_2. Similarly, if formula_54, then formula_55 is prime for all positive integers formula_2.

==Wright&#x27;s formula==
Another tetrationally growing prime-generating formula similar to Mills&#x27; comes from a theorem of E. M. Wright. He proved that there exists a real number &quot;α&quot; such that, if
:formula_57 and
:formula_58 for formula_59,
then
:formula_60
is prime for all formula_61.
Wright gives the first seven decimal places of such a constant: formula_62. This value gives rise to the primes formula_63, formula_64, and formula_65. formula_66 is even, and so is not prime. However, with formula_67, formula_68, formula_69, and formula_70 are unchanged, while formula_66 is a prime with 4932 digits. This sequence of primes cannot be extended beyond formula_66 without knowing more digits of formula_73. Like Mills&#x27; formula, and for the same reasons, Wright&#x27;s formula cannot be used to find primes.

==A function that represents all primes==
Given the constant formula_74 , for formula_75, define the sequence

where formula_76 is the floor function.
Then for formula_61, formula_78 equals the formula_2th prime:
formula_80,
formula_81,
formula_82, etc.

The initial constant formula_83 given in the article is precise enough for equation () to generate the primes through 37, the formula_84th prime.

The &quot;exact&quot; value of formula_85 that generates &quot;all&quot; primes is given by the rapidly-converging series
:formula_86
where formula_14 is the formula_2th prime, and formula_89 is the product of all primes less than formula_14. The more digits of formula_85 that we know, the more primes equation () will generate. For example, we can use 25 terms in the series, using the 25 primes less than 100, to calculate the following more precise approximation:
: formula_92
This has enough digits for equation () to yield again the 25 primes less than 100.

As with Mills&#x27; formula and Wright&#x27;s formula above, in order to generate a longer list of primes, we need to start by knowing more digits of the initial constant, formula_85, which in this case requires a longer list of primes in its calculation.

==Plouffe&#x27;s formulas==
In 2018 Simon Plouffe conjectured a set of formulas for primes. Similarly to the formula of Mills, they are of the form

:formula_94

where formula_95 is the function rounding to the nearest integer. For example, with formula_96 and formula_97, this gives 113, 367, 1607, 10177, 102217... . Using formula_98 and formula_99 with formula_100 a certain number between 0 and one half, Plouffe found that he could generate a sequence of 50 probable primes (with high probability of being prime). Presumably there exists an ε such that this formula will give an infinite sequence of actual prime numbers. The number of digits starts at 501 and increases by about 1% each time.

==Prime formulas and polynomial functions==

=== Eulers&#x27;s polynomial ===

It is known that no non-constant polynomial function &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) with integer coefficients exists that evaluates to a prime number for all integers &quot;n&quot;. The proof is as follows: suppose that such a polynomial existed. Then &quot;P&quot;(1) would evaluate to a prime &quot;p&quot;, so formula_101. But for any integer &quot;k&quot;, formula_102 also, so formula_103 cannot also be prime (as it would be divisible by &quot;p&quot;) unless it were &quot;p&quot; itself. But the only way formula_104 for all &quot;k&quot; is if the polynomial function is constant.
The same reasoning shows an even stronger result: no non-constant polynomial function &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) exists that evaluates to a prime number for almost all integers &quot;n&quot;.

Euler first noticed (in 1772) that the quadratic polynomial

:formula_105

is prime for the 40 integers &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ..., 39, with corresponding primes 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, ..., 1601. The differences between the terms are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10... For &quot;n&quot; = 40, it produces a square number, 1681, which is equal to 41 × 41, the smallest composite number for this formula for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0. If 41 divides &quot;n&quot;, it divides &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) too. Furthermore, since &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) can be written as &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; + 1) + 41, if 41 divides &quot;n&quot; + 1 instead, it also divides &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). The phenomenon is related to the Ulam spiral, which is also implicitly quadratic, and the class number; this polynomial is related to the Heegner number formula_106. There are analogous polynomials for formula_107 (the lucky numbers of Euler), corresponding to other Heegner numbers.

Given a positive integer &quot;S&quot;, there may be infinitely many &quot;c&quot; such that the expression &quot;n&quot;2 + &quot;n&quot; + &quot;c&quot; is always coprime to &quot;S&quot;. The integer &quot;c&quot; may be negative, in which case there is a delay before primes are produced.

It is known, based on Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions, that linear polynomial functions formula_108 produce infinitely many primes as long as &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are relatively prime (though no such function will assume prime values for all values of &quot;n&quot;). Moreover, the Green–Tao theorem says that for any &quot;k&quot; there exists a pair of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, with the property that formula_109 is prime for any &quot;n&quot; from 0 through &quot;k&quot; − 1. However, the best known result of such type is for &quot;k&quot; = 27:

:formula_110

is prime for all &quot;n&quot; from 0 through 26. It is not even known whether there exists a univariate polynomial of degree at least 2, that assumes an infinite number of values that are prime; see Bunyakovsky conjecture.

=== Ziatdinov&#x27;s polynomials ===

In 2025, Ziatdinov discovered many other quadratic polynomials that, like the Euler prime-generating polynomial, produce 40 consecutive primes and found that there are better polynomials in terms of the percentage of primes in the given range.

==Possible formula using a recurrence relation==
Another prime generator is defined by the recurrence relation
:formula_111
where gcd(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) denotes the greatest common divisor of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. The sequence of differences &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 − &quot;an&quot; starts with 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 11, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 23, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 47, 3, 1, 5, 3, ... . proved that this sequence contains only ones and prime numbers. However, it does not contain all the prime numbers, since the terms gcd(&quot;n&quot; + 1, &quot;an&quot;) are always odd and so never equal to 2. 587 is the smallest prime (other than 2) not appearing in the first 10,000 outcomes that are different from 1. Nevertheless, in the same paper it was conjectured to contain all odd primes, even though it is rather inefficient.

Note that there is a trivial program that enumerates all and only the prime numbers, as well as more efficient ones, so such recurrence relations are more a matter of curiosity than of any practical use.

<doc id="509013" wikidata="Q1235448" url="?curid=509013" title="Endgame (play)">
<text>Endgame is an absurdist, tragicomic one-act play by Irish playwright Samuel Beckett. It is about a blind, paralyzed, domineering elderly man, his geriatric parents, and his servile companion in an abandoned house in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, who await an unspecified &quot;end&quot;. Much of the play&#x27;s content consists of terse, back and forth dialogue between the characters reminiscent of bantering, along with trivial stage actions. The plot is supplanted by the development of a grotesque story-within-a-story that the character Hamm is relating. The play&#x27;s title refers to chess and frames the characters as acting out a losing battle with each other or their fate.

Originally written in French (entitled &quot;Fin de partie&quot;), the play was translated into English by Beckett himself and first performed on 3 April 1957 at the Royal Court Theatre in London in a French-language production. Written before but premiering after &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; , it is usually considered among Beckett&#x27;s most notable works. The literary critic Harold Bloom called it the most original work of literature of the 20th century, saying that &quot;[Other dramatists of the time] have no Endgame; to find a drama of its reverberatory power, you have to return to Ibsen.&quot; Beckett considered it his masterpiece and saw it as the most aesthetically perfect, compact representation of his artistic views on human existence, and refers to it when speaking autobiographically through Krapp in &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; when he mentions he had &quot;already written the masterpiece&quot;..

==Characters==
* Hamm: Throughout the play remains seated in an armchair fitted with casters, unable to stand, and blind. Hamm is dominating, acrimonious, banterous and comfortable in his misery. He claims to suffer, but his pessimism seems self-elected. He chooses to be isolated and self-absorbed. His relationships come off as parched of human empathy; he refers to his father as a &quot;fornicator&quot;, refused to help his neighbor with oil for her lamp when she badly needed it, and has a fake pet dog which is a stuffed animal.
* Clov: Hamm&#x27;s servant who is unable to sit. Taken in by Hamm as a child. Clov is wistful. He longs for something else, but has nothing to pursue. More mundane than Hamm, he reflects on his opportunities but takes little charge. Clov is benevolent, but weary.
* Nagg: Hamm&#x27;s father who has no legs and lives in a dustbin. Nagg is gentle and fatherly, yet sorrowful and aggrieved in the face of his son&#x27;s ingratitude.
* Nell: Hamm&#x27;s mother who has no legs and lives in a dustbin next to Nagg. Reflective, she delivers a monologue about a beautiful day on Lake Como, and apparently dies during the course of the play.

Samuel Beckett said that in his choice of character&#x27;s names, he had in mind the word &quot;hammer&quot; and the word &quot;nail&quot; in English, French and German respectively, &quot;clou&quot; and &quot;nagel&quot;.

Beckett was an avid chess player, and the term endgame refers to the ending phase of a chess game. The play is dimly visible as a kind of metaphorical chess, albeit with limited symbolic meaning. Hamm at one point says &quot;My kingdom for a knight-man!&quot;. Hamm, limited in his movement, resembles the king piece on a chess board, and Clov, who moves for him, a knight.

==Synopsis==
In a dreary, dim and nondescript room, Clov draws the curtains from the windows and prepares his master Hamm for his day. He says, &quot;It&#x27;s nearly finished,&quot; though it is not clear what he is referring to. He awakes Hamm by pulling a sheet from over him. After Hamm removes a bloodstained handkerchief from over his head and face, he says &quot;It&#x27;s time it ended.&quot; He summons Clov by means of a whistle, and they banter briefly.

Eventually, Hamm&#x27;s parents, Nell and Nagg, appear from inside two trash cans at the back of the stage. Hamm is as equally threatening, condescending and acrimonious with his parents as with his servant, though they still share a degree of mutual humor; Nell eventually sinks back into her bin, and Clov, examining her, says, &quot;She has no pulse.&quot; Hamm tells his father he is telling a story and recites it partially to him, a fragment which treats on a derelict man who comes crawling on his belly to the narrator, who is putting up Christmas decorations, begging him for food for his starving boy sheltering in the wilderness.

Clov returns, and they continue to banter in a way that is both quick-witted and comical yet with dark, undertones. Clov often threatens to leave Hamm, but it is made clear that he has nowhere to go as the world outside seems to be destroyed. Much of the stage action is intentionally banal and monotonous, including sequences where Clov moves Hamm&#x27;s chair in various directions so that he feels himself to be in the right position, as well as moving him nearer to the window.

By the end of the play, Clov finally seems intent on pursuing his commitment of leaving his cruel master Hamm. Clov tells him there is no more of the painkiller left, which Hamm has been insisting on getting his dose of throughout the play. Hamm finishes his dark, chilling story by having the narrator berate the collapsed man for the futility of trying to feed his son for a few more days when evidently their luck has run out (it becomes plain that the character of the narrator is Hamm himself, relating the events which brought Clov [the man&#x27;s son] to him). Hamm believes Clov has left, being blind, but Clov re-enters and stands in the room silently with his coat on and carrying luggage, going nowhere. Hamm calls for his father, but receives no answer; he discards some of his belongings, and says that, though he has made his exit, his bloodstained handkerchief, which he replaces over his face and head, will &quot;remain&quot;.

==Themes==

Themes of &quot;Endgame&quot; include decay, insatiety and dissatisfaction, pain, monotony, absurdity, humor, horror, meaninglessness, nothingness, existentialism, nonsense, solipsism and people&#x27;s inability to relate to or find completion in one another. Other themes include narrative or story-telling, family relations, nature, destruction, abandonment, and sorrow.

==Key features, symbols and motifs==

Hamm&#x27;s story is broken up and told in segments throughout the play. It serves essentially as part of the climax of &quot;Endgame&quot;, albeit somewhat inconclusively.

Hamm&#x27;s story is gripping for how the narrative tone it is told in contrasts with the way the play the characters are in seems to be written or proceed. Whereas &quot;Endgame&quot; is somehow lurching, starting and stopping, rambling, unbearably impatient and sometimes incoherent, Hamm&#x27;s story in some ways has a much more clear, liquid, fluid, descriptive narrative lens to it. In fact, in the way it uses run-of-the-mill literary techniques like describing the setting, facial expressions or an exchange of dialogue, in slightly bizarre ways, it almost seems like a parody of writing itself. Beckett&#x27;s eerie stories about people at their last gasp often doing or seeking something futile is central to his art. It could be taken to represent the inanity of existence, but it also seems to hint at mocking not only life but storytelling itself, inverting and negating the literary craft with stories that are idiotically written and overwrought.

Characteristic Beckettian features in &quot;Endgame&quot; include bicycles, a seemingly imaginary son, pity, darkness, a shelter, and a story being told within the play.

The play has postmodernist and metafictional elements, including the fact that characters recurrently hint that they are aware they are characters in a play.

==Production history==
The play was premiered on 3 April 1957 at the Royal Court Theatre, London, performed in French. The production was directed by Roger Blin, who also played Hamm, with Jean Martin as Clov, Georges Adet as Nagg and Christine Tsingos as Nell.

Other early productions included a 1958 production at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York, directed by Alan Schneider with Lester Rawlins as Hamm, Alvin Epstein as Clov, Nydia Westman as Nell and P. J. Kelly as Nagg (a recording of the play, with Gerald Hiken replacing Epstein, was released by Evergreen Records in 1958); and at the Royal Court Theatre in London directed by George Devine who also played Hamm, with Jack MacGowran as Clov.

In the early 1960s, an English language production produced by Philippe Staib and directed by Beckett, with Patrick Magee and Jack MacGowran, was staged at the Studio des Champs-Elysees, Paris. After the Paris production, Beckett directed two other productions of the play: at the Schiller Theater Werkstatt, Berlin, 26 September 1967, with Ernst Schröder as Hamm and Horst Bollmann as Clov; and at the Riverside Studios, London, May 1980 with Rick Cluchey as Hamm and Bud Thorpe as Clov.

In 1984, JoAnne Akalaitis directed the play at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The production featured music from Philip Glass and was set in a derelict subway tunnel. Grove Press, the owner of Beckett&#x27;s work, took legal action against the theatre. The issue was settled out of court through the agreement of an insert into the program, part of which was written by Beckett:

Any production of &quot;Endgame&quot; which ignores my stage directions is completely unacceptable to me. My play requires an empty room and two small windows. The American Repertory Theater production which dismisses my directions is a complete parody of the play as conceived by me. Anybody who cares for the work couldn&#x27;t fail to be disgusted by this.

In 1985 Beckett directed &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; and &quot;Endgame&quot; as stage pieces with the San Quentin Players. All three productions were grouped together under the title &quot;Beckett Directs Beckett&quot;, and the production toured Europe and parts of Asia.

In 1991, a TV movie production was filmed with Stephen Rea as Clov, Norman Beaton as Hamm, Charlie Drake as Nagg and Kate Binchy as Nell.

In 1992, a videotaped production directed by Beckett, with Walter Asmus as the television director, was made as part of the &quot;Beckett Directs Beckett&quot; series, with Rick Cluchey as Hamm, Bud Thorpe as Clov, Alan Mandell as Nagg and Teresita Garcia-Suro as Nell.

A production with Michael Gambon as Hamm and David Thewlis as Clov and directed by Conor McPherson was filmed in 2000 as part of the &quot;Beckett on Film&quot; project.

In 2004, a production with Michael Gambon as Hamm and Lee Evans as Clov was staged at London&#x27;s Albery Theatre, directed by Matthew Warchus.

In 2005, Tony Roberts starred as Hamm in a production directed by Charlotte Moore at the Irish Repertory Theater in New York City with Alvin Epstein as Nagg, Adam Heller as Clov and Kathryn Grody as Nell.

In 2008 there was a brief revival staged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music starring John Turturro as Hamm, Max Casella as Clov, Alvin Epstein as Nagg and Elaine Stritch as Nell. New York theatre veteran Andrei Belgrader directed, replacing originally-sought Sam Mendes.

In 2009, the British theatre company Complicite staged the play in London&#x27;s West End with Mark Rylance as Hamm and Simon McBurney (who also directed the production) as Clov. The production also featured Tom Hickey as Nagg and Miriam Margolyes as Nell. The production opened on 2 October 2009 at the Duchess Theatre. Tim Hatley designed the set.

In 2010, Steppenwolf Theatre Company staged &quot;Endgame&quot;. It was directed by Frank Galati and starred Ian Barford as Clov, William Petersen as Hamm, Francis Guinan as Nagg, and Martha Lavey as Nell. James Schuette was responsible for set and scenic design.

In 2015, two of Australia&#x27;s major state theatre companies staged the play. For Sydney Theatre Company, Andrew Upton directed the production, featuring Hugo Weaving as Hamm, and for Melbourne Theatre Company, Colin Friels starred in a production directed by Sam Strong and designed by visual artist Callum Morton.

In 2016, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actors David Neilson and Chris Gascoyne starred in a staging of the play at both the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow and HOME in Manchester.

In 2019, the play was produced by Pan Pan Theatre at the Project Arts Centre in Dublin. The production was directed by Gavin Quinn and starred Andrew Bennett, Des Keogh, Rosaleen Linehan and Antony Morris. The production was designed by Aedin Cosgrove.

In 2020, the Old Vic in London staged a production directed by Richard Jones with Alan Cumming as Hamm, Daniel Radcliffe as Clov, Jane Horrocks as Nell and Karl Johnson as Nagg in a double bill with &quot;Rough for Theatre II&quot;. Unfortunately, the production had to end its run two weeks earlier than its planned closing date of 28 March 2020 due to concerns over an outbreak of COVID-19.

Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre staged the play in 2022. Directed by Danya Taymor, Hamm was played by Frankie Boyle and Clov by Robert Sheehan, with Seán McGinley and Gina Moxley as Nagg and Nell.

The French version was staged in 2022 at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Atelier in Paris. Jacques Osinski directed, Hamm was played by Frédéric Leidgens, Clov by Denis Lavant, Nagg and Nell by Peter Bonke and Claudine Delvaux.

A new production directed by Ciarán O&#x27;Reilly opened at the Irish Repertory Theater in New York City with previews beginning 25 January 2023 and an opening date of 2 February, with John Douglas Thompson as Hamm, Bill Irwin as Clov, Joe Grifasi as Nagg and Patrice Johnson Chevannes as Nell. The production was originally scheduled to run until 12 March, but was extended until 9 April.

==Adaptations==
The play was adapted into an opera by György Kurtág, premiered at the Teatro alla Scala in 2018.

<text>In mathematics, a heptagonal number is a figurate number that is constructed by combining heptagons with ascending size. The &quot;n&quot;-th heptagonal number is given by the formula 
:formula_1.

The first few heptagonal numbers are:
:0, 1, 7, 18, 34, 55, 81, 112, 148, 189, 235, 286, 342, 403, 469, 540, 616, 697, 783, 874, 970, 1071, 1177, 1288, 1404, 1525, 1651, 1782, … 

==Parity==
The parity of heptagonal numbers follows the pattern odd-odd-even-even. Like square numbers, the digital root in base 10 of a heptagonal number can only be 1, 4, 7 or 9. Five times a heptagonal number, plus 1 equals a triangular number.

==Additional properties==
* The heptagonal numbers have several notable formulas:
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
==Sum of reciprocals==
A formula for the sum of the reciprocals of the heptagonal numbers is given by:

:formula_6

with golden ratio formula_7.

== Heptagonal roots ==
In analogy to the square root of &quot;x, &quot;one can calculate the heptagonal root of &quot;x&quot;, meaning the number of terms in the sequence up to and including &quot;x&quot;.

The heptagonal root of &quot;x &quot; is given by the formula

:formula_8

which is obtained by using the quadratic formula to solve formula_9 for its unique positive root &quot;n&quot;.

<text>A mug is a type of cup, a drinking vessel usually intended for hot drinks such as: coffee, hot chocolate, or tea. Mugs usually have handles and hold a larger amount of fluid than other types of cups such as teacups or coffee cups. Typically, a mug holds approximately of liquid. A mug-shaped vessel much larger than this tends to be called a tankard. 

Mugs typically have a straight-line profile, either perpendicular or flaring. But this is not defining for the form, and a curving profile is possible. But a single vertical handle is essential (otherwise the vessel is a beaker), as is the lack of a matching saucer. A mug is a less formal style of drink container and is not usually used in formal place settings, where a teacup or coffee cup is preferred. Shaving mugs are used to assist in wet shaving.

Ancient mugs were usually carved in wood or made of pottery, while most modern ones are made of pottery materials such as bone china, earthenware, porcelain, or stoneware. Large mugs, typically made of metal or pottery and used for drinking beer, are likely to be called tankards. Some mugs are made from strengthened glass, such as Pyrex. Other materials, including enameled metal, plastic, or steel are preferred, when reduced weight or resistance to breakage is at a premium, such as for camping. A travel mug is insulated and has a cover with a small sipping opening to prevent spills. Techniques such as silk screen printing or decals are used to apply decorations such as logos or images and fan art, which are fired onto the mug to ensure permanence.

==History==
===Early mugs===
Though today mugs are associated with hot drinks, milk and soft drinks, many early mugs appear to have been mostly used for beer or other alcoholic drinks, and were often larger than modern mugs. Wooden mugs were produced probably from the earliest days of woodworking, but most of them have not survived or stayed intact.

The first pottery was shaped by hand and was later facilitated by the invention of the potter&#x27;s wheel (date unknown, between 6,500 and 3000 BCE). It was relatively easy to add a handle to a cup in the process thus producing a mug. For example, a rather advanced, decorated clay mug from 4000 to 5000 BCE was found in Greece.
The biggest disadvantage of those clay mugs was thick walls unfit for the mouth. The walls were thinned with development of metalworking techniques. Metal mugs were produced from bronze, silver, gold, and even lead, starting from roughly 2000 BCE, but were hard to use with hot drinks.

The invention of porcelain around 600 CE in China brought a new era of thin-walled mugs suitable both for cold and hot liquids, which are enjoyed today.

===Shaving mugs and scuttles===
A shaving scuttle and shaving mug were developed around the 19th century; the first patent for a shaving mug is dated 1867. As hot water was not common in many households, one way to provide hot lather was to use a scuttle or mug. A traditional scuttle resembles a teapot with a wide spout where hot water is poured in; this is where it differs from a shaving mug, which has no spout. Both shaving scuttles and mugs usually have a handle, but some have none. Shaving mugs often look like a standard mug, however, some also have a built in brush rest, so the brush does not sit in lather. Modern versions of the scuttle are in limited production, usually by independent potters working in small volumes.
At the top of the scuttle or mug is a soap holder. Traditionally, it was used with a hard block of shaving soap (rather than soft soap or cream) and therefore had drain holes at the bottom. Later scuttles and mugs do not include the holes, and thus can be used with creams and soft soaps. Some scuttles and mugs have concentric circles on the bottom, which retain some water thus helping to build lather.

In use, the shaving brush is dunked into the wide spout, allowing it to soak into the water and heat up. The soap is placed in the soap holder. When needed, one can take the brush and brush it against the soap, bringing up a layer of lather; excess water is drained back. This allows conservation of water and soap, whilst retaining enough heat to ensure a long shave.

===Tiki mugs===

Tiki mugs, drinking vessels usually made of ceramics, originated in mid-20th century tropical themed restaurants and tiki bars. The term &quot;Tiki mugs&quot; is a generic, blanket term for sculptural drink ware that depict imagery from Melanesia, Micronesia, or Polynesia, and more recently anything tropical or related to surfing. Often sold as souvenirs, tiki mugs are highly collectable. Modern manufacturers include Muntiki and Tiki Farm. Individual artists, such as Van Tiki, also produced limited one-of-a-kind hand sculpted mugs.

===Travel mugs===
Travel mugs (introduced in the 1980s) generally employ thermal insulation properties for transporting hot or cold liquids. Similar to a vacuum flask, a travel mug is usually well-insulated and completely enclosed to prevent spillage or leaking, but will generally have an opening in the cover through which the contents can be consumed during transportation without spillage. As the primary mechanism by which hot (not warm) beverages lose heat is evaporation, a lid serves a vital role in keeping the drink hot; even a thin plastic one which conducts heat quite quickly.

Mugs with inner and outer walls, but not vacuum treated, are generally called double wall mugs. Usually stainless steel will be used for the inner wall while outer wall can be stainless steel, plastic, or even embedded with other materials.
Mugs designed for use when driving are called &quot;auto mugs&quot; or &quot;commuter mugs.&quot; Travel mugs have a spill-proof lid with a sipping opening and in many cases, a narrower base, so that they will fit into the cup-holders that are built into many vehicles. Additional criteria for evaluating auto mugs include: they must be easy to open single-handedly (to prevent distractions while driving), include a fill line (to prevent over-filling, which contributes to leaking), preferably have no handles (no-handled mugs are easier to grab while driving), should not obstruct a driver&#x27;s view of the road when he or she is drinking, and - with regard to cup-holders be able to fit, stably, into a wide range of mug holders.

==Other types==
===Amusement mugs===
The &quot;whistle mug&quot; or &quot;hubblebubble&quot; is an amusement mug. It has a hollow handle which can be blown through the mug like a whistle. With an empty mug, only one note is emitted, whereas a filled mug produces melodious trills and warblings.
===Puzzle mugs===
A puzzle mug is a mug which has some trick preventing normal operation. One example is a mug with multiple holes in the rim, making it impossible to drink from it in the normal way. Although it is tempting to grasp the body of the mug covering the visible holes and drink the liquid in the usual manner, this would pour the liquid through hidden perforations near the mug&#x27;s top. The solution is to cover the holes in the rim with hands, but to drink not through the top, but through a &quot;secret&quot; hole in the hollow handle.

A puzzle mug called &quot;fuddling cups&quot; consists of three mugs connected through their walls and handles. The inner holes in the mugs walls are designed in such a way that the mugs must be emptied in a unique sequence, or they will drain.

The Pythagorean cup (see picture) contains a small siphon hidden in a rod placed in the mug center. The cup holds liquid if filled below the height of the rod, but once filled above that level, it drains all liquid through the siphon to a hole in its base.

===Heat changing mugs===

Heat changing, heat sensitive, or magic mugs make use of thermochromism to change appearance when a hot beverage is poured into them.

==General design and functions==
Much of the mug design aims at thermal insulation: the thick walls of a mug, as compared to the thinner walls of teacups, insulate the beverage to prevent it from cooling or warming quickly. The mug bottom is often not flat, but either concave or has an extra rim, to reduce the thermal contact with the surface on which a mug is placed. These features often leave a characteristic circular stain on the surface. Finally, the handle of a mug keeps the hand away from the hot sides of a mug. The small cross section of the handle reduces heat flow between the liquid and the hand. For the same reason of thermal insulation, mugs are usually made of materials with low thermal conductivity, such as earthenware, bone china, porcelain, or glass.

==Decoration==
As a ubiquitous desktop item, the mug is often used as an object of art or advertisement; some mugs are rather decorations than drinking vessels. Carving had been traditionally applied to mugs in the ancient times. Deforming a mug into an unusual shape is sometimes used. However, the most popular decoration technique nowadays is printing on mugs, which is usually performed as follows: Ceramic powder is mixed with dyes of chosen color and a plasticizer. Then it is printed on a gelatin-coated paper using a traditional screen-printing technique, which applies the mixture through a fine woven mesh, which is stretched on a frame and has a mask of desired shape. This technique produces a thin homogeneous coating; however, if smoothness is not required, the ceramic mixture is painted directly with a brush. Another, more complex alternative is to coat the paper with a photographic emulsion, photoprint the image and then cure the emulsion with ultraviolet light.

After drying, the printed paper, called a litho, can be stored indefinitely. When a litho is applied to the mug, it is first softened in warm water. This detaches the gelatin cover, with the printed image, from the paper; this cover is then transferred to the mug. The mug is then fired around , which softens the top surface of the glaze, thereby embedding the image into it.

==Storage==
A popular way to store mugs is on a &#x27;mug tree&#x27;, a wooden or metal pole mounted on a round base and fitted with pegs to hang mugs by their handles. There are also racks designed for hanging mugs so that they are ready to hand. Those are especially useful on ships in high waves. Mugs can often be a collectible item, making storage and display tools/strategies something important to think about for collectors. 
==In mathematics==

The mug serves as one of the most popular examples of homeomorphism in topology. Two objects are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. Thus in topology, a mug is equivalent (homeomorphic) to a doughnut (torus) as it can be reshaped into a doughnut by a continuous deformation, without cutting, breaking, punching holes or gluing. Another topological example is a mug with two handles, which is equivalent to a double torus – an object resembling number 8. A mug without a handle, i.e., a bowl or a beaker, is topologically equivalent to a saucer, which is quite evident when a raw clay bowl is flattened on a potter&#x27;s wheel.
== Mugs and cups ==

Many languages − including French, Italian, Polish, Russian, German − use two separate words for mugs and traditional cups. Anna Wierzbicka suggested that this situation is due to a slightly different functionality: the traditional cups are designed for drinking while sitting down at the table, while the mug is supposed to be used anywhere. This, in her opinion, explains all the specific features:
* The saucer of the cup helps to protect the table surface, but is an inconvenience away from the table.
* The tapered shape of the cup accommodates the saucer, the cylindrical design of the mug is due to the absence of the saucer.
* Larger handle of a mug allows carrying the mug around when putting it down is not an option.
* Thicker walls of a mug allow cupping it with a second hand for convenience and reduce the chance of the mug being broken during long periods of handling.
* Sitting at the table implies a more formal occasion, so cups are made to be more elegant, and sold in sets (like a tea set or a coffee service). Mugs are informal and usually sold individually.
* A mug holds more liquid than a cup. Since limiting the area of the exposed surface of the liquid helps keeping the temperature of hot drinks, this increase in volume is achieved through mug being taller, while tapered cups are lower for stability.

<text>The Oyster card is a payment method for public transport in London (and some boundary areas around it), England, United Kingdom. A standard Oyster card is a blue credit-card-sized stored-value contactless smart card. It is promoted by Transport for London (TfL) and can be used on as part of London&#x27;s integrated transport network on travel modes including London Buses, London Underground, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), London Overground, Tramlink, some river boat services, and most National Rail services within the London fare zones. Since its introduction in June 2003, more than 86 million cards have been used.

Oyster cards can hold period tickets, travel permits and, most commonly, credit for travel (&quot;Pay as you go&quot;), which must be added to the card before travel. Passengers touch it on an electronic reader when entering, and in some cases when leaving, the transport system in order to validate it, and where relevant, deduct funds from the stored credit. Cards may be &quot;topped-up&quot; by continuous payment authority, by online purchase, at credit card terminals or by cash, the last two methods at stations or convenience stores. The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the number of paper tickets. Cash payment has not been accepted on London buses since 2014.

The card was first issued to the public on 30 June 2003, with a limited range of features; further functions were rolled out over time. By June 2012, over 43 million Oyster cards had been issued and more than 80% of all journeys on public transport in London were made using the card.

From September 2007 to 2010, the Oyster card functionality was tried as an experiment on Barclaycard contactless bank cards. Since 2014, the use of Oyster cards has been supplemented by contactless credit and debit cards as part of TfL&#x27;s &quot;Future Ticketing Programme&quot;. TfL was one of the first public transport providers in the world to accept payment by contactless bank cards, after, in Europe, the tramways and bus of Nice on 21 May 2010 either with NFC bank card or smartphone, and the widespread adoption of contactless in London has been credited to this. TfL is now one of Europe&#x27;s largest contactless merchants, with around 1 in 10 contactless transactions in the UK taking place on the TfL network in 2016.

== Background ==

=== Precursor ===
Early electronic smartcard ticket technology was developed in the 1980s, and the first smartcard was tested by London Transport on bus route 212 from Chingford to Walthamstow in 1992. The trial showed that the technology was possible and that it would reduce boarding times. In February 1994, the &quot;Smartcard&quot; or &quot;Smart Photocard&quot; was launched and trialled in Harrow on 21 routes. Advertised as &quot;the new passport to Harrow’s buses&quot;, the trial was the largest of its kind in the world, costing £2 million and resulting in almost 18,000 photocards issued to the Harrow public. It lasted until December 1995 and was a success, proving that it reduces boarding times, is easy to use, and is able to record entry and exit stops and calculate the corresponding fare fee, i.e. .

However, the Upass smartcard of the South Korean capital Seoul was eventually the first in the world to roll out this sort of technology, at the end of 1995, eight years before London did as the &quot;Oyster card&quot;. In the UK, the first smartcard publicly rolled out was the BusCard in the city of Nottingham in 2000.

=== Operator ===
The Oyster card was set up under a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract between Transport for London (TfL) and TranSys, a consortium of suppliers that included EDS and Cubic Transportation Systems (responsible for day-to-day management) and Fujitsu and WS Atkins (shareholders with no active involvement). The £100 million contract was signed in 1998 for a term of 17 years until 2015 at a total cost of £1.1 billion.

In August 2008, TfL decided to exercise a break option in the contract to terminate it in 2010, five years early. This followed a number of technical failures. TfL stated that the contractual break was to reduce costs, not connected to the system failures. In November 2008 a new contract was announced between TfL and Cubic and EDS for two of the original consortium shareholders to run the system from 2010 until 2013.

=== Brand ===
The Oyster name was agreed on after a lengthy period of research managed by TranSys and agreed by TfL. Two other names were considered and &quot;Oyster&quot; was chosen as a fresh approach that was not directly linked to transport, ticketing or London. Other proposed names were &quot;Pulse&quot; and &quot;Gem&quot;. According to Andrew McCrum, now of Appella brand name consultants, who was brought in to find a name by Saatchi and Saatchi Design (contracted by TranSys), &quot;Oyster was conceived ... because of the metaphorical implications of security and value in the hard bivalve shell and the concealed pearl. Its associations with London through Thames estuary oyster beds and the major relevance of the popular idiom &quot;&quot; were also significant factors in its selection&quot;.

The intellectual property rights to the Oyster brand originally belonged to TranSys. Following the renegotiation of the operating contract in 2008, TfL sought to retain the right to use the Oyster brand after the termination of its partnership with Transys, eventually acquiring the rights to the brand in 2010 at a cost of £1 million.

=== Technology ===

The Oyster card has a claimed proximity range of about . The card operates as a RFID system and is compatible with ISO/IEC 14443 types A and B. Oyster readers can also read other types of cards including Cubic Transportation Systems&#x27; Go cards. From its inception until January 2010, Oyster cards were based on NXP/Philips&#x27; MIFARE Classic 1k chips provided by Giesecke &amp; Devrient, Gemalto and SchlumbergerSema. All new Oyster cards have used MIFARE DESFire EV1 chips since December 2009. From February 2010, MIFARE Classic-based Oyster cards were no longer issued. MIFARE DESFire cards are now widely used as transport smartcards.

MIFARE Classic chips, on which the original Oyster card was based, are hard-wired logic smartcards, meaning that they have limited computing power designed for a specific task. The MIFARE DESFire chips used on the new Oyster card are CPUs with much more sophisticated security features and more complex computation power. They are activated only when they are in an electromagnetic field compatible with ISO/IEC 14443 type A, provided by Oyster readers. The readers read information from the cards, calculate whether to allow travel, assess any fare payable and write back information to the card. Some basic information about the MIFARE Classic or MIFARE DESFire chip can be read by any ISO/IEC 14443 type A compatible reader, but Oyster-specific information cannot be read without access to the encryption used for the Oyster system. While it has been suggested that a good reader could read personal details from a distance, there has been no evidence of anyone being able to decrypt Oyster information. By design the cards do not carry any personal information. Aluminium shielding has been suggested to prevent any personal data from being read.

Oyster uses a distributed settlement framework. All transactions are settled between the card and reader alone. Readers transmit the transactions to the back office in batches but there is no need for this to be done in real time. The back office acts mainly as a record of transactions that have been completed between cards and readers. This provides a high degree of resilience.

In 2008, a fashion caught on for removing the RFID chip from Oyster cards and attaching it to wrist watches and bracelets. This allowed commuters to pass through the gates by &quot;swiping&quot; their hand without the need to take out a proper card. Although the RFID chips were charged in the normal way and no fare evasion was involved, TfL disapproved of the practice and threatened to fine anyone not carrying a full undamaged card, although it is not clear what the actual offence would be, were a case to be brought.

=== Architecture ===
The Oyster system is based on a closed, proprietary architecture from Cubic Transportation Systems. The card readers were developed entirely by Cubic, whereas development of the back office systems was started by Fujitsu and completed by Cubic. The system has the capability to interface with equipment or services provided by other suppliers. The Oyster website is not part of the closed system but interfaces with it. Similarly, Oyster readers are now embedded into ticket machines produced by Shere and Scheidt and Bachmann on the national rail network.

In early 2007, TfL and Deloitte worked to migrate the on-line payment systems to a more open architecture, using a number of open source components such as Linux, to resolve issues of lock-in costs, updates, incorporation of new security standards of PCI DSS, non-scalability, low and inconsistent quality of service, and slower response time to business changes.

== Features ==

=== Registration and protection ===

Oyster cards can be registered, providing protection in case of loss or theft. Registration can be done online after the card has been used for a journey. It can also be commenced at a London Underground station, an Oyster Ticket Stop (shop) or a Travel Information Centre; for this, the customer has to supply a security password and their postcode, which must then be cited when completing the registration online. Registration enables the customer to buy any product for the card and to have an after-sales service, and it protects against theft or loss.

=== Sales ===

Oyster cards can be purchased from a number of different outlets in the London area:
* Ticket machines at London Underground stations, which accept banknotes, coins, and credit and debit cards.
* London Overground &amp; Elizabeth Line ticket offices
* Online, using the TfL website
* Through the TfL app
* Selected National Rail stations, some of which are also served by London Underground
* Travel Information Centres
* About 4,000 Oyster Ticket Stop agents (usually newsagent&#x27;s shops)
* By telephone sales from TfL.

As well as the £7 fee for the card, a minimum purchase of £5 credit or a week Travelcard or Bus &amp; Tram Pass is necessary at point of issue.

Visitor Oyster cards can be obtained from Visit Britain outlets around the world, and from other transport operators, such as EasyJet and Gatwick Express, and online and from any ticket office. However, these limited-functionality cards cannot be registered. Any remaining credit on the card is refundable upon return of the card; the £5 price of the card is not refunded.

Oyster cards were initially free, but a refundable deposit of £3 was subsequently introduced,
increased to £5 for a refundable Oyster card in January 2011. Any deposit and unused credit are refundable by posting the card to TfL; however, refunds are paid only by pounds sterling cheque, bank transfer to a UK bank account, credit to another Oyster card, or a TfL web account voucher, and refunds of over £15 require the customer to provide proof of identity and address. Refunds of up to £10 in credit plus the deposit may alternatively be claimed at London Underground ticket machines, which will pay the refund in cash. Even though the £5 deposit is officially for the card itself, the ticket machine has no facility for relieving the customer of the card who departs the transaction still in possession of a (now useless) Oyster card. On cards issued since February 2020, the £5 deposit became a card fee and will be repaid as credit to the card on the first transaction made more than a year after issue. From September 2022, the card issue fee went up to £7 and this is no longer refundable.

Oyster cards can be registered via the TfL website, or with staff assistance at London Underground ticket machines. Unregistered cards can only be loaded with credit to use at adult pay as you go rates, and adult 7 day Travelcards.

Ticket vending machines on most National Rail stations will top-up Oyster cards and sell tickets that can be loaded on to Oyster. New Oyster cards are not available at most National Rail stations. At several main line termini, TfL runs Travel Information Centres, which do sell Oyster.

=== Reporting ===

Touch-screen ticket machines report the last eight journeys and last top-up amount. The balance is displayed on some Underground barriers at the end of journeys that have caused a debit from the balance, and can also be requested at newsagents and National Rail stations that provide a top-up facility.

Oyster Online service can also deliver regular Travel Statements via email.

A complete 8-week &#x27;touch&#x27; history can be requested from TfL: for registered and protected Oyster cards, TfL can provide the history for the previous 8 weeks, but no further back.
Oyster online also displays up to 8 weeks of journey history.

== Use ==
=== Touching in and out ===
Travellers touch the card on a distinctive yellow circular reader (a Tri-Reader, developed by Cubic Transportation Systems) on the automated barriers at London Underground stations to touch in and touch out at the start and end of a journey. Physical contact is not necessary, but the range of the reader is only a few millimetres. Tram stops have readers on the platforms, and buses also have readers on the driver/conductor&#x27;s ticket machine, and on these modes passengers must touch their card to the reader at the start of their journey only, with the exception of tram journeys to Wimbledon station, where trams arrive within the ticket-gates and as such a touch-out is necessary to leave the station. At stations without barriers, such as most Docklands Light Railway stations, passengers must touch their card on a reader at both the beginning and end of their journey if they wish to avoid being charged the maximum fare for an unresolved journey. Such a step is not needed if transferring between trains within a station when using the same card for the full journey, but if changing between Oyster and a separate National Rail ticket, the Oyster card must be touched in/out at the interchange station as appropriate.

=== Season tickets ===
Oyster cards can be used to store season tickets of both travelcards and bus passes (of one week or more), and a Pay-as-you-go balance.

An Oyster card can hold up to three season tickets at the same time. Season tickets are Bus &amp; Tram Passes or Travelcards lasting 7 days, 1 month, or any duration up to one year (annual).

Travelcards are valid on all Underground, Overground, DLR, bus, tram and national rail services within the zones purchased. See the main article for a fuller explanation of Travelcards. Tube, DLR and London Overground Travelcards may be used on buses in all zones. Trams may also be used if the travelcard includes Zones 3, 4, 5 or 6.

Although TfL asks all Oyster users to tap their card at entry/exit points of their journey, in practice Travelcard holders only need to &quot;touch in&quot; and &quot;touch out&quot; to operate ticket barriers or because they intend to travel outside the zones for which their Travelcard is valid. As long as the Travelcard holder stays within their permitted zones no fare will be deducted from the pay-as-you-go funds on the card. The Oyster system checks that the Travelcard is valid in the zones it is being used in.

==== Travel outside zones ====
If users travel outside the valid zones of their Travelcard (but within Oyster payment zones), any remaining fare due may be deducted from their pay-as-you-go funds (see below for how this is calculated). From 22 May 2011, &quot;Oyster Extension Permits&quot; (OEPs) were no longer required. Before that date, users who travelled outside the zones of their Travelcard, and whose journey involved the use of a National Rail service, were required to set an OEP on their Oyster card before travelling, to ensure that they paid for the extra-zonal journey.

==== Renewals ====

Oyster card Travelcards can be renewed at the normal sales points and ticket machines at London Underground or London Overground stations, Oyster Ticket Stop agents, or some National Rail stations. Travelcards can also be renewed online via the Oystercard website, or by telephone sales from TfL. Alternatively a user can choose to automatically add either £20 or £40 every time the balance on the card falls below £20, with payment charged to a registered credit or debit card. Online purchases can be collected at any Oyster touch point (including buses, but not including ticket machines) 30 minutes after purchase; the previous requirement to nominate a station at which to collect the top-up and wait until the next day has been removed. The touch will start (or, as applicable, end) a journey in the normal way, and may result in a charge to the card.

=== Pay-as-you-go ===
In addition to holding Travelcards and bus passes, Oyster cards can also be used as stored-value cards, holding electronic funds of money. Amounts are deducted from the card each time it is used, and the funds can be &quot;recharged&quot; when required. The maximum value that an Oyster card may hold is £90. This system is known as &quot;pay as you go&quot; (abbreviated PAYG), because instead of holding a season ticket, the user only pays at the point of use. The use of Oyster pay as you go (PAYG) payment has now been implemented across National Rail services in the London Travelcard area (Zones 1–9), some additional stations served by c2c, Elizabeth line (not West Drayton to Reading), Govia Thameslink Railway, Greater Anglia, and London Overground, Southeastern highspeed services within London, as well as Gatwick Express and Heathrow Express.

In May 2006 TfL and the Department for Transport agreed a £20 million funding package for train operators to install the equipment necessary to accept PAYG at all London stations. The package was not taken up by any train operating companies and in September 2006, the South West Trains franchise was renewed by the Department for Transport with the condition that smartcard ticketing must be in place by 2009. In November 2007 the metro routes operated by Silverlink were brought under the control of TfL and operated under the brand name London Overground, accepting Oyster PAYG.

A necessary precursor of the acceptance of Oyster PAYG was the introduction of zonal single fares on the National Rail network in London; this was implemented in January 2007. Also in January, the then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone announced that he required operators to sign up by 31 January 2007 in order to receive the funding package offer. c2c and Chiltern Railways accepted the deal and on 31 January 2007, a commitment was made by ATOC, in principle, that all other operators would eventually accept the PAYG product. According to ATOC, roll-out plans were subject to the installation of suitable ticket gates and back office equipment at all 330 stations. It was expected that by February 2009 TfL would announce plans for all suburban trains to accept the card. In May 2009 London TravelWatch indicated it had discovered that the works were unlikely to be completed until 2010. On 23 November 2009 the GLA announced that from 2 January 2010 the vast majority of rail services in Greater London would accept Oyster PAYG.

When Oyster cards were introduced, the PAYG system was initially named &quot;pre pay&quot;, and this name is still sometimes used by National Rail. TfL officially refers to the system as &quot;pay as you go&quot; in all publicity.

The validity of PAYG has a more complex history as it has only been gradually accepted by transport operators independent of TfL. Additionally, the use of PAYG differs across the various modes of transport in London, and passengers are sometimes required to follow different procedures to pay for their journey correctly.

It is possible to have a negative pay-as-you-go balance after completing a journey, but this will prevent the card from being used (even if it is loaded with a valid Travelcard) until the card is topped up.

==== Oyster route validators ====

In 2009, TfL introduced a new type of Oyster card validator, distinguished from the standard yellow validators by having a pink-coloured reader. They do not deduct funds, but are used at peripheral interchange points to confirm journey details. Oyster pay-as-you-go users travelling between two points without passing through certain zones, or without using certain rail services are eligible for a lower fare, and from 6 September 2009 can confirm their route by touching their Oyster cards on the pink validators when they change trains, allowing them to be charged the appropriate fare for the actual route taken. The most common use case for a pink validator is to specify a route which avoid zone 1, but there are also fares with pink readers define which avoid some other zones, or for avoiding National Rail services which charge a higher fare. The pink validators are located at 16 interchange stations.

* Gospel Oak
* Gunnersbury
* Highbury &amp; Islington
* Kensington Olympia
* Rayners Lane
* Stratford
* West Brompton
* Willesden Junction
* Blackhorse Road
* Wimbledon
* Richmond
* Whitechapel
* Canada Water
* Surrey Quays (introduced September 2013)
* Clapham Junction (introduced September 2013)
* Ealing Broadway (introduced June 2022)

An example journey is Watford Junction to Richmond, which costs £12.50 peak and £9.00 off-peak by default, which is assumed to be via Zone 1. If travelling on a route outside Zone 1 via , the fares are £4.80 and £2.20 respectively, which can be charged correctly if the Oyster card is validated at the pink validator when changing trains at Willesden Junction.

Another example journey where a pink reader reduces the fare for non-Zone 1 travel, is Willesden Junction to Wimbledon, where the default fare costs £3.40 peak and £2.90 off-peak, but a touch at West Brompton will reduce the fare to £2.10 peak and £1.90 off-peak, as it suggests that the journey is made wholly on TfL services instead of using a National Rail service between Clapham Junction and Wimbledon.

==== Underground and DLR ====

Oyster card pay-as-you-go users must &quot;touch in&quot; at the start of a journey by London Underground or DLR, and &quot;touch out&quot; again at the end. The Oyster card readers automatically calculate the correct fare based on the start and end points of the journey and deduct that fare from the Oyster card. Pay-as-you-go funds are also used to cover any additional fares due from season ticket holders who have travelled outside the valid zones of their season ticket (see Travelcards above).

Passengers enter or exit most London Underground stations through ticket barriers which are operated by scanning an Oyster card or inserting a valid ticket. Some tube stations (such as those at National Rail interchanges) and DLR stations have standalone validators with no barriers. In both instances, pay-as-you-go users are required to touch in and out.

==== London Overground ====

London Overground services are operated by Arriva on behalf of TfL and Oyster pay-as-you-go users use their cards in the same way as on Underground journeys, touching their card on a card reader at the entry and exit points of their journey to calculate the fare due.

==== Buses ====

Users must touch the Oyster card only once at the point of boarding: as London buses have a flat fare of £1.75 (which allows for unlimited bus and tram journeys started within 62 minutes from the point of touching in), there is no need to calculate an end point of the journey.

Cash payment has not been accepted on London buses since 6 July 2014, with TfL heavily promoting the use of a contactless card or Oyster card. All major cards which carry the &#x27;contactless symbol&#x27; are accepted, as is payment by mobile phone payment app.
As London buses do not accept cash payments, TfL introduced a &quot;one more journey&quot; incentive on Oyster cards allowing passengers to take a bus if their cards do not have enough credit to pay for a journey (but not a negative balance). This may lead to a negative balance until the card is topped up later. When using the &#x27;one more journey&#x27; feature, customers receive an emergency fare advice slip to acknowledge that the Oyster &#x27;One More Journey&#x27; feature has been used and to remind them that their card needs to be topped up before another journey can be made. It was estimated in 2014 that by eliminating cash from buses, TfL would save £103m by the year 2023, to be reinvested into the capital.

Some London bus routes cross outside the Greater London boundary before reaching their terminus. Pay-as-you-go users are permitted to travel the full length of these routes on buses operated as part of the London Bus network, even to destinations some distance outside Greater London.

==== Trams ====

London&#x27;s trams operate on the same fare structure as buses; the rules are similar, and users with pre-pay must touch the Oyster card only once at the point of boarding. Transfers between trams and buses are free within 62 minutes (publicly stated as &quot;one hour&quot;) of the first touch-in. Passengers should not touch out at the end of the journey, although in practice, no charge is usually made to cards should this happen as it would come under the free transfer. Users with Travelcards valid for the Tramlink zones need not touch in unless travelling to with a Travelcard not valid in zone 3.

A more complex arrangement exists at Wimbledon station; tram passengers starting their journey there must pass through ticket gates in order to reach the tram platform, and therefore need to touch their Oyster card to open the barriers. They must then touch their Oyster card once again on the card reader on the Tramlink platform to confirm their journey as a tram passenger. Tram passengers arriving in Wimbledon must not touch out on the card reader on the Tramlink platform, but must touch-out to exit via the station gates. If the card is touched on the platform, the touch-out at the gate would be seen as a touch-in and cause the maximum fare to be charged to the card.

==== River ====
Passengers boarding a Thames Clippers riverbus service must tap their Oyster card on the reader situated on the pier before boarding. Thames Clippers operates a pay-before-boarding policy.

==== London Cable Car ====

Oyster cards are accepted on the London Cable Car route between Greenwich Peninsula and Royal Docks. The cable car is outside of the London Travelcard validity. The single fare is the same as purchasing a ticket with cash or card, but the 10-journey discount ticket is not available.

==== National Rail ====
As with Underground and DLR journeys, Oyster PAYG users on National Rail must tap their card at the start and end of the journey to pay the correct fare. PAYG funds may also be used to cover any additional fares due from season ticket holders who have travelled outside the valid zones of their season ticket (see Travelcards above).

Many large National Rail stations in London have Oystercard-compatible barriers. At other smaller stations, users must touch the card on a standalone validator.

==== Out-of-station interchange====
At a number of Tube, DLR, London Overground and National Rail stations which lie in close proximity, or where interchange requires passengers to pass through ticket barriers, an &quot;out-of-station interchange&quot; (OSI) is permitted. In such cases, the card holder touches out at one station and then touches in again before starting the next leg of the journey. The PAYG fares are then combined and charged as a single journey.

Examples include transferring between the Jubilee line at Canary Wharf and the DLR where Oyster card holders must tap their card at the ticket barriers in the Tube station, and then touch in on the validator at the DLR station. Balham (National Rail) to/from Balham (Tube) is another OSI, as is Camden Town (Tube) to/from Camden Road (London Overground). Failure to touch in or out on the validators in these circumstances will incur a maximum fare. In some cases (e.g. at West Hampstead NR stations) the OSI replicates interchanges which have existed for several decades before the invention of the Oyster system but were generally used with season tickets rather than day tickets.

Out-of-station interchanges can be temporary or permanent. A temporary arrangement may exist between two stations at short notice (routinely during weekend work but also when an emergency closure occurs). The two journeys that result are only charged as a single journey.

==== Recharging ====
The pre-pay balance of an Oyster card can be topped up at ticket machines at railway stations (TfL and National Rail) where Oyster is accepted, as well as at Oyster Ticket Stops in convenience stores, and TfL Visitor Centres. A maximum of £90 can be held on the card. It is no longer possible to top up cards at any station ticket office.

PAYG funds and Travel card season tickets (but not Bus &amp; Tram Passes) can also be purchased online via the Oyster online website or by calling the Oyster helpline. The top up can be collected 30 mins later by touching in or out as part of a normal journey at any station or on any bus. There is no requirement to select a specific station nor to wait until the next day, which was the case in the past.

For further information on recharging and renewals, see the section on Renewals in this article.

==== Auto top-up ====

Customers can set up and manage Auto top-up online for their existing Oyster card. They register a debit or credit card, make a PAYG top-up purchase (minimum £10) and select either £10, £20 or £40 as the Auto top-up amount.
Alternatively, a new Oyster card with Auto top-up and a minimum of £10 pay as you go can be ordered via Oyster online.

There is a constraint in the design, that requires a journey to be made via a nominated station, before auto top-up can be enabled. There are a number of services such as Thames Clippers, for which this initiation transaction is not offered.

Once the balance on the card has fallen below the £20 threshold, £10, £20 or £40 is added to the balance automatically when the Oyster card is touched on an entry validator. A light on the Oyster reader flashes to indicate the Auto top-up has taken place and an email is sent to confirm the transaction. Payment is then taken from the registered debit or credit card. Should payment fail due to the bank declining to authorise the payment, the Oyster card will be hotlisted (blocked).

To ensure successful transactions, customers must record any changes to their billing address and update their debit or credit card details as necessary.

=== Oyster photocards ===
Oyster photocards, with an image of the authorised user on the card front, are issued to members of groups eligible for free or discounted travel. The cards are encoded to offer discounted fares and are available for students in full-time education (30% off season tickets), 16+ cards (half the adult-rate for single journeys on the Underground, London Overground, DLR and a limited number of National Rail services, discounted period Travelcards, free travel on buses and trams for students that live and attend full-time education in London) and for children under 16 years old (free travel on buses and trams and discounted single fares on the Underground, London Overground, DLR and most National Rail services). A &#x27;Bus &amp; Tram&#x27; Discount Card is specifically given to disadvantaged and &#x27;unwaged&#x27; groups, primarily those on &#x27;Job Seekers Allowance&#x27;, &#x27;Employment Support Allowance&#x27; and receivers of a variety of disabilities allowances, at half-fare rates for bus and tram services only; these cards simply charge the full rate on journeys not included in the discount scheme.

==== Student cards ====
Student Oyster photocards offering a 30% discount on period tickets, are available to full-time students over 18 at registered institutions within the area of the M25 motorway, an area slightly larger than Greater London, at a cost of £20. Until the 2009–10 academic year, they cost £5 but required replacing each year of multiple-year courses. There is no discount for Pay-as-you-go, although many students hold the National Rail 16–25 Railcard, which can be added to an Oyster card at an Underground station ticket office to obtain a 1/3 reduction on off-peak caps and a 1/3 discount on off-peak Oyster single fares on all rail services. (NB peak National Rail fares may be cheaper with discounted paper tickets). A small selection of universities outside London have also registered on the scheme.

A replacement for lost or stolen cards costs £10 and involves applying for a replacement card online or by calling the Oyster helpline. A new photograph is not required. The funds and remaining travelcard is transferable to a new student Oyster photocard.

Since 8 September 2006, students at some London universities have been able to apply for their 18+ Oyster photocard online by uploading a digital photograph and paying with a credit or debit card.

==== Zip cards ====
On 7 January 2008, Transport for London unveiled the Zip card, an Oyster photocard to be used by young people aged 18 years or under who qualify for free bus and tram travel within the capital, with effect from 1 June 2008. To qualify, one must live in a London borough (and still be in full-time education if they are 18). Children outside London (and indeed the UK) may also apply for a Visitor version of the Zip card (which offers free bus and tram travel for under-16s, and half-rate fares for 16–18-year-olds) online, which they must collect from one of TfL&#x27;s Travel Information Centres. From 1 September 2010 a fee of £10-15 (Dependent on age) has been charged for the card.

==== Freedom Passes and 60+ Oyster Cards ====
Freedom Passes are generally issued on what is in technical terms an Oyster card, though it does not bear that name. Freedom passes are free travel passes available to Greater London residents who are over a specified age (60 until March 2010, increasing in phases to 66 from March 2020) or with a disability specified in the Transport Act 2000; individual London boroughs have exceptional discretion to issue Freedom Passes to disabled people who do not meet the national statutory requirements (though they have to fund them). On weekdays, travel is free from 09:00 on the Tube, DLR, buses, Tramlink, and select National Rail services, and after 09:30 free travel is available on most National Rail journeys entirely within the London zones. On weekends and bank holidays, there are no time restrictions. Cards issued to people with a specified disability have no time restrictions. Holders cannot put any money or ticket products on a Freedom Pass; to travel outside these times, a separate Oyster card, ticket, or contactless payment card is required.

London residents who are over 60 but who do not qualify for a Freedom Pass can obtain a similar &quot;60+ Oyster Card&quot; for a single fee. The outer boundary of the area in which Freedom Passes and 60+ Oyster Cards can be used is mostly the same as the area within which ordinary Oyster Cards and contactless payment cards can be used, but does not extend to some Oyster-supported stations far from central London. Details may vary from time to time, and can be determined by comparing the current Pay-As-You-Go map and Freedom Pass map.

A Freedom Pass is also an English National Concessionary Bus Pass and provides travel on local buses throughout England. (Concessionary bus passes from other areas look the same as Freedom Passes, but are not additionally marked &quot;Freedom Pass&quot;.) The 60+ Oyster card, however, is not valid for concessionary travel outside Greater London. This is because the concessionary bus travel scheme supported by the Freedom Pass is centrally funded by government and covers all of England, but the Oyster 60+ (and the Freedom Pass&#x27;s validity on Tube, tram and rail networks) is funded by the Greater London Authority.

=== Oyster and credit card ===
A credit card variant of the Oyster card called OnePulse was launched by Barclaycard in September 2007, combining standard Oyster card functionality with Visa credit card facilities. It incorporated contactless payment technology, allowing most transactions up to £20 to be carried out without the need to enter a PIN (unlike the Chip and PIN system). The OnePulse card was withdrawn on 30 June 2014; existing cards were replaced by another credit card.

In 2005, Transport for London shortlisted two financial services suppliers, Barclaycard and American Express, to add e-money payment capability to the Oyster card. Barclaycard was selected in December 2006 to supply the card, but the project was then temporarily shelved.

== Validity ==
A number of different ticket types can be held on an Oyster card, and validity varies across the different transport modes within London.

* = Valid across the whole network.
* = Not valid.
* = Elizabeth line: Not valid between West Drayton and Reading.
* = National Rail: Only valid within the TfL fare zones, and selected stations outside London
* = River: PAYG only available on Thames Clipper; Travelcards only provide discount, not valid for travel.
*! = must include Zone 3, 4, 5 or 6
*‡ = PAYG is valid on Heathrow Express, Gatwick Express between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport and Southeastern High Speed services between London St Pancras and Stratford International, but special fares apply which don&#x27;t count into any caps nor allow transferring between other National Rail services in a single journey. It is not valid on Southeastern High Speed into Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International, nor on Gatwick Express into Haywards Heath and Brighton.

=== TfL services ===

Oyster is operated by Transport for London and has been valid on all London Underground, London Buses, DLR and London Tramlink services since its launch in 2003, and on all London Overground services since their start of operation. However, Oyster is not accepted on Elizabeth line west of West Drayton towards Reading, which is the only TfL service not accepting Oyster, due to the fares (set by GWR) being both outside TfL&#x27;s jurisdiction and Greater London.

=== National Rail ===
The introduction of Oyster pay as you go on the National Rail commuter rail network in London was phased in gradually over a period of about six years (see Roll-out history). Since January 2010, PAYG has been valid on all London suburban rail services which accept Travelcards. Additionally, PAYG may be used at a selected number of stations which lie just outside the zones. New maps were issued in January 2010 which illustrates where PAYG is now valid.

Certain limitations remain on National Rail, however.

Heathrow Express accepts Oyster pay as you go since 19 February 2019.

In November 2007, the metro routes operated by Silverlink were brought under the control of TfL and operated under the brand name London Overground. From the first day of operation, Oyster PAYG became valid on all Overground routes.

Since 2010, some stations both outside the London fare zones and outside the TfL network have started accepting Oyster Cards, starting with the c2c stations to , and has been expanded progressively to , , , , , , , , and . The final expansion of the Oyster area occurred in August 2019, since then, new stations have been added only to the contactless area, but not Oyster.

=== London River Services ===
Since 23 November 2009, Oyster PAYG has been valid on London River Services boats operated by Thames Clippers only. Oyster cards are accepted for all Thames Clippers scheduled services, the DoubleTree Docklands ferry, the &quot;Tate to Tate&quot; service and the O2 Express. Discounts on standard fares are offered to Oyster cardholders, except on the O2 Express. The daily price capping guarantee does not apply to journeys made on Thames Clippers.

=== London Cable Car ===
Oyster card holders (PAYG, Travelcard or Freedom Pass) receive discounts on the London Cable Car across the River Thames between Greenwich and the Royal Docks, which opened in June 2012. Like London River Services, the cable car is a privately funded concern and is not fully integrated into TfL&#x27;s ticketing system. To encourage use of the cable car as a commuter service, substantial discounts are offered with a &quot;frequent flyer&quot; ticket which allows 10 journeys within 12 months.

== Pricing ==
&quot;Pricing below is correct &quot;

The pricing system is fairly complex, and changes from time to time. The most up to date fares can be found on Transport for London&#x27;s FareFinder website.

=== Adult single fares ===
Cash is no longer accepted on London&#x27;s buses and trams and, in order to encourage passengers to use Oyster or contactless, cash fares for tubes and trains are generally much more expensive than PAYG fares. A contactless debit or credit card can be used in place of an Oyster card at the same fare.

The single Oyster fare for a bus or tram journey is £1.75, although the Hopper fare rules allow unlimited bus and tram journeys within one hour of first touching in for no additional cost. (To allow for disputes over clock settings, the system uses a time limit of 62 minutes.) Passengers need to touch in using the same card on all the bus and tram journeys made and any free fares are applied automatically.

Using PAYG, a single trip on the tube within zone 1 costs £2.80 peak / £2.70 off-peak (compared to £6.70 if paid by cash). Tube journeys within any other single zone cost £1.90 at peak times and £1.80 off peak (£6.70 for cash at any time). Journeys in multiple zones are progressively more expensive.

However, even for journeys passing through the same zones, the price may be different depending on the actual line(s) used. For example, a journey from Willesden Junction to Wimbledon has 5 different routes, 3 of them involving travel between zones 1-3 and 2 of them within zones 2-3 only, defined in the route database. If travel is made by changing at onto the District line by touching the pink reader there, the fare charged is only £2.10 peak / £1.90 off-peak, while if a touch is not made there, travel is assumed to be via onto the South Western Railway which is on a more expensive fare scale than the tube even though the trips are within the same zones. Similarly, travelling via zone 1 is more expensive if a change onto the South Western Railway is made at compared to using the tube all the way from via Earl&#x27;s Court.

Travel to Heathrow Airport via Elizabeth line is more expensive than going via the tube even though both the tube and the Elizabeth line stations are in zone 6.

For every possible journey, there is a default route, possibly with other routes distinguished by intermediate touches, in the fare database. Each route has an associated &quot;zones travelled&quot; label which are the zones assumed to be travelled through. When touching out at a reader, the system looks up the appropriate route from the database according to the touches, which is the default route if no intermediate touches are made or if they don&#x27;t match any of the alternative routes, to charge the correct fare, and to record the assumed zones travelled into the card for capping purpose.

The zoned fare system under which Oyster operates inevitably gives rise to some quirks in the fares charged. A 21 stop journey between Stratford and Clapham Junction on the overground is charged at £1.90 at peak times (£1.80 off peak) whereas a 1 stop journey between Whitechapel and Shoreditch High Street on the overground costs £2.80 peak or £2.70 off-peak. This occurs because Whitechapel to Shoreditch High Street uses zone 1 and zone 2, as Shoreditch High Street is in zone 1 only, whereas the entire Stratford to Clapham Junction line runs in zone 2 only. The cash fare is £6.70 in both cases and at all times. Similar anomalies are a feature of zoned fare systems worldwide.

=== Fare capping ===
A fare capping system was introduced on 27 February 2005, which means that an Oyster card will be charged no more than the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard for a day&#x27;s travel, if penalty fares are not incurred. The daily cap is £8.10 within zones 1-2 and £14.90 within zones 1–6, provided no maximum fares are incurred for failure to touch in or out, or for touching in or out at the same station. A lower cap of £5.25 applies if the day&#x27;s journeys are restricted to buses and trams only. Fare capping for the Oyster card was the first large-scale use of the technology.

There are 3 different caps in use: all-day cap (valid from 04:30 weekdays to 04:29 the next day on all rail, tram and bus services), off-peak cap (valid from 09:30 weekdays / 04:30 weekends to 04:29 the next day on all rail, tram and bus services) and bus &amp; tram cap (valid from 04:30 to 04:29 the next day on buses and trams only). For both the all-day cap and off-peak cap, the respective zones travelled are recorded onto the card.

The Oyster system supports up to 15 zones. Stations which are not officially in zones 1-9 are allocated to the unpublicised zones, denoted A-E in hexadecimal (or 10-14 in denary), such as .

Because of how the price capping works, it can sometimes result in overcharging compared to using multiple Oyster cards. For example, if one takes a journey from zone 6 all the way to zone 1, then takes multiple journeys within zones 1-2, the system will charge for the journeys until the zone 1-6 cap is reached even though it may be cheaper to charge a zone 1-2 cap combined with a single fare from zone 6 because zone 1-6 travel is already recorded on the card. Contactless users don&#x27;t suffer from this problem as fare calculation is done at the backend after the day of travel, where the cheapest combination of fares is charged. TfL is working on a similar system for Oyster as well such that overcharged fares may be refunded afterwards. The complex interaction between single fares and the various caps may also mean that, by deliberately taking an extra bus journey, the total fare for the day may be reduced.

Price capping does not apply to PAYG fares on Heathrow Express, Gatwick Express, London River Services boats and on Southeastern high speed train services.

=== Travelcards ===
Season Travelcards within zones 1-9, Watford Junction, Hertford East / Broxbourne, and Shenfield can be loaded onto an Oyster card. For journeys totally within the zones covered by the Travelcard, no additional fare is deducted. However, if the default route is assumed to go through zone 1, and the Travelcard doesn&#x27;t cover zone 1, the user must tell the system that zone 1 is avoided by touching a pink reader when changing trains using a route which doesn&#x27;t pass through zone 1, otherwise an additional zone 1 fare is deducted. Because of how the system work, an Oyster Travelcard covering Hertford East / Broxbourne can also be used at Watford Junction, and an Oyster Travelcard covering Shenfield can also be used at Watford Junction, Hertford East and Broxbourne, as internally Watford Junction is in zone 10, Hertford East and Broxbourne is in zone 11 and Shenfield is in zone 12. This extra availability doesn&#x27;t extend to paper Travelcards.

For journeys partially within the Travelcard coverage, an extension fare, corresponding to the extra zones used, is charged from the PAYG balance. If the PAYG balance is negative, the Oyster card can no longer be used for travel even within the zones covered until it is restored to zero or above by topping up.

=== Railcard discount ===
Holders of Disabled Persons, HM Forces, Senior, 16–25, 26-30 National Rail Railcards and Annual Gold Cards (as of 23 May 2010) receive a 34% reduction in the off-peak PAYG fares and price cap; Railcard discounts can be loaded on at London Underground ticket machines (with help from a member of staff).

=== Bus and tram discount ===
On 20 August 2007, a &#x27;Bus and Tram Discount photocard&#x27; was launched for London Oyster card users who received Income Support. It allows cardholders to pay £0.75 for a single bus journey (capped at £2.25 per day), and to buy half price period bus passes.

This was originally the result of a deal between Transport for London and Petróleos de Venezuela to provide fuel for London Buses at a 20% discount. In return Transport for London agreed to open an office in the Venezuelan capital Caracas to offer expertise on town planning, tourism, public protection and environmental issues. The deal with Venezuela was ended by Mayor Boris Johnson shortly after he took office, and the Bus and Tram Discount photocard scheme closed to new applications on 20 August 2008; Johnson said that &quot;TfL will honour the discount [on existing cards] until the six-month time periods on cards have run out&quot;.

The Bus and Tram Discount Scheme reopened on 2 January 2009, this time funded by London fare payers. The scheme has been extended to people receiving Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and to those receiving Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance for 13 weeks or more.

=== River Bus discounts ===
Boats operated by Thames Clippers offer a 10% discount on standard fares to Oyster PAYG users, except on their O2 Express service, and a 1/3 discount to passengers carrying Oyster cards which have been loaded with a valid period Travelcard.

=== Minimum and maximum fare ===
In order to prevent &quot;misuse&quot; by a stated 2% of passengers, from 19 November 2006 pay as you go users are automatically charged the &quot;maximum Oyster fare&quot; for a journey on that network when they touch in. Depending on the journey made, the difference between this maximum fare and the actual fare due is automatically refunded to the user&#x27;s Oyster card upon touching out. The maximum fare is automatically charged to a passenger who touches out without having first touched in. The maximum Oyster fare applies even if the daily price cap has been reached as this does not count towards the cap. Two maximum fares are charged (one for touching in, one for touching out) if a passenger touches in at a station, waits for over twenty minutes, and then touches out at the same station, because the system assumes that the passenger has been able to travel to another station in that time, taking no account of situations where there are severe delays.

Users must touch in and out even if the ticket barriers are open. At stations without ticket barriers where Oyster is accepted, an Oyster validator is provided for touching in and out.

The system allows starting a journey if the balance of the card is at least the minimum fare from the station, which may be 0 if the card reaches a cap or if the station is within the zones covered by a Travelcard. However the maximum fare is deducted upon entry which may bring the balance to negative at this point.

Maximum Oyster fares may be contested by telephone to the Oyster helpline on 0343 222 1234 or via email. This involves providing the Oyster card number and the relevant journey details; further journeys appearing on the card are helpful to validate the user&#x27;s claim.

If the claim is accepted then the maximum Oyster fare minus the cost of the journey will be refunded. This is credited to the card the next time it is used on a journey. The only way to collect a refund is as part of an actual journey, otherwise a further maximum fare is charged. This is because when the passenger touches the reader with their Oyster card, not only will the refund go on to the card, but a new journey will start.

Refunds become available to collect within 30 minutes. There is no longer a requirement to nominate a specific station from which to collect the refund.

Customers claiming a refund must do so within 8 weeks of the overcharge.

Oyster users who do not touch in before making a journey may be liable to pay a penalty fare (£80) and/or reported for prosecution if caught by a revenue protection inspector.

=== Refunds for delayed journeys ===
Commuters who were delayed 15 minutes or more on the Tube &amp; DLR, and 30 minutes or more on London Overground &amp; TfL Rail, are eligible to claim a refund for the cost of their journey. Commuters with Travelcards that do not pay for individual journeys will be refunded the Pay As You Go price of that single delayed journey. Customers wishing to claim these refunds must create an online TfL account, and then either manually claim online each time they are delayed, or use the free Train Reeclaim tool which automatically detects delayed TfL journeys and claims a refund on behalf of the commuter for each one.

* Weekly capping is introduced on adult pay as you go Oyster cards. (September 2021)

=== Roll-out on National Rail ===

The National Rail network is mostly outside the control of Transport for London, and passenger services are run by number of independent rail companies. Because of this, acceptance of Oyster PAYG on National Rail services was subject to the policy of each individual company and the roll-out of PAYG was much slower than on TfL services. For the first six years of Oyster, rollout on National Rail was gradual and uneven, with validity limited to specific lines and stations.

Several rail companies have accepted London Underground single fares because they duplicate London Underground routes, and they adopted the Oyster PAYG on those sections of the line which run alongside the Underground. When TfL took over the former Silverlink Metro railway lines, PAYG was rolled out on the first day of operation of London Overground. As a consequence, some rail operators whose services run parallel to London Overground lines were forced to accept PAYG, although only after some initial hesitation.

Examples of these services include London Midland trains from to and Southern trains to .
The process of persuading the various rail firms involved a long process of negotiation between the London Mayors and train operating companies. In 2005 Ken Livingstone (then Mayor of London) began a process of trying to persuade National Rail train operating companies to allow Oyster PAYG on all of their services within London, but a dispute about ticketing prevented this plan from going ahead. After further negotiations, Transport for London offered to fund the train operating companies with £20m to provide Oyster facilities in London stations; this resulted in an outline agreement to introduce PAYG acceptance across the entire London rail network.

TfL announced a National Rail rollout date of May 2009, but negotiation with the private rail firms continued to fail and the rollout was delayed to 2010. Oyster readers were installed at many National Rail stations across London, but they remained covered up and not in use. In November 2009 it was finally confirmed that PAYG would be valid on National Rail from January 2010. The rollout was accompanied by the introduction of a new system of &quot;Oyster Extension Permits&quot; to allow travelcard holders to travel outside their designated zones on National Rail. This system was introduced to address the revenue protection concerns of the rail companies, but it was criticised for its complexity, and was abolished on 22 May 2011.

Outside of the London fare zones, since 2010, stations have been added into the area of Oyster acceptance, utilising the unused fare zones in the card. The expansion continued until August 2019 when all available zones were fully utilised and new stations could not be placed into an existing zone, since then further expansions have been contactless-only which doesn&#x27;t have such limitation.

==== Detailed roll-out history ====
* 2004: Interavailable routes, excluding intermediate non-interavailable stops
* 11 November 2007: London Overground
* 2 January 2008: Intermediate stops on interavailable routes on c2c, Greater Anglia and Chiltern Railways
* 17 September 2008: GWR route within London 
* 22 November 2009: Balham to Victoria on Southern 
* 2 January 2010: all stations within zones 1-6, and c2c stations up to 
* October 2011: Greater Anglia stations beyond zone 6 to Hertford East and Shenfield
* January 2013: Brentwood, Shenfield, stations beyond zone 6 to Broxbourne on the West Anglia main line
* 6 September 2015: Dartford
* 11 January 2016: stations beyond Coulsdon South to Gatwick Airport
* 9 March 2016: Swanley
* 25 February 2019: Epsom
* 2 April 2019: Cuffley, Bayford, Hertford North
* August 2019: Radlett, Potters Bar

== Impact ==
After the introduction of the Oyster card, the number of customers paying cash fares on buses dropped dramatically. In addition, usage of station ticket offices has dropped, to the extent that in June 2007, TfL announced that a number of their ticket offices would close, with some others reducing their opening hours. TfL suggested that the staff would be &#x27;re-deployed&#x27; elsewhere on the network, including as train drivers.

In August 2010 the issue of the impact of the Oyster card on staffing returned. In response to The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) ballot for a strike over planned job cuts, TfL stated that the increase in people using Oyster electronic ticketing cards meant only one in 20 journeys now involved interaction with a ticket office. As a result, it aims to reduce staff in ticket offices and elsewhere while deploying more workers to help passengers in stations.

== Usage statistics ==
By June 2010 over 34 million cards have been issued of which around 7 million are in regular use. More than 80% of all tube journeys and more than 90% of all bus journeys use Oyster. Around 38% of all Tube journeys and 21% of all bus journeys are made using Oyster pay as you go. Use of single tickets has declined and stands at roughly 1.5% of all bus journeys and 3% of all Tube journeys.

Since the launch of contactless payment in 2012, over 500 million journeys have been made using contactless, using over 12 million contactless bank cards.

In , over 12 million Oyster cards and 35 million contactless cards were used, generating around £5bn in ticketing revenue.

== Future ==

=== Beyond London ===
Since January 2010, Oyster PAYG is valid at c2c stations , , and in Thurrock (Essex).

On 2 January 2013, Oyster PAYG was extended to (a terminus of the Elizabeth line) and by Abellio Greater Anglia.

With regard to London&#x27;s airports, TfL and BAA studied acceptance of Oyster Pay As You Go on BAA&#x27;s Heathrow Express service and the Southern-operated Gatwick Express service in 2006, but BAA decided not to go ahead. However, Oyster has been valid to on both the Gatwick Express and Southern Rail and Thameslink services since January 2016.

Oyster was extended to Hertford East when London Overground took over suburban services previously operated by Greater Anglia in May 2015.

Oyster was extended to Epsom, Hertford North, Potters Bar and Radlett in Summer 2019, which was the final expansion of the Oyster network.

There were proposals to extend the PAYG service to the Reading after the Elizabeth line was opened, utilising the final remaining fare zone F, but it didn&#x27;t happen and the line eventually became contactless-only.

=== Non-Oyster contactless payment ===

In 2014, Transport for London became the first public transport provider in the world to accept payment from contactless bank cards. TfL first started accepting contactless debit and credit cards on London Buses on 13 December 2012, expanding to the Underground, Tram and the Docklands Light Railway in September 2014. Since 2016, contactless payment can also take place using contactless-enabled mobile devices such as phones and smartwatches, using Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay.

The same requirement to touch in and out on underground services applies to contactless cards. The same price capping that applies to the use of Oyster cards applies to the use of contactless cards (provided the same card is used for the day&#x27;s journeys). The fare paid every day is settled with the bank and appears on the debit or credit card statement. Detailed usage data is written to Transport for London&#x27;s systems and is available for customers who register their contactless cards with Transport for London. Unlike an Oyster card, a contactless card does not store credit (beyond the holder&#x27;s credit limit) and there is no need or facility to add credit to the card.

====Advantages of Oyster====

While contactless payment cards can be used for most purposes, the Oyster card retains some advantages. An Oyster card can have a longer term &quot;season&quot; ticket, or a discount loaded onto it, which is not yet available on contactless bank cards (). Unlike an Oyster card, a contactless card has the advantage of automatically applying a seven-day Monday-to-Sunday travel-card rate: if the card is used several times in any Monday-to-Sunday period (but Monday-to-Sunday, unlike a 7-day ticket on an Oyster card), an automatic cap is applied. there is no automatic cap for other periods.

Since the Oyster readers cannot write to a contactless card, the reader when touching out is unable to display the fare charged for the journey, as the card does not have the starting point stored in it. This is calculated overnight once the touch in and touch out information is downloaded from the gates and collated. If the card is registered with TfL journey charges can be checked online from the following day. When a touch in with a contactless card is made, the validity of the card is checked by debiting the card account with 10 pence. The final fare charged excludes this initial charge.

As with Oyster, a failure to touch either in or out charges the maximum possible fare; this may also happen if different cards are used for tapping in and out, and if payment is made by a mobile device unavailable for tapping out, e.g. when the battery is discharged. Transport for London state that if ticket inspection is taking place, it is then necessary to present the contactless card to the ticket inspector&#x27;s portable oyster card reader. As the reader at the starting station cannot write to the contactless card and the card&#x27;s use is not downloaded until the following night, it is not possible to determine if the card was used to touch into the system. However after conciliation if it was found that the card was not touched in at the moment of revenue inspection, a maximum fare would be charged as a failed revenue inspection, and the card may be blocked from further use.

=== App ===
In late 2017, TfL introduced the free Oyster card app which allows users to check their balance on a compatible Android or iOS smartphone. Users can top up their Oyster card on the go, and check journey history. Top-ups are available to collect at any London Underground station or bus within 30 minutes. The app can notify users when their balance drops below a specified amount.

First-generation Oyster cards, identified by not having a &quot;D&quot; at the bottom left corner of the back (see images of the back of both generation cards above), can be used but are not compatible with the app, and TfL recommends that users get a new card, and transfer credit, season tickets, and refundable deposit from the old one.

== Visual design ==
=== Design ===
The design of the Oyster card has generally remained the same since its introduction in 2003, with dark blue and cyan separated by a white swoop. There have been three issues of the standard Oyster card, including the original red roundel issue, but all three Oyster cards have retained their original dimensions of 85 mm x 55 mm, with Oyster card number and reference number located in the top right-hand corner and bottom right hand corner of the back of the card respectively, along with the terms and conditions. The current Oyster card has Transport for London branding on the front of the card, with Mayor of London on the back of the card underneath the terms and conditions. 

Standard issues of the Oyster card have been updated since the first public release in order to meet TfL&#x27;s Design Standards. Trial versions, Transport for London staff versions and the first version of the standard Oyster card for the public were released with the roundels on the front of the cards in red. The second issue of the standard Oyster card had &#x27;Transport for London&#x27; branding on the back of the card, with the mayor of London (having replaced the &#x27;LONDON&#x27; branding in the blue segment of the card&#x27;s back). The roundel on the front of the card was changed from the colour red to white, as white was seen to represent Transport for London (whereas a red roundel is more known to represent London Buses).

=== Oyster card holder/wallet ===
With the release of the Oyster card, TfL released an accompanying Oyster card holder to replace the existing designs, previously sponsored by companies such as Yellow Pages, Direct Line and IKEA, as well as London Underground&#x27;s and London Buses&#x27; own releases of the holder which came without advertising.

The official Oyster branded holders have been redesigned on several occasions, keeping up with various iterations of the card and to increase service awareness. The initial version mimicked the blue design of the card itself, and was later modified to include the line &quot;Please reuse your card&quot; on the front.

In March 2007 the Oyster card wallet was designed by British designers including Katharine Hamnett, Frostfrench and Gharani Strok for Oxfam&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m In&quot; campaign to end world poverty. The designer wallets were available for a limited period of time from Oxfam&#x27;s street teams in London who handed them out to people who signed up to the &quot;I&#x27;m In&quot; movement. Also, to celebrate 100 years of the Piccadilly line, a series of limited edition Oyster card wallets were commissioned from selected artists from the &quot;Thin Cities&quot; Platform for Art project. The previous wallets handed out were sponsored by IKEA who also sponsor the tube map, and did not display the Oyster or the London Underground logos.

In late 2007 the standard issue wallets were redesigned with the only changes being the colour scheme changing from blue to black, and the removal of the resemblance to the Oyster card.

The most recent variation of the wallet came with the introduction of contactless payment acceptance on the network in 2012, where light-green &quot;Watch out for card clash&quot; wallets have been issued to raise awareness of &quot;card clash&quot;, and replace the previous simplistic designs. The inside of these wallets reads &quot;Only touch one card on the reader&quot; on the clear plastic.

In 2015 Mel Elliot won the London Design Awards with her &quot;Girls Night Out&quot; themed wallet.

In addition to the official wallets distributed by TfL, which may or may not carry advertising for a sponsor, Oyster card holders and wallets are sometimes used as a marketing tool by other organisations seeking to promote their identity or activities. Such items are normally given away free, either with products or handed out to the public.

Historically, customers were given a free wallet when purchasing a card, and wallets could be picked up for free at most stations or newsagents, though in September 2019 TfL announced that they were discontinuing their free Oyster Card wallets citing the cost and also the use of plastic.

=== Staff variants ===

Staff Oyster cards (also known as Staff Passes) are issued by Transport for London to active staff and one nominee of their choice. Staff nominees must be 16 or older, and reside at the same address as the staff member. They are also issued to retired TfL staff. They allow free travel on all TfL modes, and are not valid on National Rail services with some minor exceptions. TfL Engineers and Contractors are also issued their own respective Oyster cards, subject to different restrictions to regular staff variants however, and unlike full-time staff, cannot select nominees. Constables from the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police all have unique Oyster cards that allows them full access for law enforcement purposes. British Transport Police have separate Oyster cards for their constables and police staff/PCSOs, which are both also granted full access. 

=== Design variants ===
The standard Oyster card designs are as follows:
* Standard Oyster card, Blue: Design has remained mostly the same since its introduction in 2003, but very minor text changes on the reverse continue to occur. These are issued when limited edition cards are not in circulation
* One Day Bus and Tram Pass, Green: Introduced in January 2015, this card carries the &quot;Oyster&quot; branding and can only be used for a maximum of one day, as it can not be reloaded with credit. It is half the thickness of a standard Oyster card, as it is meant to be discarded when it expires. The card allows the user unlimited travel on bus and tram until the next day.
* Visitor Oyster Card: A visitor card is designed for use by tourists to London and can be delivered to their home address before they arrive. Tourists can benefit from special offers and discounts and save money in leading London restaurants, shops and entertainment venues on presentation of this card. A discount is also offered on the London Cable Car service.

A number of limited edition Oyster card variant designs exist. These are produced in limited quantities but otherwise function as standard Oyster cards. These include:
* 2011 Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. (750k produced) 
* 2012 Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Portrait Version. (250k issued) 
* 2012 Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Buckingham Palace Edition. (1.5m issued) 
* 2012 London 2012 Games - various designs listed below.
* 2012 150th Anniversary of London Underground. (1m produced) 
* 2014 TfL Year of the Bus. (1.4m produced) 
* 2018 Adidas x TfL (3 variations with 500 of each produced).
* 2022 Adidas Arsenal (1000 produced)
* 2022 Elizabeth Line
* 2023 Oyster 20th anniversary

In 2012, TfL released various cards to mark the Olympic Games taking place in London that year. The cards performed the same as any other card and also include all the same text, apart from a differentiating line (listed below), and the London 2012 logo. Cards like these were distributed solely to select 2012 volunteers who took part in the opening and closing ceremonies.
They were used for the duration of the games and therefore are no longer valid for use on the transport system. The colour of these Oyster cards is pink with a coloured stripe:
*&quot;London Olympic Games&quot;, Pink stripe.
*&quot;London Paralympic Games&quot;, Blue stripe.
* &quot;Olympic Volunteer&quot;, Green stripe.
* &quot;Paralympic Volunteer&quot;, Orange Stripe.
* &quot;2012 Ceremonies Volunteer&quot;, Purple stripe.

Three design variations of the Oyster visitor cards also exist:
* 2007 Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs exhibition at the O2.
* 2007 Standard version showing the London Eye, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, 30 St Mary Axe and the Millennium Bridge.
* 2012 Visitor Oyster card containing letters made up of landmarks spelling LONDON.

== Collaborations ==

In October 2018, TfL partnered with Adidas to celebrate 15 years of the Oyster card. A limited number of trainers from the &quot;Oyster Club pack&quot; went on sale on with each of the three types costing £80 and being based on an element of the Tube&#x27;s history. These designs include Temper Run, ZX 500RM and Continental 80. Only 500 limited-edition Oyster cards were produced, and each type of trainer contains a different card design in the box. Also included with the trainers is a genuine leather case (with TfL and Adidas logo engraving) and a credit of £80 preloaded on the Oyster card.

== Issues and criticisms ==

=== Touching out penalties ===
Card users sometimes forget to touch in or touch out, are unable to find the yellow readers or it may be too crowded to touch out. Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum fare, or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching in and out of the same station within a two-minute period, and charged the maximum possible fare from that station.

The system also applies two maximum fares (one for touching in, and one for touching out) to passengers who touch in and touch out at the same station after 30 minutes; this is due to the system assuming that, after such a long delay, the passenger has travelled to another station and returned without touching in or out at the other station, when in reality the passenger might simply have been waiting for a train, baulked at the long waiting time and exited.

=== Extension fares ===
Holders of Travelcards can add pay-as-you-go credit on their Oyster cards. This credit is used as &#x27;extension fare&#x27; when users travel beyond the zones in which their Travelcard is valid. This extension fare equals the regular Oyster fare for a journey from/to the respective station outside of the validity area of the Travelcard to/from the closest zone still covered by the Travelcard. To distinguish between peak and off-peak fares, however, the start of the journey is taken into account. That means travellers might be charged the (more expensive) peak fare as extension fare even if they had not yet left the area of validity of their Travelcard by the end of peak time. Conversely, a journey starting in the covered zones shortly before the start of the peak time will be charged as off-peak.

There is an exploitable feature of the system, in that if a touch-in (or touch-out) is made in a zone where the oyster card is loaded with a valid season ticket or Travelcard but there is no associated touch-out (or touch-in), the system does not change a fare. Although encouraged to do so, such ticket holders are not obliged to touch-in or touch-out within the zones of their ticket&#x27;s validity (other than to operate a barrier), and may in fact be impossible to do so when combining with a paper extension ticket for travelling outside the zones. This means that a passenger holding (say) a valid zone 1&amp;2 Travelcard, can touch-in at a zone 1 station (to open the ticket barrier) and then travel to a zone 3, 4, 5 or 6 station that does not have a barrier without touching out or paying the extension fare. Ticket inspectors frequently operate at such locations to catch these fare dodging passengers. Since the system maintains a record of every touch the card does make (even with a valid travelcard), TfL will assiduously seek to recover all the unpaid fares when a passenger who is caught is prosecuted for fare evasion.

From January 2010 to May 2011, passengers using an Oyster card with a Travelcard loaded seeking to start a journey in their paid-for zones and end it outside those zones were expected to use a ticket vending machine to set an Oyster Extension Permit (OEP) on their card before starting their journey. The effect of this setting was that a maximum journey charge was deducted from the card when touching in even within their zones, and this removed the incentive to &quot;forget&quot; to touch-out at the end of the journey. The OEP system was poorly understood by staff and passengers alike and was abolished after less than a year and a half.

=== Privacy ===
The system has been criticised as a threat to the privacy of its users. Each Oyster card is uniquely numbered, and registration is required for monthly or longer tickets, which are no longer available on paper. Limited usage data is stored on the card. Journey and transaction history is held centrally by Transport for London for up to eight weeks, after which the transactions and journey history are disassociated from the Oyster card and cannot be re-associated; full registration details are held centrally and not on individual Oyster cards; recent usage can be checked by anyone in possession of the card at some ticket machines.

The police have used Oyster card data as an investigative tool, and this use is increasing. On 13 April 2006, TfL stated that &quot;Between August 2004 and March 2006 TfL&#x27;s Information Access and Compliance Team received 436 requests from the police for Oyster card information. Of these, 409 requests were granted and the data were released to the police.&quot; However, in response to another request in February 2012, &quot;TfL said this had happened 5,295 times in 2008, 5,359 in 2009, 5,046 in 2010, and a record 6,258 in 2011&quot;.

Additionally, in 2008 news reports indicated that the security services were seeking access to all Oyster card data for the purposes of counter-terrorism. Such access is not provided to the security services.

As yet, there have been no reports of customer data being misused, outside the terms of the registration agreement. There have been no reports of Oyster data being lost.

=== Design ===
The system has been criticised for usability issues in general system, website and top-up machine design.

Oyster pay-as-you-go users, on London Underground, DLR and National Rail (including London Overground) services are required always to &quot;touch in&quot; and &quot;touch out&quot; to cause the correct fare to be charged. This requirement is less obviously enforced at stations where there are only standalone yellow reader rather than ticket barriers. Without a physical barrier, pay-as-you-go users may simply forget to &quot;touch in&quot; or fail to touch their card correctly, which will result in a maximum fare being charged. Equally, if the barriers do not function (reading &#x27;SEEK ASSISTANCE&#x27;) and the TfL or train operating company staff member has to open the gates manually, then the maximum fare may be charged. If this occurs a refund may be requested by telephoning the Oyster helpline the day after the incident occurs (to allow time for the central computers to be updated); the overcharged amount can be added back to the pay-as-you-go balance on the card from the following day when the Oyster card is used to make a journey.

The use of Oyster cards on buses has been subject to criticism following a number of successful criminal prosecutions by TfL of bus passengers whose Oyster card, when checked by Revenue Protection Inspectors, did not show that the passenger had &quot;touched in&quot; correctly on boarding. In particular, problems have been highlighted in connection with the quality of error messages given to passengers when touching in has failed for any reason. In one case, a passenger successfully appealed against his conviction for fare evasion when the court noted that the passenger believed he had paid for his journey because the Oyster reader did not give sufficient error warning.

In 2011, London Assembly member Caroline Pidgeon obtained figures from the mayor of London which revealed that in 2010, £60million had been taken by TfL in maximum Oyster fares. The statistics also detailed a &quot;top ten&quot; of stations where maximum fares were being collected, notably Waterloo and . In her criticism of the figures, Pidgeon claimed that &quot;structural problems&quot; with the Oyster system were to blame, such as faulty equipment failing to register cards and difficulty in obtaining refunds. A report by BBC London highlighted the system of &quot;autocomplete&quot; (in which Oyster cards journeys are automatically completed without the need to physically touch out, exceptionally used when large crowds are exiting stations) as particularly problematic.

=== Technical faults ===
In January 2004, on the day that the pay-as-you-go system went live on all Oyster cards, some season ticket passengers were prevented from making a second journey on their travelcard. Upon investigation each had a negative prepay balance. This was widely reported as a major bug in the system. However, the reason for the &quot;bug&quot; was that some season ticket holders were passing through zones not included on their tickets, and the holders had been correctly charged pay-as-you-go fares for the zones they hadn&#x27;t paid for. The existing paper system, and the previous Travelcard-only system, could not prevent this kind of misuse as the barriers only checked if a paper ticket was valid in the zone the barrier was in.

On 10 March 2005 an incorrect data table meant that the Oyster system was inoperable during the morning rush hour. Ticket barriers had to be left open and pay as you go fares could not be collected.

On 12 July 2008 an incorrect data table disabled an estimated 72,000 Oyster cards, including Travelcards, staff passes, Freedom Passes, child Oyster cards and other electronic tickets. The Oyster system was shut down and later restarted during traffic hours. Some customers already in the system were overcharged. Refunds were given to those affected and all disabled cards were replaced. Freedom Pass holders had to apply to their local authority for replacement passes (as these are not managed by TfL).

A further system failure occurred two weeks later on 25 July 2008, when pay as you go cards were not read properly.

On 2 January 2016 the Oyster system failed, with readers failing to process Oyster cards but continuing to process contactless cards and Apple Pay transactions.

=== The difference between pay as you go and Travelcards ===
Transport for London promoted the Oyster card at launch with many adverts seeking to portray it as an alternative to the paper Travelcard. In late 2005 the Advertising Standards Authority ordered the withdrawal of one such poster which claimed that Oyster pay as you go was &quot;more convenient&quot; than Travelcards with &quot;no need to plan in advance&quot;. The ASA ruled that the two products were not directly comparable, mainly because the pay as you go facility was not valid on most National Rail routes at the time.

Transport for London has made a significant surplus from excess fares deducted for those travelling using PAYG and failing to touch out as they exit stations. According to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act TfL made £32m from pay as you go cards of which £18m was maximum fares for failing to touch out. Only £803,000 was paid in refunds, showing that whilst customers can apply for a refund, most do not. The oyster online site does not list all maximum fares eligible for refunds on the front page, and users must search for fares charged on a particular day to discover all maximum fares that have been charged. The maximum fares for failing to touch out were introduced late 2006.

=== Validity on National Rail ===
Until the availability of Oyster pay-as-you-go on the whole of the National Rail suburban network in January 2010, the validity of PAYG was not consistent across different modes of transport within London, and this gave rise to confusion for Oyster pay-as-you-go users. Many passengers were caught out trying to use Pay as you go on rail routes where it was not valid.

On some National Rail routes where pay-as-you-go was valid, Oyster validators had not been installed at some intermediate stations. While Oyster pay-as-you-go users could legally travel along those lines to certain destinations, they were not permitted to board or alight at intermediate stations. If their journey began or ended at an intermediate station, they would be unable to touch out and consequently be liable for penalty fares or prosecution.

The complexity of Oyster validity on these routes was criticised for increasing the risk of passengers inadvertently failing to pay the correct fare. Criticism was also levelled at train operating companies for failing to provide adequate warnings to passengers about Oyster validity on their routes and for not installing Oyster readers at certain stations.

TfL published guides to the limitations of pay-as-you-go validity diagrammatic maps illustrating PAYG validity were published in November 2006 by National Rail, but these were rarely on display at stations and had to be obtained from transport websites.

Even after PAYG was rolled out to the whole of London, passengers are still frequently caught out at locations outside the PAYG area, having tapped into the system in London and travelled on a train out of London, such as at Stansted Airport. This trap equally applies to contactless payment passengers as well as Oyster users.

=== Online and telesales ===
Historically, Oyster card ticket renewals and pay-as-you-go top-ups made online allow users to make purchases without the need to go to a ticket office or vending machine. However, there were certain limitations to this system:
* tickets and pay-as-you-go funds can only be added to the Oyster card from 30 minutes after purchase (if bought online);
* users must select a station or tram stop where they must touch in or out as part of a normal journey to complete the purchase (as cards cannot be credited remotely);
* users must nominate the station in advance – failure to enter or exit via this station means that the ticket is not added to the card;
* tickets purchased in this way could not be added from a bus reader (due to these not being fixed in a permanent location).

Now only the 30-minute limitation and the requirement to make a journey still exist. Users no longer need to select a station and can collect the ticket or top-up made online at any station, including on a bus, while making the next journey.

=== Security issues ===
In June 2008, researchers at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who had previously succeeded in hacking the OV-chipkaart (the Dutch public transport chip card), hacked an Oyster card, which is also based on the MIFARE Classic chip. They scanned a card reader to obtain its cryptographic key, then used a wireless antenna attached to a laptop computer to brush up against passengers on the London Underground and extract the information from their cards. With that information they were able to clone a card, add credit to it, and use it to travel on the Underground for at least a day. The MIFARE chip manufacturers NXP Semiconductor sought a court injunction to prevent the publication of the details of this security breach, but this was overturned on appeal.

The Mifare Classic—which is also used as a security pass for controlling entry into buildings—has been criticised as having very poor security, and NXP criticised for trying to ensure security by obscurity rather than strong encryption. Breaching security on Oyster cards should not allow unauthorised use for more than a day, as TfL promises to turn off any cloned cards within 24 hours, but a cloned Mifare Classic can allow entry into buildings that use this system for security.

== Strategic research ==
Transport for London, in partnership with academic institutions such as MIT, has begun to use the data captured by the Oyster smartcard system for strategic research purposes, with the general goal of using Oyster data to gain cheap and accurate insights into the behaviour and experience of passengers. Specific projects include estimation of Origin-Destination Matrices for the London Underground, analysis of bus-to-bus and bus-to-tube interchange behaviour, modelling and analysis of TfL-wide fare policy changes, and measurement of service quality on the London Overground.

<doc id="509025" wikidata="Q2336063" url="?curid=509025" title="Soda bread">
<text>Soda bread is a variety of quick bread made in many cuisines in which sodium bicarbonate (otherwise known as &quot;baking soda&quot;, or in Ireland, &quot;bread soda&quot;) is used as a leavening agent instead of yeast. The basic ingredients of soda bread are flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk. The buttermilk contains lactic acid, which reacts with the baking soda to form bubbles of carbon dioxide. Other ingredients can be added, such as butter, egg, raisins, or nuts. Quick breads can be prepared quickly and reliably, without requiring the time and labor needed for kneaded yeast breads.

==Preparation==
Soda bread is made with coarse flour, white, whole meal, or a mix. High protein flour is not used because the preferred texture is &quot;moist and crumbly&quot;. Other grains (such as rolled oats) may be added. Soda bread is generally not kneaded because kneading can toughen it.

Buttermilk or sour milk is the usual liquid acid ingredient.

Variants may add olive oil, eggs, molasses, sugar, treacle, or honey.

==Origin==

===Ireland===
Traditional Irish bread was historically cooked on a griddle as flatbread because the domestic flours did not have the properties needed to rise effectively when combined with yeast. Baking soda offered an alternative, but its popularity declined for a time when imported high-gluten flours became available. Brown soda bread (served with smoked salmon) reappeared on luxury hotel menus in the 1960s. Modern varieties can be found at Irish cafes and bakeries, some made with Guinness, treacle, walnuts, and herbs, but the sweetened version with caraway and raisins is rarely seen anymore. Soda bread made with raisins is colloquially called &quot;Spotted Dog&quot; or &quot;Spotted Dick&quot;.

In Ireland, the flour is typically made from soft wheat, so soda bread is best made with a cake or pastry flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of gluten than a bread flour. In some recipes, the buttermilk is replaced by live yogurt or even stout. Because the leavening action starts immediately (compared to the time taken for yeast bread to rise), bakers recommend the minimum amount of mixing of the ingredients before baking; the dough should not be kneaded.

Various forms of soda bread are popular throughout Ireland. Soda breads are made using wholemeal, white flour, or both. In Ulster, the wholemeal variety is usually known as &quot;wheaten bread&quot; and is normally sweetened, while the term &quot;soda bread&quot; is restricted to the white savoury form. In the southern provinces of Ireland, the wholemeal variety is usually known as &quot;brown bread&quot; and is almost identical to the Ulster wheaten. In some parts of Fermanagh, the white flour form of the bread is described as &quot;fadge&quot;.

The &quot;griddle cakes&quot;, &quot;griddle bread&quot; (or &quot;soda farls&quot; in Ulster) take a more rounded shape and have a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand. The griddle cake or farl is a more flattened type of bread. It is cooked on a griddle, allowing it to take a more flat shape, and it is split into four sections. The soda farl is one of the distinguishing elements of the Ulster fry, where it is served alongside potato bread, also in farl form.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, varieties of soda breads and griddle sodas include bannocks and farls (Scots: , &quot;a fourth&quot;), &quot;soda scones&quot;, or &quot;soda farls&quot;, using baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent giving the food a light and airy texture.

Bannocks are flat cakes of barley or oatmeal dough formed into a round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle (Scots: &quot;&quot;). The most authentic versions are unleavened, but from the early 19th century bannocks have been made using baking powder, or a combination of baking soda and buttermilk or clabbered milk. Before the 19th century, bannocks were cooked on a bannock stone (Scots: ), a large, flat, rounded piece of sandstone, placed directly onto a fire, then used as a cooking surface. Several varieties of bannock include Selkirk bannocks, beremeal bannocks, Michaelmas bannock, Yetholm bannock, and Yule bannock.

The traditional soda farl is used in the full Scottish breakfast along with the potato scone (Scots: ).

===Serbia===

In Serbian tradition, soda bread is prepared by various rules and rituals. A coin is often put into the dough during the kneading; other small objects may also be inserted. At the beginning of Christmas dinner, the &quot;česnica&quot; is rotated three times counter-clockwise, before being broken among the family members. The person who finds the coin in their piece of the bread will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. Before baking, the upper surface of the loaf may be inscribed with various symbols, such as a Christogram, or stars, circles, and impressions of keys or combs.

===United States of America===
During the early years of European settlement of the Americas, settlers used soda or pearl ash, more commonly known as potash (pot ash) or potassium carbonate, as a leavening agent (the forerunner to baking soda) in quick breads. By 1824, &quot;The Virginia Housewife&quot; by Mary Randolph was published containing a recipe for Soda Cake.

In 1846, two American bakers, John Dwight and Austin Church, established the first factory in the United States to produce baking soda from sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide.

Modern American versions of Irish soda bread often include raisins or currants, and caraway seeds.

<doc id="509031" wikidata="Q287852" url="?curid=509031" title="Valdivian temperate forests">
<text>The Valdivian temperate forests (NT0404) is an ecoregion on the west coast of southern South America, in Chile and Argentina. It is part of the Neotropical realm. The forests are named after the city of Valdivia. The Valdivian temperate rainforests are characterized by their dense understories of bamboos, ferns, and for being mostly dominated by evergreen angiosperm trees with some deciduous specimens, though conifer trees are also common.

==Setting==
Temperate rain forests comprise a relatively narrow Chilean coastal strip, between the Pacific Ocean to the west and the southern Andes Mountains to the east, from roughly 37° to 48° south latitude. North of 42°, the Chilean Coast Range stretches on, with just the north–south running Chilean Central Valley between it and the Andes. South of 42°, the coast range continues as a chain of offshore islands (including Chiloé Island and the Chonos Archipelago), while the &quot;Central Valley&quot; is submerged and continues as the Gulf of Corcovado. Much of the ecoregion was once covered by the Patagonian Ice Sheet and other glaciers during the peak of the last ice age, with ice descending from the Andes mountains; numerous bodies of water within the Chilean Lake District (in the central part of the ecoregion) are the remnants of ancient glacial valleys. The southern part of the region features many glacier-carved fjords.

To the north, the Valdivian forests give way to the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub of the Chilean Matorral ecoregion. A few coastal enclaves of Valdivian forest grow in north-central Chile (such as Bosque de Fray Jorge National Park) as remains of the last glacial maximum. To the south lies the Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregion. The temperate Valdivian, matorral, and Magellanic ecoregions are isolated from the subtropical/tropical forests that dominate northern South America by such landscapes as the Atacama desert (north of the matorral), the Andes Mountains, and the dry, rain-shadow Patagonian steppe east of the Andes. As a result, the temperate forest regions have evolved in relative isolation, with a high degree of endemic species.

Due to a similar location geographically and geologically (along the Pacific Plate), the coast-hugging temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest (from Northern California to Southern Alaska, roughly 40°-60° north latitude) exist in similar settings, with the Rocky Mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. East of the Rocky Mountains, the North American prairie grassland stretches from south-central Canada to Texas, not unlike the Argentine grasslands to the east of the Andes. Similar to the Atacama region of Chile, the Baja California and Sonoran deserts in the US/Mexican states of California and Baja California act as climatic borders for the northwest’s rainforests.

===Climate===
Since the forest is located at around 40 degrees south, it is strongly influenced by the westerlies. The water vapour held by the westerlies condenses as they encounter the windward slope of the Chilean Coast Range and the Andes, creating orographic rainfall. Average annual precipitation varies from 1,000 mm at the northern edge of the ecoregion to more than 6,000 mm per year in the south. The northern portion of the ecoregion has a Submediterranean climate, with rainfall concentrated in the winter months. This seasonality decreases towards the south.

Average annual temperatures are fairly uniform within the area, especially at coastal locations where annual temperature differences between localities never exceed 7 °C. The northward-flowing oceanic Humboldt Current creates humid and foggy conditions near the coast. In the summer the temperature can climb to 16.5 °C (62 °F), while during winter the temperature can drop below 7 °C (45 °F). Winter temperatures are lower at higher elevations. The tree line is at about 2,400 m in the northern part of the ecoregion (35° S), and descends to 1,000 m in the south of the Valdivian region.

==Flora==

The Valdivian temperate rain forests are temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. The Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests are the only temperate rain forests in South America and one of a small number of temperate rain forests in the world. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the Pacific temperate rain forests of North America (which stretches from Alaska to northern California). The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the Antarctic flora, and share many plant families with the temperate rainforests of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia. Fully half the species of woody plants are endemic to this ecoregion.

&quot;Chusquea quila&quot; is a bamboo that grows in humid areas below 500 m, where &quot;Chusquea culeou&quot; becomes more dominant above. &quot;Chusquea quila&quot; can form pure stands called &quot;quilantales&quot;. Very few plants can grow under this species. Other notable species are the &quot;nalca&quot; or Chilean rhubarb (&quot;Gunnera tinctoria&quot;) and the ferns &quot;Lophosoria quadripinnata&quot; and &quot;Parablechnum cordatum&quot;. Chile&#x27;s national flower, the &quot;copihue&quot; (&quot;Lapageria rosea&quot;) is a pioneer species that grows in disturbed areas of the Valdivian rain forest.

The maximum plant species richness is found at latitudes 40 to 43° S.

===Forest ecosystems===

There are four main types of forest ecosystems in the Valdivian ecoregion. 

Deciduous forests. At the northern end of the ecoregion are deciduous forests, dominated by deciduous species of southern beech, including &quot;rauli&quot; (&quot;Nothofagus alpina&quot;) and &quot;roble&quot; (&quot;N. obliqua&quot;). This is a transitional zone to the Mediterranean-climate region to the north. It grows from 35 to 36º S latitude along Chilean Coast Range, where it is known as Maulino forest. &quot;Nothofagus glauca&quot; and &quot;N. Alessandrii&quot; are predominant trees in Maulino forest. Deciduous &quot;Nothofagus&quot; forests also grow along the Andes of central Chile as far north as 33º S latitude, from approximately 1,200 meters elevation up to the tree line at 2,400 meters elevation. A krummholz of &quot;Nothofagus antarctica&quot; and &quot;N. pumilio&quot; grows near the tree line. The southern limit of these forests is 38º S latitude. Tall coniferous pehuén monkey-puzzle trees (&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;) grow at the southern edge of the deciduous forests, from the coast at Nahuelbuta National Park to the Andes.

Valdivian laurel-leaved forests. Valdivian laurel-leaved forests, characterized by a variety of broadleaf evergreen trees, including &quot;Laureliopsis philippiana&quot;, &quot;Aextoxicon punctatum&quot;, &quot;Eucryphia cordifolia&quot;, &quot;Caldcluvia paniculata&quot;, and &quot;Weinmannia trichosperma&quot;, with an understory of &quot;Myrceugenia planipes&quot;, the &quot;arrayán&quot; (&quot;Luma apiculata&quot;) and other plants. Old-growth Valdivian evergreen forest (siempreverde) tend to form stratified canopy made up of two or three layers.

Patagonian Andean forests. The third forest type is the Patagonian Andean forests, which are distributed at higher elevations along the Andes mountain front, and are dominated by evergreen conifers, including &quot;pehuén&quot; (&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;) and &quot;alerce&quot; (&quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot;). The &quot;alerce&quot; looks like a giant sequoia, and is a rival in longevity to the bristlecone pine, some with growth rings recording 3,625 years of local weather cycles. Closer to the treeline, the conifers give way to Andean scrublands of deciduous &quot;Nothofagus antarctica&quot;.

Northern Patagonian forests. The fourth and last type is the Northern Patagonian forests, which dominate the southern half of the ecoregion, with evergreen species such as the broadleaf &quot;Nothofagus dombeyi&quot;, &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot; and &quot;Drimys winteri&quot; and the coniferous podocarps, including &quot;Podocarpus nubigenus&quot;.

Distribution of plants follow Rapoport&#x27;s rule with plant species distribution increasing at higher latitudes and decreasing at those closer to the equator, incidents of endemism becoming more frequent as one moves equatorward.

Lowland soils near the coast contain more available nutrients than more inland soils.

===Origin and evolution===
The flora of the forests has inherited and developed its characteristics due to a variety of causes. Its Neotropical affinities reflect its current geographic connection to the remaining South America. Its &quot;Gondwanan&quot; species are a legacy of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, a landmass formerly composed of South America, Africa, India, Antarctica and Australia. The high degree of endemic species and monospecific genera is thought to be linked to the geographic isolation came into being as result of the uplift of the Andes. There are a few &quot;boreal&quot; components in the Valdivian temperate rain forest which arrived by long-distance transport. Yet another component are the species from nearby South American ecosystems that adapted to the temperate rainforest. 

During the Llanquihue glaciation much of the area west of Llanquihue Lake remained ice-free during the Last Glacial Maximum and had sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by &quot;Nothofagus&quot; species. Valdivian temperate rain forest proper was reduced to scattered remnants in to the west of the Andes. More specifically the refugia of the Valdivian temperate rain forest between latitudes 41 and 37° S were; the coastal region, the lower slopes of the Chilean Coast Range and the westernmost Chilean Central Valley all of which remained free of disturbance by the glacial, glacifluvial and periglacial disturbance through the glaciation.

==Fauna==

Some of the threatened mammals of the Valdivian forests include the &quot;monito del monte&quot; &quot;(Dromiciops gliroides)&quot;, an arboreal marsupial, the southern &quot;pudú&quot; &quot;(Pudu puda)&quot; the world&#x27;s smallest deer, and the kodkod &quot;(Leopardus guigna)&quot;, South America&#x27;s smallest cat. Since the beginning of the 20th century, there have also been nonnative wild boars living in the Valdivian forests. The Chilean climbing mouse (&quot;Irenomys tarsalis&quot;) and Chilean shrew opossum (&quot;Rhyncholestes raphanurus&quot;) are endemic to the ecoregion. 

Most mammal genera in Valdivian forests are also found in semi-arid parts of Patagonia. Relative to similar forest in North America there is a low diversity of mammals in Chilean temperate forests.

The slender-billed parakeet (&quot;Enicognathus leptorhynchus&quot;) is endemic. Near-endemic and limited-range birds include the Chilean pigeon (&quot;Patagioenas araucana&quot;), Black-throated huet-huet (&quot;Pteroptochos tarnii&quot;), Chucao tapaculo (&quot;Scelorchilus rubecula&quot;), and Ochre-flanked tapaculo (&quot;Eugralla paradoxa&quot;). Hummingbirds are common in the Valdivian forests because of the presence of plants like the &quot;maqui&quot; (&quot;Aristotelia chilensis&quot;) and the &quot;copihue&quot;.

==Conservation==
The Valdivian forests include stands of huge trees, especially &quot;Nothofagus&quot; and &quot;Fitzroya&quot;, which can live to a great age. These magnificent rainforests are endangered by extensive logging and their replacement by fast-growing pines and eucalyptus, which are more sought-after by the pulp and paper industry. The native trees that are cleared to make way for these monocultures are often exported as woodchips to Japan. A start at conservation was made in November 2003 when a consortium of conservation groups, both local and international, bought at auction of a bankrupt logging firm 147,500 acres (600 km2) of biologically rich rainforest in the Valdivian Coastal Range. Gianni Lopez, Executive Director of CONAMA, Chile&#x27;s national environmental agency remarked, &quot;Ten years ago the existence of protected areas not owned by the government was unthinkable.&quot; Among the efforts supporting conservation, has been a growing ecotourism industry.

==Protected areas==
24.16% of the Valdivian temperate forests ecoregion is in protected areas.

<text>A rivet is a permanent mechanical fastener. Before being installed, a rivet consists of a smooth cylindrical shaft with a head on one end. The end opposite the head is called the &quot;tail&quot;. On installation, the deformed end is called the &quot;shop head&quot; or buck-tail.

Because there is effectively a head on each end of an installed rivet, it can support tension loads. However, it is much more capable of supporting shear loads (loads perpendicular to the axis of the shaft).

Fastenings used in traditional wooden boat building, such as copper nails and clinch bolts, work on the same principle as the rivet but were in use long before the term &quot;rivet&quot; was introduced and, where they are remembered, are usually classified among nails and bolts respectively.

==History==

Solid rivets are one of the oldest and most reliable types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. Rivet holes have been found in Egyptian spearheads dating back to the Naqada culture of between 4400 and 3000 B.C. Archeologists have also uncovered many Bronze Age swords and daggers with rivet holes where the handles would have been. The rivets themselves were essentially short rods of metal, which metalworkers hammered into a pre-drilled hole on one side and deformed on the other to hold them in place.

High-strength bolts have largely replaced structural steel rivets. Indeed, the latest steel construction specifications published by AISC (the 14th Edition) no longer cover their installation. The reason for the change is primarily due to the expense of skilled workers required to install high-strength structural steel rivets.

== Installation ==

There are several methods for installing solid rivets.

* Manual with hammer and handset or bucking bar
* Pneumatic hammers
* Handheld squeezers
* Riveting machines
* Pin hammer, rivet set

Rivets small enough and soft enough are often &quot;bucked&quot;. The term &quot;bucked&quot; comes from a name for one of the two parts of a rivet. The head of the rivet is one part, and is the part that the air-hammer strikes. The other part is referred to as the &quot;bucktail&quot;, and is the part that the bucking bar is held against. Hence the terms &quot;bucking bar&quot;, &quot;bucked&quot;, and &quot;buck-man&quot;. In this process, the installer places a rivet gun against the factory head and holds a bucking bar against the tail or a hard working surface. The bucking bar is a specially shaped solid block of metal. The rivet gun provides a series of high-impulse forces that upsets and work hardens the tail of the rivet between the work and the inertia of the bucking bar. Rivets that are large or hard may be more easily installed by squeezing instead. In this process, a tool in contact with each end of the rivet clinches to deform the rivet.

Rivets may also be upset by hand, using a ball-peen hammer. The head is placed in a special hole made to accommodate it, known as a rivet-set. The hammer is applied to the buck-tail of the rivet, rolling an edge so that it is flush against the material.

Until relatively recently, structural steel connections were either welded or riveted. Whereas two relatively unskilled workers can install and tighten high-strength bolts, it normally takes four skilled workers to install rivets (warmer, catcher, holder, basher).

At a central location near the areas being riveted, a furnace was set up. Rivets were placed in the furnace and heated to approximately 900 °C or &quot;cherry red&quot;. The rivet warmer or &quot;cook&quot; used tongs to remove individual rivets and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be riveted. The &quot;catcher&quot; (usually) caught the rivet in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. The catcher inserted the rivet into the hole to be riveted, then quickly turned to catch the next rivet. The &quot;holder up&quot; or &quot;holder on&quot; would hold a heavy &quot;bucking bar&quot; or dolly or another (larger) pneumatic jack against the round &quot;shop head&quot; of the rivet, while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a hammer or pneumatic rivet hammer with a &quot;rivet set&quot; to the tail of the rivet, making it mushroom against the joint forming the &quot;field head&quot; into its final domed shape. Alternatively, the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a counter-sunk hole. On cooling, the rivet contracted axially exerting the clamping force on the joint. Before the use of pneumatic hammers, e.g. in the construction of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, the person who hammered the rivet was known as the &quot;basher&quot;.

== Types ==

=== Solid rivets ===

Solid rivets consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or rivet gun. A rivet compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of rivet. This tool is mainly used on rivets close to the edge of the fastened material since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A rivet compression tool does not require two people and is generally the most foolproof way to install solid rivets.

Solid rivets are used in applications where reliability and safety count. A typical application for solid rivets can be found within the structural parts of aircraft. Hundreds of thousands of solid rivets are used to assemble the frame of a modern aircraft. Such rivets come with rounded (universal) or 100° countersunk heads. Typical materials for aircraft rivets are aluminium alloys (2017, 2024, 2117, 7050, 5056, 55000, V-65), titanium, and nickel-based alloys (e.g., Monel). Some aluminium alloy rivets are too hard to buck and must be softened by solution treating (precipitation hardening) prior to being bucked. &quot;Ice box&quot; aluminium alloy rivets harden with age, and must likewise be annealed and then kept at sub-freezing temperatures (hence the name &quot;ice box&quot;) to slow the age-hardening process. Steel rivets can be found in static structures such as bridges, cranes, and building frames.

The setting of these fasteners requires access to both sides of a structure. Solid rivets are driven using a hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically actuated squeezing tool or even a handheld hammer. Applications where only one side is accessible require &quot;blind&quot; rivets.

Solid rivets are also used by some artisans in the construction of modern reproduction of medieval armour, jewellery and metal couture.

=== Semi-tubular rivets ===

Semi-tubular rivets (also known as tubular rivets) are similar to solid rivets, except they have a partial hole (opposite the head) at the tip. The purpose of this hole is to reduce the amount of force needed for application by rolling the tubular portion outward. The force needed to apply a semi-tubular rivet is about 1/4 of the amount needed to apply a solid rivet. Tubular rivets are sometimes preferred for pivot points (a joint where movement is desired) since the swelling of the rivet is only at the tail. The type of equipment used to apply semi-tubular rivets ranges from prototyping tools to fully automated systems. Typical installation tools (from lowest to highest price) are hand set, manual squeezer, pneumatic squeezer, kick press, impact riveter, and finally PLC-controlled robotics. The most common machine is the impact riveter and the most common use of semi-tubular rivets is in lighting, brakes, ladders, binders, HVAC duct-work, mechanical products, and electronics. They are offered from 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) to 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) in diameter (other sizes are considered highly special) and can be up to 8 inches (203 mm) long. A wide variety of materials and platings are available, most common base metals are steel, brass, copper, stainless, aluminum and the most common platings are zinc, nickel, brass, tin. Tubular rivets are normally waxed to facilitate proper assembly. An installed tubular rivet has a head on one side, with a rolled-over and exposed shallow blind hole on the other.

=== Blind rivets ===


Blind rivets, commonly referred to as &quot;pop&quot; rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black &amp; Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a nail-like mandrel through the center which has a &quot;necked&quot; or weakened area near the head. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel through the rivet. The compression force between the head of the mandrel and the tool expands the diameter of the tube throughout its length, locking the sheets being fastened if the hole was the correct size. The head of the mandrel also expands the blind end of the rivet to a diameter greater than that of the drilled hole, compressing the fastened sheets between the head of the rivet and the head of the mandrel. At a predetermined tension, the mandrel breaks at the necked location. With open tubular rivets, the head of the mandrel may or may not remain embedded in the expanded portion of the rivet, and can come loose at a later time. More expensive closed-end tubular rivets are formed around the mandrel so the head of the mandrel is always retained inside the blind end after installation. &quot;Pop&quot; rivets can be fully installed with access to only one side of a part or structure.

Prior to the invention of blind rivets, installation of a rivet typically required access to both sides of the assembly: a rivet hammer on one side and a bucking bar on the other side. In 1916, Royal Navy reservist and engineer Hamilton Neil Wylie filed a patent for an &quot;improved means of closing tubular rivets&quot; (granted May 1917). In 1922 Wylie joined the British aircraft manufacturer Armstrong-Whitworth Ltd to advise on metal construction techniques; here he continued to develop his rivet design with a further 1927 patent that incorporated the pull-through mandrel and allowed the rivet to be used &quot;blind&quot;. By 1928, the George Tucker Eyelet Company, of Birmingham, England, produced a &quot;cup&quot; rivet based on the design. It required a separate GKN mandrel and the rivet body to be hand-assembled prior to use for the building of the Siskin III aircraft. Together with Armstrong-Whitworth, the Geo. Tucker Co. further modified the rivet design to produce a one-piece unit incorporating a mandrel and rivet. This product was later developed in aluminium and trademarked as the &quot;POP&quot; rivet. The United Shoe Machinery Co. produced the design in the U.S. as inventors such as Carl Cherry and Lou Huck experimented with other techniques for expanding solid rivets.

They are available in flat head, countersunk head, and modified flush head with standard diameters of 1/8, 5/32, and 3/16 inch. Blind rivets are made from soft aluminum alloy, steel (including stainless steel), copper, and Monel.

There are also &quot;&quot;, which are designed to take shear and tensile loads.

The rivet body is normally manufactured using one of three methods: wire (the most common method), tube (common in longer lengths, not normally as strong as wire) and sheet (least popular and generally the weakest option).

There is a vast array of specialty blind rivets that are suited for high strength or plastic applications. Typical types include:

* TriFold: a rivet that splits into three equal legs like a molly bolt. Typically used in soft plastics where a wide footprint is needed at the rear surface. Used in automotive interiors and vinyl fences
* Structural rivet(a): an &quot;external&quot; mechanically locked structural blind rivet that is used where a watertight, vibration resistant connection is of importance. Typically used in manufacture or repair of truck bodies. A special nosepiece is required to apply this rivet
* Structural rivet(b): an &quot;internal&quot; mechanically locked structural blind rivet that is used where a watertight, vibration resistant connection is of importance. Typically used in manufacture or repair of truck bodies

Internally and externally locked structural blind rivets can be used in aircraft applications because, unlike other types of blind rivets, the locked mandrels cannot fall out and are watertight. Since the mandrel is locked into place, they have the same or greater shear-load-carrying capacity as solid rivets and may be used to replace solid rivets on all but the most critical stressed aircraft structures.

The typical assembly process requires the operator to install the rivet in the nose of the tool by hand and then actuate the tool. However, in recent years automated riveting systems have become popular in an effort to reduce assembly costs and repetitive disorders. The cost of such tools ranges from US$1,500 for auto-feed pneumatics to US$50,000 for fully robotic systems.

While structural blind rivets using a locked mandrel are common, there are also aircraft applications using &quot;non-structural&quot; blind rivets where the reduced, but still predictable, strength of the rivet without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round-head rivet, taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these rivets use rivet strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.

=== Oscar rivets ===
Oscar rivets are similar to blind rivets in appearance and installation but have splits (typically three) along the hollow shaft. These splits cause the shaft to fold and flare out (similar to the wings on a toggle bolt&#x27;s nut) as the mandrel is drawn into the rivet. This flare (or flange) provides a wide bearing surface that reduces the chance of rivet pull-out. This design is ideal for high-vibration applications where the back surface is inaccessible.

A version of the Oscar rivet is the Olympic rivet which uses an aluminum mandrel that is drawn into the rivet head. After installation, the head and mandrel are shaved off flush resulting in an appearance closely resembling a brazier head-driven rivet. They are used in the repair of Airstream trailers to replicate the look of the original rivets.
=== Drive rivet ===
A drive rivet is a form of blind rivet that has a short mandrel protruding from the head that is driven in with a hammer to flare out the end inserted in the hole. This is commonly used to rivet wood panels into place since the hole does not need to be drilled all the way through the panel, producing an aesthetically pleasing appearance. They can also be used with plastic, metal, and other materials and require no special setting tool other than a hammer and possibly a backing block (steel or some other dense material) placed behind the location of the rivet while hammering it into place. Drive rivets have less clamping force than most other rivets. Drive screws, possibly another name for drive rivets, are commonly used to hold nameplates into blind holes. They typically have spiral threads that grip the side of the hole.

=== Friction-lock rivet ===
These resemble an expanding bolt except the shaft snaps below the surface when the tension is sufficient. The blind end may be either countersunk (&#x27;flush&#x27;) or dome-shaped.

One early form of blind rivet that was the first to be widely used for aircraft construction and repair was the Cherry friction-lock rivet. Originally, Cherry friction locks were available in two styles, hollow shank pull-through and self-plugging types. The pull-through type is no longer common; however, the self-plugging Cherry friction-lock rivet is still used for repairing light aircraft.

Cherry friction-lock rivets are available in two head styles, universal and 100-degree countersunk. Furthermore, they are usually supplied in three standard diameters, 1/8, 5/32 and 3/16 inch.

A friction-lock rivet cannot replace a solid shank rivet, size for size. When a friction lock is used to replace a solid shank rivet, it must be at least one size larger in diameter because the friction-lock rivet loses considerable strength if its center stem falls out due to vibrations or damage.

=== Self-piercing rivets ===

Self-pierce riveting (SPR) is a process of joining two or more materials using an engineered rivet. Unlike solid, blind and semi-tubular rivets, self-pierce rivets do not require a drilled or punched hole.

SPRs are cold-forged to a semi-tubular shape and contain a partial hole to the opposite end of the head. The end geometry of the rivet has a chamfered poke that helps the rivet pierce the materials being joined. A hydraulic or electric servo rivet setter drives the rivet into the material, and an upsetting die provides a cavity for the displaced bottom sheet material to flow. The SPR process is described in here SPR process.

The self-pierce rivet fully pierces the top sheet material(s) but only partially pierces the bottom sheet. As the tail end of the rivet does not break through the bottom sheet it provides a water or gas-tight joint. With the influence of the upsetting die, the tail end of the rivet flares and interlocks into the bottom sheet forming a low profile button.

Rivets need to be harder than the materials being joined. they are heat treated to various levels of hardness depending on the material&#x27;s ductility and hardness. Rivets come in a range of diameters and lengths depending on the materials being joined; head styles are either flush countersunk or pan heads.

Depending on the rivet setter configuration, i.e. hydraulic, servo, stroke, nose-to-die gap, feed system etc., cycle times can be as quick as one second. Rivets are typically fed to the rivet setter nose from tape and come in cassette or spool form for continuous production.

Riveting systems can be manual or automated depending on the application requirements; all systems are very flexible in terms of product design and ease of integration into a manufacturing process.

SPR joins a range of dissimilar materials such as steel, aluminum, plastics, composites and pre-coated or pre-painted materials. Benefits include low energy demands, no heat, fumes, sparks or waste and very repeatable quality.

=== Compression rivets ===

Compression rivets are commonly used for functional or decorative purposes on clothing, accessories, and other items. They have male and female halves that press together, through a hole in the material. &quot;Double cap rivets&quot; have aesthetic caps on both sides. &quot;Single cap rivets&quot; have caps on just one side; the other side is low profile with a visible hole. &quot;Cutlery rivets&quot; are commonly used to attach handles to knife blades and other utensils.

== Surface finish ==

A &quot;flush rivet&quot; is used primarily on external metal surfaces where good appearance and the elimination of unnecessary aerodynamic drag are important. A flush rivet takes advantage of a countersunk or dimpled hole; they are also commonly referred to as countersunk rivets. Countersunk or flush rivets are used extensively on the exterior of aircraft for aerodynamic reasons such as reduced drag and turbulence. Additional post-installation machining may be performed to perfect the airflow.

Flush riveting was invented in America in the 1930s by Vladimir Pavlecka and his team at Douglas Aircraft. The technology was used by Howard Hughes in the design and production of his H-1 plane, the Hughes H-1 Racer.

== Materials ==

The last commonly used high-strength structural steel rivets were designated ASTM A502 Grade 1 rivets.

Such riveted structures may be insufficient to resist seismic loading from earthquakes if the structure was not engineered for such forces, a common problem of older steel bridges. This is because a hot rivet cannot be properly heat treated to add strength and hardness. In the seismic retrofit of such structures, it is common practice to remove critical rivets with an oxygen torch, precision ream the hole, then insert a machined and heat-treated bolt.

The main official standards relate more to technical parameters such as ultimate tensile strength and surface finishing than physical length and diameter. They are:

Rivet diameters are commonly measured in -inch increments and their lengths in -inch increments, expressed as &quot;dash numbers&quot; at the end of the rivet identification number. A &quot;dash 3 dash 4&quot; (XXXXXX-3-4) designation indicates a -inch diameter and -inch (or -inch) length. Some rivets lengths are also available in &quot;half sizes&quot;, and have a dash number such as –3.5 ( inch) to indicate they are half-size. The letters and digits in a rivet&#x27;s identification number that precede its dash numbers indicate the specification under which the rivet was manufactured and the head style. On many rivets, a size in 32nds may be stamped on the rivet head. Other makings on the rivet head, such as small raised or depressed dimples or small raised bars indicate the rivet&#x27;s alloy. To become a proper fastener, a rivet should be placed in a hole ideally 4–6 thousandths of an inch larger in diameter. This allows the rivet to be easily and fully inserted, then setting allows the rivet to expand, tightly filling the gap and maximizing strength.

Rivet diameters and lengths are measured in millimeters. Conveniently, the rivet diameter relates to the drill required to make a hole to accept the rivet, rather than the actual diameter of the rivet, which is slightly smaller. This facilitates the use of a simple drill-gauge to check both rivet and drill are compatible. For general use, diameters between 2 mm – 20 mm and lengths from 5 mm – 50 mm are common. The design type, material and any finish is usually expressed in plain language (often English).

== Applications ==

Before welding techniques and bolted joints were developed, metal-framed buildings and structures such as the Eiffel Tower, Shukhov Tower and the Sydney Harbour Bridge were generally held together by riveting, as were automobile chassis. Riveting is still widely used in applications where light weight and high strength are critical, such as in an aircraft. Sheet metal alloys used in aircraft skins are generally not welded, because the aircraft in high-speed flight skins will be stretched, extrusion may occur deformation and change in material properties. Riveting can reduce the vibration transmission between joints, thereby reducing the risk of cracking. The firmness is better and more reliable against such repeated stress changes. In order to reduce air resistance, countersunk rivets are generally used in aircraft skins.

A large number of countries used rivets in the construction of armored tanks during World War II, including the M3 Lee (General Grant) manufactured in the United States. However, many countries soon learned that rivets were a large weakness in tank design since if a tank was hit by a large projectile it would dislocate the rivets and they would fly around the inside of the tank and injure or kill the crew, even if the projectile did not penetrate the armor. Some countries such as Italy, Japan, and Britain used rivets in some or all of their tank designs throughout the war for various reasons, such as lack of welding equipment or inability to weld very thick plates of armor effectively.

Blind rivets are used almost universally in the construction of plywood road cases.

Common but more exotic uses of rivets are to reinforce jeans and to produce the distinctive sound of a sizzle cymbal.

== Joint analysis ==

The stress and shear in a rivet are analyzed like a bolted joint. However, it is not wise to combine rivets with bolts and screws in the same joint. Rivets fill the hole where they are installed to establish a very tight fit (often called an interference fit). It is difficult or impossible to obtain such a tight fit with other fasteners. The result is that rivets in the same joint with loose fasteners carry more of the load—they are effectively stiffer. The rivet can then fail before it can redistribute load to the other loose-fit fasteners like bolts and screws. This often causes catastrophic failure of the joint when the fasteners &quot;unzip&quot;. In general, a joint composed of similar fasteners is the most efficient because all fasteners reach capacity simultaneously.

== Testing ==
A hammer is also used to &quot;ring&quot; an installed rivet, as a non-destructive test for tightness and imperfections. The inspector taps the head (usually the factory head) of the rivet with the hammer while touching the rivet and base plate lightly with the other hand and judges the quality of the audibly returned sound and the feel of the sound traveling through the metal to the operator&#x27;s fingers. A rivet tightly set in its hole returns a clean and clear ring, while a loose rivet produces a recognizably different sound.

A blind rivet has strength properties that can be measured in terms of shear and tensile strength. Occasionally rivets also undergo performance testing for other critical features, such as pushout force, break load and salt spray resistance. A standardized destructive test according to the Inch Fastener Standards is widely accepted.

The shear test involves installing a rivet into two plates at specified hardness and thickness and measuring the force necessary to shear the plates. The tensile test is basically the same, except that it measures the pullout strength. Per the IFI-135 standard, all blind rivets produced must meet this standard. These tests determine the strength of the rivet, and not the strength of the assembly. To determine the strength of the assembly a user must consult an engineering guide or the Machinery&#x27;s Handbook.

<text>Cuthred (Old English: &quot;Cuþræd&quot;) was the King of Kent from 798 to 807.

After the revolt of Kent under Eadberht III Præn was defeated in 798 by Coenwulf, Cuthred was established as a client king. During Cuthred&#x27;s reign, the Archbishopric of Lichfield was formally abolished at the Council of Clovesho on 12 October 803, and the Archbishopric of Canterbury thus regained the status of which Offa of Mercia had sought to deprive it. Cuthred&#x27;s reign also saw the first raids on Kent by the Vikings. After his death in 807, Cœnwulf seems to have acted as King of Kent.

Cuthred died in 807, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. He issued coins and charters. His surviving charters are both dated 805, one precisely to 26 July 805, in the eighth year of his reign, so his accession fell between 27 July 797 and 26 July 798. In two charters issued by Cœnwulf, King of Mercia, he is described as brother of that king.

==Family==
Cuthred has been identified as one of three known sons of Cuthberht of Mercia, his brothers were Coenwulf (King of Mercia 796-821) and Ceolwulf (King of Mercia 821-823)

Cuthred has been identified as the father of Coenwald, and may also be the father of Cyneberht.

<doc id="509036" wikidata="Q120647" url="?curid=509036" title="Moshe Greenberg">
<text>Moshe Greenberg (; July 10, 1928 – May 15, 2010) was an American rabbi, Bible scholar, and professor emeritus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

==Biography==
Moshe Greenberg was born in Philadelphia in 1928. Raised in a Hebrew-speaking Zionist home, he studied Bible and Hebrew literature from his youth. His father, Rabbi Simon Greenberg, was the rabbi of Har Zion Temple and one of the most important leaders of the Conservative movement. Moshe Greenberg received his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1954, studying Bible and Assyriology under E. A. Speiser; simultaneously, he studied post-Biblical Judaica at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), where he was ordained as a rabbi. Greenberg was married to Evelyn Gelber and had three sons. He died in Jerusalem after a long illness.

==Academic and literary career==
Greenberg taught Bible and Judaica at the University of Pennsylvania from 1964-1970. He held a chair in Jewish studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, an institution at which he had taught since 1970. He also taught at Swarthmore College, the JTSA, the University of California, Berkeley and the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies. Greenberg was editor-in-chief of the Ketuvim section of the Jewish Publication Society of America&#x27;s new English translation of the Bible. He was the author of ten books and numerous articles. From 1994-1995 he held a fellowship at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, doing research in Historiography.

==Scholarship==
Greenberg was the first Jewish Bible scholar appointed to a position in a secular university after World War II and had an important influence on the development of Biblical scholarship. He focused on the phenomenology of biblical religion and law, the theory and practice of interpreting biblical texts, and the role of the Bible in Jewish thought. In the area of prayer, Greenberg studied the development of biblical petition and praise, which he portrayed as &quot;a vehicle of humility, an expression of un-selfsufficiency, which in biblical thought, is the proper stance of humans before God&quot; (Studies, 75-108). He showed that the prose prayers embedded in biblical narratives reflect the piety of commoners, and reasoned that the frequency of spontaneous prayer strengthened the egalitarian tendency of Israelite religion which led to the establishment of the synagogue. In the area of biblical law, Greenberg argued that &quot;the law [is] the expression of underlying postulates or values of culture&quot; and that differences between biblical and ancient Near Eastern laws were not reflections of different stages of social development but of different underlying legal and religious principles (Studies, 25-41). Analyzing economic, social, political, and religious laws in the Torah, he showed that they dispersed authority throughout society and prevented the monopolization of prestige and power by narrow elite groups (Studies, 51-61). In his commentaries on Exodus (1969) and Ezekiel (1983, 1997), Greenberg developed a &quot;holistic&quot; method of exegesis, redirecting attention from the text&#x27;s &quot;hypothetically reconstructed elements&quot; to the biblical books as integral wholes and products of thoughtful and artistic design. Greenberg&#x27;s studies of Jewish thought include studies of the intellectual achievements of medieval Jewish exegesis, investigations of rabbinic reflections on defying illegal orders (Studies, 395-403), and attitudes toward members of other religions (Studies, 369-393; &quot;A Problematic Heritage&quot;). He argued that a Scripture-based religion must avoid fundamentalism through selectivity and re-prioritizing values.

==Awards==
* In 1961, Greenberg was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.
* He was also awarded the Harrison Prize for Distinguished Teaching and Research.
* In 1994, he was awarded the Israel Prize in Bible. Greenberg also taught at Beyt Midrash leShalom, the Peace Study Center sponsored jointly by the Israeli Religious Peace Movement Netivot Shalom and by Tikkun Magazine.
