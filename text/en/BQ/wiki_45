<text>Jacques Rivette (; 1 March 1928 – 29 January 2016) was a French film director and film critic most commonly associated with the French New Wave and the film magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;. He made twenty-nine films, including &quot;L&#x27;Amour fou&quot; (1969), &quot;Out 1&quot; (1971), &quot;Celine and Julie Go Boating&quot; (1974), and &quot;La Belle Noiseuse&quot; (1991). His work is noted for its improvisation, loose narratives, and lengthy running times.

Inspired by Jean Cocteau to become a filmmaker, Rivette shot his first short film at age twenty. He moved to Paris to pursue his career, frequenting Henri Langlois&#x27; Cinémathèque Française and other ciné-clubs; there, he met François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol and other future members of the New Wave. Rivette began writing film criticism, and was hired by André Bazin for &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; in 1953. In his criticism, he expressed an admiration for American films – especially those of genre directors such as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray – and was deeply critical of mainstream French cinema. Rivette&#x27;s articles, admired by his peers, were considered the magazine&#x27;s best and most aggressive writings, particularly his 1961 article &quot;On Abjection&quot; and his influential series of interviews with film directors co-written with Truffaut. He continued making short films, including &quot;Le Coup de Berger&quot;, which is often cited as the first New Wave film. Truffaut later credited Rivette with developing the movement.

Although he was the first New Wave director to begin work on a feature film, &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot; was not released until 1961, by which time Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard released their own first features and popularised the movement worldwide. Rivette became editor of &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; during the early 1960s and publicly fought French censorship of his second feature film, &quot;The Nun&quot; (1966). He then re-evaluated his career, developing a unique cinematic style with &quot;L&#x27;amour fou&quot;. Influenced by the political turmoil of May 68, improvisational theatre and an in-depth interview with filmmaker Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold on camera. This technique led to the thirteen-hour &quot;Out 1&quot; which, although rarely screened, is considered a Holy Grail of cinephiles. His films of the 1970s, such as &quot;Celine and Julie Go Boating&quot;, often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years.

During the early 1980s, he began a business partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette&#x27;s output increased from then on, and his film &quot;La Belle Noiseuse&quot; received international praise. He retired after completing &quot;Around a Small Mountain&quot; (2009), and it was revealed three years later that he had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Very private about his personal life, Rivette was briefly married to photographer and screenwriter Marilù Parolini during the early 1960s and later married Véronique Manniez.

==Biography==
===1928–1950: Early life and move to Paris===
Jacques Pierre Louis Rivette was born in Rouen, Seine-Maritime, France, to André Rivette and Andrée Amiard, into a family &quot;where everyone is a pharmacist&quot;. According to childhood friend André Ruellan, Rivette&#x27;s father was a skilled painter who loved opera. His younger sister said that their home in Rouen was next to a cinema theatre, where she remembered watching Pathé Baby&#x27;s &quot;Felix le Chat&quot; cartoons with Rivette and their grandparents. Rivette, educated at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille, said that he briefly studied literature at the university &quot;just to keep myself occupied&quot;. Inspired by Jean Cocteau&#x27;s book about the filming of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1946), Rivette decided to pursue filmmaking and began frequenting ciné-clubs. In 1948, he shot his first short film, &quot;Aux Quatre Coins&quot;, in Rouen&#x27;s Côte Sainte-Catherine section. The following year, he moved to Paris with friend, Francis Bouchet, because &quot;if you wanted to make films it was the only way&quot;. On the day of his arrival, he met future collaborator Jean Gruault, who invited him to see &quot;Les dames du Bois de Boulogne&quot; (1945) at the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin. Éric Rohmer, whose film criticism Rivette admired, gave a talk at the screening.

Although Rivette submitted his film to the Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques because it &quot;was the kind of thing that would have pleased my parents&quot;, he was not accepted by the school. He took courses at the Sorbonne, but began frequenting screenings at Henri Langlois&#x27;s Cinémathèque Française with Bouchet instead of attending classes. At the Cinémathèque, Rivette, Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Suzanne Schiffman, Gruault and Bouchet were immersed in films from the silent and early &quot;talkie&quot; eras that they were previously unfamiliar with. He and this group of young cinephiles became acquainted as they customarily sat in the Cinématographique&#x27;s front row for screenings; Rivette met Truffaut at a screening of &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; (1939), and often sat next to Godard for several months without ever speaking to him before the latter introduced himself. Rivette was active in post-screening debates, and Rohmer said that, in film-quiz competitions at the Studio Parnasse he was &quot;unbeatable&quot;. Rivette credited Langlois&#x27;s screenings and lectures for helping him persevere during his early impoverishment in Paris: &quot;A word from you saved me and opened the doors of the temple&quot;. Unlike his contemporaries, Rivette attended screenings at the Cinémathèque well into the 1970s.

He and his friends also attended screenings at the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin, which was run by Rohmer. Although Rivette began to write film criticism in 1950 for the &quot;Gazette du Cinéma&quot;, founded by Rohmer with Bouchet as his assistant, the magazine ceased publication after five issues; Rivette said that being a critic was never his aim, but called it &quot;a good exercise&quot;. That year he made his second short film, &quot;Le Quadrille&quot;, produced by and starring Godard, who raised the money by stealing and selling his grandfather&#x27;s collection of rare Paul Valéry first editions. Rivette described &quot;Le Quadrille&quot; as a film in which &quot;absolutely nothing happens. It&#x27;s just four people sitting around a table, looking at each other.&quot; According to film critic Tom Milne, it had &quot;a certain hypnotic, obsessional quality as, for 40 minutes, it attempted to show what happens when nothing happens&quot;. When the film was screened at the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin, Rivette recalled, &quot;After ten minutes, people started to leave, and at the end, the only ones who stayed were Jean-Luc and a girl.&quot; Later calling it Lettrist, he said that Isidore Isou, the founder of Lettrism, considered the film &quot;ingenious&quot;.

===1950–1956: Film criticism and &quot;Le Coup du berger&quot;===
After casual acquaintanceship and collaboration, Rivette and his fellow cinephiles became close friends in September 1950 at the Festival Indépendant du Film Maudit (Independent Festival of Accursed Film), a film festival in Biarritz produced by film critics Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, André Bazin and members of Objectif 49 (a group of avant-garde artists). Rivette, Godard, Truffaut and future cinematographer Charles Bitsch, arriving at the gala event in casual dress, were refused entrance by the doorman until Cocteau allowed them to enter. Openly antagonistic to members of Objectif 49, they loudly criticised the festival. The evening cemented the group&#x27;s friendship, earning them a reputation of bohemian &quot;young Turks&quot; and troublemakers. Chabrol, Grualult, Rohmer, and Jean Douchet also attended and roomed together at the Biarritz Lycée dormitory for the festival. Rivette criticised the festival in the November issue of &quot;Gazette du cinéma&quot;, calling Objectif 49 arrogant and claiming a victory over them. He was quickly considered the leader of the group, whom Bazin called the &quot;Hitchcocko-Hawksians.&quot; Rivette and his new friends bonded by spending whole days watching repeated screenings of a film and walking home together talking about what they had seen.

In 1951, Bazin founded a film magazine, &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, and hired most of the &quot;Hitchcocko–Hawksians&quot;; Rivette began writing for the magazine in February 1953. Rivette championed Hollywood directors such as Howard Hawks and Fritz Lang and international directors such as Roberto Rossellini and Kenji Mizoguchi. He was highly critical of established &quot;qualité française&quot; directors, writing that they were afraid to take risks and were corrupted by money. According to &quot;Cahiers&quot; writer Fereydoun Hoveyda, early contributors to the magazine were politically right-wing except for Pierre Kast and Rivette. In early 1954, Rivette and Truffaut (nicknamed &quot;Truffette and Rivaut&quot;) began a series of interviews with film directors whom they admired. The interviews, influential on film criticism, were recorded on a Grundig portable tape recorder weighing over which was never used by journalists. Although most entertainment reporting was limited to sound bites or anecdotes from film actors, Rivette and Truffaut became acquainted with the directors they interviewed and published their in-depth interviews verbatim. From 1954 to 1957, &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; published a series of interviews with noted film directors including Jacques Becker, Abel Gance, Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang, Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini and Orson Welles.

While he wrote criticism, Rivette continued his filmmaking career; during the summer of 1952, he made his third short film, &quot;Le Divertissement&quot;. Charles Bitsch called it &quot;a Rohmer-esque Marivaudage between young men and women.&quot; Rivette, an assistant to Jacques Becker and Jean Renoir, was a cinematographer on Truffaut&#x27;s short film &quot;Une Visite&quot; (1954) and Rohmer&#x27;s short &quot;Bérénice&quot; (1954). Eager to make a feature film, he talked about elaborate adaptions of works by André Gide, Raymond Radiguet and Ernst Jünger. With financial support from Chabrol and producer Pierre Braunberger, Rivette made the 35mm short film &quot;Le Coup du Berger&quot; (1956). Written by Rivette, Chabrol and Bitsch, the film is about a young girl who receives a mink coat from her lover and must hide it from her husband; spoken commentary by Rivette describes the action like moves in a chess game. Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and Jean-Claude Brialy appeared in the film, with Godard, Truffaut, Bitsch and Robert Lachenay as extras. Shot in two weeks in Chabrol&#x27;s apartment, the budget went entirely to purchasing film stock. It was distributed by Braunberger in 1957. Truffaut called &quot;Le Coup du berger&quot; the inspiration for him, Chabrol, Alain Resnais and Georges Franju to make their first films: &quot;It had begun. And it had begun thanks to Jacques Rivette. Of all of us, he was the most fiercely determined to move.&quot; Rohmer praised the film&#x27;s mise-en-scene and wrote that it had &quot;more truth and good cinema than in all the other French films released in the past year.&quot;

===1957–1961: &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot; and the French New Wave===
In 1957, Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini announced that he wanted to produce a series of films about life in France. Several members of the French New Wave submitted scripts that would become their first films, including Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot; (1958), Rohmer&#x27;s &quot;Sign of Leo&quot; (1959) and Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959). Rivette was eager to make a film with Rossellini&#x27;s help and met him along with co-writer Gruault to discuss the Cité Universitaire as a &quot;melting pot of cultures and ideas&quot; in Paris. Rossellini suggested that they research the project; shortly afterwards, they received ₣100,000 for their script, entitled &quot;La Cité&quot;, but Rossellini abandoned the project and went to India to make a film of his own.

Rivette and Gruault revised their story based on Rossellini&#x27;s critique, and wrote &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot;. Its title is a play on Charles Péguy&#x27;s quote, &quot;Paris belongs to no one.&quot; With borrowed equipment, a loan of ₣80,000 from &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; and short film-reel ends provided by Chabrol, the silent film was shot in the summer of 1958 and sound was added the following year. Among Rivette&#x27;s filming locations were the roof of the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt, the Rue des Cannettes, the Place Sorbonne and the Arts bridge. He struggled to finish the film and find distributors.

In &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot;, Anne (Betty Schneider), a young Parisian student rehearsing for a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Pericles&quot;, deals with the sudden death of the play&#x27;s composer, a missing tape recording of its musical score, a secret society seeking world domination, an eccentric, paranoid American journalist, the suicide of the play&#x27;s producer and the mysterious death of her brother. Chabrol, Godard, Jacques Demy and Rivette appear in minor roles.

&quot;Le Beau Serge&quot; and &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; were successful, and at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, Truffaut and Chabrol used their fame to promote &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot; and help Rivette finish the film. According to Truffaut, who obtained funds for its completion, &quot;The release of &quot;Paris nous appartient&quot; is a score for every member of the &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; team&quot;. He helped Rivette premiere it at the Studio des Ursulines on 16 December 1961, followed by a run at the Agriculteurs cinema in Paris. Although reviews of the film were mixed, it was praised by &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;. Pierre Marcabru of &quot;Combat&quot; said, &quot;The connection between image and sound has never been so striking, evocative or necessary&quot;, and Jeander of &quot;Libération&quot; praised the film&#x27;s depiction of &quot;the moral and intellectual confusion of these young people who are repressed by their epoch for more than their elders&quot;. Rivette, who later said &quot;It&#x27;s the film of a sixteen-year-old child, but maybe its naïveté is where its strength lies&quot;, won the Sutherland Trophy for best first film from the British Film Institute.

Despite being the first of his friends to begin work on a feature, Chabrol, Truffaut and Godard had their feature-film debuts distributed before Rivette in what the French press called New Wave cinema. Rivette later compared the New Wave to impressionist painting; the availability of paint in tubes, which allowed artists to paint outdoors, was similar to technological advancements enabling filmmakers to shoot in the streets. Technical innovations such as faster film stock and the portable Nagra sound recorder became available after the director finished &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot;.

===1962–1967: Editor of &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; and &quot;The Nun&quot; controversy===
After the financial failure of &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot;, Rivette unsuccessfully pitched a film adaptation of Denis Diderot&#x27;s novel to producer Georges de Beauregard. Undaunted, Rivette and co-writer Gruault began writing the script. In 1962, Rivette suggested that Godard&#x27;s wife, Anna Karina, would be perfect in the lead role. Godard agreed, but de Beauregard and producer Eric Schulmberger rejected the idea after a Commission de Controle (the French censorship board) review said that it would be banned.

Godard and Karina received funding from theatrical producer Antoine Bourseiller to produce a stage version of . Rivette directed and Godard produced the three-hour play, which opened at the Studio des Champs-Élysées on 6 February 1963 and closed on 5 March. Although the production was a financial failure, it received good reviews and Karina won several awards for her performance; Lotte Eisner called it &quot;the most beautiful theatre I have seen since Bertolt Brecht&quot;. Rivette&#x27;s staging, in the classical style of Marivaux, was intentionally simple. He and Gruault continued reworking the film script (which was finally passed by the censorship board), but Bourseiller could not afford to produce a film version, so the project was shelved.

After André Bazin&#x27;s death in 1958, Rohmer became editor-in-chief of &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;. By 1962, Rohmer was often at odds with his staff for not promoting New Wave filmmakers. After several financial failures, the directors wanted better publicity, with &quot;Cahiers&quot; an &quot;instrument of combat&quot; of the New Wave. Rohmer profiled New Wave filmmakers in the December 1962 issue before his June 1963 resignation, when Rivette became his successor. Rohmer later said that the pressure to leave &quot;Cahiers&quot; was the best thing that ever happened to him as a film director.

Under Rivette&#x27;s leadership, &quot;Cahiers&quot; changed from a nonpolitical film magazine to a Marxist journal examining the relationship between politics and modern culture. Unlike Rohmer, Rivette allowed writers such as Michel Delahaye and Jean-Louis Comolli to publish articles gravitating towards politics and philosophy and not necessarily related to film. They wrote pieces on Martin Heidegger and Louis Althusser and interviewed non-filmmakers such as Roland Barthes and composer Pierre Boulez. Rivette and Delahaye&#x27;s 1963 interview with Barthes is considered the turning point for &quot;Cahiers&quot; as a magazine analyzing film from a semiotic perspective. Rivette was an ambitious and financially irresponsible editor; shortly after an expensive, 250-page double issue on American films, &quot;Cahiers&quot; needed financial help. It was bought by teen-magazine owner Daniel Filipacchi, and its style became &quot;splashier&quot; and more youth-oriented. Rivette remained editor until April 1965, and was replaced by Jean-Louis Comolli and Jean Narboni. He contributed articles to the magazine until 1969.

Immediately after Rivette left &quot;Cahiers&quot;, Beauregard was ready to make &quot;The Nun&quot; (1966) and Rivette and Gruault again revised their script. Rivette called the script a record of the stage play, with a &quot;highly written texture&quot;. On 31 August 1965, the censors told Beauregard that the film &quot;run[s] the risk of being totally or partially cut&quot;. Beauregard ignored the warning, and Rivette began shooting in October. The film was controversial before its completion; members of the Catholic Church in France began a letter-writing campaign in opposition, and pressurised Paris police commissioner Maurice Papon and Minister of Information Alain Peyrefitte to take action. Both said they would ban it.

Rivette finished &quot;The Nun&quot; in 1966. Although it was approved twice by the censorship board in March, new Minister of Information Yvon Bourges overrode the approvals in April and banned the film. In response, Beauregard began a public campaign in its defense; many journalists, including Godard and Chabrol, wrote editorials demanding the film&#x27;s release. A &quot;Manifesto of the 1,789&quot; in support was signed by Jacques Prévert, Raymond Queneau, Marguerite Duras and several major French book publishers, and many Catholic priests and nuns denounced the ban&#x27;s effect on freedom of speech. Rivette told &quot;Le Figaro Magazine&quot;, &quot;It was as though they had guillotined us&quot;, and in Rouen his father André vehemently defended the film against the city&#x27;s efforts to ban it.

Godard wrote a lengthy editorial criticising Minister of Culture André Malraux. Shortly afterwards, Malraux publicly defended &quot;The Nun&quot;, allowing it to premiere at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, where it was not subject to censorship. At Cannes the film was critically praised, and Beauregard later successfully sued the censorship board. French President Charles de Gaulle called the controversy &quot;silly&quot;, and ordered newly appointed Minister of Information Georges Gorce to lift the ban. &quot;The Nun&quot; was finally released on 26 July 1967, with the publicity helping make it Rivette&#x27;s only hit film to that point. Although it received many good reviews, Guy Daussois of &quot;Le Populaire&quot; said that it was &quot;marked by a schematisation and over-simplicity that is rarely encountered, with absolutely no human depth&quot;.

&quot;The Nun&quot; starred Karina as Suzanne Simonin, as a young woman forced into a convent by her family, who is physically and psychologically tortured. She attempts to escape while dealing with her hateful mother, an empathetic mother superior, an indifferent attorney, a lesbian nun and a sympathetic-but-lustful monk. According to Rivette, &quot;The shooting of was difficult ... I was troubled because we had done the piece before as a play with the sentiments, rehearsals, etc, and I realized when I shot the film that since the people were doing the same text, the same words, my mind was wandering and I was no longer listening to the words&quot;. Karina described Rivette&#x27;s direction as hyperactive; he was constantly &quot;darting in and out of all corners ... always looking at this or that detail.&quot;

After the controversy surrounding &quot;The Nun&quot;, Rivette made a series of documentaries on director Jean Renoir for the French television series &quot;Cinéastes de notre temps&quot; which aired in 1966 as &quot;Jean Renoir, le patron&quot;. Around this time, Rivette and Gruault worked on a script for &quot;The Taking of Power by Louis XIV&quot;; Rivette decided that he did not want to direct another costume drama, and Rossellini directed the film in 1966.

===1968–1972: Political activism and cinematic style===
In February 1968, Henri Langlois was ousted from the Cinémathèque Francaise by Malraux and Minister of Cultural Affairs Pierre Moinot; a government-appointed board of directors assumed control, and Rivette and his old friends reunited to fight for Langlois&#x27; reinstatement. With the &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; office as their headquarters, current and former staff members, including Rivette, Truffaut, Godard, Rohmer and Chabrol, began mass letter-writing and telephone campaigns to recruit support. Within days, filmmakers from around the world announced that they would halt screenings of their films unless Langlois was reinstated. Journalists from &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Combat&quot; expressed support, and on 12 February several hundred members of the film industry protested outside the Cinémathèque. Two days later, a protest by over 3,000 people was met by club-wielding police. Rivette spoke at a press conference and led a charge past one of the police barricades, briefly entering the Cinémathèque with Anne Wiazemsky. In March 1968, Rivette was appointed to an advisory committee, and the following month Langlois was reinstated in the Cinémathèque.

The protests led to the creation of the Etats généraux du cinéma Francais, a committee of film-industry workers who wanted more freedom to make films and less control by the Centre national de la cinématographie. At a May meeting attended by Rivette, the committee called for a strike by film-industry workers and a shutdown of the 1968 Cannes Film Festival in solidarity. Rivette called Truffaut at Cannes with the news, and Truffaut, Godard and other directors stopped the festival. In Paris, the Etats généraux du cinéma Francais organised mass street protests as part of the May 68 protest movement.

Rivette&#x27;s next film was &quot;L&#x27;amour fou&quot; (1969). Frustrated by filmmaking convention, he wanted to create an improvisational atmosphere. Rivette dispensed with a script, shot list and specific direction, experimenting with scenarios and groups of actors. On a limited budget, he shot the film in five weeks. After seeing performances by director Marc&#x27;O&#x27;s experimental-improvisational theatre group, Rivette cast Marc&#x27;O actors Jean-Pierre Kalfon and Bulle Ogier as the leads; other Marc&#x27;O performers appeared in supporting roles. According to the director, he cast Kalfon because of his dissimilarity to Rivette since he was self-conscious about the character&#x27;s autobiographical aspects.

The film has several layers, including a theatrical group rehearsing a production of Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Andromaque&quot;; a TV documentary crew filming the making of the play in 16mm, and a backstage story about the relationship between the stage director (Kalfon) and his wife and lead actress (Ogier). The film ends with an hour-long argument between Kalfon and Ogier, during which they destroy their apartment and its contents. Kalfon was allowed to direct the stage play during filming. Rivette cast André S. Labarthe as the director of the TV crew after working with him on &quot;Cinéastes de notre temps&quot;, allowing him to direct the 16mm footage. Rivette and cinematographer Alain Levent then filmed the stage performers and TV crew in 35mm from a distance without intervening. The film was entirely improvised, including the scene in which Kalfon and Ogier destroy their apartment (which had to be done in a single take for budgetary reasons). Released in 1969, the 252-minute film received positive reviews. &quot;L&#x27;amour fou&quot; gave Rivette his second Sutherland Trophy from the British Film Institute.

The director found his cinematic style during the making of this film. According to Rivette, &quot;With improvisation, you automatically listen&quot; and an author is an &quot;analyst, a person who must listen to what the people say—all words are important. You must listen to all and not have any preconceived ideas as a director&quot;. Invigorated by his new filmmaking technique, Rivette invited over forty actors (including Jean-Pierre Leaud, Juliet Berto, Michael Lonsdale and Bulle Ogier) to each develop a character for a new film without a plot or interaction with each other. He then developed the basic structure for what would become &quot;Out 1&quot; (1971). From April to June 1970, Rivette shot over 30 hours of 16mm footage as his cast improvised a story involving conspiracy theories and theatrical rehearsals.

&quot;Out 1&quot; starred Jean-Pierre Leaud as Colin, a Parisian con artist who pretends to be a deaf-mute and begins receiving anonymous messages referring to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; and Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Histoire des Treize&quot; (&quot;The Thirteen&quot;). Colin becomes obsessed with the messages, and begins to believe that a Utopian secret society like the one in Balzac&#x27;s short story is contacting him. He is led to a boutique and meets Frederique (Juliet Berto), a young thief. Colin and Frederique use stolen letters to track down what they believe is the secret group, Thirteen, at a house where two groups of actors are rehearsing productions of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; and &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;.

&quot;Out 1&quot; was shown only once in its 760-minute original version at the Maison de la Culture in Le Havre, on 9–10 September 1971. Over 300 people attended the weekend-long premiere, and Martin Even of &quot;Le Monde&quot; called it a &quot;voyage beyond cinema&quot; because most of the audience had traveled from Paris to see it. Originally intended as a 12-part television broadcast, the Office de Radiodiffusion-Television Francaise refused to purchase it. With help from Suzanne Schiffman, Rivette spent over a year editing a 260-minute version entitled &quot;Out 1: Spectre&quot; and released in 1974. &quot;Out 1&quot; was highly praised, and become a cult film. Because it was notoriously difficult to see in its entirety, and critics Jonathan Rosenbaum and Dennis Lim have called the film a &quot;Holy Grail&quot; for cinephiles. The first revival screening of the original version was at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February 1989. It was finally shown on French TV during the early 1990s and was first shown in the US at the Museum of the Moving Image in December 2006 to a sold-out audience.

===1973–1982: Fantasy films and nervous breakdown===
During the summer of 1973, Rivette attempted to make &quot;Phénix&quot;, a film about the early-1900s Paris theatrical world which would have starred Jeanne Moreau. Due to budgetary constraints, he was forced to abandon the project. Rivette then made his most critically acclaimed film, &quot;Céline and Julie Go Boating&quot; (1974). &quot;Aller en bateau&quot; (&quot;go boating&quot;) is French slang for &quot;caught up in fiction&quot; or &quot;taken for a ride&quot;. Rivette met with friends, actresses Juliet Berto and Dominique Labourier, to develop two characters and created a plot and script with collaborator Eduardo de Gregorio. He later said that during this pre-production period, he &quot;never had as much [fun]. I don’t believe I ever laughed as much&quot;. Unlike his previous two films, Rivette did not use improvisation during the filming and said that the plot was carefully constructed in advance.

Filled with references to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Jean Cocteau and Marcel Proust, &quot;Céline and Julie Go Boating&quot; begins when Julie (Labourier), and Céline (Berto) meet by chance and become friends. They begin to visit a mysterious &quot;House of Fiction&quot; where the same melodrama (based on two short stories by Henry James) plays out every day, ending with the murder of a young girl by the enigmatic Sophie (Marie-France Pisier). Shot in five weeks during the summer of 1973, &quot;Céline and Julie Go Boating&quot; won the Special Jury Prize at the 1974 Locarno International Film Festival. It was produced by Barbet Schroeder and distributed by Les Films du Losange. Jonathan Rosenbaum praised it, writing that he knew &quot;many women who consider &quot;Céline et Julie vont en bateau&quot; their favourite film about female friendship&quot;.

Rivette then conceived and obtained funding for a series of four films, &quot;Scènes de la vie parallèle&quot;. Each film would revolve around two female leads. Part one was to be a love story, part two a fantasy, part three an adventure and part four a musical comedy. According to Rivette, his intention for the film series was &quot;to invent a new approach to film acting where speech, pared down to essential phrases, precise formulas, would play the role of poetic punctuation. Neither a return to silent cinema nor a pantomime, nor choreography: something else, where the movements of the bodies, their counterpoint and inscription in the space of the screen, will be the basis of [a] &quot;mise-en-scene&quot;.&quot; The tetralogy, reflecting the political situation in France, including the conservative backlash after May &#x27;68 and the election of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, would be tied together by improvised musical scores. Rivette collaborated on the scenarios with de Gregorio and Parolini.

In &quot;Duelle (Une quarantaine)&quot; (1976), the Queen of the Night (Juliet Berto) battles the Queen of the Sun (Bulle Ogier) over a magic diamond which will allow the winner to remain in modern-day Paris. In &quot;Noroît (Une vengeance)&quot; (1976), the pirate Morag (Geraldine Chaplin) seeks revenge against the pirate Giulia (Bernadette Lafont) for killing her brother. &quot;Duelle&quot; was filmed in March and April 1975, and &quot;Noroît&quot; was shot at Brittany in May. De Gregorio saw Cyril Tourneur&#x27;s &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, and suggested it to Rivette. The script, written in 15th-century English, caused some difficulty for the actresses.

In August 1975, Rivette began filming part one of the series: &quot;Marie et Julien&quot;, a love story starring Albert Finney and Leslie Caron. After three days of shooting, Rivette broke down due to nervous exhaustion and production of the series was abandoned. Rivette later said that he &quot;broke down physically... I had overestimated my own strength.&quot; Although Marguerite Duras offered to finish the film, the actors refused to continue without Rivette. In 2003, he said that &quot;Marie et Julien&quot; was based on a true story of a woman who committed suicide. Rivette&#x27;s musical-comedy fourth film would have starred Anna Karina and Jean Marais. &quot;Noroît&quot; premiered in London and was shown at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but was never distributed. It and &quot;Duelle&quot; received mediocre reviews, causing problems for Rivette with the series&#x27; producers. The director said that Susan Sontag enjoyed &quot;Noroît&quot;, and Jean Rouch recognised ancient African myths in its plot, where Rivette had included Celtic myths.

According to the director, it took over a year to recover from his breakdown. Producer Stéphane Tchalgadjieff had renegotiated the contract for the &quot;Scènes de la vie parallèle&quot; series to require only one more film, the intended first or fourth part. Rivette decided that he wanted to film both or neither and made an unrelated film, &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1981). Tchalgadjieff had told him that Maria Schneider wanted to make a film with him and actor Joe Dallesandro and Rivette agreed. Shot in 1978 but not completed until 1981, the film is a detective story about a missing sister and inheritance. Rivette relied on improvisation during its production, which he described after a few days as &quot;going very badly&quot;. Although Schneider was also recovering from an illness and she and Rivette wanted to abandon the project, they were persuaded to continue by the cast and crew. Rivette said, &quot;There were two people in poor health during filming, and there wasn’t any money at all&quot;. Over a year after filming was completed, he added footage of the film&#x27;s composers, Barre Phillips and John Surman, in performance despite its lack of relation to the plot or characters. &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;, theatrically released in 1981, received mediocre reviews.

In 1980, Rivette decided to remake &quot;Out 1&quot;. Ogier, the only original-cast member available for the project, and her daughter Pascale Ogier worked with Rivette on the characters as the director had done a decade earlier. With co-screenwriter Suzanne Schiffman they made the 30-minute short film &quot;Paris s&#x27;en va&quot; (1980) as a sketch for the eventual feature &quot;Le Pont du Nord&quot; (1982), which was distributed in 1982. &quot;Le Pont du Nord&quot; starred Bulle and Pascale Ogier as two women who meet and investigate a strange Snakes and Ladders-like map of Paris and a mysterious man named Max. Rivette had difficulty finding financing, with the Centre national de la cinématographie refusing three times to fund the film. The director accommodated his tight budget by making Bulle Ogier&#x27;s character claustrophobic, because he could not afford many interior scenes. According to Rivette biographer Mary Wiles, as &quot;Paris Belong to Us&quot; is a reflection of France during the 1950s and &quot;Out 1&quot; the 1960s, &quot;Le Pont du Nord&quot; completes a trilogy by reflecting the social and political milieu of 1970s France.

===1983–1991: Partnership with Marignac and increased recognition===
Rivette&#x27;s difficulties in securing financial backing for his films during the late 1970s led him to a business partnership with Pierre Grise Productions and producer Martine Marignac (1946–2022). The company was the chief distributor and financier for all his subsequent films. Their first film, &quot;Love on the Ground&quot; (1984), again concerned a theatrical group and the blurring of fiction and reality. Geraldine Chaplin and Jane Birkin star as members of a theatrical troupe who are invited to appear in a new play resembling the real life of its director (Kalfon) and the mysterious disappearance of his wife.

In a break from his experimental, complex style, Rivette next adapted Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Based on the novel&#x27;s first part and set in 1930s southern France, &quot;Hurlevent&quot; starred three unknown actors: Fabienne Babe as Catherine, Lucas Belvaux as Roch (Heathcliff) and Oliver Cruveiller as Catherine&#x27;s brother, William. &quot;Hurlevent&quot;, Rivette&#x27;s first film in years without his usual troupe of actors and technicians and modeled on Balthus&#x27; India ink illustrations, was released in 1985.

Rivette received critical acclaim for his 1988 film &quot;La Bande des quatre&quot; (&quot;Gang of Four&quot;), about four drama students whose lives playfully alternate from theatre to real life and make-believe. According to the director, who wanted to make a film about young people working on a play, &quot;The work is always much more interesting to show than the result&quot;. The film received an honorable mention at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.

He enjoyed working with the four young actresses in &quot;La Bande des quatre&quot; so much, that Rivette returned to the theatre. The actresses had performed a scene from Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Suréna&quot; in &quot;La Bande des quatre&quot;, so Rivette, the actresses and additional performers rehearsed Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Tite et Bérénice&quot;, Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Bajazet&quot; and a play by Pierre de Marivaux (which was eventually dropped &quot;because he was too hard&quot;). After several weeks of rehearsals, the actresses were ready to perform the two plays, which ran at the Théâtre Gérard Philipe in Saint-Denis from 18 April to 20 May 1989. According to Rivette, Corneille&#x27;s play was more interesting for the actresses; he was &quot;very deep. He&#x27;s an author I find very dense, so full of history, of thought&quot;.

Saul Austerlitz called &quot;La Bande des quatre&quot; success &quot;Rivette’s second wind as a filmmaker&quot;; it led to &quot;La Belle Noiseuse&quot; (&quot;The Beautiful Troublemaker&quot;) (1991), the most-acclaimed film of Rivette&#x27;s later career. Loosely based on the Balzac short story &quot;The Unknown Masterpiece&quot;, it depicts the relationship between reclusive, uninspired painter Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli), his wife and former model Liz (Birkin) and his new model, Marianne (Emmanuelle Béart). Marianne inspires Frenhofer to finish his long-abandoned &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;La Belle Noiseuse&quot;, as Liz and Marianne&#x27;s boyfriend become increasingly jealous. The four-hour film shows the painting&#x27;s progress in real time, one brush stroke at a time, with hand close-ups by French abstract painter Bernard Dufour. According to Rivette, &quot;We tried truly to make a film that did not talk about painting, but approached it&quot;. The film earned him the Grand Prix at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival and the Prix Méliès from the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics. It received five César Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director (Rivette&#x27;s only nomination in that category). Shortly after its Cannes success, a two-hour version, &quot;La Belle Noiseuse: Divertimento&quot;, was theatrically released.

===1992–2009: Later films and retirement===
Rivette then made a two-part film about the life of Joan of Arc entitled &quot;Joan the Maiden&quot;: &quot;Joan the Maiden, Part 1: The Battles&quot; and &quot;Joan the Maiden, Part 2: The Prisons&quot; (1994). Rivette&#x27;s film differed from well-known interpretations of Joan by Carl Theodor Dreyer and Robert Bresson, focusing on her popularity in France rather than her suffering and martyrdom. Loosely based on Rivette&#x27;s memories of Charles Péguy&#x27;s books on Joan, the film was partially shot in his hometown of Rouen. &quot;Joan the Maiden&quot;, starring Sandrine Bonnaire, was released in 1994.

With its large budget, the film was not a financial success. Because of this, Martine Marignac wanted to make a quick, inexpensive film; Rivette, short of ideas, began assembling a cast. He contacted Nathalie Richard, Marianne Denicourt and Laurence Côte, who gave him an idea for a film about 1920s New York City taxi dance halls; this led to &quot;Up, Down, Fragile&quot; (1995). Richard, Denicourt and Côte star as three women struggling to overcome personal obstacles, with musical numbers at a mysterious nightclub commenting on their lives. In the film, a nod to 1920s and 1930s Hollywood backstage musicals, Anna Karina appears as a nightclub singer whose songs refer to her previous films with Godard. &quot;Up, Down, Fragile&quot; was screened at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.

Rivette&#x27;s &quot;film policier&quot;, &quot;Top Secret&quot; (1998), featured Bonnaire as a young scientist whose brother (Grégoire Colin) convinces her that their father was killed by Walser (Jerzy Radziwilowicz) and seeks revenge. Rivette said that the film, loosely based on the Electra myth, was influenced more by Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s lesser-known play than on the classical versions by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. &quot;Top Secret&quot; pays tribute to &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), and biographer Mary Wiles saw influences from Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951) and &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958). Wiles called Rivette&#x27;s three films with Bonnaire feminist, writing that they &quot;reveal a deep personal connection with [Rivette].&quot;

&quot;Va savoir&quot; (2001) starred Jeanne Balibar and Sergio Castellitto as a couple caught up in romantic farce as they attempt to stage Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Come tu mi vuoi&quot; and search for a missing manuscript. Rivette pays tribute to Howard Hawks&#x27; screwball comedies, and includes a reference to &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934). The film&#x27;s theatrical-director character, Ugo, intentionally resembles Gerard in &quot;Paris Belongs to Us&quot;. A longer version, &quot;Va Savoir+&quot; was released the following year. According to Saul Austerlitz, it is &quot;a stunning film, and is yet another peak in Jacques Rivette&#x27;s exceptional career.&quot;

In 2002, Rivette published a book of scripts from three of his unmade films, including &quot;Marie et Julien&quot;. The script for &quot;Marie et Julien&quot; had never been completed, and the footage from the three days of shooting was lost; Rivette worked from &quot;cryptic notes&quot; taken by his assistant, Claire Denis, which cinematographer William Lubtchansky had kept for decades. His work on a readable script for the publication led him to resurrect the project. Rivette, Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent collaborated on the script with the actors during production of the revised &quot;The Story of Marie and Julien&quot; (2003). Rivette cast Béart and Radziwilowicz in the lead roles, saying that it was &quot;more interesting and more exciting&quot; to work with actors with whom he had previously worked, and some dialogue in the original notes was unchanged. Although the film lacked the improvised musical score connecting the first two films, the Madame X character resembles the moon goddess and Marie the sun goddess. It premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival.

In 2007, Rivette made &quot;The Duchess of Langeais&quot;, a faithful adaptation of Balzac&#x27;s novel, and the second of Balzac&#x27;s trilogy, &quot;Histoire des treize&quot;, the introduction to which inspired &quot;Out 1&quot;. Jeanne Balibar and Guillaume Depardieu star as lovers in early 1823 Majorca who are involved in a tormented, frustrating relationship. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2009, Rivette made &quot;36 vues du pic Saint-Loup&quot;; Jane Birkin starred as a woman who returns to her childhood circus troupe after her father dies, and begins a romance with a wealthy Italian drifter (Sergio Castellitto). The film, which premiered at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, was the director&#x27;s last.

==Personal life==

Rivette&#x27;s early years in Paris were impoverished and he was known to live ascetically on minimal resources; Chabrol said that he was very thin and hardly ate, comparing his smile to that of the Cheshire Cat. Gruault described Rivette as &quot;slight, dark-haired and [having] very lively dark eyes in an emaciated visage of a waxy pallor...add to that a forced, nervous smile of someone who has to make constant efforts to win acceptance by a society that he seemed to regard as irremediably hostile.&quot; His opinions were highly regarded among his peers and according to Douchet, &quot;[Rivette] was the great talker. He was the group&#x27;s secret soul, the occult thinker, a bit of a censor.&quot; Godard said, &quot;I might like a film very much, but if Rivette said &#x27;It&#x27;s no good&#x27; then I would agree with him ... it was as though he had a privileged access to cinematographic truth.&quot; Truffaut considered Rivette his best friend, and they were frequently seen at screenings. Truffaut said that in the 1950s, Rivette was the only member of the group already capable of directing a feature film.

Rivette&#x27;s friendship with Rohmer was complex due to Rivette&#x27;s direct role in getting Rohmer fired from &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;. Rivette and Rohmer respected each other, but fought over &quot;Cahiers&quot;&#x27; political and aesthetical positions and financial issues. They became close friends again after Rohmer became interested in Rivette&#x27;s improvisational films, praising &quot;L&#x27;amour fou&quot; and acting in &quot;Out 1&quot;. Rohmer later called &quot;Out 1&quot; &quot;a capitol monument in the history of modern cinema, an essential part of the cinematic heritage.&quot; Rivette also admired Rohmer&#x27;s films and called &quot;Les Rendez-vous de Paris&quot; (1995) a &quot;film of absolute grace.&quot; Several &quot;Cahiers&quot; writers during the Rohmer-era disliked him, such as Douchet, Jean Domarchi, Fereydoun Hoveyda, Phillippe Demonsablon, Claude Beylie and Phillippe d’Hugues, who said that Rivette &quot;had a Saint-Just side, he was an intransigent Jacobin who considered you a moron if you didn’t agree with him. He determined what was moral and right, like a hall monitor.&quot; Antoine de Baecque wrote that these writers respected Rivette, but considered him &quot;brusque, arrogant and dogmatic&quot; and that he &quot;did not hesitate to excommunicate adversaries or mediocrities.&quot; However &quot;Cahiers&quot; writers André Labarthe and Michel Delahaye praised him; Delahaye said that he &quot;was the most brilliant, with a peerless charisma.&quot;

According to David Thomson, Rivette was &quot;famous for having little or no home life, certainly not a private life that overlaps with his work. On his own, he would rather sit in the dark with another movie&quot;; in 1956, he was described as &quot;too aloof and forbiddingly intellectual&quot;. Bulle Ogier described Rivette as very secretive about his life: &quot;I&#x27;ve no idea what he does. I only see him when we&#x27;re filming&quot; or when she bumped into him in public, although she felt close to him. According to Ogier, he had neuroses and anxiety which often prevented him from answering the phone, and talking about his personal life would be indiscreet and a betrayal. Laurence Côte said that joining Rivette&#x27;s inner circle of trusted friends was difficult and required &quot;a number of hurdles to overcome and to respect codes.&quot; Martine Marignac said that Rivette was very modest and shy, and that his circle of close friends grew used to not hearing from him for prolonged periods of time. Marignac also said that &quot;He spends his life going to the movies, but also reading, listening to music. It is clear that the world of reality assaults him.&quot; Jonathan Romney reported that in the 1970s &quot;Rivette sometimes went AWOL from his own shoots, he would invariably be found watching some rarity in one of the Left Bank art cinemas.&quot; Jean-Pierre Léaud, who described Rivette as a close friend, said that he &quot;was the only person who saw everything in a film. And he transmitted everything he saw to us, setting in march our own aesthetic ideas&quot;. The director was the subject of a 1990 documentary, &quot;Jacques Rivette, the Night Watchman&quot;, directed by Claire Denis and Serge Daney. Travis Mackenzie Hoover wrote that the documentary portrays Rivette with &quot;lonerish tendencies&quot; and as &quot;a sort of transient with no home or country, wandering about or loitering in public space instead of staking out some personal &quot;terra firma&quot;.&quot;

In 1960, he appeared briefly with girlfriend Marilù Parolini in Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin&#x27;s cinéma-vérité documentary, &quot;Chronique d&#x27;un été&quot;. Parolini was a secretary at &quot;Cahiers&quot; and, later, an on-set still photographer for Rivette and other New Wave filmmakers. She and Rivette married, but they broke up shortly after the stage version of &quot;The Nun&quot; closed and eventually divorced. They continued a professional relationship; Parolini collaborated with Rivette on &quot;L&#x27;amour fou&quot;, &quot;Duelle&quot;, &quot;Noroît&quot; and &quot;Love on the Ground&quot; as a co-writer, and she took photographs on the sets of &quot;The Nun&quot; and &quot;Celine and Julie Go Boating&quot;. Parolini died in Italy on 21 April 2012.

On 20 April 2012, film critic David Ehrenstein posted online that Rivette had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Bonitzer and Marignac later said that he began to feel the disease&#x27;s effects during the negative experience of filming &quot;36 vues du pic Saint-Loup&quot;. Shooting days were four hours on average and Rivette often lost track of what had already been filmed, which led to the shorter running time than his previous films. In the mid-2000s, Rivette met his second wife Veronique Manniez. They married shortly after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s. Marignac said that, &quot;Thanks to her, he avoided hospitals and was able to stay home.&quot; Rivette and his wife lived in the Rue Cassette section of Paris, where caregivers and doctors attended to him for the last eight years of his life.

==Death==
Rivette died on 29 January 2016 from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the age of 87, in his home in Paris. He was memorialised by President François Hollande as &quot;one of the greatest filmmakers&quot; and praised by Minister of Culture Fleur Pellerin. Members of the French film industry eulogised him; Serge Toubiana said &quot;Rivette was undoubtly the most reflective, thoughtful, the most intellectual figure of the New Wave.&quot; Bulle Ogier wrote that Rivette&#x27;s &quot;body of work was inventive, researched and well structured. Nothing but making films interested him.&quot; Isabelle Regnier wrote about Rivette&#x27;s secretive nature, observing that the mystery about his life &quot;prevails in his grave.&quot; Cinémathèque française director Frédéric Bonnaud called Rivette influential and said that he always tried to invent a new kind of cinema with every film he made. Longtime collaborator Pascale Bonitzer said that &quot;he was a bit of an outsider in the Nouvelle Vague and, at the same time, he was its soul, one of the most radical ones, and the most confidential.&quot; Jean-Michel Frodon said that he incarnated &quot;the spirit of the New Wave.&quot; Hélène Frappat praise his use of mise en scène in regards to his portrayal of women. Martin Scorsese called him a fascinating artist who was &quot;the most experimental of the French New Wave directors.&quot;

Richard Brody called Rivette &quot;the most open and the most reticent of French filmmakers&quot;, claiming that all of Rivette&#x27;s films &quot;represent an effort to capture the fullness of an inner world, a lifetime’s range of obsessions and mysteries.&quot; Unlike other obituaries that focused mostly on his filmmaking career, Brody praised Rivette for his influence on film criticism, singling out his 1961 article &quot;On Abjection&quot;, a review of Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s holocaust film &quot;Kapò&quot;. Brody called it &quot;a touchstone for discussing any film in which atrocities are committed.&quot; In France, Jean-Marie Pottier also praised &quot;On Abjection&quot; as &quot;one of the most famous texts in the history of the French cinephile.&quot; Other film critics to have previously praised the article include Serge Daney and Antoine de Baecque, and Godard&#x27;s famous quote &quot;tracking shots are a question of morality&quot; was influenced by the article. Locarno Film Festival artistic director Carlo Chatrian wrote that Rivette &quot;made the first and best attempt to transpose the ideas of André Bazin into critical writings&quot; and praised such articles as &quot;The Genius of Howard Hawks&quot; and &quot;Letter on Rossellini.&quot;

Rivette was buried on 5 February 2016 in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris, not far from François Truffaut&#x27;s grave. Bonitzer, Marignac and Narboni all spoke at the funeral. Rivette&#x27;s sister and nephews also attended. Véronique Manniez-Rivette told the funeral goers that just as angels are said to sing during moments of silence at twenty minutes past the hour, Rivette had died at 12:20pm. The March 2016 issue of &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; was dedicated to him. In May 2016 the Cinémathèque française announced that Rivette&#x27;s first three short films had been rediscovered by his widow and were being restored and then screened at the Festival Coté Court that June.

<text>Elamite, also known as Hatamtite and formerly as Scythic, Median, Amardian, Anshanian and Susian, is an extinct language that was spoken by the ancient Elamites. It was recorded in what is now southwestern Iran from 2600 BC to 330 BC. Elamite is generally thought to have no demonstrable relatives and is usually considered a language isolate. The lack of established relatives makes its interpretation difficult.

A sizeable number of Elamite lexemes are known from the Achaemenid royal inscriptions – trilingual inscriptions of the Achaemenid Empire, in which Elamite was written using Elamite cuneiform (circa 5th century BC), which is fully deciphered. An important dictionary of the Elamite language, the &quot;Elamisches Wörterbuch&quot; was published in 1987 by W. Hinz and H. Koch. The Linear Elamite script however, one of the scripts used to write the Elamite language circa 2000 BC, has remained elusive until recently.

==Writing system==

The following scripts are known or assumed to have encoded Elamite:
*Proto-Elamite script is the oldest known writing system from Iran. It was used during a brief period of time (c. 3100–2900 BC); clay tablets with Proto-Elamite writing have been found at different sites across Iran. It is thought to have developed from early cuneiform (proto-cuneiform) and consists of more than 1,000 signs. It is thought to be largely logographic and is not deciphered. 
*Linear Elamite is attested in a few monumental inscriptions. It has been described either as a syllabic or logosyllabic writing system. At least part of the script has been deciphered and it has been argued to have developed from Proto-Elamite, although the exact nature of the relationship between the two is disputed (see the main article). Linear Elamite was used for a very brief period of time during the last quarter of the third millennium BC.

Later, Elamite cuneiform, adapted from Akkadian cuneiform, was used from c. 2500 on. Elamite cuneiform was largely a syllabary of some 130 glyphs at any one time and retained only a few logograms from Akkadian but, over time, the number of logograms increased. The complete corpus of Elamite cuneiform consists of about 20,000 tablets and fragments. The majority belong to the Achaemenid era, and contain primarily economic records.

==Linguistic typology==
Elamite is an agglutinative language, and its grammar was characterized by an extensive and pervasive nominal class system. Animate nouns have separate markers for first, second
and third person. It can be said to display a kind of Suffixaufnahme in that the nominal class markers of the head are also attached to any modifiers, including adjectives, noun adjuncts, possessor nouns and even entire clauses.

==History==

The history of Elamite is periodised as follows:

* Old Elamite (c. 2600–1500 BC)
* Middle Elamite (c. 1500–1000 BC)
* Neo-Elamite (1000–550 BC)
* Achaemenid Elamite (550–330 BC)
* Late Elamite?
* Khuzi? (Unknown – 1000 AD)

Middle Elamite is considered the “classical” period of Elamite. The best-attested variety is Achaemenid Elamite, which was widely used by the Achaemenid Empire for official inscriptions as well as administrative records and displays significant Old Persian influence.

Persepolis Administrative Archives were found at Persepolis in 1930s, and they are mostly in Elamite; the remains of more than 10,000 of these cuneiform documents have been uncovered. In comparison, Aramaic is represented by only 1,000 or so original records. These documents represent administrative activity and data flow in Persepolis over more than fifty consecutive years (509 to 457 BC).

Documents from the Old Elamite and early Neo-Elamite stages are relatively scarce. Neo-Elamite is a transitional form in its structure between Middle and Achaemenid Elamite.

The Elamite language may have remained in widespread use after the Achaemenid period. Several rulers of Elymais bore the Elamite name &quot;Kamnaskires&quot; in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. The &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; (c. 80–90 AD) mentions the language as if it was still current. There are no later direct references, but Elamite may be the local language in which, according to the Talmud, the &quot;Book of Esther&quot; was recited annually to the Jews of Susa in the Sasanian Empire (224–642). Between the 8th and 13th centuries AD, various Arabic authors refer to a language called &quot;Khūzī&quot; or &quot;Khūz&quot; spoken in Khuzistan, which was unlike any other Iranian language known to those writers. It is possible that it was &quot;a late variant of Elamite&quot;.

The last original report on the &quot;Khūz&quot; language was written circa 988 by al-Maqdisi, characterizing the Khuzi as bilingual in Arabic and Persian but also speaking an &quot;incomprehensible&quot; language in Ramhormoz. The city had recently become prosperous again after the foundation of a market when it received an influx of foreigners and being a Khuzi was stigmatized at the time. The language probably died in the 11th century. Later authors only mention the language when citing previous work.

==Phonology==
Because of the limitations of the language&#x27;s scripts, its phonology is not well understood.

Its consonants included at least stops , and , sibilants , and (with an uncertain pronunciation), nasals and , liquids and and fricative , which was lost in late Neo-Elamite. Some peculiarities of the spelling have been interpreted as suggesting that there was a contrast between two series of stops (, , as opposed to , , ), but in general, such a distinction was not consistently indicated by written Elamite.

Elamite had at least the vowels , , and and may also have had , which was not generally expressed unambiguously.

Roots were generally CV, (C)VC, (C)VCV or, more rarely, CVCCV (the first C was usually a nasal).

==Morphology==
Elamite is agglutinative but with fewer morphemes per word than, for example, Sumerian or Hurrian and Urartian. It is mostly suffixing.

===Nouns===
The Elamite nominal system is thoroughly pervaded by a noun class distinction, which combines a gender distinction between animate and inanimate with a personal class distinction, corresponding to the three persons of verbal inflection (first, second, third, plural). &lt;br&gt;
The suffixes that express that system are as follows: &lt;br&gt;
Animate: &lt;br&gt;
:1st person singular: &quot;-k&quot;
:2nd person singular: &quot;-t&quot;
:3rd person singular: &quot;-r&quot; or &quot;-Ø&quot;
:3rd person plural: &quot;-p&quot;
Inanimate: &lt;br&gt;
:&quot;-∅&quot;, &quot;-me&quot;, &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-t&quot;
The animate third-person suffix &quot;-r&quot; can serve as a nominalizing suffix and indicate nomen agentis or just members of a class. The inanimate third-person singular suffix &quot;-me&quot; forms abstracts.

Some examples of the use of the noun class suffixes above are the following: 

:&quot;sunki-k&quot; “a king (first person)” i.e. “I, a king”

: &quot;sunki-r&quot; “a king (third person)”

:&quot;nap-Ø&quot; or &quot;nap-ir&quot; “a god (third person)”

:&quot;sunki-p&quot; “kings”

:&quot;nap-ip&quot; “gods” 

: &quot;sunki-me&quot; “kingdom, kingship”

:&quot;hal-Ø&quot; “town, land”

: &quot;siya-n&quot; “temple”

: &quot;hala-t&quot; “mud brick”.

Modifiers follow their (nominal) heads. In noun phrases and pronoun phrases, the suffixes referring to the head are appended to the modifier, regardless of whether the modifier is another noun (such as a possessor) or an adjective. Sometimes the suffix is preserved on the head as well:

:&quot;u šak X-k(i)&quot; = “I, the son of X”

:&quot;X šak Y-r(i)&quot; = “X, the son of Y”

:&quot;u sunki-k Hatamti-k&quot; = “I, the king of Elam”

:&quot;sunki Hatamti-p&quot; (or, sometimes, &quot;sunki-p Hatamti-p&quot;) = “the kings of Elam”

:&quot;temti riša-r&quot; = “great lord” (lit. “lord great”)

:&quot;riša-r nap-ip-ir&quot; = “greatest of the gods” (lit. &quot;great of the gods&quot;)

:&quot;nap-ir u-ri&quot; = “my god” (lit. “god of me”)

:&quot;hiya-n nap-ir u-ri-me&quot; = “the throne hall of my god”

:&quot;takki-me puhu nika-me-me&quot; = “the life of our children”

:&quot;sunki-p uri-p u-p(e)&quot; = ”kings, my predecessors” (lit. “kings, predecessors of me”)

This system, in which the noun class suffixes function as derivational morphemes as well as agreement markers and indirectly as subordinating morphemes, is best seen in Middle Elamite. It was, to a great extent, broken down in Achaemenid Elamite, where possession and, sometimes, attributive relationships are uniformly expressed with the “genitive case” suffix &quot;-na&quot; appended to the modifier: e.g. &quot;šak X-na&quot; “son of X”. The suffix &quot;-na&quot;, which probably originated from the inanimate agreement suffix &quot;-n&quot; followed by the nominalizing particle &quot;-a&quot; (see below), appeared already in Neo-Elamite.

The personal pronouns distinguish nominative and accusative case forms. They are as follows:

In general, no special possessive pronouns are needed in view of the construction with the noun class suffixes. Nevertheless, a set of separate third-person animate possessives &quot;-e&quot; (sing.) / &quot;appi-e&quot; (plur.) is occasionally used already in Middle Elamite: &quot;puhu-e&quot; “her children”, &quot;hiš-api-e&quot; “their name”. The relative pronouns are &quot;akka&quot; “who” and &quot;appa&quot; “what, which”.

===Verbs===

The verb base can be simple (&quot;ta-&quot; “put”) or “reduplicated” (&quot;beti&quot; &gt; &quot;bepti&quot; “rebel”). The pure verb base can function as a verbal noun, or “infinitive”.

The verb distinguishes three forms functioning as finite verbs, known as “conjugations”. Conjugation I is the only one with special endings characteristic of finite verbs as such, as shown below. Its use is mostly associated with active voice, transitivity (or verbs of motion), neutral aspect and past tense meaning. Conjugations II and III can be regarded as periphrastic constructions with participles; they are formed by the addition of the nominal personal class suffixes to a passive perfective participle in &quot;-k&quot; and to an active imperfective participle in &quot;-n&quot;, respectively. Accordingly, conjugation II expresses a perfective aspect, hence usually past tense, and an intransitive or passive voice, whereas conjugation III expresses an imperfective non-past action.

The Middle Elamite conjugation I is formed with the following suffixes:

: Examples: &quot;kulla-h&quot; ”I prayed”, &quot;hap-t&quot; ”you heard”, &quot;hutta-š&quot; “he did”, &quot;kulla-hu&quot; “we prayed”, &quot;hutta-h-t&quot; “you (plur.) did”, &quot;hutta-h-š&quot; “they did”.

In Achaemenid Elamite, the loss of the /h/ reduces the transparency of the Conjugation I endings and leads to the merger of the singular and plural except in the first person; in addition, the first-person plural changes from &quot;-hu&quot; to &quot;-ut&quot;.

The participles can be exemplified as follows: perfective participle &quot;hutta-k&quot; “done”, &quot;kulla-k&quot; “something prayed”, i.e. “a prayer”; imperfective participle &quot;hutta-n&quot; “doing” or “who will do”, also serving as a non-past infinitive. The corresponding conjugations (conjugation II and III) are:

In Achaemenid Elamite, the Conjugation 2 endings are somewhat changed:

There is also a periphrastic construction with an auxiliary verb &quot;ma-&quot; following either Conjugation II and III stems (i.e. the perfective and imperfective participles), or &quot;nomina agentis&quot; in &quot;-r&quot;, or a verb base directly. In Achaemenid Elamite, only the third option exists. There is no consensus on the exact meaning of the periphrastic forms with &quot;ma-&quot;, but durative, intensive or volitional interpretations have been suggested.

The optative is expressed by the addition of the suffix &quot;-ni&quot; to Conjugations I and II. 

The imperative is identical to the second person of Conjugation I in Middle Elamite. In Achaemenid Elamite, it is the third person that coincides with the imperative. 

The prohibitative is formed by the particle &quot;anu/ani&quot; preceding Conjugation III.

Verbal forms can be converted into the heads of subordinate clauses through the addition of the nominalising suffix &quot;-a&quot;, much as in Sumerian: &quot;siyan in-me kuši-hš(i)-me-a&quot; “the temple which they did not build”. &quot;-ti&quot;/&quot;-ta&quot; can be suffixed to verbs, chiefly of conjugation I, expressing possibly a meaning of anteriority (perfect and pluperfect tense).

The negative particle is &quot;in-&quot;; it takes nominal class suffixes that agree with the subject of attention (which may or may not coincide with the grammatical subject): first-person singular &quot;in-ki&quot;, third-person singular animate &quot;in-ri&quot;, third-person singular inanimate &quot;in-ni&quot;/&quot;in-me&quot;. In Achaemenid Elamite, the inanimate form &quot;in-ni&quot; has been generalized to all persons, and concord has been lost.

==Syntax==
Nominal heads are normally followed by their modifiers, but there are occasional inversions. Word order is subject–object–verb (SOV), with indirect objects preceding direct objects, but it becomes more flexible in Achaemenid Elamite. There are often resumptive pronouns before the verb – often long sequences, especially in Middle Elamite (&quot;ap u in duni-h&quot; &quot;to-them I it gave&quot;).

The language uses postpositions such as &quot;-ma&quot; &quot;in&quot; and &quot;-na&quot; &quot;of&quot;, but spatial and temporal relationships are generally expressed in Middle Elamite by means of &quot;directional words&quot; originating as nouns or verbs. They can precede or follow the governed nouns and tend to exhibit noun class agreement with whatever noun is described by the prepositional phrase: &quot;i-r pat-r u-r ta-t-ni&quot; &quot;may you place him under me&quot;, lit. &quot;him inferior of-me place-you-may&quot;. In Achaemenid Elamite, postpositions become more common and partly displace that type of construction. 

A common conjunction is &quot;ak&quot; &quot;and, or&quot;. Achaemenid Elamite also uses a number of subordinating conjunctions such as &quot;anka&quot; &quot;if, when&quot; and &quot;sap&quot; &quot;as, when&quot;. Subordinate clauses usually precede the verb of the main clause. In Middle Elamite, the most common way to construct a relative clause is to attach a nominal class suffix to the clause-final verb, optionally followed by the relativizing suffix &quot;-a&quot;: thus, &quot;lika-me i-r hani-š-r(i)&quot; &quot;whose reign he loves&quot;, or optionally &quot;lika-me i-r hani-š-r-a&quot;. The alternative construction by means of the relative pronouns &quot;akka&quot; &quot;who&quot; and &quot;appa&quot; &quot;which&quot; is uncommon in Middle Elamite, but gradually becomes dominant at the expense of the nominal class suffix construction in Achaemenid Elamite.

Elamite is regarded by the vast majority of linguists as a language isolate, as it has no demonstrable relationship to the neighbouring Semitic languages, Indo-European languages, or to Sumerian, despite having adopted the Sumerian-Akkadian cuneiform script.

An Elamo-Dravidian family connecting Elamite with the Brahui language of Pakistan and Dravidian languages of India was suggested in 1967 by Igor M. Diakonoff and later, in 1974, defended by David McAlpin and others. In 2012, Southworth proposed that Elamite forms the &quot;Zagrosian family&quot; along with Brahui and, further down the cladogram, the remaining Dravidian languages; this family would have originated in Southwest Asia (southern Iran) and was widely distributed in South Asia and parts of eastern West Asia before the Indo-Aryan migration. Recent discoveries regarding early population migration based on ancient DNA analysis have revived interest in the possible connection between proto-Elamite and proto-Dravidian. A critical reassessment of the Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis has been published by Filippo Pedron in 2023.

Václav Blažek proposed a relation with the Semitic languages.

In 2002 George Starostin published a lexicostatistic analysis finding Elamite to be approximately equidistant from Nostratic and Semitic.

None of these ideas have been accepted by mainstream historical linguists.

==History of the study==
The study of Elamite language goes back to the first publications of Achaemenid royal inscriptions in Europe in the first half of the 19th century CE. A great step forward was the publication of the Elamite version of the Bisotun inscription in the name of Darius I, entrusted by Henry Rawlinson to Edwin Norris and appeared in 1855. At that time, Elamite was believed to be Scythic, whose Indoeuropean affiliation was not still established. The first grammar was published by Jules Oppert in 1879. The first to use the glottonym Elamite is considered to be Archibald Henry Sayce in 1874, even if already in 1850 Isidore Löwenstern advanced this identification. The publication of pre-Achaemenid inscriptions from Susa is due along the first three decades of the 20th century by father Vincent Scheil. Then in 1933 the Persepolis Fortification Tablets were discovered, being the first administrative corpus in this language, even if published by Richard T. Hallock much later (1969). Another administrative corpus was discovered in the 1970s at Tall-i Malyan, the ancient city of Anshan, and published in 1984 by Matthew W. Stolper. In the meantime (1967), the Middle Elamite inscriptions from Chogha Zanbil were published by father Marie-Joseph Steve. In the fourth quarter of the 20th century the French school was led by François Vallat, with relevant studies by Françoise Grillot(-Susini) and Florence Malbran-Labat, while the American school of scholars, inaugurated by George G. Cameron and Herbert H. Paper, focused on the administrative corpora with Stolper. Elamite studies have been revived in the 2000s by Wouter F.M. Henkelman with several contributions and a monograph focused on the Persepolis Fortification tablets. Elamite language is currently taught in three universities in Europe, by Henkelman at the École pratique des hautes études, Gian Pietro Basello at the University of Naples &quot;L&#x27;Orientale&quot; and Jan Tavernier at the UCLouvain.

<text>John Rettie &quot;Jock&quot; McKernan Jr. (born May 20, 1948) is an American politician who served two terms as the 71st governor of Maine, from 1987 to 1995.

Born in Bangor, Maine, McKernan attended Dartmouth College and then the University of Maine School of Law. A Republican, McKernan was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives before becoming governor. He also served in the state house from 1973 to 1977 and was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1976 and 1984.

==Early life==
John McKernan was born in Bangor, Maine, on May 20, 1948, the son of Barbara Guild McKernan and John R. McKernan Sr. He was raised in Bangor, where he attended the public schools and graduated from Bangor High School in 1966. After graduating, McKernan attended Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1970.

He then returned to Maine and joined the Maine Army National Guard, in which he served from 1970 until 1973. During this time, he moved to Portland, Maine, to pursue studies at the University of Maine School of Law. He completed his Juris Doctor degree in 1974, while already serving in the Maine House of Representatives.

==Maine House of Representatives==
McKernan&#x27;s first entry into politics was being elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 1972. He did so as one of the youngest ever to serve in that capacity, being only 24 years old.

He was later elected to a second term, where his colleagues selected him as assistant Republican floor leader.

He left the state legislature in 1976 to begin practicing law at a Portland law firm.

==U.S. Representative==
McKernan was twice elected to the United States House of Representatives, in 1982 and 1984.

While he served in the House, he had the unusual distinction of dating the other member of Maine&#x27;s House delegation – Olympia Snowe. The two had met while they had earlier served in the Maine House of Representatives, and began dating in 1978. During their time together in Congress, McKernan and Snowe had nearly identical voting records. Their similar feelings on issues even translated into reversals of opinion – for example, they both switched from opposing aid to the Nicaraguan rebels to later supporting such aid. While their relationship was widely known, it was not reported much by the Maine press.

McKernan retired from Congress to run for governor in 1986, and was sworn in as governor in January 1987.

==Governor of Maine==
===1986 election and first term===
Before the 1986 election, no Republican had occupied the Blaine House in two decades. Incumbent governor Joseph E. Brennan was term limited and could not run again. McKernan immediately declared his intention to run for governor, and Brennan declared his candidacy for McKernan&#x27;s old congressional seat in the first district (which he would eventually win).

McKernan&#x27;s opponent was James E. Tierney, former Majority Leader of the Maine House and state Attorney General – though he did also face two independent candidates, Sherry Huber and John Menario. He based his campaign on better schools and better jobs, believing them to be the keys to making Maine (in his words) &quot;the very best place in America to live, to work and to raise a family.&quot; He pledged to pursue both goals without a major tax increase. Additionally, he focused on economic development, claiming that Maine could become what he dubbed &quot;the opportunity state&quot;. After a spirited campaign, McKernan emerged on top, besting Tierney by a nine-point margin. However, McKernan received only 39% of the vote in a divided four-way race.

McKernan, just 38 years old on inauguration day, was welcomed with a $46-million surplus. That good financial news would be short-lived, however, as the state would face a number of fiscal challenges in the coming years.

In his first tenure in Augusta, McKernan attempted to grow the Maine economy. He helped initiate a $1.35-million fund to create &quot;centers of innovation,&quot; designed to position Maine at the cutting edge of the next technological change. He also worked to expand job training programs, structured to enable the state to quickly change the skills being taught to meet the needs of a new employer. An additional $5.9-million state investment in the University of Maine System was also spearheaded by the governor, intended to enhance its educational and research reputation. These efforts were hammered home with the governor&#x27;s new economic development slogan: &quot;MAINE: We&#x27;re America&#x27;s Future Business.&quot; The program created &quot;opportunity zones&quot; throughout the state to draw jobs to areas in need of new or additional industry.

In his second year in office, Governor McKernan launched a public-relations campaign intended to enhance the state&#x27;s image as a place to do business.

For all the work to develop Maine&#x27;s economy, McKernan also faced a number of difficulties which stunted his efforts. Budget shortfalls began to run rampant toward the end of his term, and legislative battles with opposition Democrats became frequent. The relationship between longtime Speaker of the House John L. Martin and McKernan was poisonous, and the two had difficulty resolving differences over the state budget. The Governor crafted a plan to eliminate or reduce welfare and job-training benefits for thousands of low-income Mainers, while Martin and the Democrats fought to keep funding at a higher level.

The difficult budget fights between the governor and the legislature would prove to be a major issue in McKernan&#x27;s effort to be re-elected.

===1990 election and second term===

During his announcement for his re-election campaign, McKernan listed as important successes a growth management initiative, a trash reduction and recycling program, and a plan to remove the Kennebec River dam in Augusta by the end of the 1990s. McKernan credited his administration with taking decisive action against illegal drugs, citing the creation of the Bureau of Intergovernmental Drug Enforcement. Troubled by difficult financial issues, McKernan reiterated his claim that Maine had responded to budget difficulties with less impact on taxpayers than other states in the New England region. He pointed out that Maine was the only state in the Northeast that had a balanced budget and that had done it without raising taxes.
Polling in May 1990 showed former governor Joseph Brennan with a 9-point lead over the incumbent governor. McKernan felt that the erosion of his support occurred during the legislative budget battles, and would be reversed in the months before the election, believing that the situation would improve as the state budget continued to hold further into the fiscal year.

The race was so close that the candidates waited until shortly before noon the following day before summoning reporters to make acceptance and concession remarks. Brennan acknowledged that voter margins in his traditional strongholds in southern Maine weren&#x27;t enough to offset McKernan&#x27;s strength in rural and northern Maine.

McKernan has characterized his narrow victory as something of a comeback, considering that pollsters showed him 12 points behind Brennan only two months prior. Momentum began to change only in mid-October, McKernan said, when his campaign was able to effectively communicate &quot;not only what we had accomplished but also what was at stake in this election.&quot; Brennan said that he saw no fatal flaws in his campaign, but added he was hurt by the long federal budget debate that kept him in Washington when he needed to be campaigning in Maine. &quot;It hurts the dynamic of the campaign when you can&#x27;t be here,&quot; he explained.

McKernan&#x27;s second term became defined by partisan battles with the state legislature&#x27;s Democratic majority over fiscal management, given a large budget deficit and a constitution that prohibited borrowing to offset budget gaps. He threatened to invoke a 1976 law permitting the governor to make &quot;fair and equitable&quot; spending reductions to comply with the state&#x27;s balanced-budget mandate. His specific controversial actions included drafting plans to cut spending unilaterally and rewriting rules to give state agencies more discretion in how they allocate their reduced funds. Democrats objected and took McKernan to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, but the court upheld the governor&#x27;s authority to take such action.

McKernan also battled with Democrats about state&#x27;s workmen&#x27;s compensation costs, eventually settling with them for a roughly 26% decrease in spending.

==Legacy in Maine==
When participating in a forum after his governorship was over, McKernan spoke at length about a number of things he felt were successes in his tenure, as well as his own personal disappointments.

According to McKernan, his most prominent milestone was preparing the state for a global economy. He made note that during his stewardship, Maine competed not just with other states, but globally in such countries as Malaysia and Hong Kong. He also mentioned enhancing the state&#x27;s business climate and workers-compensation reforms as significant achievements.

At the same time, he stated that while he was governor, Maine was at the &quot;highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows,&quot; economically. He felt that this unpredictability prevented him from being able to forecast a dramatic downturn in state revenues toward the latter part of his time in office, and said that it was his biggest lament.

McKernan&#x27;s legacy is conflicted. His political party never controlled either branch of the state legislature, so his administration became defined by bitter battles between the Blaine House and the State House. McKernan and the Democratic leadership (particularly John Martin) fostered an extremely hostile and adversarial climate that consumed almost every aspect of Maine government in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The wounds of those conflicts still run deep to this day, as McKernan has made repeated references to the scarred relationship between the two men since leaving office.

==Post-government life==
*Honorary state chairman for John McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign in Maine.
*Served as outside director of ImmuCell Corporation since 1995.
*He became chief executive officer of Education Management Corporation, the parent company of several for-profit colleges, on September 1, 2003, where he served until 2006. He subsequently served as executive chairman.

==Personal life and family==
McKernan has been married twice. His first marriage was to Judith Files. They had one child together, Peter McKernan, but the couple subsequently divorced in 1978. On January 23, 1991, Peter died of a previously undetected heart problem after lying in a coma for nine days. He had collapsed during baseball practice at Dartmouth College. He was 20 years old at the time, played junior varsity baseball at Dartmouth and had recently joined the school&#x27;s Beta Theta Pi fraternity.

In 1989, McKernan married eventual U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe after the two had been dating for roughly six years. McKernan and Snowe met while serving in the Maine House of Representatives and again served together in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 1987.

<text>Lituya Bay (; Tlingit: &quot;Ltu.aa&quot;, meaning &#x27;lake within the point&#x27;) is a fjord located on the coast of the south-east part of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is long and wide at its widest point. The bay was noted in 1786 by Jean-François de Lapérouse, who named it Port des Français. Twenty-one of his men perished in the tidal current in the bay.

==Description==

The smaller Cascade and Crillon glaciers and the larger Lituya Glacier all spill into Lituya Bay, which is a part of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Cenotaph Island is located roughly in the middle of the bay. The entrance of the bay is approximately wide, with a narrow navigable channel.

The bay is known for its tremendous size tides, which have a range of approximately . Tidal currents in the entrance reach . The entrance is considered dangerous to navigation, especially when the tidal currents are running, but the interior of the bay provides good protection to anchored ships.

Lituya Bay is also famous for four recorded tsunamis, in 1854, 1899, 1936, and 1958.

The bay is mentioned in Jack London&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Unexpected&quot;. (In that story, the name of the bay is spelled &quot;Latuya&quot;.)

==1958 megatsunami==

The same topography that leads to the heavy tidal currents also created the tsunami with the highest runup against a hillside in recorded history. On the night of July 9, 1958, an earthquake caused a landslide in the Gilbert Inlet at the head of the bay, generating a massive megatsunami which had sufficient energy to run up the hill slope just opposite of the landslide to a height measuring , taller than the Empire State Building. There were three fishing boats anchored near the entrance of Lituya Bay on the day the giant wave occurred. One boat (the &quot;Sunmore&quot;) was sunk by the wave and debris as it attempted to exit the bay, and the two people on board (a married couple, the Wagners) were killed. The second boat (the &quot;Badger&quot;) was carried across the la Chasseuse, spit into the ocean, hit by a floating log and sunk but not before its occupants (a married couple, the Swansons) in spite of injuries, managed to board a skiff ultimately to be rescued. The third boat, the &quot;Edrie&quot;, crewed by father and son the Ulriches, was anchored at the opposite side of the bay entrance. The father, Howard, turned the boat to face the wave, which picked her up, snapped her anchor chain, carried her above the trees but then washed her back into the bay with no major damage. William A. Swanson and Howard G. Ulrich provided accounts of what they observed. Based on Swanson&#x27;s description of the length of time it took the wave to reach his boat after overtopping Cenotaph Island near the bay&#x27;s entrance, the wave may have been traveling . When it reached the open sea, however, it dissipated quickly. This incident was the first direct evidence and eyewitness report of the existence of megatsunamis.

<doc id="496459" wikidata="Q1172599" url="?curid=496459" title="Inlet">
<text>An inlet is a (usually long and narrow) indentation of a shoreline, such as a small arm, cove, bay, sound, fjord, lagoon or marsh, that leads to an enclosed larger body of water such as a lake, estuary, gulf or marginal sea.

==Overview==

In marine geography, the term &quot;inlet&quot; usually refers to either the actual channel between an enclosed bay and the open ocean and is often called an &quot;entrance&quot;, or a significant recession in the shore of a sea, lake or large river. A certain kind of inlet created by past glaciation is a fjord, typically but not always in mountainous coastlines and also in montane lakes.

Multi-arm complexes of large inlets or fjords may be called sounds, e.g., Puget Sound, Howe Sound, Karmsund (&quot;sund&quot; is Scandinavian for &quot;sound&quot;). Some fjord-type inlets are called canals, e.g., Portland Canal, Lynn Canal, Hood Canal, and some are channels, e.g., Dean Channel and Douglas Channel.

Tidal amplitude, wave intensity, and wave direction are all factors that influence sediment flux in inlets.

On low slope sandy coastlines, inlets often separate barrier islands and can form as the result of storm events. Alongshore sediment transport can cause inlets to close if the action of tidal currents flowing through an inlet do not flush accumulated sediment out of the inlet.

<doc id="496463" wikidata="Q1447954" url="?curid=496463" title="Recipe for Hate">
<text>Recipe for Hate is the seventh studio album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on June 4, 1993. It was their last album on Epitaph Records for nine years (until 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Process of Belief&quot;) and the band had switched to Atlantic Records, who re-released the album several months after its release.

While the album was reissued on a major label, &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; initially received mixed reviews from music critics. It was also the first Bad Religion album to chart in the U.S., debuting at number 14 on Billboard&#x27;s Heatseekers chart, with &quot;American Jesus&quot; and &quot;Struck a Nerve&quot; in particular released as singles.

==Production==
Like Bad Religion&#x27;s albums up to &quot;Generator&quot;, &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; was recorded at Westbeach Recorders in Hollywood, California, in 1993. This was the last time they would record an album there, until 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Process of Belief&quot;.

During the recording of the album, Johnette Napolitano (of Concrete Blonde) and Eddie Vedder (of Pearl Jam) were invited to the studio to provide backing vocals on some of the songs. Napolitano&#x27;s backing vocals can be heard on &quot;Struck a Nerve&quot;, where she provides backing vocals on the bridge and the final chorus. Vedder also provided backing vocals on &quot;American Jesus&quot; and sings the second verse of &quot;Watch It Die&quot;.

Final overdubs and mixing were done at Brooklyn Recording Studios in Los Angeles, CA. The car used in &quot;Stealth&quot; was Brett Gurewitz&#x27;s car, and recorded just outside the studio in the parking lot. One or two songs were remixed at a different studio after the Brooklyn Recording sessions.

==Musical style==
The album finds Bad Religion continuing the experimentation of its predecessor, &quot;Generator&quot;, introducing elements of country and folk on songs like &quot;Man with a Mission&quot;, and &quot;Struck a Nerve&quot;, the latter of which includes a guest vocal by Johnette Napolitano (of Concrete Blonde). &quot;Man with a Mission&quot; featured a slide guitar part over a standard punk guitar &quot;gallop&quot;. Drummer Bobby Schayer referred to it as Bad Religion&#x27;s iteration of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967) by the Beatles. Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote that the album &quot;continu[es] to intellectually question America&#x27;s blind view of itself and the rest of the world.&quot;

==Album cover==

The album cover features an image of two dog-faced humans. It is an original photo collage – using the bodies of 1930s Southern racists mocking the press after their acquittal by an all-white jury for murder, and 1944 Nazi Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp guard dog heads. The artwork was designed by Fred Hidalgo (known for drawing the cover for the Offspring&#x27;s highly acclaimed 1994 album &quot;Smash&quot;, which was also released on Epitaph). &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; was the first Bad Religion album since 1988&#x27;s &quot;Suffer&quot; to display the Friz Quadrata font on the cover; the band would use this font again on their subsequent albums (except for &quot;The Process of Belief&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot;).

==Release and reception==
&quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; was released on June 4, 1993, and became the last Bad Religion album distributed via Epitaph Records before their return to the label in 2001. Although &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it peaked at number 14 on Billboard&#x27;s Heatseekers chart. The singles &quot;American Jesus&quot; and &quot;Struck a Nerve&quot; also did not chart, but earned airplay on MTV. Viewed as their breakthrough album, it would sell close to 200,000 copies. They subsequently signed to major label Atlantic Records, who reissued the album on 6 September 1993. The band was taking up resources at Epitaph Records, much to the disadvantage of the other acts on the label. Thompson wrote that &quot;it is no coincidence that no sooner was the label free to deal with acts other than Bad Religion that both the Offspring and Rancid commenced their own dizzying ascents.&quot;

&quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; received generally mixed to positive reviews from most music critics. Allmusic reviewer Jack Rabid gave the album a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five and states: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to take them for granted, to view &quot;Recipe&quot; as just another red-hot LP (ho hum) by the last and best band to survive the &#x27;80s L.A. punk explosion. And on first listen, it&#x27;s tarnished by their previous mild malaise: everything sounds alike, and some exit the boat here too quickly. But then the beautiful sonic smack starts to sink in, and the luxurious melodies introduce erudite parables.&quot; Thompson thought that the band &quot;wrap themselves in some of their strongest songs ever&quot;, adding that it was an &quot;obvious next step on from &quot;Generator&quot;, a little bit cleaner, a tiny taste brighter, and a major league breakthrough which deserved every plaudit.&quot;

Unlike Bad Religion&#x27;s previous albums (except &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;), &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; has never been remastered, or reissued on CD or cassette since Atlantic re-released the album in 1993. It has, however, been reissued on vinyl twice (in 2009 and 2015), and was included in the 2010 vinyl box set &quot;30 Years of Bad Religion&quot;, containing reissues of all the band&#x27;s albums up to &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot;.

<text>Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is a U.S. national lakeshore in the northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Located within Benzie and Leelanau counties, the park extends along a stretch of Lake Michigan&#x27;s eastern coastline, as well as North and South Manitou islands, preserving a total of . The park is known for its outstanding natural features, including dune formations, forests, beaches, and ancient glacial phenomena. The lakeshore also contains many cultural features, including the 1871 South Manitou Island Lighthouse, three former stations of the Coast Guard (formerly the Life-Saving Service), and an extensive rural historic farm district. 

The park is administered by the National Park Service, and was established on October 21, 1970. In 2011, the area won the title of &quot;The Most Beautiful Place in America&quot; from Good Morning America. In 2014, a section of the park was named the [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act|Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness]] by the United States Congress.

== Geography ==

The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore protects of the shoreline of Lake Michigan. Much of this area is located on the Leelanau Peninsula, a large peninsula in the northwest of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula. The park is located about west of Traverse City, the largest city in Northern Michigan.

The southern end of the park is located within northwestern Benzie County, and includes the shoreline of Platte Bay and the mouth of the Platte River. This area of the park is much flatter than the northern sections, within southwestern Leelanau County. The Leelanau County sections of the park include the dune climb, Empire Bluff, Pyramid Point, and Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive. Much of the park within Leelanau County is located adjacent to Glen Lake, Michigan&#x27;s 18th largest lake.

Administered by the park are North Manitou Island and South Manitou Island. These islands are accessible by ferry access from Leland.

Within the park run scenic highways M-22 and M-109. The M-22 shield has become such a popular cultural symbol to visitors of the area that a company based out of Traverse City began selling merchandise with the symbol in 2004.

=== Local communities ===
The nearest communities to the national lakeshore are Empire and Glen Arbor. Empire is home to the Philip A. Hart Visitor Center, which serves as the park&#x27;s headquarters.

=== Municipalities within protected area ===
The following municipalities contained land administered by the National Park Service:

Benzie County

* Benzonia Township
* Lake Township
* Platte Township

Leelanau County

* Centerville Township
* Cleveland Township
* Empire Township
* Glen Arbor Township
* Kasson Township
* Leland Township

==History==

=== Prehistory ===

The landscape within the park was formed during the Wisconsin glaciation during the Last Glacial Period, approximately 10,000-14,000 years ago. The dunes themselves are not a true dune, but a perched dune, a thin layer of wind-blown sand perched upon a large deposit of glacial debris. Over time, the dunes have slowly migrated eastward.

=== Recent history ===
In 1962, Senator Philip Hart first introduced a bill to create Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park. The park finally was authorized on October 21, 1970. The park&#x27;s creation was controversial because it involved the transfer of private property to public ownership. The federal government&#x27;s stance at the time was that the Great Lakes were the &quot;third coast&quot; and had to be preserved much like Cape Hatteras National Seashore or Point Reyes National Seashore. The residents living in what is now Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore believed themselves stewards of the land and did not want it to be overrun by tourists. The government eventually won out, in part by supporting the local schools to offset the lost property tax revenue and by including North Manitou Island in the national lakeshore area.

In 2014, of the park were formally designated as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness by the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act. This was the first wilderness protection bill to be passed by the United States Congress in five years.

In 2022, a man from Frankfort illegally diverted the mouth of the Platte River, allowing the river to meet Lake Michigan at a more direct angle. Charges were filed against the man in 2023.

=== Etymology ===
The park is named after an Ojibwe legend of the sleeping bear. According to the legend, an enormous forest fire on the western shore of Lake Michigan drove a mother bear and her two cubs into the lake for shelter, determined to reach the opposite shore. After many miles of swimming, the two cubs lagged. When the mother bear reached the shore, she waited on the top of a high bluff. The exhausted cubs drowned in the lake, but the mother bear stayed and waited, hoping that her cubs would finally appear. Impressed by the mother bear&#x27;s determination and faith, the Great Spirit created two islands (North and South Manitou islands) to commemorate the cubs, and the winds buried the sleeping bear under the sands of the dunes where she waits to this day. The &quot;bear&quot; was a small tree-covered knoll at the top edge of the bluff that appeared like a sleeping bear from the water. Wind and erosion have caused the &quot;bear&quot; to be greatly reduced in size over the years.

== Recreation ==

=== Dune climb ===

The main dune climb is located across from Glen Lake. Visitors who travel by car will be required to buy a day pass or annual pass from the National Park Service. The dune climb is also accessible by foot or by bike. Water stations are located along the base of the main dune, along with a restroom and gift shop. Hikers can hike all the way to Lake Michigan.
=== Camping ===
Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is one of Michigan&#x27;s most popular destinations for camping vacations, possibly the most popular. This popularity may be due to the fact it was named the &quot;Most Beautiful Place in America&quot; by Good Morning America in 2011. There are a few campgrounds in the national lakeshore and they are grouped into D.H. Day Campground, Platte River Campground, a few camping areas on the Manitou Islands within, and some other sites for backcountry or group camping. These include:

* &quot;D.H. Day Campground&quot; – located between Glen Arbor and Glen Haven, D.H. Day Campground offers a moderate level of privacy and a beach on Lake Michigan. Campsites are rustic, wooded, and more far apart than campsites at most campgrounds. Nearby points of interest include Empire Bluffs, the &quot;dune climb&quot;, and North Bar Lake. Campsites 1–31 allow the use of a generator, the remaining sites forbid generator use.
* &quot;Platte River Campground&quot; – located in Benzie County and offers a variety of campsites. Some campsites are modern (with electrical hookups), some are &quot;hike-in,&quot; and others are more rustic. Nearby points of interest include Platte River Point, the Platte River, and Big Platte Lake. The north section of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park is a short drive from Platte River Campground. Kayaking is a popular activity at the campground, especially the kayak trail leading from the campground to Platte River Point

Additionally, a number of campgrounds exist on the Manitou Islands. These include three main campgrounds on South Manitou Island, including the Weather Station Campground located on the south side of the island, the Bay Campground on the west shore of the island and the Popple Campground on the north shore. Furthermore, in addition to federal campgrounds within the national lakeshore itself, there are many other camping areas nearby, which cater to the large number of tourists visiting Sleeping Bear Dunes each year. There are at least 20 distinct camping areas in the region immediately surrounding Sleeping Bear Dunes.

=== Hiking ===

Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore offers a number of hiking trails. These include but are not limited to the Alligator Hill Trail, Empire Bluff Trail, Kettles Trail, Pyramid Point Trail, and Treat Farm Trail. Empire Bluff Trail is one of the most popular hiking destinations in the park. Hikers will need to get a parking pass from the visitor center in Empire to park in the lot at the trailheads.

=== Historic sites ===

==== Glen Haven Village ====
Glen Haven existed as a company town from 1865 to 1931. Originally a dock for Glen Arbor (1855-date), the site soon became a fuel supply point for ships traveling up and down the lake. Here, Charles McCarty decided to open his own business and built a dock to supply the ships with wood. In 1863, McCarty built the Sleeping Bear House. It was expanded a few years later to accommodate travelers. In 1928, it was remodeled into the inn for summer vacationers. The General Store was established to supply the workers. Like most company towns, the workers were paid in company coupons, redeemable only at the company store. The Blacksmith Shop is where tools were repaired. In 1878, David Henry Day arrived in the community. By this time, coal from the Appalachian coal fields was replacing wood on the steamships, and Day was looking for another future in this small community.

==== Port Oneida Historic Farm District ====

In 1860, Port Oneida had a population of 87 people. Thomas Kelderhouse had built a dock to sell wood to the passing steamships. He was also able to sell fresh produce and maple sugar in season. A local story says that the name comes from the first ship to stop, the SS &quot;Oneida&quot; of New York state. The area covers and includes 16 historic farms. The farming community was gradually abandoned due to hard farming conditions and declining timber sales.
=== Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive ===

Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is a scenic road within the park, known for its &quot;scenic vistas and gentle curves&quot;. Located off of M-109 between Empire and Glen Haven, the road runs , providing access to scenic views of Lake Michigan, Glen Lake, and surrounding parkland.

=== Kayaking ===

Kayaking is a popular activity in the park&#x27;s rivers and lakes, especially in the Crystal River and Platte River.

<doc id="496471" wikidata="Q7834758" url="?curid=496471" title="Transpacific Route Case">
<text>The Transpacific Route Case was a major administrative law case argued before the Civil Aeronautics Board for much of the 1960s. Before the case, the only U.S. airlines permitted to fly transpacific routes were Pan Am and Northwest Orient. Continental Airlines also flew transpacific routes on military contract, but was not allowed to carry civilians.

President Dwight Eisenhower opened the case in 1959 in order to investigate opening the market up to further competition, but he closed the case shortly before leaving office. John F. Kennedy reopened the case in 1961.

The CAB concluded the case in 1969, retaining Northwest and Pan Am&#x27;s routes to Asia and making the following additional route awards:

* American Airlines - Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, New Zealand, Samoa
* Continental Airlines - Guam, Hawaii, Saipan
* Northwest Airlines - Hawaii to Asia flights
* Trans World Airlines - Hawaii, Japan, Taiwan
* Western Airlines - Hawaii

The award was a great victory for TWA, which had already established service from the U.S. to Europe, connecting onward as far east as Hong Kong. The case gave TWA a &quot;round the world route&quot; and allowed it to serve South and Southeast Asia in both westbound and eastbound directions. Initially, Continental Airlines was awarded routes to Australia and New Zealand with stops. However, President Nixon, upon taking office set aside the international route awards. The rights previously given to Continental Airlines were later given to American Airlines.

One loser in the case was American, which had petitioned long and hard for rights to serve Japan: it did not want the South Pacific routes, and it ended up trading those routes to Pan Am. United Airlines was the biggest loser of all: it received no transpacific routes, besides some Hawaiian routes that were added in the early 1960s.

<text>A  (, &#x27;plainsman&#x27;) is a Venezuelan and Colombian herder. The name is taken from the Llanos grasslands occupying eastern Colombia and western-central Venezuela.

During the Spanish American wars of independence, lancers and cavalry served in both armies and provided the bulk of the cavalry during the war. They were known for being skilled riders who were in charge of all the tasks related to livestock and other ranch-related activities. The historical figure emerged in the 17th century until its disappearance at the end of the 19th century, with the Andean hegemony and the birth of the Venezuelan oil industry.

Its ethnic origin dates back to the union of the Arawaks, Andalusians, Canarians and to a lesser extent the slaves brought by The Crown during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The way of working and being comes from the current Apure and Barinas states of the Venezuelans who adapted and modified Andalusian customs, and then exported them to the New Kingdom of Granada. Thanks to their mannerisms, ethnic origin, dialect, culture, and role in the Spanish American Wars of Independence, Venezuelan civil wars and in Montoneras it has been romanticized and idealized and become the Venezuelan national hero and mythos.

== First settlements ==
 In the 16th century, the first herd was introduced about twenty-five leagues from the city of Calabozo by Cristóbal Rodríguez along with eleven families from El Tocuyo. He founded the town that he called San Luis de la Unión. From there the plains began to populate thanks to the mares and foals brought from the New Kingdom of Granada and the different Andalusian families from Seville, Almería, Granada, Cádiz, Jaén and Córdoba.

By the middle of the 17th century there were some 137,800 cattle in the most important &quot;hatos&quot;. The natives of the region, that is to say, the Achaguas, the Yaguales, the Arichunas and Caquetíos (Arawak family) were already almost destroyed by a war that lasted eighty years before the conquest, so that evangelization and its eventual miscegenation was given without much trouble. The indigenous component in the region was quite predominant, but today, it does not represent a third. For the 16th century the Spanish Crown prohibited amerindians, blacks or creole whites from riding an equine since it was only a privilege for the peninsular, however, the economy expanded to such an extent that they had to promote legal reforms so that the excluded classes may have this privilege in the short term.

Between 1640 and 1790 the black maroons lived in &quot;cumbes&quot;, a society of maroons. These ended up mixing with the over the years.

In the 18th century, the Cabildo de Santiago de León de Caracas issued the first law regulating the abuse of large hatcheries on the plain. From this date, the &quot;cuatreros&quot; who stole the cattle of the plains emerged, characterized by being armed robberies.

At the end of the 18th century, the region exported 30,000 mules a year to the Antilles and sacrificed meat for the 1.5 million slaves there and in Cuba. There were 1.2 million head of cattle in the area before 1815. Between 1916 - 1917 Bolívar Coronado indicates that 

== The ==


In the beginning, these riders lived in a semi-nomadic way, being hired by different herds to carry out their tasks; in these journeys there was always a cook, a doctor, and a physician apart from the team of &quot;cabresteros&quot; and &quot;baquianos&quot;. They practiced fishing, hunting, bartering, and trading with each other. Due to the hostile flora and fauna of the plain, these adapted to combat it, so it was frequent the taming of alligators, bulls and pimps with their different utensils such as rope and knife. Tall in stature, lean bodies and strong muscles, adapted to the tropical climate. According to Ramón Páez, the llanero had several physical characteristics that resembled the Arabic one. Bolívar Coronado said Always on horseback, sober, haughty and extremely manly. Black coffee drinker and chewer, a kind of tobacco. The llanero did both the male and female tasks. The great terrain of the plain forced them to be versatile when working so we have not only the , but the cheese makers, saddlers, and , each of them doing tasks that would be considered feminine for the time.His way of riding a horse is different from that of his American companions. Ramón Páez in his book Wild Scenes in South America; or Life in the Venezuelan Llanos makes two observations about the way of riding of these riders 

== Participation in the wars of independence ==

At the beginning of the independence process, the plains were an indispensable region due to its rich livestock and agricultural resources, and for having above all many strong, fast, disciplined riders, accustomed to a harsh environment. 

The plains (as the Andes), due to its difficulty of transportation, were an abandoned area compared to the others in the Captaincy General of Venezuela, this caused its inhabitants to develop their own way of life apart from the rest of the population, with their own codes, but it was also a canton with many qualities that would be used by the different Caudillos on duty to raise montoneras.

The lion of the Llanos, José Tomás Boves, taking advantage of the precarious situation of the peons of the field of the plain, made a large part of the llaneros join the Royalist Army, under the idea of the exploitation of the &quot;Mantuanos&quot; towards the llaneros. The main causes of the union of the llaneros with Boves was the repression made by the republicans towards them, the capture of black maroons who had escaped in the skirmish of the First Republic, the recruited peons and slaves, among others. All this had as a reaction a complete rejection in this land towards the republic. 

Boves, under a pirate flag as the main banner and a montonera made up mainly of lancers, started his participation in the dissolution of the Second Republic.  Participating in different campaigns and battles such as the Campaign of the Valleys of Aragua and El Tuy, the Second Battle de la Puerta, the Siege of Valencia and the emigration to the East until achieving the dissolution of the Second Republic and commanding its own militia made up of thousands of llaneros.

The fall of the Second Republic brought with it several consequences for the population. Several of the promises made to the llaneros were not kept. Various charges were removed from different pardos and llaneros that were decorated by Boves and Monteverde. The prohibition of looting, and the fear of losing autonomy in their regions by the royalists led several troops to desert the Royalist Army. In some regions the war was constant for five, ten or even fifteen years and the only authority that could be used for protection during and after the conflict was the Caudillo whose dominion was thus legitimized; that is why after independence a stage of wars between rival chiefs was ready. As the Portuguese Joaquim Pedro de Oliveira Martins (1845-1894) said about the Iberian devotio

Neither Boves nor Morillo managed to achieve the dominance of the llaneros, they were men like General José Antonio Páez, Manuel Cedeño, José Gregorio Monagas, José Antonio Anzoátegui, Francisco de Paula Santander, Ramón Nonato Pérez, Juan Ángel Bravo, Juan Mellado, Manuel Camacaro, Juan Nepomuceno Moreno and the Liberator Simón Bolívar (the Llaneros called him &quot;culo de hierro&quot; – or &quot;iron buttocks&quot; – for his endurance on horseback). Those who in the end would get the llanero&#x27;s sympathy for their cause.

Páez, &quot;el centauro de los Llanos&quot;, the clarified citizen or the Taita was a man of the people, of humble and Canarian origin but above all llanero; Raised as one to become an excellent spearman, &quot;cabrestero&quot;, &quot;baquiano&quot; and leader, he made an image in the plain until he became &quot;caporal&quot;. The precarious situation of the plain and its inhabitants led to his companions persuading him to enter the &quot;Ejercito libertador&quot;. Due to his character and being someone for and for the people, it was not difficult for him to raise people in arms, reaching not only to command his own montonera, but to an entire country. Becoming not only the first Llanero president of Venezuela, but also one of the few cowboy presidents that history has seen. Contrary to Boves, Páez did not raise the llaneros based on their hatred, but based on their needs, first freeing them from Spanish rule and then the future Bogotá oligarchy. Bolívar Coronado points out that

The Braves of Apure or the Páez lancers, an army of llaneros made up of all classes, including the Negro Primero, a black maroon turned llanero of great caliber, were crucial in several battles, such as that of Las Queseras del Medio, in which 153 Paez llaneros lancers under the tactic &quot;Vuelvan Caras&quot; defeated with only 2 deaths 1,200 Spanish riders, giving a quantity of 400 casualties to the royalist side. The llaneros were also of vital importance in the campaigns of Urica, Swamp of Vargas, Boyacá, the batlle of Junín, the battle of Ayacucho and Carabobo, which were decisive for the republican side.

== Journey to the old llano ==
Llanero are divided into four types: the Cabrestero, the Baquiano, the Cuatrero and the Musician.

* Cabrestero: rider who leads the cattle by means of the halters.
* Baquiano: rider who knows the ways, shortcuts, language, and customs of a region. It acts as a guide to travel through them.
* Cuatrero: rider thief of herds or cattle.
* Musician: rider, composer, and singer of the plain. He usually plays either the cuatro, harp, maraca, bandola, or violin.

The large crossings between herds to transport livestock are extremely rigorous and demanding. These &quot;cabresteros&quot; and &quot;baquianos&quot; guide thousands or hundreds of cattle through the immense plains because the railroad had not yet been introduced in that region (they still do not have a railroad). Each beef being marked according to the membership herd. Thanks to Bolívar Coronado we have several brands of cattle belonging to various herds of the 18th century, such as those of Evangelina López and Pedro Fraile. The cattle were not in bars, so the only way to differentiate them was with the brand. To mark the ear, the llaneros used the so-called fork, with various shapes. One of them was to slit the ear of the cattle in several ways.

These caravans, which are very reminiscent of the eastern one, were commanded by the cabrestero, among them and of equal importance, was the cook, the doctor, a physicist, and obviously the different cowboys and baquianos. Unlike cattle in North America or Europe, that of the plains was not accustomed to human contact due to not being wired, which made the herding more complicated. If a large river blocks their way, they have to guide the herd and the cattle to pass this current; the bonguero, with his bongo -type of canoe- transported the merchandise and some llaneros. The cowboys and the cabrestero sank into the water and led the cattle and beasts through the stream. Always taking care of the deadly piranhas and alligators that inhabit these waters, thanks to the stampedes, they usually did not approach these transfers, but from time to time an alligator was seen blocking the path, so the llaneros, armed with a knife and his falseta, had to sank underwater to catch the alligator and get it out of the way. If the piranhas reached these waters, the only option was to escape as quickly as possible, due to how fierce and dangerous they are. This river crossing took several hours. At the end of the day, after eating, they took out their hammocks and put them on the available palm trees or trees, where these cowboys could rest quietly. If there were no logs nearby, they used the blanket and hammock for a kind of makeshift bed. If they had the opportunity and the fortune to find a pulpería -kind of hotel and groceries store-, they rested in those facilities thanks to the kindness of their owners. The quality of the pulperías or &quot;hato&quot; varied a lot, going from some quite gloomy or others quite adapted to the tasks of the field.

== Creatures of the plains ==
=== Venezuelan creole horse ===
Due to the great biodiversity of the plain, we have a large number of animals and flora that make this environment quite exotic and unique for dressage. The ranch and cattle are left free and grow in the field, until they reach the right age to be domesticated.

Each horse or &quot;padrote&quot; has a particular name that distinguishes it from the rest and shows the owner&#x27;s affection towards it. Here are some: Lancero, Banderita, Guapetón, Corozo, Esmeralda, Cacique, Pluza de Garza, Bayoneta, Lucero, Torito, Bellaco, Caney, among others.

For the llanero, the horse is par excellence a beast. Other animals are not beasts for the llanero. Like cattle, it is only beef. Pigs are herds.

For their dressage, a team of llaneros armed with lassos, they scurry and strongly immobilize the legs of the stallion with their lassos, another llanero arrives and rides on top of the beast, cuts off part of the mane to show that it has been tamed and grabs what remains, the ranger gives the Order and the others remove their lassos, the beast, being accustomed to the freedom of the plain, will try with all its might to take off the tamer, kicking and with several jumps, until in the end, the beast is defeated, and is tamed by the llanero.

The horse is the llanero&#x27;s best friend, so much so that they even have poems like these
=== Animals ===
Alligators, caribs, babas, eels, wild pigs, bulls and jaguars are animals native to the region. The alligator was hunted as a game and also for being an obstacle, usually with the falseta it is immobilized, but its skin, being so hard and resistant, it has to be nailed with the knife at specific points such as under the legs. Eels, capable of killing a stallion, are a real danger, the hunting method is to use a horse as a hook, when passing through the river, the horse would be attacked by the eels until it was immobilized. Upon revealing their position, the llaneros would hunt them down, and the other eels flee the field to make way for the riders and cattle, and the horse recovers instantly, with no repercussions from the incident.

== Bahareque ==

Bahareque is the general name given to the construction system of certain types of houses in Colombia and Venezuela. The bahareques have generally been the type of dwelling for the llanero. The roof is casupo, a long leaf that is placed superimposed like tiles and is tied with a . Those leaves are dried and toasted by the sun, it is a totally waterproof and cool roof. Its bahareque walls are made by opening a hole in the ground and there is a lot of wet mud put in it, a lot of straw cut into small pieces is added to it and a few men get into the hole to step on the mud until it is well mixed. Previously a frame is made with sticks and verada. For the walls, the mud is thrown until filling the spaces of the frame. The bahareque is very cool, it is ideal for the climate of the plain. Its patterns always follow rectangular shapes; It is also used for internal furniture, made entirely from the materials available on site. The external branches attached to the bahareque are called caney.

==Llanero culture==
Cattle form an important part of Llanero culture. There are 12 million cattle on the llano. During the year, the Llaneros have to drive cattle great distances. During the winter wet season, the Llaneros have to drive the cattle to higher ground as the poor drainage of the plains means that the annual floods are extensive. Conversely, they have to drive the cattle towards wet areas during the dry summer.

The Llaneros show their skills in coleo competitions, similar to rodeos, where they compete to drag cattle to the ground.

Llanero music is distinctive for its use of the harp, the maracas and a small guitar called a cuatro. The joropo, a Llanero dance, has become the national dance of Venezuela, and of the Llanos of Colombia. While Llanero music is relatively unknown outside of Colombia and Venezuela, the musical groups Los Llaneros and Cimarrón have toured throughout the world.

Llanero cuisine is based on meat, fish, chicken, meat (also known as capybara), rice, arepas, and other starches, although wheat is not used. Llanero Ken, a doll dressed in the distinctive Llanero costume liqui liqui, including a customary starched hat, has become a popular doll in Venezuela.

==North American usage==
The Spanish also used the term to describe the nomadic tribes of the Llano Estacado of Texas and New Mexico and was applied to the Apache in particular.

In Spanish, The Lone Ranger is known as &quot;El Llanero Solitario&quot;.

<doc id="496474" wikidata="Q120300" url="?curid=496474" title="Crayon Shin-chan">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; made its first appearance in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot;, which was published by Futabasha. Due to the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on September 11, 2009. A new manga began in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui&#x27;s team, titled .

An animated television adaptation began airing on TV Asahi in 1992 and is still ongoing, with 1267 episodes. The show has been dubbed in 30 languages which aired in 45 countries. As of 2023, both the &quot;Crayon Shin-Chan&quot; and &quot;New Crayon Shin-Chan&quot; series has over 148 million copies in circulation, making it among the best-selling manga series in history.

==Synopsis==

Set in the city of Kasukabe of Saitama Prefecture within the Greater Tokyo Area of Japan, the series follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke &quot;Shin&quot; Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and best friends. Most of the plot is about Shin-chan&#x27;s daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.

Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan&#x27;s occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his &quot;Mr. Elephant&quot; impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children&#x27;s song &quot;Zou-san&quot; (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humour.

The series is mainly of comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo, leading to parents forbidding their children to watch it. However, due to its popularity, it&#x27;s also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply everywhere. Most episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka&#x27;s boyfriend dying in the manga, though it was not adapted into an anime episode. It also includes several horror adaptations, for example &quot;The Line of no End&quot;, &quot;The Horrible Elevator&quot; and &quot;The Kindergarten Stairs&quot;.

Abnormal for his age, Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters in skimpy clothing who are much older than him, and an additional source of humour is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) &quot;Do you like green peppers?&quot; (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as &quot;How many times did you go to the police?&quot; to tough-looking men or &quot;How old are you?&quot; to elderly people. He is often shown twerking &amp; mooning to emphasise the nonsensical nature.

==Media==
===Manga===

&quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot;, written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui, debuted in Futabasha&#x27;s &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot; in 1990. It started as a spin-off of the character Shinnosuke Nikaido (二階堂信之介) of another series by Yoshito Usui, Darakuya Store Monogatari (だらくやストア物語). The chapters were collected into 50 tankōbon volumes, which were published under Futabasha&#x27;s &quot;Action Comics&quot; imprint, from April 11, 1992, to July 10, 2010.

Yoshito Usui died on September 11, 2009, after a fall at Mount Arafune. After Usui died, Futabasha originally planned to end &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; in November 2009. Upon discovering new manuscripts, Futabasha decided to extend the comic&#x27;s run until the March 2010 issue of the magazine, which shipped on February 5, 2010. Although the series formally ended on February 5, 2010, it was announced on December 1, 2009, that a new manga would begin in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui&#x27;s team, titled . This manga moved to a dedicated website after the magazine it was serialized in ended publication in late 2023.

A series of four bilingual Japanese-English manga were released in 1996 in Japan as Shin-chan: The Little Horror! (クレヨンしんちゃんの楽しいゾ英会話).

ComicsOne translated ten volumes of Crayon Shin-chan into English and released it in the United States of America. Occasional pop culture references familiar to Americans, such as Pokémon and Britney Spears, were added to increase the appeal to American audiences. The manga is mirrored from its original to read from left to right. Starting with the sixth volume, many of the names were changed to the ones used in the Vitello and Phuuz English version of the anime, even though the dub never aired in North America. This translation is rated Teen.

Since then, American publisher DrMaster took over the licenses of several manga series, including &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot;, from ComicsOne. No new volumes of &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; were released under the DrMaster imprint.

On July 28, 2007, DC Comics&#x27; manga division CMX announced the acquisition of the Crayon Shin-chan manga. The CMX version is rated Mature instead of Teen from ComicsOne, because of nudity, sexual humor, dirty and bad language. The first volume was released on February 27, 2008, with uncensored art, and the style of jokes that frequent the Adult Swim dub with some throw backs to the original version, such as his original greeting. However, volume 10 omitted a gag which was in the ComicsOne version.

On April 11, 2012, One Peace Books announced their release of the manga, which is a reprint of the CMX version, in an omnibus format. Three omnibus volumes were released simultaneously on October 15, 2012. Volume 4 was released on November 13, 2013, and included the Japanese volume 12, marking the first time that particular volume has an English translation.

The Crayon Shin-chan manga spin-off, Action Mask, is currently available as read-only/print-only subscription from Crunchyroll and Futabasha. The main Shin-chan manga is also available from Crunchyroll using the CMX version, concurrently up to volume 10.

===Anime===
====Television series====

An anime adaptation of &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot;, produced by Shin-Ei Animation, has aired in Japan on TV Asahi since April 13, 1992. The series was originally directed by Mitsuru Hongo from 1992 to 1996, and was replaced by Keiichi Hara from 1996 to 2004. Since 2004, the series is directed by Yuji Muto. The music in the series is composed by Toshiyuki Arakawa. The series was originally going to end in 1994 and have its time-slot replaced by a remake of &quot;Umeboshi Denka&quot;. However, because the series was a huge hit on TV Asahi, the network decided not to replace it.

An English subtitled version of &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; ran on KIKU in Hawaii from December 18, 1993, until December 2001 when Lacey Entertainment acquired the rights. The episodes were translated by Karlton Tomomitsu.

====Spin-offs====

A Spin-off &quot;SHIN-MEN&quot; which is set in a parallel world consists of 13 episodes aired from November 26, 2010, to September 14, 2012.

Another spin-off series called &quot;Crayon Shin-chan Gaiden&quot; consisting of four seasons is exclusively streaming on Amazon Prime Video worldwide with English, German, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese subtitles.

An anime spin-off series titled &quot;Super Shiro&quot; was announced on February 3, 2019. The spin-off focuses on Shin-chan&#x27;s dog Shiro. The series was directed by Masaaki Yuasa and animated at Science SARU. Kimiko Ueno handled series composition, while Tomohisa Shimoyama served as chief director. TV Asahi, Shin-Ei Animation, ADK EM, and Futabasha produced the anime. The series ran for 48 episodes, with each episode being five minutes long. The series premiered on October 14, 2019, on AbemaTV. An English dub premiered on Cartoon Network in Australia and Southeast Asia.

====Crossovers====
A special crossover series titled &quot;Kamen Rider Fourze x Crayon Shin-chan&quot; was aired in April 2012 featuring Shin-chan and Kamen Rider Fourze to promote &quot;Crayon Shin-chan: Fierceness That Invites Storm! Me and the Space Princess&quot;. On 2016 an animated crossover episode with Godzilla was broadcast in Japan. The &quot;Sanrio&quot; character Hello Kitty appeared in the first Reiwa-era episode of Crayon Shin-chan.

On 23 November 2018, Arashi member Masaki Aiba appeared as his character Tatsuya Kōenji, from drama &quot;Boku to Shippo to Kagurazaka&quot;, in a short at the end of episode 983, called &quot;Ora to Shippo to Kagurazaka dazo&quot;, where he examines Shinnosuke&#x27;s dog at the veterinary clinic.

====International releases====
The series was first dubbed into English by Vitello Productions in Burbank, California through 2001–2002, when TV Asahi and Lacey Entertainment decided to market the series worldwide. During the early 2000s, it ran on Fox Kids (and later Jetix) in the United Kingdom, on Fox Kids in Australia, on Channel i in Singapore and on RTÉ Two in the Republic of Ireland. Subtitled versions also aired on Stöd 2 in Iceland and on Arutz HaYeladim in Israel. RTÉ Two has not shown the series since 2005, and on Jetix UK, the series was eventually relegated to shorts in-between programs, as a slot-filler. The dub is of American origin, with veteran voice actors such as Kath Soucie, Russi Taylor, Grey DeLisle, Pat Fraley, Eric Loomis and Anndi McAfee playing the characters. Soucie voiced Shin and Misae.

In 2003, Phuuz entertainment inc. was commissioned by Lacey Entertainment and TV Asahi to continue in a similar style as the Vitello dub. But their episodes featured a new cast of voice artists (among others Diane Michelle, Julie Maddalena, Peter Doyle).

52 episodes have been produced of the Vitello dub and 52 episodes of the Phuuz dub. Vitello and Phuuz episodes lasted on an average 21 minutes and contained three segments of 5 to 7 minutes. Some of the dubs of the series used the Vitello dub as the source for the dubbing. Some dubs also dubbed the Phuuz dub afterwards.

Funimation (now Crunchyroll, LLC) acquired the Shin-chan North America license in 2006. As per all international licenses for the series, TV Asahi remained a licensing partner for North America.

Funimation&#x27;s version features a Texas-based cast of voice actors. Funimation&#x27;s dub takes many liberties with the source material and was heavily Americanized. Similar to the Vitello dub, episodes of the series were dubbed out of their original order, and segments were reordered. Additionally, many characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones. Many sexual references, dark humor, and references to current popular American culture were added. For example, in one scene, Ai and Penny argue over which one of them is Jessica Simpson (whose first album was not released until 1999) and which one is Ashlee Simpson (whose first album was not released until 2004), which is very different from the original Japanese script that dealt with many social issues within Japan at the time. At least two episodes reference Rudy Giuliani and his unsuccessful bid for president.

New, previously non-existent backstories were created, as well as significantly different personalities for the characters. For instance, the unseen father of Nene (known in the dub as &quot;Penny&quot;) was suggested to be physically abusive toward both his wife and daughter, and this was used as a source of black humor. Principal Enchou was rewritten as a half-Peruvian, half-Romani man with a complicated prior life that includes a stint as a magician, in which he accidentally injured scores of audience members. Ageo-sensei (known in the dub as &quot;Miss Polly&quot;), Shinnosuke&#x27;s teacher, was rewritten as a kinky nymphomaniac, while Shin&#x27;s schoolmate, Kazama, (known in the dub as &quot;Georgie&quot;) was portrayed as a hawkish young Republican.

The first 52 episodes of the dub aired on Adult Swim. All three seasons, 26 episodes per season, have also been released on DVD. Season 3, released in 2011, culminated in the official finale, effectively ending the Funimation series.

A fourth English dub of Crayon Shin-chan has been produced in Hong Kong by Red Angel Media in 2015 and was commissioned by LUK Internacional, the company that produces the Spanish, Portuguese, the second Italian and the second French dubs of Crayon Shin-chan and commissioned the Doraemon dub that aired on Boomerang UK. The dub was translated from LUK Internacional&#x27;s Spanish dub, which is close to the Japanese original and has no censorship. The first three volumes of the dub were released in the European and South African Nintendo 3DS eShop on December 22, 2016, and the fourth and fifth volumes were released on December 29, 2016. The dub is separated into five volumes, with the first volume being free while the other four cost €1.99/£1.79. The first volume contains two episodes while the other four contain 6 episodes each which makes 26 episodes in total.

In India, Hindi dubs of the anime started airing on Hungama TV on June 19, 2006. Later, it also began airing in Tamil and Telugu dubs. In 2024, Sony YAY! also started airing the Hindi dub. As of October 2024, 22 films have been dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu and aired on Hungama TV and Sony YAY!.

In the Philippines, IBC 13 aired a Filipino dub of the anime in the early 2000s with Shinnosuke being voiced by Filipino rapper Andrew E.

===Controversies===
A Hindi dub of the anime has aired on Hungama TV in India since June 19, 2006. There were complaints from parents over the main character&#x27;s behavior and the attitudes exhibited towards elders on the show, both of which were seen as a negative influence on children. The series was banned in October 2008 by the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on account of heavy nudity. After many requests from fans, the show returned to Hungama TV in 2009, albeit censored; scenes containing nudity were cut, and there were several changes to the dialogue to remove adult humor and better appeal to Indian culture.

A Portuguese dub of the anime has also aired on Biggs, with the segment of the 165th episode &quot;Dad&#x27;s Hospitalized Life&quot; causing major controversy in 2016, due to a scene where the nurses examine Shinnosuke&#x27;s anus, and compliment it, all while he acts and looks uncomfortable. Due to complaints from parents over concerns that the show was promoting softcore child pornography, the Portuguese Media Regulatory Authority ordered that the show should only be aired after 10:30 PM. Eventually, the show was slowly faded out of Biggs&#x27; schedule, and from Portuguese television. Later, the show returned to television through Portugal&#x27;s Fox Comedy, though on a limited run, with the show being removed from Fox Comedy Portugal after a few months.

Regulators from Indonesia, Vietnam &amp; South Korea have also described the show as &#x27;borderline pornography&#x27;.

In 1802, Zerah Phelps became the first European-American landowner in the Attica area, which had for centuries been part of territory of the Seneca Nation, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. As allies of the British, they were mostly forced out of New York after the American Revolution, when the Crown ceded control of its territory to the new United States.

He built and owned a gristmill, and was also the first business owner in Attica. By 1810 the settlement had grown into a town., Malaria and plague drove the settlers to higher ground. During the War of 1812, many people fled to this area from Buffalo, which was vulnerable to British attack from the Great Lakes.

<doc id="496486" wikidata="Q1478712" url="?curid=496486" title="Princes Highway">
<text>Princes Highway is a major road in Australia, extending from Sydney via Melbourne to Adelaide through the states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It has a length of (along Highway 1) or via the former alignments of the highway, although these routes are slower and connections to the bypassed sections of the original route are poor in many cases.

The highway follows the coastline for most of its length, and thus takes quite an indirect and lengthy route. For example, it is from Sydney to Melbourne on Highway 1 as opposed to on the more direct Hume Highway (National Highway 31), and from Melbourne to Adelaide compared to on the Western and Dukes Highways (National Highway 8). Because of the rural nature and lower traffic volumes over much of its length, Princes Highway is a more scenic and leisurely route than the main highways between these major cities.

==Route==

===New South Wales===
Princes Highway starts at the junction of Broadway (Great Western Highway) and City Road in the Sydney suburb of Chippendale. City Road in fact forms the first section of the highway, and becomes King Street, Newtown, also part of Princes Highway. Where King Street ends at Sydney Park Road, Princes Highway continues in its own right.

The highway in this section is constructed as a six-lane divided carriageway, other than along King Street (four-lane undivided) and along the western edge of the Royal National Park, where it is built as four-lane dual carriageway. 

The only major engineering structures along its route are the twin Tom Uglys Bridge across Georges River. The northbound bridge is of steel truss construction, opened in 1929, whilst the southbound bridge is of prestressed concrete girders, opened in 1987.

It runs through Sydney&#x27;s southern suburbs (the St George area and Sutherland Shire), via Kogarah, Sutherland and Engadine to the village of Waterfall.
South of Waterfall the highway is paralleled by the Princes Motorway (national route M1) to the top of Bulli Pass outside the city of Wollongong, which carries the majority of traffic. The Princes Highway then enters the northern suburbs of Wollongong and the Illawarra region via the Bulli Pass, whilst Mount Ousley Road, which is designated as part of national route 1, bypasses Wollongong&#x27;s northern suburbs to meet the Princes Highway at , and carries inter-city traffic. Where Mount Ousley Road enters Wollongong, the Princes Motorway branches off Mount Ousley Road, and parallels the highway through the suburbs of Wollongong to . 

The Mount Ousley Road-Princes Motorway route is the inter-city and main urban arterial through Wollongong&#x27;s southern suburbs, whereas the Princes Highway acts as a local arterial.

From the interchange with the Princes Motorway at Yallah, the Princes Highway continues through the bypassed Albion Park Rail before reaching the southern terminus of the motorway at the Oak Flats interchange. From Oak Flats, the Princes Highway is dual carriageway, mostly of freeway standard, with the exception of the Kiama bends at Kiama Heights. 

The highway then travels along the upgraded sections through Gerringong and Foxground before bypassing the town of Berry, where the highway follows larger gradients, compared to the flat terrain the Illawarra railway line follows immediately to the east.

Beyond Mullers Lane, Berry, the highway is a single two lane carriageway to Cambewarra Road, . Construction is underway for the duplication of the highway from Mullers Lane to Cambewarra Road and is expected to be completed in 2022.

From Cambewarra Road the highway is four lane divided through Bomaderry and to near the junction with Warra Warra Road in South Nowra. Duplication to dual carriageway standard of a length south from here to Forest Road was scheduled for completion in early 2014, following a three-month cessation of work while measures were put in place to protect a hitherto unknown area of habitat of the endangered green and golden bell frog. Beyond this section is of four lane single carriageway from Forest Road to the junction with Jervis Bay Road.

From Jervis Bay Road southward the highway is mostly single two lane carriageway along the NSW South Coast, passing through Ulladulla, Batemans Bay (where the town centre bypass is built as dual carriageway), Moruya, Narooma, then bypassing Bega and Merimbula and passing through Eden, before crossing the border at the Black-Allen Line into Victoria, from Sydney and from Melbourne.

A substandard alignment at Victoria Creek south of was upgraded in 2012–13, as well as the Bega bypass. Realignments with associated new bridges are also proposed at Termeil Creek, some south of Ulladulla, and Dignams Creek, some south of Narooma. Current identified future projects are a bypass of Nowra-Bomaderry (definite route identified only for section south of Shoalhaven River), and a bypass of Ulladulla-Milton.

In 2007 the NRMA claimed Princes Highway was a dangerous road with ten fatalities and 729 people injured on the highway between Sydney and the state border in 2006.

=== Victoria ===
In Victoria, Princes Highway follows a very long and complex route. The route within metropolitan Melbourne carries the original individual names of sections of Princes Highway on signage. Each road section has Princes Highway labelled in bold and the individual name in brackets, such as Dandenong Road or Geelong Road.

Apart from the routes Alt National Route 1, C101 and C109 (in the outer metropolitan areas – such as Berwick and Werribee), the M1 Freeway route intersects (Monash Freeway/CityLink/West Gate Freeway/Princes Freeway) and this carries the much higher volume of traffic, including congestion in the peak periods, serving as the major, most direct and quickest route for Route 1 in Australia.

In Victoria the length from the South Australian border to the New South Wales border is . The highway passes (from east to west) through Orbost, Bairnsdale and Sale in the Gippsland region. The highway then passes through the Latrobe Valley, bypassing Morwell, Warragul and Pakenham to Dandenong and into the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Most of this section is freeway standard, with the main outstanding work being a freeway bypass of Traralgon, although the highway through Traralgon has already been built to urban dual carriageway standard.

Through much of Melbourne and its suburbs, the designation of National Route 1 is not along Princes Highway, but rather Monash Freeway, which intersects the Princes Highway on the eastern outskirts of Melbourne, then the southern link of the CityLink tollway, and then West Gate Freeway which bypasses central Melbourne. This avoids the confusing and congested arrangement of roads that is the Princes Highway in central Melbourne. The M1 include an advanced freeway management system for its entire urban length, between Narre Warren and Werribee. Along with freeway sensors and associated data stations, overhead lane use management system (LUMS) gantries that show speed and lane availability, electronic message boards, real-time drive time signs and arterial road real-time Information signs (before the on-ramps); there are the 64+ ramp signal and metering sites. Hence, the majority of the on-ramps are traffic light controlled, depending on the density and speed of the traffic.

Heading towards Geelong in a south-west direction, the West Gate Freeway and Geelong Road join and become the Princes Freeway. Which, unusually for an Australian inter-city freeway, carries enough traffic to merit four to three lanes in either direction (often still being congested in the morning and afternoon peaks). On the northern outskirts of Geelong, the highway reverts from freeway to three lane dual carriageway through Geelong and its suburbs, with traffic light-controlled at-grade intersections. Through Geelong the highway is often heavily congested.

With the completion of the freeway standard Geelong Ring Road during 2008–9, the M1 route follows the freeway-standard road from Winchelsea to Traralgon, without encountering any traffic lights (with the exception of Yarragon and Trafalgar, which are yet to be bypassed). The ring road rejoins the original highway at Waurn Ponds on the western edge of Geelong.

Within Geelong, Princes Highway starts at the junction of Princes Freeway in the northern Geelong suburb of Corio, and runs through Geelong&#x27;s northern and southern suburbs via an inner-city western bypass of the Geelong City Centre, to the current Highway 1 segment of the Princes Highway at Waurn Ponds in Geelong&#x27;s southern suburbs. The highway is six lane dual carriageway from Corio to Latrobe Terrace, continuing as a four-lane dual carriageway to Waurn Ponds. The 1989 re-alignment of Princes Highway (along La Trobe Terrace) provides a dual carriageway, four-lane limited access road to replace the original route along Moorabool Street in South Geelong and High Street in Belmont. Upon the completion of the final section of the Geelong Ring Road, another section of the Princes Highway was superseded in 2013 at Waurn Ponds.

After Geelong the highway heads in a generally western direction, continuing with the &#x27;M1&#x27; designation as a dual carriageway road to Winchelsea (opened 2015). West of Winchelsea, the road is presently being reconstructed to dual carriageway standard, passing through Colac, before reaching Camperdown - ultimately reaching the port of Warrnambool. The section from Geelong to Warrnambool runs inland, and so avoids the slower, but scenic Great Ocean Road. From here, Princes Highway passes through Portland before crossing the border into South Australia. At this point the highway is from Sydney, from Melbourne and from Adelaide.

=== South Australia ===
At Mount Gambier the highway takes a more northward tack as the coast curves to the northwest, passing the Coorong National Park. After Kingston SE, it turns inland (north) to avoid the lakes at the mouth of the River Murray. Shortly before Tailem Bend it is joined by Dukes Highway, part of the main route between Melbourne and Adelaide. The highway then turns north-west and becomes South Eastern Freeway, crosses the Murray River, bypasses Murray Bridge and continues to Glen Osmond on Adelaide&#x27;s southeastern outskirts.

At this point, Princes Highway is from Adelaide and from Sydney. It continues north-west via Glen Osmond Road to eventually terminate just south of the Adelaide city centre.

==History==
The section of Princes Highway between West Helensburgh and Bulli Tops was the original coastal route between Sydney and Wollongong, first used in 1843. From Bulli Tops this route continued south along today&#x27;s Mount Ousley Road as far south as Mount Keira Road, and then followed Mount Keira Road around the west of Mount Keira. This route replaced the inland route from Sydney via to Bulli Tops.

As a named route, the highway came into being when pre-existing roads were renamed Prince&#x27;s Highway after the planned visit to Australia by the Prince of Wales (later to become king Edward VIII and, after abdicating, the Duke of Windsor) in 1920. The original submissions in January 1920 were in order for the Prince to have the opportunity during his visit to make the trip from Melbourne to Sydney overland along the route. Different routes were considered, including the inland route via . That idea never came to fruition, due partly to the limited amount of time and the cost of upgrading the road to a suitable standard for him to undertake the trip. The Prince did, however, give his permission for the naming.

The highway had opening ceremonies in both New South Wales and Victoria during 1920. The first section of road from Melbourne was opened on 10 August in Warragul. The road from Sydney was opened in Bulli on 19 October, by the NSW Minister for Local Government, Thomas Mutch.

Within Victoria, the passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1912&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the establishment of the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) and their ability to declare Main Roads, taking responsibility for the management, construction and care of the state&#x27;s major roads from local municipalities. (Main) Gippsland Road was declared a Main Road over a period of months, from 10 November 1913 (Longwarry through Drouin to Warragul), 1 December 1913 (Mulgrave through Dandenong and Pakenham to Longwarry, and Warragul through Moe, Morwell and Traralgon to Rosedale), 2 February 1914 (Rosedale through Sale and Stratford to Bairnsdale), to 23 March 1914 (Prahran through Oakleigh and Mulgrave to Clayton); Orbost-Genoa Road from Orbost via Cann River to Genoa, and Swan Reach-Cunninghame Road from Bairnsdale via Swan Reach to Lakes Entrance, were declared Main Roads on 23 March 1914; and lastly, Genoa-Eden Road from Genoa to the interstate border with New South Wales and Eden beyond, was declared a Main Road on 7 September 1914; all were renamed in August 1920. {Melbourne-) Geelong Road was declared a Main Road from Footscray via Werribee and Little River to Corio on 30 December 1913; Geelong-Colac Road from Geelong to Waurn Ponds, Geelong-Warrnambool Road from Waurn Ponds via Colac and Terang to Warnambool, Warrnambool-Port Fairy Road from Warrnambool to Port Fairy, were declared Main Roads on 16 March 1914, and Port Fairy-Portland Road from Port Fairy to Portland was declared a Main Road on 16 November 1914; before approval was given by the Victorian executive in January 1922 to extend Princes Highway west from Melbourne through Geelong, Camperdown, Warrnambool and Portland to the South Australian border. The passing of the &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot; provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board. Prince&#x27;s Highway was declared a State Highway on 1 July 1925, traversing the whole length of the state from its western boundary near Mount Gambier in South Australia, through Port Fairy, Warrnambool, Geelong to Melbourne, through Dandenong, Warragul, Sale, Bairnsdale and Orbost to the eastern boundary of the state towards Eden in New South Wales (for a total of 540 miles), subsuming the original declarations of (Main) Gippsland Road, Swan Reach-Cunninghame Road, Orbost-Genoa Road, Genoa-Eden Road, {Melbourne-) Geelong Road, Geelong-Colac Road, Geelong-Warrnambool Road, Warrnambool-Port Fairy Road and Port Fairy-Portland Road as Main Roads.

Within New South Wales, the passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 1 was declared along Prince&#x27;s Highway on 8 August 1928, heading south from the City of Sydney through Sutherland, Wollongong, Nowra, Bateman&#x27;s Bay and Eden to the southern boundary of the state towards Genoa in Victoria (for a total of 351.5 miles). With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 1 on 8 April 1929. Before the adoption of the &quot;Prince&#x27;s Highway&quot; name in 1920, the road between Sydney and the border was referred to as the Coast Road.

Within South Australia, roads from Adelaide to the South Australian border with Victoria were renamed by the State government in February 1922. At that time, the route from Adelaide was via Aldgate, Mylor, Macclesfield, Strathalbyn, and Langhorne Creek, crossing the Murray River at Wellington, then continuing along the present towns of Meningie, Kingston SE, Robe, Beachport, Millicent and Gambier Town (Mount Gambier). By 1928, the route went through Mount Barker and Wistow to Langhorne Creek. By 1935, the Princes Highway passed through Nairne and Kanmantoo, Murray Bridge and Tailem Bend (now known as the &quot;Old Princes Highway&quot;). That road was superseded by the South Eastern Freeway (Crafers-Murray Bridge in stages 1967–1979), Swanport Bridge (1979), finally extended from Crafers to Glen Osmond (2000). The section between Kingston SE and Millicent has also been replaced by a more direct inland route. The coastal route through Robe and Beachport is now route B101, the Southern Ports Highway.

In 1942, as part of wartime defence measures, a road was built from Mount Keira Road to . This route forms part of Mount Ousley Road.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Princes Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 1, from the intersection with Broadway in Chippendale in Sydney, to the state border with Victoria.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: VicRoads re-declared the road in 2010 as Princes Highway West (Arterial #6500), beginning at the state border with South Australia to Geelong, then from Altona North to Parkville; and in 2007 as Princes Highway East (Arterial #6510), beginning at the Melbourne CBD to Narre Warren, then from Yarragon to Trafalgar, then from Morwell to the state border with New South Wales.

In August 2011, the stretch of the highway in South Australia between Adelaide and Port Augusta (commonly referred to as &quot;Highway 1&quot;) was renamed Port Wakefield Highway (between Adelaide and Port Wakefield) and Augusta Highway (between Port Wakefield and Port Augusta) as part of a process to standardise the rural property addressing system across the state.

===Timeline of significant upgrades and bypasses===
====Projects====
===Route allocation===
Princes Highway was signed National Route 1 across its entire length in 1955. The Whitlam government introduced the federal &quot;National Roads Act 1974&quot;, where roads declared as a National Highway were still the responsibility of the states for road construction and maintenance, but were fully compensated by the Federal government for money spent on approved projects. As an important interstate link between the capitals of South Australia and Victoria, the parts of Princes Highway not already replaced by South Eastern Freeway between Adelaide and Tailem Bend were declared a National Highway in 1974. With all three states&#x27; conversion to their newer alphanumeric systems between the late 1990s to the early 2010s, its former route number for the most part was updated to A1 for the highway within Victoria (in 1997), South Australia (in 1998), and eventually the New South Wales section (in 2013), but with many exceptions: see below.

====Former routes====

The gazetted route of Princes Highway today differs from the route of State Route 60 (and from that shown on road signs). The gazetted route was designated State Route 60 (now part of route B65, Memorial Drive) for its length, but deviated from the road that is signposted as Princes Highway between and .

<text>The Gray Race is the ninth full-length album of the punk rock band Bad Religion, which was released in 1996. It was the follow-up to the band&#x27;s highly successful 1994 album &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;.

This was the band&#x27;s first album not recorded with original guitarist Brett Gurewitz (since the 1985 EP &quot;Back to the Known&quot;) and is their first release with Brian Baker, who replaced him during the &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; tour.

Some songs on the album are considered fan favorites, such as, &quot;Them And Us&quot;, &quot;A Walk&quot;, &quot;Punk Rock Song&quot;, &quot;Spirit Shine&quot;, &quot;Ten in 2010&quot;, &quot;Come Join Us&quot;, and &quot;Cease&quot;.

Although not as successful as &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, &quot;The Gray Race&quot; achieved modest success when MTV ran a commercial for the album during its release. The album was re-released by Epitaph Records on September 15, 2008.

==Production and marketing==

After the 10-month &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; tour, frontman Graffin soon began writing songs for &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;″s follow-up. The band recorded it at Electric Lady Studios, New York City with producer Ric Ocasek (of the Cars, Bad Brains and Weezer fame). The recording lasted throughout much of October and November 1995.

==Reception==
&quot;The Gray Race&quot; was released on February 27, 1996, and peaked at No. 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. It spawned the moderately successful single &quot;A Walk&quot; in the United States. In Europe, the album also reached the German charts at No. 6 as well as earn the group a gold record for sales in Scandinavia. Then-former and now current guitarist Brett Gurewitz disliked the album, however, and commented that it was &quot;BR&#x27;s worst-selling record to date&quot; and described it as &quot;uninspired.&quot; He has since taken that back.
 Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote that Baker &quot;not only brings new blood to the band, but also some superior guitar work. Gritty classics, tougher than recent offerings, dance on an edge not visited since the days of &quot;Generator&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="496494" wikidata="Q6911256" url="?curid=496494" title="Morehead Planetarium and Science Center">
<text>Morehead Planetarium and Science Center is located on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. As a unit of the university, Morehead receives about one-third of its funding through state sources, one-third through ticket and gift sales, and one-third through gifts and grants.

First opened in 1949, the dome theater in planetarium was used to train astronauts from the Gemini, Apollo, Mercury, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz missions in celestial navigation. Eleven of the twelve astronauts who walked on the Moon trained at Morehead Planetarium. Until the late 1990s, it contained one of the largest working Copernican orreries in the world. The facility was donated to the university by alumnus John Motley Morehead III who invested more than $3 million in the facility.

== History ==
Morehead Planetarium opened on May 10, 1949 after seventeen months of construction. The first planetarium in the South, it was the eight to be built in the United States. The planetarium was the first built on a university campus worldwide. Designed by Eggers &amp; Higgins, the same architects who planned the Jefferson Memorial, the $3 million cost of its construction (approximately $ million in today&#x27;s dollars) made it the most expensive building in North Carolina at the time. Morehead Planetarium was officially dedicated during a ceremony held on May 10, 1949.

Since Zeiss, the German firm that produced planetarium projectors, had lost most of its factories during World War II, there were very few projectors available at the time. Morehead had to travel to Sweden, where he had previously served as American ambassador, to purchase a Zeiss Model II to serve as the heart of North Carolina&#x27;s new planetarium.

&quot;Let There Be Light&quot; was the planetarium&#x27;s first show.

===NASA===
From 1959 through 1975 every astronaut in the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo–Soyuz Test Project programs spent hours in celestial navigation training at the planetarium. Morehead technicians developed simplified replicas of flight modules and tools for use in the training, often from plywood or cardboard. A mockup simulating key parts of the Gemini capsule was constructed from plywood and mounted on a barber chair to enable changes in pitch and yaw. Several of these items are on display at the planetarium. That training may have helped save astronauts&#x27; lives on occasion. Astronauts aboard Apollo 12 called upon that training after their Saturn V rocket was hit by lightning twice during ascent, knocking spacecraft systems offline and requiring them to configure navigation systems based on fixes taken manually. Gordon Cooper used his training to make the most-accurate landing of Project Mercury after a power failure affected navigational systems. Astronauts enjoyed soft drinks, cookies and other snacks during their intense hours-long training session, leading planetarium employees to create the code name &quot;cookie time&quot; to refer to the training sessions. Occasionally, word of the sessions leaked out and noted clothing designer and Chapel Hill native Alexander Julian recalls meeting Mercury Astronauts during a visit to the planetarium while in junior high.

The first astronaut to train at Morehead, in March 1964, was Neil Armstrong. Armstrong visited again only months before the 1969 launch of Apollo 11, spending a total of 20 days at Morehead over 11 training sessions, more than any other astronaut. Astronauts commented that the &quot;large dome&quot; was &quot;highly realistic&quot;, calling the facility &quot;superb&quot;.

In all, the astronauts who trained at the planetarium were Buzz Aldrin, Joseph P. Allen, William Anders, Neil Armstrong, Charles Bassett, Alan Bean, Frank Borman, Vance D. Brand, John S. Bull, Scott Carpenter, Gerald P. Carr, Eugene Cernan, Roger B. Chaffee, Philip K. Chapman, Michael Collins, Pete Conrad, Gordon Cooper, Walter Cunningham, Charles Duke, Donn F. Eisele, Anthony W. England, Joe Engle, Ronald E. Evans, Theodore Freeman, Edward Givens, John Glenn, Richard F. Gordon Jr., Gus Grissom, Fred Haise, Karl Gordon Henize, James Irwin, Joseph P. Kerwin, William B. Lenoir, Don L. Lind, Anthony Llewellyn, Jack R. Lousma, Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly, Bruce McCandless II, James McDivitt, Curt Michel, Edgar Mitchell, Story Musgrave, Brian O&#x27;Leary, Robert A. Parker, William R. Pogue, Stuart Roosa, Wally Schirra, Rusty Schweickart, David Scott, Elliot See, Alan Shepard, Deke Slayton, Thomas P. Stafford, Jack Swigert, William E. Thornton, Paul J. Weitz, Ed White, Clifton Williams, Alfred M. Worden, and John Young.

== Fulldome planetarium ==
Morehead&#x27;s planetarium seats about 240 people, with a dome that is in diameter and tall. It currently has two different projection systems.

In February 2010, Morehead introduced its new fulldome digital video (FDV) projection system, the largest FDV installation in the southeastern United States. Funding for the new system was provided by GlaxoSmithKline, and the planetarium&#x27;s star theater is now named the GlaxoSmithKline Fulldome Theater.

Morehead&#x27;s historic star projector, a Carl Zeiss Model VI, was installed in 1969 and remained in limited use as of April 2011, primarily for field trip groups. This projector displays about 8,900 different stars on the dome overhead. The analog planetarium shows are a combined effort of the Zeiss projector, slide projectors and video projectors working together to form a multimedia experience. Planetarium officials hope to display at least a portion of the projector somewhere in the center. The projector was removed in August 2011.

== Exhibits ==
On February 23, 2007, Morehead opened its first interactive exhibit, &quot;Zoom In: Science at the Extremes&quot;. It features current science at the extremes of size and scale, including research done by UNC scientists.

&quot;The Ancient Carolinians&quot; opened on November 17, 2007. This exhibit explores the lives of the first people to live on the land now known as North Carolina, interpreting the use of 10,000-year-old artifacts from the Hardaway archaeological site. This exhibit is supported in part by the Alcoa Foundation, which donated the artifacts to the university. After January 1, 2009, the exhibit installation was removed so that &quot;The Ancient Carolinians&quot; could become Morehead&#x27;s first traveling exhibit.

== Science stage ==
Morehead Planetarium and Science Center offers live, educator-led programs in its Science Stage. &quot;Science LIVE!&quot; shows present the foundations of science, on a variety of topics, through experiments and demonstrations that often involve volunteers from the audience.

== External programs ==
The DESTINY Traveling Science Learning Program, which was founded by UNC in 2000, became part of Morehead in 2006.

The PLANETS Portable Planetarium Program brings the fulldome planetarium experience to elementary schools that are too far from Morehead to plan a field trip to the center.

== Jupiter Fellowship ==
Each year, the Jupiter Committee (a volunteer group that assists in planning the Jupiter Ball fundraising gala for Morehead) awards the Jupiter Fellowship. This award goes to the student employee(s) who submits the best proposal for a Morehead program, activity or innovation. The fellowship funds the implementation of the proposal.

== Morehead Observatory ==
Morehead Observatory, located on the east end of the top floor of the Morehead building, houses a Perkin-Elmer reflecting telescope operated by the UNC Physics and Astronomy Department. Faint object observing is still possible with narrow wavelength filters to block the city lights of Chapel Hill. The observatory supports research programs in bright star spectroscopy and optical counterparts of Gamma Ray Bursts.

<text>Australia″s Highway 1 is a network of highways that circumnavigate the country, joining all mainland capital cities except the national capital of Canberra. At a total length of approximately it is the longest national highway in the world, surpassing the Trans-Siberian Highway (over ) and the Trans-Canada Highway (). Over a million people traverse some part of the highway network every day. It is the longest continuing highway in the world as the Pan-American Highway is separated by the Darién Gap and AH1 is separated by the Sea of Japan. However it is not the longest continuous stretch of highway as both the northern section of the Pan-American Highway and the continental section of AH1 still out-measure it.

==History==
Highway 1 was created as part of the National Route Numbering system, adopted in 1955. The route was compiled from an existing network of state and local roads and tracks. Highway 1 is the only route to reach across all Australian states, plus the Northern Territory. Many of the other national routes are tributaries of Highway 1.

Under the original Highway 1 scheme, certain major traffic routes that ran parallel to the main route were designated National Route Alternative 1. Most of these route designations have been replaced by either a state route designation, or an alpha-numeric route designation, depending on which state the section is in. An example of the Alternative 1 designation remaining is on the old Princes Highway route from Dandenong to South Melbourne in Victoria.

===Route markers===
The entirety of Highway 1 was originally marked with a National Route 1 shield (black number on a white shield). In 1974, the segments of the route that were declared part of the National Highway network were updated to use the National Highway shield (gold number on a green shield).

Since that time, all states and territories except for Western Australia have adopted (or are in the process of adopting) alphanumeric route numbers. As a consequence, much of Highway 1 is now marked with a M1, A1 or B1 route marker (depending on the route&#x27;s quality and importance). A notable exception is in Tasmania, which was the first state to adopt alphanumeric route numbers but Highway 1 is still marked with a National Highway 1 shield.

In South Australia, sections of Highway 1 which were once part of the National Highway were marked as &quot;National Highway A1&quot; or &quot;National Highway M1&quot; but have since been replaced by the standard &quot;A1&quot; and &quot;M1&quot; shield markers

==Track==
Large sections of Highway 1 are shared with the Australian National Highway, though the two are not synonymous. Where they diverge, Highway 1 follows a coastal route, such as the Princes Highway from Sydney to Melbourne, whereas the National Highway follows an inland (and generally more direct) route between major cities, such as the Hume Highway and Freeway from Sydney to Melbourne.
From Sydney, it heads southwards to Melbourne and onwards toward Adelaide. This section mostly follows the Princes Highway, except sections where that highway has been bypassed by freeways. It leaves the Sydney central business district via the Eastern Distributor, and continues southward through the Sydney metropolitan area via Southern Cross Drive, General Holmes Drive, The Grand Parade, President Avenue, and the Princes Highway (NSW). From Sydney&#x27;s southern outskirts, it proceeds to Wollongong via the Princes Motorway, which bypasses the parallel section of the Princes Highway. Highway 1 returns to the Princes Highway south of Wollongong, from which it traverses the length of the NSW South Coast and into Victoria. East of Melbourne, Highway 1/Princes Highway turns into the eastern section of the Princes Freeway. Within Melbourne, this freeway turns into the Monash Freeway, and then into CityLink, which passes just south of the Melbourne central business district.

Highway 1 exits Melbourne to the west via the West Gate Freeway and the western section of the Princes Freeway towards Geelong, which it bypasses via the Geelong Ring Road. It then proceeds west following the Princes Highway to Warrnambool, into South Australia to Mount Gambier, and then to Adelaide.

From there it runs to Perth via Port Wakefield Road, Augusta Highway, Eyre Highway, Coolgardie-Esperance Highway, South Coast Highway and South Western Highway.

It then heads to Darwin via Brand Highway, North West Coastal Highway, Great Northern Highway, Victoria Highway, and Stuart Highway.

From Darwin, Highway 1 follows the Stuart Highway to Daly Waters, and thereafter the Carpentaria Highway to Borroloola. The Savannah Way is the largely unsignposted route for Highway 1 between the QLD/NT border, east of Borroloola, and Normanton, Queensland.
From there, it follows the Gulf Developmental Road and Kennedy Highway to Cairns and southwards via the Bruce Highway to Brisbane.

It then returns to Sydney via the Queensland/northern NSW section of the Pacific Motorway (QLD/NSW), the Pacific Highway (NSW), and the Sydney–Newcastle section of the Pacific Motorway. The motorway ends in Sydney&#x27;s northern suburbs, and Highway 1 follows the Pacific Highway through Sydney&#x27;s upper north shore, before turning onto the Gore Hill Freeway, Warringah Freeway. It crosses beneath Sydney Harbour in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, and follows the Cahill Expressway for a short stretch before joining the Eastern Distributor.

In Tasmania, Highway 1 starts at the Brooker Highway in Hobart and heads towards Launceston via the Midland Highway. At Launceston it becomes the Bass Highway to Burnie. Highway 1 ends at Burnie; the Bass Highway continues to Marrawah on the west coast as Highway A2.

===Route markers===
====The Savannah Way section====
The section from the eastern end of the Carpentaria Highway at Borroloola in the Northern Territory to the western end of the Gulf Developmental Road near Normanton in Queensland is part of the Savannah Way but has no highway name/s. Wollogorang Road runs from Borroloola to the NT/QLD border, and Westmoreland Road runs from there to Doomadgee. From there Doomadgee Road runs to Burketown, and Nardoo Burketown Road then runs to the Leichhardt River. Burketown Normanton Road runs from the river to the Burke Developmental Road near Normanton. National Highway 1 follows this south for to the Gulf Developmental Road.

==Road conditions==
With such a vast length, road conditions vary greatly; from multi-lane freeways in populous urban and rural areas, to sealed two-laners in remote areas, such as the Nullarbor Plain, to single lane roads, such as in northern Queensland.

Some stretches are very isolated, such as the Eyre Highway, which crosses the Nullarbor Plain, and the Great Northern Highway, which runs close to the north-western coastline. Isolated roadhouses serving the small amount of passing traffic are often the only signs of human activity for hundreds of kilometres.

Highway 1 has been described as a &quot;death trap&quot;, particularly two-lane sections in northern Queensland, due to driver fatigue. The vast distances between destinations and limited rest areas, especially those suitable to trucks, contribute to the problem.

==Sights==
Highway 1 covers practically every major inhabited part of Australia. Large capital cities, busy holiday resorts, dramatic coastlines, forests ranging from tropical to temperate gum forests, giant karri stands, scrubland, deserts, and huge tropical swamps are some of the variety of landscapes that can be found along the route.

Stretches of Highway 1 are very popular with interstate and overseas tourists. A drive around Highway 1 with a major detour to Uluru and back again practically covers most of Australia, making it a popular route for vanlifers and overlanders. The number 1 shield became part of the bush landscape to many travellers, truckers/truckies, and country people.

==Record==
On 18 June 2017 team Highway 1 to Hell set a new record for a complete lap of Australia. While there have been previous attempts (notably Motor Magazine&#x27;s 2004 record of 6 days, 8 hours and 52 minutes) which skipped inland direct to Mt Isa, the Highway 1 to Hell team travelled the route of Highway 1 skipping Tasmania&#x27;s stretch of road (equaling ) in 5 days, 13 hours and 43 minutes.

<text>Alzey () is a &quot;Verband&quot;-free town – one belonging to no &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; – in the Alzey-Worms district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is the fifth-largest town in Rhenish Hesse, after Mainz, Worms, Ingelheim am Rhein and Bingen.

Alzey is one of the &quot;Nibelungenstädte&quot; – towns associated with the – because it is represented in this work by the character Volker von Alzey. Hence, Alzey is also known as &quot;Volkerstadt&quot;.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Alzey lies in Rhenish Hesse on the western edge of the northern part of the Upper Rhine Plain. It is surrounded by the northern part of the Alzey Hills, which meets the Rhenish Hesse Hills towards the south and the North Palatine Uplands towards the east. The town is found some 30 km southwest of Mainz and some 22 km (as the crow flies, in each case) northwest of Worms. Through Alzey, in places underground, flows the river Selz, a left-bank tributary to the Rhine.

=== Climate ===
Alzey has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;). Yearly precipitation in Alzey amounts to , which is rather low, falling into the lowest fourth of the precipitation chart for all of Germany. At 18% of the German Weather Service&#x27;s weather stations, even lower figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in July. In that month, precipitation is 1.9 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies moderately. At 41% of the weather stations, lower seasonal swings are recorded.

The Alzey weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 7 August 2015 and 25 July 2019.
* Its lowest temperature was on 2 February 1956.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 1965.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1953.
* The longest annual sunshine was 2214 hours in 2022.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1400 hours in 1977.

== History ==

=== From the Neolithic to the early first millennium ===

The earliest traces of settlement in the Alzey area go back as far as the Neolithic. Alzey was founded as a &quot;vicus&quot; (village) in the Roman province of Germania Superior in the lands surrounding Mogontiacum (Mainz).

The name of Alzey is first mentioned on a &quot;Nymphenstein&quot; (a Roman altar stone dedicated to nymphs), dedicated on 22 November 223 by the &quot;Vicani Altiaienses&quot; (&quot;Villagers of Alzey&quot;). The name &quot;Altiaia&quot; could well originate from the name of an older, pre-Roman Celtic settlement of about 400 BC, although the name&#x27;s exact origins have not been passed down to the present day. Over the ruins of the Roman village, which was destroyed about 350, a fort, Castra Alteium, was built about 390. In 406 and 407, the Burgundians, together with the Vandals, crossed the Rhine and settled in Mainz, Alzey and Worms as Roman confederates. The area was secured for them by treaty. In 436, the Burgundian kingdom was destroyed by the Western Roman &quot;magister militum&quot; Flavius Aëtius with help from Hunnish troops. These events were worked into the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; and form the origin of the legendary figure Volker von Alzey, the gleeman in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. After 450, Alzey passed to the Alamanni and the Franks when they took over the land. After Clovis I&#x27;s death in 511, the Frankish Empire fell apart into separate smaller kingdoms, and Alzey became part of Austrasia, whose capital was at Metz. Following the unification of the Frankish kingdoms in the mid-8th century, Alzey was assigned by the 843 Treaty of Verdun to the Kingdom of the East Franks, a forerunner of the German Empire. In 897, Alzey was first mentioned as an Imperial fief.

=== 12th century to early 20th century ===
In 1156, Alzey belonged to the Electorate of the Palatinate, and Konrad von Staufen attained the rank of Count Palatine in the Imperial castle, which had been completed in 1118. In 1277, Alzey attained the rank of town from Rudolf von Habsburg. In 1620, Count Spinola sided with the Catholic Emperor in the Thirty Years&#x27; War against the Protestant Electorate of the Palatinate and also conquered Alzey. In 1689, the town and the castle, under the French troops&#x27; scorched-earth policy, were burnt down in the Nine Years&#x27; War, when Louis XIV&#x27;s armies had to leave areas conquered earlier. In 1798, areas west of the Rhine, among them those that until this time had been parts of the Electorate of the Palatinate, were annexed to France. Alzey belonged until 1814 to the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). In 1816, Alzey was attached to the Grand Duchy of Hesse. In 1909, the winemaking school (now the &quot;Landesanstalt für Rebenzüchtung&quot;) was founded. Its first head was Georg Scheu, after whom the grape variety Scheurebe is named.

=== Third Reich ===
On Kristallnacht (9 November 1938), the Alzey synagogue was destroyed and the fittings were burnt in front of the building. The ruin was removed in the 1950s. A rescued Torah scroll can nowadays be found in the museum. On 8 January 1945, in World War II, the town narrowly missed being destroyed when 36 Boeing B-17 bombers had been sent to take out a railway bridge in Alzey. Owing to bad weather and a landmark misinterpretation – the crew mistook the top of the old watchtower for the church steeple – the bombers ended up dropping their load on the Wartberg, a nearby hill, giving rise to the legend of the Wartbergturm – the old tower – as Alzey&#x27;s saviour.

=== Since 1945 ===
Since 1947, Alzey has no longer been Hessian, but rather it became the seat of Alzey District in the newly formed state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Since the merger of the old Alzey and Worms Districts in 1969, Alzey has been the seat of the new Alzey-Worms District and the seat of the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Alzey-Land, although as a &quot;Verband&quot;-free town, it does not actually belong to the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot;.

=== Amalgamations ===
On 22 April 1972, the formerly autonomous centres of Weinheim, Heimersheim and Dautenheim were amalgamated with Alzey. The outlying centre of Schafhausen had already been a &quot;Stadtteil&quot; (constituent community) of Alzey since the Middle Ages.

==== Jewish History ====
The town&#x27;s Jewish congregation is dated to the 14th century. In 1349, during the Black Death, the town&#x27;s Jews were murdered in the cause of a blood libel. A few years after, the community renewed and a document from 1377 depicted a Jew named Yitschak of Alzey who sued the town of Worms for not paying its debt to him. In 1389, a &quot;Jew Alley&quot; is first mentioned, depicting a kind of Ghetto with a gate, which closes at night. 

Jews appeared once again in town only by the 17th century, and the first synagogue was built only by 1791. Several documents from around 1670, depict disputes between Joseph Simon Jessel, a Jew who lived in Alzey and the town butchers, regarding his wish to open a business. On another dispute between him and a neighbor who sold his house to Jessel but refused to evacuate, the verdict blamed both sides - Jessel for it was &quot;unthinkable that a Jew will hit a Christian&quot;, and the neighbor for not evacuating the house. Nevertheless, the Count of Palatine Zweibrücken protected the Jews, whose high taxes were a dominant factor of his income.
In 1789, there were 21 Jewish households in town. 
During the 18th century, most of the town Jews were established if not rich. in 1710, a Jew called Simcha Deidesheimer founded a large Matzo factory that existed until 1925 and exported its products to France and Italy. In addition, two brothers named Levy opened a porcelain factory in town in 1770. 
The community had a local cemetery Alzey was the hometown of well-known family Belmont; In 1844, Jewish Shimon Belmont (the ancestor of American politicians August Belmont and August Belmont JR. was elected as the president of the &#x27;Narhalle&#x27; carnival, which he initiated, intended for the town&#x27;s high classes. He donated some money to the cemetery and other community facilities. 
Eight of Alzey Jews died as soldiers during World War I.
According to town municipality, 76 Jews were expelled from the town to Nazi concentration camps around Europe.
In 1954, one Jew returned to Alzey.

<doc id="496509" wikidata="Q7781163" url="?curid=496509" title="Them (novel)">
<text>Them (stylized in all lowercase) is a novel by Joyce Carol Oates, the third in her &quot;Wonderland Quartet&quot; following &quot;A Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; (1967) and &quot;Expensive People&quot; (1968) and preceding &quot;Wonderland&quot; (1971). It was published by Vanguard in 1969 and it won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1970.

Many years and many awards later, Oates surmised that &quot;them&quot; and &quot;Blonde&quot; (2000) were the works she will most be remembered for, and would most want a new reader to select, though she added that &quot;I could as easily have chosen a number of titles.&quot;

==Genesis==

In the book&#x27;s foreword, Oates writes that &quot;them&quot; is based for the most part upon the life of a real family. The main character, &quot;Maureen Wendall,&quot; contacted Oates by mail after she had failed a college course taught by the author, and these letters are included (presumably verbatim) in the novel, about two-thirds of the way through the text. 

Saying that &quot;the novel practically wrote itself,&quot; Oates organized the story and recast it as fiction, but at certain points she revised the text to include &quot;Maureen Wendall&#x27;s&quot; words verbatim. Oates noted that, rather than sensationalizing the story of the Wendalls to make slum life more lurid, she softened some sections so that they would not overwhelm the reader. She said that the confessional aspect was, at least temporarily, extremely therapeutic to &quot;Maureen Wendall&quot; and that all the family members were still living.

In an addendum to the afterword, Oates said that the &quot;realist&quot; element was a literary device: all characters and events were entirely fictional. She wrote Maureen&#x27;s letters, and the &quot;Miss Oates&quot; to whom the letters are written is also a fictional character. At the time (1962–1967), Oates used the name of Joyce Smith.

==Plot==

&quot;Them&quot; explores the complex struggles of American life through three down-on-their-luck characters—Loretta, Maureen, and Jules—who are attempting to reach normality and the American dream through marriage and money.

The story begins with Loretta Botsford and her brother Brock as teenagers, living in the 1930s in a &quot;fair-sized city on a midwestern canal&quot;. Loretta falls in love with Bernie Malin, and sleeps with him. Later in the night, Brock fatally shoots Bernie in the head. Loretta runs away, and meets Howard Wendall, an older cop to whom she confesses the death of Bernie Malin. 

They later marry, and she bears son Jules (who is hinted to be Bernie Malin&#x27;s son). Loretta and Howard live close to Mama and Papa Wendall&#x27;s house, on the south side of town. Soon after the birth of Jules, Howard is busted for taking money from prostitutes. The Wendalls move into the country house with Howard&#x27;s family, where Loretta bore her daughters Maureen and Betty.

When World War II breaks out, Howard leaves his family to fight in Europe. Meanwhile, Jules grows up to be a fast, energetic child who hangs around older children, and is never still. Maureen is a quiet, shy, delicate girl, while Betty is a smart aleck. Jules as a child displays a fascination with fire when he burns down a deserted barn, and when a plane crashes in Detroit.

Loretta decides to move to Detroit with her children while Howard is still at war. Jules takes on the role of the &quot;bad boy&quot; who hangs out with kids who steal from stores and smoke at school. Many conclude that Jules will not live past twenty. Soon Jules is expelled from the Catholic school and sent to a public school apart from his sisters.

As time progresses, Jules becomes more involved in petty theft. He falls passionately in love with a rich girl, Nadine, from the suburbs, whom he helps to run away to Texas. She abandons him in a hotel when he becomes ill, and steals his car and money.

After Howard dies in a work accident, Loretta remarries. She relies increasingly on Maureen to run the household. Feeling the desire to escape, Maureen turns to prostitution to build an escape fund. When her stepfather discovers her secret, he savagely beats her. He is convicted and jailed for assault, resulting in Loretta divorcing him, and Maureen suffering a year-long nervous breakdown. She gradually recovers with the care of Loretta&#x27;s brother Brock, who has unexpectedly returned, and the letters of Jules, who slowly drifts back North from Texas.

Some time later, Jules is doing better in business working for his uncle when he reconnects with Nadine. She has married, but they initiate an affair. She has mental problems and shoots him. Jules survives, but has lost all his drive. Maureen has moved out and is working as a typist and taking night classes. She sets her sights on her professor, a married man, and they begin an affair. When Maureen coolly tells her mother of her plans to become a housewife, Loretta is incensed.

After his recovery, Jules is maintaining several affairs. He rapes a girl and later pimps her out. He also becomes involved with a group of intellectual radicals. He is present at the 1967 Detroit riots, when Loretta&#x27;s apartment is among the buildings burned. In the chaos, Jules commits murder.

Later, Jules visits Maureen, who has isolated herself from the rest of her family in Dearborn, Michigan with her husband and is expecting a child. Loretta is surviving, and Jules plans to try his fortunes in California.

==Reception==

Geoffrey Wolff wrote, &quot;This novel is a charnel house of Gothic paraphernalia: blood, fire, insanity, anarchy, lust, corruption, death by bullets, death by cancer, death by plane crash, death by stabbing, beatings, crime, riot and even unhappiness. Its ruling principles are hate and violence.&quot; Entela Kushta lamented, &quot;At the conclusion of the novel, the Wendall family is completely destroyed. Loretta has lost track of her children, and Maureen takes the final step toward removing herself from the old family by rejecting her own brother. Though they go on searching for love, Oates&#x27;s urban dwellers can find none...It is the multitudes of people and the continuous displacement of people which make familiarity impossible and withdrawal a likely defense.&quot; 

Susan Koppelman Cornillon wrote that &quot;one is uncertain, while reading the works of Miss Oates, whether or not she does, in fact, separate her own attitudes and opinions on the issue of sex role from her characters.&quot; She suggested, &quot;A writer can portray the unconscious perpetration of socialization on her characters without herself reinforcing the attitudes being internalized by her characters,&quot; but implied that Oates&#x27;s characters came across mostly as sexist stereotypes.

George Vecsey made a reference to the novel in his critique of baseball fans in 1985: &quot;I pointed ahead on Michigan Avenue to the old battleship-gray ballpark and said, &#x27;Them,&#x27; in the Joyce Carol Oates sense of the word. The problem with sports these days is the fans.&quot;

==Awards==
The novel won a National Book Award in 1970.

<doc id="496513" wikidata="Q1030951" url="?curid=496513" title="V (operating system)">
<text>The V operating system (sometimes written V-System) is a discontinued microkernel distributed operating system that was developed by faculty and students in the Distributed Systems Group at Stanford University from 1981 to 1988, led by Professors David Cheriton and Keith A. Lantz. V was the successor to the Thoth operating system and Verex kernel that Cheriton had developed in the 1970s. Despite similar names and close development dates, it is unrelated to UNIX System V.

==Features==
The key concepts in V are &quot;multithreading&quot; and &quot;synchronous message passing&quot;. The original V terminology uses &quot;process&quot; for what is now commonly called a &quot;thread&quot;, and &quot;team&quot; for what is now commonly called a &quot;process&quot; consisting of multiple threads sharing an address space. Communication between threads in V uses synchronous message passing, with short, fixed-length messages that can include access rights for the receiver to read or write part of the sender&#x27;s address space before replying. The same message-passing interface is used both between threads within one process, between threads of different processes within one machine, and between threads on different machines connected by a local Ethernet. A thread receiving a message is not required to reply to it before receiving other messages; this distinguished the model from Ada rendezvous. 

One common pattern for using the messaging facility is for clients to send messages to a server requesting some form of service. From the client side, this looks much like a remote procedure call (RPC). The convenience of an automatic stub generator was lacking, but in contrast, the client can pass one parameter by reference, which is not possible with other RPC implementations. From the server side the model differs more from RPC, since by default all client requests are multiplexed onto one server thread. The server is free to explicitly fork threads to handle client requests in parallel, however; if this is done, the server-side model is much like RPC too.

V was never an end in itself for the Stanford group; rather, it was used as a vehicle for many different research projects in distributed operating systems and networking. Much like other operating system efforts of its day (such as Sprite), V was a complete system that was mostly self hosting. Many students ran V as the only operating system on their diskless SUN workstations or MicroVAX workstations. Compiles could be done either on V, or on VAX Unix machines that provided file service in a more stable environment than the ever-changing research system.

V did have some notable impacts. After the initial implementation on one computer, the Versatile Message Transaction Protocol (VMTP) was developed to extend the send-receive-reply system call semantics over a local area network. 
The protocol included multicast support developed by Steve Deering as a graduate student in the group. The Internet Protocol layer to support this evolved into the IP multicast standard. 

The V-System was used for graphical user interface (GUI) research. The Virtual Graphics Terminal Service (VGTS) provided a modular windowing system for both local and remote applications. The little-known W Window System got its name because it was first hosted on the V operating system, and the better-known X Window System in turn got its name because its first version was based partly on W.

V also spawned another pure microkernel effort at Apple Computer known as Vanguard, which added a number of improvements to the basic system. Vanguard later disappeared in a reorganization.

The Tektronix VM700 television measurement instrument was developed in a networked V environment in the late 1980s and ran a lightly modified version of the V operating system; this device was manufactured and sold for many years. 

Ridge Computers&#x27; Ridge Operating System (ROS) was a commercial system based on Stanford&#x27;s V-System.

<doc id="496519" wikidata="Q202311" url="?curid=496519" title="Roman Egypt">
<text>Roman Egypt was an imperial province of the Roman Empire from 30 BC to AD 641. The province encompassed most of modern-day Egypt except for the Sinai. It was bordered by the provinces of Crete and Cyrenaica to the west and Judaea, later Arabia Petraea, to the East.

Egypt was conquered by Roman forces in 30 BC and became a province of the new Roman Empire upon its formation in 27 BC. Egypt came to serve as a major producer of grain for the empire and had a highly developed urban economy. It was by far the wealthiest Roman province outside of Italy. The population of Roman Egypt is unknown, although estimates vary from . Alexandria, its capital, was the largest port and second largest city of the Roman Empire.

Three Roman legions garrisoned Egypt in the early Roman imperial period, with the garrison later reduced to two, alongside formations of the Roman army. The major town of each &quot;nome&quot; (administrative region) was known as a metropolis and granted additional privileges. The inhabitants of Roman Egypt were divided by social class along ethnic and cultural lines. Most inhabitants were peasant farmers, who lived in rural villages and spoke the Egyptian language (which evolved from the Demotic Egyptian of the Late and Ptolemaic periods to Coptic under Roman rule). In each metropolis, the citizens spoke Koine Greek and followed a Hellenistic culture. However, there was considerable social mobility, increasing urbanization, and both the rural and urban population were involved in trade and had high literacy rates. In AD 212, the &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot; gave Roman citizenship to all free Egyptians.

The Antonine Plague struck in the late 2nd century, but Roman Egypt recovered by the 3rd century. Having escaped much of the Crisis of the Third Century, Roman Egypt fell under the control of the breakaway Palmyrene Empire after an invasion of Egypt by Zenobia in 269. The emperor Aurelian () successfully besieged Alexandria and recovered Egypt. The usurpers Domitius Domitianus and Achilleus took control of the province in opposition to emperor Diocletian (), who recovered it in 297–298. Diocletian then introduced administrative and economic reforms. These coincided with the Christianization of the Roman Empire, especially the growth of Christianity in Egypt. After Constantine the Great gained control of Egypt in AD 324, the emperors promoted Christianity. The Coptic language, derived from earlier forms of Egyptian, emerged among the Christians of Roman Egypt.

Under Diocletian the frontier was moved downriver to the First Cataract of the Nile at Syene (Aswan), withdrawing from the Dodekaschoinos region. This southern frontier was largely peaceful for many centuries, likely garrisoned by &quot;limitanei&quot; of the late Roman army. Regular units also served in Egypt, including Scythians known to have been stationed in the Thebaid by Justinian the Great (). Constantine introduced the gold &quot;solidus coin&quot;, which stabilized the economy. The trend towards private ownership of land became more pronounced in the 5th century and peaked in the 6th century, with large estates built up from many individual plots. Some large estates were owned by Christian churches, and smaller land-holders included those who were themselves both tenant farmers on larger estates and landlords of tenant-farmers working their own land. The First Plague Pandemic arrived in the Mediterranean Basin with the emergence of the Justinianic Plague at Pelusium in Roman Egypt in 541.

Egypt was conquered by the Sasanian Empire in 618, who ruled the territory for a decade, but it was returned to the Eastern Roman Empire by the defection of the governor in 628. Egypt permanently ceased to be a part of the Roman Empire in 641, when it became part of the Rashidun Caliphate following the Muslim conquest of Egypt.

== Formation ==

The Ptolemaic Kingdom (, the Thirty-first Dynasty) had ruled Egypt since the Wars of Alexander the Great that overthrew Achaemenid Egypt. The Ptolemaic pharaoh Cleopatra VII sided with Julius Caesar during Caesar&#x27;s Civil War (49–45 BC) and Caesar&#x27;s subsequent Roman dictatorship. After Caesar&#x27;s assassination in 44 BC, Cleopatra aligned Egypt with Mark Antony, the Roman triumvir who controlled the eastern Mediterranean. In the last war of the Roman Republic (32–30 BC), Antony (with Cleopatra&#x27;s support) fought against Octavian. The decisive naval Battle of Actium was won by Octavian, who then invaded Egypt. Following the Battle of Alexandria the defeated Antony and Cleopatra killed themselves. The Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt ceased to exist; Egypt was seized by Octavian as his personal possession.

The legal status was settled in 27 BC, when Octavian was granted the honorific name of Augustus and Egypt became an imperial province of the newly established Roman Empire. Augustus (and succeeding Roman emperors) ruled Egypt as the Roman pharaoh. The Ptolemaic institutions were dismantled: the government administration was wholly reformed, as was the social structure, though some bureaucratic elements were maintained. The Graeco-Egyptian legal system of the Hellenistic period continued in use, but within the bounds of Roman law. The tetradrachm coinage minted at the Ptolemaic capital of Alexandria continued to be the currency of an increasingly monetized economy, but its value was made equal to the Roman &quot;denarius&quot;. Augustus introduced land reforms that enabled wider entitlement to private ownership of land (previously rare under the Ptolemaic cleruchy system of allotments under royal ownership) and the local administration reformed into a Roman liturgical system, in which land-owners were required to serve in local government. The priesthoods of the Ancient Egyptian deities and Hellenistic religions of Egypt kept most of their temples and privileges, and in turn the priests also served the Roman imperial cult of the deified emperors and their families.

== Roman government in Egypt ==
As Rome overtook the Ptolemaic system in place for areas of Egypt, they made many changes. The effect of the Roman conquest was at first to strengthen the position of the Greeks and of Hellenism against Egyptian influences. Some of the previous offices and names of offices under the Hellenistic Ptolemaic rule were kept, some were changed, and some names would have remained but the function and administration would have changed.

The Romans introduced important changes in the administrative system, aimed at achieving a high level of efficiency and maximizing revenue. The duties of the prefect of Aegyptus combined responsibility for military security through command of the legions and cohorts, for the organization of finance and taxation, and for the administration of justice.

The Egyptian provinces of the Ptolemaic Kingdom remained wholly under Roman rule until the administrative reforms of the &quot;augustus&quot; Diocletian (). In these first three centuries of Roman Egypt, the whole country came under the central Roman control of single governor, officially called in and more usually referred to as the or the . The double title of the governor as prefect &quot;of Alexandria and Egypt&quot; reflects the distinctions between Upper and Lower Egypt and Alexandria, since Alexandria, outside the Nile Delta, was not within the then-prevailing traditional geographic boundaries of Egypt.

From the 1st century BC, the Roman governor of Egypt was appointed by the emperor for a multi-year term and given the rank of prefect (). Both the governor and the major officials were of equestrian rank (unlike other Roman provinces, which had governors of senatorial rank). The prefect of Egypt had more or less equivalent civil and military powers (&quot;imperium&quot;) to a proconsul, since a Roman law (a ) granted him &quot;proconsular &quot;imperium&quot;&quot; (). Unlike in senatorial provinces, the prefect was responsible for the collection of certain taxes and for the organization of the all-important grain shipments from Egypt (including the &quot;annona&quot;). Because of these financial responsibilities, the governor&#x27;s administration had to be closely controlled and organized. The governorship of Egypt was the second-highest office available to the equestrian class on the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; (after that of the praetorian prefect (), the commander of the imperial Praetorian Guard) and one of the highest-paid, receiving an annual salary of 200,000 &quot;sesterces&quot; (a &quot;ducenarian&quot; post). The prefect was appointed at the emperor&#x27;s discretion; officially the governors&#x27; status and responsibilities mirrored those of the &quot;augustus&quot; himself: his fairness () and his foresight (). From the early 2nd century, service as the governor of Egypt was frequently the penultimate stage in the career of a praetorian prefect.

The governor&#x27;s powers as prefect, which included the rights to make edicts () and, as the supreme judicial authority, to order capital punishment (), expired as soon as his successor arrived in the provincial capital at Alexandria, who then also took up overall command of the Roman legions of the Egyptian garrison. (Initially, three legions were stationed in Egypt, with only two from the reign of Tiberius ().) The official duties of the &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot; are well known because enough records survive to reconstruct a mostly complete official calendar (&quot;fasti&quot;) of the governors&#x27; engagements. Yearly in Lower Egypt, and once every two years in Upper Egypt, the &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot; held a &quot;conventus&quot; (), during which legal trials were conducted and administrative officials&#x27; practices were examined, usually between January (&quot;Ianuarius&quot;) and April (&quot;Aprilis&quot;) in the Roman calendar. Evidence exists of more than 60 edicts issued by the Roman governors of Egypt.

To the government at Alexandria besides the prefect of Egypt, the Roman emperors appointed several other subordinate procurators for the province, all of equestrian rank and, at least from the reign of Commodus () of similar, &quot;ducenarian&quot; salary bracket. The administrator of the &quot;Idios Logos&quot;, responsible for special revenues like the proceeds of &quot;bona caduca&quot; property, and the &quot;iuridicus&quot; (), the senior legal official, were both imperially appointed. From the reign of Hadrian (), the financial powers of the prefect and the control of the Egyptian temples and priesthoods was devolved to other procurators, a &quot;dioiketes&quot; (), the chief financial officer, and an &quot;archiereus&quot; (). A procurator could deputize as the prefect&#x27;s representative where necessary.

Procurators were also appointed from among the freedmen (manumitted slaves) of the imperial household, including the powerful , responsible for state property in the province. Other procurators were responsible for revenue farming of state monopolies (the ), oversight of farm lands (the ), of the warehouses of Alexandria (the ), and of exports and emigration (the ). These roles are poorly attested, with often the only surviving information beyond the names of the offices is a few names of the incumbents. In general, the central provincial administration of Egypt is no better-known than the Roman governments of other provinces, since, unlike in the rest of Egypt, the conditions for the preservation of official papyri were very unfavourable at Alexandria.

Local government in the hinterland () outside Alexandria was divided into traditional regions known as &quot;nomoi&quot;. The &quot;mētropoleis&quot; were governed by magistrates drawn from the liturgy system; these magistrates, as in other Roman cities, practised euergetism and built public buildings. To each &quot;nome&quot; the prefect appointed a &quot;strategos&quot; (); the &quot;strategoi&quot; were civilian administrators, without military functions, who performed much of the government of the country in the prefect&#x27;s name and were themselves drawn from the Egyptian upper classes. The &quot;strategoi&quot; in each of the &quot;mētropoleis&quot; were the senior local officials, served as intermediaries between the prefect and the villages, and were legally responsible for the administration and their own conduct while in office for several years. Each &quot;strategos&quot; was supplemented by a royal scribe (). These scribes were responsible for their &quot;nome&quot;&#x27;s financial affairs, including administration of all property, land, land revenues, and temples, and what remains of their record-keeping is unparalleled in the ancient world for its completeness and complexity. The royal scribes could act as proxy for the , but each reported directly to Alexandria, where dedicated financial secretaries – appointed for each individual &quot;nome&quot; – oversaw the accounts: an and a . The was responsible for general financial affairs while the likely dealt with matters relating to the &quot;Idios Logos&quot;. In 200/201, the emperor Septimius Severus () granted each metropolis, and the city of Alexandria, a &quot;boulē&quot; (a Hellenistic town council).

The &quot;nomoi&quot; were grouped traditionally into those of Upper and Lower Egypt, the two divisions each being known as an &quot;epistrategy&quot; after the chief officer, the &quot;epistrategos&quot; (), each of whom was also a Roman procurator. Soon after the Roman annexation, a new epistrategy was formed, encompassing the area just south of Memphis and the Faiyum region and named &quot;the Heptanomia and the Arsinoite nome&quot;. In the Nile Delta however, power was wielded by two of the &quot;epistrategoi&quot;. The &quot;epistrategos&quot;&#x27;s role was mainly to mediate between the prefect in Alexandria and the &quot;strategoi&quot; in the &quot;mētropoleis&quot;, and they had few specific administrative duties, performing a more general function. Their salary was sexagenarian – 60,000 sesterces annually.

Each village or &quot;kome&quot; () was served by a village scribe (), whose term, possibly paid, was usually held for three years. Each, to avoid conflicts of interest, was appointed to a community away from their home village, as they were required to inform the &quot;strategoi&quot; and &quot;epistrategoi&quot; of the names of persons due to perform unpaid public service as part of the liturgy system. They were required to be literate and had various duties as official clerks. Other local officials drawn from the liturgy system served for a year in their home &quot;kome&quot;; they included the &quot;practor&quot; (), who collected certain taxes, as well as security officers, granary officials (), public cattle drivers (), and cargo supervisors (). Other liturgical officials were responsible for other specific aspects of the economy: a suite of officials was each responsible for arranging supplies of particular necessity in the course of the prefect&#x27;s official tours. The liturgy system extended to most aspects of Roman administration by the reign of Trajan (), though constant efforts were made by people eligible for such duties to escape their imposition.

The reforms of the early 4th century had established the basis for another 250 years of comparative prosperity in Aegyptus, at a cost of perhaps greater rigidity and more oppressive state control. Aegyptus was subdivided for administrative purposes into a number of smaller provinces, and separate civil and military officials were established; the praeses and the dux. The province was under the supervision of the count of the Orient (i.e. the vicar) of the diocese headquartered in Antioch in Syria.

Emperor Justinian abolished the Diocese of Egypt in 538 and re-combined civil and military power in the hands of the &quot;dux&quot; with a civil deputy (&quot;praeses&quot;) as a counterweight to the power of the church authorities. All pretense of local autonomy had by then vanished. The presence of the soldiery was more noticeable, its power and influence more pervasive in the routine of town and village life.

== Military ==

The Roman army was among the most homogenous Roman structures, and the organization of the army in Egypt differed little from its organization elsewhere in the Roman Empire. The Roman legions were recruited from Roman citizens and the Roman &quot;auxilia&quot; recruited from the non-citizen subjects.

Egypt was unique in that its garrison was commanded by the &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot;, an official of the equestrian order, rather than, as in other provinces, a governor of the senatorial class. This distinction was stipulated in a law promulgated by Augustus, and, because it was unthinkable that an equestrian should command a senator, the commanders of the legions in Egypt were themselves, uniquely, of equestrian rank. As a result of these strictures, the governor was rendered unable to build up a rival power base (as Mark Antony had been able to do), while the military &quot;legati&quot; commanding the legions were career soldiers, formerly centurions with the senior rank of &quot;primus pilus&quot;, rather than politicians whose military experience was limited to youthful service as a military tribune. Beneath the &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot;, the overall commander of legions and stationed in Egypt was styled in , from the , or as . Collectively, these forces were known as the .

The Roman garrison was concentrated at Nicopolis, a district of Alexandria, rather than at the strategic heart of the country around Memphis and Egyptian Babylon. Alexandria was the Mediterranean&#x27;s second city in the early Roman empire, the cultural capital of the Greek East and rival to Rome under Antony and Cleopatra. Because only a few papyri are preserved from the area, little more is known about the legionaries&#x27; everyday life than is known from other provinces of the empire, and little evidence exists of the military practices of the prefect and his officers. Most papyri have been found in Middle Egypt&#x27;s villages, and the texts are primarily concerned with local affairs, rarely giving space to high politics and military matters. Not much is known about the military encampments of the Roman imperial period, since many are underwater or have been built over and because Egyptian archaeology has traditionally taken little interest in Roman sites. Because they supply a record of soldiers&#x27; service history, six bronze Roman military diplomas dating between 83 and 206 are the main source of documentary evidence for the in Egypt; these inscribed certificates rewarded 25 or 26 years of military service in the with Roman citizenship and the right of &quot;conubium&quot;. That the army was more Greek-speaking than in other provinces is certain.

The heart of the Army of Egypt was the Nicopolis garrison at Alexandria, with at least one legion permanently stationed there, along with a strong force of cavalry. These troops would both guard the residence of the against uprisings among the Alexandrians and were poised to march quickly to any point at the prefect&#x27;s command. At Alexandria too was the , the provincial fleet of the Roman Navy in Egypt. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries, there were around 8,000 soldiers at Alexandria, a fraction of the megalopolis&#x27;s huge population.

Initially, the legionary garrison of Roman Egypt consisted of three legions: the &quot;Legio III Cyrenaica&quot;, the &quot;Legio XXII Deiotariana&quot;, and one other legion. The station and identity of this third legion is not known for sure, and it is not known precisely when it was withdrawn from Egypt, though it was certainly before 23 AD, during the reign of Tiberius (). In the reign of Tiberius&#x27;s step-father and predecessor Augustus, the legions had been stationed at Nicopolis and at Egyptian Babylon, and perhaps at Thebes. After August 119, the &quot;III Cyrenaica&quot; was ordered out of Egypt; the &quot;XXII Deiotariana&quot; was transferred sometime afterwards, and before 127/8, the &quot;Legio II Traiana&quot; arrived, to remain as the main component of the Army of Egypt for two centuries.

After some fluctuations in the size and positions of the garrison in the early decades of Roman Egypt, relating to the conquest and pacification of the country, the contingent was mostly stable during the Principate, increasing somewhat towards the end of the 2nd century, and with some individual formations remaining in Egypt for centuries at a time. Three or four &quot;alae&quot; of cavalry were stationed in Egypt, each &quot;ala&quot; numbering around 500 horsemen. There were between seven and ten &quot;cohortes&quot; of infantry, each &quot;cohors&quot; about 500 strong, although some were &quot;cohortes equitatae&quot; – mixed units of 600 men, with infantry and cavalry in a roughly 4:1 ratio. Besides the stationed at Alexandria, at least three detachments permanently garrisoned the southern border, on the Nile&#x27;s First Cataract around Philae and Syene (Aswan), protecting Egypt from enemies to the south and guarding against rebellion in the Thebaid.

Besides the main garrison at Alexandrian Nicopolis and the southern border force, the disposition of the rest of the Army of Egypt is not clear, though many soldiers are known to have been stationed at various outposts (), including those defending roads and remote natural resources from attack. Roman detachments, &quot;centuriones&quot;, and &quot;beneficiarii&quot; maintained order in the Nile Valley, but about their duties little is known, as little evidence survives, though they were, in addition to the &quot;strategoi&quot; of the &quot;nomoi&quot;, the prime local representatives of the Roman state. Archaeological work led by Hélène Cuvigny has revealed many &quot;ostraca&quot; (inscribed ceramic fragments) which give unprecedently detailed information on the lives of soldiers stationed in the Eastern Desert along the Coptos–Myos Hormos road and at the imperial granite quarry at &quot;Mons Claudianus&quot;. Another Roman outpost, known from an inscription, existed on Farasan, the chief island of the Red Sea&#x27;s Farasan Islands off the west coast of the Arabian Peninsula.

As in other provinces, many of the Roman soldiers in Egypt were recruited locally, not only among the non-citizen , but among the legionaries as well, who were required to have Roman citizenship. An increasing proportion of the Army of Egypt was of local origin in the reign of the Flavian dynasty, with an even higher proportion – as many as three quarters of legionaries – under the Severan dynasty. Of these, around one third were themselves the offspring () of soldiers, raised in the &quot;canabae&quot; settlements surrounding the army&#x27;s base at Nicopolis, while only about one eighth were Alexandrian citizens. Egyptians were given Roman-style Latin names on joining the army; unlike in other provinces, indigenous names are nearly unknown among the local soldiers of the Army of Egypt.

One of the surviving military diplomas lists the soldier&#x27;s birthplace as Coptos, while others demonstrate that soldiers and centurions from elsewhere retired to Egypt: veterans from Chios and Hippo Regius (or Hippos) are named. Evidence from the 2nd century suggests most came from Egypt, with others drawn from the provinces of &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Syria&quot;, and from Roman Asia Minor. from the Balkans, who served throughout the Roman army, also served in Egypt: many Dacian names are known from &quot;ostraca&quot; in the Trajanic period, perhaps connected with the recruitment of Dacians during and after Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars; they are predominantly cavalrymen&#x27;s names, with some infantrymen&#x27;s. Thracians, common in the army in other Roman provinces, were also present, and an auxiliary diploma from the Egyptian garrison has been found in Thracia. Two diplomas connect Army of Egypt veterans with Syria, including one naming Apamea. Large numbers of recruits mustered in Asia Minor may have supplemented the garrison after the Diaspora Revolt, a Jewish uprising in Egypt, Libya and Cyprus.

== Society ==
The social structure in Aegyptus under the Romans was both unique and complicated. On the one hand, the Romans continued to use many of the same organizational tactics that were in place under the leaders of the Ptolemaic period. At the same time, the Romans saw the Greeks in Aegyptus as &quot;Egyptians&quot;, an idea that both the native Egyptians and Greeks would have rejected. To further compound the whole situation, Jews, who themselves were very Hellenized overall, had their own communities, separate from both Greeks and native Egyptians.

Most inhabitants were peasants, many working as tenant-farmers for high rents in kind, cultivating sacred land belonging to temples or public land formerly belonging to the Egyptian monarchy. The division between the rural life of the villages, where the Egyptian language was spoken, and the metropolis, where the citizens spoke Koine Greek and frequented the Hellenistic &quot;gymnasia&quot;, was the most significant cultural division in Roman Egypt, and was not dissolved by the &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot; of 212, which made all free Egyptians Roman citizens. There was considerable social mobility however, accompanying mass urbanization, and participation in the monetized economy and literacy in Greek by the peasant population was widespread.

The Romans began a system of social hierarchy that revolved around ethnicity and place of residence. Other than Roman citizens, a Greek citizen of one of the Greek cities had the highest status, and a rural Egyptian would be in the lowest class. In between those classes was the metropolite, who was almost certainly of Hellenic origin. Gaining citizenship and moving up in ranks was very difficult and there were not many available options for ascendancy.

One of the routes that many followed to ascend to another caste was through enlistment in the army. Although only Roman citizens could serve in the legions, many Greeks found their way in. The native Egyptians could join the auxiliary forces and attain citizenship upon discharge. The different groups had different rates of taxation based on their social class. Roman citizens and citizens of Alexandria were exempted from the poll tax. Hellenized inhabitants of the nome capitals paid a low rate of poll tax, while native Egyptians paid a higher rate. Native Egyptians were barred from serving in the army, and there were other defined legal distinctions between the classes. Within the &quot;mētropoleis&quot; there was a Hellenic socio-political élite, an urban land-owning aristocracy that dominated Egypt by the 2nd and throughout the 3rd centuries through their large private estates.

The social structure in Aegyptus is very closely linked to the governing administration. Elements of centralized rule that were derived from the Ptolemaic period lasted into the 4th century. One element in particular was the appointment of strategoi to govern the &#x27;nomes&#x27;, the traditional administrative divisions of Egypt. Boulai, or town councils, in Egypt were only formally constituted by Septimius Severus. It was only under Diocletian later in the 3rd century that these boulai and their officers acquired important administrative responsibilities for their nomes. The Augustan takeover introduced a system of compulsory public service, which was based on &quot;poros&quot; (property or income qualification), which was wholly based on social status and power. The Romans also introduced the poll tax which was similar to tax rates that the Ptolemies levied, but the Romans gave special low rates to citizens of &quot;mētropoleis&quot;. The city of Oxyrhynchus had many papyri remains that contain much information on the subject of social structure in these cities. This city, along with Alexandria, shows the diverse set-up of various institutions that the Romans continued to use after their takeover of Egypt.

Just as under the Ptolemies, Alexandria and its citizens had their own special designations. The capital city enjoyed a higher status and more privileges than the rest of Egypt. Just as it was under the Ptolemies, the primary way of becoming a citizen of Roman Alexandria was through showing when registering for a deme that both parents were Alexandrian citizens. Alexandrians were the only Egyptians that could obtain Roman citizenship.
If a common Egyptian wanted to become a Roman citizen he would first have to become an Alexandrian citizen. The Augustan period in Egypt saw the creation of urban communities with &quot;Hellenic&quot; landowning elites. These landowning elites were put in a position of privilege and power and had more self-administration than the Egyptian population. Within the citizenry, there were gymnasiums that Greek citizens could enter if they showed that both parents were members of the gymnasium based on a list that was compiled by the government in 4–5 AD.

The candidate for the gymnasium would then be let into the ephebus. There was also the council of elders known as the gerousia. This council of elders did not have a boulai to answer to. All of this Greek organization was a vital part of the metropolis and the Greek institutions provided an elite group of citizens. The Romans looked to these elites to provide municipal officers and well-educated administrators. These elites also paid lower poll-taxes than the local native Egyptians, fellahin. It is well documented that Alexandrians in particular were exempted from paying poll-taxes, and were able to enjoy lower tax-rates on land. Egyptian landholders paid about 3 times more than the elites per aroura of land in tax-rates, and about 4–5 times more than Alexandrians per aroura of land in tax-rates.

These privileges even extended to corporal punishments. Romans were protected from this type of punishment while native Egyptians were whipped. Alexandrians, on the other hand, had the privilege of merely being beaten with a rod. Although Alexandria enjoyed the greatest status of the Greek cities in Egypt, it is clear that the other Greek cities, such as Antinoöpolis, enjoyed privileges very similar to the ones seen in Alexandria; for instance, like Alexandrians, Antinoöpolites were exempted from paying poll-taxes. All of these changes amounted to the Greeks being treated as an ally in Egypt and the native Egyptians were treated as a conquered race.

The &quot;Gnomon of the Idios Logos&quot; shows the connection between law and status. It lays out the revenues it deals with, mainly fines and confiscation of property, to which only a few groups were apt. The Gnomon also confirms that a freed slave takes his former master&#x27;s social status. The &quot;Gnomon&quot; demonstrates the social controls that the Romans had in place through monetary means based on status and property.

== Economy ==

The economic resources that this imperial government existed to exploit had not changed since the Ptolemaic period, but the development of a much more complex and sophisticated taxation system was a hallmark of Roman rule. Taxes in both cash and kind were assessed on land, and a bewildering variety of small taxes in cash, as well as customs dues and the like, was collected by appointed officials.

A massive amount of Aegyptus&#x27; grain was shipped downriver (north) both to feed the population of Alexandria and for export to the Roman capital. There were frequent complaints of oppression and extortion from the taxpayers.

For land management and tenure, the Ptolemaic state had retained much of the categorization of land as under the earlier pharaohs, but the Roman Empire introduced a distinction between private and public lands – the earlier system had categorized little land as private property – and a complex arrangement was developed consisting of dozens of types of land-holding. Land&#x27;s status was determined by the hydrological, juridical, and function of the property, as well as by the three main categories of ownership held over from the Ptolemaic system: the sacred property belonging to the temples (); the royal land () belonging to the state and forming most of its revenue; and the &quot;gifted land&quot; (; ) leased out under the cleruchy system.
The Roman government had actively encouraged the privatization of land and the increase of private enterprise in manufacture, commerce, and trade, and low tax rates favored private owners and entrepreneurs. The poorer people gained their livelihood as tenants of state-owned land or of property belonging to the emperor or to wealthy private landlords, and they were relatively much more heavily burdened by rentals, which tended to remain at a fairly high level.

Overall, the degree of monetization and complexity in the economy, even at the village level, was intense. Goods were moved around and exchanged through the medium of coin on a large scale and, in the towns and the larger villages, a high level of industrial and commercial activity developed in close conjunction with the exploitation of the predominant agricultural base. The volume of trade, both internal and external, reached its peak in the 1st and 2nd centuries.
By the end of the 3rd century, major problems were evident. A series of debasements of the imperial currency had undermined confidence in the coinage, and even the government itself was contributing to this by demanding more and more irregular tax payments in kind, which it channelled directly to the main consumers, the army personnel. Local administration by the councils was careless, recalcitrant, and inefficient; the evident need for firm and purposeful reform had to be squarely faced in the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I.

There are numerous indications of Roman trade with India during the period, particularly between Roman Egypt and the Indian subcontinent. Kushan Empire ruler Huvishka (150–180 CE) incorporated in his coins the Hellenistic-Egyptian god Serapis (under the name &quot;ϹΑΡΑΠΟ&quot;, &quot;Sarapo&quot;). Since Serapis was the supreme deity of the pantheon of Alexandria in Egypt, this coin suggests that Huvishka had as strong orientation towards Roman Egypt, which may have been an important market for the products coming from the Kushan Empire.

== Architecture ==

In the administrative provincial capitals of the &quot;nomoi&quot;, the &quot;mētropoleis&quot; mostly inherited from the Pharaonic and Ptolemaic period, Roman public buildings were erected by the governing &quot;strategos&quot; and the local gymnasiarch. In most cases, these have not survived and evidence of them is rare, but it is probable that most were built in the classical architecture of the Graeco-Roman world, employing the classical orders in stone buildings. Prominent remains include two Roman theatres at Pelusium, a temple of Serapis and a tetrastyle at Diospolis Magna at Thebes, and, at Philae, a triumphal arch and temples dedicated to the worship of the emperor Augustus and the goddess Roma, the personification of Rome. Besides a few individual stone blocks in some &quot;mētropoleis&quot;, substantial remains of Roman architecture are known in particular from three of the &quot;mētropoleis&quot; – Heracleopolis Magna, Oxyrhynchus, and Hermopolis Magna – as well as from Antinoöpolis, a city founded by the emperor Hadrian (). All these were sacred cities dedicated to particular deities. The ruins of these cities were first methodically surveyed and sketched by intellectuals attached to Napoleon&#x27;s campaign in Egypt, eventually published in the &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot; series. Illustrations produced by Edme-François Jomard and Vivant Denon form much of the evidence of these remains, because since the 19th century many of the ruins have themselves disappeared. South of Thebes, the &quot;mētropoleis&quot; may have been largely without classical buildings, but near Antinoöpolis the classical influence may have been stronger. Most &quot;mētropoleis&quot; were probably built on the classical Hippodamian grid employed by the Hellenistic &quot;polis&quot;, as at Alexandria, with the typical Roman pattern of the &quot;Cardo&quot; (north–south) and &quot;Decumanus Maximus&quot; (east–west) thoroughfares meeting at their centres, as at Athribis and Antinoöpolis.

Vivant Denon made sketches of ruins at Oxyrhynchus, and Edme-François Jomard wrote a description; together with some historical photographs and the few surviving remains, these are the best evidence for the classical architecture of the city, which was dedicated to the &quot;medjed&quot;, a sacred species of &quot;Mormyrus&quot; fish. Two groups of buildings survive at Heracleopolis Magna, sacred to Heracles/Hercules, which is otherwise known from Jomard&#x27;s work, which also forms the mainstay of knowledge about the architecture of Antinoöpolis, founded by Hadrian in honour of his deified lover Antinous. The Napoleonic-era evidence is also important for documenting Hermopolis Magna, where more buildings survive and which was dedicated to the worship of Thoth, equated with Hermes/Mercury.

The oldest known remains of church architecture in Egypt are at the Roman village of Kellis; following the house church of the early 4th century, a three-aisled, apsed basilica church was built in the Constantinian period, with &quot;pastaphoria&quot; on either side, while a third church was accompanied by a Christian cemetery. All these churches were built on an east–west axis, with the liturgical focus at the east, and the &quot;pastaphoria&quot; (side-rooms) were a common mark of churches in the country. Churches were built quickly after the victory of Constantine over Licinius, and in the 4th century even towns like ‘Ain el-Gedida in the Dakhla Oasis had their own churches. The earliest known monumental basilica of which remains survive is that at Antinoöpolis; a five-aisled, apsed basilica facing east and set in a cemetery is long and wide.

In the late 4th century, monastic churches differed from the other churches by building rectangular sanctuaries – rather than semi-circular ones – at their east ends where the altar stood, and in place of the apse was an aedicula or niche embellished with an arch and columns in applied in plaster. In the 5th century, regional styles of monumental church basilica with &quot;pastaphoria&quot; emerged: on the coast of the Mediterranean and throughout the northern part of the country the churches were basilicas of three or five aisles, but in Middle Egypt and Upper Egypt the basilicas were often given a colonnade all the way around the structure, forming a continuous ambulatory by the addition of a transverse fourth aisle to the west of the other three. In eastern Egypt, the columns and colonnade were emphasized, and the sanctuary distinguished with a triumphal arch in front of it.

A transept plan was adopted only in urban environments like Abu Mena and Marea in the western Nile Delta. In the middle 5th century, the Great Basilica, one of the largest churches in Egypt, was built at Hermopolis Magna at the central crossroads of the city. Unusually, the three-aisled transept basilica had semicircular extensions on the north and south walls. At the Coptic White Monastery at Sohag, the 5th-century church was built with a triconch apse, an unusual design also found at Sohag&#x27;s Dayr Anbā Bishoi; in the Wadi El Natrun at Dayr as-Suyrān; in the Dakhla Oasis in the Western Desert at Dayr Abū Mattā, and at Dendera. The tomb-chapel of the White Monastery&#x27;s founder, Shenoute, was also built with this triconch plan and was the first instance of a monastic founder&#x27;s tomb built in a monastery. Some of the White Monastery&#x27;s limestone ashlars were &quot;spolia&quot;; the stones were likely taken from the pharaonic buildings at Upper Egyptian Athribis nearby. The main church&#x27;s interior is a three-aisled basilica with an ambon and seat, and the usual Egyptian western transverse aisle, but its exterior resembles an Egyptian temple, with cavetto cornices on the roof. Unusually for the Coptic churches, the White Monastery&#x27;s church has two narthexes, perhaps to accommodate worshippers from outside the monastic community. The affiliated Red Monastery nearby preserves the most extensive painted decoration from Late Antiquity anywhere and is probably representative of the period&#x27;s Egyptian churches&#x27; interior decoration. Besides the main monumental basilica at Antinoöpolis, there were two other cruciform churches built there in the later 5th century.

== Religion ==
=== Imperial cult ===
The worship of Egypt&#x27;s rulers was interrupted entirely by the fall of the Ptolemaic dynasty, who together with their predecessor Alexander the Great had been worshipped with an Egypto-Hellenistic ruler cult. After the Roman conquest of Egypt, Augustus instituted a new Roman imperial cult in Egypt. Formally, the &quot;Roman people&quot; () were now collectively the ruler of Egypt; emperors were never crowned pharaoh in person in the traditional way, and there is no evidence that the emperors were systematically incorporated into the traditional pantheons worshipped by the traditional priesthoods. Instead, the image of Augustus was identified with Zeus &quot;Eleutherios&quot; (), and modelled on the example of Alexander the Great, who was said to have &quot;liberated&quot; Egypt from the old pharaohs. Nevertheless, in 27 BC there was at Memphis, as was traditional, a high priest of Ptah appointed under Augustus&#x27;s authority as the senior celebrant of the Egyptian ruler cult and referred to as a &quot;priest of Caesar&quot;. Augustus had been honoured with a cult in Egypt before his death, and there is evidence that Nero was worshipped while still living, as was Hadrian in particular. While alive however, the emperor was usually honoured with offerings to the various gods &quot;for his health&quot; (); usually, only after the emperor&#x27;s death was he deified and worshipped as a god. A letter of Claudius written to the Alexandrians in 41 AD rejects the offer of a cult of himself, permitting only divine honours such as statues and reserving cult worship for the deified Augustus. For juridical purposes, the imperial oath recalling Ptolemaic precedent had to be sworn in the name or &quot;fortune&quot; (&quot;tyche&quot;) of the emperor: &quot;I swear by Caesar Imperator, son of God, Zeus &quot;Eleutherios&quot;, Augustus&quot;.

The official cult was superintended by the &quot;archiereus&quot; for Alexandria and All Egypt (), who was procurator in charge of Egypt&#x27;s temples and responsible for the worship of the imperial deities and of Serapis throughout the country. As with the &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot;, the &quot;archiereus&quot; of Alexandria and All Egypt was a Roman citizen and probably appointed from the equestrian class. The official cult in Egypt differed from that in other provinces; the goddess Roma, closely associated with the Roman Senate, was not introduced by Augustus, since as an imperial province Egypt lay beyond the reach of the Senate&#x27;s powers (&quot;imperium&quot;). The &quot;archiereus&quot; for Alexandria and All Egypt was appointed by the emperor. The high priest&#x27;s full title (&quot;high priest of the gods &quot;Augusti&quot; and the Great Serapis and the one who is responsible for the temples of Egypt and the whole country&quot;) indicates that the cult of Serapis was closely connected with the worship of the emperors and that both were overseen by the same Roman official.
An &quot;archiereus&quot; existed in each of the &quot;nomoi&quot;; drawn from the local elite through the liturgy system, these high priests were responsible for the maintenance of the imperial temples and cults in their &quot;mētropoleis&quot;. These officials, in place since the mid-1st century AD at latest, was each known as the &quot;high priest of the Lords &quot;Augusti&quot; and all the gods&quot; () or the &quot;high priest of the city&quot; (), and was responsible mainly for the organization of the imperial cult, since the traditional local cults already had their own priesthoods. Though imposed by the Roman state and overseen from the provincial capital, the imperial cult was locally organized, though direct imperial control is also attested for the cult at Alexandria. Throughout Egypt, sacrificial altars dedicated to the worship of the deified emperor Augustus () were set up in dedicated temples (&quot;sebasteia&quot; or &quot;caesarea&quot;). Each &quot;sebasteion&quot; or &quot;caesareum&quot; had administrative functions as well as organizing the local cult of the emperor. Nevertheless, there is scant evidence that the worship of the emperors was common in private settings, and the Alexandrians were frequently hostile to the emperors themselves.

The form of the imperial cult established in the reign of Augustus, which may have been largely focused on the deified first emperor himself, continued until the reign of Constantine the Great. The widow of the emperor Trajan, the &quot;augusta&quot; Plotina, was deified after her death by Hadrian. At Dendera, in a temple dedicated to Aphrodite, the late empress was identified with the Egyptian goddess Hathor, the first instance of a member of the imperial family – besides the emperor himself – being integrated into the Egyptian pantheon. Unlike the royal cult of the Ptolemaic dynasty, whose festivals were celebrated according to the Egyptian calendar, the imperial cult days, such as the emperors&#x27; birthdays (), fell according to the Roman calendar.

=== Cult of Serapis and Isis ===
Serapis was a syncretic god of abundance and the afterlife which united Hellenistic and Egyptian features and which had been instituted by Ptolemy I &quot;Soter&quot; () at the beginning of the Ptolemaic period, possibly related to the cult of Osiris-Apis. Serapis assumed the role of Osiris in the Egyptian pantheon as god of the afterlife and regeneration, the husband of the fertility goddess Isis, and the father of the child Horus, known to the Hellenistic world as Harpocrates. Emperors were sometimes depicted as Serapis, with their portraits bearing Serapis&#x27;s distinguishing features, who, unlike most native Egyptian gods but in common with Osiris, was never depicted in animal or part-animal form. Caracalla took the title &quot;Philosarapis&quot; to indicate his devotion to the cult. Serapis was distinguished by his Greek-style clothes, long hair, and beard, as well as by his flat-topped crown, known as a &quot;calathus&quot;. The Mysteries of Isis, a mystery cult developed outside Egypt and reimported to the country from Roman territories elsewhere, were increasingly celebrated, and Isis was the supreme female deity and creator-goddess in the pantheon, incorporating the Ptolemaic queen-worship tradition. As Isis , she was an image of motherhood, feeding her infant Harpocrates; as Isis , she was a goddess of magic and mysteries.

In Roman Egypt, the cult was superintended by the &quot;archiereus&quot; for Alexandria and All Egypt. Temples of Serapis (serapea) were found throughout Egypt, with the oldest serapeum at Memphis and the greatest the Serapeum of Alexandria. The holy family of Serapis, Isis, and Harpocrates was worshipped throughout the empire; by the 4th century, the cult had become, behind Christianity, the most popular religion in the Roman world.

=== Temples ===
The imperially-appointed &quot;archiereus&quot; for Alexandria and All Egypt was responsible for the administrative management of the temples, beyond those of the imperial cult, dedicated to Graeco-Roman deities and the ancient Egyptian gods. He controlled access to the priesthoods of the Egyptian cults: the ritual circumcision of candidates was subject to his approval and he mediated disputes involving temples, wielding some judicial powers. As sponsors of temple cults, emperors appeared in traditional pharaonic regalia on carved temple reliefs. Similarly, Egyptian gods were sometimes shown wearing Roman military garb, particularly Anubis and Horus.

The history of Egyptian temples in Roman times can be studied particularly well in some settlements at the edges of the Faiyum: Archaeological evidence, along with lots of written sources on the daily life of the priests, are available from Bakchias, Narmouthis, Soknopaiou Nesos, Tebtunis, and Theadelphia. For instance, temples can be seen supporting each other by asking colleagues to assist when there was a shortage of staff, but also competing with each other for spheres of influence. When temples came into conflict with authorities, then mainly with lower administrative officials, who belonged to the local population themselves; the Roman procurators intervened in these conflicts, if at all, then in a moderating manner.
The Julio-Claudian emperors Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero all sponsored religious monuments and institutions at Coptos and Dendera. Tiberius is known to have patronized monuments at Armant, Aswan, Athribis, Debod, Diospolis Parva, Edfu, Karnak, Kom Ombo, Luxor, Philae and at the Temple of Shenhur. Claudius&#x27;s patronage is recorded at Aswan, Athribis, Esna, Kom Ombo, and at Philae. Nero is recorded as having sponsored Egyptian elites at the Dakhla Oasis in the Western Desert, and at Karanis and Akoris, as well as at Aswan and Kom Ombo. During the short reigns of Galba and of the contestants in the Year of the Four Emperors after the fall of Nero, images of both Otho and Galba were carved in reliefs at Medinet Habu, a Pharaonic temple dating from the Eighteenth Dynasty, but no monuments to Vitellius are known.

The Flavian emperors Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian are all known to have been responsible for works at Esna. Both Vespasian and his older son Titus sponsored work at the Dakhla Oasis, with Vespasian also the sponsor of work at Medinet Habu. Vespasian and his younger son Domitian were both credited with patronage of works at Kom Ombo and Silsila, and Domitian&#x27;s sponsorship was also recorded at Akhmim, Armant, Dendera, and Philae. 185 scenes in many temples show Domitian, concentrated in the oases and in Upper Egypt; his name was in some places removed as a result of his &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;.After Domitian&#x27;s assassination, the emperor Nerva&#x27;s patronage of Egyptian temples is recorded only at Esna. Nerva&#x27;s adoptive heir Trajan continued to lend imperial sponsorship to Egyptian cults, with his patronage recorded at Dendera, Esna, Gebelein, Kalabsha, Kom Ombo, Medinet Habu, and Philae. During Hadrian&#x27;s tour of Egypt in 130–131, the emperor founded the new Hellenistic &quot;polis&quot; of Antinoöpolis at the point where Antinous drowned in the Nile and instituted a cult of Antinous as Osiris, to whom a death by drowning was sacrosanct. Hadrian commissioned the Barberini obelisk to commemorate his late lover&#x27;s funeral rites, including the Egyptian opening of the mouth ceremony; the obelisk was erected in Rome and the cult of Antinous was propagated throughout the provinces. Hadrian also sponsored building work at Philae, and both he and his successor Antoninus Pius sponsored work at Armant, Dendera, and Esna. The reign of Antoninus Pius – also patron of building works at Coptos, Medamud, Medinet Habu, and Tod – saw the last substantial building work on Egyptian temples. After those of Antoninus Pius found at Medinet Habu, Deir el-Shelwit, and Dendera, no further imperial cartouches are known from the regions of Thebes and the western oases. From the reign of Marcus Aurelius, who is recorded as having rededicated an offering to Hathor originally made by Ptolemy VIII &quot;Physcon&quot;, the rate of new temple building and decoration slackened. Commodus was recorded as Pharaonic sponsor of temples at Armant, Esna, Kom Ombo and Philae, the last emperor to be widely honoured in this way in surviving monuments; a general lack of resources and the political turbulence after Commodus&#x27;s assassination was probably responsible. The name of his successor Pertinax () is recorded at the Temple of Tutu at Kellis. After inscriptions of Commodus, Greek inscriptions are no longer found in the temples of the Faiyum. It is possible that the reform of Septimius Severus at the turn of the 3rd century aggravated the decline of the Egyptian temples; the &quot;mētropoleis&quot; now given administrative control over the temples of their &quot;nomoi&quot; did not prioritize their upkeep.
With a carved relief at Esna, Septimius Severus was commemorated, together with his son and co-&quot;augustus&quot; Caracalla, his wife Julia Domna the &quot;augusta&quot;, and their younger son Geta, on the occasion of the imperial tour of Egypt in 199–200. Caracalla&#x27;s own titles are recorded at Philae, Ombos, in Middle Egypt, and in the Delta. After he murdered his brother and co-&quot;augustus&quot; Geta, his image was removed from their father&#x27;s monument relief at Esna as part of the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; imposed by Caracalla. Caracalla&#x27;s successor was Macrinus, whose patronage is recorded only at Kom Ombo; evidence of his successor Elagabalus in Egypt has not survived, and neither is the patronage of Severus Alexander recorded.

Monumental temple-building and decoration among the Egyptian cults ceased altogether in the early 3rd century. After Philip the Arab&#x27;s cartouche was added to the temple wall at Esna, his successor Decius&#x27;s cartouche was carved into it, the last known instance of this long-established practice of usurping pharaohs&#x27; erasure of their predecessors&#x27; dynastic legacy. Philip the Arab&#x27;s reign saw the last Roman inscription found in the Temple of Kalabsha; at some time thereafter the site was abandoned by the Romans. At Tahta in Middle Egypt, the cartouche of Maximinus Daza was added to a since-ruined temple, along with other additions; he is the last Roman emperor known to have been recorded in official hieroglyphic script. The last Buchis bull of Hermonthis (Armant) was born in the reign of Licinius and died in the reign of Constantius II; the cartouche on its funerary &quot;stela&quot;, dedicated in 340, is the last of all. Under the Theodosian dynasty, during the joint reigns of Theodosius the Great and his sons Arcadius and Honorius, an inscription at Philae&#x27;s Temple of Harendotes commemorated the birthday of Osiris in the 110th &quot;anno Diocletiani&quot; (24 August 394), the latest hieroglyphic inscription to be dated securely.

Caligula allowed the worship of Egyptian gods in Rome, which had been formally forbidden since Augustus&#x27;s reign. In Rome, and at Beneventum (Benevento), Domitian established new temples to the Egyptian gods Isis and Serapis. A general &quot;Egyptomania&quot; followed Hadrian&#x27;s tour of the country, and Hadrian&#x27;s Villa at Tibur (Tivoli) included an Egyptian-themed area known as the Canopus. Hadrian may have been advised on religious matters by Pancrates, a poet and priest of Egypt.
===Christianity===
The authors of the New Testament do not record any missions of the apostles to Alexandria or any epistles to the Egyptians, though Egyptian and Alexandrian Jews in Jerusalem are mentioned in the &quot;Book of Acts&quot;. ( and .) An Alexandrian Jew, Apollos, is recorded in the &quot;Book of Acts&quot; as speaking in the synagogue at Ephesus, and because of an interpolation to current by the 5th-century – e.g. in the &quot;Codex Bezae&quot; – which suggested Apollos had been converted to Christianity in Egypt (), Christianity&#x27;s arrival has been dated to the 1st century, but there is no sure evidence of this, as Apollos may have been converted elsewhere. The pseudepigraphical &quot;Secret Gospel of Mark&quot;, of dubious authenticity, is the first text to claim Mark the Apostle visited Egypt. The 3rd-century Sextus Julius Africanus&#x27;s chronology was probably the source of the 4th-century bishop Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s narrative of Mark&#x27;s arrival in Egypt, which conflicts with that of the &quot;Secret Gospel of Mark&quot; and is the earliest history of Alexandrian Christianity, including the names of the ten bishops who supposedly succeeded Mark before the late 2nd-century episcopate of Julian of Alexandria. The drive to connect Alexandria with the lives of New Testament characters was part of a desire to establish continuity and apostolic succession with the churches supposed to have been founded by Saint Peter and the other apostles. Christianity probably arrived in Egypt among the Hellenized Alexandrian Jews, from Palestine&#x27;s communities of Jewish Christians.

The earliest evidence of Christianity in Egypt is a letter written in the first half of the 3rd century and mentioning the gymnasiarch and the &quot;boulē&quot; (thereby indicating the author and recipient were of the upper class) uses the Christian &quot;nomina sacra&quot; and the , drawn from the Pauline epistles. Another papyrus from the same period records the names of candidates for liturgy service &quot;supervision of the water-tower and fountains of the metropolis&quot; of Arsinoë (Faiyum); among the names is one &quot;Antonios Dioscoros son of Origen, Alexandrian&quot;, against whose name is noted in . With Alexandrian citizenship and a Roman &quot;nomen&quot;, Antonios () was likely of higher social status than the other candidates on the list, and is the first named Egyptian Christian for which evidence exists. In the &quot;Chora&quot; beyond Alexandria, there is no evidence at all for Christianity in the 2nd century, excepting some ambiguous letters, besides some papyrus fragments of scriptures among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri and among the papyri found at Antinoöpolis and Hipponon (Qarara) in the Heracleopolite &quot;nome&quot; around Heracleopolis Magna. Many of these are in the form of codices rather than scrolls, the codex being preferred by Christian scribes. Among the 2nd-century New Testament papyri are Rylands Library Papyrus P52 and Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 3523 – fragments of the &quot;Gospel of John&quot; –, and Oxyrhynchus Papyrus LXIV 4404 a fragment of the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot;. It is not known whether these indicate a Christian presence outside the capital in the 2nd century, whether these papyri, dated subjectively by palaeography, are as old as has been proposed, or whether they were in Egypt when newly made or arrived in later times as already old books.
Bishops often named their successors (e.g. Peter, his brother, by Athanasius in 373) or the succession was effected by imposing the hands of a deceased bishop on the one chosen to follow him. By 200 it is clear that Alexandria was one of the great Christian centres. The Christian apologists Clement of Alexandria and Origen both lived part or all of their lives in that city, where they wrote, taught, and debated. With the Edict of Milan in 313, Constantine I ended the persecution of Christians. Over the course of the 5th century, paganism was suppressed and lost its following, as the poet Palladas pointedly noted. It lingered underground for many decades: the final edict against paganism was issued in 435, but graffiti at Philae in Upper Egypt proves worship of Isis persisted at its temples into the 6th century. Many Egyptian Jews also became Christians, but many others refused to do so, leaving them as the only sizable religious minority in a Christian country.

No sooner had the Egyptian Church achieved freedom and supremacy than it became subject to a schism and prolonged conflict which at times descended into civil war. Alexandria became the centre of the first great split in the Christian world, between the Arians, named for the Alexandrian priest Arius, and their opponents, represented by Athanasius, who became Archbishop of Alexandria in 326 after the First Council of Nicaea rejected Arius&#x27;s views. The Arian controversy caused years of riots and rebellions throughout most of the 4th century. In the course of one of these, the great temple of Serapis, the stronghold of paganism, was destroyed. Athanasius was alternately expelled from Alexandria and reinstated as its Archbishop between five and seven times.

Patristic authorship was dominated by Egyptian contributions: Athanasius, Didymus the Blind and Cyril, and the power of the Alexandrian see embodied in Athanasius, Theophilus, his nephew, Cyril and shortly by Dioscuros.

Egypt had an ancient tradition of religious speculation, enabling a variety of controversial religious views to thrive there. Not only did Arianism flourish, but other doctrines, such as Gnosticism and Manichaeism, either native or imported, found many followers. Another religious development in Egypt was the monasticism of the Desert Fathers, who renounced the material world in order to live a life of poverty in devotion to the Church.

Egyptian Christians took up monasticism with such enthusiasm that the Emperor Valens had to restrict the number of men who could become monks. Egypt exported monasticism to the rest of the Christian world. Another development of this period was the development of Coptic, a form of the Ancient Egyptian language written with the Greek alphabet supplemented by several signs to represent sounds present in Egyptian which were not present in Greek. It was invented to ensure the correct pronunciation of magical words and names in pagan texts, the so-called Greek Magical Papyri. Coptic was soon adopted by early Christians to spread the word of the gospel to native Egyptians and it became the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity and remains so to this day.

Christianity eventually spread out west to the Berbers. The Coptic Church was established in Egypt. Since Christianity blended with local traditions, it never truly united the people against Arabian forces in the seventh and eight centuries. Later on in the seventh and eighth centuries, Christianity spread out to Nubia.

The fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century further isolated the Egyptian Romans from Rome&#x27;s culture and hastened the growth of Christianity. The success of Christianity led to a virtual abandonment of pharaonic traditions: with the disappearance of the Egyptian priests and priestesses who officiated at the temples, no-one could read the hieroglyphs of Pharaonic Egypt, and its temples were converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.

Cyril, the patriarch of Alexandria, convinced the city&#x27;s governor to expel the Jews from the city in 415 with the aid of the mob, in response to the Jews&#x27; alleged night-time massacre of many Christians. The murder of the philosopher Hypatia in March 415 marked a dramatic turn in classical Hellenic culture in Egypt but philosophy thrived in sixth century Alexandria. Another schism in the Church produced prolonged disturbances and may have alienated Egypt from the Empire. The countless papyrus finds mark the continuance of Greek culture and institutions at various levels.

The new religious controversy was over the Christ&#x27;s human and divine nature. The issue was whether he had two natures, human and divine, or a combined one (hypostatic union from his humanity and divinity). In an intensely religious age, it was enough to divide an empire. The Miaphysite controversy arose after the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and continued until well after the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which ruled in favour of the position that Christ was &quot;one person in two natures&quot; as opposed to Monophysitism (a single nature).

Monophysite belief was not held by the &#x27;miaphysites&#x27; as they stated that Jesus was out of two natures in one nature called, the &quot;Incarnate Logos of God&quot;. Many of the &#x27;miaphysites&#x27; claimed that they were misunderstood, that there was really no difference between their position be the Chalcedonian position, and that the Council of Chalcedon ruled against them because of political motivations alone. The Church of Alexandria split from the Churches of Rome and Constantinople over this issue, creating what would become the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which remains a major force in Egyptian religious life today. Egypt and Syria remained hotbeds of Miaphysite sentiment, and organised resistance to the Chalcedonian view was not suppressed until the 570s.

==History==
=== Early Roman Egypt (30 BC–4th century) ===

The province was established in 30 BC after Octavian (the future Roman emperor Augustus) defeated his rival Mark Antony, deposed Pharaoh Cleopatra, and annexed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to the Roman Empire.

The first prefect of Aegyptus, Gaius Cornelius Gallus, brought Upper Egypt under Roman control by force of arms, and established a protectorate over the southern frontier district, which had been abandoned by the later Ptolemies.

The second prefect, Aelius Gallus, made an unsuccessful expedition to conquer Arabia Petraea and even Arabia Felix. The Red Sea coast of Aegyptus was not brought under Roman control until the reign of Claudius. The third prefect, Gaius Petronius, cleared the neglected canals for irrigation, stimulating a revival of agriculture. Petronius even led a campaign into present-day central Sudan against the Kingdom of Kush at Meroe, whose queen Imanarenat had previously attacked Roman Egypt. Failing to acquire permanent gains, in 22 BC he razed the city of Napata to the ground and retreated to the north.

The reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius were mainly peaceful in Egypt, with intermittent civil strife between Greeks and Jews in Alexandria. According to the Latin historian Tacitus, Germanicus visited Egypt without the permission of Tiberius and caused a rift with his uncle, the emperor. Claudius refused Alexandrian demands for self-government under their own senate, and attempted to quell the unrest between Alexandrian Greek and Jews. Under Nero, perhaps influenced by Chaeremon of Alexandria – an Egyptian priest and the emperor&#x27;s Stoic tutor – an expedition to Meroë was undertaken, though possible plans for an invasion of the southern kingdom was forestalled by the military demands of the First Jewish–Roman War, a revolt in Judaea.

The first &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot; of Alexandrian origin was Tiberius Julius Alexander, who was governor through the Year of the Four Emperors and who eventually proclaimed the general Vespasian, victor in the Jewish War, emperor at Alexandria in July 69 AD. This prefect was himself of Hellenized Jewish descent and related to Philo of Alexandria. The importance of the Egyptian grain harvest () to Rome helped Vespasian assert control over the whole empire.

From the reign of Nero onward, Aegyptus enjoyed an era of prosperity which lasted a century. Much trouble was caused by religious conflicts between the Greeks and the Jews, particularly in Alexandria, which after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 became the world centre of Jewish religion and culture.

Vespasian was the first emperor since Augustus to appear in Egypt. At Alexandria he was hailed as pharaoh; recalling the welcome of Alexander the Great at the Oracle of Zeus-Ammon of the Siwa Oasis, Vespasian was proclaimed the son of the creator-deity Amun (Zeus-Ammon), in the style of the ancient pharaohs, and an incarnation of Serapis in the manner of the Ptolemies. As Pharaonic precedent demanded, Vespasian demonstrated his divine election by the traditional methods of spitting on and trampling a blind and crippled man, thereby miraculously healing him. (This Egyptian tradition of healing is related to the healing the man blind from birth, one of the miracles of Jesus of Nazareth.)

In 114, during the reign of Trajan (), unrest among the Jews of Alexandria broke out after the coming of a Messiah was announced at Cyrene. The uprising that year was defeated, but between 115 and 117 a revolt continued in the countryside in the absence of the armies away on Trajan&#x27;s Parthian campaign. This Diaspora Revolt meant that the Greeks and the Egyptian peasants took up arms in the fight against the Jews, which culminated in their defeat and the effective destruction of the Alexandrian Jewish community, which did not recover until the 3rd century. The city of Oxyrhynchus, by contrast, celebrated their survival of the rebellion with annual festivals for at least eighty years.

In the reign of Trajan&#x27;s successor Hadrian (), an Egyptian revolt was instigated on the occasion of a new Apis bull&#x27;s identification in 122; this rebellion was soon suppressed. Hadrian himself toured Egypt with his court for eight to ten months in 130–131, embarking on a Nile cruise, hunting lions in the desert, and making the dawn visit to the Colossi of Memnon. Hadrian founded the city of Antinoöpolis where his lover Antinous drowned in the river; the &quot;polis&quot; joined the other three &quot;poleis&quot; as a city with Hellenic citizenship rights, and he commissioned the &quot;Via Hadriana&quot;, connecting Antinoöpolis with Berenice Troglodytica, on the Red Sea.

In 139, at the start of the reign of Antoninus Pius (), the Sothic cycle came to its end, meaning that for the first time in 1,460 years, the heliacal rising of Sirius coincided with the Egyptian calendar&#x27;s New Year. The emperor&#x27;s coinage commemorated the good fortune this was expected to portend with images of the millennial phoenix. At some time during his reign, Antoninus Pius visited Alexandria and had new gates and a new hippodrome built, but in 153, a riot in Alexandria killed the 

The destructive Antonine Plague epidemic affected Egypt from 165 to 180; evidence of mass graves from that time has been discovered by archaeological excavation in the Valley of the Queens. A revolt of the native Egyptians from 171 was suppressed only in 175, after much fighting. This &quot;Bucolic War&quot;, named for the native &quot;herdsmen&quot; () was led by one Isidorus and had defeated the Roman garrison of Egypt. Control was re-established by Avidius Cassius, the governor of Roman Syria and son of an erstwhile &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot;, who then declared himself emperor in 175, being acknowledged by his own armies and the Army of Egypt amid rumours that the emperor Marcus Aurelius () was dead. On the emperor&#x27;s approach, Cassius was deposed and killed after three months&#x27; rule, and the clemency of Marcus Aurelius restored peace as he visited Alexandria in 176.

Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s successor Commodus () overturned his adoptive father&#x27;s pardon of Avidius Cassius&#x27;s family by having them all murdered at the beginning of his reign. After Commodus&#x27;s own murder, Pertinax was appointed emperor on 1 January 193, but this was only officially noticed in Egypt in early March, shortly before Pertinax&#x27;s murder; news of this did not become known in parts of Egypt until late May. Pescennius Niger (), who had commanded a garrison at Aswan and the army in Syria, was recognized as the reigning emperor of Egypt by June 193, with Egypt ignoring the claims made in the brief reign of Didius Julianus at Rome.

Following Hadrian&#x27;s route, Septimius Severus made a tour of Egypt in 199–200, visiting the Colossi of Memnon and ordering the statues repaired, which resulted in the natural &quot;singing&quot; phenomenon reported by visitors to the Colossi for centuries ceasing to be heard. A series of administrative reforms, probably intended to improve revenue collection, included a new &quot;boulē&quot; (a local council or senate) for Alexandria, and for the &quot;mētropolis&quot; of each &quot;nome&quot;, instituted in 200/201.

Caracalla () granted Roman citizenship to all Egyptians, in common with the other provincials, with the 212 &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot;. As a consequence, many Egyptians adopted the emperor&#x27;s &quot;nomen gentilicium&quot;, &quot;Aurelius&quot; (after his imperial predecessor Marcus Aurelius) as their name according to Roman naming conventions, though citizenship&#x27;s entitlements were less valuable than in past centuries and carried a tax burden. Caracalla murdered his brother and co-&quot;augustus&quot; Geta not long after their father&#x27;s death, claiming self-defence and imposing a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;; this excuse and other defects of the emperor&#x27;s character were mocked by the Alexandrians as he approached Egypt in 215, angering Caracalla. The emperor massacred Alexandria&#x27;s welcoming delegation and allowed his army to sack the city; afterwards, he barred Egyptians from entering the place (except where for religious or trade reasons) and increased its security.

Macrinus (), having assassinated Caracalla, assumed power and dispatched a new &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot; and, breaking precedent, a senator to govern Egypt. When the deaths of Macrinus and his co-&quot;augustus&quot; Diadumenian () after the Battle of Antioch were announced in Alexandria, the Alexandrians rose up, killed the senator, and forced out the prefect. The victor in the civil war was Elagabalus (), himself succeeded by Severus Alexander () after the former&#x27;s murder, but even though Severus Alexander may have visited Alexandria, neither emperor is much recorded in Egyptian sources.

After Decius died, Trebonianus Gallus () was recognized as emperor; in 253 an embassy from Meroë to the Romans is attested from a &quot;graffito&quot; carved at Philae. Both Trebonianus Gallus and Aemilianus () had coins issued in their names at Alexandria. During the reigns of Valerian () and his son Gallienus (), the empire&#x27;s instability was compounded by the Valerianic Persecution and the unprecedented total defeat and capture of Valerian by the Sasanian Empire&#x27;s Shapur I () at the 260 Battle of Edessa. After this humiliation, the army acclaimed the brothers Quietus and Macrianus () &quot;augusti&quot;; they were the acknowledged emperors in Egypt. When they were overthrown, the Alexandrians acclaimed Lucius Mussius Aemilianus, the &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot; as their new emperor. He enjoyed successes against the Blemmyes attacking the Thebaid, but by August 262 Alexandria was devastated and had lost two thirds of its inhabitants amid street fighting between the loyalists of Aemilianus and Gallienus; Aemilianus was defeated.

There was a series of revolts, both military and civilian, through the 3rd century. Under Decius, in 250, the Christians again suffered from persecution, but their religion continued to spread. The prefect of Aegyptus in 260, Mussius Aemilianus, first supported the Macriani, usurpers during the rule of Gallienus, and later, in 261, became a usurper himself, but was defeated by Gallienus.

During the existence of the break-away Palmyrene Empire, Egypt came under the rule of Zenobia. Under her control, the Palmyrene state went to war with Rome, holding Egypt against Aurelian (); his forces, led by his eventual successor Probus (), captured Egypt by the end of 271. In 272 however, both Alexandria and Palmyra were again in revolt, at the instigation of Firmus, an Alexandrian with connections to the Blemmyes. Aurelian besieged Alexandria and Firmus killed himself. The reign of Aurelian&#x27;s successor Marcus Claudius Tacitus () left no known surviving mark on Egypt, and his brother Florianus () was overthrown by Probus with the support of the Army of Egypt. The Blemmyes attacked Coptos and Ptolemais with incursions into Upper Egypt; Probus defeated them.

=== Later Roman Egypt (4th–7th centuries) ===

Coptos revolted in 293 and was destroyed by the &quot;augustus&quot; Diocletian&#x27;s &quot;caesar&quot; (junior co-emperor) and future successor, Galerius (). Diocletian&#x27;s reforms subdivided the empire into more numerous late Roman provinces; these were grouped into thirteen Roman dioceses, and these into four praetorian prefectures. The old province of Aegyptus was divided, with the Thebaid becoming its own province. Financial and tax reforms were implemented in Egypt in 297, and Egyptian currency was brought into line with the rest of the empire&#x27;s monetary reforms. The role of the &quot;praefectus Aegypti&quot; was divided between a &quot;praeses&quot; – a civilian governor – and a military &quot;dux&quot;.

In 297, Domitius Domitianus led a revolt and made himself emperor, assisted by Achilleus. Diocletian captured Alexandria from them after an eight-month siege and &quot;Pompey&#x27;s Pillar&quot; was erected in his honour in the Serapeum of Alexandria. Diocletian then travelled through Egypt as far as Philae, where new gates were constructed for the occasion. Diocletian is also known to have visited Panopolis in 298. He ceded the Dodekaschoinos, upstream of the First Cataract in Lower Nubia, to the Noba people, who were subsidized by the Romans to defend the frontier, now at Syene (Aswan), from attack by the Blemmyes. Diocletian&#x27;s second visit to Egypt, in 302, involved distributions of bread to the Alexandrians and actions taken against adherents of Manichaeism; the following year, Diocletian instituted the Diocletianic Persecution against Christianity. The persecution was remembered as particularly intense under Satrius Arrianus and Sossianus Hierocles, the &quot;praefecti&quot; between 304 and 307 and in 310 respectively. The Edict of Serdica published by Galerius, the senior emperor in 311, ended the Diocletianic Persecution.In 313, having defeated their rivals, the co-&quot;augusti&quot; Licinius () and Constantine the Great () issued their Edict of Milan, giving Christianity official recognition among the Romans&#x27; other religions. The tax system was reformed, and new fifteen-year cycles (back-dated to 312) of indictions were instituted for revenue purposes. The former soldier Pachomius the Great was baptized into Christianity in 313. Constantine may have planned a visit to Egypt in 325, since preparations were made for an imperial reception at Oxyrhynchus, but these plans would have been forestalled by the convocation of the Christian First Council of Nicaea. The Nicene Creed united most of the Christian Church against the Arianism promoted by the Egyptian bishop Arius and in favour of the doctrines of another Egyptian bishop, Athanasius of Alexandria. In 330, the Christian monastic Macarius of Egypt established his monastery at Scetis (Wadi El Natrun) in the Nitrian Desert.

On 24 February 391, the emperor Theodosius the Great (), in the names of himself and his co-&quot;augusti&quot; (his brother-in-law Valentinian II () and his own son Arcadius ()) banned sacrifices and worship at temples throughout the empire in a decree addressed to Rome&#x27;s &quot;praefectus urbi&quot;. On 16 June, writing to the &quot;praefectus augustalis&quot; and the &quot;comes Aegypti&quot;, Theodosius and his imperial colleagues reissued the ban on temple worship and sacrifices for Alexandria and Egypt specifically.

Unrest was fomented against the pagan inhabitants by the bishop, Theophilus of Alexandria, who provoked riots by attempting to convert a temple into a church and staging the discovery of Christian relics. These were processed through the streets and the pagans were forced to take refuge in the Serapeum, with the philosopher Olympius at their head. The Christian mob loyal to Theophilus sacked the Serapeum, and ultimately it was rededicated as a church to John the Baptist. The Serapeum of Canopus (Abu Qir) was looted at the same time, becoming first a monastery and then a church dedicated to Cyrus and John. Ammonius Grammaticus – a priest of Thoth – and the Alexandrian poet Claudian both subsequently fled Egypt, for Constantinople and Rome respectively.

Arcadius&#x27; son and successor Theodosius II&#x27;s long reign () saw the unrest generated by the bishop Cyril of Alexandria; he was opposed to the doctrines of Nestorius, bishop of Constantinople, in relation to the title Mother of God (&quot;Theotokos&quot;). The faction of Cyril, aided by Shenoute, prevailed, and Nestorius, having been denounced at the 431 Council of Ephesus, was banished in 435 to the Kharga Oasis in the Western Desert. The see of Alexandria&#x27;s bishop reached the zenith of its influence in 449, when under Dioscorus I () it successfully defended the doctrines of Eutyches at the Second Council of Ephesus against the positions of Dioscorus&#x27; rival bishops, Leo I of Rome and Flavian of Constantinople.

The Blemmyes continued to attack Roman Egypt, though they were romanticized by pagans for their resistance to the Christians. Olympiodorus of Thebes wrote a positive account of them after a visit in . In 451, the emperor Marcian () arrived at a peace treaty with the Blemmyes which allowed them the use of the temple at Philae annually and permitted them to use (and return) the temples&#x27; cult statues for oracular purposes.

Marcian however, convened the 451 Council of Chalcedon, overturning the conclusions of the Second Council of Ephesus, condemning Dioscorus and sending him into exile. The resultant, and lasting, schism between the Coptic Church and the state church of the Roman Empire dates from this time. Proterius was appointed bishop in Dioscorus&#x27; stead. When the Alexandrians heard of the accession of Marcian&#x27;s successor Leo I, they tore apart the hated Proterius and replaced him with their own nomination, Timothy II, whose election was not recognized by either Leo or his successor and son-in-law Zeno. When Leo&#x27;s brother-in-law Basiliscus seized Zeno&#x27;s throne in 475, his monophysitism enabled a thaw in relations between Alexandria and the eastern imperial capital, but Zeno&#x27;s recovery of Constantinople the following year resumed the hostility. Zeno&#x27;s attempt to repair relations between Rome, Constantinople and Alexandria resulted in his own excommunication by the bishop of Rome, Felix III, and beginning the Acacian schism.
The Sasanian Empire invaded the Nile Delta in the reign of Anastasius I (), though the Sasanian army retreated after they failed to capture Alexandria or make significant gains. In the early 6th century and in the reign of Justin I (), the Blemmyes again made attacks on Upper Egypt. Justin&#x27;s successor Justinian I () and his wife, the &quot;augusta&quot; Theodora, both sought to convert the Noba to Christianity; envoys of Justinian promoted dyophysitism but the Noba were persuaded to adopt the monophysitism of the Coptic Church by emissaries of the empress. Newly converted, they assisted the Roman army in its conquest of the pagan Blemmyes, and the general Narses was in 543 sent to confiscate the cult statues of Philae (which were sent to Constantinople), close the temple, and suppress its priesthood by imprisonment. In 577, during the retirement of Justinian&#x27;s successor Justin II () and the start of Tiberius II Constantine&#x27;s reign (), the defences at Philae had to be rebuilt to repel attacks by the Blemmyes.The reign of Constantine the Great also saw the founding of Constantinople as a new capital for the Roman Empire, and in the course of the 4th century, the Empire was divided in two, with Egypt finding itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Latin, never well established in Egypt, would play a declining role with Greek continuing to be the dominant language of government and scholarship. During the 5th and 6th centuries the Eastern Roman Empire, known historiographically as the Byzantine Empire, gradually transformed itself into a thoroughly Christian state whose culture differed significantly from its pagan past.

The Eastern Empire became increasingly &quot;oriental&quot; in style as its links with the old Græco-Roman world faded. The Greek system of local government by citizens had now entirely disappeared. Offices, with new Greek-Byzantine names, were almost hereditary in the wealthy land-owning families. Alexandria, the second city of the empire, continued to be a centre of religious controversy and violence.

Egypt nevertheless continued to be an important economic center for the Empire supplying much of its agriculture and manufacturing needs as well as continuing to be an important center of scholarship. It would supply the needs of the Byzantine Empire and the Mediterranean as a whole. The reign of Justinian (527–565) saw the Empire recapture Rome and much of Italy from the barbarians, but these successes left the empire&#x27;s eastern flank exposed. The Empire&#x27;s &quot;bread basket&quot; now lacked protection.

==== Episcopal sees ====
Ancient episcopal sees of the Roman province of Aegyptus Primus (I) listed in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; as titular sees, suffragans of the Patriarchate of Alexandria are enumerated in the following. The list here, however, does not cover other provinces such as Augustamnica, Arcadia and Thebais.
Ancient episcopal sees of the Roman province of Aegyptus Secundus (II) listed in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; as titular sees :
=== Sassanian Persian invasion (619 AD) ===
The Sasanian conquest of Egypt, beginning in AD 618 or 619, was one of the last Sassanid triumphs in the Roman-Persian Wars against Roman Empire. From 619 to 628, they incorporated Egypt once again within their territories, the previous longer time being under the Achaemenids. Khosrow II Parvêz had begun this war on the pretext of retaliation for the assassination of Emperor Maurice (582–602) and had achieved a series of early successes, culminating in the conquests of Jerusalem (614) and Alexandria (619).

A Byzantine counteroffensive launched by Emperor Heraclius in the spring of 622 shifted the advantage, and the war was brought to an end by the fall of Khosrow on 25 February 628. The Egyptians had no love of the emperor in Constantinople and put up little resistance. Khosrow&#x27;s son and successor, Kavadh II Šêrôe (Šêrôy), who reigned until September, concluded a peace treaty returning territories conquered by the Sassanids to the Eastern Roman Empire.

The Sassanian conquest allowed Miaphysitism to resurface in the open in Egypt, and when imperial rule was restored by Emperor Heraclius in 629, the Miaphysites were persecuted and their patriarch expelled. Egypt was thus in a state of both religious and political alienation from the Empire when a new invader appeared.

=== Arab Islamic conquest (639–646 AD) ===

An army of 4,000 Arabs led by Amr Ibn Al-Aas was sent by the Caliph Umar, successor to Muhammad, to spread Islamic rule to the west. Arabs crossed into Egypt from Palestine in December 639, and advanced rapidly into the Nile Delta. The Imperial garrisons retreated into the walled towns, where they successfully held out for a year or more.

The Arabs sent for reinforcements, and in April 641 they besieged and captured Alexandria. The Byzantines assembled a fleet with the aim of recapturing Egypt, and won back Alexandria in 645. The Muslims retook the city in 646, completing the Muslim conquest of Egypt. 40,000 civilians were evacuated to Constantinople with the imperial fleet, thus ending 975 years of Greco-Roman rule over Egypt.

<doc id="496524" wikidata="Q1137542" url="?curid=496524" title="Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park">
<text>is a national park in Yamanashi, Shizuoka, and Kanagawa Prefectures, and western Tokyo Metropolis, Japan. It consists of Mount Fuji, Fuji Five Lakes, Hakone, the Izu Peninsula, and the Izu Islands. Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park covers .

Rather than being a specific spot, the park is a collection of dispersed tourist sites that dot the region. The farthest point south, the isle of Hachijō-jima, is several hundred kilometers from Mount Fuji. The park includes a variety of geographic features including natural hot springs, coastlines on the Pacific, mountainous areas, lakes, and more than 1,000 volcanic islands. Vegetation in the park ranges from species of mountainous trees to the subtropical vegetation of the Izu Islands.

Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park was established on February 2, 1936, as Fuji-Hakone National Park, and is one of the first four national parks established in Japan. In 1950, the Izu islands were added to the park, a change that also reflected in the park&#x27;s revised name. Due to its proximity to the Tokyo metropolis and ease of transportation, it is the most visited national park in all of Japan.

Nearby cities include Odawara, Fuji, Minami Ashigara, and Numazu.

<doc id="496527" wikidata="Q2363432" url="?curid=496527" title="Belligerent">
<text>A belligerent is an individual, group, country, or other entity that acts in a hostile manner, such as engaging in combat. The term comes from the Latin &quot;bellum gerere&quot; (&quot;to wage war&quot;). Unlike the use of &quot;belligerent&quot; as an adjective meaning &quot;aggressive&quot;, its use as a noun does not necessarily imply that a belligerent country is an aggressor.

In times of war, belligerent countries can be contrasted with neutral countries and non-belligerents. However, the application of the laws of war to neutral countries and the responsibilities of belligerents are not affected by any distinction between &quot;neutral countries&quot;, &quot;neutral powers&quot; or &quot;non-belligerents.&quot;
==Belligerency==

&quot;Belligerency&quot; is a term used in international law to indicate the status of two or more entities, generally sovereign states, being engaged in a war. Wars are often fought with one or both parties to a conflict invoking the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter (as the United Kingdom did in 1982 before the start of the Falklands War) or under the auspices of a United Nations Security Council resolution (such as the United Nations Security Council Resolution 678, which gave legal authority for the Gulf War).

A state of belligerency may also exist between one or more sovereign states on one side and rebel forces, if such rebel forces are recognised as belligerents. If there is a rebellion against a constituted authority (for example, an authority recognised as such by the United Nations), and those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents, the rebellion is an insurgency. Once the status of belligerency is established between two or more states, their relations are determined and governed by the laws of war.

<text>A classic stamp is a postage stamp of a type considered distinctive by philatelists, typically applied to stamps printed in the early period of stamp production, e.g., before about 1870. However, as L. N. Williams puts it, &quot;the term has never been satisfactorily defined&quot;. Definitions have included stamps issued before 1900, although not all stamps issued before 1900 are considered &quot;classic&quot;, while some stamps issued in the first few years after 1900 are considered &quot;classic.&quot; Williams suggests that the classic period extends from 1840 to 1875, and James A. Mackay, in his &quot;World of Classic Stamps,&quot; New York (1972) applied the term to stamps produced from 1840 to 1870. Other collectors consider the classics cover regular issues to 1869, but include the re-issues of 1875. The U.S. Philatelic Classics Society (USPCS) is a society dedicated to the study of United States postal issues and postal history from the Stampless era up to 1893.

To some extent it conveys collectors&#x27; prejudices for or against particular countries or specialties. For instance, the Canadian stamps of the 1930s are highly regarded for their design and production quality, and are routinely called &quot;classics&quot;; but the term is much less likely to be used of the US stamps of the same period, and very few would characterize the poorly printed Mexican stamps of the 1930s as &quot;classic&quot;, even though Mexico&#x27;s first stamps, the Hidalgo issue, are equally poor but always considered classics.

<text>Propofol is the active component of an intravenous anesthetic formulation used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It is chemically termed 2,6-diisopropylphenol. The formulation was approved under the brand name Diprivan. Numerous generic versions have since been released. Intravenous administration is used to induce unconsciousness after which anesthesia may be maintained using a combination of medications. It is manufactured as part of a sterile injectable emulsion formulation using soybean oil and lecithin, giving it a white milky coloration.

Recovery from propofol-induced anesthesia is generally rapid and associated with less frequent side effects (e.g., drowsiness, nausea, vomiting) compared to other anesthetic agents. Propofol may be used prior to diagnostic procedures requiring anesthesia, in the management of refractory status epilepticus, and for induction or maintenance of anesthesia prior to and during surgeries. It may be administered as a bolus or an infusion, or some combination of the two.

First synthesized in 1973, by John B. Glen, a British veterinary anesthesiologist working for Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI, later AstraZeneca), in 1986 propofol was introduced for therapeutic use as a lipid emulsion in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Propofol (Diprivan) received FDA approval in October 1989. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Uses==

===Anesthesia===
To induce general anesthesia, propofol is the drug used almost exclusively, having largely replaced sodium thiopental.

It is often administered as part of an anesthesia maintenance technique called total intravenous anesthesia, using either manually programmed infusion pumps or computer-controlled infusion pumps in a process called target controlled infusion (TCI).

Propofol is also used to sedate people who are receiving mechanical ventilation but not undergoing surgery, such as patients in the intensive care unit. In critically ill patients, propofol is superior to lorazepam both in effectiveness and overall cost. Propofol is relatively inexpensive compared to medications of similar use due to shorter ICU stay length. One of the reasons propofol is thought to be more effective (although it has a longer half-life than lorazepam) is that studies have found that benzodiazepines like midazolam and lorazepam tend to accumulate in critically ill patients, prolonging sedation.

Propofol has also been suggested as a sleep aid in critically ill adults in an ICU setting; however, the effectiveness of this medicine in replicating the mental and physical aspects of sleep for people in the ICU is not clear.

Propofol can be administered via a peripheral IV or central line. Propofol is often paired with fentanyl (for pain relief) in intubated and sedated people. The two drugs are molecularly compatible in an IV mixture form.

Propofol is also used to deepen anesthesia to relieve laryngospasm. It may be used alone or followed by succinylcholine. Its use can avoid the need for paralysis and in some instances the potential side-effects of succinylcholine.

===Routine procedural sedation===
Propofol is safe and effective for gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures (colonoscopies etc.). Its use in these settings results in a faster recovery compared to midazolam. It can also be combined with opioids or benzodiazepines. Because of its rapid induction and recovery time, propofol is also widely used for sedation of infants and children undergoing MRI procedures. It is also often used in combination with ketamine with minimal side effects.

===COVID-19===

In March 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for &quot;Propofol‐Lipuro&quot; 1% to maintain sedation via continuous infusion in people older than sixteen with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit ICU setting. During the public health emergency, it was considered unfeasible to limit Fresenius Propoven 2% Emulsion or Propofol-Lipuro 1% to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, so it was made available to all ICU patients under mechanical ventilation. This EUA has since been revoked.

===Status epilepticus===
Status epilepticus may be defined as seizure activity lasting beyond five minutes and needing anticonvulsant medication. Several guidelines recommend the use of propofol for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus.
===Other uses===
====Assisted death in Canada====
A lethal dose of propofol is used for medical assistance in dying in Canada to quickly induce deep coma and death, but rocuronium is always given as a paralytic ensuring death, even when the patient has died as a result of initial propofol overdose.

====Capital punishment====
The use of propofol as part of an execution protocol has been considered, although no individual has been executed using this agent. This is largely due to European manufacturers and governments banning the export of this propofol for such use.

====Recreational use====
Recreational use of the drug via self-administration has been reported but is relatively rare due to its potency and the level of monitoring required for safe use. Critically, a steep dose-response curve makes recreational use of propofol very dangerous, and deaths from self-administration continue to be reported. The short-term effects sought via recreational use include mild euphoria, hallucinations, and disinhibition.

Recreational use of the drug has been described among medical staff, such as anesthetists who have access to the drug. It is reportedly more common among anesthetists on rotations with short rest periods, as usage generally produces a well-rested feeling. Long-term use has been reported to result in addiction.

Attention to the risks of off-label use of propofol increased in August 2009 due to the Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s conclusion that musician Michael Jackson died from a mixture of propofol and the benzodiazepine drugs lorazepam, midazolam, and diazepam on 25 June 2009. According to a 22 July 2009 search warrant affidavit unsealed by the district court of Harris County, Texas, Jackson&#x27;s physician, Conrad Murray, administered 25 milligrams of propofol diluted with lidocaine shortly before Jackson&#x27;s death.

==Manufacturing==
Propofol as a commercial sterile emulsified formulation is considered difficult to manufacture.

It was initially formulated in Cremophor for human use, but this original formulation was implicated in an unacceptable number of anaphylactic events. It was eventually manufactured as a 1% emulsion in soybean oil. Sterile emulsions represent complex formulation, the stability of which is dependent on the interplay of many factors such as micelle size and distribution. 

==Side effects==
One of propofol&#x27;s most common side effects is pain on injection, especially in smaller veins. This pain arises from activation of the pain receptor, TRPA1, found on sensory nerves and can be mitigated by pretreatment with lidocaine. Less pain is experienced when infused at a slower rate in a large vein (antecubital fossa). Patients show considerable variability in their response to propofol, at times showing profound sedation with small doses.

Additional side effects include low blood pressure related to vasodilation, transient apnea following induction doses, and cerebrovascular effects. Propofol has more pronounced hemodynamic effects relative to many intravenous anesthetic agents. Reports of blood pressure drops of 30% or more are thought to be at least partially due to inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity. This effect is related to the dose and rate of propofol administration. It may also be potentiated by opioid analgesics.

Propofol can also cause decreased systemic vascular resistance, myocardial blood flow, and oxygen consumption, possibly through direct vasodilation. There are also reports that it may cause green discoloration of the urine.

Although propofol is widely used in the adult ICU setting, the side effects associated with medication seem to be more concerning in children. In the 1990s, multiple reported deaths of children in ICUs associated with propofol sedation prompted the FDA to issue a warning.

As a respiratory depressant, propofol frequently produces apnea. The persistence of apnea can depend on factors such as premedication, dose administered, and rate of administration, and may sometimes persist for longer than 60 seconds. Possibly as the result of depression of the central inspiratory drive, propofol may produce significant decreases in respiratory rate, minute volume, tidal volume, mean inspiratory flow rate, and functional residual capacity.

Propofol administration also results in decreased cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption, and intracranial pressure. In addition, propofol may decrease intraocular pressure by as much as 50% in patients with normal intraocular pressure.

A more serious but rare side effect is dystonia. Mild myoclonic movements are common, as with other intravenous hypnotic agents. Propofol appears to be safe for use in porphyria, and has not been known to trigger malignant hyperpyrexia.

Propofol is also reported to induce priapism in some individuals, and has been observed to suppress REM sleep and to worsen the poor sleep quality in some patients.

Rare side effects include:
* anxiety
* changes in vision
* cloudy urine
* coughing up blood
* delirium or hallucinations
* difficult urination
* difficulty swallowing
* dry eyes, mouth, nose, or throat
As with any other general anesthetic agent, propofol should be administered only where appropriately trained staff and facilities for monitoring are available, as well as proper airway management, a supply of supplemental oxygen, artificial ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation.

Because of propofol&#x27;s formulation (using lecithin and soybean oil), it is prone to bacterial contamination, despite the presence of the bacterial inhibitor benzyl alcohol; consequently, some hospital facilities require the IV tubing (of continuous propofol infusions) to be changed after 12 hours. This is a preventive measure against microbial growth and potential infection.

===Propofol infusion syndrome===

A rare, but serious, side effect is propofol infusion syndrome. This potentially lethal metabolic derangement has been reported in critically ill patients after a prolonged infusion of high-dose propofol, sometimes in combination with catecholamines and/or corticosteroids.

== Interactions ==

The respiratory effects of propofol are increased if given with other respiratory depressants, including benzodiazepines.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Propofol has been proposed to have several mechanisms of action, both through potentiation of GABAA receptor activity and therefore acting as a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, thereby slowing the channel-closing time. At high doses, propofol may be able to activate GABAA receptors in the absence of GABA, behaving as a GABAA receptor agonist as well. Propofol analogs have been shown to also act as sodium channel blockers. Some research has also suggested that the endocannabinoid system may contribute significantly to propofol&#x27;s anesthetic action and to its unique properties, as endocannabinoids also play an important role in the physiologic control of sleep, pain processing and emesis. An EEG study on patients undergoing general anesthesia with propofol found that it causes a prominent reduction in the brain&#x27;s information integration capacity.

Propofol is an inhibitor of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase, which metabolizes the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA). Activation of the endocannabinoid system by propofol, possibly via inhibition of AEA catabolism, generates a significant increase in the whole-brain content of AEA, contributing to the sedative properties of propofol via CB1 receptor activation. This may explain the psychotomimetic and antiemetic properties of propofol. By contrast, there is a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting after administration of volatile anesthetics, which contribute to a significant decrease in the whole-brain content of AEA that can last up to forty minutes after induction.

===Pharmacokinetics===

Propofol is highly protein-bound &quot;in vivo&quot; and is metabolized by conjugation in the liver. The half-life of elimination of propofol has been estimated to be between 2 and 24 hours. However, its duration of clinical effect is much shorter, because propofol is rapidly distributed into peripheral tissues. When used for IV sedation, a single dose of propofol typically wears off within minutes. Onset is rapid, in as little as 15–30 seconds. Propofol is versatile; the drug can be given for short or prolonged sedation, as well as for general anesthesia. Its use is not associated with nausea as is often seen with opioid medications. These characteristics of rapid onset and recovery along with its amnestic effects have led to its widespread use for sedation and anesthesia.

==History==
John B. Glen, a veterinarian and researcher at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), spent thirteen years developing propofol, an effort for which he was awarded the 2018 Lasker Award for clinical research.

Originally developed as ICI 35868, propofol was chosen after extensive evaluation and structure–activity relationship studies of the anesthetic potencies and pharmacokinetic profiles of a series of &quot;ortho&quot;-alkylated phenols.

First identified as a drug candidate in 1973, propofol entered clinical trials in 1977, using a form solubilized in cremophor EL. However, due to anaphylactic reactions to cremophor, this formulation was withdrawn from the market and subsequently reformulated as an emulsion of a soya oil and propofol mixture in water. The emulsified formulation was relaunched in 1986 by ICI (whose pharmaceutical division later became a constituent of AstraZeneca) under the brand name Diprivan. The preparation contains 1% propofol, 10% soybean oil, and 1.2% purified egg phospholipid as an emulsifier, with 2.25% glycerol as a tonicity-adjusting agent, and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH. Diprivan contains EDTA, a common chelation agent, that also acts alone (bacteriostatically against some bacteria) and synergistically with some other antimicrobial agents. Newer generic formulations contain sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant and benzyl alcohol as an antimicrobial agent. Propofol emulsion is an opaque white fluid due to the scattering of light from the emulsified micelle formulation.

== Developments ==
A water-soluble prodrug form, fospropofol, has been developed and tested with positive results. Fospropofol is rapidly broken down by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase to form propofol. Marketed as &quot;Lusedra&quot;, this formulation may not produce the pain at the injection site that often occurs with the conventional form of the drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the product in 2008.

By incorporation of an azobenzene unit, a photoswitchable version of propofol (AP2) was developed in 2012 that allows for optical control of GABAA receptors with light. In 2013, a propofol binding site on mammalian GABAA receptors has been identified by photolabeling using a diazirine derivative. Additionally, it was shown that the hyaluronan polymer present in the synovia can be protected from free-radical depolymerization by propofol.

Ciprofol is another derivative of propofol that is 4–6 times more potent than propofol. it is undergoing Phase III trials. Ciprofol appears to have a lower incidence of injection site pain and respiratory depression than propofol.

Propofol has also been studied for treatment resistant depression.

== Veterinary uses ==
In November 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration approved PropofolVet Multidose, the first generic propofol injectable emulsion for dogs. PropofolVet Multidose is approved for use as an injectable anesthetic in dogs.

PropofolVet Multidose contains the same active ingredient (propofol injectable emulsion) as the approved brand name drug product, PropoFlo 28, which was first approved on 4 February 2011. In addition, the FDA determined that PropofolVet Multidose contains no inactive ingredients that may significantly affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient. PropofolVet Multidose is sponsored by Parnell Technologies Pty. Ltd. based in New South Wales, Australia.

<text>In philately, a line pair is a coil pair of postage stamps bearing an inked line between the two stamps. There are at least two kinds of these:
*A guide line pair has a guide line between the stamps. Since the guide lines are deliberately incised into the plate, they will generally be sharp and clear.
*A joint line pair has a joint line between the stamps, deriving from the seam in the cylindrical plate used to print the stamps. These lines are somewhat smeared in appearance.</text><links>

<doc id="496545" wikidata="Q1422495" url="?curid=496545" title="Lockheed P-2 Neptune">
<text>The Lockheed P-2 Neptune (designated P2V by the United States Navy prior to September 1962) is a maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft. It was developed for the US Navy by Lockheed to replace the Lockheed PV-1 Ventura and PV-2 Harpoon, and was replaced in turn by the Lockheed P-3 Orion. Designed as a land-based aircraft, the Neptune never made a carrier landing, but a small number were converted and deployed as carrier-launched (using JATO assist), stop-gap nuclear bombers that would have to land on shore or ditch. The type was successful in export, and saw service with several armed forces.

==Design and development==

Development of a new land-based patrol bomber began early in World War II, with design work starting at Lockheed&#x27;s Vega subsidiary as a private venture on 6 December 1941. At first, the new design was considered a low priority compared to other aircraft in development at the time, with Vega also developing and producing the PV-2 Harpoon patrol bomber. On 19 February 1943, the U.S. Navy signed a letter of intent for two prototype XP2Vs, which was confirmed by a formal contract on 4 April 1944 with a further 15 aircraft being ordered 10 days later. It was not until 1944 that the program went into full swing. A major factor in the design was ease of manufacture and maintenance, and this may have been a major factor in the type&#x27;s long life and worldwide success. The first aircraft flew in May 1945. Production began in 1946, and the aircraft was accepted into service in 1947. Potential use as a bomber led to successful launches from aircraft carriers.

Beginning with the P2V-5F model, the Neptune became one of the first operational aircraft fitted with both piston and jet engines. The Convair B-36, several Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter, Fairchild C-123 Provider, North American AJ Savage, and Avro Shackleton aircraft were also so equipped. To save weight and complexity of two separate fuel systems, the Westinghouse J34 jet engines on P2Vs burned the 115–145 Avgas fuel of the piston engines, instead of jet fuel. The jet pods were fitted with intake doors that remained closed when the J-34s were not running. This prevented windmilling, allowing for economical piston-engine-only long-endurance search and patrol operations. In normal US Navy operations, the jet engines were run at full power (97%) to assure takeoff, then shut down upon reaching a safe altitude. The jets were also started and kept running at flight idle during low-altitude ( during the day and at night) anti-submarine and/or anti-shipping operations as a safety measure should one of the radials develop problems.

Normal crew access was via a ladder on the aft bulkhead of the nosewheel well to a hatch on the left side of the wheel well, then forward to the observer nose, or up through another hatch to the main deck. There was also a hatch in the floor of the aft fuselage, near the sonobuoy chutes.

==Operational history==

===Early Cold War===
Before the P-3 Orion arrived in the mid-1960s, the Neptune was the primary U.S. land-based anti-submarine patrol aircraft, intended to be operated as the hunter of a &#x27;&quot;Hunter-Killer&quot; group, with destroyers employed as killers. Several features aided the P-2 in its hunter role:
* Sonobuoys could be launched from a station in the aft portion of the fuselage and monitored by radio
* Some models were equipped with &quot;pointable&quot; twin machine guns in the nose, but most had a forward observation bubble with an observer seat, a feature often seen in images.
* The AN/ASQ-8 Magnetic Anomaly Detector was fitted in an extended tail, producing a paper chart. Unmarked charts were not classified, but those with annotations were classified as secret.
* A belly-mounted AN/APS-20 surface-search radar enabled detection of surfaced and snorkeling submarines at considerable distances.

As the P-2 was replaced in the US Navy by the P-3A Orion in active Fleet squadrons in the early and mid-1960s, the P-2 continued to remain operational in the Naval Air Reserve through the mid-1970s, primarily in its SP-2H version. As active Fleet squadrons transitioned to the P-3B and P-3C in the mid- and late-1960s and early 1970s, the Naval Air Reserve P-2s were eventually replaced by P-3As and P-3Bs and the P-2 exited active U.S. naval service. VP-23 was the last active duty patrol squadron to operate the SP-2H, retiring its last Neptune on 20 February 1970, while the last Naval Reserve patrol squadron to operate the Neptune, VP-94, retired its last SP-2H in 1978.

===Nuclear bomber===
At the end of World War II, the US Navy felt the need to acquire a nuclear strike capability to maintain its political influence. In the short term, carrier-based aircraft were the best solution. The large Fat Man nuclear munitions at that time were bulky and required a very large aircraft to carry them. The US Navy Bureau of Ordnance built 25 outdated but more compact Little Boy nuclear bomb designs to be used in the smaller bomb bay of the P2V Neptune. There was enough fissionable material available by 1948 to build ten complete uranium projectiles and targets, although there were only enough initiators to complete six. The U.S. Navy improvised a carrier-based nuclear strike aircraft by modifying the P2V Neptune for carrier takeoff using jet assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters, with initial takeoff tests in 1948. However, the Neptune could not land on a carrier, therefore the crew had to either make their way to a friendly land base after a strike, or ditch in the sea near a U.S. Navy vessel. It was replaced in this emergency role by the North American AJ Savage (transferred to the Pacific Fleet in October 1952) the first nuclear strike aircraft that was fully capable of carrier launch and recovery operations; it was also short-lived in that role as the US Navy was adopting fully jet powered nuclear strike aircraft.

===Covert operations P2V-7U/RB-69A variants===
In 1954, under Project Cherry, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) obtained five, newly built P2V-7 and converted them into P2V-7U/RB-69A variants by Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works at Hangar B5 in Burbank, California for the CIA&#x27;s own private fleet of covert ELINT/ferret aircraft. Later, to make up for P2V-7U/RB-69A operational losses, the CIA obtained and converted two existing US Navy P2V-7s, one in September 1962 and one in December 1964, to P2V-7U/RB-69A Phase VI standard, and they also acquired an older P2V-5 from the US Navy as a training aircraft in 1963. Test flights were made by lead aircraft at Edwards AFB from 1955 to 1956 with all the aircraft painted with a dark sea blue color but with USAF markings. In 1957, one P2V-7U was sent to Eglin AFB for testing aircraft performance at low level and under adverse conditions.
The initial two aircraft were sent to Europe, based at Wiesbaden, West Germany, but were later withdrawn in 1959 when the CIA reduced its covert aircraft assets in Europe. The CIA sent the other two P2V-7U/RB-69As to Hsinchu Air Base, Taiwan, where by December 1957, they were given to a &quot;black op&quot; unit, the 34th Squadron, better known as the Black Bat Squadron, of the Republic of China Air Force; these were painted in ROCAF markings. The ROCAF P2V-7U/RB-69A&#x27;s mission was to conduct low-level penetration flights into mainland China to conduct ELINT/ferret missions including mapping out China&#x27;s air defense networks, inserting agents via airdrop, and dropping leaflets and supplies. The agreement for plausible deniability between US and Republic of China (ROC) governments meant the RB-69A would be manned by ROCAF crew while conducting operational missions, but would be manned by CIA crew when ferrying RB-69A out of Taiwan or other operational area to US.

The P2V-7U/RB-69A flew with ROCAF Black Bat Squadron over China from 1957 to November 1966. All five original aircraft (two crashed in South Korea, three shot down over China) were lost with all hands on board. In January 1967, two remaining RB-69As flew back to NAS Alameda, California, and were converted back to regular US Navy P2V-7/SP-2H ASW aircraft configurations. Most of the 34th Squadron&#x27;s black op missions remain classified by the CIA—though a CIA internal draft history, &quot;Low-Level Technical Reconnaissance over Mainland China (1955–66)&quot;, reference CSHP-2.348, written in 1972 that covers CIA/ROCAF 34th Squadron&#x27;s black op missions is known to exist. The CIA does not plan to declassify it until after 2022.

===Vietnam War===

During the Vietnam War, the Neptune was used by the US Navy as a gunship, as an overland reconnaissance and sensor deployment aircraft, and in its traditional role as a maritime patrol aircraft. The Neptune was also utilized by the US Army&#x27;s 1st Radio Research Company (Aviation), call sign &quot;Crazy Cat&quot;, based at Cam Ranh Air Base in South Vietnam, as an electronic &quot;ferret&quot; aircraft intercepting low-powered tactical voice and morse code radio signals. The US Army operated the P-2 from 1967 until 1972, flying 42,500 hours with no accidents. Observation Squadron 67 (VO-67), call sign &quot;Lindy&quot;, was the only P-2 Neptune aircraft squadron to ever receive the Presidential Unit Citation, flying Igloo White missions sowing seismic and acoustic sensors over the Ho Chi Minh trail. VO-67 lost three OP-2E aircraft and 20 aircrew to ground fire during its secret missions into Laos and Vietnam in 1967–68. The Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) secret 34th &quot;Black Bat&quot; Squadron&#x27;s RB-69A/P2V-7U ELINT/SIGINT aircraft flew a low level electronic reconnaissance from Da Nang Air Base, flying over Thanh Hóa Province on 20 August 1963 to investigate an air resupply drop zone that turned out to be a trap for a ROCAF C-123B airdrop mission 10 days earlier due to the air-inserted agents having been captured and turned. Next year, an air defense radar mapping mission was also flown by 34th Squadron&#x27;s RB-69A/P2V-7U aircraft into North Vietnam and Laos on the night of 16 March 1964. The RB-69A took off from Da Nang, flew up the Gulf of Tonkin before coasting in near Haiphong, then flew down North Vietnam and the Laos border. The mission was requested by SOG for helping plan the insert or resupply of agents. Seven AAA sites, 14 early warning radar sites and two GCI radar signals were detected.

Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Neptunes were also involved in the Vietnam War. These aircraft helped escort the fast transport from Australia to South Vietnam on several occasions in 1965 and 1966. Australian Neptunes also occasionally operated as airborne early warning aircraft over Thailand using their AN/APS-120 radar; this was done only when the aircraft were transiting through Thai airspace on other taskings. During these sorties the Neptunes warned American aircraft operating over North Vietnam of Vietnamese surface to air missile launches.

===Falklands War===
The Argentine Naval Aviation had received at least 16 Neptunes of different variants since 1958 including eight former RAF examples for use in the Escuadrilla Aeronaval de Exploración (&quot;Naval Exploration Squadron&quot;). They were intensively used in 1978 during the Operation Soberania against Chile including over the Pacific Ocean.

During the Falklands War in 1982, the last two airframes in service (2-P-111 and 2-P-112) carried out reconnaissance missions over the South Atlantic and on 4 May, after detecting a group of British warships, helped to direct an attack by two Dassault Super Étendards that resulted in the sinking of the British destroyer . The lack of spare parts, caused by the US having enacted an arms embargo in 1977 due to the &quot;Dirty War&quot;, led to the type being retired before the end of the war; Argentine Air Force Lockheed C-130 Hercules took over the task of searching for targets for strike aircraft.

===Other military operators===
The Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s Maritime Air Command replaced its aging Avro Lancaster maritime patrol aircraft beginning in 1955 with P2V-7 Neptunes in the anti-submarine, anti-shipping, and maritime reconnaissance roles, as a stopgap pending deliveries of the Canadair CP-107 Argus, which began in 1960. Canadian Neptunes were delivered without the underwing Westinghouse J34 jet engine pods, which were retrofitted in 1959. Armament included two torpedoes, mines, depth charges, bombs carried internally plus unguided rockets mounted under the wings. Twenty five Neptunes served with 404, 405 and 407 squadrons until 1960. Upon unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, the Neptune was re-designated the CP122 and was officially retired two years later.

Australia also acquired Neptunes to supplement and then replace the aging Avro Lincoln in the reconnaissance and anti-submarine role. The RAAF flew Neptunes from 1951 until 1978, at first with 11 Squadron (Pearce, WA) and then, from late 1953, with 10 Squadron (Richmond, NSW). RAAF Neptunes were fitted for ASW, surface ship detection and general reconnaissance. Twelve P2V4/5 (later designated P-2E) aircraft entered service with 11 Squadron in 1951. At first powered only by two R3350 radials, all were later retrofitted with Westinghouse J-34 auxiliary jets. Long-running severe spare parts shortages in the early 1950s made it necessary to put 6 of the 12 aircraft in long-term storage from 1953. In August 1953, the rear and front turrets were removed and replaced with a MAD boom and a clear Perspex nose for observation. In the late 1960s, RAAF Neptune operations were wound down and it was replaced with the P-3B Orion.

With the founding of NATO in 1949 and the resulting additional maritime commitments it entailed for Britain, The Royal Air Force Coastal Command operated 52 P2V-5s, designated Neptune MR.1, as a stop-gap modern maritime patrol aircraft until sufficient numbers of the Avro Shackleton could enter service. The Neptunes were used from between 1952 and March 1957, being used for airborne early warning experiments as well as for maritime patrol.

In Australia, the Netherlands, and the US Navy, its tasks were taken over by the larger and more capable P-3 Orion, and by the 1970s, it was in use only by patrol squadrons in the US Naval Reserve and the Dutch Navy. The 320 Squadron of the Royal Dutch Navy retired its last seven Neptunes in March 1982 as they were being replaced by the Lockheed Orion. The US Naval Reserve retired its last Neptunes in 1978, those aircraft also having been replaced by the P-3 Orion. By the 1980s, the Neptune had fallen out of military use in most purchasing nations, replaced by newer aircraft.

The Netherlands received its first Neptunes in 1953–54, when it acquired 12 P2V-5s. These remained in service until 1960, when they were transferred to Portugal. The P2V-5s were initially not replaced, with the anti-submarine aircraft requirement being met by carrier-borne Grumman S-2 Trackers. A new, urgent, requirement for maritime patrol aircraft soon developed, for service over Dutch New Guinea, and 15 new P2V-7s were purchased, entering service from September 1961. While initially employed on reconnaissance and patrol duties, as Indonesian infiltration attempts against New Guinea increased, the Neptunes added bombing and strafing operations to their patrol duties. On 17 May 1962, a Netherlands Navy Neptune shot down an Indonesian C-47 transport. A truce ended the conflict in September 1962, with Dutch New Guinea passing to UN control before becoming part of Indonesia, and the P2V-7s returned to Europe. The aircraft were upgraded to SP-2H standard soon after returning to the Netherlands, and remained in service until March 1982, when they were replaced by Lockheed Orions.

In Japan, the Neptune was license-built from 1966 by Kawasaki as the P-2J, with the piston engines replaced by IHI-built T64 turboprops. Kawasaki continued their manufacture much later than Lockheed did; the P-2J remained in service until 1984.

===Civilian firefighting===
P-2/P2Vs have been employed in aerial firefighting roles by operators such as Minden Air Corp and Neptune Aviation Services. The fire fighters can carry of retardant and have a service life of 15,000 hours. Neptune Aviation Services proposes to replace them with British Aerospace 146 aircraft, which have an estimated service life of 80,000 hours and carry upwards of of retardant.

===&quot;The Truculent Turtle&quot;===
The third production P2V-1 was chosen for a record-setting mission, ostensibly to test crew endurance and long-range navigation but also for publicity purposes: to display the capabilities of the US Navy&#x27;s latest patrol bomber, and to surpass the standing record set by a Japanese Tachikawa Ki-77. Its nickname was &quot;The Turtle&quot;, which was painted on the aircraft&#x27;s nose (along with a cartoon of a turtle smoking a pipe pedaling a device attached to a propeller). However, in press releases immediately before the flight, the US Navy referred to it as &quot;The Truculent Turtle&quot;.
Loaded with fuel in extra tanks fitted in practically every spare space in the aircraft, &quot;The Turtle&quot; set out from Perth, Australia to the United States. With a crew of four (and a nine-month-old gray kangaroo, a gift from Australia for the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.) the aircraft set off on 9 September 1946, with a RATO (rocket-assisted takeoff). days (55h, 18m) later, &quot;The Turtle&quot; touched down in Columbus, Ohio after . It was the longest un-refueled flight yet beating the unofficial record set by the Japanese Tachikawa Ki-77. This would stand as the absolute unrefueled distance record until 1962 when it was beaten by a USAF Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, and would remain as a piston-engined record until 1986 when the Rutan Voyager broke it circumnavigating the globe. &quot;The Turtle&quot; is preserved at the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 27 November 1950 a P2V-2 crashed while conducting a test run with rockets near Kaena Point in Hawaii. The starboard wing separated from the aircraft. The crew of five died on impact.
* On 6 November 1951, a P2V of VP-6 carrying out a reconnaissance mission over international waters off Vladivostok was attacked and shot down by a number of MiG-15s. All ten crew were killed.
* On 5 January 1952, a Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune (122443) operated by the United States Navy undershot the runway at RAF Burtonwood and collided with a USAF Douglas C-47 (42-100912). One crew member on the Neptune and six others on the C-47 were killed. Fifteen others were injured, eleven on the Neptune and four on the C-47.
* On 18 January 1953, a P2V of VP-22 was shot down off Swatow in the Formosa Straits by Chinese anti-aircraft fire. Eleven of thirteen crewmen were rescued by a US Coast Guard PBM-5 under fire from shore batteries on Nan Ao Tao island. Attempting to takeoff in 8 to 12-foot swell, the PBM crashed. Ten survivors out of nineteen total (including five from the P2V) were rescued by . During the search effort, a PBM-5 from VP-40 received fire from a small-caliber machine gun, and received fire from shore batteries.
* On 17 December 1953, P2V-5 Neptune S/N (BUN 12388) of VP-3 with a nine men crew, disappeared on a patrol flight from Keflavík Airport, an airfield near Iceland capital of Reykjavík. The Neptune took off from Keflavík at 2 pm. Thursday for routine patrol over North Atlantic waters. It was circling back through a storm toward that base when it radioed its last position. The wreck was sighted on Mýrdalsjökull glacier and at least three of the nine men crew were initially reported alive. A United States air rescue plane spotted the wreckage, which was described as &quot;badly broken up&quot;. Helicopter lift recovered one body, but bodies of 8 men remain in the frozen wreck until spring (1954). On 14 October 1982, the remains of American crewmen was found 28 years after the crash into the glacier. The wreck was discovered by farmers rounding up sheep, apparently the glacier movement uncovered the wreck. The crew was LT Henry Cason, LT Ishmuel M. Blum, ENS Sven Shieff, AD2 Eddie L. Cater, AN Everett Humbert, AT3 Amos W. Jones, AL2 Robert B. Whale, AO3 Marvin L Baker, ATAN William A. Ward.
* On 4 September 1954, a P2V-5 of VP-19 operating from NAS Atsugi ditched in the Sea of Japan, off the coast of Siberia after an attack by two Soviet Air Forces MiG-15s. One crewmen was killed, and the other nine were rescued by a USAF SA-16 Grumman Albatross amphibian.
* On 22 June 1955, a P2V-5 of VP-9, flying a patrol mission from NAS Kodiak, Alaska, was attacked over the Bering Straits by two Soviet Air Forces MiG-15s. The P2V crash-landed on St. Lawrence Island after an engine was set afire. Of the eleven crew members, four sustained injuries due to gunfire and six were injured during the landing. The US government demanded $724,947 in compensation; the USSR finally paid half this amount.
* On 26 September 1955, a P2V-3W (131442), callsign &quot;Snowcloud Five&quot;, was lost south of Jamaica while attempting to penetrate the center of Hurricane Janet with nine crew and two journalists aboard; despite an extensive search and rescue effort over the next five days involving 3,000 personnel, 60 aircraft, and seven ships, no trace of the aircraft or its occupants was ever found. This remains the only loss of a reconnaissance aircraft during penetration of an Atlantic hurricane. The cause of the crash is unknown, although theories include an incorrect altimeter reading due the low barometric pressure in the hurricane and increased workload due to one of the usual crew members having been replaced by a reporter causing the crew to lose track of their height above the sea.
* On 10 October 1956, a P2V-5 of No. 36 Squadron RAF (WX545) crashed into the side of Beinn na Lice, Mull of Kintyre, southwest Scotland, killing all nine crew members. WX545 was returning from an anti-submarine exercise off Derry, Northern Ireland to its base at RAF Topcliffe in North Yorkshire, England. Beinn na Lice was hidden by fog, and a member of 36 Squadron alleges that the aircraft in the exercise had been ordered not to use radar in inshore waters.
* On 12 April 1957, a P2V-5F of VP-26 crashed on takeoff during a short takeoff practice exercise at NAS Brunswick, Maine. The apparent cause was a runaway varicam elevator control, which caused a hammerhead stall at very low altitude. The aircraft did an overhead loop, reversing its direction, but crashed into the woods near the departure end of the runway next to the base golf course. There were no survivors.
* On 21 July 1957, a US Navy Neptune searching for a sister P2V Neptune crashed near Mount Pra, Italy, near the French border, killing nine airmen. The other P2V for had disappeared two days earlier, 19 July, with 11 on board on a flight from Casablanca to Treviso.
* On 1 February 1958, USAF C-118A 53-3277 collided in mid-air with a US Navy Lockheed P2V Neptune 127723 over Norwalk, California, killing 47 of 49 on board both aircraft and 1 person on the ground.
* On 4 February 1959, RAAF A89-308 crashed at RAAF Richmond, NSW, Australia. All eight crew died. The port engine began to disintegrate, causing a fuel leak in the wheel well. The resulting fire severed the magnesium wing spar, and the aircraft fell from the sky before the crew could bail out.
* On 25 March 1960, an ROCAF RB-69A/P2V-7U (7101/140442/54-4040) crashed into a hill near Kunsan Air Base, South Korea, during a low-level ferry flight from Hsinchu, Taiwan to a staging area in Kunsan, South Korea. All 14 aircrew on board were killed.
* On 6 November 1961, an ROCAF RB-69A/P2V-7U (7099/140440/54-4039) conducting a low-level penetration flight over mainland China was shot down by ground fire over Liaodong peninsula. All 14 aircrew on board were killed in action.
* On 9 November 1961, an P2V-7LP of VX-6 crashed on takeoff from Wilkes Station, Antarctica, where it had refuelled en route to McMurdo Station. Four aircrew and one passenger were killed, with four aircrew surviving.
* On 8 January 1962, a ROCAF RB-69A/P2V-7U(7097/140438/54-4038) crashed into the Korea Bay while conducting ELINT and leaflet dropping missions. All 14 aircrew on board were killed in action.
* On 12 January 1962, a P2V-5 (designation LA-9) of VP-5 flew off course during a patrol over the Denmark Strait and crashed on the Kronborg Glacier in eastern Greenland. All 12 crew were killed. The wreckage was discovered by a party of British geologists in 1966.
* On 19 June 1963, an ROCAF RB-69A/P2V-7U (7105/141233/54-4041) was conducting an ELINT mission over mainland China, and was shot down by PLAAF MiG-17PF over Linchuan, Jiangxi, after being intercepted repeatedly by multiple MiG-17PFs and Tu-4Ps. All 14 aircrew on board were killed in action.
* On 11 June 1964, a RB-69A/P2V-7U (7047/135612/54-4037) was conducting an ELINT mission over mainland China and was shot down by a PLAN-AF MiG-15 over Shandong peninsula after being intercepted by MiG-15s and Il-28s. All 13 aircrew on board were killed in action.
* On 22 January 1965, an RCAF P2V-7 #24115 crashed short of the runway at CFB Summerside, Prince Edward Island, when it ran out of battery power to run the fuel pumps to the J-34 jet engines. The aircraft had lost one reciprocating engine, and the generator failed on the other. Also, because Canadian Neptunes had no other generators, these failures led to the loss of all thrust and the subsequent crash.
* On 22 January 1965, just before midnight, an MLD SP-2H (212) was taken from Vliegkamp Valkenburg, near The Hague, by two young aircraft mechanics lacking any flying experience. They managed to get the plane airborne, but stalled shortly after takeoff. It crashed into the North Sea, a few hundred metres offshore of the fishing town of Katwijk. The investigation report concluded that it was a drunken prank.
* On 3 December 1967, a Lockheed P-2E aircraft departed Naval Air Station Brunswick for a routine patrol flight. At some point, the aircraft developed mechanical problems and received clearance to land at Otis Air Force Base. As the aircraft was making its final approach, it crashed a half mile short of the runway. All twelve men aboard escaped; four of them suffered minor injuries. 
* On 4 February 1970 at 4:39 a.m, French Navy Lockheed P2V7 Neptune No. 147571 of Flotilla 25F crashed after takeoff, killing all 12 crew members.
* On 15 January 1971, French Navy Lockheed P2V7 Neptune No. 147564 of Flottilla 25F crashed at the start of runway 26 on the Lann-Bihoué naval aeronautics base, in the final phase of a landing in foggy weather, killing 6 of the 10 crew.
* On 15 September 1976, an Argentine Navy Lockheed Neptune aircraft flew on a reconnaissance mission from Rio Gallegos to survey the sea ice conditions in Drake Passage at the beginning of the summer navigation season. The plane crashed in poor weather on the then-uninhabited Livingston Island, Antarctica, killing all 10 aircrew and a civilian television cameraman.
* On 5 September 2008, a Neptune Aviation Services Lockheed Neptune, registered N4235T, crashed soon after takeoff from Reno/Stead Airport, Reno, Nevada. The left engine and then left wing were seen to catch fire before the aircraft crashed. All three crew members on board were killed.
* On 3 June 2012, while engaged in firefighting operations in Utah, a Neptune Aviation Services Lockheed Neptune, registered N14447, crashed. Two crew members were killed.

<doc id="496558" wikidata="Q198740" url="?curid=496558" title="Law of the iterated logarithm">
<text>In probability theory, the law of the iterated logarithm describes the magnitude of the fluctuations of a random walk. The original statement of the law of the iterated logarithm is due to A. Ya. Khinchin (1924). Another statement was given by A. N. Kolmogorov in 1929.

==Statement==
Let {&quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot;} be independent, identically distributed random variables with zero means and unit variances. Let &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;Y&quot;1 + ... + &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Then
: formula_1
where &quot;log&quot; is the natural logarithm, &quot;lim sup&quot; denotes the limit superior, and &quot;a.s.&quot; stands for &quot;almost surely&quot;.

Another statement given by A. N. Kolmogorov in 1929 is as follows.

Let formula_2 be independent random variables with zero means and finite variances. Let formula_3 and formula_4. If formula_5 and there exists a sequence of positive constants formula_6 such that formula_7 a.s. and
: formula_8
then we have
: formula_9

Note that, the first statement covers the case of the standard normal distribution, but the second does not.

==Discussion==
The law of iterated logarithms operates &quot;in between&quot; the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. There are two versions of the law of large numbers — the weak and the strong — and they both state that the sums &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;, scaled by &quot;n&quot;−1, converge to zero, respectively in probability and almost surely:
: formula_10

On the other hand, the central limit theorem states that the sums &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; scaled by the factor &quot;n&quot;−1/2 converge in distribution to a standard normal distribution. By Kolmogorov&#x27;s zero–one law, for any fixed &quot;M&quot;, the probability that the event
formula_11
occurs is 0 or 1.
Then

: formula_12

so

:formula_13

An identical argument shows that

:formula_14

This implies that these quantities cannot converge almost surely. In fact, they cannot even converge in probability, which follows from the equality

:formula_15

and the fact that the random variables

:formula_16

are independent and both converge in distribution to formula_17

The &quot;law of the iterated logarithm&quot; provides the scaling factor where the two limits become different:
: formula_18

Thus, although the absolute value of the quantity formula_19 is less than any predefined &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 with probability approaching one, it will nevertheless almost surely be greater than &quot;ε&quot; infinitely often; in fact, the quantity will be visiting the neighborhoods of any point in the interval (-1,1) almost surely.
==Generalizations and variants==

The law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for a sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with zero mean and bounded increment dates back to Khinchin and Kolmogorov in the 1920s.

Since then, there has been a tremendous amount of work on the LIL for various kinds of
dependent structures and for stochastic processes. The following is a small sample of notable developments.

Hartman–Wintner (1940) generalized LIL to random walks with increments with zero mean and finite variance. De Acosta (1983) gave a simple proof of the Hartman–Wintner version of the LIL.

Chung (1948) proved another version of the law of the iterated logarithm for the absolute value of a brownian motion.

Strassen (1964) studied the LIL from the point of view of invariance principles.

Stout (1970) generalized the LIL to stationary ergodic martingales.

Wittmann (1985) generalized Hartman–Wintner version of LIL to random walks satisfying milder conditions.

Vovk (1987) derived a version of LIL valid for a single chaotic sequence (Kolmogorov random sequence). This is notable, as it is outside the realm of classical probability theory.

Yongge Wang (1996) showed that the law of the iterated logarithm holds for polynomial time pseudorandom sequences also. The Java-based software testing tool tests whether a pseudorandom generator outputs sequences that satisfy the LIL.

Balsubramani (2014) proved a non-asymptotic LIL that holds over finite-time martingale sample paths. This subsumes the martingale LIL as it provides matching finite-sample concentration and anti-concentration bounds, and enables sequential testing and other applications.

<text>Vincent Lamar Carter Jr. (born January 26, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 22 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He primarily played the shooting guard and small forward positions, but occasionally played power forward later in his NBA career. An eight-time All-Star and a two-time All-NBA Team selection, he played a record 22 seasons in the NBA, tied with LeBron James for the most seasons played in league history. He is also the only player to have played in the NBA in four different decades. In 2024, Carter was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

Carter entertained crowds with his leaping ability and slam dunks, earning him nicknames such as &quot;Vinsanity&quot;, &quot;Air Canada&quot; (a play on the Canadian airline of the same name), and &quot;Half Man, Half Amazing&quot;. He has been ranked as the greatest dunker of all time by numerous players, journalists, and by the National Basketball Association (NBA).
His Dunk of Death against France during the 2000 Summer Olympics is widely considered one of the greatest and most famous of all time.

In addition to his dunking prowess, Carter was a prolific three-point shooter, making the tenth most three-point field goals in league history. Various contemporaries have called him the league&#x27;s &quot;most gifted/talented&quot; player.

A high school McDonald&#x27;s All-American, Carter played college basketball for three years with the North Carolina Tar Heels and twice advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament. He was selected with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, who traded him to the Toronto Raptors. Carter emerged as a global star in Toronto, winning the 1999 NBA Rookie of the Year Award and the Slam Dunk Contest at the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend. He represented the United States in the 2000 Summer Olympics, where he led the team in scoring and captured a gold medal. In December 2004, Carter was traded to the New Jersey Nets, where he continued his offensive success. He also played for the Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings, and Atlanta Hawks. He received the Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award in 2016. Off the court, Carter established the Embassy of Hope Foundation, helping children and their families in Florida, New Jersey and Ontario. He was recognized in 2000 as Child Advocate of the Year by the Children&#x27;s Home Society, and received the Florida Governor&#x27;s Points of Light award in 2007 for his philanthropy in his home state. Carter was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Early life==
Born in Daytona Beach, Florida, Carter is the son of Michelle and Vincent Carter Sr. His parents divorced when he was seven. His mother remarried several times.

Carter attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach. He played football as a quarterback until a broken wrist in his freshman year forced him to switch to volleyball. In volleyball, he was named the Volusia County Player of the Year as a junior and averaged 24 kills per match; for comparison, none of his teammates averaged more than one. He was also offered a saxophone scholarship to attend Bethune–Cookman University in Daytona Beach.

He led Mainland&#x27;s basketball team to its first Class 6A state title in 56 years, and was a 1995 McDonald&#x27;s All-American. On January 31, 2012, he was designated one of the 35 greatest McDonald&#x27;s All-Americans.
In his senior year he averaged 22 points, 11.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 3.5 blocks per game. Carter&#x27;s career totals at Mainland are 2,299 points, 1,042 rebounds, 356 assists and 178 steals. He was contacted by 77 NCAA Division I schools but ultimately chose North Carolina over Florida.

==College==
Carter enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1995. He is a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

He played three seasons of college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels under Dean Smith and later Bill Guthridge. During the 1997–98 season, he was a member of new coach Guthridge&#x27;s &quot;Six Starters&quot; system that also featured Antawn Jamison, Shammond Williams, Ed Cota, Ademola Okulaja, and Makhtar N&#x27;Diaye. During his sophomore and junior seasons, Carter helped North Carolina to consecutive ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament titles and Final Four appearances. He finished the 1997–98 season with a 15.6 points per game average and was named second-team All-American, First-Team All-ACC, and to the fan&#x27;s guide third-annual Coaches ACC All-Defensive Team. In May 1998 after his junior year, Carter declared for the 1998 NBA draft, following his classmate Jamison, who had declared earlier that spring.

During his NBA career, Carter continued his coursework at North Carolina, and in August 2000, he graduated with a degree in Afro-American studies, squeezing in attendance at May 2001 graduation ceremonies at North Carolina before leaving to make a Raptors&#x27; playoff game in Philadelphia.

==Professional career==

===Toronto Raptors (1998–2004)===
Carter was initially drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft. He was then immediately traded to the Toronto Raptors for the fourth overall pick, Antawn Jamison on draft night. The Raptors had struggled in their first three years as a franchise. Carter was instrumental in leading the Raptors to their first-ever playoff appearance in 2000 before going on to lead them to a 47-win season and their first-ever playoff series win in 2001, advancing them to the Eastern Conference Semifinals.
Due to the 1998–99 NBA lockout, Carter did not begin playing in the NBA until February 1999. Carter quickly became a fan favorite with a soaring offensive game that earned him the nickname &quot;Air Canada&quot;. He won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 18.3 points and throwing down countless highlight-reel dunks. Carter ascended to full-fledged stardom in his second season—he averaged 25.7 points per game (fourth-highest in the league) and lifted Toronto to its first playoff appearance in franchise history. He subsequently earned his first NBA All-Star selection and was named to the All-NBA Third Team. During the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend, Carter showcased arguably the most memorable Slam Dunk Contest event in its history. He won the contest by performing an array of dunks including a 360° windmill, a between-the-legs bounce dunk, and an &quot;elbow in the rim&quot; dunk (also known as a &quot;cookie jar&quot; dunk or the &quot;honey dip&quot;). Carter and his second cousin once removed, Tracy McGrady, formed a formidable one-two punch as teammates in Toronto between 1998 and 2000. However, McGrady left in free agency to the Orlando Magic in August 2000, leaving Carter as the Raptors&#x27; franchise player.

In 2000–01, his third season, Carter averaged a career-high 27.6 points per game, made the All-NBA Second Team, and was voted in as a starter for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game. The Raptors finished the regular season with a then franchise-record 47 wins. In the playoffs, the Raptors beat the New York Knicks 3–2 in the first round and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals to face off against the Philadelphia 76ers. Carter and 76ers star Allen Iverson both dominated in a seven-game series that see-sawed back and forth. Carter scored 50 points in Game 3 and set an NBA playoff record for most three-point field goals made in one game. In Game 7, Carter missed a potential game-winning shot with 2.0 seconds remaining. Iverson said of the series in July 2011: &quot;It was incredible. (Carter) had great games at home and I had some great games at home, but both of us were just trying to put our teams on our back and win basketball games. It is great just having those memories and being a part of something like that.&quot;

In August 2001, Carter signed a six-year contract extension worth as much as $94 million. Carter missed the final 22 games of the 2001–02 regular season due to injury. He started in 60 games and averaged 24.7 points per game. On December 7, 2001, Carter recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 steals against the Denver Nuggets. He joined Charles Barkley (1988) as just the second player ever to finish a game with 40 points, 15 rebounds, five steals and five assists, dating back to the 1973–74 season, when the league began officially tracking steals. He was voted into the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, but he could not participate due to injury. Without Carter during the playoffs, the Raptors were defeated in five games by the Detroit Pistons in the first round.

Following off-season surgery, Carter only managed 43 games during the 2002–03 season. In February 2003, Carter gave up his starting spot in the 2003 NBA All-Star Game to Michael Jordan to allow Jordan to make his final start as an All-Star. Carter played in 73 games during the 2003–04 season, but the Raptors fell three games short of making the playoffs.

====Trade to the Nets====
During the 2004 off-season, general manager Glen Grunwald and the entire coaching staff were fired. Following trade rumours all season long, on December 17, 2004, new general manager Rob Babcock traded Carter to the New Jersey Nets for Alonzo Mourning, Aaron Williams, Eric Williams and two first round draft picks.

In his first game back in Toronto, on April 15, 2005, Carter was heavily booed and jeered by Raptors fans. Carter would finish with 39 points in a 101–90 New Jersey victory. Carter continued to receive similar treatment for years to come in the town that once embraced him. Despite this, he thrived on many occasions in Toronto as a Net. On January 8, 2006, after a missed free throw by the Raptors, Carter hit a long three pointer at the other end with 0.1 seconds left to seal a 105–104 win to shock the Toronto crowd. Afterwards Carter, who finished with 42 points, referred to it among his greatest shots ever saying &quot;That&#x27;s definitely number one. The atmosphere, the emotion, the hostility in the arena, it was a fun game.&quot; On November 21, 2008, Carter&#x27;s late game heroics sent the game into overtime where he would hit another game winner doing so on an inbounds alley-oop dunk with 1.5 seconds left in a 129–127 victory. Carter scored 39 points and regarding the continued booing he insisted he held no grudges to the fans &quot;I know, deep down, that&#x27;s just sports, that&#x27;s the way it goes. I root for my team and I&#x27;m a terrible fan.&quot;

In November 2011, Carter, along with Tracy McGrady and Charles Oakley, addressed the Toronto audience in an interview on &quot;Off the Record with Michael Landsberg&quot;. When asked about being booed in Toronto, Carter said, &quot;They watched myself and Tracy grow up. And when we left they still got to see (us) flourish and become (who we are). For me, I looked at it as, a young child growing up into a grown man and moving on. And I get it. Leaving, hurt a lot of people. It hurt me because I tell you what... I accomplished a lot, I learned a lot, I became the person and player of who I am today because of that experience, through the coaches, players, and everything else. I get it... but regardless I still love the city. I have friends there and my heart is still there because that&#x27;s where it all started.&quot; Later in the interview, when asked about any words to the Toronto fans, Carter said, &quot;I appreciate the fans and whether you cheer for me, boo me, or hate me, I still love you. Toronto&#x27;s one of the best kept secrets... puts one of the best products on the floor and one of the top places to play in.&quot;

On November 6, 2012, in an interview with TSN Radio 1050, Carter reiterated his love for the city and his appreciation for the Toronto Raptors organization. The next day, Sam Mitchell and Rob Babcock revealed on Sportsnet 590, The Fan that the night before Carter was traded to New Jersey, Carter phoned Mitchell to express his desire to stay in Toronto. However, Babcock said it was too late and the trade had already been verbally agreed upon. Looking back on it, Mitchell feels he should have personally contacted the MLSE chairman, Larry Tanenbaum, but was reluctant because he did not want to break the chain of command.

Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri referred to Carter in April 2014 as &quot;one of the symbols of the Toronto Raptors.&quot; To this day, Carter remains as one of the Raptors&#x27; elite scorers in franchise history having amassed 9,420 points and is Toronto&#x27;s all-time leader in points per game, box plus/minus and player efficiency rating during his -year run in Toronto.

On November 19, 2014, nearly a decade after the trade, as a part of the Raptors&#x27; 20th anniversary celebration, the team paid tribute to Carter with a video montage during the first quarter of the Raptors–Grizzlies game. Leading up to the game, questions were raised about how Raptors fans would receive the planned video tribute. As the sellout crowd watched the video tribute featuring highlights of Carter&#x27;s high-flying Raptors days, what began as the usual booing turned into an overwhelmingly positive standing ovation. An emotional Carter used his warm-up shirt to wipe tears running down his face as he pointed to his heart and waved to the fans in appreciation. He later stated, &quot;It was a great feeling, I couldn&#x27;t write it any better.&quot;

===New Jersey Nets (2004–2009)===

Carter was acquired by the New Jersey Nets on December 17, 2004, playing five seasons for them before departing in June 2009. Carter produced some of his highest numbers with the Nets, surpassing his 23.4 points per game with the Raptors to average 23.6 points per game over his tenure in New Jersey. He missed just 11 games in his four full seasons and helped lead the Nets to three straight playoff runs between 2005 and 2007.

Carter joined a Nets team with Jason Kidd and Richard Jefferson as the leading players. However, the trio never got to play together at full strength during the 2004–05 season. Carter and Kidd carried a shallow roster on a 15–4 run to end the season to make the playoffs.
In the 2005–06 season, the Carter-Kidd duo co-led the Nets to 49 wins, an Atlantic Division title, and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs. Carter helped lead the Nets to the second round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual NBA champions Miami Heat in five games. Carter averaged 29.6 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists in 11 playoff games. Carter was named an Eastern Conference All-Star in 2006. On November 7, 2005, Carter threw down a very memorable dunk against the Miami Heat, over defensive stalwart, Alonzo Mourning. On December 23, 2005, Carter set an NBA record for the most free throws made in a quarter (4th quarter) with 16 against Miami. He tied his career-high of 51 points in the same game.

In the 2006–07 season, Carter was named as a reserve to the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, marking his eighth All-Star appearance. In a 120–114 overtime win over the Washington Wizards on April 7, 2007, Carter and Kidd became the first teammates in over 18 years to record triple-doubles in the same game since the Chicago Bulls&#x27; Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen achieved this feat against the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989. Carter finished with 46 points, a career-high 16 rebounds, and 10 assists. Kidd finished with 10 points, tied a career high with 16 rebounds, and tied a season high with 18 assists. Carter finished the 2006–07 season playing all 82 games, averaging over 25 points with a 21 PER.

In July 2007, Carter re-signed with the Nets to a four-year, $61.8 million contract.

During the 2007–08 season, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks. Carter was credited for becoming a leader following the All-Star break. He became captain of the Nets, and in 2008–09, he and teammate Devin Harris were the highest-scoring starting backcourt in the league. On November 21, 2008, Carter scored a season-high 39 points, including a game winning two-handed reverse dunk, as the Nets battled back from an 18-point deficit to defeat the Toronto Raptors 129–127 in overtime at the Air Canada Centre. He hit a 29-foot, game tying three-pointer to send the game into overtime and then scored the winning basket in the extra period. On February 3, 2009, Carter recorded his fifth career triple-double with 15 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 99–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.

===Orlando Magic (2009–2010)===

On June 25, 2009, Carter was traded, along with Ryan Anderson, to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Rafer Alston, Tony Battie and Courtney Lee. Orlando hoped Carter would provide center Dwight Howard with a perimeter scorer who can create his own shot—something the Magic had lacked when they were defeated in the 2009 NBA Finals by the Los Angeles Lakers. On February 8, 2010, Carter had a season-high 48 points, 34 in the second half, when the Magic rallied from a 17-point deficit to defeat the New Orleans Hornets 123–117. Carter helped the Magic reach the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics.

===Phoenix Suns (2010–2011)===

On December 18, 2010, Carter was acquired by the Phoenix Suns along with Marcin Gortat, Mickael Pietrus, and a first-round draft pick in 2011 NBA draft in exchange for Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkoglu, and Earl Clark. On January 17, 2011, Carter recorded 29 points and 12 rebounds in a 129–121 win over the New York Knicks. He reached 20,000 career points during the game, becoming the 37th NBA player to reach that plateau.

On December 9, 2011, following the conclusion of the NBA lockout, Carter was waived by the Suns, meaning the team only had to pay him $4 million of the $18 million he was due for the 2011–12 season. Carter appeared in 51 games with 41 starts, averaging 13.5 points while shooting 42 percent.

===Dallas Mavericks (2011–2014)===
On December 12, 2011, Carter signed a three-year contract with the defending NBA champion Dallas Mavericks. This move reunited Carter with former Nets teammate Jason Kidd. On April 20, 2012, against the Golden State Warriors, Carter became the eighth player in NBA history with 1,500 3-pointers when he made one in the closing minutes.

While known early on in his career for his circus dunks, Carter became known for his 3-point shooting with the Mavericks. On February 13, 2013, in a 123–100 win over the Sacramento Kings, Carter scored 26 points to pass Larry Bird on the NBA&#x27;s career scoring list, moving him into 29th place. Carter turned aside a Sacramento rally in the third quarter by going 5 of 7 from long range and scoring 17 of Dallas&#x27; last 21 points in the period. He ended the night with 21,796 career points for 29th on the all-time list, five ahead of Bird. He also became the 11th NBA player with at least 1,600 3-pointers. He finished the season ranked 27th on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list with 22,223 career points. His 162 3-pointers tied his career high for 3s made in a season (162-of-397, .408, with Toronto in 2000–01). Over the course of the season, he advanced from 17th place to 11th place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time 3-point field goals made list (passing Nick Van Exel, Tim Hardaway, Eddie Jones, Glen Rice, Jason Richardson and Kobe Bryant), finishing the year with 1,663 career 3-pointers.

Prior to the 2013–14 season, Carter established himself as the Mavericks&#x27; sixth man, after the departure of Jason Terry. He averaged just 10.5 points and shot 37.6% from the field during the first 22 games of the season due to increased responsibilities and pressure to be the team&#x27;s lone scoring punch off of the bench. He saw his numbers improve in December, averaging 12.5 points and shooting 44.3% from the field during an 18-game stretch. On March 16, 2014, against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Carter raised his career total to 23,010 points, becoming the 27th NBA player to pass the 23,000-point mark with a 3-pointer with 2:17 left in the third quarter. In Game 3 of the Mavericks&#x27; first-round playoff series against the San Antonio Spurs, Carter drilled the game-winning 3-pointer with no time remaining on the clock to give the eighth-seeded Mavericks a 109–108 win and a 2–1 series edge over the top-seeded Spurs. The Mavericks went on to lose the series in seven games.

===Memphis Grizzlies (2014–2017)===

==== 2014–15 season ====
On July 12, 2014, Carter signed a multi-year deal with the Memphis Grizzlies. On November 13, 2014, he made a game winning alley-oop assist from the sideline to teammate Courtney Lee at the buzzer to win the game 111–110 over the Sacramento Kings. On December 17, 2014, Carter scored a season-high 18 points in a 117–116 triple overtime win over the San Antonio Spurs. Carter moved into 25th in all-time NBA scoring during the game, passing Robert Parish (23,334).

==== 2015–16 season ====
Carter appeared in just one of the Grizzlies&#x27; first 12 games of the 2015–16 season. On February 24, 2016, with nine points scored against the Los Angeles Lakers, Carter passed Charles Barkley (23,757) for 24th in career points scored. Two days later, he scored a season-high 19 points in a 112–95 win over the Lakers. For the latter half of April and the whole first round playoff series against the Spurs, Carter was inserted in the starting lineup and played well. In Game 1 against the Spurs, Carter scored a team-high 16 points in a 106–74 loss. The Grizzlies went on to lose the series in four games. After finishing second behind Tim Duncan in the 2014–15 season, Carter was awarded with the Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award for the 2015–16 season. The award recognizes the player deemed the best teammate based on selfless play, on- and off-court leadership as a mentor and role model to other NBA players, and commitment and dedication to team.

==== 2016–17 season ====
On November 1, 2016, Carter played in his 1,278th NBA game, tying him with A.C. Green for 25th on the NBA&#x27;s career list. He also became the 24th player in NBA history to surpass 24,000 career points. On November 8, he scored 20 points against the Denver Nuggets and became the oldest player in the NBA to post a 20-point game since Michael Jordan scored 25 for the Washington Wizards in April 2003, at age 40. It was also Carter&#x27;s first 20-point game since April 30, 2014. On November 12, Carter made seven field goals against the Milwaukee Bucks to pass Gary Payton (8,708) for 21st in NBA history. Carter also passed Charles Oakley for 24th on the NBA&#x27;s career games played list with 1,283. On November 14, in a win over the Utah Jazz, Carter had his second 20-point game of the season, joining Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing as the only players in NBA history to put up 20 points and 5+ rebounds off the bench at the age of 39, with Carter being the oldest at 39 years and 287 days. Carter missed seven games in early December with a right hip flexor strain. On January 11, Carter hit his 1,989th career three-pointer to move ahead of Jason Kidd and into fifth on the all-time list. On February 1, in a game against the Denver Nuggets, Carter hit his 2,000th career three-pointer, making him only the fifth player to ever reach that mark. On February 6 against San Antonio, Carter joined Karl Malone, Dikembe Mutombo, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish as the only 40-year-old players to record at least four blocks in a game. On February 15, in a game against the New Orleans Pelicans, Carter passed Allen Iverson for 23rd on the NBA all-time scoring list. On March 13, Carter made his first start of the season and made all eight of his shots, including six from beyond the arc, to score a season-high 24 points and lead the Grizzlies past the Milwaukee Bucks 113–93. He became the first 40-year-old in NBA history to hit six triples in one game. At 40 years, 46 days old, Carter also became the oldest player to start an NBA game since Juwan Howard in April 2013. On March 29 against the Indiana Pacers, Carter passed Ray Allen for 22nd on the NBA all-time scoring list. In the Grizzlies&#x27; regular-season finale on April 12 against the Dallas Mavericks, Carter played in his 1,347th game and passed Kobe Bryant for 13th in regular-season games played. On April 22, Carter became the first 40-year-old to make three or more 3-pointers in a playoff game during Game 4 of the Grizzlies&#x27; first-round series against the San Antonio Spurs.

===Sacramento Kings (2017–2018)===

On July 10, 2017, Carter signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Sacramento Kings. On August 18, 2017, during the Players Voice Awards, Carter was named by the NBA Players Association as the Most Influential Veteran. Carter missed seven games early in the season with a kidney stone. On December 27, 2017, Carter scored a season-high 24 points in a 109–95 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. It was the first time in NBA history that a 40-plus-year-old reserve scored at least 20 points in a game. He shot 10-of-12 from the field in 30 minutes off the bench, with his 83 percent shooting marking the second highest percentage of his career.

===Atlanta Hawks (2018–2020)===

==== 2018–19 season ====
On August 24, 2018, Carter signed with the Atlanta Hawks. In his debut for the Hawks on October 17, 2018, Carter started at forward and scored 12 points in a 126–107 loss to the New York Knicks, becoming the second oldest player in NBA history to start a season opener at 41 years and 264 days old. Only Robert Parish (42 years and 65 days old) was an older opening-night NBA starter than Carter. On November 21, he scored 14 points off the bench in a 124–108 loss to the Toronto Raptors, and became the 22nd player in NBA history to reach 25,000 career points. The milestone moment, which happened in the final seconds of the game, was made even more memorable for coming via a slam dunk and also for coming against his original team who joined in congratulating him on the court. On December 29, he scored an equal team-high 21 points in 111–108 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. It was his first game with 20 points for Atlanta and became the oldest player in history to lead or tie for the team lead in scoring. He also became the oldest player in NBA history to score 20+ points at 41 years and 337 days old, breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s record by 6 days. On February 7, 2019, against the Raptors, Carter passed Jerry West for 21st on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list. On March 1, 2019, he logged the second-most minutes for the Hawks in a 168–161 quadruple-overtime loss to the Chicago Bulls. At 42, Carter became the oldest player in NBA history to play at least 45 minutes in a game. On March 4, he scored 21 points, all on 3-pointers, in a 114–113 loss to the Miami Heat. He thus surpassed Reggie Miller for 20th on the all-time scoring list, passed Jamal Crawford for sixth on the all-time 3-point field goals made list, became the oldest player to shoot seven 3-pointers, and broke his own record of being the oldest player to score 20+ points in a game at 42 years old. On March 31, against the Milwaukee Bucks, Carter passed Karl Malone for fifth place on the all-time games played list with his 1,477th game.

==== 2019–20 season ====
In June 2019, Carter stated that he was planning to retire at the end of the 2019–20 NBA season. On September 20, 2019, Carter re-signed with the Hawks and played his first game on October 24, 2019, making his 22nd season official. Four of Carter&#x27;s teammates were born after he was drafted in 1998. On December 10, 2019, he became the fifth player in NBA history to play at least 1,500 games. On January 4, 2020, during a 116–111 win over the Indiana Pacers, Carter became the only player in NBA history to have played in four different decades. On January 22, 2020, Carter moved past Alex English for 19th on the NBA all-time scoring list. On January 31, 2020, Carter moved up to 3rd place in all-time NBA games played with 1,523 passing Dirk Nowitzki in the process. On March 11, 2020, Carter returned to the floor in the final seconds of a game against the New York Knicks, making a three-pointer. That game became Carter&#x27;s final game; the NBA suspended the season that day due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Carter officially announced his retirement from the NBA on June 25, 2020, at the age of 43.

==National team career==
Carter played for head coach Kelvin Sampson on the United States men&#x27;s national under-19 team at the 1995 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup in Athens. He and Samaki Walker tied for the team lead in blocks in the team&#x27;s eight games.

During the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Carter led the U.S. in scoring averaging 14.8 points a game. He also performed one of the most memorable dunks of his career when he jumped over French center Frédéric Weis. Teammate Jason Kidd said &quot;It was one of the best plays I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; The French media later dubbed it &quot;le dunk de la mort&quot; (&quot;the Dunk of Death&quot;). The U.S. team went on to win the gold medal that year. Carter admitted he channeled his frustrations in his personal life and Tracy McGrady leaving the Raptors before the Olympics. The dunk is widely considered one of the greatest and most famous of all time.

Carter replaced Kobe Bryant on the USA roster for the 2003 FIBA Americas Tournament while Bryant was undergoing surgeries on his knee and shoulder. He wore Bryant&#x27;s jersey number 8. Bryant was supposed to take his spot back in time for the 2004 Olympics, but would later withdraw due to allegations of sexual assault. Carter was offered the Olympic spot but chose instead to take time off during the summer to rest and heal, as well as to get married.

Nike released five other signature Shox models bearing Carter&#x27;s initials. During his final season, Nike commemorated Carter&#x27;s 22 year NBA career by publicly re-releasing his first Nike signature shoe, the Shox BB4.

On September 17, 2020, ESPN announced that Carter had signed a multi-year contract with them, serving as an NBA and college basketball analyst.

<text>Nuclear propulsion includes a wide variety of propulsion methods that use some form of nuclear reaction as their primary power source. The idea of using nuclear material for propulsion dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 it was hypothesized that radioactive material, radium, might be a suitable fuel for engines to propel cars, planes, and boats. H. G. Wells picked up this idea in his 1914 fiction work &quot;The World Set Free&quot;. Many aircraft carriers and submarines currently use uranium fueled nuclear reactors that can provide propulsion for long periods without refueling. There are also applications in the space sector with nuclear thermal and nuclear electric engines which could be more efficient than conventional rocket engines. 
==Surface ships, submarines, and torpedoes==

Nuclear-powered vessels are mainly military submarines, and aircraft carriers. Russia is the only country that currently has nuclear-powered civilian surface ships, mainly icebreakers. The US Navy currently (as of 2022) has 11 aircraft carriers and 70 submarines in service, that are all powered by nuclear reactors. For more detailed articles see:

===Civilian maritime use===

===Military maritime use===

* List of United States Naval reactors
* Soviet naval reactors
* Nuclear submarine

===Torpedo===

Russia&#x27;s Channel One Television news broadcast a picture and details of a nuclear-powered torpedo called &quot;Status-6&quot; on about 12 November 2015. The torpedo was stated as having a range of up to 10,000 km, a cruising speed of 100 knots, and an operational depth of up to 1000 metres below the surface. The torpedo carried a 100-megaton nuclear warhead.

One of the suggestions emerging in the summer of 1958 from the first meeting of the scientific advisory group that became JASON was for &quot;a nuclear-powered torpedo that could roam the seas almost indefinitely&quot;.

==Aircraft and missiles==

Research into nuclear-powered aircraft was pursued during the Cold War by the United States and the Soviet Union as they would presumably allow a country to keep nuclear bombers in the air for extremely long periods of time, a useful tactic for nuclear deterrence. Neither country created any operational nuclear aircraft. One design problem, never adequately solved, was the need for heavy shielding to protect the crew from radiation sickness. Since the advent of ICBMs in the 1960s the tactical advantage of such aircraft was greatly diminished and respective projects were cancelled. Because the technology was inherently dangerous it was not considered in non-military contexts. Nuclear-powered missiles were also researched and discounted during the same period.
===Aircraft===
* Convair X-6
* Myasishchev M-50 - &quot;Aviation Week&quot; hoax
* Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion - General Electric&#x27;s project to build a nuclear-powered bomber
* Tupolev Tu-95LAL
===Missiles===
* Project Pluto - which developed the SLAM missile, that used a nuclear-powered air ramjet for propulsion
* Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile announced by Vladimir Putin in 2018.

==Spacecraft==

Many types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them (e.g., NERVA) tested for spacecraft applications.

===Nuclear pulse propulsion===

*Project Orion, first engineering design study of nuclear pulse (i.e., atomic explosion) propulsion
*Project Daedalus, 1970s British Interplanetary Society study of a fusion rocket
*Project Longshot, US Naval Academy-NASA nuclear pulse propulsion design
*AIMStar, a proposed Antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion craft that uses clouds of antiprotons to initiate fission and fusion within fuel pellets
*ICAN-II, a proposed crewed interplanetary spacecraft that used the antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion engine as its main form of propulsion
*External Pulsed Plasma Propulsion (EPPP), a propulsion concept by NASA that derives its thrust from plasma waves generated from a series of small, supercritical fission/fusion pulses behind an object in space.

=== Nuclear thermal rocket ===
Bimodal nuclear thermal rockets conduct nuclear fission reactions similar to those employed at nuclear power plants including submarines. The energy is used to heat the liquid hydrogen propellant. Advocates of nuclear-powered spacecraft point out that at the time of launch, there is almost no radiation released from the nuclear reactors. Nuclear-powered rockets are not used to lift off the Earth. Nuclear thermal rockets can provide great performance advantages compared to chemical propulsion systems. Nuclear power sources could also be used to provide the spacecraft with electrical power for operations and scientific instrumentation.
Examples:
*NERVA (Nuclear Energy for Rocket Vehicle Applications), a US nuclear thermal rocket program
*Project Rover, an American project to develop a nuclear thermal rocket. The program ran at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory from 1955 through 1972.
*Project Timberwind (1987–1991), part of the Strategic Defense Initiative
*RD-0410, a Soviet nuclear thermal rocket engine developed from 1965 through the 1980s
*Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO), under development in the 2020s

===Ramjet===
*Bussard ramjet, a conceptual interstellar fusion ramjet named after Robert W. Bussard.

===Direct nuclear===
*Fission fragment rocket
*Fission sail
*Fusion rocket
*Gas core reactor rocket
*Nuclear salt-water rocket
*Radioisotope rocket
*Nuclear photonic rocket

===Nuclear electric===
*Nuclear electric rocket
*Project Prometheus, NASA development of nuclear propulsion for long-duration spaceflight, begun in 2003

===Russian Federal Space Agency development===

Anatolij Perminov, head of the Russian Federal Space Agency, announced that it is going to develop a nuclear-powered spacecraft for deep space travel. Preliminary design was done by 2013, and 9 more years are planned for development (in space assembly). The price is set at 17 billion rubles (600 million dollars).
The nuclear propulsion would have mega-watt class, provided necessary funding, Roscosmos Head stated.

This system would consist of a space nuclear power and a matrix of ion engines. &quot;...Hot inert gas temperature of 1500 °C from the reactor turns turbines. The turbine turns the generator and compressor, which circulates the working fluid in a closed circuit. The working fluid is cooled in the radiator. The generator produces electricity for the same ion (plasma) engine...&quot;

According to him, the propulsion will be able to support human mission to Mars, with cosmonauts staying on the Red planet for 30 days. This journey to Mars with nuclear propulsion and a steady acceleration would take six weeks, instead of eight months by using chemical propulsion – assuming thrust of 300 times higher than that of chemical propulsion.

==Ground vehicles==

===Cars===
The idea of making cars that used radioactive material, radium, for fuel dates back to at least 1903. Analysis of the concept in 1937 indicated that the driver of such a vehicle might need a 50-ton lead barrier to shield them from radiation.

In 1941, a Caltech physicist named R. M. Langer espoused the idea of a car powered by uranium-235 in the January edition of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;. He was followed by William Bushnell Stout, designer of the Stout Scarab and former Society of Engineers president, on 7 August 1945 in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The problem of shielding the reactor continued to render the idea impractical. In December 1945, a John Wilson of London, announced he had created an atomic car. This created considerable interest. The Minister of Fuel and Power along with a large press contingent turned out to view it. The car did not show and Wilson claimed that it had been sabotaged. A later court case found that he was a fraud and there was no nuclear-powered car.

Despite the shielding problem, through the late 1940s and early 1950s debate continued around the possibility of nuclear-powered cars. The development of nuclear-powered submarines and ships, and experiments to develop a nuclear-powered aircraft at that time kept the idea alive. Russian papers in the mid-1950s reported the development of a nuclear-powered car by Professor V P Romadin, but again shielding proved to be a problem. It was claimed that its laboratories had overcome the shielding problem with a new alloy that absorbed the rays.

In 1958, at the height of the 1950s American automobile culture there were at least four theoretical nuclear-powered concept cars proposed, the American Ford Nucleon and Studebaker Packard Astral, as well as the French Simca Fulgur designed by Robert Opron and the Arbel Symétric. Apart from these concept models, none were built and no automotive nuclear power plants ever made. Chrysler engineer C R Lewis had discounted the idea in 1957 because of estimates that an engine would be required by a car. His view was that an efficient means of storing energy was required for nuclear power to be practical. Despite this, Chrysler&#x27;s stylists in 1958 drew up some possible designs.

In 1959 it was reported that Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company had developed a new rubber compound that was light and absorbed radiation, obviating the need for heavy shielding. A reporter at the time considered it might make nuclear-powered cars and aircraft a possibility.

Ford made another potentially nuclear-powered model in 1962 for the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair, the Ford Seattle-ite XXI. This also never went beyond the initial concept.

In 2009, for the hundredth anniversary of General Motors&#x27; acquisition of Cadillac, Loren Kulesus created concept art depicting a car powered by thorium.

===Other===
The Chrysler TV-8 was an experimental concept tank designed by Chrysler in the 1950s. The tank was intended to be a nuclear-powered medium tank capable of land and amphibious warfare. The design was never mass-produced.

The X-12 was a nuclear powered locomotive, proposed in a feasibility study done in 1954 at the University of Utah.

The Mars rovers &quot;Curiosity&quot; and &quot;Perseverance&quot; are powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), like the successful Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars landers in 1976.

<doc id="496577" wikidata="Q1498406" url="?curid=496577" title=".hack//Legend of the Twilight">
<text>is a science fiction manga series written by Tatsuya Hamazaki and drawn by Rei Izumi. The twenty-two chapters of &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot; appeared as a serial in the Japanese magazine &quot;Comptiq&quot; and published in three by Kadokawa Shoten from July 2002 to April 2004. Set in a fictional MMORPG, &quot;The World&quot;, the series focuses on twins Rena and Shugo, who receive chibi avatars in the design of the legendary .hackers known as Kite and BlackRose. After Shugo is given the Twilight Bracelet by a mysterious girl, the two embark on a quest to find Aura and unravel the mystery of the Twilight Bracelet.

The series was adapted into a twelve episode anime of the same name directed by Koichi Mashimo and Koji Sawai and produced by Bee Train.

Tokyopop licensed the manga series for an English-language release in North America. It published the three volumes from September 2003 to April 2004. Bandai Entertainment had licensed the anime series for North American broadcast. The word &quot;Bracelet&quot; in the title was removed in North America, shortening the title to &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot;. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment, Funimation announced at SDCC 2013, that they have acquired 4 .hack titles including Legend of the Twilight.

==Plot==

Set in a fictional MMORPG called &quot;The World&quot;, the series follows twins Shugo and Rena. After winning a contest, Rena is given a pair of chibi avatars in the design of the legendary .hackers, Kite and BlackRose. After an odd occurrence, a mysterious AI named Aura gives Shugo the Twilight Bracelet, an item that both aids and hinders him. Rena and Shugo embark on an adventure to find Aura and unravel the mystery of the Twilight Bracelet.

Along the way, Shugo and Rena befriend Mireille, a rare item hunter; the fierce Ouka; and Hotaru, a peaceful girl. While waiting for an event to start, they encounter a strange girl named Zefie, who is lured to Shugo because she believes the bracelet smells like her mother, Aura. It is later realized that Zefie is a vagrant AI – an AI that acts independently outside the parameters of the game. Zefie&#x27;s presence upsets many, including the Cobalt Knights, a group of administrators that follow the rule &quot;If you can&#x27;t control it, delete it&quot; to an extreme.

Meanwhile, Balmung, another administrator in &quot;The World,&quot; encounters problems of his own. The suits, CC Corp&#x27;s upper tier executives, are displeased with what little action Balmung has taken against Shugo and his illegal item, the Twilight Bracelet. Balmung&#x27;s administrative duties are revoked.

Kamui, the leader of the Cobalt Knights, begins her pursuit of Shugo and company. She captures Shugo and his friends, but allows Mireille, Ouka, and Hotaru to leave after they promise they will not interfere with the workings of &quot;The World.&quot; Shugo, Rena, and Zefie are left in a cell together. Rena and Shugo disagree over whether to stay until the end. After they come to an agreement to stay and fight, Zefie opens the door to the cell, freeing them.

In the outside world, Ouka, Hotaru, and Mireille decide to return to &quot;The World&quot; and help Shugo. Kazu, a friend of Balmung, meets up with Shugo and party, carrying &quot;Helba&#x27;s Key,&quot; the key to an area called the Net Slums. Kamui shows up, demanding the key to the Net Slums with her knights in tow. Shugo and Kamui face off, which results in Kamui breaking her axe. Zefie tells her that everyone in &quot;The World&quot; is blessed. Shugo activates Helba&#x27;s key and transports himself, Rena, Mireille, Hotaru, and Zefie to the Net Slums. Once at the Net Slums, the party is confronted by Balmung, refuses to allow the party to proceed to Aura unless Shugo can damage him. Shugo struggles, but manages to strike Balmung. Pleased, Balmung hands Shugo the virus cores he&#x27;ll need to see Aura; he also explains that only three people can go see Aura. Hotaru and Mireille say their goodbyes to Zefie, Shugo, and Rena as they activate the virus cores and meet Aura. The manga ends with Zefie being reunited with her mother, and Shugo telling Aura of his adventures in &quot;The World&quot;.

===Anime===
The anime has many differences from the manga, though the story begins in much the same way. Rena wins a limited edition character model contest for &quot;The World&quot; and invites her twin brother Shugo to play the legendary character Kite while she plays as the legendary BlackRose. On their first outing together, Shugo is killed by a monster, but is revived by a mysterious girl named Aura. As well as reviving Shugo, Aura gives him a mysterious bracelet. Shugo and Rena continue to play &quot;The World&quot; and find many warped monsters. They eventually meet new friends, Mireille, Ouka, Hotaru and Sanjuro. However, while searching through a haunted mansion, Rena disappears and falls into a coma. Shugo and Rena&#x27;s friends frantically search for a solution, while a group of children plan something terrible. The Cerulean Knights, a debugging team for CC Corp, hinder the situation by trying to capture Shugo because of his bracelet. When Shugo and company reach a mysterious place where Rena might be, they are met by a hostile AI named Morti. Using the bracelet and a little help from an inside ally, the group locates the source of the problem and proceed to stop it. They transport themselves to a root town that is not open to the public yet, where Shugo manages to defeat the AI; however, due to some of the programming of the AI, &quot;The World&quot; will be destroyed. Shugo and Rena then activate Kite and Blackrose&#x27;s joint power to save &quot;The World.&quot;

Rei Izumi describes &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot; as &quot;the story of the future&quot; and &quot;the first to usher in the &quot;.hack&quot; franchise and the last to end.&quot; The series took Izumi and Tatsuya Hamazaki three and a half years to complete; &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight &quot; was originally planned to be two volumes long, but a decision was made to extend the series. As a result, the original story was rewritten. Additionally, the scene with Kamui and Zefie was extended. Kamui was originally male, her axe was not broken, and her role ended after she tossed away Grunty. Despite this, Izumi wanted to include more of Kamui and Balmung in the series.

Izumi and Hamazaki created Reki, Balmung&#x27;s assistant, and Magi, Kamui&#x27;s assistant, as they were deciding on character names; the two were not in the original draft of &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot;. Reki was invented because Izumi and Hamazaki needed a character for Balmung to communicate with. Izumi suggested Reki and Tatsuya offered Magi for the names of the two assistants.

==Reception==
&quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot; was positively received by English-language readers. The first volume ranked first on Bookscan for graphic novels and 40th on the &quot;adult fiction trade paperback list&quot;. The third volume placed ninth in Bookscan&#x27;s list of the top ten best-selling graphic novel. The one-volume re-release ranked 164th on the list of the 300 best-selling graphic novels with an estimated 544 copies sold for December 2009.

It received lukewarm reviews from critics for its &quot;child-oriented&quot; and &quot;generic&quot; art, and being more light-hearted than &quot;.hack//SIGN&quot;, and oriented towards a younger audience. Another reviewer labelled it as one of the worst manga that he had ever read for its confusing and cliché storytelling.

Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Reviews found &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot; to be &quot;inferior&quot; to the other &quot;.hack&quot; series. He criticized the &quot;creepy subtext&quot; between Shugo and Rena, calling them &quot;clingier and more over-affectionate than any real life siblings should be&quot;.

<doc id="496583" wikidata="Q258935" url="?curid=496583" title="David Bushnell">
<text>David Bushnell (August 30, 1740 – 1824 or 1826), of Westbrook, Connecticut, was an American inventor, a patriot, a teacher, and a medical doctor.

Bushnell invented the first submarine to be used in battle, &quot;Turtle&quot;, as well as a floating mine triggered by contact. He was a veteran of the Revolutionary War.

==Early life==
David Bushnell was born in a secluded part of Saybrook, Connecticut on 30 August 1740 and baptized in 1753 into a farming family in what is now Westbrook, Connecticut where his parents Nehemiah Bushnell and Sarah (Susan) Ingham Bushnell owned a farm. He was the first of five children born. Following the death of his father circa 1769, he sold his half interest in the family Westbrook farm to his brother Ezra and entered Yale College in 1771 at the relatively old age of 31.

==The &quot;Turtle&quot; submarine==
Bushnell is credited with creating the first submarine ever used in combat, while studying at Yale in 1775. He called it &quot;Turtle&quot; because of its look in the water. His idea of using water as ballast for submerging and raising his submarine is still in use, as is the screw propeller, which was used in &quot;Turtle.&quot;

While at Yale, Bushnell proved that gunpowder could be exploded under water. He used this knowledge not only in construction of the underwater mine but later in creating floating torpedoes that exploded on contact. Working with the wealthy New Haven inventor, clock-maker, and brass foundry-man Isaac Doolittle, he also co-developed the first mechanically triggered time bomb as well as one of the first ship&#x27;s propeller. He combined these ideas by building &quot;Turtle&quot; which was designed to attack ships by attaching a time bomb to their hulls, while using a hand powered drill and ship auger bit to penetrate the hulls.

On September 7, 1776, &quot;Turtle&quot;, manned by Sergeant Ezra Lee of the Continental Army, was used to attack the British 64-gun ship of the line which was moored in New York Harbor. However, &quot;Turtle&quot;″s attack failed.

&quot;Turtle&quot; was lost while being transported aboard a sloop; the sloop was discovered and sunk by British frigates leaving Bloomingdale.

==Attack on HMS &quot;Cerberus&quot;==
Realizing that &quot;Turtle&quot; was impractical as a weapon, Bushnell turned explosive devices that he called torpedoes first used as a name for electric rays (in the order &quot;Torpediniformes&quot;), which in turn comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot; (&quot;lethargy&quot; or &quot;sluggishness&quot;). In 1777 Bushnell attempted to use a floating mine to blow up in Niantic Bay; the mine struck a small boat near &quot;Cerberus&quot; and detonated killing four sailors and destroying the vessel, but not the intended target. In 1778 he launched what became lauded as the Battle of the Kegs, in which a series of mines was floated down the Delaware River to attack British ships anchored there, killing two curious young boys and alerting the British. The attack was ineffectual.

==Continental Army service==
In 1778, General Washington proposed the formation of a new military unit to be known as the &quot;Corps of Sappers and Miners&quot; (i.e. combat engineers) and in the summer of the next year it was organized. Bushnell was given command of the Corps with the rank of captain-lieutenant on August 2, 1779. On May 6, 1779, he was taken prisoner in Middlesex Parish, now Darien, Connecticut, and was later exchanged.

On June 8, 1781, Bushnell was commissioned as a captain in the Continental Army and was at the Siege of Yorktown in September and October of that year. This was the only time the Sappers and Miners had had the opportunity to serve in combat.

Bushnell served in the Army until he was discharged on June 3, 1783. He then became an original member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati, an organization formed by officers who were veterans of the Continental Army and Navy.

At some point after the Revolution, Bushnell was presented a medal by George Washington.

==Later life==
After peace was declared he returned to Connecticut where he lived until 1787 when he abruptly moved to France. His activities in France are unknown, although it has been speculated that he may have collaborated with inventor Robert Fulton in developing a design for a submarine.

In 1803 Bushnell settled in Warrenton, Georgia under the pseudonym of David Bush. He taught at the Warrenton Academy and practiced medicine. He died in Warrenton in 1824.

==Legacy==
A full sized model of David Bushnell&#x27;s &quot;Turtle&quot; is on display at the U.S. Navy Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut.

In 1915, the U.S. Navy named the submarine tender after him and it was launched in Bremerton, Washington. &quot;Bushnell&quot; served during World War I and was renamed USS &quot;Sumner&quot; in 1940 and was present during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. She was employed as a survey ship during World War II and was decommissioned in 1946.

On 14 September 1942, another submarine tender of the same name was launched. &quot;Bushnell&quot; served during World War II and later was the flagship of Submarine Squadron 12 in Key West, Florida from 1952 until she was decommissioned in 1970.

In 2004 the Georgia House of Representatives passed a resolution declaring August 30, 2004 as David Bushnell Day in Georgia.

<text>The Battle of Freiburg, fought over three days on 3, 5, and 9 August 1644, took place during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, near Freiburg im Breisgau, now in Baden-Württemberg. A French army of 16,000, led jointly by Condé and Turenne, sought to relieve the town, which had recently surrendered to a Bavarian force under Franz von Mercy. In what has been described as the bloodiest battle of the war, around half of the French soldiers engaged were killed or wounded, with the Bavarians losing up to a third of theirs. The French claimed victory since Mercy was forced to withdraw, but the result is disputed.

Having captured Freiburg on 28 July, Mercy placed his men in strong defensive positions on the hills outside the town, which the French attacked on 3 and 5 August. Although the assaults made little progress and incurred severe losses, the Bavarians also suffered heavy casualties and were short of supplies. On 9 August, Mercy learned a detachment under Turenne was marching into his rear to cut off his supply lines, and ordered a general retreat, leaving a garrison in Freiburg. Apart from a brief skirmish with Turenne&#x27;s cavalry next day, they withdrew in good order, despite abandoning their baggage train and several guns. 

Nevertheless, Freiburg convinced Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, that the war could not be won and he began negotiating peace terms. Mercy was ordered to suspend offensive operations, ceding France the strategic initiative, and allowing Condé and Turenne to take control of most of the northern Upper Rhine.

==Background==
A decisive Swedish victory at Breitenfeld in November 1642 secured control of Northern Germany, while in 1643 their French allies took the offensive in the Rhineland. On 18 November 1643, a French army captured Rottweil, which they intended to use as a winter base, but their commander Guébriant, was mortally wounded during the siege. On 24 November, his successor Josias von Rantzau was ambushed at Tuttlingen by a Bavarian-Imperial army under Franz von Mercy and Johann von Werth. Taken by surprise, the French force of 16,000 effectively disintegrated, with more than two thirds killed, wounded, or captured either during the battle, or afterwards as they retreated into Alsace.
Rantzau was among the prisoners and he was replaced by Turenne, who took urgent steps to rebuild his shattered army. The French position was further weakened when Sweden initiated the Torstenson War with Denmark-Norway in December 1643, diverting resources and attention away from Germany. Over the winter of 1643/1644, Mercy used the opportunity to seize control of large areas along the Upper Rhine, Swabia and the Breisgau. 

For the 1644 summer campaign, Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, decided to capitalise by forcing Turenne out of his bases on the Rhine. To achieve this, on 11 May Mercy first secured his rear by capturing Überlingen on Lake Constance, then advanced on the French-held town of Freiburg. After some skirmishing with Turenne in the Black Forest, he arrived outside Freiburg on 16 June, and began siege operations.

Turenne, who had withdrawn to Breisach, was ordered to relieve Freiburg, which he reached on 1 July with around 8,000 men. By this time, the Bavarians had established strong positions in the mountains at Schönberg and Lorettoberg, as well as a series of redoubts along the plain in front of the town. When his initial assault was repulsed, Turenne broke off the attack and demanded reinforcements from Cardinal Mazarin. On 2 August, 9,000 men arrived in Breisach from Flanders, led by Condé, although Freiburg itself had surrendered on 28 July. As he was senior to Turenne, Condé assumed overall command, and decided to attack the following day.

==Battle; 3 and 5 August==
There were lengthy debates over the French plan of attack, which were later recorded by several of those present. It was ultimately agreed Condé would assault Mercy&#x27;s defences on the Schönberg which blocked the main road into Freiburg, while Turenne made a flanking march via Wittnau against the village of Merzhausen in their rear (&quot;see Battle map right&quot;). To ensure both happened simultaneously, Condé delayed his operations until 17:00 to give Turenne time to move into position. 

Despite the difficult ground over which he had to manoeuvre, Turenne began his attack as planned. However, he was driven back by Mercy&#x27;s reserves of infantry and supporting cuirassiers, and unable to make progress against determined resistance. Meanwhile, ignoring the protests of his subordinates, Condé personally led the assault on the Schönberg. His men took the positions after several hours of fighting, but suffered heavy casualties doing so, while it was now too dark to follow up their success. Although Turenne had finally resumed his advance, many of his men were still coming up, slowed by heavy rain, and at midnight the two commanders agreed to halt operations. 

Mercy used this pause to withdraw his troops to new positions at the Lorettoberg. Driving the Imperial-Bavarian forces off the Schönberg allowed Condé and Turenne to reunite their troops at Merzhausen, five kilometres outside Freiburg. However, they still faced a series of formidable defensive entrenchments, while persistent rain meant no fighting was possible on 4 August. 

Deciding the only other choice was to retreat, on 5 August the French commanders opted for frontal assaults against entrenchments along the Lorettoberg and at Wiehre. These degenerated into a series of bloody and poorly co-ordinated firefights, which continued for most of the day. When night came, Mercy had held his ground, but two days of fighting had reduced his force by a third, with the French having lost half the number of men engaged.

==Battle; 9 August==
The French spent the next three days evacuating their wounded to Breisach, and gathering 5,000 replacements from local garrisons for their next attack. While Condé remained in Merzhausen to occupy Mercy, early on 9 August Turenne took 6,000 men and began marching into his rear at Denzlingen, five kilometres north of Freiburg. Since this would cut off the escape route to Villingen, the French commanders hoped Mercy would be forced to fight, or make a hurried flight. 

However, Mercy had already decided to withdraw. Two days of battle had reduced his strength to around 6,000 men, who were short of both ammunition and food. The problem was especially acute for his cavalry, essential for covering the retreat but whose combat effectiveness was quickly declining due to lack of forage for their horses. Leaving a hand-picked garrison to hold Freiburg, on 9 August the rest of his army began falling back on St. Peter, which controlled the road to Villingen. On the morning of 10 August, Turenne&#x27;s cavalry caught up with the Bavarian rearguard just outside the village, forcing them to abandon several guns and some baggage. Despite this, Mercy reached Rottenburg am Neckar on 15 August without incident.

Total casualties for the three days of battle were enormous on both sides. Périni suggests French losses were around 50%, or 8,000, those of the Bavarians about a third, or 3,000. Other estimates range from 5,000 to 8,000 for the French, and 2,500 to 6,800 for the Bavarians. At the time, the French claimed victory because Mercy&#x27;s retreat left them in possession of the battlefield, a view supported by a number of historians. Others suggest it can also be seen as a draw, or a Bavarian tactical victory, as they fought off the French assaults and inflicted heavy casualties.

==Aftermath==
Mercy still controlled most of Swabia, but his losses led Maximilian to ban any further offensive action, while his retreat to Rottenburg left the Upper Rhine exposed. Turenne convinced Condé not to waste the rest of the summer retaking Freiburg, but instead march north to capture Philippsburg, which surrendered on 12 September. After this, the French went on to occupy Worms, Oppenheim, Mainz, and Landau, leaving them in control of the Rhine valley.

Maximilian was now convinced the war could no longer be won, and put pressure on Emperor Ferdinand to restart peace negotiations. These began in November 1644, although fighting continued as both sides tried to improve their negotiating position. Much of the veteran Bavarian cavalry was lost at Jankau in March 1645, while in May Mercy destroyed a French detachment at Herbsthausen. He in turn was defeated and killed at Second Nördlingen in August, depriving Maximilian of his most effective military commander.

<text>The St. Croix River (; Maliseet-Passamaquoddy: &quot;Skutik&quot;) is a river in northeastern North America, in length, that forms part of the Canada–United States border between Maine (U.S.) and New Brunswick (Canada). The river rises in the Chiputneticook Lakes and flows south and southeast, between Calais and St. Stephen. It discharges into Passamaquoddy Bay, in the Bay of Fundy.

==Geography==
The river forms from the Chiputneticook Lakes (North Lake, East Grand Lake, Mud Lake, and Spednic Lake) along the Canadian–U.S. border. U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps show the St. Croix River as beginning at the outlet stream from East Grand Lake, then flowing through the short Mud Lake and entering Spednic Lake, extending to its outlet at Vanceboro, Maine, and the start of the river proper. Adding the section of river and lake from the outlet of East Grand Lake gives a total length of to the St. Croix.

The total drainage area of the river is approximately . In the 20th century, the river was heavily developed for hydroelectric power. The river had previously hosted a large population of Atlantic salmon; however, the salmon population was reduced after building hydroelectric dams upriver from Calais-St. Stephen.

The river is an estuary between Calais-St. Stephen and the river&#x27;s mouth at Robbinston and St. Andrews. This tidal area extends for approximately along this section and exhibits a tidal bore.

===Navigation===
The Saint Croix River was an early trade corridor to interior Maine and New Brunswick from the Atlantic coast. Ocean ships could navigate upstream to Calais and St. Stephen; although tidal fluctuation made Eastport a preferred port for deeper draft vessels. The river upstream of Calais and St. Stephen became an important transportation corridor for log driving to bring wooden logs and pulpwood from interior forests to sawmills and paper mills built to use water power at Calais and Woodland.

==Historical boundary issues==
The boundary issues of the St. Croix River came out of the Treaty of Paris that was signed in 1783. The geography of the river was not charted clearly until the Jay Treaty (1794) provided provisions for surveying the boundary. The boundary between Maine and New Brunswick north of the headwaters of the Saint Croix took another four decades to establish. Following the War of 1812 there was a push to settle this disputed territory north of the St. Croix on the St. John watershed and it remained in dispute until 1842. During this conflict Maine, Massachusetts and New Brunswick continued to issue some lumbering permits to the disputed territory. With or without a permit, lumbermen were in a race to cut the best timber from the land while it was under dispute. Although it was illegal to cut trees with no permit, the Saint John River enabled this activity because it increased business at the local mills, shipyards and timber ponds in New Brunswick so the officials were slow to halt the ongoing illegal activity.

During this time, the lumbermen were very serious and competitive about the trees. Whoever got to the best trees first claimed them. Dynamite was used as a tool of sabotage to blow up some of the log booms that were strung across the river to catch the recently cut trees. It is also known that at times the timber men purposely sorted their logs incorrectly to attempt to confuse local officials charged with regulating timber trade and transportation.

Prior to 2001, it was possible for boaters to use campsites on both sides of the river. However, boaters must now stay on the same shore that they entered from, and report their trip to the appropriate border agency.

==Water level monitoring==

===Canada===
The Water Survey of Canada maintains six river flow gauges in the St. Croix River watershed:

* St. Croix, New Brunswick ()
* Baring, Maine ()
* Dennis Stream near St. Stephen, New Brunswick ()
* East Grand Lake at Forest City, New Brunswick ()
* Spednic Lake at St. Croix, New Brunswick ()
* Forest City Stream, below the Forest City Dam at Forest City, New Brunswick ()

===United States===
The United States Geological Survey maintains two river flow gauges in the St. Croix River watershed.

* Vanceboro, Maine () where the rivershed is , downstream from the Spednik Lake Dam.
* Baring Plantation, Maine () where the rivershed is , downstream of the nearest dam. The maximum recorded flow here is per second and the minimum per second.

USGS also maintains a water chemistry monitor at Milltown, Maine () where the rivershed is . For water year 2001, the pH ranged from 6.6 to 7.2.

==Crossings==

Seven active international bridges cross the river at the following locations:

* St. Croix, New Brunswick-Vanceboro, Maine (Saint Croix–Vanceboro Bridge, road
* St. Croix-Vanceboro (Saint Croix–Vanceboro Railway Bridge), rail
* Mohannes, New Brunswick-Woodland, Maine (unnamed Maine Central Railroad bridge), rail
* Upper Mills, New Brunswick-Baring, Maine (unnamed Maine Central Railroad bridge), rail
* St. Stephen, New Brunswick-Calais, Maine, International Avenue Bridge, road
* St. Stephen, New Brunswick-Calais, Maine (Milltown International Bridge), road
* St. Stephen, New Brunswick-Calais, Maine (unnamed New Brunswick Southern Railway/Maine Central Railroad bridge), rail
* St. Stephen, New Brunswick-Calais, Maine (St. Stephen-Calais Bridge), road

One defunct crossing exists:
* St. Stephen, New Brunswick-Calais, Maine, ferry (at site of St. Stephen-Calais Bridge)

==Derived names==
HMCS &quot;St. Croix&quot; (I81), previously USS &quot;McCook&quot; (DD-252), became a Canadian ship in 1940 as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. It was renamed after the St. Croix River to follow the Canadian tradition of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers while recognizing the shared national history of the ship.

==Dam removal==

New Brunswick Power has indicated their desire to remove the 138 year old Milltown Dam on the St Croix River between St. Stephen, New Brunswick (Canada), and Calais, Maine (USA). Currently, New Brunswick Power stakeholders, government officials, the Peskotomuhkati Tribe, locals, and the public are examining this proposed dam removal. Milltown Dam removal would restore Salmon Falls between St. Stephen and Calais. The Peskotomuhkati Tribe is also advocating for the removal of Milltown Dam and the full restoration of Salmon Falls. Milltown Dam was built in 1881 by New Brunswick Power and is the oldest operating hydro facility in Canada. Atlantic Salmon, shad, eels, and alewives would all benefit from this dam&#x27;s removal and ongoing habitat restoration. St Croix River oxygen levels would also improve with the restoration of Salmon Falls.

<doc id="496599" wikidata="Q5525" url="?curid=496599" title="Great Bear Lake">
<text>Great Bear Lake (; ) is a lake in the boreal forest of Canada. It is the largest lake entirely in Canada (Lake Superior and Lake Huron are larger but straddle the Canada–US border), the fourth-largest in North America, and the eighth-largest in the world. The lake is in the Northwest Territories, on the Arctic Circle between 65 and 67 degrees of northern latitude and between 118 and 123 degrees western longitude, above sea level.

The name originated from the Chipewyan word , meaning &quot;grizzly bear-water people&quot;. The Sahtu, a Dene people, are named after the lake. Grizzly Bear Mountain, or &quot;Sahoyue&quot;, on the shore of the lake also comes from Chipewyan, meaning &quot;bear-large hill&quot;.

Sahoyue (Grizzly Bear Mountain), a peninsula on the south side of the lake, and Edacho (Scented Grass Hills), another peninsula on the west side, form the Saoyú-ʔehdacho National Historic Site of Canada.

==Geography==
The lake has a surface area of and a volume of . Its maximum depth is and average depth . The shoreline is and the catchment area of the lake is . Great Bear Lake is covered with ice from late November to July.

The lake is known for its considerable clarity. Explorer John Franklin wrote in 1828 that a white rag placed in the water did not disappear until it exceeded a depth of .

=== Arms ===
Arms of Great Bear Lake include the Smith Arm (northwest), the Dease Arm (northeast), the McTavish Arm (southeast), the McVicar Arm (south) and the Keith Arm (southwest). The community of Délı̨nę is located on the Keith Arm near the outflow of the Great Bear River that flows west into the Mackenzie River at Tulita.

=== Tributaries ===
Rivers flowing into Great Bear Lake include the Whitefish River, Big Spruce River, Haldane River, Bloody River, Sloan River, Dease River and the Johnny Hoe River.

==Geology and geomorphology ==
Great Bear Lake lies between two major physiographic regions: the Kazan Uplands portion of the Canadian Shield and the Interior Plains. It was part of glacial Lake McConnell in the pre-glacial valleys reshaped by ice erosion during the Pleistocene. Since, the lake has changed from post-glacial rebound following the ice melting. Precambrian rocks of the Canadian Shield form the eastern margin of the McTavish Arm. These rocks of the Precambrian are sedimentary and metamorphic deposits supplemented by igneous intrusions forming dikes and sills.

==Climate==


==Human use==

The community of Délı̨nę is on the lake, near the headwaters of the Bear River. There is an ice crossing from Délı̨nę to the winter road on the far side of the Great Bear River.

On 5 March 2016, a tank truck fell partway through the ice road just a few days after the government had increased the allowed maximum weight limit to on the road. The truck, which was outside of Délı̨nę and close to the community&#x27;s fresh water intake, as well as a major fishing area, contained approximately of heating fuel and was one of 70 truck loads intended to resupply the community. The fuel was removed from the truck by 2 am, 8 March.

Three lodges around the lake are destinations for fishing and hunting. In 1995, a lake trout was caught, the largest ever caught anywhere by angling.

=== Mining ===
In 1930, Gilbert LaBine discovered uranium deposits in the Great Bear Lake region. The former mining area Port Radium, site of the Eldorado Mine, where pitchblende was discovered, was located on the eastern shore. Echo Bay Mines Limited leased the old camp and mill at Port Radium to recover silver and copper values from 1965 to 1981.

==Cultural significance==
===The Prophecy===
Great Bear Lake is paramount in the Délı̨nę peoples&#x27; identity, laws and culture. Hence, conserving it is critical for the Délı̨nę people. ɂehtsǝ́o Erǝ́ya, a Dene Elder, is widely regarded as a prophet, making over 30 prophecies which have been interpreted as having come true. His prediction for the end of times claims that, as the world dries up, the little remaining life will flock to, and end on the banks of the Great Bear Lake, a lake seen as a physical beating heart to humanity. The Délı̨nę people have followed these prophecies closely, the cultural considerations being a driving force for self-governance and environmental sustainability.

<doc id="496602" wikidata="Q2946304" url="?curid=496602" title="Century City (TV series)">
<text>Century City is an American science fiction legal drama television series created by Ed Zuckerman, that aired on CBS from March 16, 2004, to January 20, 2005, before being cancelled due to low ratings. The series is set in Los Angeles in the year 2030.

==Synopsis==
The show follows the legal team of Crane, Constable, McNeil &amp; Montero. At the helm are the firm&#x27;s four partners, the founder and senior partner Hannah Crane; veteran attorney Marty Constable; the pleased-with-himself attorney Darwin McNeil; and the former Californian Congressman and newest partner, Tom Montero. The team is supplemented by the ambitious enthusiasm of two young associates, the self-critical and earnest Lukas Gold and the genetically enhanced first-year associate Lee May Bristol.

With the developments of cloning cells, genetic profiling, mind-altering antibiotics and even virtual rape, the attorneys of Crane, Constable, McNeil &amp; Montero find themselves with an ongoing case-load of precedent-setting cases. In a time when lawyers can go before judges as holograms, the firm takes on such morally and ethically ambiguous cases as parents suing their doctor for withholding critical results of their unborn child&#x27;s genetic mapping; defending a man accused of robbery for &quot;stealing&quot; back his identity from his ex-fiancée who has uploaded his presence and personality; protecting the rights of a woman who has been virtually raped through nanotechnology; and trying to enforce a contract for a rock star who refused to take a risky anti-aging treatment to help his band stay on top.

In the year 2030, the United States has 52 states and universal healthcare, Oprah Winfrey is the President of the United States (her Vice President is an openly gay, retired, one-armed, four-star U.S. armed forces general) and the moon has been colonized. Genes for homosexuality and deviant behavior have been discovered but genetic engineering allows said genes to be deactivated which as a result has impacted the artistic community greatly.

==Cast==

===Main===
* Nestor Carbonell as Tom Montero
* Viola Davis as Hannah Crane
* Héctor Elizondo as Martin Constable
* Eric Schaeffer as Darwin McNeil
* Ioan Gruffudd as Lukas Gold
* Kristin Lehman as Lee May Bristol

===Recurring===
* Shannon Walker Williams as Voxy/model
* José Zúñiga as Attorney Randall Purgaman

==Episodes==
==Broadcast and release==
&quot;Century City&quot; aired on the American CBS television network on Tuesday evenings and premiered on March 16, 2004. CBS ordered nine episodes, but broadcast only four before cancelling the series. Universal HD began broadcasting episodes on November 29, 2004, including previously unaired episodes.

In June 2009 Hulu made all nine episodes available for online viewing; however, they are cropped from their original widescreen presentations. They also bear an NBC logo, despite being a CBS program, due to Universal Television owning the series.

===Chronological order===
The episodes were originally aired out of chronological order, mostly regarding the appearances of the character Voxxy and the other characters&#x27; knowledge of Lee May&#x27;s genetic enhancements. The intended order is as follows, and was used by Hulu:

<text>The Edisonian approach to invention is characterized by trial and error discovery rather than a systematic theoretical approach. An often quoted example of the Edisonian approach is the successful but protracted process Thomas Edison is reported to have used to develop a practical incandescent light bulb. Inventor Nikola Tesla is quoted as saying &quot;[Edison&#x27;s] method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labour&quot; (Wills I. (2019) The Edisonian Method: Trial and Error. In: Thomas Edison: Success and Innovation through Failure. Studies in History and Philosophy of Science).

==Trial and error (hunt and try)==
Based on detailed study of his notebooks a number of scholars have pointed out that Edison generally resorted to trial and error in the absence of, or lack of awareness of, adequate theories. For example, in developing the carbon microphone (or carbon grain transmitter) that became the basis of telephones of the next hundred years, Edison and his co-workers tried hundreds of substances, finally settling on lamp black as the variable resistance medium. Edison could not use theory to solve this problem because, as Gorman and Carlson note, at the time &quot;no one had yet developed a chemical theory that Edison could have used to identify a form of carbon with the electrical properties he wanted&quot; (Gorman and Carlson, 1990).

Edison was not alone in using trial and error (more accurately termed by Hughes as &quot;hunt and try&quot;) because he, like others, was working at the edges of contemporary theory. Thomas Midgley (who held a PhD and was the inventor of tetraethyl lead and halogenated hydrocarbon refrigerants) said of trial and error, &quot;the trick is to turn a wild goose chase into a fox hunt&quot; (quoted in Hughes 2004).

Edison used a &quot;bottom-up theoretical approach&quot; when developing electric lighting, undertaking detailed analysis of the whole electric lighting system based on Joule&#x27;s and Ohm&#x27;s laws. This led him to conclude that to be economically successful he had to produce a high resistance lamp (around 100 ohms). (Friedel and Israel 1987) Once he had established the need for a high resistance lamp he was faced with a lack of optical emission theories to describe the behaviour of materials when heated to incandescence. It was then that he embarked on a systematic search for a suitable material and for the techniques to manufacture it in economic volumes.

==Edison&#x27;s method==
Historian Thomas Hughes (1977) describes the features of Edison&#x27;s method. In summary, they are:

*Hughes says, &quot;In formulating problem-solving ideas, he was inventing; in developing inventions, his approach was akin to engineering; and in looking after financing and manufacturing and other post-invention and development activities, he was innovating.&quot; 
*Edison &quot;Adroitly chose&quot; problems that made use of what he already knew.
*Edison&#x27;s method was to invent systems rather than components of systems. Edison did not just invent a light bulb, he invented an economically viable system of lighting including its generators, cables, metering and so on.
*Edison invented by repeatedly trying devices in more complex environments to progressively approximate their final use conditions.
*Edison blended invention with economics. His electric lighting system was designed to be an economic competitor with gas lighting.
*Edison assembled and organized the resources that would lead to successful inventions:
**Men with skills that would aid the task.
**Equipment – machines, instruments, chemicals etc.
**Literature on the subject. He started a project with a thorough literature review.
**An environment where the purpose was invention not something else like manufacturing.
*Edison was a charismatic leader who drew on the ideas of those who worked with him.
*Edison was obsessive in his pursuit of outcomes, not allowing things like a lack of sleep, or cost, to deter him.
*Contrary to common opinion Edison made use of the scientific method but in a way that was limited to the task at hand and did not seek to develop generalized theories.
*A key to Edison&#x27;s intellectual approach was to always doubt and never take things for granted.
*Edison made effective use of metaphors when picturing his inventions.
*He had a significant ability to grasp quantitative relationships despite his limited mathematical training.
*He worked by conceiving an idea and working towards achieving it.
*Edison (And his co-workers) possessed excellent manual dexterity.
*Edison was also very effective at sketching, enabling him to conceive and manipulate his ideas on paper.
*Edison did use hunt and try extensively but only when no theory existed and in a systematic rather than random manner. 
*Edison was distinguished by his ability to deal with complex change.

==Edison on literature reviews==
Edison is quoted as saying, &quot;When I want to discover something, I begin by reading up everything that has been done along that line in the past - that&#x27;s what all these books in the library are for. I see what has been accomplished at great labor and expense in the past. I gather data of many thousands of experiments as a starting point, and then I make thousands more.&quot;

<doc id="496614" wikidata="Q325819" url="?curid=496614" title="Saitama Seibu Lions">
<text>The are a professional baseball team in Japan&#x27;s Pacific League based north of Tokyo in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture. Before 1979, they were based in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, in Kyushu. The team is owned by a subsidiary of Seibu Railway, which in turn is owned by the Seibu Holdings. The team experienced a recent period of financial difficulty, but the situation brightened when the team received a record ¥6 billion (about $51.11 million) posting fee from the Boston Red Sox for the right to negotiate a contract with Daisuke Matsuzaka. Between 1978 and 2008, the team logo and mascot were based on the adult version of Kimba the White Lion, a classic Japanese anime and manga series by Osamu Tezuka. In 2004, former Seibu Lions player Kazuo Matsui became the first Japanese infielder to play in Major League Baseball.

==Franchise history==
===Nishitetsu Clippers (1950)===
In 1950, the team became a founding member of the Pacific League. It was then owned by a private railroad company Nishi-Nippon Railroad, well known as &quot;Nishitetsu&quot;, which was based in Fukuoka in Kyushu, the western area of Japan (Nishi-Nippon). The Clippers name was chosen as Nishitetsu was in charge of Pan American Airlines&#x27; Japanese operations (back then, Pan Am&#x27;s jets were known as &quot;Clippers&quot; due to them being aeronautical Boeing 314 Clipper). The team finished sixth that year, and at the end of the season, Nishitetsu was merged with another professional baseball club in Fukuoka, the Nishi-Nippon Pirates, which belonged to the Central League and managed by a local newspaper company the Nishinippon Shimbun. The new club was to form the Nishitetsu Lions. Thus the Lions name was adopted and has been retained up to today as the name of the franchise.

===Nishitetsu Lions (1951–1972)===
The Nishitetsu Lions called Heiwadai Stadium home for their entire existence. They were one of the most dominant teams in the Pacific League during the 1950s, winning four pennants, including three straight Japan Series against the Yomiuri Giants behind famed manager Osamu Mihara; their last championship in Fukuoka came in 1958; after which Mihara left for the Taiyo Whales and led them to a Japan Series championship over the Daimai Orions in 1960.

The team struggled through the following decade and did not witness much success on the field. In 1969 and 1970, the team was caught up in the infamous Black Mist game-fixing scandal, which resulted in four Lions pitchers being banned from NPB for life, as well as other players receiving lesser punishments. These losses decimated the team which the team would not recover from for the rest of their time in Fukuoka, which finished the 1970 season in last place.

After a third straight last-place finish, and with Nishi-Nippon not wanting to do with anything to the team due to the Black Mist Scandal, in November 1972, the franchise was sold to the Fukuoka Baseball Corporation, a shell company within Nishi-Nippon Railroad. Following the sale, the team was renamed the Taiheiyo Club Lions.

===Taiheiyo Club Lions (1973–1976)===
Nishi-Nippon Railroad, founded by Nagayoshi Nakamura, then owner of Lotte Corporation and the Orions, sold the team&#x27;s sponsorship rights to Taiheiyo Club, a golf course and resort developer in 1973. The Lions, still smarting from the after-effects of the Black Mist Scandal, finished no higher than third throughout the 1970s.

===Crown Lighter Lions (1977–1978)===
At the end of the 1976 season, the Fukuoka Baseball Corporation announced that the team&#x27;s new sponsor was Crown Gas Lighter. With this, the team&#x27;s name for the upcoming season was changed to the Crown Lighter Lions. On October 25, 1978, the team was sold to Kokudo Keikaku (later Kokudo), and then merged into Prince Hotels.

===Seibu Lions (1979–2007)===
Following the sale of the Crown Lighter Lions and their merging into Prince Hotels, the team was renamed the Seibu Lions and relocated to a new ballpark northward in Tokorozawa, Saitama, west of the Tokyo area. Fukuoka would be left without an NPB team until , when the erstwhile Nankai Hawks were bought by Daiei (they are now owned by the SoftBank Group) and moved to the Lions&#x27; former stadium, Heiwadai Stadium.

====Golden Age (1982–1994)====
The Lions finished in last place in (something the team would not do again until ), and finished in fourth place in and . However, the following seasons would mark the beginning of a period of sustained success for the team under new manager Tatsuro Hirooka and with star players such as Osamu Higashio and Kōichi Tabuchi. Tatsuro Hirooka told the players that meat and other animal foods increase athletes&#x27; susceptibility to injury, and decrease their ability to perform. He required all players to take up a strictly vegetarian diet. The club won consecutive Japan Series in and , and went to the Japan Series again in , but lost to the Hanshin Tigers, who won their first Japan Series title. That Japan Series was also notable for the Tigers also breaking tradition by becoming the first Central League club to use the designated hitter during the Japan Series, prior to the NPB requiring its use during the Japan Series in Pacific League stadiums in 1990 (with it eventually being also used in interleague play when it was introduced in 2005).

Following the 1986 season, the club replaced Hirooka with Masaaki Mori, who was able to sustain the team&#x27;s prolonged success. Mori won eight league championships, between 1986 and 1988 and 1990–1994, and six Japan Series championships in his nine-year managing career, winning the Japan Series in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, and 1992.

The team gained the moniker &quot;Invincible Seibu&quot; during the 1980s and 1990s due to their sustained domination of the league. The Lions had a powerful lineup in this period, loaded with sluggers such as Koji Akiyama, Kazuhiro Kiyohara and Orestes Destrade. Their defense also benefited from the services of skilled players such as Hiromichi Ishige, Romeo Calhoun, Hatsuhiko Tsuji and catcher Tsutomu Ito. Among the pitchers employed by the Lions in this period was &quot;The Oriental Express&quot; Taigen Kaku, Kimiyasu Kudoh, Hisanobu Watanabe, and relievers Yoshitaka Katori and Tetsuya Shiozaki.

===== Prominent Golden Age Players =====
===Saitama Seibu Lions (2008–)===
In order to reinforce the affiliation between the team and their home region, the Lions added the prefecture name &quot;Saitama&quot; to their team name in 2008. They were Pacific League Champions that year and went on to win the Japan Series. The team logo and uniforms were further modified for the 2009 season, with the team trading in their traditional light-blue colour scheme for a dark blue design similar to that employed during the Nishitetsu Lions era in the 1950s and 1960s. Between 2010 and 2019, the Lions made the Pacific League Climax Series 1st stage 5 times, (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017) but lost to the Chiba Lotte Marines in 2010 and 2013, the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in 2017, and to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2011 and 2012. They made the Final Stage twice in back to back years in 2018 and 2019, but lost to the Hawks on both occasions. In 2020, the team finished in 3rd place, but was unable to make the playoffs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pacific League removed the First Stage of the playoffs; only the top 2 teams in Pacific League made the playoffs, while Central League removed it entirely, instead opting to send the regular season champion (Yomiuri Giants) straight to the Japan Series. In 2021, the Lions finished in 6th and last place for the first time since 1979 with a 55–70–18 record.

<doc id="496615" wikidata="Q4765220" url="?curid=496615" title="Animutation">
<text>Animutation or fanimutation is a form of web-based computer animation, typically created in Adobe Flash and characterized by unpredictable montages of pop-culture images set to music, often in a language foreign to the intended viewers. It is not to be confused with manual collage animation (e.g., the work of Stan Vanderbeek and Terry Gilliam), which predates the Internet.

==History==
Animutation was popularized by Neil Cicierega. Cicierega claims to have been inspired by several sources, including bizarre Japanese commercials and Martin Holmström&#x27;s &quot;Hatten är din&quot; Soramimi-style video made for the &quot;Habbeetik&quot; song by Azar Habib. The term animutation is a portmanteau of &quot;animation&quot; and &quot;mutation&quot; and was popularized in 2001 through Cicierega&#x27;s flash animations such as &quot;Japanese Pokerap&quot; and &quot;Hyakugojyuuichi!!&quot;, which feature the credits music from older episodes of Pokémon. The popularity of &quot;Hyakugojyuuichi!!&quot; quickly made it an Internet phenomenon. Since that time, others have adopted a similar style and communities of similarly minded animators have sprung up around the web. These versions made by fans were christened &quot;fanimutations&quot;.

==Recurring themes==
===Audio===
Animutations can be based on songs of foreign, independent, or mainstream origin. Japanese songs were used in many of the original animutations by Neil Cicierega, but newer animutations use songs in a wide variety of languages, including English, Dutch and gibberish.
The foreign language songs are often &quot;misheard&quot; into English by the creators and added as subtitles. The words are not translations but soramimis, English words that sound roughly the same as the original lyrics. For example, the animutation title &quot;French erotic film&quot; is a soramimi of the original Dutch lyrics &quot;Weet je wat ik wil&quot; in an Ome Henk song. The actual translation of the lyrics is &quot;Do you know what I want?&quot;

===Recurring motifs===
Though animutations are close in relation to the random nonsense of dadaism and can be entirely unpredictable, they sometimes exhibit recurring memes among them as a result of being influenced by each other and internet culture. Among the many recurring motifs found in animutations are:
*The inclusion of Canadian comedian Colin Mochrie from &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; Regularly, a picture of Mochrie&#x27;s head superimposed into a crudely drawn sun is also used. This inclusion is largely due to Neil Cicierega&#x27;s fixation on the comedian.
*The inclusion of Harry Potter in various forms, often edited in a bizarre fashion. Neil Cicierega, also a creator of the Potter Puppet Pals, is responsible from the outset explosion of Harry Potter&#x27;s use in animutation, most notably starting in Hyakugojyuuichi.
*Obscure pop-culture references, typically catchphrases or images.
*Random cartoon characters, usually from children&#x27;s television programs or anime, although obscure characters are also used.

===Non-traditional interfaces===
While many flash animations have a &quot;replay button&quot; at the end, animutations often use a silly graphic which animates when interacted with, included with instructions on how to replay the animutation. For instance, at the end of &quot;Cold Heart&quot;, the title character is holding a package of Mentos mints, which serves as the replay button. The package slightly increases in size when moused over, and text at the bottom of the video informs the user to &quot;Click the Mentos to replay!&quot;.

Similarly to the replay button, a progress animation is used in many animutations, especially the later creations. For example, in &quot;Jesus H. Christ&quot;, a papier-mâché goose which was originally in a &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episode was used as a pointer, rotating clockwise to indicate the animation&#x27;s playback progress.

<doc id="496617" wikidata="Q388581" url="?curid=496617" title="Second Battle of Gaza">
<text>The Second Battle of Gaza was fought on 17–19 April 1917, following the defeat of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) at the First Battle of Gaza in March, during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. Gaza was defended by the strongly entrenched Ottoman Army garrison, which had been reinforced after the first battle by substantial forces. They manned the town&#x27;s defences and a line of strong redoubts which extended eastwards along the road from Gaza to Beersheba. The defenders were attacked by the Eastern Force&#x27;s three infantry divisions, supported by two mounted divisions, but the strength of the defenders, their entrenchments &amp; supporting artillery decimated the attackers.

As a result of the EEF victories at the Battle of Romani, the Battle of Magdhaba, and the Battle of Rafa, fought from August 1916 to January 1917, the EEF had pushed the defeated Ottoman Army eastwards. The EEF reoccupied the Egyptian territory of the Sinai Peninsula and crossed over into the Ottoman Empire territory of southern Palestine. However, the result of the First Battle of Gaza had been as close to a British Empire victory as a defeat could get. In the three weeks between the two battles, the Gaza defences were strongly reinforced against a frontal attack. The strong entrenchments and fortifications proved unassailable during the disastrous frontal attacks, and EEF casualties approached, and in some cases exceeded, 50% for only slight gains.

==Background==
===Strategic situation===
An 11 January War Cabinet decision to reduce large scale operations in Palestine was reversed on the 26 February Anglo-French Congress, and the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) was now required to capture the stronghold of Gaza as a first step towards Jerusalem. Gaza was one of the most ancient cities in the world, being one of five city-states mentioned in the Bible as ruled by the Philistines, and had been fought over many times during its 4,000-year history. The Egyptians and the Assyrians had attacked Gaza, followed in 731 BC by the Greeks, with Alexander conducting three attacks and the Siege of Gaza in 332 BC. The town was completely destroyed in 96 BC and rebuilt slightly to the south of the original site. This Gaza was captured by Caliph Omar in 635 AD, by Saladin in 1187 AD, and by Napoleon in 1799. At Gaza there was an important depot for cereals with a German steam mill, barley, wheat, olives, vineyards, orange groves, and wood for fuel were grown as well as many goats grazed. Barley was exported to England for brewing into English beer and in 1912 the 40,000 inhabitants of Gaza imported £10,000 of yarn from Manchester. Maize, millet, beans, and water melon, all harvested in early autumn, were cultivated in most of these localities.
All of the Desert Column mounted and infantry divisions had fought during the first battle of Gaza, when the column&#x27;s 53rd (Welsh) Division had been heavily involved. This &quot;encounter battle&quot; by the mounted divisions emphasised speed and surprise, at a time when Gaza had been an outpost garrisoned by a strong detachment on the flank of a line stretching inland from the Mediterranean Sea.

While the Desert Column&#x27;s Anzac Mounted Division and the partly formed Imperial Mounted Division had quickly deployed to guard against Ottoman reinforcements strengthening the Ottoman garrison at Gaza on 26 March, the 53rd (Welsh) Division supported by a brigade from the 54th (East Anglian) Division attacked the strong entrenchments to the south of the town. In the afternoon, after being reinforced by the Anzac Mounted Division, the all arms&#x27; attack quickly began to succeed. With most objectives captured, night stopped the attack and a withdrawal was ordered before the commanders were fully aware of the victory. The first battle ended in debacle, according to Pugsley when the Anzac Mounted Division &quot;knew they were winning, and saw victory snatched away from them by the order to withdraw.&quot; This defeat coincided with low public morale in the British Empire reflecting the continuing Allied failures on the Western Front. General Archibald Murray commanding the EEF reported the defeat at Gaza to the War Office in overly optimistic terms such that his reputation, as a consequence, depended on a decisive victory at the second attempt. The commander of Eastern Force, Lieutenant General Charles Dobell, also indicated a substantial victory and Murray was ordered to move on and capture Jerusalem. The British were in no position to attack Jerusalem as they had yet to break through the Ottoman defences at Gaza. However, the Australian official historian described the First Battle of Gaza quite differently. &quot;In itself the engagement was a severe blow to the British Army, since it affected the troops on both sides to a degree out of all proportion to the casualties suffered, or to the negative victory gained by the Turks. There was not a single private in the British infantry, or a trooper in the mounted brigades, who did not believe that failure was due to staff bungling and to nothing else.&quot;

Preparations for the second attack included the extension of the railway to Deir el Belah, the headquarters of Eastern Force, to enable &quot;all available troops&quot; to be deployed for battle. Water reservoirs for 76,000 gallons were built in the Wadi Ghuzzee and dumps of ammunition and supply were established nearby. The weather was &quot;reasonably cool&quot; and the health of the troops &quot;was good.&quot; Morale had &quot;recovered from the disappointment of the First Battle, in which victory had so narrowly eluded them.&quot; Up until 4 April, Eastern Force had been responsible for the southern sector of the Suez Canal Defence troops, away. This duty was transferred to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, lightening Dobell&#x27;s load.

===Reorganisation of Desert Column===
Between the first and second battles of Gaza, Desert Column, commanded by Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode, was reorganised into an exclusively mounted force comprising the Anzac Mounted Division commanded by Major General Henry Chauvel and the Imperial Mounted Division commanded by Major General Henry Hodgson, each with four brigades. Desert Column was to cover the infantry&#x27;s right flank and attack Ottoman forces along the Gaza to Beersheba road as far as Hareira. The 1st and 4th Light Horse Brigades were ordered forward to join their divisions, to make up four brigades, in each. The Anzac Mounted Division consisted of the 1st and 2nd Light Horse, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle, and the 22nd Mounted Brigades. The Imperial Mounted Division consisted of the 3rd and the recently reformed 4th Light Horse with the 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. The 4th Light Horse Brigade arrived at Khan Yunus on 11 April and after dumping baggage was preparing to move forward on 14 April, carrying the Light Mobile Scale of six emergency pack bags per squadron, three days rations, and grain on each horse.

===Reconnaissance operations===
On 1 April, a reconnaissance mission was carried out east of Wadi Ghuzze between Wadi esh Sheria and the sea by one battalion each from the 52nd (Lowland), 53rd (Welsh), and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions. The next day 1,000 Ottoman infantry advanced to the right bank of the Wadi Ghuzze. Both sides conducted day and night patrols. The 10th Light Horse Regiment&#x27;s Scouts led a reconnaissance by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade east of the Wadi el Ghuzze, when Ottoman artillery was very active during a skirmish with an Ottoman cavalry patrol, some miles beyond the EEF front line.

Joseph W. McPherson, an officer in the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps was invited by two Royal Engineer messmates to accompany them on a reconnaissance during the afternoon of Good Friday, 6 April 1917. He subsequently wrote, &quot;we saw parties of Turks and mapped down new trenches they had made, got sniped at incidentally, and had to travel a good bit of the way on our bellies.&quot;

===Air war===
Aerial reconnaissance was carried out by both sides. Aerial photographs enabled a new partly contoured map on the 1/40,000 scale to be printed before the Second Battle of Gaza. However, each side was keen to monitor the others&#x27; preparations and the air became disputed territory. Newly arrived German aircraft attacked EEF reconnaissance aircraft during which several duels were fought, none being decisive. On 6 April five German aircraft approaching Rafa were intercepted by two AFC Martinsyde aircraft, one of which was forced to land and was destroyed on the ground, while the other went for reinforcements. Three Martinsydes arrived to attack the German formation. Aerial bombing was also strenuously continued by both sides, and while this aerial fight was taking place, hostile aircraft bombed Bir el Mazar. On 7 April a joint raid by four Australian aircraft, with several from No. 14 Squadron, bombed Gaza and the Ramleh aerodrome, hitting two hangars. At El Arish hospital, Dr. Duguid described the strong moon light on 8 April 1917, &quot;... now it is climbing the heavens. 10.30pm. It is as clear as day, and the shadow thrown on the sand is very definite. I hear we are expecting an air raid soon. The regiments are digging funk holes everywhere.&quot;

Rafa was bombed twice on 12 April by three German aircraft, after which 17 aircraft from the combined EEF squadrons bombed Ottoman positions along the Beersheba line, dropping 1,000 lbs of bombs each on Huj and Kh. el Bir. Retaliatory raids followed in quick succession before midday and continued on during the three subsequent days, accompanied by increased heavy artillery fire from both sides.

==Prelude==
===Defending forces===
During the three weeks between the first two battles for Gaza, the town was quickly developed into the strongest point in a series of strongly entrenched positions extending to Hareira east of Gaza, and southeast towards Beersheba. They increased the width and depth of their front lines, developing mutually supporting localities on ideal defensive ground. The construction of these defences changed the nature of the attack to an infantry frontal attack across open ground, with mounted troops in a supporting role.

The Ottoman force defended of entrenched defences supported by well concealed and sighted guns. The positions held by the force commanded by Kress von Kressenstein began on their right flank on the Mediterranean coast, which was strongly entrenched. Next, Gaza and the country to the east of the city was dominated by wired trenches situated on rising ground, while the line towards Beersheba was less strongly fortified. The German and Ottoman forces&#x27; well-prepared positions emphasised &quot;the advantages of defence by areas as opposed to linear defence, at least by day and in clear weather.&quot; The well-sited redoubts covering wide gaps provided mutual support and facilitated a large reserve force outside the danger zone, which was available to take advantage of counterattack opportunities. The defences at Atawineh, Sausage Ridge, Hareira, and Teiaha supported each other as they overlooked an almost flat plain, making any attack against them almost impossible.

After the first battle an additional two regiments of the 53rd Division, four artillery batteries, and some cavalry reinforced the defences. The force defending the town of Gaza and the western coastal sector consisted of:
:3rd Infantry Division
::31st Infantry Regiment (two battalions including machine guns)
::32nd Infantry Regiment (two battalions including machine guns)
::Two machine gun companies
::Four batteries of field artillery
::Austrian mountain howitzer batteries
::One howitzer battery
:One regiment of the 16th Infantry Division

:Group Tiller, a total of seven infantry battalions
::79th Infantry Regiment
::2nd Battalion, 81st Infantry Regiment
::125th Infantry Regiment
::One squadron of cavalry
::One company of camelry
::12 heavy mountain howitzers in two Austrian howitzer batteries
::Two long guns in the German 10-cm battery from Pasha I
::Two Ottoman field artillery batteries.

At Hareira
:One regiment of the 16th Infantry Division

At Tel esh Sheria (Force Headquarters)
:16th Infantry Division and one regiment, either of the 47th Infantry Regiment or the 48th Infantry Regiment
:3rd Cavalry Division&#x27;s 1,500 swords

At Kh Sihan
:53rd Division
:Two battalions of the 79th Regiment (16th Infantry Division)
::Four batteries
::Some cavalry

At Beersheba
:Two battalions of the 79th Regiment (16th Infantry Division)
::One artillery battery

They were supported by the 7th and 54th Infantry Divisions of the XX Corps and 3,000 reinforcements from the 23rd and 24th Infantry Divisions of the XII Corps.

The British estimated 21,000 Ottoman defenders at Gaza and Tel esh Sheria, 4,500 at Kh. Sihan, with a further 2,000 at Atawineh. Other British estimates include 25,000 German and Ottoman troops in the area, with 8,500 at Gaza, 4,500 east of Gaza, 2,000 in the Atawineh redoubt, and 6,000 at Hareira and Tel el Sheria about halfway between Gaza and Beersheba. The official British historian notes there &quot;were 18,000 rifles on the front&quot; during this second battle, including the Beersheba detachment. The ration strength of the defending force was 48,845, including 18,185 armed with rifles, 86 armed with machine guns. Although they had a total of 101 artillery pieces, only 68 guns were in action during the battle, 12 of which were larger than field-gun calibre. The War Office thought there could be 30,000 Ottoman troops in southern Palestine with the Gaza–Beersheba line, defended by about 18,000 men.

On 10 April, Dobell understood that Gaza was defended by three regiments, with two regiments east of the town, two regiments at Hareira, and one each at Tel esh Sheria and near Huj, with potential for mutual support. Just before the attack, it was understood that an Ottoman force of 21,000 held the ground between Tel esh Sheria and Gaza, including 8,500 at Gaza, 4,000 at Kh el Bir, and 2,000 at Atawineh. On 15 April 1917, the Ottoman forces were estimated at 1,500 to 2,000 cavalry, 60 to 70 guns, and 20,000 to 25,000 infantry holding the Sheria, Hareira to Gaza line with a small reserve near Akra.

===Attacking forces===
Murray ordered Dobell to attack Gaza with three infantry divisions. These were the 52nd (Lowland) Division commanded by Major General W. E. B. Smith, the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division commanded by Brigadier General Stanley Mott (replacing Major General Alister Dallas who resigned due to poor health after the first battle), and the 54th (East Anglian) Division commanded by Major General S. W. Hare. The 52nd (Lowland) Division had not been involved in fighting since the Battle of Romani eight months ago, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division and to a lesser extent, the 54th (East Anglian) Division had both been involved in the first battle. These two divisions had been almost up to establishment levels before the battle, but they were now on average about 1,500 below establishment. The approximate 4,000 casualties suffered during the first battle had been suffered, &quot;almost entirely by the 53rd Division&quot;, although the 161st Brigade (54th Division) had also suffered &quot;particularly heavy losses&quot;, remaining in divisional reserve during the second battle. It is not known what reinforcements the 53rd (Welsh) Division received during the period between the two battles. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division, which had been hastily formed from 18 dismounted yeomanry regiments, was now complete except for artillery and one field company. The Division arrived and on 7 April took over the outpost line along the Wadi Ghuzzee from the 54th (East Anglian) Division. The infantry would be supported by the Desert Column&#x27;s two mounted divisions, each consisting of four brigades.

====Artillery and armour====
Eastern Force had 170 guns, 16 of which were of medium or larger calibre. With the arrival of railhead at Deir el Belah on 5 April, more medium artillery was transported forward. These included all 12 of the 60-pounder guns, the 201st Siege Battery of two 8-inch and 6-inch howitzers and the third brigades of the 53rd (Welsh) and the 54th (East Anglian) Division&#x27;s field artillery, and represented the only additional artillery received between the first and second battles. By 18 April all heavy guns had been registered on their targets by artillery aircraft flying up and down the line, marking every flash.

A detachment of eight heavy Mark I tanks from the Tank Corps (also known as Heavy Section, Machine Gun Corps) reached the front. Tanks had been in use in France since September 1916 and Palestine was to be the only other theatre of the war they were employed. They &quot;seemed to offer the best chance of a successful frontal assault.&quot; Lyden-Bell reported to the War Office that they would frighten the defenders &quot;out of their lives.&quot; Senior officers apparently deployed them for this purpose in widely separated pairs.

The tanks which arrived in Palestine in January 1917 had been used for instruction and were not of the latest type, however during a trial attack they proved themselves in the sandy conditions. &quot;[T]he sand though fairly heavy, did not interfere with them in the least. They buzzed along most satisfactorily.&quot; They worked well in sand so long as the treads were not greased, which was the normal practice. The tank, &quot;War Baby&quot; was powered by a 105-horsepower engine. It had a revolver, loop holes, periscopes, dynamos and differentiator, and was armed with four Hotchkiss machine guns and two auxiliary guns. This tank was manned by one officer sitting beside the driver, four gunners on bike seats and two greasers.

The tanks were to be deployed along the front and advance across open country where they could give shelter to the infantry following behind them. However, as the tanks became targets the infantry also suffered, and only two tanks succeeded in reaching their objectives. A supply of 4,000 rounds of 4.5-inch gas shells was received by the EEF. These were to be the first gas shells used in the Palestine campaign.

====Aerial support====
A total of 25 aircraft were available in the 5th Wing, including 17 B.E.2s and eight Martinsydes which, although being the best fighters available, tended to overheat. At this time, the 5th Wing headquarters, the headquarters of No. 14 Squadron along with its &quot;A&quot; Flight and No. 67 Squadron A.F.C., were all stationed at Rafa. No. 14 Squadron&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; Flight and advanced headquarters were located at Deir el Belah, while &quot;X&quot; Aircraft Park was across the Suez Canal at Abbassia, with the Advanced Aircraft Park on the canal at Kantara.

During the three days of the second battle, EEF artillery aircraft flew 38 missions and engaged 63 targets. They located 27 batteries, despite difficulties identifying targets through the haze and dust caused by the bombardment, and being attacked by hostile aircraft. Nevertheless, 128 direct hits were recorded by the artillery and three guns destroyed, while German and Ottoman anti-aircraft artillery caused the death of three pilots and the loss of two aircraft.

====Medical support====
All the camels of the mounted field ambulances remained at Dier el Belah during the fighting except for a small proportion which moved forward, but ambulance men and transport remained at Deir el Belah during the fighting. As the attacks were made across open country without any cover, many casualties had to be collected in full view of the enemy. Evacuations from Desert Column were carried out by 36 Ford ambulance wagons, six from each division, with a convoy of 24 operating between divisional receiving stations at Tel el Jenimi and the 53rd British Casualty Clearing Station at Deir el Belah. Then they were transported back to the No. 2 Australian Stationary Hospital at El Arish on the railway before continuing their journey back to Kantara.

====Dobell&#x27;s plan====
Dobell and Murray discussed the advantages of a flank attack on Gaza from the east, instead of a frontal attack. However, the lack of water in the area towards Beersheba put it beyond the resources of the EEF in April 1917. Dobell therefore planned a direct frontal attack on the well-prepared Ottoman defences. He would employ all his available force to &quot;crush&quot; the main positions defending Gaza, while Desert Column advanced on the right flank, in preparation for a pursuit.

The assault would be made in two stages. Firstly the 52nd (Lowland) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions would attack and capture Sheikh Abbas and make a general advance of beyond the Wady Ghuzzee, to place the infantry in a position to launch the main attack on Gaza. These two divisions, with the 74th (Yeomanry) Division in reserve, would advance east of the Es Sire Ridge with the 53rd (Welsh) Division, advancing between the Rafa to Gaza road and the Mediterranean coast. They would subsequently entrench and wire their new forward line, stretching from Tel el Ujul on the Mediterranean shore to Es Sir Ridge, along the Manusra Ridge to Sheikh Abbas, where an infantry brigade would strengthen the defences. This attack was to be covered by the Desert Column, operating to the east and southeast to stop reinforcements, moving from Hareira and Tel esh Sheria, from reinforcing Gaza.

Secondly, as soon as preparations were complete and allowing at least one clear day between the two stages, the 52nd (Lowland), the 53rd (Welsh), and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions, supported by the Imperial Camel Brigade, were to launch the main attack on Gaza from the south, southwest, and southeast. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division would form the reserve, while their right flank was protected by Desert Column. The Column was to &quot;protect the right of the infantry from an advance by the enemy in and beyond the entrenchments at Atawineh and Hareira on the Gaza to Beersheba road.&quot; They also had orders to exploit an infantry breakthrough and attack Hareira on the extreme right, and they carried rations for the next day along with an iron ration.

According to Falls, &quot;Some subordinate commanders&quot; suggested a concentrated infantry attack in depth on the coastal side of Gaza, &quot;offered far more favourable opportunities&quot; for an infantry attack. Some infantry divisional commanders considered the artillery insufficient for the width of the proposed attack. They thought a more narrowly focused attack would make better use of the available artillery. Chetwode and Chauvel, &quot;the two most experienced generals in the force&quot;, watched the extension of the Ottoman defences at Gaza with &quot;some foreboding.&quot; They had seen the strength and determination of Ottoman defenders in entrenched positions at the Battle of Magdhaba and the Battle of Rafa.

After receiving fresh information regarding Ottoman deployments on 10 April, Dobell modified his plan to incorporate a more flexible approach. While the first stage would remain unchanged, during the second stage of the battle he might attack directly by swinging his line slightly northeast, with only one division attacking Gaza to create a gap for Desert Column, depending on whether the hostile Atawineh defences were reinforced by units from the Hareira detachment. Or he might send most of his force to the coastal side of Gaza to make an attack there.

==Battle==
===Preliminary move: 16 April===
By 16 April Murray had moved his advanced GHQ EEF in a railway train, from El Arish to Khan Yunis, and was in telephone communication with Dobell&#x27;s Eastern Force battle headquarters at Deir el Belah, south of the Wadi Ghuzzee. Meanwhile, Chetwode moved his Desert Column headquarters from near In Seirat to Tel el Jemmi.

Just after 19:00, the infantry divisions marched towards the Wadi Ghuzzee crossings, while the Anzac Mounted Division left Deir el Belah at 18:30 with the New Zealand Mounted Brigade leading the night march. At 04:30 on 17 April the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment led the way across the Wadi Ghuzzee at the Shellal ford, followed by the remainder of the Anzac Mounted Division. The Imperial Mounted Division closed its headquarters at Deir el Belah and reopened at Tel el Jemmi. At 15:45 the 3rd Light Horse Brigade left Goz el Taire to take up an outpost line at Jemmi, while the 4th Light Horse, 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades were in the bivouac area by 22:00. The 5th Mounted Brigade moved out at 01:30 on 17 April with orders to capture Kh Erk.

===Initial assault: 17 and 18 April===

The Second Battle of Gaza began on 17 April 1917 and lasted three days. Operating as &quot;Eastern Attack&quot; commanded by W. E. B. Smith, the 52nd (Lowland) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions were to capture a line from Sheikh Abbas, through Mansura to Kurd Hill on the Es Sire Ridge as quickly as possible, and entrench their new positions. These two divisions were deployed for the attack, the 54th (East Anglian) Division on the right and the 52nd (Lowland) Division on the left, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division advanced across the Wadi Ghuzzee, west of the Rafa-Gaza road to Tel el Ujul, to establish an outpost line in the sand dunes covering the 52nd (Lowland) Division&#x27;s left flank, with the 74th (Yeomanry) Division in reserve.
Two tanks attached to the 163rd (Norfolk &amp; Suffolk) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division, started their advance from Dumb-bell Hill at 04:30, but the leading tank was put out of action after being hit by three shells. The attack on Sheikh Abbas succeeded by 07:00 when the area was occupied and work began to fortify and entrench the position. The advance by the 52nd (Lowland) Division was more strongly opposed but after their 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade captured the Ottoman outpost at El Burjabye, they were able to occupy Mansura Ridge. Here their advance was brought to a halt when they were targeted by Ottoman artillery firing from Ali Muntar. Despite this, the captured position was consolidated. During the day a fortified line was constructed from Sheikh Ailin to Sheikh Abbas about from Gaza. With the capture of the Mansura Ridges, a line from there to the sea, about from the Wadi Ghuzzeh was established.
At daylight, tanks moved round the Mansura Ridge to destroy any remaining Ottoman posts, but the terrain was unsuitable and they were stopped by Ottoman artillery. Eastern Attack suffered 300 casualties, but all the objectives they had captured had been defended only by Ottoman outposts.
Desert Column&#x27;s role during the day was to protect the right flank of the 54th (East Anglian) Division and &quot;demonstrate against Hareira.&quot; The 5th Mounted Brigade (Imperial Mounted Division) crossed the Wadi Ghazze at 02:30 and moved up the Wadi esh Sheria to occupy Kh. Erk south southwest of Hareira, at dawn. A patrol of the 1/1st Worcestershire Yeomanry (5th Mounted Brigade) cut the telegraph line between Hairpin and Hareira redoubts, taking out of line and removing the insulators. Meanwhile, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (Anzac Mounted Division) drove in an Ottoman outpost, during their advance towards Hareira. The Anzac Mounted Division, &quot;watched the country to the south east&quot;, during the day while being frequently bombed. Field ambulances in the rear were also bombed. The Imperial Mounted Division remained at Desert Column headquarters at Tel el Jemmi. From noon, the New Zealanders held a line near Im Siri on the Shellal to Beersheba road, from where they saw a great deal of movement around Tel esh Sheria, and the Beersheba to Ramleh railway viaduct at Irgeig. At dusk the 22nd Mounted Brigade of yeomanry continued to hold the outpost line, while the remainder of the Anzac Mounted Division retired to Shellal to water.

The following day, on 18 April while the infantry consolidated their positions and prepared for battle, and an EEF artillery bombardment of hostile positions from the land and sea was reciprocated. During this artillery duel, the guns searched for the positions of the Ottoman artillery, EEF artillery, and shipboard guns targeting Gaza and Hareira positions. Also during the day, the infantry was reinforced by the Imperial Mounted Divisions and the Imperial Camel Brigade. The right flank continued to be guarded by the Anzac Mounted Division, which repeated their movements of the previous day to cover the right flank of the new infantry positions, when they were subjected to frequent bombing which caused heavy casualties. Supplies of ammunition and water were brought forward to them, across the Wadi Ghuzzee.

===Exploitation: 19 April===

Following the success of the first phase of Dobell&#x27;s plans, he decided not to attempt a flanking attack from Atawineh or Hareira on Gaza, but to return to his original plan and launch a series of attacks while Desert Column pinned the defenders to their positions on the right. The 53rd (Welsh) Division, Eastern Force, and Desert Column were to attack the of entrenched Ottoman defences, which were strongly supported by well-concealed and sighted guns.

The Eastern Attack&#x27;s two infantry divisions would make the main attacks stretching from Mansura and Sheikh Abbas, then swing to the left to capture Ali Muntar before moving into the town of Gaza. This attack would cover the route taken by the Anzac Mounted Division during the first battle, to Kh. el Bir and Kh Sihan where a gap would be made for units of Desert Column to ride through. The deployments shown on the maps do not indicate any available mounted units. While this attack took place on the eastern side of Gaza, on the western side the 53rd (Welsh) Division was to capture the coastal defences in the sand dunes. Five tanks were attached to &quot;Eastern Force&quot; and two tanks attached to the 53rd (Welsh) Division, while the 74th (Yeomanry) Division would remain in reserve. The Anzac Mounted Division would extend the line eastwards from the Imperial Mounted Division, in preparation for an attack on the Atawineh redoubt, leaving the 22nd Mounted Brigade to defend the Shellal ford.

====Bombardment====
The battle began at 05:30 with a two-hour artillery bombardment during which the French coastguard ship &quot;Requin&quot;, protected by a screen of drifters and trawlers and escorted by two French destroyers, fired at Ali Muntar. French ships became involved after operations passed out of the British naval zone, which ended at El Arish. One monitor fired on the Warren on the western side of the ridge and another monitor fired on the Labyrinth. After 07:30, the ships shifted their fire to north and northwest of Gaza and north and northeast of Ali Muntar to avoid firing on the infantry. The ships were targeted by a German submarine during the afternoon which fired a torpedo at &quot;Requin&quot;&#x27;, just missing the ship.

Eastern Force heavy artillery fired on the hostile artillery batteries and strong defensive points that held up the infantry attack. For the first 40 minutes, the field howitzers fired gas shells at hostile battery positions and at the woodland area south west of Ali Muntar. Afterwards they continued their bombardment, firing high explosive shells for the remainder of the two hours. The 15th Heavy Battery shelled gun positions and trenches near Kh el Bir, the 10th Heavy Battery targeted the ridge east of Gaza to Fryer Hill, the 91st Heavy Battery fired on El Arish Redoubt, Magdhaba Trench, and hostile batteries west of Gaza, while the 6-inch howitzers of the 201st Siege Battery targeted Outpost Hill and Middlesex Hill on the Es Sire Ridge. The 8-inch howitzer fired on Green Hill and the southern Gaza defences. These guns were supplied with 500 rounds per 60-pdr and 6-inch howitzers, 400 rounds per 8-inch howitzer, 600 rounds per 4.5-inch howitzer, and 600 rounds per 18-pdr. Divisional commanders controlled the use of their divisional artilleries, excepting three brigades of 18-pdrs.
*The 263rd Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division was attached to 54th (East Anglian) Division until 07:30 when it transferred to the 74th (Yeomanry) Division with the objective of defending the Sheikh Abbas Ridge.
*The 267th Brigade, 53rd (Welsh) Division was attached to the 52nd (Lowland) Division until 07:30 when it returned to the 53rd (Welsh) Division.
*The 272nd Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division was attached to Eastern Force artillery until 18:30 18 April when it came under orders of 74th (Yeomanry) Division.

The available guns had been deployed at a ratio of one gun every , compared with one gun every at Arras, on the Western Front, in April 1917. There were not enough guns to cover the front. The light field guns could not produce a sufficiently dense bombardment, and the thin barrage was not effectively strengthened by the naval guns. It quickly became clear that the gunfire from the warships, heavy artillery, and field howitzers, including the gas shells, had not silenced the defenders&#x27; artillery. Ten minutes before the infantry attack, 18-pdrs began their covering fire.

====Infantry attacks====

On the western side of Gaza in the coastal sector, from their position across the Wadi Ghuzze at Tel el Ujul, the 53rd (Welsh) Division was to attack and capture Samson Ridge, a great sand dune halfway between the Wadi Ghuzzee and Gaza. Then they were to advance and capture the western Ottoman defences between Gaza and the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, on the eastern side of Gaza, Eastern Attack&#x27;s 52nd (Lowland) Division on the left was to attack Ali Muntar, including the Labyrinth and Green Hill. On their right the 54th (East Anglian) Division, with the Imperial Camel Brigade attached to broaden the infantry attack, was to advance north from Sheikh Abbas towards Kh Sihan and Kh. el Bir.

; Coastal attack – 53rd (Welsh) Division
Brigadier General S. F. Mott&#x27;s 53rd (Welsh) Division began their advance from Tel el Ujul between the Mediterranean coast and the Rafa to Gaza road at 07:15 in extended order, moving across the sand hills fifteen minutes before the 52nd (Lowland) Division began to advance on their right. The 159th (Cheshire) Brigade on the left was to capture Sheikh Ajlin on the sea shore, while the 160th (Wales) Brigade on the right was to capture Sampson Ridge, each supported by one tank. They were to subsequently make contact with the 52nd (Lowland) Division on Ali Muntar in order to launch a joint attack from the Zowaiid trench in the west to the Romani trench on the Rafa to Gaza road.

The 159th Brigade on the left advanced fairly well until it reached about from Sheikh Ajlin, where orders required it to wait for the capture of Samson Ridge, due to the possibility of exposing their right flank. On their right, machine gun fire from the woodland area delayed the 160th Brigade&#x27;s attack on Samson Ridge, which was not captured until 13:00. This woodland area south west of Ali Muntar in the vicinity of Romani Trench and Outpost Hill, had been targeted with gas shells during the artillery bombardment. Despite heavy casualties, Samson Ridge was captured during a bayonet attack, but most of the officers and NCOs were casualties. By the time Samson Ridge was captured, a 2nd Lieutenant was in command of the battalion. They also captured 39 prisoners. Subsequently, the 159th Brigade captured Sheikh Ajlin on the coast without difficulty, while a counterattack on Samson Ridge against the 160th Brigade was unsuccessful. The division suffered 600 casualties, most of them during the fighting for Samson Ridge, but were unable to advance further until the 52nd (Lowland) Division came up to protect their right flank. The official British historian was critical of this division: &quot;It appears that the men of the 53rd Division still felt the effects of their losses, disappointments and fatigue in the battle fought three weeks earlier, for their advance, even up to Samson Ridge, had been much slower than that of the other two divisions.&quot;
;Eastern Attack – 52nd (Lowland) Division
On the left of Eastern Attack and extending the line of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, the leading brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade would begin their attack by pushing forward along the Es Sire Ridge with the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade echeloned behind to their right. Having captured the ridge, the 155th Brigade was to swing up to make a joint attack with the 156th Brigade on Green Hill and Ali Muntar, while their 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade remained in Eastern Attack reserve.

The advance by the Eastern Attack, from their consolidated positions at El Burjabye, Mansura Ridge and Sheikh Abbas, began at 07:30, fifteen minutes after the attack by the 53rd (Welsh) Division. The 155th Brigade moved along the spine of the Es Sire Ridge, with deep gullies on either flank. The 5th Battalion, of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers on the left, was flank guard against the woodlands on the western slope of the ridge, which had been targeted by gas shells during the artillery bombardment, with the 4th Battalion Scots Fusiliers on their right. The 4th Battalion King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers was in support. When the leading troops and the tank reached the gullies between Queen&#x27;s and Lee&#x27;s Hills on Es Sire Ridge, the tank nose-dived into a gully. However, the second tank took its place and by 08:15, Lee&#x27;s Hill was occupied.

Having secured Es Sire Ridge, the 155th Brigade&#x27;s attack towards Outpost Hill came under artillery and machine gun fire from their front and left flank, from the direction of the Romani trench and the Labyrinth. Until the 53rd (Welsh) Division captured Samson Ridge at 13:00, the 155th Brigade on the left flank of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, was exposed to heavy fire from rifles and machine guns. The 5th Battalion King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, following the remaining tank continued the attack, wheeling slightly away to the left to attack and occupy the Ottoman lunette fortification (two faces forming a projecting angle on two flanks), on Outpost Hill at 10:00. Meanwhile, the 4th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers suffered very heavy casualties while attacking Middlesex Hill to the northeast and was stopped within of their objective.

By this time the shortage of artillery shells was beginning to affect the attack. Had Middlesex Hill, Green Hill, and Ali Muntar, all within a relatively small area, been heavily bombarded, the 52nd (Lowland) Division&#x27;s third brigade could have dominated Gaza. Instead, hostile fire from the woodland area continued to target the 155th Brigade, and an hour after capturing Outpost Hill the 5th Battalion King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers were forced to withdraw after being heavily counterattacked. After hand–to–hand fighting, Outpost Hill was recaptured by the 4th Battalion King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, reinforced by the 5th Battalion King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers and the 5th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers. This lunette fortification continued to be held by the 155th Brigade during the afternoon, despite continuing counterattacks. After all the senior officers became casualties the 70 survivors were withdrawn, minutes before the 7th (Blythswood) Battalion Highland Light Infantry (157th Brigade), under heavy Ottoman artillery fire, arrived from Eastern Force reserve to reinforce them. The Highland Light Infantry battalion was forced to dig in just to the south of Outpost Hill.

The attack of the 156th Brigade was held up at 10:00 until the right of the 155th Brigade recommenced their advance. However, shortly afterwards the 156th Brigade&#x27;s 8th Battalion Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) was stopped by fire from Middlesex and Outpost Hills. They were caught out in the open for five hours, with their right flank exposed to constant fire mainly from Green Hill, as a consequence of the 54th (East Anglian) Division on their right flank advancing out of sight. After the 156th Brigade made a slight withdrawal, effective divisional artillery fire halted a strong Ottoman counterattack from Ali Muntar at about 15:30.

Meanwhile, the 157th Brigade, less the 7th Battalion supporting the 155th Brigade, moved forward from reserve below Mansura Ridge to Lee&#x27;s Hill and Blazed Hill. A planned joint attack timed for 16:00 was delayed, and at 16:40 Eastern Force ordered the infantry to &quot;discontinue the advance and dig in&quot; from east of Heart Hill (in touch with the 53rd (Welsh) Division) through Outpost Hill to the right of the 54th (East Anglian) Division near Kh en Hamus (also called Kh. en Namus). The 157th Brigade relieved the 155th Brigade, which had suffered 1,000 casualties from a strength of 2,500. Regarding the names of the numerous locations in the Gaza area, the official British historian notes, &quot;new names appear with each new attack.&quot;
;Eastern Attack – 54th (East Anglian) Division
On the left of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, advancing from Sheikh Abbas, the 162nd (East Midland) Brigade stretched from the intersection of the Wadi Mukaddeme with the Gaza to Beersheba road in the west, to the 163rd (Norfolk &amp; Suffolk) Brigade on the right advanced on a front, its right towards the north east to an Ottoman redoubt northwest of Kh Sihan, with the Imperial Camel Brigade on their right. The 161st (Essex) Brigade formed a divisional reserve.

The attack by the 162nd Brigade on the left was almost immediately fired on by artillery from behind Ali Muntar and by machine guns and mountain guns firing from nearby hostile trenches. The 10th Battalion London Regiment attacked on the left with the 4th Battalion Northamptonshire Regiment on the right, and the 11th Battalion London Regiment in support. During the attack the left half of the 10th Battalion London Regiment became separated from their right. This occurred when the left section faced a non-connected line of trenches, through which they were able to fight their way across the Gaza to Beersheba road at 08:30, forcing an artillery gun to withdraw. A member of the Signal Section twice successfully climbed telegraph poles and cut the line, before being killed during a third attempt by an artillery shell. The left section of the 10th Battalion London Regiment became completely isolated from the right section when a gap of formed between the two sections of the battalion. They had also advanced out of sight of the 156th Brigade (52nd Division) on their left, and although their exposed left flank on the Wadi Mukaddeme was partly covered by the advance of two machine gun sections, the left section of the 10th Battalion was &quot;hopelessly exposed.&quot; Subsequently, the 52nd (Lowland) Division advanced their right to ease the situation, but the advanced group was eventually forced to withdraw back across the road when two Ottoman battalions counterattacked strongly. They were forced back another before supporting machine guns in the Wadi Mukaddeme stopped the counterattack. Meanwhile, the right half of the 10th Battalion London Regiment had kept touch with the 4th Battalion Northamptonshire Regiment, which was held up from Ottoman trenches. A small party from the Northamptonshire Regiment, including Lewis gunners, attacked a parapet, shooting Ottoman soldiers defenders at point blank range, &quot;but this small party was eventually destroyed.&quot;
The attack by the 163rd (Norfolk &amp; Suffolk) Brigade (on the east of the 162nd Brigade) was led by a tank towards an Ottoman redoubt northwest of Kh. Sihan. They advanced with the 4th Battalion Norfolk Regiment on the left and the 5th Battalion Norfolk Regiment on the right. While fighting their way to within of their objective, about two thirds of the 4th Battalion Norfolk Regiment became casualties while the remainder were pinned down. Despite being reinforced by the 8th Battalion Hampshire Regiment, no more ground was gained during fighting, which saw the Hampshires also suffer very heavy losses. Meanwhile, at 09:00 the tank, followed by part of the 5th Battalion Norfolk Regiment on the right, entered a redoubt, capturing 20 prisoners and killing others of the hostile garrison. The fire from several hostile artillery batteries was concentrated on the redoubt, destroying the tank and killing most of the infantrymen. So many casualties were suffered by this battalion that they were unable to withstand a strong counterattack, during which the survivors were captured. The few who managed to escape were forced back to the ridge from which they had launched their attack. These three battalions lost 1,500 men, including two commanding officers and all twelve company commanders. At 13:00 the 161st (Essex) Brigade was ordered to reinforce the line held by the 163rd Brigade. Subsequently, the 5th Battalion Suffolk Regiment (163rd Brigade), and the 6th Battalion Essex Regiment (161st Brigade) made a fresh attack on the redoubt which had briefly been captured by the 5th Battalion Norfolk Regiment. At 14:20, before this advance had become &quot;seriously engaged&quot;, orders were received for the whole line to stand fast. Eastern Force ordered the divisions to dig in on the line they occupied. During the battle three tanks were captured by the Ottoman defenders.

On the right of the 163rd Brigade, the Imperial Camel Brigade—reinforced by one battalion of the 161st Brigade (54th Division)—advanced from Dumb-bell Hill. The 1st Battalion Imperial Camel Brigade advanced to occupy Tank redoubt on the left of the line, while the 3rd Battalion Imperial Camel Brigade crossed the Gaza to Beersheba road and temporarily occupied both &quot;Jack&quot; and &quot;Jill&quot; positions to the east of Kh. Sihan. They withdrew when the 4th Light Horse Brigade on their right was forced to withdraw during an Ottoman counterattack.

====Mounted attacks====

The Desert Column was deployed on the right of the Imperial Camel Brigade attached to Eastern Force, with the Imperial Mounted Division with the 17th Motor Machine Gun Battery was attached on the left, attacking towards the Atawineh redoubt, while the Anzac Mounted Division with the 7th Light Car Patrol attached covered their right flank and attacked towards the Hareira redoubt. Anzac Mounted Division was also to remain prepared to exploit any gaps in the Ottoman line. The mounted force supported the main infantry attack until either the defenders withdrew or a gap was forced in the front line.

;Atawineh – Imperial Mounted Division
At 06:30, one hour before the infantry attack began, the Imperial Mounted Division advanced on a wide front towards the Atawineh and Hairpin redoubts. On the left, the 4th Light Horse Brigade continued the line of the Imperial Camel Brigade to the Wadi el Baha, south east of Gaza. Then the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the 5th Mounted Brigade on the extreme right continued the line, all attacking Atawineh on a front, with the 6th Mounted Brigade in divisional reserve. After approaching mounted, they were to launch their attack dismounted, when one quarter of the troopers would be holding four horses each, in led horses. The Imperial Mounted Division&#x27;s attack was supported by the Inverness and Ayrshire Batteries escorted by the 3rd Squadron of the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment (New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, Anzac Mounted Division).

With its left in touch with the Imperial Camel Brigade, the 4th Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s dismounted advance captured a position overlooking the Gaza to Beersheba road near Kh. Sihan. To their right, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was by 09:15 ordered to halt its advance, as its forward position was attracting fire. They were close to the Atawineh redoubt, having captured 70 prisoners, but the brigade began to suffer enfilading fire from the narrow spur known as Sausage Ridge to the southeast of the Wadi el Baha.

;Sausage Ridge – 5th Mounted and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades (Anzac Mounted Division)

This strongly held position to the southeast of the Atawineh position was being attacked by the 5th Mounted Brigade on the right of the Imperial Mounted Division. Their embattled attack was reinforced at 09:30 by the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment (New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, Anzac Mounted Division), although the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades was to be prepared for a mounted attack. As the New Zealanders advanced with four machine guns under cover of fire from the Ayrshire Battery, the right of the mounted brigade was being forced back by the machine gun fire of an Ottoman battalion on the ridge. The New Zealanders took the pressure off the 5th Mounted Brigade, supported at one point by effective fire from two and a half Horse Artillery Batteries. The Somerset and Ayrshire Batteries and all available machine guns concentrated fire on Sausage Ridge, while the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment captured the southern end of the ridge. However, Ottoman fire from Hairpin redoubt at the northern end of Sausage Ridge near the Gaza to Beersheba road stopped their advance. At this stage, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment was ordered to reinforce the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment and the 5th Mounted Brigade. At around noon, the remainder of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade advanced at the trot, with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment on the left. Although hostile aircraft bombed them and artillery fire also caused severe casualties, the machine guns were placed in positions between from the Hairpin redoubt to produce effective fire, with advancing Ottoman troops only away.
The strong counterattacks suffered by Eastern Attack extended eastwards and, at 14:00, a large Ottoman force supported by artillery was attacking along the whole front held by the Imperial Mounted Division. The 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades were pushed back some distance, suffering numerous casualties, while the 6th Mounted Brigade in reserve was sent to reinforce the line. One regiment filled a gap which had developed between the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades, while two regiments reinforced the 5th Mounted Brigade, supported by fire from the 263rd Brigade RFA. Together they held the Ottoman counterattack and no further ground was lost before nightfall put an end to the fighting.

; Hareira – 1st Light Horse Brigade (Anzac Mounted Division)
While the 22nd Mounted Brigade (Anzac Mounted Division) in reserve moved to Tel el Fara on the Wadi Ghuzzee, south of Hiseia, to cover the right of the Imperial Mounted Division and guard engineers developing water wells in the area, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was ordered to make a dismounted attack towards Hareira on the extreme right of the battle line. Before noon, the 1st Light Horse Brigade had advanced to occupy Baiket es Sana. In the afternoon, while the Ottoman counterattacked the Eastern Force and the Imperial Mounted Division, on their left a hostile force marched out from Hareira to counterattack the 1st Light Horse Brigade. The light horsemen were also attacked on their flank by a regiment of the Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division from Tel esh Sheria. They advanced to the attack between the Wadis esh Sheria and Imleih. Fire from the 1st Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s Hotchkiss and Vickers machine guns, with the support of the Leicester Battery, stopped the counterattack.

Although the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was to be prepared for a mounted attack, the 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade) held a wide stretch of front line south of the Wadi Imleih. Here they were attacked by a squadron of Ottoman cavalry, supported by another cavalry regiment and a force of Bedouin. With their rifles on their backs the light horsemen were defenceless in mounted attack and they were forced back under cover of their machine gun detachments before eventually halting the Ottoman advance. Near dark, a threatened counterattack by infantry from Beersheba on the extreme right of the line failed to develop. The Anzac Mounted Division retired to water in the Wadi Ghuzzee at Heseia where they were shelled, causing some casualties.

==Aftermath==
===Cessation of EEF attacks===
Darkness ended fighting with anticipation for a renewal of the battle the next day. Although the EEF infantry brigades had succeeded in entering the Ottoman trenches at several points, they were too weakened by the fierce defence to retain their gains during strong counterattacks. Towards the end of the afternoon, it had become apparent there was &quot;no prospect of success on any portion of the front&quot;, and offensive operations ended after the Ottoman counterattack was forced back. Dobell received reports from his divisional commanders describing the state of the troops, the low supply of ammunition, and the estimated 6,000 casualties. He decided to postpone the attack for twenty-four hours and reported to Murray that he was in agreement with the divisional commanders that another assault would only result in more losses. Murray agreed.

The 53rd (Welsh) Division held Samson Ridge, and the 52nd (Lowland) Division held the line at the foot of Outpost Hill where construction of new defences at Heart Hill and Blazed Hill were begun. Although ordered not to abandon any ground, the position of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, out in the open and swept by fire, could not be maintained. The division was forced to withdraw to a position near Sheikh Abbas where they made contact with the 74th Division. The Imperial Camel Brigade, whose right was close to Kh. Sihan, covered this withdrawal, before withdrawing in turn at 19:45 to Charing Cross, southwest of Sheikh Abbas. Desert Column was withdraw to an outpost line extending from the right of the 54th (East Anglian) Division near Dumb-bell Hill on the edge of the Sheikh Abbas Ridge, through Munkheile south of the Wadi el Baha, to a point on the Wadi Ghuzzee about north of Shellal at Hiseia.

An Ottoman counterattack was anticipated on 20 April, when German aircraft bombed EEF camps and Ottoman cavalry massed at Hareira. This threat did not &quot;seriously develop&quot; after the Ottoman cavalry was bombed by three B.E.s and two Martinsydes. Although no general counterattack occurred, there were numerous local attacks. One of these attacks, which attempted to advance down the Wadi Sihan, was stopped by the 54th (East Anglian) Division&#x27;s artillery.

===Casualties===
During the battle the Ottoman defenders suffered between 82 and 402 killed, between 1,337 and 1,364 wounded, and between 242 and 247 missing. About 200 Ottoman prisoners were captured.
Between 17 and 20 April, EEF lost 6,444 casualties. The infantry suffered 5,328 casualties; 2,870 of these were from the 54th (East Anglian) Division and 1,828 from the 163rd Brigade alone. The 52nd (Lowland) Division suffered 1,874 casualties, the 53rd (Welsh) Division 584, the Imperial Camel Brigade 345 casualties, the Imperial Mounted Division 547 casualties, and the Anzac Mounted Division 105 casualties. Only one brigade in each of the 52nd (Lowland) and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions was intact or had suffered only light casualties. The 74th Division had not been engaged.

Official casualty figures include 509 killed, 4,359 wounded, and 1,534 missing; including 272 prisoners of war, while unofficially the figure was much higher at 17,000. A slightly lower figure of 14,000 has also been claimed. The 10th Light Horse Regiment, (3rd Light Horse Brigade, Imperial Mounted Division) lost 14 officers and almost half the regiment&#x27;s other ranks killed or wounded. Three months later on 12 July, General Allenby reported &quot;Units are, however, below strength, and 5,150 infantry and 400 yeomanry reinforcements are required now to complete the four divisions and mounted now in the line to full strength.&quot; The Gaza war cemetery bears silent witness to the casualties which were much more severe than the British public was told.

===Consequences===
The defeat of the EEF boosted the Ottoman Fourth Army&#x27;s morale. Within weeks Kress von Kressenstein was reinforced by the 7th and the 54th Divisions, and by October 1917 the Eighth Army commanded by Kress von Kressenstein had been established with headquarters at Huleikat north of Huj. The EEF&#x27;s strength, which could have supported an advance to Jerusalem, was now decimated. Murray and Dobell were relieved of their commands and sent back to England.

The line secured during the battle by the EEF was consolidated and strengthened and trench warfare established from Sheikh Ailin on the Mediterranean coast to Sheikh Abbas and on to Tel el Jemmi. This line was to be held for six months, during the so-called Stalemate in Southern Palestine, when plans for a fresh effort in the autumn were developed to capture Gaza and Jerusalem.

<doc id="496618" wikidata="Q184752" url="?curid=496618" title="Text-based user interface">
<text>In computing, text-based user interfaces (TUI) (alternately terminal user interfaces, to reflect a dependence upon the properties of computer terminals and not just text), is a retronym describing a type of user interface (UI) common as an early form of human–computer interaction, before the advent of bitmapped displays and modern conventional graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Like modern GUIs, they can use the entire screen area and may accept mouse and other inputs. They may also use color and often structure the display using box-drawing characters such as ┌ and ╣. The modern context of use is usually a terminal emulator.
== Types of text terminals ==
From text application&#x27;s point of view, a text screen (and communications with it) can belong to one of three types (here ordered in order of decreasing accessibility):

# A genuine text mode display, controlled by a video adapter or the central processor itself. This is a normal condition for a locally running application on various types of personal computers and mobile devices. If not deterred by the operating system, a smart program may exploit the full power of a hardware text mode.
# A text mode emulator. Examples are xterm for X Window System and win32 console (in a window mode) for Microsoft Windows. This usually supports programs which expect a real text mode display, but may run considerably slower. Certain functions of an advanced text mode, such as an own font uploading, almost certainly become unavailable.
# A remote text terminal. The communication capabilities usually become reduced to a serial line or its emulation, possibly with few ioctl()s as an out-of-band channel in such cases as Telnet and Secure Shell. This is the worst case, because software restrictions hinder the use of capabilities of a remote display device.

Under Linux and other Unix-like systems, a program easily accommodates to any of the three cases because the same interface (namely, standard streams) controls the display and keyboard. See below for comparison to Windows.

Many TUI programming libraries are available to help developers build TUI applications. 

== On ANSI-compatible terminals ==
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard ANSI X3.64 defines a standard set of escape sequences that can be used to drive terminals to create TUIs (see ANSI escape code). Escape sequences may be supported for all three cases mentioned in the above section, allowing arbitrary cursor movements and color changes.
However, not all terminals follow this standard, and many non-compatible but functionally equivalent sequences exist.

== Under DOS and Microsoft Windows ==

On IBM Personal Computers and compatibles, the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) and DOS system calls provide a way to write text on the screen, and the ANSI.SYS driver could process standard ANSI escape sequences. However, programmers soon learned that writing data directly to the screen buffer was far faster and simpler to program, and less error-prone; see VGA-compatible text mode for details. This change in programming methods resulted in many DOS TUI programs. The Windows console environment is notorious for its emulation of certain EGA/VGA text mode features, particularly random access to the text buffer, even if the application runs in a window. On the other hand, programs running under Windows (both native and DOS applications) have much less control of the display and keyboard than Linux and DOS programs can have, because of aforementioned Windows console layer.

Most often those programs used a blue background for the main screen, with white or yellow characters, although commonly they had also user color customization. They often used box-drawing characters in IBM&#x27;s code page 437. Later, the interface became deeply influenced by graphical user interfaces (GUI), adding pull-down menus, overlapping windows, dialog boxes and GUI widgets operated by mnemonics or keyboard shortcuts. Soon mouse input was added – either at text resolution as a simple colored box or at graphical resolution thanks to the ability of the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and Video Graphics Array (VGA) display adapters to redefine the text character shapes by software – providing additional functions.

Some notable programs of this kind were Microsoft Word, DOS Shell, WordPerfect, Norton Commander, Turbo Vision based Borland Turbo Pascal and Turbo C (the latter included the conio library), Lotus 1-2-3 and many others. Some of these interfaces survived even during the Microsoft Windows 3.1x period in the early 1990s. For example, the Microsoft C 6.0 compiler, used to write true GUI programs under 16-bit Windows, still has its own TUI.

Since its start, Microsoft Windows includes a console to display DOS software. Later versions added the Windows console as a native interface for command-line interface and TUI programs. The console usually opens in window mode, but it can be switched to full, true text mode screen and vice versa by pressing the Alt and Enter keys together. Full-screen mode is not available in Windows Vista and later, but may be used with some workarounds.

Windows Terminal is a multi-tabbed terminal emulator that Microsoft has developed for Windows 10 and later as a replacement for Windows Console. 

The Windows Subsystem for Linux which was added to Windows by Microsoft in 2019, supports running Linux text-based apps on Windows, within Windows console, Windows Terminal, and other Windows-based terminals.

== Under Unix-like systems ==
In Unix-like operating systems, TUIs are often constructed using the terminal control library &quot;curses&quot;, or &quot;ncurses&quot; (a mostly compatible library), or the alternative &quot;S-Lang&quot; library. The advent of the &quot;curses&quot; library with Berkeley Unix created a portable and stable API for which to write TUIs. The ability to talk to various text terminal types using the same interfaces led to more widespread use of &quot;visual&quot; Unix programs, which occupied the entire terminal screen instead of using a simple line interface. This can be seen in text editors such as vi, mail clients such as pine or mutt, system management tools such as SMIT, SAM, FreeBSD&#x27;s Sysinstall and web browsers such as lynx. Some applications, such as w3m, and older versions of pine and vi use the less-able termcap library, performing many of the functions associated with curses within the application. Custom TUI applications based on &quot;widgets&quot; can be easily developed using the dialog program (based on ncurses), or the Whiptail program (based on S-Lang).

In addition, the rise in popularity of Linux brought many former DOS users to a Unix-like platform, which has fostered a DOS influence in many TUIs. The program minicom, for example, is modeled after the popular DOS program Telix. Some other TUI programs, such as the Twin desktop, were ported over.

Most Unix-like operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) support virtual consoles, typically accessed through a Ctrl-Alt-F key combination. For example, under Linux up to 64 consoles may be accessed (12 via function keys), each displaying in full-screen text mode.

The free software program GNU Screen provides for managing multiple sessions inside a single TUI, and so can be thought of as being like a window manager for text-mode and command-line interfaces. Tmux can also do this.

The proprietary macOS text editor BBEdit includes a &quot;shell worksheet&quot; function that works as a full-screen shell window. The free Emacs text editor can run a shell inside of one of its buffers to provide similar functionality. There are several shell implementations in Emacs, but only codice_1 is suitable for running TUI programs. The other common shell modes, codice_2 and codice_3 only emulate command lines and TUI programs will complain &quot;Terminal is not fully functional&quot; or display a garbled interface. The free Vim and Neovim text editors have terminal windows (simulating xterm). The feature is intended for running jobs, parallel builds, or tests, but can also be used (with window splits and tab pages) as a lightweight terminal multiplexer.

== OpenVMS ==
VAX/VMS (later known as OpenVMS) had a similar facility to &quot;curses&quot; known as the Screen Management facility or SMG. This could be invoked from the command line or called from programs using the SMG$ library.

== Oberon ==

Another kind of TUI is the primary interface of the Oberon operating system, first released in 1988 and still maintained. Unlike most other text-based user interfaces, Oberon does not use a text-mode console or terminal, but requires a large bit-mapped display, on which text is the primary target for mouse clicks. Analogous to a link in hypertext, a command has the format codice_4 and is activated with a mouse middle-click. Text displayed anywhere on the screen can be edited, and if formatted with the required command syntax, can be middle-clicked and executed. Any text file containing suitably-formatted commands can be used as a so-called tool text, thus serving as a user-configurable menu. Even the output of a previous command can be edited and used as a new command. This approach is radically different from both conventional dialogue-oriented console menus or command-line interfaces.

Since it does not use graphical widgets, only plain text, but offers comparable functionality to a GUI with a tiling window manager, it is referred to as a Text User Interface or TUI. For a short introduction, see the 2nd paragraph on page four of the first published &quot;Report on the Oberon System&quot;.

Oberon&#x27;s UI influenced the design of the Acme text editor and email client for the Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating system.

== In embedded systems ==
Modern embedded systems are capable of displaying TUI on a monitor like personal computers. This functionality is usually implemented using specialized integrated circuits, modules, or using FPGA.

Video circuits or modules are usually controlled using VT100-compatible command set over UART, FPGA designs usually allow direct video memory access.

== Other uses ==
* The full screen editor of the Commodore 64 8-bit computers was advanced in its market segment for its time. Users could move the cursor over the entire screen area, entering and editing BASIC program lines, as well as direct mode commands. All Commodore 8-bit computers used the PETSCII character set, which included character glyphs suitable for making a TUI.
* Apple&#x27;s Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop programming environment included Commando, a TUI shell. It was the inspiration for BBEdit&#x27;s shell worksheet.
* Later Apple II models included MouseText, a set of graphical glyphs used for making a TUI.
* The Corvus Concept computer of 1982 used a function key-based text interface on a full-page pivoting display.
